    "title": "What Disney's new CEO pick tells us about the future of media",
    "description": "Nearly a decade ago, Disney made a giant bet on streaming. Now it's going in a different direction.",
    "fullText": "In February 2020, Disney announced that it had picked a successor to CEO Bob Iger: Bob Chapek, who was running the company's parks unit.\n\nSix years later, Disney is running it back. This time, it has picked parks boss Josh D'Amaro to replace Iger, who swears he's really leaving Disney for good this time.\n\nThe most obvious thing to say about D'Amaro's selection is that the parks business he oversees is Disney's most important business — a reliable profit and growth driver.\n\nBut a counterpoint to that is worth thinking about, too. It means the company's streaming business — the one Iger made a huge bet on back in 2017 — isn't the key to the company's future.\n\nPuck's Julia Alexander, a longtime Disney reporter who also spent a year working on the company's strategy, talked to me about D'Amaro's rise and what it tells us about Disney and the broader media business. Below is an edited excerpt of our conversation on my Channels podcast this week.\n\nPeter Kafka: Why did Disney, for the second time in six years, pick the guy who runs the parks business to run the entire company?\n\nJulia Alexander: Because going forward, Disney will be more of an experiences company than it already has been, and less of a media-first company.\n\nDisney's always been an experiences business. They're investing $60 billion [over 10 years] in that segment. It grew 6% in 2025, finishing at just over $36 billion. In the first quarter of the new year, it saw $10 billion in revenue. These are the basic data points that explain why D'Amaro is there.\n\nBut the fandom reason is that it's really difficult to try and predict what entertainment will look like a decade from now, let alone what Disney's role in entertainment will look like a decade from now — with YouTube coming in on the TV sets, with Instagram, with TikTok, with things that we haven't even seen yet.\n\nIs the parks business growing because more people are going to parks every year? Or is it growing because Disney has figured out how to extract more money from the people who are going to parks?\n\nDefinitely the latter. It's this idea that people are willing to spend more on luxury experiences.\n\nPeople will continue to spend because it is an experience that they're not going to get elsewhere, which means that [Disney] can monetize the customer at a higher rate than they're going to get in the content business.\n\nBeyond the fact that D'Amaro runs parks, and parks are the key engine to Disney, what has he done during his tenure that suggests that he's really good at it?\n\nOverseeing the launch of parks in China — Hong Kong, Shanghai. He's also the one who led the deal on investing in Epic Games, and looking at what the digital theme park component may look like.\n\nThere's also a quality to him. Someone at Disney said this to me the other day: He said there's Walt-like quality to him — as in Walt Disney — that Bob Iger [also] has.\n\nUnlike the CEO of Apple or the CEO of Nike or any of these other big American brands, the CEO of Disney really means something to Disney fans.\n\nHe's a public figure. He walks the parks and people want to come up to him. They want to take photos with him.\n\nThis is something that Bob Chapek never had. He didn't want to hang out with the people who were creating his business, who were paying thousands of dollars to hang out in these parks.\n\nDana Walden, the other primary candidate for the job, is going to stay on with a new title of chief creative officer. She's supposed to run the film and TV business. Do they expect her to stick around?\n\nIf this was 2018, 2019 — the height of streaming subscribers and everyone investing in original content — I think the question of what happens to Dana Walden is much more interesting.\n\nIn 2026, streaming is a manageable operations business. The futurist component of it has gone away. Now it's just how do we get to 10% profit margins?\n\nWe know how it works. There's no mystery to running it. There's skill, but there's no mystery.\n\nBut just because Disney picked another parks guy, and just because parks is clearly the profit center of this company over the next 10 years, does not mean that Disney works as a non-media company. The media is so important to it.\n\nSo I think that D'Amaro will continue to focus on turning this very intangible adoration for intellectual property into tangible money at the parks level, but still rely on Walden and John Landgraf [who runs Disney's FX unit] and others to make sure that the content is keeping [customer] attention long term.\n\nSix years ago, right before the pandemic came to the US, Bob Iger announced that he didn't want to be CEO anymore, and the guy running parks back then — Bob Chapek — replaced him. It didn't work out, for a bunch of reasons — one of which was that Bob Iger kind of left him a mess. What is he leaving to Josh D'Amaro this time around?\n\nI think what Bob Iger has left Josh D'Amaro in 2026 versus what he left Bob Chapek in 2020 is a stark reality versus an optimistic hope. Streaming was [supposed to be] this reinvention of a business and of a behavior. You weren't just going to have a transition of customers, you're going to have a new customer. You were going to have a new type of content, a new type of monetization.\n\nAnd very quickly, in the first few years after the pandemic, what we started to see was that it was a business. It wasn't creating new behaviors, it was just old behaviors in a different format.\n\nThat was really hard to square with analysts on Wall Street, when you've spent the last four or five years telling them that streaming is the future of your business.\n\nThere was this idea that streaming was going to be defined by how many subscribers you had. You could spend whatever you wanted. It didn't really matter. There's a lot of similarities to what's happening in the AI industry right now: This idea of just grow, grow, grow, grow, and we'll figure out revenue later. And then it all came crashing down. And all of a sudden Wall Street said, 'Okay, well, are you making money on this? And are you making, not just money, but 20% profit margins? Cable money?'\n\nSo that was a period of time where Bob Chapek had to navigate truly outlandish expectations. There was a hope that this was going to revolutionize everything. Now streaming's a manageable business.\n\nWhat D'Amaro has is the stark reality of: 'We are not going to compete with YouTube. We are not going to compete with Instagram as they come to TV sets. We're not going to compete with TikTok. We're going to hope that some kind of theatrical strategy — lean on the \"Avatars\" and the Marvels — makes sense. We're going to hope that some of the Chinese theatrical market comes back.\n\nBut we don't have the optimism that we once did — that streaming is going to solve all of our woes, of the cable business declining and wiping out billions of dollars in profit. What we do have is a fundamental reality about what we can do with the parks business and what people are willing to spend on.'\n\nSo I think it's a perfect time for Iger to step back.\n\nHe's leaving at a time when there's not this optimism that whoever comes in is going to solve the entertainment and media business. It's an expectation that the guy who comes in is going to get us through this transitional period.",

    "fullText": "Disney's new CEO is sending a wink with his wardrobe, whether he means to or not.\n\nJosh D'Amaro, who takes the helm of the Mouse House next month, has drawn attention for dressing much like his soon-to-be predecessor, Bob Iger. Both men regularly don sweaters over collared shirts and have a penchant for jackets paired with white dress shirts. At a celebration for Disney's 70th Anniversary last year, the pair sported button-downs and dark slacks.\n\nWhile D'Amaro may just have a natural affinity for the same kind of attire that Iger sports, leadership experts say the similar look projects continuity to Disney's stakeholders. The familiarity may resonate at Disney, where Iger has led the company on and off for nearly two decades — though it raises a question of whether the rest of us should dress like the leaders we hope to one day succeed.\n\n\"You want to avoid looking like a carbon copy of the person,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International in Chicago. \"But there are elements that you want to keep if you can.\"\n\nThose elements should be modest, akin to how Apple CEO Tim Cook doesn't deviate too far from the black turtleneck and jeans his predecessor Steve Jobs regularly wore, suggested Jennifer Eggers, president of executive advisory firm LeaderShift Insights in Pennsylvania.\n\nA few years ago, she said a client of hers from a Fortune 200 retailer went overboard by wearing the same distinctive jewelry as his boss. When she met with his peers for feedback on his performance, several described him as a copycat.\n\n\"It really hurt him,\" said Eggers. \"We coached him, and he eventually lost his jewelry.\"\n\nStill, there can be benefits to mimicking a higher-up's sense of fashion when done subtly, added Akubuiro. \"People have a tendency to like people who are more like them,\" he said.\n\nJust keep in mind the fuzzy warm feeling may be temporary.\n\n\"It's effective as a bridge maybe, but not as a destination,\" said Eggers. \"Eventually, leadership credibility has to stand on its own.\"\n\nD'Amaro, who started at Disney in 1998 as a Disneyland business planner, faces a challenging road ahead no matter what he wears. He's tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nA post shared by Robert Iger (@robertiger)\n\nWhile D'Amaro's fashion style is similar to Iger's, Akubuiro said the business-casual look has also made sense for his role as a park executive.\n\n\"This is kind of the uniform of someone walking around the parks, and so it gives him a very accessible feel,\" Akubuiro said. \"When you're making a change, that accessibility is something that actually brings people in and gives them some confidence.\"",

    "description": "Disney's decision to tap Josh D'Amaro signals that the company wanted to go with a familiar, friendly face to push ahead into the AI era.",
    "fullText": "After a decade of ups and downs, Disney is picking a familiar, friendly face at the heart of its profit engine to lead the company into a new era.\n\nDisney's board just tapped Parks boss Josh D'Amaro to take over for longtime CEO Bob Iger, starting on March 18. Iger, who plans to retire as CEO for the second time, will remain in an advisor role before stepping aside for good later this year.\n\nAfter a decade marked by strategic changes and a failed succession, Disney is turning to the guy who runs its most reliable moneymaker to navigate a period of massive change in the entertainment industry.\n\nDisney's new CEO has his work cut out for him. The Mouse House's stock has only mustered an 11% gain in the last decade, compared to a more than threefold increase for the S&P 500. And while Disney's parks are gushing cash, the streaming business isn't yet making enough money to offset the steady erosion of the company's ever-fading cable networks.\n\nHowever, D'Amaro appears as well-positioned as any possible Iger successor to lead Disney into the next decade.\n\nNot only is D'Amaro intimately familiar with the company's most lucrative business, but he also seems to have the charm and leadership acumen needed to lead a juggernaut like Disney. That's in contrast to former CEO Bob Chapek, who took over after Iger's first retirement and was known as a gruff, business-minded executive who lacked Iger's high level of charisma.\n\nYet D'Amaro isn't just a likable face. Here are three points about Disney's choice of D'Amaro and what his leadership could mean for the company.\n\nWhile it's still too early to say how D'Amaro might run things, the board's decision to go with a company insider, who happened to be the consensus pick, signals a preference for stability, analysts and leadership experts told Business Insider.\n\nD'Amaro — who turns 55 on February 10 — has been at Disney since 1998. As Disney's experience chairman, D'Amaro oversees the parks division, which has been a financial standout compared to the fast-eroding linear TV business.\n\n\"The company appears to be reorganizing in ways that shore up his shortcomings,\" Pozner told Business Insider, referring to D'Amaro.\n\nDisney didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on its reasoning.\n\nBecause D'Amaro is 20 years younger than Iger, D'Amaro could have a lengthy run in the top job, she said.\n\n\"He's still got a long time horizon in front of him,\" Pozner said. \"This is really planning for the future. And I think that's a great signal about stability.\"\n\nAnalyst Joe Bonner of Argus Research said it's \"hard to really tell much about anyone under that big shadow\" of Iger.\n\nD'Amaro is known among colleagues for being a likable guy who takes selfies with parkgoers.\n\n\"D'Amaro definitely feels like a man of the people,\" Pozner said.\n\nD'Amaro is \"broadly popular\" and known for being approachable, said a Disney ad sales staffer who said they'd been in the same room as D'Amaro but hadn't met him. This person added that the incoming CEO seems \"very well-liked over at Parks\" and added that it's \"always a good sign when people love working for someone.\"\n\nThat affability could help him forge relationships in other divisions of the entertainment conglomerate — and navigate a new course while Iger initially remains on the board.\n\nPozner said D'Amaro's relative youth and his \"flesh-pressing image\" could signal that Disney's board wants to help the company maintain its friendly perception. That matters because of criticisms, for example, that the costs of the theme parks have become out of reach for some families.\n\nThat concern has worried some investors, who wonder how much consumers will be willing to hand over to spend time at the happiest place on earth, Ben Barringer, global head of technology research at the UK wealth management firm Quilter Cheviot, told Business Insider.\n\nBarringer said that D'Amaro will likely have to develop new skills to match his broader remit.\n\n\"Dealing with Parks people is different from dealing with studio people,\" Barringer said.\n\nIt could help that Walden is staying at the Mouse House in a major role.\n\nD'Amaro will likely also want to work on his influence skills, Barringer said, in part because moving the company through the big upheaval in the entertainment industry won't be easy.\n\n\"Hollywood faces quite a lot of disruption,\" he said. The ascent of AI and Disney's partnership with OpenAI are signs that more change is coming, Barringer said.\n\n\"Embracing the disruptive threat and trying to leverage it is a good way to start,\" Barringer said, referring to AI.",

    "description": "Disney announced it will appoint experiences chairman Josh D'Amaro as its next CEO, succeeding Bob Iger, who has already come out of retirement once.",
    "fullText": "Disney has selected its parks head as the successor to CEO Bob Iger. Now, the Mouse House has to hope that history doesn't repeat itself.\n\nJosh D'Amaro, a 28-year Disney veteran who's run the company's experiences division since 2020, will take over for Iger, who's retiring for the second time, on March 18.\n\nDisney announced the CEO succession plan on Tuesday, the day after posting first-quarter results for its 2026 financial year. Iger will remain on Disney's board as a senior advisor, the company said in its filing.\n\nD'Amaro was named CEO after a unanimous vote by Disney's board on Monday, Disney said in a statement.\n\nDisney's board chairman, James Gorman, said in a memo to employees that D'Amaro \"demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of what makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace.\"\n\nAnother factor in D'Amaro's favor is that Disney's parks have become crucial to the company's success, as his Experiences division accounted for more than 70% of Disney's operating income last quarter. Under his watch, the division has grown to record profits and rebounded from the pandemic.\n\nD'Amaro beat out Dana Walden, who oversees Disney's entertainment and TV portfolio, for the top job. The two were largely seen in the industry as the frontrunners in the months leading up to the announcement. Walden will become Disney's president and chief creative officer on March 18, the same day D'Amaro takes over as CEO.\n\nOutgoing CEO Iger called D'Amaro an \"exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO\" in a statement.\n\nIt may be tempting to draw parallels between D'Amaro and Iger's first successor: Bob Chapek, who'd also run Disney's experiences business before becoming CEO in early 2020. Iger appeared to regret his choice of Chapek and seemingly undermined the man he called \"Little Bob,\" CNBC reported. Chapek's brief stint as Disney CEO was widely viewed as a bumpy, tumultuous tenure.\n\nDisney's CEO succession process was much more thorough this time. It was led by Gorman, a former Morgan Stanley CEO, who had successfully navigated his own leadership transition.\n\nUnder D'Amaro's leadership, Disney's experiences business has started to carry the company financially. The growth in experiences has been driven by nearly annual price hikes at Disney's parks, which have helped generate more revenue per guest.\n\nDespite those price increases, D'Amaro — a charming 54-year-old — has remained well-liked among Disney fans, some of whom have even argued that higher prices could reduce crowds, thereby improving their experience.\n\nHowever, some Disney superfans said they were skeptical that D'Amaro was a better choice than Walden, who has run the company's crucial streaming business and has strong relationships in Hollywood.\n\n\"You can only extract so much out of the parks,\" said Lucas Lozano, a Disney fan based in Texas.\n\nDisney superfan Shae Noble, who just renewed her annual pass to Disney World, said she's \"losing faith\" in Disney leadership as park prices rise and said she's \"nervous about leadership changes after what happened before,\" referring to Chapek.\n\nLozano expressed a similar concern: \"Let's not forget: Bob Chapek once was in D'Amaro's position before he was named CEO, and look what happened.\"\n\nD'Amaro will also have to win over Wall Street, which has been lukewarm on the Mouse House for the last few years. Disney's stock is down 1% over the past year and has lost a third of its value since its peak five years ago.\n\nD'Amaro's own fiefdom, Disney's experiences business, appears to be firing on all cylinders, though there are questions about how much more it can push up prices.\n\nDisney's direct-to-consumer business is a mixed bag. Streaming has become profitable and steadily added subscribers. However, Disney+ and Hulu's share of US TV viewing has barely budged for years, according to Nielsen data.\n\nDisney has a few ideas for jumpstarting engagement, including adding AI and short-form video to Disney+ after a deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. It's also working to transition ESPN into the streaming future.\n\nD'Amaro will need to look well beyond parks to set Disney up for success in the post-Iger era.",

D'Amaro must manage the company's declining TV networks, which have been ravaged by cord-cutting, while continuing to grow streaming profits, which haven't yet made up the difference.\n\nDana Walden, the head of Disney Entertainment who was the other leading contender for the top job, is getting promoted to president and chief creative officer, Disney said.\n\n\"Dana is one of the most accomplished creative leaders in entertainment and has done an outstanding job,\" Gorman told employees.\n\nAfter two stints and nearly two decades as CEO, Iger will cede his role to D'Amaro next month and serve as a senior advisor until the end of the year. Iger's tenure will be remembered as a transformative era in which Disney bought Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel, and entered into the streaming and AI age.\n\nRead the full memo from Gorman below:\n\nDear Disney Employees and Cast Members,\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to announce that Josh D'Amaro, Chairman of Disney Experiences, will be the next Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company, effective at the Annual Meeting on March 18. Josh possesses that rare combination of inspiring leadership and innovation with a keen eye for strategic growth opportunities and a deep passion for the Disney brand and its people — all of which make him the right person to take the helm as Disney's next CEO.\n\nThis is wonderful news for all of us at Disney and I know you will join me in congratulating Josh on this well-deserved appointment.\n\nOver the past three years, the Disney Board has undertaken an exhaustive and disciplined process to identify and prepare the right leader for Disney's next chapter. Josh demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of what makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace. He has collaborated with some of the biggest names in entertainment to bring their stories to life in our parks, showcasing the power of combining Disney storytelling with cutting-edge technology. The Board believes he is exceptionally well prepared to guide this global company forward.\n\nBob Iger, who has led Disney to unprecedented success during his nearly two decades as CEO, has provided extensive mentorship to Josh throughout the succession process, and will continue to serve as Senior Advisor until his retirement from the company at the end of the year. Bob returned from retirement in 2022 at the Board's request to stabilize the company and make it fit for purpose, and to prepare Disney for this moment with a strong leadership bench, including potential successors. He has achieved all of this and more, and the Board and I are deeply grateful to Bob for his longstanding dedication to Disney.\n\nWe also announced today that Dana Walden will assume the role of President and Chief Creative Officer of The Walt Disney Company, also effective at the Annual Meeting. Dana is one of the most accomplished creative leaders in entertainment and has done an outstanding job as Co-Chairman of Disney Entertainment since its formation in 2023. In this new role, she will report to Josh and work with him in ensuring that storytelling and creative expression across every audience touchpoint consistently reflect the brand, engage audiences at scale, and advance core business objectives — while driving enterprise-wide initiatives and translating vision into action.\n\nOver the past century since Walt and Roy founded this company, Disney has had a remarkable and storied history, built on creativity, imagination, and a unique ability to touch people's lives around the world. As we look to the future, we are lucky to have someone like Josh ready to guide this global company forward as CEO. We are also fortunate to have a deeply experienced management team in place, including Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman, ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, and the Disney executive officers. Their experience, judgment, and continuity will be an important asset to Josh as he begins this next chapter in Disney's history.\n\nAnd finally, after two years on the Disney Board, I can attest that this company's greatest strength is its people — the employees and Cast Members whose creativity, talent, and dedication bring the magic of Disney to life every day. On behalf of the Board and myself, I want to thank you for all you do as we prepare for this company's exciting next chapter. We are deeply honored to serve as your Directors.",

    "description": "Disney parks veteran Josh D'Amaro will soon take the torch from CEO Bob Iger. Get to know D'Amaro, who's been at Disney since 1998.",
    "fullText": "It's official: Josh D'Amaro is Disney's new top dog — or, in this case, mouse.\n\nD'Amaro, who oversees Disney's parks as its experiences chairman, was just chosen to succeed Bob Iger as CEO. Iger is set to step down on March 18, paving the way for D'Amaro to take over.\n\nD'Amaro is an \"exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO,\" Iger said in a statement. Disney's board voted unanimously for his promotion on Monday, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe incoming CEO has big shoes to fill, and much to learn about Disney's business beyond its parks, cruises, and products. D'Amaro will be tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nHere's what Disney fans, employees, and investors need to know about D'Amaro as he becomes CEO.\n\nD'Amaro, a Massachusetts native, shares a birthday with Iger, who is exactly 20 years older. He'll be 55 years old on February 10, as his eventual predecessor turns 75. The two also appear to have a similar fashion sense. Both D'Amaro and Iger regularly don sweaters over collared shirts, and have a penchant for jackets paired with white shirts.\n\nFrom childhood, D'Amaro was a Disney fan. He told the Orlando Business Journal in 2020 that his must-do Disney World ride is \"Peter Pan's Flight,\" which he said he and his siblings rode as kids — an experience he said he tries to recreate \"whenever I'm here.\"\n\nThe soon-to-be CEO studied business administration at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He had transferred in from New York's Skidmore College, where he studied art and sculpting but had doubts about how he'd make a living, The New York Times reported.\n\nAfter graduating in 1993, D'Amaro worked at Boston-based Gillette for a few years.\n\nD'Amaro began his Disney journey in 1998, working at Disneyland as a business planner. Twenty years later, he became president of Disneyland, before moving from Anaheim to Orlando a year later to take the same position at Disney World.\n\nBefore that role, D'Amaro had worked on the park's business development, marketing strategy, and sales teams. D'Amaro also had roles at Disney World's Animal Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland — a valuable experience, given how crucial China is to Disney's business.\n\nOutside the parks, D'Amaro had also worked in Disney's consumer products businesses as a VP of global licensing.\n\nAfter more than two decades at Disney, D'Amaro was promoted to Disney Experiences chairman to oversee parks, cruises, and consumer products in early 2020 — at the most difficult time possible amid a pandemic.\n\nD'Amaro filled a role left by then-CEO Bob Chapek, who was eventually pushed out and replaced by Iger, who had retired.\n\nUnder his tenure, Disney has continued to expand its parks business, including announcing its plans to launch a seventh park, located in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"For every one theme park visitor that we have in our existing experiences today, we believe there are 10 more out there that want to come and participate in the Disney experience,\" D'Amaro said in May at MoffettNathanson's media conference.\n\nUnder D'Amaro, an experiences business that slowed to a standstill during the pandemic roared back to life as Disney fans raced back to the parks after years of being cooped up at home.\n\nAs demand for Disney parks surged, so did prices. Park ticket costs have risen in each of the past four years, and profits, revenue, and visits have climbed as well.\n\nWhile Disney has received some criticism from fans for making its parks less affordable for middle-class families — with a slew of upcharges for fast-pass Lightning Lanes and costly food — those complaints don't appear to be hurting the company's bottom line.\n\nDisney's experiences segment just topped $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever, while its $3.3 billion in operating income made up more than 70% of the company's profit.\n\nAs CEO, D'Amaro must gain Wall Street's favor by pulling off similar feats in Disney's streaming, TV, and movie businesses. Disney's stock has fallen around 9% over the past year, and it's shed about 43% of its value from five years ago.\n\nAlthough another Iger unretirement and takeover is almost inconceivable, the longtime Disney leader has made clear that he's left the company on the right track, putting pressure on his successor.\n\nBoth the experiences and entertainment businesses \"have the ability to grow nicely into the future, given all the investments that we've made and the trajectory that we're on,\" Iger said on Disney's earnings call on Monday.\n\nIger also made it clear that his successor must be bold and make their own mark on Disney.\n\n\"When I came back three years ago, I had a tremendous amount that needed fixing,\" Iger said. \"But anyone who runs a company also knows that it can't just be about fixing. It has to be about preparing a company for its future and really putting in place, taking steps to create opportunities for growth.\"",

    "fullText": "Close to two years after losing a proxy fight to longtime Disney boss Bob Iger, billionaire investor Nelson Peltz is still a skeptic.\n\nActivist investor and Trian Partners founder Nelson Peltz said at a Florida event on Tuesday that Disney picked Josh D'Amaro as its new CEO because \"Iger needs a reason to stay on.\"\n\nPeltz said to expect an announcement from Iger saying, \"Josh doesn't know anything about the movie business, the entertainment business; therefore, I'm going to stay on and guide him.\"\n\n\"Poor Josh,\" Peltz said, with a laugh.\n\nD'Amaro's appointment as CEO was approved by Disney's board in a unanimous vote led by former Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, who managed his own succession at the bank.\n\nD'Amaro \"demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of what makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace,\" Gorman said in a statement, and the division he leads was more than 70% of the company's operating income last quarter. Iger, meanwhile, called D'Amaro the \"right person to become our next CEO.\"\n\nIger will remain at the company in a senior advisor role until the end of the year. This is Iger's second retirement from Disney. He previously tapped Bob Chapek, who'd also run Disney's experiences business before becoming CEO in early 2020. Iger returned from retirement in 2022 after Chapek's bumpy, tumultuous tenure.\n\nPeltz waged a proxy battle with Disney to gain board seats in early 2024, while criticizing its streaming division's losses, unstable stock, and uncertain succession plans. He sold his Disney shares after shareholders voted to support Iger.\n\nPeltz said D'Amaro has his work cut out for him when he takes over on March 18.\n\n\"I hope he's given the opportunity to do it,\" Peltz said.",

    "description": "Disney reported \"headwinds\" in international visitation to its American parks as foreign travelers continue to avoid the US.",
    "fullText": "Looks like even \"The Most Magical Place on Earth\" isn't enough to entice foreign travelers who are skipping the US.\n\nDisney is facing some \"international visitation headwinds\" at its parks in the US, which include Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California, the Walt Disney Company said in its first-quarter earnings report on Monday.\n\nDespite the slowdown in international visitors, the company reported growth in its experiences segment, with visitation at its domestic parks up 1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nHugh Johnston, Disney CFO, told analysts on a call that the company has less visibility into international visitor trends than domestic because foreign travelers tend to stay in non-Disney hotels, but that there were other indicators international visitation was down.\n\n\"As a result of that, we pivoted our marketing and sales efforts, promotional as well as marketing efforts to a more domestic audience, and we're able to keep attendance rates high from that perspective,\" he said.\n\nDisney's just the latest American company to feel the slowdown in foreigners traveling to the US.\n\nInternational visitation was down for the eighth straight month in December, according to data from the National Travel and Tourism Office. As of October, the number of international visitors to the US was down 5.5% in 2025 compared to a year prior.\n\nAmir Eylon, president and CEO of Longwoods International, a market research consultancy that specializes in the travel tourism industry, said visits from Canada especially declined, but that there were also significant declines in visits from countries like Germany, France, and India.\n\nCanadian visits to the US were down 22% year-to-date as of October compared to a year prior, according to NTTO data.\n\n\"We have an image problem right now with our Canadian neighbors to the North and, as evidenced with some other countries, we have an image problem in some of our key international feeder markets as well,\" Eylon told Business Insider.\n\nHis firm's research has found a majority of Canadians say American trade policies and political rhetoric are deterring them from visiting the US in the next 12 months. Many also say they do not feel like the US is a safe place to visit.\n\nCanadians also typically make up a significant portion of international travel to Florida, so Eylon said Disney likely isn't the only destination in the Sunshine State feeling the slowdown.\n\nTravelers seeking to avoid the US also have other options when it comes to experiencing Disney. Disneyland Paris is fully owned by the Walt Disney Company, while the company has minority ownership in the Disney resorts in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Disney has no ownership in Tokyo Disneyland, which operates under a licensing agreement.\n\nDisney also benefited from consistent demand in domestic leisure travel, with Americans continuing to prioritize travel, Eylon said.\n\nAnna Abelson, an adjunct professor at New York University's Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality, said the slowdown in international visitors to Disney underscored a broader industry shift.\n\n\"Even 'bucket list' icons are navigating significant macroeconomic volatility, ranging from currency fluctuations to shifting geopolitical sentiments,\" Abelson told Business Insider.\n\nHave a story to share about travel to the US?

    "description": "Disney on Monday revealed the impact of its carriage dispute with YouTube TV that left customers unable to access ESPN, among other channels.",
    "fullText": "Disney is counting the cost of its prolonged dust-up with YouTubeTV this past November.\n\nThe Mouse House said Monday that the carriage dispute, which saw Disney-owned channels, including ESPN, unavailable to watch on YouTube TV for 15 days, caused an approximately $110 million operating income hit to its sports segment in its most recent fiscal quarter.\n\nOverall operating income for its sports division came in at $191 million, down 23% from the year-ago quarter, the company said. The company said this reflected the YouTube TV fallout, higher programming and production costs, and a decrease in subscription and affiliate fees.\n\nThe showdown centered on a dispute over how much the Google-owned TV service was prepared to pay to carry ABC, ESPN, and Disney's other TV networks.\n\nDisney claimed YouTubeTV wasn't assigning a fair value to its content, including its highly valuable sports rights, such as \"Monday Night Football\" and college football. YouTube argued that paying higher rates would force it to raise prices for its own customers. (Google gave YouTube TV subscribers a $20 bill credit as the fight dragged on.)\n\nThe high-profile skirmish was the longest blackout in Disney's history.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley had estimated that Disney was losing $30 million in revenue a week, or about $4.3 million each day, from the YouTubeTV standoff. Disney's disclosure, which concerned bottom-line operating income and not topline revenue, suggested the impact was deeper.\n\nIn its earnings, Disney also disclosed that it had generated record streaming profits for the quarter, boosted by recent price increases. Overall, the company beat Wall Street expectations for both revenue and profit in the quarter.\n\nDisney's stock was down about 2% in premarket trading. The company warned it was only expecting \"modest\" profit growth in its parks business in the second quarter, due to a combination of factors, including \"international visitation headwinds\" at its US parks.\n\nThe US tourism industry has taken a blow in recent months amid trade frictions and geopolitical tensions. Visits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, per the National Travel and Tourism Office.",

    "fullText": "Disney's price increases are working like magic.\n\nThe Mouse House's streaming business enjoyed record profits in the quarter ending December 27, the company reported on Monday.\n\nDisney+ and Hulu generated $450 million in operating income last quarter, up 72% from a year earlier, and far above the $352 million it brought in during the prior quarter. That beat Morgan Stanley's estimate of $444 million for Disney's direct-to-consumer business.\n\nDisney's streaming revenue rose 11% to $5.3 billion last quarter. Higher subscription fees drove the lion's share of that increase, growing 13%. Streaming revenue from other sources — including advertising — ticked up by 4%. For the first time, Disney didn't share its streaming subscriber count or growth.\n\nPrice hikes are Disney's not-so-secret pixie dust, as the company has raised prices for Disney+, Hulu, or both in each of the past five years, most recently in October. The ad versions of both Disney+ and Hulu rose $2 to $11.99 a month, while the ad-free version of Disney+ jumped to $18.99, matching the cost of ad-free Hulu.\n\nIt's a similar story in Disney's experiences division: the company posted record profits last quarter after raising prices in its parks for the fourth straight year.\n\nIt's not all a fairy tale, however. Viewership growth for Disney's streaming services hasn't kept pace with its subscriber gains or price hikes. Disney's viewership share has barely grown in the US in the past four years, according to Nielsen data based on TV watch time.\n\nDisney has several ideas for improving engagement on its streaming platforms, including AI-generated content, short-form video, and a new homepage.\n\nAlthough Disney slightly beat Wall Street's overall revenue and earnings estimates, its stock slipped about 2% in premarket trading as the company disclosed some weakness in its parks business among international guests.",

    "description": "Under Josh D'Amaro, Disney's experiences business has carried the company's profits. It shows why he's considered a top CEO contender.",
    "fullText": "Josh D'Amaro appears to be the frontrunner in the race to be Disney's next CEO, and the Mouse House's latest quarterly earnings showed why.\n\nDisney's experiences business, which D'Amaro oversees, is the backbone of a company that's being weighed down by the struggling pay-TV business and isn't yet lifted up by its streaming profits. And when that part of the business sneezes, the stock catches a cold.\n\nAlthough the unit generated record profits, and Disney overall slightly beat Wall Street estimates on both revenue and earnings, the stock fell about 5% in early trading.\n\nInvestors seemed worried about Disney's reference to \"international visitation headwinds\" at its US parks. Other possible factors driving down the stock were Disney's year-over-year decline in earnings per share and its lukewarm second-quarter guidance.\n\nBoth the record experiences profits and the investor concerns underscore just how important D'Amaro and his fiefdom are to the company.\n\nBloomberg reported on Monday that Disney's board of directors \"is aligning on promoting\" D'Amaro to replace longtime CEO Bob Iger, who's planning to retire later this year. Business Insider could not independently confirm the reporting. Disney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nUsers on the prediction market Kalshi assigned Josh D'Amaro a 92% chance of becoming the next CEO as of Monday morning.\n\nDana Walden, who runs Disney's entertainment and TV businesses, is widely seen to be the other top contender for the coveted CEO job. Walden has grown the streaming unit, which also turned in record profits in the last quarter. It's crucial to Disney's future, since traditional TV networks are losing their value due to continued cord-cutting.\n\nStill, D'Amaro's division is the profit-generating machine. Disney's parks, cruises, and products accounted for more than 70% of its operating income, despite making up a relatively small slice of its revenue at under 39%. Jason Bazinet, a media analyst at Citi, said Monday on CNBC that almost all of Disney's earnings underperformance last quarter came from the entertainment segment.\n\nBazinet added that \"virtually everyone\" on the buy side that he's spoken to \"would prefer that Mr. D'Amaro is named the new CEO.\"\n\n\"Nothing against Ms. Walden, but people just like Mr. D'Amaro a bit more,\" he said.\n\nD'Amaro's experiences segment has pulled off an impressive feat: consistently reeling in record revenue and hefty profits by making more money from each visitor, without alienating its biggest fans. The Mouse House has raised ticket prices for its US parks in each of the past four years.\n\nDisney said per-person spending at its US parks rose 4% last quarter, though attendance only increased by 1%, due in part to a dip in visits from international guests. That means the company is making more per customer, in part by upselling through Lightning Lane fast passes. While Disney could risk losing lower-income or middle-class visitors if it keeps hiking prices, its results suggest that's not an issue yet.\n\nOn Disney's earnings call, one analyst remarked on how the parks business had gone from the worst part of the company's portfolio to its profit engine.\n\nIger responded that he's \"very, very bullish\" on the parks business, which has \"never been more broad or more diverse.\"\n\n\"We have a healthy competition now at our company, in terms of which of those two businesses is going to essentially prevail as the No. 1 driver of profitability for the company,\" Iger said, in reference to the experiences and entertainment businesses — though he could also have been slyly nodding at the race between Walden and D'Amaro.",

As Disney himself put it: \"When people walk into the park, they don't want to think about trash cans. But they do want a clean park. Our job is to solve problems they didn't even know they had.\"",
    "fullText": "In the early planning stages of Disneyland, Walt Disney employed an unconventional research method that would forever change the way theme parks approach waste management. Instead of relying on assumptions, he went straight to the \n\nWalt Disney was known for his meticulous attention to detail, but perhaps less known is his dedication to understanding customer behavior. Before opening Disneyland in 1955, he spent countless hours visiting other amusement parks, not just to study their attractions, but to observe how people interacted with their environment.\n\n\"I've been to amusement parks all over the world,\" Disney once remarked, \"and I've seen what works and what doesn't. But more importantly, I've watched how people behave in these parks – that's where the real lessons are.\"\n\nDuring his research, Disney made a crucial observation about human behavior regarding trash disposal. He noticed a consistent pattern: visitors would carry their garbage for approximately 30 steps before giving up and dropping it on the ground. This wasn't a reflection of bad manners – it was simply human nature when proper disposal options weren't readily available.\n\n\"People won't walk more than 30 steps to put garbage in a container,\" Disney explained to his design team. \"And if they don't see a receptacle within that distance, they'll just drop it wherever they are.\"\n\nThis insight led to one of Disneyland's most fundamental design principles: the \"30-Step Rule.\" Disney mandated that trash cans be placed no more than 30 steps apart throughout the park. He personally supervised the placement of each container, often pacing out the steps himself to ensure optimal positioning.\n\nVan France, one of Disney's original team members, recalled: \"Walt would walk through the park with a hot dog, taking bite after bite, counting the steps until he needed to dispose of the wrapper. He was constantly thinking about the guest experience, down to the smallest detail.\"\n\nToday, decades after Walt Disney's original research, this principle remains a cornerstone of Disney parks worldwide. Visitors can still find a trash receptacle within 30 steps of wherever they stand – a testament to the enduring value of Walt's customer research. Modern Disney parks maintain over 1,000 trash cans per location, with Magic Kingdom alone housing over 2,000 receptacles.\n\nThe trash can study wasn't Disney's only foray into customer research. His commitment to understanding visitor behavior led to several other revolutionary park features:\n\n\"You don't build it for yourself,\" Disney often said. \"You know what people want and you build it for them.\"\n\nThe 30-step rule has influenced public space design well beyond theme parks. Modern urban planners and retail designers frequently cite Disney's research when placing waste receptacles in:\n\nAs Dick Nunis, former Chairman of Walt Disney Attractions, noted: \"Walt's genius wasn't just in creating entertainment – it was in understanding human nature and designing around it.\"\n\nThe 30-step rule demonstrates how foundational research can create lasting solutions. As Disney himself put it: \"When people walk into the park, they don't want to think about trash cans. But they do want a clean park. Our job is to solve problems they didn't even know they had.\"\n\nWhat started as a simple observation became a powerful example of how customer research, when done right, can create solutions that stand the test of time. Walt Disney's approach to the trash can problem wasn't just about keeping the park clean – it was about understanding human nature and designing around it, a principle that continues to influence customer-centric design across industries today.",

    "fullText": "From rhino-sized Rhyhorns to worm-like Diglett, visitors to PokéPark Kanto will roam a forest populated by lifelike Pokémon statues when the attraction opens next week\n\nIn Japan, February is normally a period of quiet reflection, a month defined by winter festivals in Sapporo’s snowy mountains and staving off the cold in steaming hot springs. Traditionally, international tourists start to arrive with the blossoms in spring – but thanks to the opening of Pokémon’s first ever amusement park on 5 February, this year, they are likely to come earlier.\n\nUnlike the rollercoaster-filled thrills of Tokyo Disney Sea or Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, PokéPark Kanto is essentially a forest populated by models of the creatures from the perennially popular games. Nestled in the quiet Tokyo suburb of Inagi, half an hour from the city centre, the park is a walkable forest with more than 600 Pokémonin it. Where the Mario-themed Super Nintendo World slots neatly into the massive Universal Studios Japan, PokéPark Kanto is hidden in the back of the less glitzy, funfair-esque Japanese theme park Yomiuri Land.\n\nTaking up 26,000 sq metres, the family-friendly attraction is divided into two main areas: Pokémon Forest and the plaza-esque Sedge Town. Tickets for the park are bought via a lottery system – and currently sold out for the next three months – ranging between ¥7,900 (£38) for a standard adult ticket and ¥14,000 (£66) for a queue-skipping priority pass.\n\nThe park’s creative direction has been overseen by one of the original Pokémon creators, Junichi Masuda. Visitors roam a series of explorable habitats, littered with endearingly lifelike statues of hundreds of Pokémon, arranged in fun tableaus where various species are interacting with each other. Walking through PokéPark Kanto feels akin to becoming a Pokédex-clutching David Attenborough, a re-creation of what it would be like to observe these fantastical creatures in the wild. Beaver-esque Bidoofs use their two front teeth to cut down a real tree. Worm-like Diglett burrow above the soil to greet a smiling Eevee.\n\nEach Pokémon is presented in full scale too, making the larger creatures especially awe-inspiring. From a lorry-sized re-creation of the rocky behemoth Onix to a herd of rhinoceros-sized Rhyhorns lining the main path, each habitat is a joy to behold, with hidden creatures dotted throughout the trees and grass as a reward for eagle-eyed kids.\n\nIn many ways, it’s surprising it has taken this long for a permanent Pokémon theme park to be erected. With Pikachu and pals celebrating their 30th anniversary this year, Pokémon is still comfortably the highest-grossing media brand in the world: its total estimated lifetime revenue of $150bn comfortably surpasses Disney properties such as Star Wars and Marvel. The Pokémon company’s profit rose to ¥70.3bn in the year ending February 2025 – roughly £337m – and with a range of new games, merchandise and the new theme park, its profits in 2026 are only likely to increase.\n\nAfter clearing the Pokémon forest, visitors are greeted by a Pokémon parade in Sedge Town square, where there are also Pokémon-themed versions of fairground games such as ring toss, Pokémon-themed food, and an Eevee-themed carousel. Visitors can also walk into a real-life Pokémon Centre (an iconic building from the games and anime) and grab a seat at a gym where they can watch a live Pokémon battle that blends human performers with cutting-edge animatronics.\n\nThe Pokémon Company has numerous Pokémon Centre shops all over Japan selling exclusive merchandise. PokéPark Kanto will continue this lucrative trend, selling plushies and clothing that people will have to travel there to own. Video games are huge business in Japan, one of the country’s main cultural exports – but theme parks based on the country’s virtual stars are a newer phenomenon. Since Super Nintendo World first opened its doors at Universal Studios Japan in 2021, it has been transplanted to Universal’s parks in Hollywood and Florida, with all locations helping to drive multi-billion dollar quarterly revenues.\n\nThanks to a weak yen post-pandemic, recent years have seen tourists flock to Japan. While it has been a boon to the economy, the flood of incomers has led to tension. From phone-camera-weilding influencers behaving badly, to overcrowded streets inconveniencing locals, the 42 million visitors who arrived in Japan in 2025 have come alongside a notable nationwide rise in anti-foreigner sentiment. Newly appointed prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is already doubling down on anti-tourist legislation. It’s safe to say that PokéPark Kanto, with its family-friendly international appeal, will only increase visitors to Japan’s overcrowded capital.",

    "description": "As a Disney travel planner who's visited the theme parks many times, here are the mistakes I always see people make that cost them time and money.",
    "fullText": "I've been to the Disney parks over 50 times, so I've truly done it all.\n\nI'm also a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels who specializes in Disney destinations, so a big part of my job is making recommendations about how to plan an epic trip. I also give my clients a lot of advice on what not to do.\n\nHere are some of the biggest mistakes people make at Disney World.\n\nIf you have any flexibility, avoid scheduling your Disney vacation during major school breaks in the US.\n\nHoliday weekends, spring break, and winter holidays will almost always bring the biggest crowds to the theme parks.\n\nDisney doesn't really have many low seasons anymore, but avoiding these highly popular times will give you more freedom to explore the parks with fewer crowds and lower ticket prices.\n\nThe theme parks are a big part of the Disney experience, and I love spending time at them. However, there's so much more to do in the area.\n\nFor one, I recommend taking a day off to lounge by your hotel's pool, resort hop, shop at Disney Springs, or even play a round of mini-golf.\n\nWhen we go to the parks, my family also usually takes a midday break to rest and relax. It is supposed to be a vacation, after all.\n\nSpeaking of just how much there is to do at Disney beyond the parks, you must check out its shopping, dining, and entertainment complex Disney Springs. It's free to explore.\n\nPick up some souvenirs at the massive World of Disney shop, check out the hundreds of sets and amazing displays at the Lego store, or just enjoy some snacks while you bask in the Florida sun.\n\nIf you get really hungry, head over to grab a delicious lunch at one of my favorite eateries, like Homecomin' or Frontera Cocina.\n\nMy No. 1 tip for visiting theme parks of any kind is to arrive early.\n\nYou'll get a huge jump on your day if you get to the parks as soon as they open, or just before. Crowd levels tend to be much lower at this time, meaning you can experience many attractions early in the day.\n\nAs with most theme parks, the longer you stay, the lower your daily ticket and accommodation costs are likely to be with bundles.\n\nIf you're already paying to travel to Disney, do yourself a favor and stay a few extra days.\n\nAfter all, the biggest complaint I get from clients is that they didn't stay long enough. In my opinion, a week is the ideal amount of time to truly experience Disney World.\n\nSome organization and prep are required for the ideal Disney World trip, but you shouldn't overplan.\n\nYou don't need to schedule every moment of your day or have every detail organized. Make a general outline of your daily agenda — with dining reservations and a list of must-do rides and attractions — but leave room for spontaneous fun.\n\nIf you're on too tight a schedule, you'll miss all the good stuff, like unique character interactions.\n\nThe park-hopping ticket option allows you to visit more than one park per day for less than it'd cost to buy each ticket separately.\n\nHowever, unless you're staying for only a very short time and want to see as much as possible, there are few reasons to park hop with small kids.\n\nIt can just become an unnecessary added expense that you probably won't make the best use of if you're pausing for afternoon naps or breaks.\n\nHowever, groups with older children or only adults may enjoy and fully take advantage of the flexibility that park hopping offers.\n\nIf you want to dine at table-service restaurants, you should make reservations in advance. However, eating three sit-down meals a day at Disney World will take up way too much of your time.\n\nMany table-service experiences can take 90 minutes to two hours from start to finish, so you wouldn't be left with much time to experience the rest of the parks.\n\nOne table-service reservation a day is usually a perfect respite from the hustle and bustle without overcrowding your schedule.\n\nRider swap, or rider switch, is a great service when traveling with young children who aren't tall enough for or don't want to ride certain attractions.\n\nIt allows one parent or guardian to wait with the child while the rest of the party rides. Once the first group returns, the waiting adult can go on the attraction without having to get in the back of the line.\n\nHowever, not enough people know about it, and they can end up wasting time in lines.\n\nJust get in the habit of asking the park employee at the front of the ride whether it's available for a particular attraction.\n\nStaying off the property can save you money, and I've done so many times on Disney trips. However, if you've never stayed at a Disney resort, you're missing out.\n\nThese stays can come with practical benefits, including complimentary transportation to and from the parks. The biggest perk, though, is the access to extra Disney magic.\n\nThese resorts typically have incredibly immersive themes and special touches that should be experienced at least once. Though there are some extravagant Disney resorts, there are also value ones that tend to be more budget-friendly.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 9, 2021, and most recently updated on January 27, 2026.",

    "description": "The My Disney Experience app has become essential for trips to Disney World and Disneyland, but relying on phones at the parks may not be so bad.",
    "fullText": "Every December, I take my family to Disneyland.\n\nOn our most recent annual trip, we snagged some great dinner reservations and checked into our themed hotel with ease. This time, my granddaughter was finally tall enough to ride more attractions, like Space Mountain and Tiana's Bayou Adventure.\n\nSoon, though, I realized something: Although our group had never had so much fun at Disney, we'd also never spent so much time on our phones.\n\nOur increased screen time wasn't due to texting or surfing the web — we were just managing our entire vacation on the My Disney Experience app.\n\nThough early versions of the app began making rounds in 2012, I didn't try it until a trip to Disney World in 2018.\n\nWhen checking into our hotel on the property, I'd turned down the chance to have our park tickets and room key loaded onto the app because I consider myself pretty old school.\n\nHowever, I finally caved by lunchtime.\n\nWhile at Animal Kingdom's Flame Tree Barbecue, I noticed several people just walking up to the counter and being handed food without ever waiting in the long line I'd been standing in.\n\nThat's when my wife told me about mobile ordering, a new service Disney had rolled out just a few months prior. I was hungry, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nIn a few taps, I'd placed our lunch order. The app asked if I was in the area and ready to pick up the food. I answered yes.\n\nWithin minutes, I got another alert saying my food was ready. I casually walked past the throngs of guests still waiting to even place their orders and picked up my pulled-pork sandwich.\n\nI felt like I'd been granted membership to a secret club.\n\nMy so-called \"secret\" club didn't last, as the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a new way of life, one where contactless interactions were preferred.\n\nMobile ordering, both at Disney and other institutions, has become the norm and, in some cases, the default or only option. Contactless check-in via a mobile app also became increasingly popular across various hotel chains, including Disney properties.\n\nDisney's app has since become a hub for park tickets, room keys, dinner reservations — and even line-skipping features.\n\nThere are still paper maps, physical tickets, and room key cards available for those who want them, but now, it feels difficult to imagine a trip to the parks without a smartphone loaded with the My Disney Experience app.\n\nThough I was once hesitant to use an app as my key card at a Disney hotel, it just made sense during our December trip.\n\nMy hotel reservation was linked to the other guests in my party, so they could easily unlock our suite and make room charges using the app. The only time we went to the front desk was to get a key card for our granddaughter because she likes to open the door herself.\n\nWhen it came time to enter the park, we scanned our tickets in the app and used our phones for entry. The app helped us check ride wait times so we could maximize our day. We also used it to peruse the menus of restaurants we might want to dine at, make reservations, and then receive alerts when our table was ready.\n\nOur biggest use of the app was reserving rides with the Lightning Lane, a service we'd paid extra for so we could skip the lines on popular attractions.\n\nEvery time we got off one ride, my wife was on the app, refreshing to check availability while trying to make the next reservation for our whole family.\n\nThough she did miss a few conversations while heads-down on her phone, it felt like a small sacrifice to make in order to efficiently secure seats on popular attractions for our whole family.\n\nWith everything we could need in this app, all we really had to do was make sure we had an extra battery and phone chargers in our bags.\n\nWalking around the park, I thought I'd feel sad seeing empty alcoves where machines once dispensed paper Fast Passes or the ticket booths in the process of being removed.\n\nHowever, I realized I really just feel nostalgic. Any wistful reflections would be a bit romanticized since the past may be simpler, but it wasn't always better.\n\nWhen my wife and I visited Disney World for the first time in the '80s, we picked up our park tickets from our travel agent, flew with physical boarding passes, and carried printed-out copies of our hotel reservations and rental-car agreement.\n\nTimes have definitely changed, but it sure is more convenient to travel with a digital boarding pass and the Disney app loaded on my phone instead of carrying a bunch of papers.\n\nAnd by not waiting in lines to order food or check in at a hotel, maybe parkgoers can free up their time to spend more of it having fun with family.\n\nBut if your face is buried in your phone, you're going to miss a lot — whether the special menu recommendations that come with placing a food order with a cashier or the look on a loved one's face as they get off a great ride.\n\nUltimately, the ability to manage your entire Disney trip on an app isn't exactly a bad thing — it just comes down to how you use it.",

    "description": "Star Wars has new leaders as Lucasfilm chief Kathleen Kennedy steps down. Analysts shared their thoughts on how Disney should manage the franchise.",
    "fullText": "Star Wars is getting two new masters who face a Jedi-caliber test: reviving an iconic film franchise.\n\nLucasfilm chief Kathleen Kennedy is stepping down after over 13 years and will be replaced by incoming co-presidents Dave Filoni and Lynwen Brennan. Filoni is currently Lucasfilm's chief creative officer, while Brennan brings business acumen as Lucasfilm's general manager.\n\nStar Wars is one of Hollywood's most valuable franchises, generating billions of dollars for Disney during Kennedy's tenure. That includes \"The Force Awakens\" in 2015, which is the highest-grossing film ever in the US.\n\nThat said, Filoni and Brennan are inheriting challenges. Disney hasn't made a Star Wars movie since 2019, in part due to a slew of announced films that never got finished. The franchise's output on Disney+ has included huge hits like \"The Mandalorian\" and \"Andor,\" as well as several misfires that failed to satisfy critics or audiences.\n\n\"Kathleen Kennedy oversaw both massive industry-altering successes that other studios would kill for, and question-raising disappointments,\" said Brandon Katz, the content strategy director at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics.\n\nFiloni and Brennan must balance pleasing longtime Star Wars lovers and growing the fan base, all while generating enough money for Disney without diluting the Star Wars brand.\n\nLucasfilm should trim its output of Star Wars TV shows to keep its brand from getting \"watered down,\" said Scott Mendelson, the box-office analyst at Puck.\n\nHe said Filoni and Brennan should learn from Marvel's mistakes. After Marvel enjoyed one of the greatest theatrical runs ever in the 2010s, Disney greenlit a wave of Marvel shows for Disney+ as it launched. \"Superhero fatigue\" became a buzzword in the industry, and even well-received films like \"Thunderbolts*\" struggled to break out at the box office. The movie theater business as a whole has lagged since the pandemic, which didn't help.\n\n\"Disney gets the idea that for some of these franchises, absence makes the heart grow fonder,\" Mendelson said. Disney should balance a slimmed-down Star Wars TV slate with a few movies that feel like must-see events, he added.\n\nThere are signs that fans are primed for a new Star Wars movie after a long wait. The limited 20th anniversary release of \"Revenge of the Sith\" was a hit last spring, and Lucasfilm's 2026 release, \"The Mandalorian and Grogu,\" ranks in the top 10 of 45 forthcoming films in key metrics like awareness, theatrical intent, and willingness to pay, according to Greenlight Analytics.\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, a box-office analyst at Comscore, said another pitfall Filoni and Brennan should avoid is the temptation to think too much with an eye toward commerce.\n\n\"The commoditization of Star Wars seeped into the creative,\" he said.\n\nSome Star Wars fans are thrilled with Lucasfilm's leadership change, especially the elevation of its creative chief.\n\n\"Dave Filoni is largely considered to be the understudy of George Lucas,\" said Stephen Kent, a Star Wars YouTuber and book author.\n\nStar Wars fans can be hard to please, but they seem optimistic about Filoni's ascension, said Shawn Robbins, a box-office analyst who's the director of analytics at Fandango.\n\nFiloni can bring Star Wars \"to a new generation of fans for them to praise, debate, and often both,\" Robbins said.\n\nStar Wars fan Lucas Lozano said that while Kennedy's legacy isn't flawless, he will remember her tenure well. The San Antonio-based Disney and Star Wars aficionado said he doesn't think \"anything anyone would've done would satisfy\" his fellow fans.\n\n\"There's always going to be flops and mishaps,\" Lozano said. \"As long as the hits make up for them, you can't argue with that.\"",

    "description": "Disney's stock is lagging despite CEO Bob Iger's comeback tour. Analysts broke down the reasons and the potential impact his successor could have.",
    "fullText": "Why has the market fallen out of love with Disney?\n\nBob Iger is nearing the end of a multi-year comeback run as CEO and has overseen several key improvements to Disney's business. Streaming has stopped bleeding cash. The company has mapped out a major expansion pipeline for parks and experiences. ESPN is bolstering its streaming strategy as the pay-TV bundle continues to shrink.\n\nDespite this, the stock is sitting about 43% below its 2021 peak — and it could leave a dent in Iger's legacy.\n\nDuring Iger's 15-year first run as CEO, which ended in 2020, Disney's stock surged as he transformed the company through acquisitions — Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm — that powered its movies, TV shows, consumer products, and parks. The introduction of the streaming service Disney+ in 2019 set off a growth narrative that saw the stock reach its all-time high of $198.60 in March 2021.\n\nSince then, Disney has fallen well behind the S&P 500. Disney is trading around $114 — up about 24% from the start of Iger's second term as CEO. By comparison, the S&P has gained around 75%.\n\n\"Disney was the one stock in media that you could compare to everyone else,\" longtime Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said, referring to the broader market. \"This is the lowest relative valuation it's had in more than 40 years.\"\n\nDisney is operating within a complicated environment for media giants during Iger's second run, which is reflected in the varied stock performance of its competitors. Disney has no exact peer, but shares of its biggest rival, the pure-play streamer Netflix, have gained nearly 206% since November 2022, when Iger returned to Disney. Warner Bros. Discovery — which includes a storied Hollywood studio and HBO — was lagging until takeover interest fueled a stock run. Its shares are up 165% in that time period. Shares of NBCUniversal owner Comcast, which is dealing with both a troubled cable business and a sub-scale streamer, have declined about 12%.\n\nDisney employees and everyday investors who spoke with Business Insider said they were frustrated by the stock's performance, but most believed it would eventually rebound.\n\n\"The fundamentals are there, and while the stock has lagged, it's part of a diversified portfolio, so I can afford to wait it out,\" said Dia Adams, a Disney fan and travel agent.\n\nSo, what's holding back the stock?\n\nWall Street analysts describe Disney as comprising three separate but interconnected businesses, each with its own distinct risk profile. At any given time, one of them looks shaky enough to hamper Disney's overall growth story.\n\nDisney's Entertainment division, which spans linear TV networks, streaming services, and studios, is the most complex piece. Revenue from Disney's traditional TV business continues to decline as viewers shift away from the medium. That was on full display in Disney's fiscal fourth quarter ending September 27, with linear operating income falling 21% year over year.\n\nThe streaming business has been a bright spot, with operating income up 39% year over year in the fourth quarter. However, skeptics are concerned about streaming's ability to replace linear TV's decline and point out that growth is increasingly coming from outside the US, where people are often more price-sensitive.\n\nThe streaming wars could also get tougher for Disney moving forward. Netflix and Paramount Skydance are in a bidding war over Warner Bros. Discovery, and whichever combination emerges will create a larger rival that could put pressure on Disney.\n\nThen there's Disney's studio business: hit-driven and expensive.\n\nWall Street was looking for Iger to work his magic on the movie business, and the films were \"horrific\" in Disney's 2025 fiscal year, Ehrlich said. The company blamed a decline in studio revenue on comparisons to the prior year's \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" and \"Inside Out 2.\" Things have been looking up, though, with the blockbuster performance of \"Zootopia 2\" at the box office.\n\nThe Experiences division encompasses theme parks and cruise ships, and has become a top driver of profit for Disney. The division's recent strength has relied heavily on price increases rather than a bump in attendance.\n\nThat raises a key question: How much pricing power does Disney have left?\n\nIn 2025, domestic park attendance decreased 1%, according to Disney's annual report. Disney has also faced concerns about competition in Florida from Comcast's recently opened Epic Universe, and about the delayed debut of Disney Adventure in Singapore, now scheduled for March.\n\nSports is the smallest segment of Disney's business by revenue, but it has a clear growth story.\n\nESPN is modernizing for streaming with a newly enhanced app and big direct-to-consumer ambitions. That said, the cost of sports rights is increasing, and competition is intensifying — not only from traditional rivals like Fox, but also from deep-pocketed tech companies such as YouTube and Amazon.\n\nDisney's sports spending was a topic on its latest earnings call after it paid more than a 73% increase for NBA rights in its latest deal, which kicked off with the 2025-2026 season. The company said the value to audiences and advertisers was big, even if the cost creates some \"bumpiness\" in financial results.\n\nWall Street sees no quick fix for Disney's stock. Analysts want proof of steady, repeatable earnings growth, whether from a stronger film slate, improved streaming profitability, or an expected lift from the cruise business in late 2026.\n\nThe stock price matters in ways that affect Disney operationally. Equity is critical to retaining top executives, and stagnant shares can dull the appeal of stock-based pay. This could complicate the job of Disney's next CEO.\n\nDisney's CEO succession has become a favorite parlor game, with chatter centering on Experiences chief Josh D'Amaro and Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden.\n\nRegardless of who is chosen, investors are hoping for steady leadership over reinvention. The desire for continuity limits Iger's ability to make sweeping changes in his final months.\n\n\"Typically, CEOs will try very hard to exit on a high note,\" said Laurent Yoon, US media and telecom analyst at Bernstein. \"For Iger, it's certainly not good. It's going to be difficult to get stock in a good direction, at least near term.\"",

    "description": "DramaBox, a top micro-drama app, is looking to raise fresh funding as the short-video format gains popularity.",
    "fullText": "The battle to become the top micro-drama app in the US is heating up.\n\nDramaBox, one of the leading producers of the short-video format filled with soapy tropes, has been seeking fresh funding from US backers, according to two people with direct knowledge of its efforts.\n\nOne said DramaBox's fundraising goal was $100 million with a $500 million valuation.\n\nDramaBox is part of Singapore-based StoryMatrix, and is behind titles like \"A Deal with the Hockey Captain\" and \"The Lost Heir: A Christmas Reckoning\" that it monetizes through one-off payments, subscriptions (usually $20 a week), and ads.\n\nDramaBox did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nExecutives at DramaBox told Business Insider in September that the company was profitable and that their ambition was to become the most popular micro-drama platform for Americans. They aimed to do so by working with Hollywood filmmakers and diversifying into new storytelling styles and genres, such as series for families and choose-your-own-adventure-style dramas.\n\nIndustry reports regularly list DramaBox as one of the top two micro-drama apps, alongside fellow Asian import ReelShort. Analytics firm Sensor Tower estimated that DramaBox generated $120 million in global in-app revenue in the first quarter of 2025, just behind ReelShort's $130 million. DramaBox countered in the September interview that its numbers were higher, without sharing specifics.\n\nThe streaming consulting firm Owl & Co. estimated that the format had generated $1.3 billion in the US in 2025, mostly from direct payments from viewers.\n\nDramaBox already has a connection to Hollywood's most blue-chip company, Disney, which has invested in DramaBox through its selective accelerator program. Disney said in late 2025 that it was in talks with DramaBox to adapt young adult fantasy novels into original micro dramas and was exploring adapting music albums into vertical short videos.\n\nInvestors have been placing bets elsewhere in the space as well:\n\nMeta's Instagram is testing the micro drama format in India with a series. TikTok, which is already widely used by short dramas for marketing, added a section called TikTok Minis where you can binge on bite-sized series without leaving the app.\n\nDespite the format's burgeoning popularity, there are those who question its long-term viability. Some investors told Business Insider they had held back from the space because of concerns that the format wouldn't succeed in areas beyond its core of female-targeted romances.",

    "description": "I took a cruise to Alaska on the Disney Wonder. From the excursions to the sightseeing on board, the trip was unforgettable and definitely worth it.",
    "fullText": "As a frequent traveler, I've sailed with several different cruise lines on itineraries throughout the Caribbean, Northern Europe, and the Mediterranean. But out of everywhere I've been, my favorite vacation was an eight-night sailing on board the Disney Wonder to Alaska.\n\nAs someone who loves to vacation in warm and relaxing places, I wasn't expecting my sailing to Alaska to top the list of my all-time favorite trips, but I loved the itinerary and was happy to swap my frozen drink for some hot cocoa.\n\nHere's why it was such a standout trip.\n\nAlthough I typically like to splurge on a room with a veranda on cruises, I was especially glad I did so on this trip. There wasn't any shortage of activities on board, but our favorite thing to do was grab our binoculars and sit out on our balcony.\n\nWe were able to see whales and porpoises swimming alongside the ship, as well as eagles flying above us and nestled in the trees alongside the shore — all from the comfort of our room.\n\nWe didn't end up booking any formal whale watching excursions, but we felt like we had seen so much wildlife on the cruise itself that we didn't regret passing on it.\n\nOur cruise offered a unique option on the day that we sailed to the Stikine Icecap: the chance to board a smaller boat to take you even closer to the glacier.\n\nThe excursion was pricey at about $300 per person, and I was unsure if it would be worth it. But given I wasn't sure when — or if — we'd ever be back in Alaska, I decided to risk it. I'm so glad I did because it ended up being the highlight of our trip.\n\nOur explorer boat got closer to the glacier than the ship, and we also got to cruise around the fjord for about three hours, giving us great views of misty waterfalls, eagles, and mountains.\n\nIt feels like almost everyone you talk to on a cruise has one non-negotiable shore excursion. For me, it was riding the White Pass Scenic Railway in Skagway.\n\nThe railroad was built during the Klondike Gold Rush over the course of two years and has been in operation since 1900.\n\nIt's a steep climb through the mountains, and the roughly three-hour ride offered amazing views from inside the train car, as well as the open-air viewing platforms between cars.\n\nThere are some things I think Disney Cruise Line excels at, like great food, amazing hospitality, and small touches that make a trip feel really special.\n\nAlthough every sailing I've had with Disney has been excellent, this one truly stood out for all of the extra touches. For example, there was always complimentary hot cocoa waiting for us upon returning from the port, or on deck during the glacier viewing. There were even stacks of fleece blankets in case we got too cold.\n\nPlus, for one day of the sailing, the Disney characters wear exclusive costumes only seen on board Alaska voyages.\n\nAlthough I've been on over a dozen cruises, I know I'll never forget my journey to Alaska.\n\nIt was so special to be able to hike next to a glacier, dig into a pile of king crab legs, and ride through mountain passages on a train. Plus, when we got back on the ship, we got to experience all the storytelling and special touches that Disney is known for.\n\nOverall, I really loved this itinerary and wouldn't hesitate to save up for another sailing in the future.",

    "title": "These 8 big deals defined the year in artificial intelligence",
    "description": "From Disney's $1 billion bet on OpenAI to a wave of blockbuster acquihires, these deals reshaped the tech industry in 2025.",
    "fullText": "While most of the industry was out of office over the holidays, Nvidia and SoftBank's deal teams were grinding.\n\nBoth companies chose the year's quietest stretch to drop news that was anything but: SoftBank said Monday it will acquire digital infrastructure investor DigitalBridge for about $4 billion.\n\nNvidia's move was stranger still. On Christmas Eve, it announced a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement\" with Groq, the startup behind custom chips designed to handle AI inference — the real-time work that powers chatbot replies. The companies did not disclose financial terms.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't call it an acquisition, the guts of the arrangement looked familiar. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, along with top engineering staff, will head to Nvidia. Groq, last valued at $6.9 billion in a funding round three months ago, will continue to operate independently.\n\nIt's the latest example of a new kind of tech dealmaking, where the founder and key engineers get bought out, the technology gets siphoned off, and the startup itself is left in limbo.\n\nThat's the vibe of 2025: big, hairy deals that refuse to stay inside the lines.\n\nThe industry's biggest moves weren't just splashy acquisitions or eye-watering funding rounds. (We saw those deals, too.) They were sprawling, hard-to-categorize transactions. Money came tied to compute. Licensing came paired with talent raids. Infrastructure deals locked governments and corporate America into yearslong dependencies. These weren't neat mergers or simple checks. They were power grabs that shifted the balance of Silicon Valley and beyond.\n\nThese were the eight deals that defined the year in AI, ranked from smallest to largest by dollar value.\n\nNvidia ended the year doing the same thing that turned heads all year: extracting founders from their startups and leaving other employees to figure it out.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Nvidia announced it had entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq. The financial terms were undisclosed.\n\nUnder the agreement, Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other team members, will join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of over $4.5 trillion.\n\nGroq will continue to operate as an independent company, with CFO Simon Edwards assuming the CEO role.\n\nDisney struck a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI in December, becoming the first major content partner for Sora, OpenAI's video generator.\n\nThe deal isn't just about rights. Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI and receive warrants to buy additional equity — a structure that ties content, distribution, and upside together.\n\nBusiness Insider reporter Lucia Moses argues the logic can be summed up in one word: engagement. Time spent on Disney+ and other major streaming services has remained essentially flat in recent years, she writes, while YouTube and social video continue to grow.\n\nThe OpenAI partnership could help Disney meet audiences where they already are, by allowing fans to use tools like ChatGPT and Sora to generate and remix content featuring Disney characters.\n\nDeveloper coding assistant Windsurf was a startup Cinderella story. Then it became a cautionary tale.\n\nThe company was in talks to sell to OpenAI for $3 billion this past spring. The deal fell apart at the last minute.\n\nGoogle emerged as a new suitor. Instead of an outright acquisition, Google said it would pay $2.4 billion to hire its CEO and top talent, as well as license the company's intellectual property.\n\nThe deal effectively split Windsurf into two pieces, with the hundreds of remaining employees ending up at Cognition, another AI coding startup. That left some with a bitter taste.\n\nPart of the social contract in startups is that early employees work long hours at lower pay in the hope that they will share in the riches should their startup eventually get acquired or go public.\n\nNow, traditional acquisitions have become rarer because of the time and uncertainty of getting regulatory approval. As a result, companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have been getting creative, using licensing deals to skirt regulators and snap up key talent.\n\nSoftBank snapped up a private equity firm with the ultimate goal of controlling more of the physical infrastructure behind AI.\n\nOn Monday, SoftBank said it has entered into an agreement to acquire DigitalBridge, an alternative asset manager that invests in data centers, cell towers, fiber networks, and power that make the AI boom possible.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe deal comes as SoftBank reshuffles its portfolio. In November, the company said it had sold nearly $6 billion of Nvidia stock to free up cash for OpenAI. SoftBank is also doubling down on \"physical AI,\" building a robotics beachhead with a dedicated investment arm and a pending deal to buy ABB's robotics business.\n\nThe Trump administration agreed to take a 9.9% stake in Intel in August. It was a rare moment when Washington wasn't just regulating an industry or subsidizing it, but buying into it.\n\nUnder the terms Intel disclosed, the government will invest $8.9 billion for 433.3 million shares, and the stake is to be passive, with no board seat.\n\nThe investment aims to bolster domestic capacity for designing and manufacturing advanced chips. Intel has seen foreign competitors, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, cut into its market share of advanced chips. The White House has said it is a national security risk if industries continue to import the vast majority of advanced chips from overseas.\n\nThis also likely won't be the last deal of its kind. President Donald Trump and top aides have floated the idea of doing similar deals with American defense contractors and have considered a sovereign wealth fund.\n\nOne of the year's biggest deals sparked the question: Was Meta really spending $14 billion to hire a 28-year-old?\n\nAlexandr Wang cofounded and ran Scale AI, the data-labeling company that helps enterprises train and deploy AI models by supplying high-quality training data and tooling. In June, Meta agreed to pay $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI — and, just as importantly, to bring Wang in to lead its next act in AI.\n\nWang became Meta's chief AI officer and the public face of its superintelligence push, with a mandate that goes well beyond building better chatbots. His job is to convince elite researchers that Meta is the place to do their life's work — and to turn the company's key advantage, its compute budget, into a lasting edge.\n\nWhen Google agreed to buy Israeli-American cloud security firm Wiz earlier this year, it threw a $32 billion bucket of water on the idea that the mega-deal drought would persist.\n\nIn March, Google agreed to acquire the startup at an all-cash price roughly equal to Iceland's gross domestic product last year, pending regulatory sign-off. This marks the search giant's largest acquisition.\n\nThe acquisition served as an early litmus test of the Trump administration's willingness to greenlight pricey Big Tech mergers and acquisitions. The deal passed an antitrust review by the Department of Justice in November, clearing a key hurdle to closing.\n\nTrump kicked off his second term by unveiling a joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build a chain of data centers across the US — a project called Stargate that aims to invest $500 billion in domestic infrastructure by 2029.\n\nIn Abilene, Texas, a flagship data center has already opened. Construction crews have broken ground on Stargate sites in Lordstown, Ohio, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, with several more campuses to come.\n\nTo make the ongoing buildout a success, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has estimated it could take one-fifth of the nation's existing skilled trade workforce.",

    "title": "8 things to pack for a Disney vacation and 3 to leave behind, from a travel planner who's visited the parks over 40 times",
    "description": "As a frequent Disney World visitor and travel planner, there are things I always pack to survive park days, such as ponchos, plus some I never bring.",
    "fullText": "After going to Disney World over 40 times, I've gotten really good at visiting the parks — especially when it comes to optimizing the space in my suitcase.\n\nI'm also a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels specializing in Disney destinations, so my clients often ask me about the most important items to pack for a trip to the parks.\n\nRead on for the essentials I always bring, as well as the things I think you can leave at home.\n\nIf you've spent any time in the Orlando area, you know it will likely rain during your Disney trip.\n\nDon't let that stop you from having fun — just throw on rain ponchos and hit the parks. It's often much cheaper to buy them before you leave rather than inside Disney World.\n\nYou can also wear ponchos if you don't want to get wet on rides like Splash Mountain and Kali River Rapids.\n\nI've tried out every kind of bag you can imagine when visiting the parks. Ultimately, my biggest advice is to bring something small that fits your main essentials.\n\nMy husband's favorite is a cross-body bag, and I love a small backpack, purse, or fanny pack.\n\nYou want something that's easy to take on and off quickly, compact enough to take on rides, and roomy enough that you're not cramming your phone and necessities in.\n\nWhen you head to the parks, you want to travel light, so I like having smaller versions of essentials to carry.\n\nI raid the travel section of my local store before every trip to make sure I have sunscreen, hand sanitizer, aloe-vera gel, sanitizing wipes, a mini first-aid kit, pain relievers, and tissues.\n\nIt's not a Disney trip without the quintessential Mickey or Minnie ears. At this point, I have plenty to choose from based on different seasons, holidays, and moods.\n\nI also pack some of my many Disney T-shirts — one for each day at the parks. We always get one special matching family shirt for each trip, as well.\n\nThis way, we can stay on theme without feeling tempted to spend money on more merchandise while in the parks.\n\nA lot of planning in the parks requires the use of the My Disney Experience app, which is crucial for tasks like checking maps or making dining reservations. Plus, we love snapping lots of photos.\n\nVisiting Disney involves a lot of walking — on many days in the parks, I log over 10 miles. Also, because of frequent rain and water rides, my shoes often get wet.\n\nSo, I bring comfortable, fast-drying shoes to ensure my experience isn't ruined by blisters or sore feet. My husband always wears his Keen sandals, and I switch between my Sanuks and Tevas.\n\nMy family has made it a tradition to send a letter or postcard to someone back home from inside the parks.\n\nYou can always bring souvenir postcards to the front desk of your resort. However, it's more fun to put it in one of the four mailboxes on Main Street USA at Magic Kingdom.\n\nYou can pay for almost everything at Disney World with Disney gift cards, including dining, merchandise, and resort charges.\n\nMany external retailers offer small discounts when you purchase these cards, so buying them ahead of time is a great way to save a little money on your vacation.\n\nTo curb excess spending, we give each of our kids a gift card at the beginning of the trip for souvenirs. Once they use up their card's balance, they're done spending.\n\nAside from Victoria and Albert's at the Grand Floridian Resort, none of the Disney dining locations really expect more than casual dress.\n\nI love this aspect of Disney World because it means there are wonderful dining options with upscale-feeling food that are still super family-friendly.\n\nMy husband and I usually throw one nicer casual outfit in our suitcase if we decide we want to get a little fancy. But, generally, our dress clothes get left in the closet at home.\n\nMy clients often ask me if they need to bring life jackets or towels for their children to enjoy the hotel pools. Fortunately, the answer is no.\n\nAll the Disney resorts provide these items, so you can save space in your suitcase and leave them at home.\n\nIt's nice to have a few quick snacks on hand in the hotel room or in your park bag, but don't waste space in your suitcase. You can have groceries delivered to your Disney resort.\n\nMost national delivery services are available, or Garden Grocer is a local option. These deliveries can be picked up in the lobby at no charge or sent straight to your room for a small fee.\n\nThis story was originally published in January 2022 and most recently updated on December 29, 2025.",

    "title": "Streamers like Disney+ and HBO Max have a key problem with no clear solution",
    "description": "Free streamers like YouTube have gained viewers, while growth at paid services like Disney+ and Netflix has slowed.",
    "fullText": "Free streaming services are having success, and it may be coming at the expense of their paid peers.\n\nYouTube and other free ad-supported services, such as The Roku Channel and Fox-owned Tubi, have become increasingly popular over the last two years, according to Nielsen's viewership data.\n\n\"For consumers, cost sensitivity is often a more important deciding factor than user experience,\" said Brandon Katz, a media analyst at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics. \"Saving money outweighs the annoyance of terrible insurance commercials.\"\n\nAs these free streamers eat up a larger chunk of viewership time on US smart TVs, they may be holding back the growth of services like Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max.\n\nFree-to-access services YouTube, Tubi, and The Roku Channel have grown their viewership by 53% from December 2023 through November, according to a Business Insider analysis of Nielsen data. Those three free streamers make up nearly 18% of all watch time on US TVs, and that doesn't include Paramount's Pluto TV, which Nielsen broke out individually until March.\n\nIn that span, major paid streamers' collective watch time is only up 5%. That includes Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, Peacock, and HBO Max, formerly known as Max. (Paramount+ was included until March, when Nielsen stopped reporting its individual share. And HBO Max's viewership includes sister streamer Discovery+.)\n\nThat means free streamers are growing more than 10 times faster than their paid counterparts, though the bulk of that growth is driven by YouTube, which has become a force in Hollywood.\n\nSlower engagement growth is a troubling sign for paid streamers. Viewership is positively tied to pricing power and inversely correlated with cancellations, meaning that people who watch a streamer more often are less likely to cancel.\n\n\"Engagement drives churn down,\" said Hernan Lopez, founder of media consulting firm Owl & Co.\n\n\"It's not just about hours spent,\" he added, but also the frequency that viewers return to an app and the breadth of content that they watch.\n\nEngaged streaming subscribers are also usually more receptive to price hikes, Katz said, since they likely place a higher value on the service than inactive users.\n\n\"The goal is to offer customers enough attractive content that opening the app becomes a regular occurrence,\" Katz said. \"At that habitual usage point, streamers are able to reasonably raise prices without fear of a mass exodus of customers.\"\n\nFor customers on ad-supported plans, higher engagement also translates to more ad revenue.\n\nIt's not all bad news for paid streamers. Streaming is an increasingly profitable business, thanks in large part to price hikes, which every major service (except for Prime Video) has implemented or announced in the past 12 months.\n\nDisney+, Hulu, and HBO Max have also continued to add customers this year. However, Peacock hasn't grown its subscriber base since the first quarter of 2025, and Netflix no longer reports its subscriber count on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe large gap between free and paid streamer viewership growth rates suggests that so-called stream-flation could be taking a toll. Media giants must walk a tightrope between pleasing Wall Street and pushing consumers toward free streamers, or apps like Instagram and TikTok.\n\nStreaming giants Netflix and Disney each have creative ideas for driving engagement in 2026.\n\nNetflix is turning to video podcasts in hopes of adding lean-back content that keeps subscribers engaged throughout the day. It's also been trying to use games as a way to create daily habits among its users.\n\nDisney is taking a different tack by betting on AI-generated video through a new partnership with OpenAI. This AI initiative will enable fans to create short clips of Disney characters, such as Mickey Mouse or Darth Vader, eventually within the Disney+ app.",

    "description": "Lee Wan Yu, a former Disneyland parade dancer, shares a behind-the-scenes look at the audition process and what she learned from Disney's magic.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lee Wan Yu, 30, a Hong Kong Disneyland parade dancer turned freelance dance artist, teacher, and choreographer. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started dancing when I was three years old, after asking my mom for ballet lessons as we walked past a studio.\n\nFrom then on, all I wanted to do was dance. That love eventually led me somewhere I, as an introvert, never expected: Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nIt started in 2017, when Hong Kong Disneyland held an audition at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore, where I was studying for my diploma in dance.\n\nI went with a friend who didn't want to go alone. I had no expectations and just wanted to see how a professional audition works.\n\nAbout 50 dancers from the region participated in the audition.\n\nThey gave us a short jazz combination and had us perform it in small groups, cutting dancers until about 20 of us were left. They took our photos, measured our height, and recorded our body measurements.\n\nMonths later, while I was studying for my fine arts degree in New York, I was offered a standard one-year contract as a parade dancer at Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nWhen I arrived in May 2018, I realized I was the only Singaporean parade dancer at the time. The team included dancers from Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, and Thailand.\n\nA typical day started around 11 a.m. We had a warm-up class, followed by makeup and costumes.\n\nWe typically performed two parades a day, one in the afternoon and one at night, for about 30 minutes each. During festive seasons like Christmas, we could have up to four parades a day.\n\nIn the middle of each parade, we would stop in front of the castle for a short \"show stop\" to interact with guests.\n\nRehearsals for the Halloween parades sometimes ended around 2 a.m. because they took place after the park closed for the night.\n\nThe Hong Kong heat can be terrible, and the night-parade costumes had lights wired through and batteries attached. You could feel the weight pressing on your shoulders.\n\nSometimes I felt homesick or lonely, but once you're in costume, you have to bring your full energy.\n\nWhen you step into Disneyland, you should feel like you're transported to a different world — a place where you can disconnect, forget your problems for a while, and just be happy.\n\nThis is why guests would never see dancers working out during breaks, because Disney wanted to keep the illusion. We were also not allowed to take any backstage photos or videos.\n\nThe magic is the reason some guests come to every parade. There were adults who followed the route, taking photos, and kids who waved at us every day. I remember a teenage boy who came almost every weekend, dancing beside the route the whole time.\n\nSome of them recognized us outside the park without our costumes. Others gave us prints of photos they had taken of us.\n\nIt was more than just branding and the experience.\n\nAt Hong Kong Disneyland, everyone, from the dancers to the sound crew, respected one another. Even when people were tired, they were still polite. That attitude really stuck with me.\n\nI learned that how I treat people — not just the audience, but also my colleagues, the costume team, and the stage managers — really affects how smoothly everything runs and whether people want to be around you.\n\nOn the other side, Disney valued its performers. It was very serious about safety and well-being. We had good medical insurance, which is important for dancers.\n\nAfter one year, I decided not to re-audition for contract renewal. I wanted to explore new challenges.\n\nI'm now a freelance dancer, teacher, and choreographer in Singapore, where I try to infuse Disney's spirit of \"magic\" into my work.\n\nDance training can be stressful for kids, especially during exams or competitions, so I try to keep that sense of fun alive and create an environment where my students feel safe and excited to learn.\n\nThe magic is about creating that little moment in class where someone feels proud or inspired.\n\nI also try to bring that same magic into my choreography. AI plays a small part in helping me express my ideas.\n\nAs a choreographer, I often have to write synopses for school performances or competitions, and that part is difficult because dancers think in movement, not in sentences.\n\nRecently, I started using ChatGPT to help organize my ideas. I don't let it write for me, but I use it to structure what I already have and express my thoughts more clearly.\n\nI'm also open to trying AI software for large-scale productions with apps that can help with pinpoint formations, map things out, and visualise spacing.\n\nOver the past two years, I was a choreographer for Singapore's National Day Parade performances, overseeing close to 600 students for one of them. I remember spending weeks figuring out formations by hand, staying up until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., moving people around in Excel.\n\nIf AI could help with that, it would save so much time.\n\nBut technology can only assist — the emotion behind the movement still has to come from people.",

    "description": "Iowa 80 in Walcott, Iowa stretches 150 football fields and serves 350,000 meals a year. It's more than just a stop on the road for truckers, though.",
    "fullText": "I've often driven past truckers feeling frustrated by their slow speed or uneasy that one might merge into my lane. I never gave much thought to who was behind the wheel.\n\nHowever, Iowa 80, the world's largest truck stop, cracked my heart open a bit.\n\nIowa 80's been dubbed the \"Disney World\" for truckers, but it's much more than its flashy signs, lines of semis, and large buffet. It's a home away from home for the people who move 70% — $13 trillion worth — of the goods Americans eat and buy.\n\nIowa 80 is a place where truckers can find some temporary peace, a shower, and even a dental exam. I was surprised to learn just how important a truck stop like this can be for people bound to the highways.\n\nIt sits along I-80 in Walcott, Iowa, and spans 225 acres. It has 900 parking spots, nine restaurants, 24 showers, and a massive chrome shop.\n\nIt's not in any world record books, though. After decades of folks saying, \"This has got to be the biggest truck stop in the world,\" the family behind Iowa 80 adopted the name. Now it's on dozens of signs around the property.\n\nIowa 80 is in a prime location, along one of America's busiest highways that connects New York City and Chicago to Des Moines and San Francisco. Plus, as the nation's top producer of corn and eggs, Iowa is a major agricultural shipping hub.\n\nWhat sets this truck stop apart, besides its size, is that it's one of the few mom-and-pop ones still around.\n\nOwned by the Moon family since 1964, Iowa 80 always has parking. Its main restaurant makes a surprising amount of food from scratch. It's a welcome change, truckers told me, from the big chains, like TA or Pilot, which often have full parking lots and fuel stations and only offer fast food to eat.\n\nI knew it was going to be big. But even I had underestimated the size. When I walked in, I thought, 'How on Earth am I going to see it all?'\n\nBig guys with their big gulps parted ways under the old-timey truck hanging over the entrance.\n\nWalking in, it felt like a shopping mall, complete with a food court filled with Orange Julius, Wendy's, and Taco Bell. On the right, the Iowa 80 Kitchen churned out homemade meals that were delicious.\n\nIt's no surprise they're working with a huge quantity of food. In their 61 years, they've gone through 23 million eggs. Bacon is one of the first things to hit the ovens each morning. The staff has to juggle both breakfast and lunch prep early to beat the rush.\n\nFor its size, I expected a lot of the food to be frozen. Indeed, the scrambled eggs and biscuits did arrive pre-cooked and frozen. However, most of the main dishes were cranked out by hand.\n\nChef Chris Han uses her grandfather's recipe for meatloaf, which includes chopped onions, celery, a tomato sauce mixture, breadcrumbs, and ground beef. She incorporates it all together in a 40-year-old mixer.\n\nThe cooks told me they tried to switch to pre-made ranch dressing, but there was an uproar among customers. So they went back to mixing it themselves. Mayo arrives in big buckets. That gets mixed with six gallons of buttermilk and nine packets of ranch seasoning.\n\nDiners have two options at Iowa 80 Kitchen. They can either pay for the buffet for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Or they can order off the expansive menu.\n\nThe Hungryman is a crowd favorite, with three kinds of meat, hash browns, eggs, and pancakes. When it hit my table, I couldn't believe people finish it.\n\nThese are sweet cream pancakes, which means they're made with heavy cream instead of milk or buttermilk. This swap felt like a brilliant indulgence to me.\n\nDespite sitting out for a bit while we took pictures, these pancakes had an incredible crisp on the outside. On the inside, they were still fluffy and almost gooey. I loved the unique tang to them.\n\nThis dish sang of Midwest comfort. I grew up a few hours south of Iowa 80, and it reminded me of my mom's recipe (I plead the fifth on which is better). It was warm, melty, and full of interesting textures, thanks to the breadcrumbs and celery.\n\nThe truckers I spoke to said that it's easy to get obese working as professional drivers. Most truck stops only have fast food options.\n\nThat's why Iowa 80 Kitchen means so much to them. It's a warm, home-cooked meal, they said. I wondered if that sentiment would excuse the few things that arrived frozen.\n\nLee Meier, granddaughter of the founders and the current marketing manager, took me on a tour of the massive truck stop. She explained that they wanted to include all these amenities — like 24 showers, a small gym, a laundry room, and a truck wash — so drivers wouldn't have to do errands in the precious hours they have at home with their families.\n\nWhen we poked our heads in around 2 p.m., there was no one in the 60-seat theatre. Disney's \"Cars\" played to an empty room.\n\nSeeing the movie selection gave me a jolt of excitement and nostalgia. It felt like I was a kid again, looking at that cool friend's massive collection of DVDs. I wanted more than anything to stay and cozy up to a movie.\n\nIt struck me that if a trucker has a toothache, they can't pull their rig into a neighborhood dentist. Which is why a dentist at a truck stop could be so valuable.\n\nI didn't get a chance to talk to the chiropractor, but Lee told me that many drivers experience back pain from being seated for 10 hours a day.\n\nTruckers can get new headlights, fenders, hood ornaments, seats, electronics, and horns. Iowa 80 also has a Truck Service Center that can repair any semi.\n\nAnd for drivers who might need inspiration for decorating their vehicle, there's even a trucking museum on the property, featuring over 100 antique rigs on display.\n\nDrivers told me that just to get some sleep, they have to fight for a parking spot at the most common truck stops, like TA and Pilot, but after 7 p.m. or 8 p.m., it's impossible to find one.\n\nThat's why you'll sometimes see rigs pulled over on the shoulder of a highway onramp to sleep, which can be unsafe if there's heavy traffic.\n\nEven with hundreds of trucks settled in by the time we left at 5 p.m., the lot was nowhere near full. I can see why this is an important feature for tired drivers.",

    "description": "The Disney musical was a box-office flop. Now, it's considered a treasure that helped launch Christian Bale's career. Here's what the cast is up to.",
    "fullText": "In 1992, Disney's movie musical \"Newsies\" made its debut — and it's since become quite a treasure.\n\nLoosely based on the true story of the 1899 newsboys' strike in New York City, the film features a crew of so-called newsies as they sing their way through oppression and fight for a fairer working system.\n\n\"Newsies\" was a box-office flop when it was first released, reportedly making less than $3 million at the box office, even though it cost over $15 million to make.\n\nBut in the years since, \"Newsies\" has built up a passionate group of \"fansies\" and has been adapted into a majorly successful Broadway musical. It has also helped launch the careers of a few young stars.\n\nHere's what the cast of \"Newsies\" is up to 33 years later:\n\nIn 1992, Christian Bale was 17 years old and had a few acting credits to his name until \"Newsies\" came along.\n\nBale portrayed the film's lead Jack Kelly, one of the ringleaders behind the newsies' strike.\n\nBale gave quite a performance singing, dancing, and acting as a rough, 19th-century Manhattan teen fending for himself and his chosen family.\n\n\"Newsies\" wouldn't be Bale's last Disney movie.\n\nHe'd later star in the early-1990s Disney flop \"Swing Kids,\" voice Thomas in 1995's \"Pocahontas,\" and voice Bagheera in 2019's \"Mowgli.\"\n\nOf course, the actor is perhaps most well known for his roles in \"American Psycho,\" \"Ford v Ferrari,\" and the \"Batman\" franchise — though he has starred in several other major movies since his \"Newsies\" days.\n\nDavid Moscow and Bale had undeniable synergy while starring alongside each other in \"Newsies.\"\n\nMoscow played David Jacobs, \"a mouth with a brain\" and a coleader in the fictionalized strike against Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst.\n\n\"Newsies\" might have been Moscow's first Disney musical, but the young star was no stranger to the big screen, having starred in Tom Hanks' \"Big\" just a few years prior.\n\nDecades after singing and dancing next to the future star of the \"Batman\" series, Moscow continues to leave a mark on Hollywood.\n\nHe appeared in 2003's \"Just Married\" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy and produced over a dozen movies.\n\nMoscow also appeared in 2017's \"This Is Christmas\" and \"One Last Night\" — but he's mostly been focusing on behind-the-scenes work.\n\nStarring as David Jacob's younger brother, Les, in the musical, Luke Edwards was no stranger to acting when he landed the role.\n\nBefore starring in \"Newsies,\" Edwards had several acting credits to his name, including a role in the cult-favorite '80s comedy \"The Wizard.\"\n\nEdwards has guest-starred on shows like \"Without a Trace\" and \"True Detective,\" though you might remember Edwards from \"American Pie 2\" or even \"Jeepers Creepers II.\"\n\nEdwards has also appeared in \"The Super,\" \"Adverse,\" and \"My Friend's Play.\"\n\nOne of the older \"Newsies\" in the bunch, Max Casella was 24 years old when he officially made his musical debut as Racetrack Higgins.\n\nAside from having a few TV roles in the 1980s and early 1990s, Casella had not appeared in a major theatrical production prior to this one.\n\nHe was, however, most well known as the time for his role as Vinnie Delpino on \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\"\n\nSince \"Newsies,\" Casella has gone on to make an impressive resume for himself.\n\nHe's lent his voice to characters in \"The Little Mermaid 2,\" \"Dinosaur,\" and \"Courage the Cowardly Dog.\" He has appeared in over two dozen \"Sopranos\" episodes, acted in \"Leatherheads,\" and joined \"Boardwalk Empire\" in 2010.\n\nI recent years, you might have spotted Casella in \"Jackie\" alongside Natalie Portman, or on episodes of \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and \"Tulsa King.\"\n\nAlthough he was only 15 years old when he starred as the spunky Brooklyn newsie Spot Conlon, Gabriel Damon was already quite a seasoned actor with over 30 credits to his name.\n\nNotably, he was the voice of Littlefoot in the fan-favorite animated film, \"The Land Before Time.\"\n\nAside from a few appearances on \"Baywatch\" and a few one-off roles on shows like \"ER\" and \"Sirens,\" Damon has shied away from the acting industry.\n\nHis last noted role was in a short in 2006.\n\n\"Newsies\" was Marty Belafsky's first-ever movie role.\n\nIn the musical, he appeared as the goofy but lovable Crutchy.  He was only 16 years old when \"Newsies\" was released.\n\nWhen he appeared as Boots in the 1992 musical drama, Arvie Lowe Jr. was a 12-year-old actor with no other roles to his name.\n\nAfter \"Newsies\" wrapped, Lowe Jr. found himself starring on popular 1990s shows like \"Sister, Sister,\" \"Moesha,\" and \"Smart Guy.\"\n\nHe even starred on the early aughts Disney Channel show \"Lizzie McGuire\" alongside Hilary Duff.\n\nSince then, he's had a few minor roles in Hollywood, and he's appeared in a few video shorts and commercials. Lowe Jr. is also a graphic designer.\n\nEle Keats had a few acting credits under her belt in Hollywood before landing the role of Sarah Jacobs in \"Newsies.\"\n\nShe played Jack Kelly's love interest, which led to backlash from fans who were unhappy about her kiss with Bale. Some have even referred to her character as the \"Destroyer of Dreams.\"\n\nSince starring in \"Newsies,\" Keats has had a number of small roles and has even guest-starred on shows like \"CSI,\" \"CSI: NY,\" and \"Cold Case.\"\n\nIn the last few years, she's made a name for herself in the horror-film industry, starring in \"Insidious: Chapter 3\" and \"Ouija: Origin of Evil.\"\n\nShe also owns Ele Keats Jewelry, which has a showroom in Santa Monica.\n\nActor Bill Pullman played one of the few redeeming adult characters \"Newsies\" had to offer.\n\nPreviously known for his work in \"Spaceballs,\" among other films, Pullman starred in the Disney musical as passionate journalist Bryan Denton.\n\nRobert Duvall was quite the villain in the musical, where he appeared as publishing mogul Joseph Pulitzer.\n\nPrior to \"Newsies,\" he acted in dozens of works — including \"The Godfather\" and \"The Twilight Zone.\"\n\nAfter \"Newsies,\" Duvall appeared in projects like \"The Apostle,\" \"Deep Impact,\" \"Gone in 60 Seconds,\" and \"Kicking and Screaming.\"\n\nHe continues to make a name for himself in Hollywood, and recently appeared in \"Widows,\" \"Hustle,\" and \"The Pale Blue Eye.\"\n\nCorrection: December 15, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Luke Edwards' first major role. It was in \"The Wizard,\" not \"Newsies.\"\n\nThis story was originally published in August 2018 and most recently updated on December 15, 2025.",

    "description": "Disney staffers spoke about the company's OpenAI deal and AI strategy, including AI tools they are using and one in development codenamed \"Jarvis.\"",
    "fullText": "Disney's billion-dollar OpenAI deal isn't the only way the company is embracing AI. In recent months, the Mouse House has been quietly adding new AI tools to its arsenal and encouraging staff to use them.\n\n\"They clearly see where things are headed,\" a longtime software engineer at Disney said. This marked a shift from this summer, when Disney had seemed \"hesitant to rely on AI tools,\" they said.\n\nDisney has given its employees access to several AI tools, including Microsoft Copilot and Amazon's Q Developer. Thanks to Disney's OpenAI deal, employees will also soon have access to the enterprise version of ChatGPT, the company said.\n\nThen there's a \"DisneyGPT\" chatbot that four staffers said helps with internal requests, such as creating IT support tickets, viewing the company roster, or analyzing a project's financials.\n\nIn an email sent to staff on October 2, Disney introduced the beta version of the chatbot, describing it as a \"new partner in productivity\" designed to help \"unlock the magic of your imagination.\" A December update enabled employees to upload Excel and PowerPoint files to the bot.\n\nDisneyGPT draws on signature Disney themes, with a prompt asking users if they're \"ready for an enchanting adventure\" and \"a verified collection of Walt Disney quotes\" that are \"tagged by themes like imagination, perseverance, and leadership,\" according to the chatbot's December update log. Otherwise, employees said DisneyGPT is mostly a standard AI chatbot.\n\nThere's also an AI chatbot in the works codenamed \"Jarvis,\" four employees said. Jarvis, named for the personal assistant \"J.A.R.V.I.S.\" from \"Iron Man,\" would be an agentic AI tool — more advanced than DisneyGPT — that completes tasks on an employee's behalf, a high-level staffer with direct knowledge of the company's AI efforts said. This person said Jarvis is in its early stages and is \"not fully baked.\"\n\n\"It's definitely something they want to push for everyone to lean into more,\" a Disney manager said of AI.\n\nCompanies in every industry are racing to adopt AI tools to boost productivity. Disney is going further than many, however. The OpenAI deal makes Disney the first major entertainment company to invest in the AI juggernaut, and allows its beloved characters to be used in the video generator Sora.\n\nThis reflects Disney's long tradition of merging innovation and entertainment, dating back to its founder, Walt.\n\nThree of the eight Disney employees who spoke with Business Insider expressed concerns about using AI, specifically that it could replace humans and threaten job security.\n\nThe high-level employee with direct knowledge of Disney's AI strategy said that while AI is a \"top priority,\" it isn't a cure-all. It can make mistakes and lacks a \"personalized touch\" that people provide, they said.\n\n\"If you use AI everywhere, it's going to be counterproductive,\" this person said, adding that tasks still need human creativity.\n\nDisney spokespeople didn't respond to several requests for comment on its internal AI efforts.\n\nOn an internal Disney website explaining its AI policy and tools, the company said it employs a \"responsible and human-centric approach to using AI.\"\n\n\"That means humans are, and will remain, the creative engine of the company,\" Disney said on the site. \"We believe, fundamentally, that human creativity and curiosity are immense and unique — and are at the heart of Disney.\"\n\n\"Simultaneously, our consistent embrace of new technologies has been a key part of empowering our creators and maintaining our leadership in creativity and innovation,\" the company continued in its \"Responsible AI Use\" section.\n\nSeven of the eight Disney staffers Business Insider interviewed have tried or regularly use DisneyGPT or Copilot, which is integrated into employees' email accounts and documents. Many use those AI tools for simple, routine tasks, like writing emails.\n\nDisney has a portal on its website that outlines its AI policy and lists Disney-approved AI tools. Two employees said the company has pointed staffers to AI education or compliance training courses.\n\nSome unsanctioned AI tools like Anthropic's Claude can be more effective than Disney-approved AI tools, three staffers said.\n\nOne employee at Disney-owned ESPN said their manager told them they could use personal accounts on non-approved AI chatbots for work.\n\n\"I'm just using a personal account because Disney isn't allowing us to use these tools yet,\" the ESPN employee said.\n\nThe staffer with direct knowledge of Disney's AI efforts said leadership had tried to make communications about AI \"clear across the board,\" but acknowledged that workers might not \"understand the implications\" of data security risks that could arise from using unsanctioned AI tools. Some staffers told Business Insider it was hard for them to keep up with the availability and restrictions on various AI tools.\n\nWhile some Disney employees expressed mixed feelings about AI, the more bullish among them said Disney was wise to strike a deal with OpenAI.\n\n\"This type of a partnership at least establishes the precedent for getting paid,\" the ESPN employee said.\n\nA Disney ads employee said they believed Disney's deal with OpenAI would \"pay off\" and \"be massive\" in five to 10 years, even if there are growing pains.\n\n\"Disney is smart to push into this,\" this staffer said. \"They are setting the rules of the game, or at least trying.\"",

The startup previously attempted to steer Sora’s output away from unlicensed copyrighted material, though with little success, which prompted threats of lawsuits by rights holders.\n\nDisney announced that it would invest $1bn in OpenAI and, under a three-year deal perhaps worth even more than that large sum, that it would license about 200 of its iconic characters – from R2-D2 to Stitch – for users to play with in OpenAI’s video generation app.\n\nAt a time of intense anxiety in Hollywood over the impact of AI on the livelihoods of writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives, Disney stressed its agreement with OpenAI would not cover talent likenesses or voices.\n\nThe announcement was framed as an extraordinary opportunity to empower fans.\n\nThink of the “fan-inspired Sora short form videos”, as Disney called them in a press release – akin to taking an AI-generated version of a photo with Princess Jasmine at Disney World. OpenAI included screenshots of these kinds of videos in its press release, indicating how the two companies expect people to use the app’s new cast. Sora already allows users to generate videos that include their own likenesses.\n\nBob Iger, Disney’s CEO, said the licensing deal would place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”.\n\nThey may even offer a chance at wide viewership, with some fan-made videos being displayed on the Disney+ streaming service, a move seemingly designed to compete with TikTok’s and YouTube Shorts’ infinite feeds, which themselves often include clips of popular TV shows and movies.",

    "description": "Disney's OpenAI deal comes at a time when the stock is essentially flat over the past 10 years, while the S&P 500 has soared 236%.",
    "fullText": "Things Disney has accomplished in the past 10 years:\n\nThings it hasn't accomplished over the same period:\n\nThis may seem like a wild stat. After all, the S&P 500 is up a whopping 236% over the past decade. But it's true: Disney shares are basically dead flat during the stretch.\n\nFrom a market perspective, the last 10 years have been a total wash.\n\nThe chart above — which looks at Disney's stock versus the benchmark S&P 500 — shows that the key divergence happened in early 2021, which marked Disney's last record high.\n\nThe company has faced a few main headwinds since that top:\n\nAfter Disney+ got off to a fast start, user growth eventually stalled out and prolonged the service's winding path to profitability. The company has also grappled with ESPN's increasingly online audience in the era of cord-cutting, which has contributed to contentious negotiations with TV carriers. (To be fair, all legacy media companies are dealing with the same issues.)\n\nMissing the mark on original content\n\nPixar movies used to be an absolute slam dunk at the box office. No longer. Viewers are also getting fatigued by the constant stream of reboots and sequels. And yes, Disney still has Marvel and Star Wars, although those have lost steam as well. (Note that a similar slowdown has been seen for movie studios overall.)\n\nDisney has caught flak in recent years over the prices at its parks. CEO Bob Iger even admitted in 2023 that the company had been \"too aggressive\" with price hikes. While parks remain a source of relative strength for the company, their cost has left them vulnerable to downturns in consumer sentiment.\n\nWhich brings us to Disney's latest big swing: a $1 billion investment in OpenAI that will integrate iconic characters into the AI video platform Sora. It's notable that Disney is the first major non-tech company to partner with OpenAI.\n\nUpon first glance, the deal feels like a desperate move from a company that's underperformed for a long stretch. But analysts at Citi see it differently.\n\nJason Bazinet, who has a \"buy\" rating on Disney's stock, lauded it as a defensive move, intended to protect the value of the company's IP from cannibalization. He sees it helping to sustain long-term brand value, while also giving it long-term upside in AI. Iger made similar points in defense of the deal.\n\nWe'll see over time if this AI team-up is a catalyst for a grand stock comeback — and if it's a model other companies follow.",

    "fullText": "Mickey Mouse … brought to you by OpenAI.\n\nDisney lending out its iconic characters to be leveraged by AI seemed a far-fetched idea a few months ago. But thanks to a $1 billion deal between the House of Mouse and OpenAI, that's exactly what's happening.\n\nIt's representative of a larger question companies, especially those in media and entertainment, are grappling with: Are AI companies friend or foe?\n\nFor Bob Iger, the answer is very much friend.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,\" the Disney CEO told CNBC on Thursday.\n\nThe deal will allow Disney+ to post users' AI-generated content, a goal that Iger mentioned last month. Doing so could help boost engagement on the streamer's platform, which has been stagnant in recent years, writes BI's Lucia Moses.\n\n(I should probably mention Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, also falls in the \"friend\" camp. It cut a deal with OpenAI almost two years ago.)\n\nOthers aren't as willing to rub shoulders with OpenAI. The startup has a history of using someone's intellectual property without permission and then apologizing for it. That has resulted in several lawsuits, including those from The New York Times and \"Game of Thrones\" author George R.R. Martin.\n\nSo who's right? It's too early to say, but it could easily go both ways.\n\nThe longer one waits to cut a deal with an AI company, the worse the terms could be. (The benefits of first-mover advantage.) On the other hand, opening yourself up to AI could be a kind of Pandora's box you can't close.\n\nHere's what some smart people in media, tech, and business are saying about the deal.\n\nThe deal isn't just beneficial to Disney.\n\nDisney characters coming to Sora 2 could be a big boost for a video platform that hit a bit of a lull after a hot start a few months ago.\n\nBringing characters from \"Frozen\" and \"Moana\" to life on your app is also a great way to generate interest and build loyalty with a younger audience. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently touted the personal benefits he finds from using ChatGPT as a new parent.\n\nBut pursuing a younger demographic also comes as some countries are putting up more guardrails around kids' use of tech. Australia recently installed a ban on social media for anyone under the age of 16.\n\nThe Disney-OpenAI deal also comes as competition keeps mounting against the startup from the likes of Google and others. And while so much of AI is about pushing cutting-edge tech, sometimes you just need a little bit of old-school magic.",

    "description": "OpenAI said Thursday it had struck a licensing agreement to use Disney's characters and other intellectual property.",
    "fullText": "It's likely just a matter of time before we see the wisened duo of Rafiki and Jiminy Cricket weilding lightsabers on the icy plains of Arendelle.\n\nThat's courtesy of artificial intelligence, of course, and a new deal between Disney and OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI said Thursday it had struck a licensing agreement to use Disney's characters and other intellectual property. Disney will also invest $1 billion in OpenAI and will purchase ChatGPT Enterprise for its employees.\n\nIt's a major shift for Disney, which has historically been deeply protective of its intellectual property. And it's a big win for OpenAI, which is on a quest for more content to feed its AI models.\n\nFor users, the deal will enable them to recreate Disney characters on Sora, OpenAI's short-form video generation app, and to create images of Disney characters using ChatGPT.\n\nBeyond the limitless possibilities for creative content, the deal reveals a lot about Disney's strategy in the AI age and the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of entertainment.\n\nHere's what some smart people in media, tech, and business are saying about the deal.\n\nFor Nick Cicero, the founder of Delmondo, a social media video analytics company that was acquired by Conviva in 2018, Disney's deal with OpenAI is less about AI and more about revenue.\n\nCicero argued in an X post on Thursday that Disney was aiming to solve two \"existential\" problems: creators using unauthorized Disney content and kids watching YouTube instead of Disney+.\n\n\"Sora gives Disney its first scalable way to pull creator-made content into its own premium ecosystem — brand-safe, trackable, legal, and ready for CTV monetization,\" he said, referring to the practice of delivering targeted advertising to internet-connected televisions.\n\n\"This move isn't about tech,\" he added. \"It's about revenue physics.\"\n\nChatbots like ChatGPT rely on data to power their outputs, and when it comes to collecting that data, AI companies are insatiable.\n\nThe drive to collect data often pits AI companies against content creators. Numerous media companies have sued OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and other leading AI outfits for using their copyrighted content without permission. Other media companies, like Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, have struck deals with AI companies to license their content.\n\nPeter Csathy, a longtime media consultant and analyst, said Disney's deal with OpenAI is a \"watershed\" moment for AI and media licensing.\n\n\"Now THIS is a generative AI use that makes sense to me and I support,\" Csathy wrote on LinkedIn. \"Fully licensed characters, thereby respecting copyright and embracing partnership with the creative community (rather than theft of IP). New revenue streams for IP rights-holders. And overall delight by fans of those beloved characters.\"\n\nThere are just so many cease-and-desist letters a media lawyer can send.\n\nCarline Giegerich, a vice president at the Interactive Advertising Bureau who once led emerging tech at HBO, says Disney's deal with OpenAI feels like a \"can't beat 'em, join 'em\" moment.\n\n\"When I was at HBO from '05 - '09, I marveled at the sheer volume of cease and desists from the legal team when mobile video was up and coming,\" she wrote on LinkedIn. \"I thought it seemed difficult to fight against the entire internet, and it turns out it was. And AI presents a similar challenge.\"\n\nShe also said the deal presents a valuable marketing opportunity for Disney.\n\n\"Important to note that a selection of these fan-created videos will be available to stream on Disney+. What that means to me is that Disney sees this also as a marketing and content opportunity, which it is,\" she said.\n\nDisney's pivot from aggressively defending its IP at every turn to giving it over to the world's leading AI startup might be strategic for another reason.\n\nJames Miller, the head of business development at Amazon for media, entertainment, and Amazon Creators, said he suspects it's a matter of \"controlling the inevitable.\"\n\nAny IP eventually enters the public domain. In 2024, the copyright for Mickey Mouse himself — at least the sans white gloves version of the 1930s — expired, allowing anyone to use his likeness. Winnie the Pooh, Snow White, Cinderella, and a handful of other Disney characters also entered the public domain at the same time.\n\n\"By officially licensing these characters now, Disney does three things,\" Miller wrote on LinkedIn. \"1. Monetizes the AI trend rather than just fighting it in court. 2. Sets the quality standard for how their characters appear in AI video (likely drowning out lower-quality unauthorized versions). 3. Captures data on how fans want to use their IP before they lose exclusive rights.\"\n\nOne consumer expert said that Disney might have gotten the short end of the stick in this partnership.\n\n\"Looks like OpenAI used the #jedimindwarp on The Walt Disney Company, not the other way around,\" Karl Haller, an IBM partner and the leader of the firm's Consumer Center of Competency, said in a post on LinkedIn.\n\nHe said he was \"more than a bit surprised\" to see that Disney is letting OpenAI license its IP for Sora and other AI tools, with some of the videos being made available to stream on Disney+.\n\n\"And what does Disney receive for this? Negative $1 billion,\" he wrote. \"Rather than receiving a heftly license fee, Disney is instead investing $1B in OpenAI and receiving warrants to buy \n\nOne entertainment lawyer pointed out that the deal comes with a lot of unanswered questions.\n\n\"This is a fairly stunning story all round with many questions,\" Simon Pullman, a partner at law firm Pryor Cashman, wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday.\n\n\"Will audiences want/accept 'AI UGC' on Disney Plus,\" he wrote, referring to user-generated content. \"Will it be possible for Disney to unring the bell after three years and not extend the license? How will they protect against misuse and brand damage?\"\n\nDisney's $1 billion bet on AI is the right move for the media giant, according to Mike Walsh, the CEO of consulting firm Tomorrow.\n\n\"By partnering with OpenAI while suing Midjourney and warning Google, Disney is drawing a clear line,\" Walsh wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday. \"Remix culture isn't going away, but it will be licensed, governed, and designed on its terms.\"\n\nHe added that Disney has always survived new media eras with this strategy.\n\n\"The future of entertainment belongs to companies that shape participation instead of fighting it,\" he wrote.",

    "fullText": "Disney is losing the war for attention. Can its blockbuster OpenAI licensing deal change the momentum on the battlefield?\n\nSoon, you'll be able to use OpenAI products, such as ChatGPT and the video generator Sora, to create content featuring Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, and Darth Vader.\n\nCEO Bob Iger said the move would let Disney take advantage of a fast-growing area of entertainment.\n\nIger said initially Disney would \"curate some of the videos that have been created on the Sora platform and put them onto Disney+, which we think is a great way to increase engagement with our Disney+ users, particularly the younger users.\" Iger said eventually the company wants users to create AI videos within Disney+ itself.\n\nThere's a key word in Iger's comment that signals why Disney might be particularly motivated to make this deal: engagement.\n\nTime people spend on Disney's and other leading streaming services has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, while YouTube and social video have grown. Disney's share of US TV viewership for its streaming services — including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — has been stuck at around 4.8% this year, according to Nielsen. YouTube is the top streaming platform on TVs, with a nearly 13% share in October, and its lead has been widening.\n\nData from analytics firm Luminate showed that engagement with Disney+'s original content fell to a 3% share of US viewing time in the third quarter of 2025. That's down from 9% three years earlier, the largest decline among paid streamers.\n\nDisney has been highly protective of its famous characters and favors keeping people on its own platforms. This stance has made it difficult for the company to capitalize on the rise of user-generated content. And it's losing its monopoly on its core constituency, kids, as they increasingly watch YouTube over Disney+.\n\nTraditional media companies are struggling to grow, so they're trying to figure out new ways to get people to engage with their content, whether it be games, live events, or fan content creation, media analyst Doug Shapiro, a senior advisor at BCG, recently told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse,\" he said. \"I think they're all asking themselves, how can they have a deeper relationship with fans?\"\n\nDisney invested $1.5 billion in Fortnite maker Epic Games last year and struck a deal with Webtoon to create a new digital platform for Disney's comics, including Marvel and Star Wars. Outside Disney, Netflix is opening Netflix Houses, mini theme parks in malls that let people enter the worlds of its popular shows. Amazon has backed Fable Studios, a startup that has an AI streaming platform that lets users make their own shows and play with existing IP.\n\nJohn Attanasio, CEO of Toonstar, a tech-driven animation studio, said Disney's IP is so popular that the Sora videos could help drive more audience. He thought Disney could potentially charge for access to AI tools on Disney+ or use the Sora videos to discover franchise extensions.\n\n\"UGC, when it's so specific, the reach is limited,\" he said. \"But when you use known IP, that expands the potential audience.\"\n\nDisney fans and Hollywood insiders had mixed reactions to the OpenAI news.\n\nShae Noble, a Disney superfan in her late 30s, said she could see herself sending birthday messages or making fan videos of the characters interacting in interesting ways — especially if it were integrated into Disney+.\n\n\"I've already seen some of the negative impacts of AI and people pushing it too far to create harmful images,\" she added. \"So it's smart of them to be proactive about it.\"\n\nSome in Hollywood worried about the risks to professional creators.\n\nFor one thing, the deal puts the emphasis on existing IP rather than making new content, Toonstar's Attanasio said.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America came out swinging against the deal, and said it planned to meet with Disney to explore how much the pact would let user-generated videos use the work of its members.\n\nSam Tung, a storyboard artist and cochair of the Animation Guild's AI committee, wondered if OpenAI's guardrails would be strong enough to protect Disney's IP, recalling a widely publicized incident earlier this year when Fortnite users used AI to make the Darth Vader character swear. He also doubted the UGC would move the needle on engagement.\n\n\"I think what audiences want is high-quality stuff to watch with your family,\" Tung said.\n\nJames Faris contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "Agreement comes amid anxiety in Hollywood over impact of AI on the industry, expression and rights of creators\n\nWalt Disney has announced a $1bn equity investment in OpenAI, enabling the AI startup’s Sora video generation tool to use its characters.\n\nUsers of Sora will be able to generate short, user-prompted social videos that draw on more than 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars characters as part of a three-year licensing agreement between OpenAI and the entertainment giant.\n\nThe agreement – a landmark deal amid intense anxiety in Hollywood over the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of entertainment – will not cover talent likenesses or voices.\n\nBob Iger, Disney’s CEO, hailed a deal which paired his firm’s “iconic stories and characters” with OpenAI’s AI technology. It will place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”, he claimed.\n\nThe deal is OpenAI’s most prominent move into Hollywood after a contentious rollout of Sora and longstanding pushback against AI from many entertainment industry workers. Concerns from writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives over AI replacing jobs and using likenesses without consent has led to union protests and copyright lawsuits against AI companies.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched its latest iteration of Sora earlier this year, it immediately ran into a slew of potential copyright issues, as feeds became dominated by videos featuring characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants or Pikachu – sometimes generated to appear in Nazi-like clothing.\n\nRacist depictions of Martin Luther King Jr prompted OpenAI to ban the use of his likeness on the platform, while the daughter of Malcolm X called seeing her father’s image on Sora “deeply disrespectful and hurtful”.\n\nDisney itself has also been concerned over the unauthorized use of its characters by generative AI platforms. The company sent a stern cease-and-desist letter to the Character.AI chatbot firm in October, alleging that the platform was “blatantly infringing on Disney’s copyrights” through using the likeness of its characters.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, attorneys representing Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, demanding that the technology company’s AI systems stop alleged infringement, Variety reported.\n\nThe OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, has been on a charm offensive that included a recent appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, the US talkshow. On Thursday, he touted the firm’s deal with Disney as proof that artificial intelligence companies could partner with the entertainment sector.\n\n“This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences,” Altman said.\n\nIn addition to Disney letting its characters appear in Sora, the company will also use OpenAI’s application programming interfaces to build new products and tools, becoming a major customer of the ChatGPT maker. A selection of the videos made by users on Sora will also be available for streaming on the Disney+ platform. It will also deploy ChatGPT for its employees, the companies said.\n\n“Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world,” said Iger. “The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”",

    "description": "Darth Vader and other Disney characters are coming to ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora AI video app as part of a three-year licensing deal.",
    "fullText": "Darth Vader is coming to ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora AI video app.\n\nThe House of Mouse and OpenAI struck a three-year licensing agreement on Thursday to make Disney \"the first major content licensing partner on Sora.\"\n\nIt's also investing $1 billion into the AI pioneer and receiving warrants to purchase additional equity.\n\nShares of Disney climbed over 2% after the opening bell.\n\n\"As part of this new, three-year licensing agreement, Sora will be able to generate short, user-prompted social videos that can be viewed and shared by fans, drawing from a set of more than 200 animated, masked and creature characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars, including costumes, props, vehicles, and iconic environments,\" OpenAI said in a Thursday announcement.\n\nIn addition to striking a licensing deal, Disney is also becoming a \"major customer\" of the AI company, according to the announcement, and buying ChatGPT enterprise licenses for its employees.\n\nWhile Sora, OpenAI's TikTok-like AI video app, has been generating buzz and downloads since its launch earlier this year, users of the company's more popular product, ChatGPT, will also have access to AI versions of Disney's characters as part of the deal.\n\nThe AI-generated Disney characters will be available starting in early 2026.\n\nThe move is likely to prove controversial in Hollywood, where many actors have publicly voiced concern about AI use and concerns over how their likeness is used. Disney and OpenAI stated that \"the agreement does not include any talent likenesses or voices.\"\n\nCreators are core to Disney, and its CEO Bob Iger stressed that the deal represented no threat to creators.\n\n\"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license to be associated with it,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Thursday.\n\n\"The other thing it does is it enables us to be comfortable that Open AI is putting guardrails essentially around how these are used, so that really there's nothing for us to be concerned about from a consumer perspective, meaning this will be a safe environment and a safe way for consumers to engage with our founders in a new way,\" he added.\n\nIger hinted at such a transaction during the company's most recent earnings call, making extensive comments about the potential he sees for AI to enhance Disney's direct-to-consumer strategy. He said the company was having extensive talks with AI companies to protect its IP as well as generate more engagement with users.\n\nHis comments demonstrate how Disney — like other Hollywood players — is looking for new ways for people to interact with its platforms and brands as user-generated content platforms and independent creators gain popularity.\n\nDisney, like those other players, has an engagement problem. The time people spend on streaming has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, despite increased spending on content, while YouTube has grown. The bet with AI is that it can get people to spend more time on its platforms by giving them more ways to play around with its famous franchises.\n\nThe companies hinted as much in the announcement, saying that they would \"collaborate to utilize OpenAI's models to power new experiences for Disney + subscribers.\"\n\nDisney is also wary of the tech's risk to its IP. In June, Disney, along with Comcast's NBCUniversal studio business, sued AI company Midjourney, claiming its tech created unauthorized copies of works ranging from Star Wars to The Simpsons. Midjourney denied the claims in its legal response. The suit is ongoing.\n\nDisney's $1 billion cash infusion comes at a critical time for OpenAI, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly $1.4 trillion the AI company has pledged to spend over the next eight years on data centers.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously said that large rights holders would ultimately welcome their content being used on Sora, provided it was done with proper guardrails in place. His comments came after OpenAI stepped up restrictions on the Sora app in the wake of viral user-generated videos depicting SpongeBob as Walter White and Pikachu in \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\n\n\"Most of the rights holders that I've spoken to are actually extremely excited to get their content in here,\" Altman told tech analyst Ben Thompson in October. \"They just want to be able to set more restrictions than they would need for images because videos feel different.\"",

    "description": "Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company's licensing deal with OpenAI will let it capitalize on a fast-growing technology and engage younger audiences.",
    "fullText": "Disney CEO Bob Iger says his company's major licensing deal with OpenAI is all about establishing a foothold in a new realm of entertainment and engaging younger audiences.\n\nThe licensing agreement gives ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora video platform access to Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Darth Vader. Disney is also investing $1 billion in the AI company and becoming a \"major customer.\"\n\nSpeaking on CNBC about the deal with OpenAI's Sam Altman on Thursday, Iger said it gives Disney a chance to get in on a fast-growing area of tech.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,\" Iger said.\n\nIger said the deal also fulfills a longtime desire by Disney to put user-generated content on its Disney+ streaming platform. Disney initially plans to put select videos created on Sora onto Disney+ to increase engagement with users, especially younger ones. Ultimately, Iger wants to let Disney+ users create such videos within the platform itself.\n\n\"That's a big step for us,\" he said.\n\nDisney has long been highly protective of its famous characters and storylines, and Iger is widely seen in Hollywood as a champion of the creative set. But like other entertainment players, Disney has an engagement problem. The time people spend on streaming has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, despite increased spending on content. Social media and user-generated content, in contrast, continue to rise. The bet with OpenAI is that the deal can get people to spend more time on Disney platforms by giving them new ways to play around with its famous franchises.\n\nIger has long positioned the company as pro-technology, and he said, in reference to the OpenAI deal, that he'd rather participate in technological innovation than be disrupted by it.\n\n\"We think this is actually a way for us to be part of these developments, as opposed to being harmed by them,\" he said.\n\nIger said the deal is also a way for Disney to participate in the big rise in user-generated short-form video on social-media platforms.\n\nAltman said Thursday that the demand for Disney characters, in particular, is \"off the charts\" on OpenAI's products. He said he sees the deal enabling people to do things like putting themselves in a lightsaber scene from \"Star Wars\" or creating a custom birthday video for their kid using the Buzz Lightyear character.\n\nAI firms have been \"frenemies\" to media companies, as many in Hollywood are concerned about how they use copyrighted material and the threat that they could pose to the creative process. Iger said the OpenAI deal is good for creators rather than a threat.\n\n\"This does not in any way represent a threat to the creators at all. In fact, the opposite,\" Iger said. \"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license to be associated with it.\"\n\nDisney said the agreement does not include any talent likeness or voices and that OpenAI would have guardrails in place to make sure Disney's IP was used in a safe way.\n\nIn June, Disney, along with Comcast's NBCUniversal studio business, sued AI company Midjourney, claiming its tech created unauthorized copies of works ranging from Star Wars to The Simpsons. Midjourney denied the claims in its legal response. That suit is ongoing.",

    "description": "Disney is literally paying $1 billion for this.",
    "fullText": "If you've engaged in any sort of doomscrolling over the past year, you've no doubt encountered some wild AI-generated content. While there are plenty of AI video generators out there producing this stuff, one of the most prevalent is OpenAI's Sora, which is particularly adept at generating realistic short-form videos mimicking the content you might find on TikTok or Instagram Reels. These videos can be so convincing at first glance, that people often don't realize what they're seeing is 100% fake. That can be harmless when it's videos of cats playing instruments at midnight, but dangerous when impersonating real people or properties.\n\nIt's that last point that I thought would offer some pushback to AI's seemingly exponential growth. These companies have trained their AI models on huge amounts of data, much of which is copyrighted, which means that people are able to generate images and videos of iconic characters like Pikachu, Superman, and Darth Vader. The big AI generators put guardrails on their platforms to try to prevent videos that infringe on copyright, but people find a way around them. As such, corporations have already started suing OpenAI, Google, and other AI companies over this blatant IP theft. (Disclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April 2025, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\n\nBut it seems not all companies want to go down this path. Take Disney, as a prime example. On Thursday, OpenAI announced that it had made a three-year licensing agreement with the company behind Mickey Mouse. As part of the deal, Sora users can now generate videos featuring over 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars characters. The announcement names the following characters and movies specifically:\n\nThat includes licensed costumes, props, vehicles, and environments. What's more, Disney+ will host a \"selection\" of these \"fan-inspired\" Sora videos. (I'll admit, that last point genuinely shocks me.) This does only apply to Disney's visual assets, however, as Sora users won't have access to voice acting. ChatGPT users will also be able to generate images with these characters, so this news doesn't just affect Sora users.\n\nYou might think OpenAI is paying Disney a hefty licensing fee here, but it appears to be quite the opposite. Not only is Disney pledging to use OpenAI APIs to build \"products, tools, and experiences,\" it is rolling out ChatGPT to its employees as well. Oh, and the company is making a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI. (Is that all?)\n\nI know many companies are embracing AI, often in ways I disagree with. But this deal is something else entirely. I'm not sure any Disney executives actually searched for \"Sora Disney\" on the internet, because right now, you'll find fake AI trailers for Pixar movies filled with racism, sexual content, and generally offensive content—all generated using an app Disney just licensed all of its properties to. OpenAI asserts in its announcement that both companies are committed to preventing \"illegal or harmful\" content on the platform, but Sora users are already creating harmful content. What kind of content can we expect with carte blanch access to Disney's properties?\n\nNow that Disney's characters are fair game, I can't imagine the absolute slop that some users are going to make here. The only hope I have is in the fact that Disney+ is going to host some of these videos. Staff will have to weed through some garbage to find videos that are actually suitable for the platform. And maybe seeing the \"content\" that Sora users like to make with iconic characters will be enough for Disney to rethink its plans.",

    "description": "YouTube TV will offer a cheaper sports-focused package in 2026, which it can offer after tough negotiations with Disney and other media companies.",
    "fullText": "YouTube TV will unveil new prices soon. But this time, it will be good news for sports fans.\n\nYouTube is launching a set of cheaper, slimmed-down versions of its popular live TV service in 2026, which it's calling \"YouTube TV Plans,\" the video giant announced on Wednesday. One of the new plans will be a sports bundle that provides access to ESPN Unlimited, FS1, and NBC Sports Network.\n\nWhile YouTube TV isn't yet revealing pricing for these 10 or so genre-specific packages, they'll cost less than the Google-owned service's typical rate, which is $83 a month.\n\n\"Our goal is to let you tailor your subscription with more options,\" said Christian Oestlien, YouTube's head of subscriptions, in a statement. \"Whether you stick with our main YouTube TV plan with 100+ channels, focus on sports, combine sports and news, or select a plan centered on family or entertainment content, subscribers will be able to easily choose the plan that works best for them.\"\n\nYouTube TV secured the rights to form these so-called \"skinny bundles\" after hard-fought negotiations with Disney, Comcast's NBC, and Fox. YouTube TV's battle with Disney was especially intense, as it left subscribers without ESPN and ABC for 15 days.\n\nJustin Connolly, YouTube's global head of media and sports, said at a media event on Tuesday night that YouTube worked with its partners on \"ingesting the entirety of the sports programming\" in its service, so that YouTube TV can be a one-stop shop for sports fans. Besides aggregating live games, Connolly said YouTube is being fan-friendly by aiming to \"meet the consumer where they are\" on price.\n\nYouTube TV's price has steadily increased since it launched in 2017 at $35, though it's also added more channels. Last December, YouTube TV's monthly price rose by $10.\n\nOther TV providers have launched sports-focused skinny bundles, with some tradeoffs.\n\nFubo's $55.99 a month Sports + News bundle includes all of ESPN and Fox's channels, plus CBS and the NFL Network, but it doesn't have NBC or Warner Bros. Discovery's networks like TNT or TruTV. It also doesn't have the news networks CNN and MS Now (formerly MSNBC), though it has Fox News.\n\nSling TV's Orange & Blue bundle goes for $60.99 and has ESPN, Fox with cable sidekick FS1, WBD's channels like TNT and CNN, and the NFL Network. It also carries local channels like NBC and ABC in certain markets. But Sling doesn't have a deal with CBS, plus its main bundle doesn't include specialty sports networks like the SEC Network, the Big Ten Network, or NBA TV. Sling offers a Sports Extra add-on for $15 a month on its main plan, bringing the total to $76.\n\nDirecTV's MySports package costs $69.99 but is more comprehensive, with the full suites of ESPN, Fox, and WBD, plus all four major local broadcast networks: ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox (with possible exceptions in certain markets). It also carries the flagship networks for four major US sports: the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL.\n\nSports fans could complement those skinny bundles by buying a digital antenna or by using streaming services like Peacock or Paramount+ that give access to NBC and CBS, respectively.\n\nESPN also offers a subscription to its entire suite for $29.99 a month, or a bundle with competing streamer Fox One for $39.99 a month.\n\nYouTube said its new sports plan will have ESPN's full suite of programming plus sports channels from Fox and NBC, with the option to add on NFL Sunday Ticket and RedZone for more money. Otherwise, it's unclear exactly which channels this bundle will have.\n\nAs YouTube TV's sports bundle enters the market, sports fans have more choices than ever. The challenge for them now is finding the right plan.",

    "description": "Former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer predicts \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros. between Netflix and Paramount.",
    "fullText": "A former Disney executive who oversaw its dealmaking expects \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer\" from Netflix, Paramount Skydance, or both, said Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, on Tuesday at the UBS media conference.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion, including debt. Paramount Skydance then launched a hostile offer, saying on Monday that it's willing to pay $108.4 billion for the whole firm, including the TV networks like CNN and HGTV. Executives at Netflix and Paramount CEO David Ellison have each framed their offers as the best for employees, Hollywood, WBD shareholders, and TV viewers. Both suitors also said they're confident they can pass regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMayer, now the co-CEO of Cocomelon owner Candle Media, said he thinks Paramount's hostile bid will reignite the faceoff for Warner Bros. and force the eventual winner to fork over more money.\n\n\"From the Warner Bros. Discovery perspective, this is nothing but good news,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer added: \"Does it move up another $5 billion or $10 billion? I think it probably does. That's what it's going to take to win it.\"\n\nMayer said the battle for Warner Bros. reminds him of the fight for control of 21st Century Fox between Disney and Comcast, which he was involved in during his tenure at the Mouse House.\n\nUnder Mayer, Disney agreed to buy Fox's studio, FX, and its stake in Hulu for $52.4 billion in equity, or $66.1 billion with debt, in December 2017. Six months later, cable giant Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash offer for those same assets. Disney ultimately won, but it was forced to pay a heftier price of $71.3 billion. Mayer helped engineer Disney's initial agreement with Fox, but had moved to a role atop Disney's streaming business by the time the acquisition closed.\n\n\"That was a difficult process,\" Mayer said of Comcast's bid for Fox. \"It added $19 billion to the price tag. Still a good deal, but not the exceptional deal that it was before we had to pay more.\"\n\nWhile Disney's deal with Fox gave it control over Hulu and bolstered its library, Disney activist investor Nelson Peltz argued that the Mouse House had shown \"poor judgment\" by \"overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets.\"\n\nAs Netflix and Paramount vie for Warner Bros., Mayer said the Disney-Comcast showdown \"points to where we might see this going.\"\n\nThat's because Ellison's $30-per-share hostile bid, which Paramount also sent to WBD's board, might not be rich enough, Mayer said.\n\n\"David Ellison has already kind of hinted at that, that he hasn't done his best and final yet, and I suspect he hasn't,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer was likely referencing a text message from Ellison to WBD CEO David Zaslav, which was made public as part of a Paramount filing on Monday: \"Please note importantly we did not include 'best and final' in our bid.\"\n\n\"The team at Paramount is aggressive,\" Mayer said. He pointed to the gargantuan amount of money that David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry, have at their disposal.\n\n\"I don't think there's a whole lot of hesitancy to spend it,\" Mayer said.",
