    "description": "YouTube TV will offer a cheaper sports-focused package in 2026, which it can offer after tough negotiations with Disney and other media companies.",
    "fullText": "YouTube TV will unveil new prices soon. But this time, it will be good news for sports fans.\n\nYouTube is launching a set of cheaper, slimmed-down versions of its popular live TV service in 2026, which it's calling \"YouTube TV Plans,\" the video giant announced on Wednesday. One of the new plans will be a sports bundle that provides access to ESPN Unlimited, FS1, and NBC Sports Network.\n\nWhile YouTube TV isn't yet revealing pricing for these 10 or so genre-specific packages, they'll cost less than the Google-owned service's typical rate, which is $83 a month.\n\n\"Our goal is to let you tailor your subscription with more options,\" said Christian Oestlien, YouTube's head of subscriptions, in a statement. \"Whether you stick with our main YouTube TV plan with 100+ channels, focus on sports, combine sports and news, or select a plan centered on family or entertainment content, subscribers will be able to easily choose the plan that works best for them.\"\n\nYouTube TV secured the rights to form these so-called \"skinny bundles\" after hard-fought negotiations with Disney, Comcast's NBC, and Fox. YouTube TV's battle with Disney was especially intense, as it left subscribers without ESPN and ABC for 15 days.\n\nJustin Connolly, YouTube's global head of media and sports, said at a media event on Tuesday night that YouTube worked with its partners on \"ingesting the entirety of the sports programming\" in its service, so that YouTube TV can be a one-stop shop for sports fans. Besides aggregating live games, Connolly said YouTube is being fan-friendly by aiming to \"meet the consumer where they are\" on price.\n\nYouTube TV's price has steadily increased since it launched in 2017 at $35, though it's also added more channels. Last December, YouTube TV's monthly price rose by $10.\n\nOther TV providers have launched sports-focused skinny bundles, with some tradeoffs.\n\nFubo's $55.99 a month Sports + News bundle includes all of ESPN and Fox's channels, plus CBS and the NFL Network, but it doesn't have NBC or Warner Bros. Discovery's networks like TNT or TruTV. It also doesn't have the news networks CNN and MS Now (formerly MSNBC), though it has Fox News.\n\nSling TV's Orange & Blue bundle goes for $60.99 and has ESPN, Fox with cable sidekick FS1, WBD's channels like TNT and CNN, and the NFL Network. It also carries local channels like NBC and ABC in certain markets. But Sling doesn't have a deal with CBS, plus its main bundle doesn't include specialty sports networks like the SEC Network, the Big Ten Network, or NBA TV. Sling offers a Sports Extra add-on for $15 a month on its main plan, bringing the total to $76.\n\nDirecTV's MySports package costs $69.99 but is more comprehensive, with the full suites of ESPN, Fox, and WBD, plus all four major local broadcast networks: ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox (with possible exceptions in certain markets). It also carries the flagship networks for four major US sports: the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL.\n\nSports fans could complement those skinny bundles by buying a digital antenna or by using streaming services like Peacock or Paramount+ that give access to NBC and CBS, respectively.\n\nESPN also offers a subscription to its entire suite for $29.99 a month, or a bundle with competing streamer Fox One for $39.99 a month.\n\nYouTube said its new sports plan will have ESPN's full suite of programming plus sports channels from Fox and NBC, with the option to add on NFL Sunday Ticket and RedZone for more money. Otherwise, it's unclear exactly which channels this bundle will have.\n\nAs YouTube TV's sports bundle enters the market, sports fans have more choices than ever. The challenge for them now is finding the right plan.",

    "description": "Former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer predicts \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros. between Netflix and Paramount.",
    "fullText": "A former Disney executive who oversaw its dealmaking expects \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer\" from Netflix, Paramount Skydance, or both, said Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, on Tuesday at the UBS media conference.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion, including debt. Paramount Skydance then launched a hostile offer, saying on Monday that it's willing to pay $108.4 billion for the whole firm, including the TV networks like CNN and HGTV. Executives at Netflix and Paramount CEO David Ellison have each framed their offers as the best for employees, Hollywood, WBD shareholders, and TV viewers. Both suitors also said they're confident they can pass regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMayer, now the co-CEO of Cocomelon owner Candle Media, said he thinks Paramount's hostile bid will reignite the faceoff for Warner Bros. and force the eventual winner to fork over more money.\n\n\"From the Warner Bros. Discovery perspective, this is nothing but good news,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer added: \"Does it move up another $5 billion or $10 billion? I think it probably does. That's what it's going to take to win it.\"\n\nMayer said the battle for Warner Bros. reminds him of the fight for control of 21st Century Fox between Disney and Comcast, which he was involved in during his tenure at the Mouse House.\n\nUnder Mayer, Disney agreed to buy Fox's studio, FX, and its stake in Hulu for $52.4 billion in equity, or $66.1 billion with debt, in December 2017. Six months later, cable giant Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash offer for those same assets. Disney ultimately won, but it was forced to pay a heftier price of $71.3 billion. Mayer helped engineer Disney's initial agreement with Fox, but had moved to a role atop Disney's streaming business by the time the acquisition closed.\n\n\"That was a difficult process,\" Mayer said of Comcast's bid for Fox. \"It added $19 billion to the price tag. Still a good deal, but not the exceptional deal that it was before we had to pay more.\"\n\nWhile Disney's deal with Fox gave it control over Hulu and bolstered its library, Disney activist investor Nelson Peltz argued that the Mouse House had shown \"poor judgment\" by \"overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets.\"\n\nAs Netflix and Paramount vie for Warner Bros., Mayer said the Disney-Comcast showdown \"points to where we might see this going.\"\n\nThat's because Ellison's $30-per-share hostile bid, which Paramount also sent to WBD's board, might not be rich enough, Mayer said.\n\n\"David Ellison has already kind of hinted at that, that he hasn't done his best and final yet, and I suspect he hasn't,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer was likely referencing a text message from Ellison to WBD CEO David Zaslav, which was made public as part of a Paramount filing on Monday: \"Please note importantly we did not include 'best and final' in our bid.\"\n\n\"The team at Paramount is aggressive,\" Mayer said. He pointed to the gargantuan amount of money that David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry, have at their disposal.\n\n\"I don't think there's a whole lot of hesitancy to spend it,\" Mayer said.",
