    "description": "From Disney's $1 billion bet on OpenAI to a wave of blockbuster acquihires, these deals reshaped the tech industry in 2025.",
    "fullText": "While most of the industry was out of office over the holidays, Nvidia and SoftBank's deal teams were grinding.\n\nBoth companies chose the year's quietest stretch to drop news that was anything but: SoftBank said Monday it will acquire digital infrastructure investor DigitalBridge for about $4 billion.\n\nNvidia's move was stranger still. On Christmas Eve, it announced a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement\" with Groq, the startup behind custom chips designed to handle AI inference — the real-time work that powers chatbot replies. The companies did not disclose financial terms.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't call it an acquisition, the guts of the arrangement looked familiar. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, along with top engineering staff, will head to Nvidia. Groq, last valued at $6.9 billion in a funding round three months ago, will continue to operate independently.\n\nIt's the latest example of a new kind of tech dealmaking, where the founder and key engineers get bought out, the technology gets siphoned off, and the startup itself is left in limbo.\n\nThat's the vibe of 2025: big, hairy deals that refuse to stay inside the lines.\n\nThe industry's biggest moves weren't just splashy acquisitions or eye-watering funding rounds. (We saw those deals, too.) They were sprawling, hard-to-categorize transactions. Money came tied to compute. Licensing came paired with talent raids. Infrastructure deals locked governments and corporate America into yearslong dependencies. These weren't neat mergers or simple checks. They were power grabs that shifted the balance of Silicon Valley and beyond.\n\nThese were the eight deals that defined the year in AI, ranked from smallest to largest by dollar value.\n\nNvidia ended the year doing the same thing that turned heads all year: extracting founders from their startups and leaving other employees to figure it out.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Nvidia announced it had entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq. The financial terms were undisclosed.\n\nUnder the agreement, Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other team members, will join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of over $4.5 trillion.\n\nGroq will continue to operate as an independent company, with CFO Simon Edwards assuming the CEO role.\n\nDisney struck a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI in December, becoming the first major content partner for Sora, OpenAI's video generator.\n\nThe deal isn't just about rights. Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI and receive warrants to buy additional equity — a structure that ties content, distribution, and upside together.\n\nBusiness Insider reporter Lucia Moses argues the logic can be summed up in one word: engagement. Time spent on Disney+ and other major streaming services has remained essentially flat in recent years, she writes, while YouTube and social video continue to grow.\n\nThe OpenAI partnership could help Disney meet audiences where they already are, by allowing fans to use tools like ChatGPT and Sora to generate and remix content featuring Disney characters.\n\nDeveloper coding assistant Windsurf was a startup Cinderella story. Then it became a cautionary tale.\n\nThe company was in talks to sell to OpenAI for $3 billion this past spring. The deal fell apart at the last minute.\n\nGoogle emerged as a new suitor. Instead of an outright acquisition, Google said it would pay $2.4 billion to hire its CEO and top talent, as well as license the company's intellectual property.\n\nThe deal effectively split Windsurf into two pieces, with the hundreds of remaining employees ending up at Cognition, another AI coding startup. That left some with a bitter taste.\n\nPart of the social contract in startups is that early employees work long hours at lower pay in the hope that they will share in the riches should their startup eventually get acquired or go public.\n\nNow, traditional acquisitions have become rarer because of the time and uncertainty of getting regulatory approval. As a result, companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have been getting creative, using licensing deals to skirt regulators and snap up key talent.\n\nSoftBank snapped up a private equity firm with the ultimate goal of controlling more of the physical infrastructure behind AI.\n\nOn Monday, SoftBank said it has entered into an agreement to acquire DigitalBridge, an alternative asset manager that invests in data centers, cell towers, fiber networks, and power that make the AI boom possible.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe deal comes as SoftBank reshuffles its portfolio. In November, the company said it had sold nearly $6 billion of Nvidia stock to free up cash for OpenAI. SoftBank is also doubling down on \"physical AI,\" building a robotics beachhead with a dedicated investment arm and a pending deal to buy ABB's robotics business.\n\nThe Trump administration agreed to take a 9.9% stake in Intel in August. It was a rare moment when Washington wasn't just regulating an industry or subsidizing it, but buying into it.\n\nUnder the terms Intel disclosed, the government will invest $8.9 billion for 433.3 million shares, and the stake is to be passive, with no board seat.\n\nThe investment aims to bolster domestic capacity for designing and manufacturing advanced chips. Intel has seen foreign competitors, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, cut into its market share of advanced chips. The White House has said it is a national security risk if industries continue to import the vast majority of advanced chips from overseas.\n\nThis also likely won't be the last deal of its kind. President Donald Trump and top aides have floated the idea of doing similar deals with American defense contractors and have considered a sovereign wealth fund.\n\nOne of the year's biggest deals sparked the question: Was Meta really spending $14 billion to hire a 28-year-old?\n\nAlexandr Wang cofounded and ran Scale AI, the data-labeling company that helps enterprises train and deploy AI models by supplying high-quality training data and tooling. In June, Meta agreed to pay $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI — and, just as importantly, to bring Wang in to lead its next act in AI.\n\nWang became Meta's chief AI officer and the public face of its superintelligence push, with a mandate that goes well beyond building better chatbots. His job is to convince elite researchers that Meta is the place to do their life's work — and to turn the company's key advantage, its compute budget, into a lasting edge.\n\nWhen Google agreed to buy Israeli-American cloud security firm Wiz earlier this year, it threw a $32 billion bucket of water on the idea that the mega-deal drought would persist.\n\nIn March, Google agreed to acquire the startup at an all-cash price roughly equal to Iceland's gross domestic product last year, pending regulatory sign-off. This marks the search giant's largest acquisition.\n\nThe acquisition served as an early litmus test of the Trump administration's willingness to greenlight pricey Big Tech mergers and acquisitions. The deal passed an antitrust review by the Department of Justice in November, clearing a key hurdle to closing.\n\nTrump kicked off his second term by unveiling a joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build a chain of data centers across the US — a project called Stargate that aims to invest $500 billion in domestic infrastructure by 2029.\n\nIn Abilene, Texas, a flagship data center has already opened. Construction crews have broken ground on Stargate sites in Lordstown, Ohio, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, with several more campuses to come.\n\nTo make the ongoing buildout a success, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has estimated it could take one-fifth of the nation's existing skilled trade workforce.",

    "title": "8 things to pack for a Disney vacation and 3 to leave behind, from a travel planner who's visited the parks over 40 times",
    "description": "As a frequent Disney World visitor and travel planner, there are things I always pack to survive park days, such as ponchos, plus some I never bring.",
    "fullText": "After going to Disney World over 40 times, I've gotten really good at visiting the parks — especially when it comes to optimizing the space in my suitcase.\n\nI'm also a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels specializing in Disney destinations, so my clients often ask me about the most important items to pack for a trip to the parks.\n\nRead on for the essentials I always bring, as well as the things I think you can leave at home.\n\nIf you've spent any time in the Orlando area, you know it will likely rain during your Disney trip.\n\nDon't let that stop you from having fun — just throw on rain ponchos and hit the parks. It's often much cheaper to buy them before you leave rather than inside Disney World.\n\nYou can also wear ponchos if you don't want to get wet on rides like Splash Mountain and Kali River Rapids.\n\nI've tried out every kind of bag you can imagine when visiting the parks. Ultimately, my biggest advice is to bring something small that fits your main essentials.\n\nMy husband's favorite is a cross-body bag, and I love a small backpack, purse, or fanny pack.\n\nYou want something that's easy to take on and off quickly, compact enough to take on rides, and roomy enough that you're not cramming your phone and necessities in.\n\nWhen you head to the parks, you want to travel light, so I like having smaller versions of essentials to carry.\n\nI raid the travel section of my local store before every trip to make sure I have sunscreen, hand sanitizer, aloe-vera gel, sanitizing wipes, a mini first-aid kit, pain relievers, and tissues.\n\nIt's not a Disney trip without the quintessential Mickey or Minnie ears. At this point, I have plenty to choose from based on different seasons, holidays, and moods.\n\nI also pack some of my many Disney T-shirts — one for each day at the parks. We always get one special matching family shirt for each trip, as well.\n\nThis way, we can stay on theme without feeling tempted to spend money on more merchandise while in the parks.\n\nA lot of planning in the parks requires the use of the My Disney Experience app, which is crucial for tasks like checking maps or making dining reservations. Plus, we love snapping lots of photos.\n\nVisiting Disney involves a lot of walking — on many days in the parks, I log over 10 miles. Also, because of frequent rain and water rides, my shoes often get wet.\n\nSo, I bring comfortable, fast-drying shoes to ensure my experience isn't ruined by blisters or sore feet. My husband always wears his Keen sandals, and I switch between my Sanuks and Tevas.\n\nMy family has made it a tradition to send a letter or postcard to someone back home from inside the parks.\n\nYou can always bring souvenir postcards to the front desk of your resort. However, it's more fun to put it in one of the four mailboxes on Main Street USA at Magic Kingdom.\n\nYou can pay for almost everything at Disney World with Disney gift cards, including dining, merchandise, and resort charges.\n\nMany external retailers offer small discounts when you purchase these cards, so buying them ahead of time is a great way to save a little money on your vacation.\n\nTo curb excess spending, we give each of our kids a gift card at the beginning of the trip for souvenirs. Once they use up their card's balance, they're done spending.\n\nAside from Victoria and Albert's at the Grand Floridian Resort, none of the Disney dining locations really expect more than casual dress.\n\nI love this aspect of Disney World because it means there are wonderful dining options with upscale-feeling food that are still super family-friendly.\n\nMy husband and I usually throw one nicer casual outfit in our suitcase if we decide we want to get a little fancy. But, generally, our dress clothes get left in the closet at home.\n\nMy clients often ask me if they need to bring life jackets or towels for their children to enjoy the hotel pools. Fortunately, the answer is no.\n\nAll the Disney resorts provide these items, so you can save space in your suitcase and leave them at home.\n\nIt's nice to have a few quick snacks on hand in the hotel room or in your park bag, but don't waste space in your suitcase. You can have groceries delivered to your Disney resort.\n\nMost national delivery services are available, or Garden Grocer is a local option. These deliveries can be picked up in the lobby at no charge or sent straight to your room for a small fee.\n\nThis story was originally published in January 2022 and most recently updated on December 29, 2025.",

    "title": "Streamers like Disney+ and HBO Max have a key problem with no clear solution",
    "description": "Free streamers like YouTube have gained viewers, while growth at paid services like Disney+ and Netflix has slowed.",
    "fullText": "Free streaming services are having success, and it may be coming at the expense of their paid peers.\n\nYouTube and other free ad-supported services, such as The Roku Channel and Fox-owned Tubi, have become increasingly popular over the last two years, according to Nielsen's viewership data.\n\n\"For consumers, cost sensitivity is often a more important deciding factor than user experience,\" said Brandon Katz, a media analyst at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics. \"Saving money outweighs the annoyance of terrible insurance commercials.\"\n\nAs these free streamers eat up a larger chunk of viewership time on US smart TVs, they may be holding back the growth of services like Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max.\n\nFree-to-access services YouTube, Tubi, and The Roku Channel have grown their viewership by 53% from December 2023 through November, according to a Business Insider analysis of Nielsen data. Those three free streamers make up nearly 18% of all watch time on US TVs, and that doesn't include Paramount's Pluto TV, which Nielsen broke out individually until March.\n\nIn that span, major paid streamers' collective watch time is only up 5%. That includes Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, Peacock, and HBO Max, formerly known as Max. (Paramount+ was included until March, when Nielsen stopped reporting its individual share. And HBO Max's viewership includes sister streamer Discovery+.)\n\nThat means free streamers are growing more than 10 times faster than their paid counterparts, though the bulk of that growth is driven by YouTube, which has become a force in Hollywood.\n\nSlower engagement growth is a troubling sign for paid streamers. Viewership is positively tied to pricing power and inversely correlated with cancellations, meaning that people who watch a streamer more often are less likely to cancel.\n\n\"Engagement drives churn down,\" said Hernan Lopez, founder of media consulting firm Owl & Co.\n\n\"It's not just about hours spent,\" he added, but also the frequency that viewers return to an app and the breadth of content that they watch.\n\nEngaged streaming subscribers are also usually more receptive to price hikes, Katz said, since they likely place a higher value on the service than inactive users.\n\n\"The goal is to offer customers enough attractive content that opening the app becomes a regular occurrence,\" Katz said. \"At that habitual usage point, streamers are able to reasonably raise prices without fear of a mass exodus of customers.\"\n\nFor customers on ad-supported plans, higher engagement also translates to more ad revenue.\n\nIt's not all bad news for paid streamers. Streaming is an increasingly profitable business, thanks in large part to price hikes, which every major service (except for Prime Video) has implemented or announced in the past 12 months.\n\nDisney+, Hulu, and HBO Max have also continued to add customers this year. However, Peacock hasn't grown its subscriber base since the first quarter of 2025, and Netflix no longer reports its subscriber count on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe large gap between free and paid streamer viewership growth rates suggests that so-called stream-flation could be taking a toll. Media giants must walk a tightrope between pleasing Wall Street and pushing consumers toward free streamers, or apps like Instagram and TikTok.\n\nStreaming giants Netflix and Disney each have creative ideas for driving engagement in 2026.\n\nNetflix is turning to video podcasts in hopes of adding lean-back content that keeps subscribers engaged throughout the day. It's also been trying to use games as a way to create daily habits among its users.\n\nDisney is taking a different tack by betting on AI-generated video through a new partnership with OpenAI. This AI initiative will enable fans to create short clips of Disney characters, such as Mickey Mouse or Darth Vader, eventually within the Disney+ app.",

    "description": "Lee Wan Yu, a former Disneyland parade dancer, shares a behind-the-scenes look at the audition process and what she learned from Disney's magic.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lee Wan Yu, 30, a Hong Kong Disneyland parade dancer turned freelance dance artist, teacher, and choreographer. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started dancing when I was three years old, after asking my mom for ballet lessons as we walked past a studio.\n\nFrom then on, all I wanted to do was dance. That love eventually led me somewhere I, as an introvert, never expected: Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nIt started in 2017, when Hong Kong Disneyland held an audition at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore, where I was studying for my diploma in dance.\n\nI went with a friend who didn't want to go alone. I had no expectations and just wanted to see how a professional audition works.\n\nAbout 50 dancers from the region participated in the audition.\n\nThey gave us a short jazz combination and had us perform it in small groups, cutting dancers until about 20 of us were left. They took our photos, measured our height, and recorded our body measurements.\n\nMonths later, while I was studying for my fine arts degree in New York, I was offered a standard one-year contract as a parade dancer at Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nWhen I arrived in May 2018, I realized I was the only Singaporean parade dancer at the time. The team included dancers from Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, and Thailand.\n\nA typical day started around 11 a.m. We had a warm-up class, followed by makeup and costumes.\n\nWe typically performed two parades a day, one in the afternoon and one at night, for about 30 minutes each. During festive seasons like Christmas, we could have up to four parades a day.\n\nIn the middle of each parade, we would stop in front of the castle for a short \"show stop\" to interact with guests.\n\nRehearsals for the Halloween parades sometimes ended around 2 a.m. because they took place after the park closed for the night.\n\nThe Hong Kong heat can be terrible, and the night-parade costumes had lights wired through and batteries attached. You could feel the weight pressing on your shoulders.\n\nSometimes I felt homesick or lonely, but once you're in costume, you have to bring your full energy.\n\nWhen you step into Disneyland, you should feel like you're transported to a different world — a place where you can disconnect, forget your problems for a while, and just be happy.\n\nThis is why guests would never see dancers working out during breaks, because Disney wanted to keep the illusion. We were also not allowed to take any backstage photos or videos.\n\nThe magic is the reason some guests come to every parade. There were adults who followed the route, taking photos, and kids who waved at us every day. I remember a teenage boy who came almost every weekend, dancing beside the route the whole time.\n\nSome of them recognized us outside the park without our costumes. Others gave us prints of photos they had taken of us.\n\nIt was more than just branding and the experience.\n\nAt Hong Kong Disneyland, everyone, from the dancers to the sound crew, respected one another. Even when people were tired, they were still polite. That attitude really stuck with me.\n\nI learned that how I treat people — not just the audience, but also my colleagues, the costume team, and the stage managers — really affects how smoothly everything runs and whether people want to be around you.\n\nOn the other side, Disney valued its performers. It was very serious about safety and well-being. We had good medical insurance, which is important for dancers.\n\nAfter one year, I decided not to re-audition for contract renewal. I wanted to explore new challenges.\n\nI'm now a freelance dancer, teacher, and choreographer in Singapore, where I try to infuse Disney's spirit of \"magic\" into my work.\n\nDance training can be stressful for kids, especially during exams or competitions, so I try to keep that sense of fun alive and create an environment where my students feel safe and excited to learn.\n\nThe magic is about creating that little moment in class where someone feels proud or inspired.\n\nI also try to bring that same magic into my choreography. AI plays a small part in helping me express my ideas.\n\nAs a choreographer, I often have to write synopses for school performances or competitions, and that part is difficult because dancers think in movement, not in sentences.\n\nRecently, I started using ChatGPT to help organize my ideas. I don't let it write for me, but I use it to structure what I already have and express my thoughts more clearly.\n\nI'm also open to trying AI software for large-scale productions with apps that can help with pinpoint formations, map things out, and visualise spacing.\n\nOver the past two years, I was a choreographer for Singapore's National Day Parade performances, overseeing close to 600 students for one of them. I remember spending weeks figuring out formations by hand, staying up until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., moving people around in Excel.\n\nIf AI could help with that, it would save so much time.\n\nBut technology can only assist — the emotion behind the movement still has to come from people.",

    "title": "I visited the 'Disney World' of truck stops for the sightseeing and food, but discovered a newfound respect for truckers",
    "description": "Iowa 80 in Walcott, Iowa stretches 150 football fields and serves 350,000 meals a year. It's more than just a stop on the road for truckers, though.",
    "fullText": "I've often driven past truckers feeling frustrated by their slow speed or uneasy that one might merge into my lane. I never gave much thought to who was behind the wheel.\n\nHowever, Iowa 80, the world's largest truck stop, cracked my heart open a bit.\n\nIowa 80's been dubbed the \"Disney World\" for truckers, but it's much more than its flashy signs, lines of semis, and large buffet. It's a home away from home for the people who move 70% — $13 trillion worth — of the goods Americans eat and buy.\n\nIowa 80 is a place where truckers can find some temporary peace, a shower, and even a dental exam. I was surprised to learn just how important a truck stop like this can be for people bound to the highways.\n\nIt sits along I-80 in Walcott, Iowa, and spans 225 acres. It has 900 parking spots, nine restaurants, 24 showers, and a massive chrome shop.\n\nIt's not in any world record books, though. After decades of folks saying, \"This has got to be the biggest truck stop in the world,\" the family behind Iowa 80 adopted the name. Now it's on dozens of signs around the property.\n\nIowa 80 is in a prime location, along one of America's busiest highways that connects New York City and Chicago to Des Moines and San Francisco. Plus, as the nation's top producer of corn and eggs, Iowa is a major agricultural shipping hub.\n\nWhat sets this truck stop apart, besides its size, is that it's one of the few mom-and-pop ones still around.\n\nOwned by the Moon family since 1964, Iowa 80 always has parking. Its main restaurant makes a surprising amount of food from scratch. It's a welcome change, truckers told me, from the big chains, like TA or Pilot, which often have full parking lots and fuel stations and only offer fast food to eat.\n\nI knew it was going to be big. But even I had underestimated the size. When I walked in, I thought, 'How on Earth am I going to see it all?'\n\nBig guys with their big gulps parted ways under the old-timey truck hanging over the entrance.\n\nWalking in, it felt like a shopping mall, complete with a food court filled with Orange Julius, Wendy's, and Taco Bell. On the right, the Iowa 80 Kitchen churned out homemade meals that were delicious.\n\nIt's no surprise they're working with a huge quantity of food. In their 61 years, they've gone through 23 million eggs. Bacon is one of the first things to hit the ovens each morning. The staff has to juggle both breakfast and lunch prep early to beat the rush.\n\nFor its size, I expected a lot of the food to be frozen. Indeed, the scrambled eggs and biscuits did arrive pre-cooked and frozen. However, most of the main dishes were cranked out by hand.\n\nChef Chris Han uses her grandfather's recipe for meatloaf, which includes chopped onions, celery, a tomato sauce mixture, breadcrumbs, and ground beef. She incorporates it all together in a 40-year-old mixer.\n\nThe cooks told me they tried to switch to pre-made ranch dressing, but there was an uproar among customers. So they went back to mixing it themselves. Mayo arrives in big buckets. That gets mixed with six gallons of buttermilk and nine packets of ranch seasoning.\n\nDiners have two options at Iowa 80 Kitchen. They can either pay for the buffet for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Or they can order off the expansive menu.\n\nThe Hungryman is a crowd favorite, with three kinds of meat, hash browns, eggs, and pancakes. When it hit my table, I couldn't believe people finish it.\n\nThese are sweet cream pancakes, which means they're made with heavy cream instead of milk or buttermilk. This swap felt like a brilliant indulgence to me.\n\nDespite sitting out for a bit while we took pictures, these pancakes had an incredible crisp on the outside. On the inside, they were still fluffy and almost gooey. I loved the unique tang to them.\n\nThis dish sang of Midwest comfort. I grew up a few hours south of Iowa 80, and it reminded me of my mom's recipe (I plead the fifth on which is better). It was warm, melty, and full of interesting textures, thanks to the breadcrumbs and celery.\n\nThe truckers I spoke to said that it's easy to get obese working as professional drivers. Most truck stops only have fast food options.\n\nThat's why Iowa 80 Kitchen means so much to them. It's a warm, home-cooked meal, they said. I wondered if that sentiment would excuse the few things that arrived frozen.\n\nLee Meier, granddaughter of the founders and the current marketing manager, took me on a tour of the massive truck stop. She explained that they wanted to include all these amenities — like 24 showers, a small gym, a laundry room, and a truck wash — so drivers wouldn't have to do errands in the precious hours they have at home with their families.\n\nWhen we poked our heads in around 2 p.m., there was no one in the 60-seat theatre. Disney's \"Cars\" played to an empty room.\n\nSeeing the movie selection gave me a jolt of excitement and nostalgia. It felt like I was a kid again, looking at that cool friend's massive collection of DVDs. I wanted more than anything to stay and cozy up to a movie.\n\nIt struck me that if a trucker has a toothache, they can't pull their rig into a neighborhood dentist. Which is why a dentist at a truck stop could be so valuable.\n\nI didn't get a chance to talk to the chiropractor, but Lee told me that many drivers experience back pain from being seated for 10 hours a day.\n\nTruckers can get new headlights, fenders, hood ornaments, seats, electronics, and horns. Iowa 80 also has a Truck Service Center that can repair any semi.\n\nAnd for drivers who might need inspiration for decorating their vehicle, there's even a trucking museum on the property, featuring over 100 antique rigs on display.\n\nDrivers told me that just to get some sleep, they have to fight for a parking spot at the most common truck stops, like TA and Pilot, but after 7 p.m. or 8 p.m., it's impossible to find one.\n\nThat's why you'll sometimes see rigs pulled over on the shoulder of a highway onramp to sleep, which can be unsafe if there's heavy traffic.\n\nEven with hundreds of trucks settled in by the time we left at 5 p.m., the lot was nowhere near full. I can see why this is an important feature for tired drivers.",

    "description": "The Disney musical was a box-office flop. Now, it's considered a treasure that helped launch Christian Bale's career. Here's what the cast is up to.",
    "fullText": "In 1992, Disney's movie musical \"Newsies\" made its debut — and it's since become quite a treasure.\n\nLoosely based on the true story of the 1899 newsboys' strike in New York City, the film features a crew of so-called newsies as they sing their way through oppression and fight for a fairer working system.\n\n\"Newsies\" was a box-office flop when it was first released, reportedly making less than $3 million at the box office, even though it cost over $15 million to make.\n\nBut in the years since, \"Newsies\" has built up a passionate group of \"fansies\" and has been adapted into a majorly successful Broadway musical. It has also helped launch the careers of a few young stars.\n\nHere's what the cast of \"Newsies\" is up to 33 years later:\n\nIn 1992, Christian Bale was 17 years old and had a few acting credits to his name until \"Newsies\" came along.\n\nBale portrayed the film's lead Jack Kelly, one of the ringleaders behind the newsies' strike.\n\nBale gave quite a performance singing, dancing, and acting as a rough, 19th-century Manhattan teen fending for himself and his chosen family.\n\n\"Newsies\" wouldn't be Bale's last Disney movie.\n\nHe'd later star in the early-1990s Disney flop \"Swing Kids,\" voice Thomas in 1995's \"Pocahontas,\" and voice Bagheera in 2019's \"Mowgli.\"\n\nOf course, the actor is perhaps most well known for his roles in \"American Psycho,\" \"Ford v Ferrari,\" and the \"Batman\" franchise — though he has starred in several other major movies since his \"Newsies\" days.\n\nDavid Moscow and Bale had undeniable synergy while starring alongside each other in \"Newsies.\"\n\nMoscow played David Jacobs, \"a mouth with a brain\" and a coleader in the fictionalized strike against Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst.\n\n\"Newsies\" might have been Moscow's first Disney musical, but the young star was no stranger to the big screen, having starred in Tom Hanks' \"Big\" just a few years prior.\n\nDecades after singing and dancing next to the future star of the \"Batman\" series, Moscow continues to leave a mark on Hollywood.\n\nHe appeared in 2003's \"Just Married\" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy and produced over a dozen movies.\n\nMoscow also appeared in 2017's \"This Is Christmas\" and \"One Last Night\" — but he's mostly been focusing on behind-the-scenes work.\n\nStarring as David Jacob's younger brother, Les, in the musical, Luke Edwards was no stranger to acting when he landed the role.\n\nBefore starring in \"Newsies,\" Edwards had several acting credits to his name, including a role in the cult-favorite '80s comedy \"The Wizard.\"\n\nEdwards has guest-starred on shows like \"Without a Trace\" and \"True Detective,\" though you might remember Edwards from \"American Pie 2\" or even \"Jeepers Creepers II.\"\n\nEdwards has also appeared in \"The Super,\" \"Adverse,\" and \"My Friend's Play.\"\n\nOne of the older \"Newsies\" in the bunch, Max Casella was 24 years old when he officially made his musical debut as Racetrack Higgins.\n\nAside from having a few TV roles in the 1980s and early 1990s, Casella had not appeared in a major theatrical production prior to this one.\n\nHe was, however, most well known as the time for his role as Vinnie Delpino on \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\"\n\nSince \"Newsies,\" Casella has gone on to make an impressive resume for himself.\n\nHe's lent his voice to characters in \"The Little Mermaid 2,\" \"Dinosaur,\" and \"Courage the Cowardly Dog.\" He has appeared in over two dozen \"Sopranos\" episodes, acted in \"Leatherheads,\" and joined \"Boardwalk Empire\" in 2010.\n\nI recent years, you might have spotted Casella in \"Jackie\" alongside Natalie Portman, or on episodes of \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and \"Tulsa King.\"\n\nAlthough he was only 15 years old when he starred as the spunky Brooklyn newsie Spot Conlon, Gabriel Damon was already quite a seasoned actor with over 30 credits to his name.\n\nNotably, he was the voice of Littlefoot in the fan-favorite animated film, \"The Land Before Time.\"\n\nAside from a few appearances on \"Baywatch\" and a few one-off roles on shows like \"ER\" and \"Sirens,\" Damon has shied away from the acting industry.\n\nHis last noted role was in a short in 2006.\n\n\"Newsies\" was Marty Belafsky's first-ever movie role.\n\nIn the musical, he appeared as the goofy but lovable Crutchy.  He was only 16 years old when \"Newsies\" was released.\n\nWhen he appeared as Boots in the 1992 musical drama, Arvie Lowe Jr. was a 12-year-old actor with no other roles to his name.\n\nAfter \"Newsies\" wrapped, Lowe Jr. found himself starring on popular 1990s shows like \"Sister, Sister,\" \"Moesha,\" and \"Smart Guy.\"\n\nHe even starred on the early aughts Disney Channel show \"Lizzie McGuire\" alongside Hilary Duff.\n\nSince then, he's had a few minor roles in Hollywood, and he's appeared in a few video shorts and commercials. Lowe Jr. is also a graphic designer.\n\nEle Keats had a few acting credits under her belt in Hollywood before landing the role of Sarah Jacobs in \"Newsies.\"\n\nShe played Jack Kelly's love interest, which led to backlash from fans who were unhappy about her kiss with Bale. Some have even referred to her character as the \"Destroyer of Dreams.\"\n\nSince starring in \"Newsies,\" Keats has had a number of small roles and has even guest-starred on shows like \"CSI,\" \"CSI: NY,\" and \"Cold Case.\"\n\nIn the last few years, she's made a name for herself in the horror-film industry, starring in \"Insidious: Chapter 3\" and \"Ouija: Origin of Evil.\"\n\nShe also owns Ele Keats Jewelry, which has a showroom in Santa Monica.\n\nActor Bill Pullman played one of the few redeeming adult characters \"Newsies\" had to offer.\n\nPreviously known for his work in \"Spaceballs,\" among other films, Pullman starred in the Disney musical as passionate journalist Bryan Denton.\n\nRobert Duvall was quite the villain in the musical, where he appeared as publishing mogul Joseph Pulitzer.\n\nPrior to \"Newsies,\" he acted in dozens of works — including \"The Godfather\" and \"The Twilight Zone.\"\n\nAfter \"Newsies,\" Duvall appeared in projects like \"The Apostle,\" \"Deep Impact,\" \"Gone in 60 Seconds,\" and \"Kicking and Screaming.\"\n\nHe continues to make a name for himself in Hollywood, and recently appeared in \"Widows,\" \"Hustle,\" and \"The Pale Blue Eye.\"\n\nCorrection: December 15, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Luke Edwards' first major role. It was in \"The Wizard,\" not \"Newsies.\"\n\nThis story was originally published in August 2018 and most recently updated on December 15, 2025.",

    "description": "Disney staffers spoke about the company's OpenAI deal and AI strategy, including AI tools they are using and one in development codenamed \"Jarvis.\"",
    "fullText": "Disney's billion-dollar OpenAI deal isn't the only way the company is embracing AI. In recent months, the Mouse House has been quietly adding new AI tools to its arsenal and encouraging staff to use them.\n\n\"They clearly see where things are headed,\" a longtime software engineer at Disney said. This marked a shift from this summer, when Disney had seemed \"hesitant to rely on AI tools,\" they said.\n\nDisney has given its employees access to several AI tools, including Microsoft Copilot and Amazon's Q Developer. Thanks to Disney's OpenAI deal, employees will also soon have access to the enterprise version of ChatGPT, the company said.\n\nThen there's a \"DisneyGPT\" chatbot that four staffers said helps with internal requests, such as creating IT support tickets, viewing the company roster, or analyzing a project's financials.\n\nIn an email sent to staff on October 2, Disney introduced the beta version of the chatbot, describing it as a \"new partner in productivity\" designed to help \"unlock the magic of your imagination.\" A December update enabled employees to upload Excel and PowerPoint files to the bot.\n\nDisneyGPT draws on signature Disney themes, with a prompt asking users if they're \"ready for an enchanting adventure\" and \"a verified collection of Walt Disney quotes\" that are \"tagged by themes like imagination, perseverance, and leadership,\" according to the chatbot's December update log. Otherwise, employees said DisneyGPT is mostly a standard AI chatbot.\n\nThere's also an AI chatbot in the works codenamed \"Jarvis,\" four employees said. Jarvis, named for the personal assistant \"J.A.R.V.I.S.\" from \"Iron Man,\" would be an agentic AI tool — more advanced than DisneyGPT — that completes tasks on an employee's behalf, a high-level staffer with direct knowledge of the company's AI efforts said. This person said Jarvis is in its early stages and is \"not fully baked.\"\n\n\"It's definitely something they want to push for everyone to lean into more,\" a Disney manager said of AI.\n\nCompanies in every industry are racing to adopt AI tools to boost productivity. Disney is going further than many, however. The OpenAI deal makes Disney the first major entertainment company to invest in the AI juggernaut, and allows its beloved characters to be used in the video generator Sora.\n\nThis reflects Disney's long tradition of merging innovation and entertainment, dating back to its founder, Walt.\n\nThree of the eight Disney employees who spoke with Business Insider expressed concerns about using AI, specifically that it could replace humans and threaten job security.\n\nThe high-level employee with direct knowledge of Disney's AI strategy said that while AI is a \"top priority,\" it isn't a cure-all. It can make mistakes and lacks a \"personalized touch\" that people provide, they said.\n\n\"If you use AI everywhere, it's going to be counterproductive,\" this person said, adding that tasks still need human creativity.\n\nDisney spokespeople didn't respond to several requests for comment on its internal AI efforts.\n\nOn an internal Disney website explaining its AI policy and tools, the company said it employs a \"responsible and human-centric approach to using AI.\"\n\n\"That means humans are, and will remain, the creative engine of the company,\" Disney said on the site. \"We believe, fundamentally, that human creativity and curiosity are immense and unique — and are at the heart of Disney.\"\n\n\"Simultaneously, our consistent embrace of new technologies has been a key part of empowering our creators and maintaining our leadership in creativity and innovation,\" the company continued in its \"Responsible AI Use\" section.\n\nSeven of the eight Disney staffers Business Insider interviewed have tried or regularly use DisneyGPT or Copilot, which is integrated into employees' email accounts and documents. Many use those AI tools for simple, routine tasks, like writing emails.\n\nDisney has a portal on its website that outlines its AI policy and lists Disney-approved AI tools. Two employees said the company has pointed staffers to AI education or compliance training courses.\n\nSome unsanctioned AI tools like Anthropic's Claude can be more effective than Disney-approved AI tools, three staffers said.\n\nOne employee at Disney-owned ESPN said their manager told them they could use personal accounts on non-approved AI chatbots for work.\n\n\"I'm just using a personal account because Disney isn't allowing us to use these tools yet,\" the ESPN employee said.\n\nThe staffer with direct knowledge of Disney's AI efforts said leadership had tried to make communications about AI \"clear across the board,\" but acknowledged that workers might not \"understand the implications\" of data security risks that could arise from using unsanctioned AI tools. Some staffers told Business Insider it was hard for them to keep up with the availability and restrictions on various AI tools.\n\nWhile some Disney employees expressed mixed feelings about AI, the more bullish among them said Disney was wise to strike a deal with OpenAI.\n\n\"This type of a partnership at least establishes the precedent for getting paid,\" the ESPN employee said.\n\nA Disney ads employee said they believed Disney's deal with OpenAI would \"pay off\" and \"be massive\" in five to 10 years, even if there are growing pains.\n\n\"Disney is smart to push into this,\" this staffer said. \"They are setting the rules of the game, or at least trying.\"",

OpenAI included screenshots of these kinds of videos in its press release, indicating how the two companies expect people to use the app’s new cast. Sora already allows users to generate videos that include their own likenesses.\n\nBob Iger, Disney’s CEO, said the licensing deal would place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”.\n\nThey may even offer a chance at wide viewership, with some fan-made videos being displayed on the Disney+ streaming service, a move seemingly designed to compete with TikTok’s and YouTube Shorts’ infinite feeds, which themselves often include clips of popular TV shows and movies.",

    "description": "Disney's OpenAI deal comes at a time when the stock is essentially flat over the past 10 years, while the S&P 500 has soared 236%.",
    "fullText": "Things Disney has accomplished in the past 10 years:\n\nThings it hasn't accomplished over the same period:\n\nThis may seem like a wild stat. After all, the S&P 500 is up a whopping 236% over the past decade. But it's true: Disney shares are basically dead flat during the stretch.\n\nFrom a market perspective, the last 10 years have been a total wash.\n\nThe chart above — which looks at Disney's stock versus the benchmark S&P 500 — shows that the key divergence happened in early 2021, which marked Disney's last record high.\n\nThe company has faced a few main headwinds since that top:\n\nAfter Disney+ got off to a fast start, user growth eventually stalled out and prolonged the service's winding path to profitability. The company has also grappled with ESPN's increasingly online audience in the era of cord-cutting, which has contributed to contentious negotiations with TV carriers. (To be fair, all legacy media companies are dealing with the same issues.)\n\nMissing the mark on original content\n\nPixar movies used to be an absolute slam dunk at the box office. No longer. Viewers are also getting fatigued by the constant stream of reboots and sequels. And yes, Disney still has Marvel and Star Wars, although those have lost steam as well. (Note that a similar slowdown has been seen for movie studios overall.)\n\nDisney has caught flak in recent years over the prices at its parks. CEO Bob Iger even admitted in 2023 that the company had been \"too aggressive\" with price hikes. While parks remain a source of relative strength for the company, their cost has left them vulnerable to downturns in consumer sentiment.\n\nWhich brings us to Disney's latest big swing: a $1 billion investment in OpenAI that will integrate iconic characters into the AI video platform Sora. It's notable that Disney is the first major non-tech company to partner with OpenAI.\n\nUpon first glance, the deal feels like a desperate move from a company that's underperformed for a long stretch. But analysts at Citi see it differently.\n\nJason Bazinet, who has a \"buy\" rating on Disney's stock, lauded it as a defensive move, intended to protect the value of the company's IP from cannibalization. He sees it helping to sustain long-term brand value, while also giving it long-term upside in AI. Iger made similar points in defense of the deal.\n\nWe'll see over time if this AI team-up is a catalyst for a grand stock comeback — and if it's a model other companies follow.",

    "fullText": "Mickey Mouse … brought to you by OpenAI.\n\nDisney lending out its iconic characters to be leveraged by AI seemed a far-fetched idea a few months ago. But thanks to a $1 billion deal between the House of Mouse and OpenAI, that's exactly what's happening.\n\nIt's representative of a larger question companies, especially those in media and entertainment, are grappling with: Are AI companies friend or foe?\n\nFor Bob Iger, the answer is very much friend.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,\" the Disney CEO told CNBC on Thursday.\n\nThe deal will allow Disney+ to post users' AI-generated content, a goal that Iger mentioned last month. Doing so could help boost engagement on the streamer's platform, which has been stagnant in recent years, writes BI's Lucia Moses.\n\n(I should probably mention Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, also falls in the \"friend\" camp. It cut a deal with OpenAI almost two years ago.)\n\nOthers aren't as willing to rub shoulders with OpenAI. The startup has a history of using someone's intellectual property without permission and then apologizing for it. That has resulted in several lawsuits, including those from The New York Times and \"Game of Thrones\" author George R.R. Martin.\n\nSo who's right? It's too early to say, but it could easily go both ways.\n\nThe longer one waits to cut a deal with an AI company, the worse the terms could be. (The benefits of first-mover advantage.) On the other hand, opening yourself up to AI could be a kind of Pandora's box you can't close.\n\nHere's what some smart people in media, tech, and business are saying about the deal.\n\nThe deal isn't just beneficial to Disney.\n\nDisney characters coming to Sora 2 could be a big boost for a video platform that hit a bit of a lull after a hot start a few months ago.\n\nBringing characters from \"Frozen\" and \"Moana\" to life on your app is also a great way to generate interest and build loyalty with a younger audience. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently touted the personal benefits he finds from using ChatGPT as a new parent.\n\nBut pursuing a younger demographic also comes as some countries are putting up more guardrails around kids' use of tech. Australia recently installed a ban on social media for anyone under the age of 16.\n\nThe Disney-OpenAI deal also comes as competition keeps mounting against the startup from the likes of Google and others. And while so much of AI is about pushing cutting-edge tech, sometimes you just need a little bit of old-school magic.",

    "description": "OpenAI said Thursday it had struck a licensing agreement to use Disney's characters and other intellectual property.",
    "fullText": "It's likely just a matter of time before we see the wisened duo of Rafiki and Jiminy Cricket weilding lightsabers on the icy plains of Arendelle.\n\nThat's courtesy of artificial intelligence, of course, and a new deal between Disney and OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI said Thursday it had struck a licensing agreement to use Disney's characters and other intellectual property. Disney will also invest $1 billion in OpenAI and will purchase ChatGPT Enterprise for its employees.\n\nIt's a major shift for Disney, which has historically been deeply protective of its intellectual property. And it's a big win for OpenAI, which is on a quest for more content to feed its AI models.\n\nFor users, the deal will enable them to recreate Disney characters on Sora, OpenAI's short-form video generation app, and to create images of Disney characters using ChatGPT.\n\nBeyond the limitless possibilities for creative content, the deal reveals a lot about Disney's strategy in the AI age and the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of entertainment.\n\nHere's what some smart people in media, tech, and business are saying about the deal.\n\nFor Nick Cicero, the founder of Delmondo, a social media video analytics company that was acquired by Conviva in 2018, Disney's deal with OpenAI is less about AI and more about revenue.\n\nCicero argued in an X post on Thursday that Disney was aiming to solve two \"existential\" problems: creators using unauthorized Disney content and kids watching YouTube instead of Disney+.\n\n\"Sora gives Disney its first scalable way to pull creator-made content into its own premium ecosystem — brand-safe, trackable, legal, and ready for CTV monetization,\" he said, referring to the practice of delivering targeted advertising to internet-connected televisions.\n\n\"This move isn't about tech,\" he added. \"It's about revenue physics.\"\n\nChatbots like ChatGPT rely on data to power their outputs, and when it comes to collecting that data, AI companies are insatiable.\n\nThe drive to collect data often pits AI companies against content creators. Numerous media companies have sued OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and other leading AI outfits for using their copyrighted content without permission. Other media companies, like Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, have struck deals with AI companies to license their content.\n\nPeter Csathy, a longtime media consultant and analyst, said Disney's deal with OpenAI is a \"watershed\" moment for AI and media licensing.\n\n\"Now THIS is a generative AI use that makes sense to me and I support,\" Csathy wrote on LinkedIn. \"Fully licensed characters, thereby respecting copyright and embracing partnership with the creative community (rather than theft of IP). New revenue streams for IP rights-holders. And overall delight by fans of those beloved characters.\"\n\nThere are just so many cease-and-desist letters a media lawyer can send.\n\nCarline Giegerich, a vice president at the Interactive Advertising Bureau who once led emerging tech at HBO, says Disney's deal with OpenAI feels like a \"can't beat 'em, join 'em\" moment.\n\n\"When I was at HBO from '05 - '09, I marveled at the sheer volume of cease and desists from the legal team when mobile video was up and coming,\" she wrote on LinkedIn. \"I thought it seemed difficult to fight against the entire internet, and it turns out it was. And AI presents a similar challenge.\"\n\nShe also said the deal presents a valuable marketing opportunity for Disney.\n\n\"Important to note that a selection of these fan-created videos will be available to stream on Disney+. What that means to me is that Disney sees this also as a marketing and content opportunity, which it is,\" she said.\n\nDisney's pivot from aggressively defending its IP at every turn to giving it over to the world's leading AI startup might be strategic for another reason.\n\nJames Miller, the head of business development at Amazon for media, entertainment, and Amazon Creators, said he suspects it's a matter of \"controlling the inevitable.\"\n\nAny IP eventually enters the public domain. In 2024, the copyright for Mickey Mouse himself — at least the sans white gloves version of the 1930s — expired, allowing anyone to use his likeness. Winnie the Pooh, Snow White, Cinderella, and a handful of other Disney characters also entered the public domain at the same time.\n\n\"By officially licensing these characters now, Disney does three things,\" Miller wrote on LinkedIn. \"1. Monetizes the AI trend rather than just fighting it in court. 2. Sets the quality standard for how their characters appear in AI video (likely drowning out lower-quality unauthorized versions). 3. Captures data on how fans want to use their IP before they lose exclusive rights.\"\n\nOne consumer expert said that Disney might have gotten the short end of the stick in this partnership.\n\n\"Looks like OpenAI used the #jedimindwarp on The Walt Disney Company, not the other way around,\" Karl Haller, an IBM partner and the leader of the firm's Consumer Center of Competency, said in a post on LinkedIn.\n\nHe said he was \"more than a bit surprised\" to see that Disney is letting OpenAI license its IP for Sora and other AI tools, with some of the videos being made available to stream on Disney+.\n\n\"And what does Disney receive for this? Negative $1 billion,\" he wrote. \"Rather than receiving a heftly license fee, Disney is instead investing $1B in OpenAI and receiving warrants to buy \n\nOne entertainment lawyer pointed out that the deal comes with a lot of unanswered questions.\n\n\"This is a fairly stunning story all round with many questions,\" Simon Pullman, a partner at law firm Pryor Cashman, wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday.\n\n\"Will audiences want/accept 'AI UGC' on Disney Plus,\" he wrote, referring to user-generated content. \"Will it be possible for Disney to unring the bell after three years and not extend the license? How will they protect against misuse and brand damage?\"\n\nDisney's $1 billion bet on AI is the right move for the media giant, according to Mike Walsh, the CEO of consulting firm Tomorrow.\n\n\"By partnering with OpenAI while suing Midjourney and warning Google, Disney is drawing a clear line,\" Walsh wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday. \"Remix culture isn't going away, but it will be licensed, governed, and designed on its terms.\"\n\nHe added that Disney has always survived new media eras with this strategy.\n\n\"The future of entertainment belongs to companies that shape participation instead of fighting it,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "Disney faces an engagement problem as kids gravitate to YouTube. It's looking to OpenAI to help boost engagement.",
    "fullText": "Disney is losing the war for attention. Can its blockbuster OpenAI licensing deal change the momentum on the battlefield?\n\nSoon, you'll be able to use OpenAI products, such as ChatGPT and the video generator Sora, to create content featuring Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, and Darth Vader.\n\nCEO Bob Iger said the move would let Disney take advantage of a fast-growing area of entertainment.\n\nIger said initially Disney would \"curate some of the videos that have been created on the Sora platform and put them onto Disney+, which we think is a great way to increase engagement with our Disney+ users, particularly the younger users.\" Iger said eventually the company wants users to create AI videos within Disney+ itself.\n\nThere's a key word in Iger's comment that signals why Disney might be particularly motivated to make this deal: engagement.\n\nTime people spend on Disney's and other leading streaming services has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, while YouTube and social video have grown. Disney's share of US TV viewership for its streaming services — including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — has been stuck at around 4.8% this year, according to Nielsen. YouTube is the top streaming platform on TVs, with a nearly 13% share in October, and its lead has been widening.\n\nData from analytics firm Luminate showed that engagement with Disney+'s original content fell to a 3% share of US viewing time in the third quarter of 2025. That's down from 9% three years earlier, the largest decline among paid streamers.\n\nDisney has been highly protective of its famous characters and favors keeping people on its own platforms. This stance has made it difficult for the company to capitalize on the rise of user-generated content. And it's losing its monopoly on its core constituency, kids, as they increasingly watch YouTube over Disney+.\n\nTraditional media companies are struggling to grow, so they're trying to figure out new ways to get people to engage with their content, whether it be games, live events, or fan content creation, media analyst Doug Shapiro, a senior advisor at BCG, recently told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse,\" he said. \"I think they're all asking themselves, how can they have a deeper relationship with fans?\"\n\nDisney invested $1.5 billion in Fortnite maker Epic Games last year and struck a deal with Webtoon to create a new digital platform for Disney's comics, including Marvel and Star Wars. Outside Disney, Netflix is opening Netflix Houses, mini theme parks in malls that let people enter the worlds of its popular shows. Amazon has backed Fable Studios, a startup that has an AI streaming platform that lets users make their own shows and play with existing IP.\n\nJohn Attanasio, CEO of Toonstar, a tech-driven animation studio, said Disney's IP is so popular that the Sora videos could help drive more audience. He thought Disney could potentially charge for access to AI tools on Disney+ or use the Sora videos to discover franchise extensions.\n\n\"UGC, when it's so specific, the reach is limited,\" he said. \"But when you use known IP, that expands the potential audience.\"\n\nDisney fans and Hollywood insiders had mixed reactions to the OpenAI news.\n\nShae Noble, a Disney superfan in her late 30s, said she could see herself sending birthday messages or making fan videos of the characters interacting in interesting ways — especially if it were integrated into Disney+.\n\n\"I've already seen some of the negative impacts of AI and people pushing it too far to create harmful images,\" she added. \"So it's smart of them to be proactive about it.\"\n\nSome in Hollywood worried about the risks to professional creators.\n\nFor one thing, the deal puts the emphasis on existing IP rather than making new content, Toonstar's Attanasio said.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America came out swinging against the deal, and said it planned to meet with Disney to explore how much the pact would let user-generated videos use the work of its members.\n\nSam Tung, a storyboard artist and cochair of the Animation Guild's AI committee, wondered if OpenAI's guardrails would be strong enough to protect Disney's IP, recalling a widely publicized incident earlier this year when Fortnite users used AI to make the Darth Vader character swear. He also doubted the UGC would move the needle on engagement.\n\n\"I think what audiences want is high-quality stuff to watch with your family,\" Tung said.\n\nJames Faris contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "Agreement comes amid anxiety in Hollywood over impact of AI on the industry, expression and rights of creators\n\nWalt Disney has announced a $1bn equity investment in OpenAI, enabling the AI startup’s Sora video generation tool to use its characters.\n\nUsers of Sora will be able to generate short, user-prompted social videos that draw on more than 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars characters as part of a three-year licensing agreement between OpenAI and the entertainment giant.\n\nThe agreement – a landmark deal amid intense anxiety in Hollywood over the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of entertainment – will not cover talent likenesses or voices.\n\nBob Iger, Disney’s CEO, hailed a deal which paired his firm’s “iconic stories and characters” with OpenAI’s AI technology. It will place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”, he claimed.\n\nThe deal is OpenAI’s most prominent move into Hollywood after a contentious rollout of Sora and longstanding pushback against AI from many entertainment industry workers. Concerns from writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives over AI replacing jobs and using likenesses without consent has led to union protests and copyright lawsuits against AI companies.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched its latest iteration of Sora earlier this year, it immediately ran into a slew of potential copyright issues, as feeds became dominated by videos featuring characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants or Pikachu – sometimes generated to appear in Nazi-like clothing.\n\nRacist depictions of Martin Luther King Jr prompted OpenAI to ban the use of his likeness on the platform, while the daughter of Malcolm X called seeing her father’s image on Sora “deeply disrespectful and hurtful”.\n\nDisney itself has also been concerned over the unauthorized use of its characters by generative AI platforms. The company sent a stern cease-and-desist letter to the Character.AI chatbot firm in October, alleging that the platform was “blatantly infringing on Disney’s copyrights” through using the likeness of its characters.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, attorneys representing Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, demanding that the technology company’s AI systems stop alleged infringement, Variety reported.\n\nThe OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, has been on a charm offensive that included a recent appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, the US talkshow. On Thursday, he touted the firm’s deal with Disney as proof that artificial intelligence companies could partner with the entertainment sector.\n\n“This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences,” Altman said.\n\nIn addition to Disney letting its characters appear in Sora, the company will also use OpenAI’s application programming interfaces to build new products and tools, becoming a major customer of the ChatGPT maker. A selection of the videos made by users on Sora will also be available for streaming on the Disney+ platform. It will also deploy ChatGPT for its employees, the companies said.\n\n“Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world,” said Iger. “The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”",

    "description": "Darth Vader and other Disney characters are coming to ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora AI video app as part of a three-year licensing deal.",
    "fullText": "Darth Vader is coming to ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora AI video app.\n\nThe House of Mouse and OpenAI struck a three-year licensing agreement on Thursday to make Disney \"the first major content licensing partner on Sora.\"\n\nIt's also investing $1 billion into the AI pioneer and receiving warrants to purchase additional equity.\n\nShares of Disney climbed over 2% after the opening bell.\n\n\"As part of this new, three-year licensing agreement, Sora will be able to generate short, user-prompted social videos that can be viewed and shared by fans, drawing from a set of more than 200 animated, masked and creature characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars, including costumes, props, vehicles, and iconic environments,\" OpenAI said in a Thursday announcement.\n\nIn addition to striking a licensing deal, Disney is also becoming a \"major customer\" of the AI company, according to the announcement, and buying ChatGPT enterprise licenses for its employees.\n\nWhile Sora, OpenAI's TikTok-like AI video app, has been generating buzz and downloads since its launch earlier this year, users of the company's more popular product, ChatGPT, will also have access to AI versions of Disney's characters as part of the deal.\n\nThe AI-generated Disney characters will be available starting in early 2026.\n\nThe move is likely to prove controversial in Hollywood, where many actors have publicly voiced concern about AI use and concerns over how their likeness is used. Disney and OpenAI stated that \"the agreement does not include any talent likenesses or voices.\"\n\nCreators are core to Disney, and its CEO Bob Iger stressed that the deal represented no threat to creators.\n\n\"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license to be associated with it,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Thursday.\n\n\"The other thing it does is it enables us to be comfortable that Open AI is putting guardrails essentially around how these are used, so that really there's nothing for us to be concerned about from a consumer perspective, meaning this will be a safe environment and a safe way for consumers to engage with our founders in a new way,\" he added.\n\nIger hinted at such a transaction during the company's most recent earnings call, making extensive comments about the potential he sees for AI to enhance Disney's direct-to-consumer strategy. He said the company was having extensive talks with AI companies to protect its IP as well as generate more engagement with users.\n\nHis comments demonstrate how Disney — like other Hollywood players — is looking for new ways for people to interact with its platforms and brands as user-generated content platforms and independent creators gain popularity.\n\nDisney, like those other players, has an engagement problem. The time people spend on streaming has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, despite increased spending on content, while YouTube has grown. The bet with AI is that it can get people to spend more time on its platforms by giving them more ways to play around with its famous franchises.\n\nThe companies hinted as much in the announcement, saying that they would \"collaborate to utilize OpenAI's models to power new experiences for Disney + subscribers.\"\n\nDisney is also wary of the tech's risk to its IP. In June, Disney, along with Comcast's NBCUniversal studio business, sued AI company Midjourney, claiming its tech created unauthorized copies of works ranging from Star Wars to The Simpsons. Midjourney denied the claims in its legal response. The suit is ongoing.\n\nDisney's $1 billion cash infusion comes at a critical time for OpenAI, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly $1.4 trillion the AI company has pledged to spend over the next eight years on data centers.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously said that large rights holders would ultimately welcome their content being used on Sora, provided it was done with proper guardrails in place. His comments came after OpenAI stepped up restrictions on the Sora app in the wake of viral user-generated videos depicting SpongeBob as Walter White and Pikachu in \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\n\n\"Most of the rights holders that I've spoken to are actually extremely excited to get their content in here,\" Altman told tech analyst Ben Thompson in October. \"They just want to be able to set more restrictions than they would need for images because videos feel different.\"",

    "title": "Disney CEO Bob Iger explains why he just did a blockbuster OpenAI deal",
    "description": "Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company's licensing deal with OpenAI will let it capitalize on a fast-growing technology and engage younger audiences.",
    "fullText": "Disney CEO Bob Iger says his company's major licensing deal with OpenAI is all about establishing a foothold in a new realm of entertainment and engaging younger audiences.\n\nThe licensing agreement gives ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora video platform access to Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Darth Vader. Disney is also investing $1 billion in the AI company and becoming a \"major customer.\"\n\nSpeaking on CNBC about the deal with OpenAI's Sam Altman on Thursday, Iger said it gives Disney a chance to get in on a fast-growing area of tech.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,\" Iger said.\n\nIger said the deal also fulfills a longtime desire by Disney to put user-generated content on its Disney+ streaming platform. Disney initially plans to put select videos created on Sora onto Disney+ to increase engagement with users, especially younger ones. Ultimately, Iger wants to let Disney+ users create such videos within the platform itself.\n\n\"That's a big step for us,\" he said.\n\nDisney has long been highly protective of its famous characters and storylines, and Iger is widely seen in Hollywood as a champion of the creative set. But like other entertainment players, Disney has an engagement problem. The time people spend on streaming has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, despite increased spending on content. Social media and user-generated content, in contrast, continue to rise. The bet with OpenAI is that the deal can get people to spend more time on Disney platforms by giving them new ways to play around with its famous franchises.\n\nIger has long positioned the company as pro-technology, and he said, in reference to the OpenAI deal, that he'd rather participate in technological innovation than be disrupted by it.\n\n\"We think this is actually a way for us to be part of these developments, as opposed to being harmed by them,\" he said.\n\nIger said the deal is also a way for Disney to participate in the big rise in user-generated short-form video on social-media platforms.\n\nAltman said Thursday that the demand for Disney characters, in particular, is \"off the charts\" on OpenAI's products. He said he sees the deal enabling people to do things like putting themselves in a lightsaber scene from \"Star Wars\" or creating a custom birthday video for their kid using the Buzz Lightyear character.\n\nAI firms have been \"frenemies\" to media companies, as many in Hollywood are concerned about how they use copyrighted material and the threat that they could pose to the creative process. Iger said the OpenAI deal is good for creators rather than a threat.\n\n\"This does not in any way represent a threat to the creators at all. In fact, the opposite,\" Iger said. \"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license to be associated with it.\"\n\nDisney said the agreement does not include any talent likeness or voices and that OpenAI would have guardrails in place to make sure Disney's IP was used in a safe way.\n\nIn June, Disney, along with Comcast's NBCUniversal studio business, sued AI company Midjourney, claiming its tech created unauthorized copies of works ranging from Star Wars to The Simpsons. Midjourney denied the claims in its legal response. That suit is ongoing.",

    "title": "Disney Will Now Let You Make AI Slop of Its Characters on Sora",
    "description": "Disney is literally paying $1 billion for this.",
    "fullText": "If you've engaged in any sort of doomscrolling over the past year, you've no doubt encountered some wild AI-generated content. While there are plenty of AI video generators out there producing this stuff, one of the most prevalent is OpenAI's Sora, which is particularly adept at generating realistic short-form videos mimicking the content you might find on TikTok or Instagram Reels. These videos can be so convincing at first glance, that people often don't realize what they're seeing is 100% fake. That can be harmless when it's videos of cats playing instruments at midnight, but dangerous when impersonating real people or properties.\n\nIt's that last point that I thought would offer some pushback to AI's seemingly exponential growth. These companies have trained their AI models on huge amounts of data, much of which is copyrighted, which means that people are able to generate images and videos of iconic characters like Pikachu, Superman, and Darth Vader. The big AI generators put guardrails on their platforms to try to prevent videos that infringe on copyright, but people find a way around them. As such, corporations have already started suing OpenAI, Google, and other AI companies over this blatant IP theft. (Disclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April 2025, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\n\nBut it seems not all companies want to go down this path. Take Disney, as a prime example. On Thursday, OpenAI announced that it had made a three-year licensing agreement with the company behind Mickey Mouse. As part of the deal, Sora users can now generate videos featuring over 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars characters. The announcement names the following characters and movies specifically:\n\nThat includes licensed costumes, props, vehicles, and environments. What's more, Disney+ will host a \"selection\" of these \"fan-inspired\" Sora videos. (I'll admit, that last point genuinely shocks me.) This does only apply to Disney's visual assets, however, as Sora users won't have access to voice acting. ChatGPT users will also be able to generate images with these characters, so this news doesn't just affect Sora users.\n\nYou might think OpenAI is paying Disney a hefty licensing fee here, but it appears to be quite the opposite. Not only is Disney pledging to use OpenAI APIs to build \"products, tools, and experiences,\" it is rolling out ChatGPT to its employees as well. Oh, and the company is making a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI. (Is that all?)\n\nI know many companies are embracing AI, often in ways I disagree with. But this deal is something else entirely. I'm not sure any Disney executives actually searched for \"Sora Disney\" on the internet, because right now, you'll find fake AI trailers for Pixar movies filled with racism, sexual content, and generally offensive content—all generated using an app Disney just licensed all of its properties to. OpenAI asserts in its announcement that both companies are committed to preventing \"illegal or harmful\" content on the platform, but Sora users are already creating harmful content. What kind of content can we expect with carte blanch access to Disney's properties?\n\nNow that Disney's characters are fair game, I can't imagine the absolute slop that some users are going to make here. The only hope I have is in the fact that Disney+ is going to host some of these videos. Staff will have to weed through some garbage to find videos that are actually suitable for the platform. And maybe seeing the \"content\" that Sora users like to make with iconic characters will be enough for Disney to rethink its plans.",

    "description": "YouTube TV will offer a cheaper sports-focused package in 2026, which it can offer after tough negotiations with Disney and other media companies.",
    "fullText": "YouTube TV will unveil new prices soon. But this time, it will be good news for sports fans.\n\nYouTube is launching a set of cheaper, slimmed-down versions of its popular live TV service in 2026, which it's calling \"YouTube TV Plans,\" the video giant announced on Wednesday. One of the new plans will be a sports bundle that provides access to ESPN Unlimited, FS1, and NBC Sports Network.\n\nWhile YouTube TV isn't yet revealing pricing for these 10 or so genre-specific packages, they'll cost less than the Google-owned service's typical rate, which is $83 a month.\n\n\"Our goal is to let you tailor your subscription with more options,\" said Christian Oestlien, YouTube's head of subscriptions, in a statement. \"Whether you stick with our main YouTube TV plan with 100+ channels, focus on sports, combine sports and news, or select a plan centered on family or entertainment content, subscribers will be able to easily choose the plan that works best for them.\"\n\nYouTube TV secured the rights to form these so-called \"skinny bundles\" after hard-fought negotiations with Disney, Comcast's NBC, and Fox. YouTube TV's battle with Disney was especially intense, as it left subscribers without ESPN and ABC for 15 days.\n\nJustin Connolly, YouTube's global head of media and sports, said at a media event on Tuesday night that YouTube worked with its partners on \"ingesting the entirety of the sports programming\" in its service, so that YouTube TV can be a one-stop shop for sports fans. Besides aggregating live games, Connolly said YouTube is being fan-friendly by aiming to \"meet the consumer where they are\" on price.\n\nYouTube TV's price has steadily increased since it launched in 2017 at $35, though it's also added more channels. Last December, YouTube TV's monthly price rose by $10.\n\nOther TV providers have launched sports-focused skinny bundles, with some tradeoffs.\n\nFubo's $55.99 a month Sports + News bundle includes all of ESPN and Fox's channels, plus CBS and the NFL Network, but it doesn't have NBC or Warner Bros. Discovery's networks like TNT or TruTV. It also doesn't have the news networks CNN and MS Now (formerly MSNBC), though it has Fox News.\n\nSling TV's Orange & Blue bundle goes for $60.99 and has ESPN, Fox with cable sidekick FS1, WBD's channels like TNT and CNN, and the NFL Network. It also carries local channels like NBC and ABC in certain markets. But Sling doesn't have a deal with CBS, plus its main bundle doesn't include specialty sports networks like the SEC Network, the Big Ten Network, or NBA TV. Sling offers a Sports Extra add-on for $15 a month on its main plan, bringing the total to $76.\n\nDirecTV's MySports package costs $69.99 but is more comprehensive, with the full suites of ESPN, Fox, and WBD, plus all four major local broadcast networks: ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox (with possible exceptions in certain markets). It also carries the flagship networks for four major US sports: the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL.\n\nSports fans could complement those skinny bundles by buying a digital antenna or by using streaming services like Peacock or Paramount+ that give access to NBC and CBS, respectively.\n\nESPN also offers a subscription to its entire suite for $29.99 a month, or a bundle with competing streamer Fox One for $39.99 a month.\n\nYouTube said its new sports plan will have ESPN's full suite of programming plus sports channels from Fox and NBC, with the option to add on NFL Sunday Ticket and RedZone for more money. Otherwise, it's unclear exactly which channels this bundle will have.\n\nAs YouTube TV's sports bundle enters the market, sports fans have more choices than ever. The challenge for them now is finding the right plan.",

    "description": "Former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer predicts \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros. between Netflix and Paramount.",
    "fullText": "A former Disney executive who oversaw its dealmaking expects \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer\" from Netflix, Paramount Skydance, or both, said Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, on Tuesday at the UBS media conference.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion, including debt. Paramount Skydance then launched a hostile offer, saying on Monday that it's willing to pay $108.4 billion for the whole firm, including the TV networks like CNN and HGTV. Executives at Netflix and Paramount CEO David Ellison have each framed their offers as the best for employees, Hollywood, WBD shareholders, and TV viewers. Both suitors also said they're confident they can pass regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMayer, now the co-CEO of Cocomelon owner Candle Media, said he thinks Paramount's hostile bid will reignite the faceoff for Warner Bros. and force the eventual winner to fork over more money.\n\n\"From the Warner Bros. Discovery perspective, this is nothing but good news,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer added: \"Does it move up another $5 billion or $10 billion? I think it probably does. That's what it's going to take to win it.\"\n\nMayer said the battle for Warner Bros. reminds him of the fight for control of 21st Century Fox between Disney and Comcast, which he was involved in during his tenure at the Mouse House.\n\nUnder Mayer, Disney agreed to buy Fox's studio, FX, and its stake in Hulu for $52.4 billion in equity, or $66.1 billion with debt, in December 2017. Six months later, cable giant Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash offer for those same assets. Disney ultimately won, but it was forced to pay a heftier price of $71.3 billion. Mayer helped engineer Disney's initial agreement with Fox, but had moved to a role atop Disney's streaming business by the time the acquisition closed.\n\n\"That was a difficult process,\" Mayer said of Comcast's bid for Fox. \"It added $19 billion to the price tag. Still a good deal, but not the exceptional deal that it was before we had to pay more.\"\n\nWhile Disney's deal with Fox gave it control over Hulu and bolstered its library, Disney activist investor Nelson Peltz argued that the Mouse House had shown \"poor judgment\" by \"overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets.\"\n\nAs Netflix and Paramount vie for Warner Bros., Mayer said the Disney-Comcast showdown \"points to where we might see this going.\"\n\nThat's because Ellison's $30-per-share hostile bid, which Paramount also sent to WBD's board, might not be rich enough, Mayer said.\n\n\"David Ellison has already kind of hinted at that, that he hasn't done his best and final yet, and I suspect he hasn't,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer was likely referencing a text message from Ellison to WBD CEO David Zaslav, which was made public as part of a Paramount filing on Monday: \"Please note importantly we did not include 'best and final' in our bid.\"\n\n\"The team at Paramount is aggressive,\" Mayer said. He pointed to the gargantuan amount of money that David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry, have at their disposal.\n\n\"I don't think there's a whole lot of hesitancy to spend it,\" Mayer said.",
