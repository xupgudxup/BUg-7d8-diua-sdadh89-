    "description": "President Donald Trump is raging privately at allies who called out his racist video post, according to CNN White House sources.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is raging privately at allies who called out his racist video post, according to CNN White House sources.\n\nTrump posted a video to his Truth Social account last week that contained an image depicting President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes:\n\nThe post drew widespread outrage including from Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), who called it “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”\n\nAfter 12 hours or so, the post was deleted, with an unnamed White House official claiming “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down.”\n\nBut a week later, Trump is back to defending it, and according to CNN’s Alayna Treene is out for revenge against Scott and others who called him out.\n\nOn Friday night’s edition of CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360, Treene told host Anderson Cooper that Trump is raging privately about Scott and Sen. Katie Britt ( for their perceived disloyalty:\n\nANDERSON COOPER: According to new reporting, there may be repercussions for some Republican lawmakers, including South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, who’s black. He called the Obama post, quote, the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House, seen as Alayna Treene has the story joins us now.\n\nSo Alayna, you’re reporting that the president has talked about consequences for Republicans who push back on the post. Is it clear what that means?\n\nALAYNA TREENE: Not necessarily, but we have a good idea, Anderson, from what we’ve even heard the president say this week when we saw six Republicans break with him on a different issue, on his tariffs on Canada.\n\nHe said that they would likely face primaries and would suffer consequences in the elections.\n\nBut look, from what I was told from multiple sources who were with the president or had been hearing about these comments last weekend when he was at Mar-a-Lago is he was specifically focused on two lawmakers.\n\nHe had railed against a lot of them, but Tim Scott in particular really got under his skin that he had spoken out publicly about that post.\n\nThe president telling his allies essentially that he felt Tim Scott should have reached out privately given they have a close relationship. That it was really Scott’s post calling it racist that he felt made the entire story blow up.\n\nI will say from another conversation I had with the source, they said that Tim Scott had actually privately reached out to the president first before he had posted that criticism of the post, but then didn’t reach him. And so he went ahead and published it on social media.\n\nNow, the president also had pretty strong words. I was told even stronger language for Alabama Senator Katie Britt, who had also spoken out about this.\n\nHe had used a lot of expletives, I was told, when talking about her lack of loyalty in doing that.\n\nAnd also said that she was dead to him.\n\nSo very, very much anger from the president over how some of these lawmakers had reacted.\n\nAnd I do think it reflects kind of this growing, a sense that we’re seeing of Republicans who, for the president’s first year in office, really rarely, if at all, stepped out of line to break with him. We’re seeing that happen more and \n\nWatch above via Anderson Cooper 360.\n\nThe post ‘Dead To Me!’ Trump In Profane Frothing Rage At Allies Who Slammed Racist Video Say CNN White House Sources first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "The White House correspondent shared an anecdote from last May, when the White House press secretary helped her out during an overseas trip despite the administration's attacks on her back at home",
    "fullText": "Kaitlan Collins talked about an \"important\" moment between her and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt while they were in Saudi Arabia early in Trump's second term\n\nIn a new podcast interview, Collins said Leavitt stepped in after the Saudi Royal Guard \"freaked out\" at her for shouting a question during a public appearance\n\nThough Collins gave Leavitt \"credit\" for backing her up at the time, the White House correspondent has recently found herself at the receiving end of attacks from the Trump administration\n\nKaitlan Collins opened up about a positive moment with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt early on in President Donald Trump's second term.\n\nDuring a new interview on Heather McMahan's Absolutely Not podcast, CNN's chief White House correspondent revealed that Leavitt once came to her defense during a trip to Saudi Arabia.\n\nCollins — who was more recently called “stupid and nasty” by Trump — recalled a moment on the May 2025 trip when she shouted a question to the president as he stood alongside other world leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\n\"They famously do not like the media there,” Collins, 33, told McMahan. “To put it lightly.”\n\nTrump didn't answer Collins' shouted question, and after Saudi leaders left the room, Collins said the Saudi Royal Guard \"freaked out\" at her because she “dared to ask a question, and they’re not used to that because they don’t have a free press.\"\n\n“They came up and they said, ‘OK, well you can’t come into the next event,’ which was like two minutes later,” Collins recalled. “And I was like, ‘That’s not how this works. I go into the U.S. press,’ and they were like, ‘Well, you’re not coming in.’ ”\n\nCollins went on to explain that White House staff weren’t sure how to go about the situation, so they turned to Leavitt, 28.\n\n“To her credit, she said, ‘No, Kaitlan’s coming in with the rest of the U.S. press,’ and we went in,\" Collins said, referring to Leavitt. “And so it didn’t become this huge issue.”\n\nCollins went on to say Leavitt’s reaction was “important,” noting, “Especially when you’re kind of the U.S. contingent abroad, and we don’t do things like they do in Saudi Arabia.”\n\nThough Leavitt backed Collins up when she was almost shut out by Saudi security on the international trip, the CNN reporter has faced tension with the Trump White House back at home amid the administration's attempts to erode trust in the media.\n\nTrump and Leavitt have a history of lashing out at reporters when they pose questions that the White House finds unfavorable, and Collins has been at the receiving end of hostility multiple times.\n\nAt a CNN town hall in 2023 during the GOP presidential primaries, Trump called Collins a \"nasty person\" for asking about the federal investigation into his handling of classified documents. (Weeks after the town hall, the DOJ indicted him on seven criminal counts, including violating the Espionage Act, though the case was thrown out by a Trump-appointed judge before he was tried.)\n\nIn a lengthy rant shared on Truth Social in December, Trump described Collins as “stupid and nasty” for inquiring about his controversial White House ballroom renovation — though Collins replied to his attack by saying that her question was \"technically\" about his threats toward Venezuela.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOn Feb. 3, Trump lashed out at Collins in person after show the White House press corps a new red-and-white baseball cap that read, “America is back.”\n\n\"Look, CNN is thrilled,” Trump said, before adding, \"She never smiles. Someday I'll see her smile,\" referring to Collins.\n\nShortly after, Collins could be heard asking the president a question while he was talking to a different reporter. “What did you say? Go ahead, CNN,\" Trump said.\n\n“What would you say to the survivors…” Collins, asked, referring to the survivors of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n“You are the worst reporter. No wonder CNN... CNN has no ratings because of people like you. You know she’s a young woman,” Trump interjected, referring to Collins. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile. I’ve known you for 10 years, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a smile on your face.”\n\n“Well I’m asking you about survivors,” Collins replied.\n\n“You know why you’re not smiling? Because you know you’re not telling the truth,\" Trump added. \"You’re a very dishonest organization and they should be ashamed of you.”",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A former federal prosecutor who quit amid a dispute with the Trump administration is now representing former CNN host Don Lemon, who was one of nine people indicted for their alleged roles in disrupting a service at a Minnesota church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official was a pastor.\n\nA court filing Tuesday shows that Lemon has hired former interim U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of major fraud cases for the Minnesota U.S. Attorney’s Office until he resigned last month.\n\nSeveral prosecutors have now left the office at a time of growing frustration with the administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown and the Justice Department’s response to fatal shootings of two people by federal officers in Minneapolis.\n\nLemon had previously said through another attorney that he planned to plead not guilty to federal civil rights charges over his coverage of the church protest. He has said he was not affiliated with the group that disrupted the church service, and that he was there in his capacity as an independent journalist. The indictment alleges various actions by the group that entered the church, including what Lemon said as he reported on the event for his livestream show.\n\nLemon is scheduled to be arraigned on Feb. 13 in federal court in St. Paul.\n\nThe Trump administration has cited the Minnesota fraud cases, in which most defendants have come from the state’s large Somali community, as justification for its immigration crackdown in the state. Thompson estimated in December that the losses to taxpayers from several fraud cases being prosecuted in Minnesota could total $9 billion.\n\nThompson recently formed his own law firm with Harry Jacobs, another former federal prosecutor who resigned amid the upheaval in the office. Jacobs had been lead prosecutor in the case of Vance Boelter, who has pleaded not guilty in last year's assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the nonfatal shootings of a state senator and his wife.\n\nThe firm's website describes them as “battle tested and seasoned” trial lawyers.\n\nThompson did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment Tuesday.",

    "description": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources tell CNN.",
    "fullText": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nA source familiar with the timeline of events said that the US military used the laser technology to shoot down four mylar balloons this week, contributing to the decision by the FAA to shut down local airspace.\n\nThose accounts come as the Trump administration has claimed that a Mexican cartel drone crossing into US airspace is what triggered the 10-mile restriction centered on El Paso International Airport.\n\nLate Tuesday, the FAA abruptly issued a temporary flight restriction that immediately grounded all flights up to 18,000 feet around the city for 10 days, effectively shutting down El Paso International Airport.\n\nRoughly eight hours later, the restriction was lifted. By the time the FAA had lifted the flight restrictions, airlines had already issued travel waivers and notified customers of potential changes.\n\nMultiple sources from the federal government and US airlines told CNN that military activity near El Paso, including US drones monitoring cartel operations and the Pentagon’s planned use of a high-energy laser designed to counter drones, raised immediate concerns for civilian traffic arriving and departing El Paso International Airport. Fort Bliss and its airfield, Biggs Army Airfield, sit just north of the commercial airport, which serves about 100 flights each day.\n\nFAA and Pentagon officials had been scheduled to meet February 20 to review potential impacts and mitigation measures for a test of the laser system, a technology the Pentagon has been testing in more remote areas of the country, multiple sources said. But the Defense Department sought to use the system sooner around El Paso, prompting the FAA to impose the temporary flight restriction until that coordination could occur. The 10-day restriction would have expired on February 21, one day after DoD and the FAA were set to meet.\n\nThe FAA’s decision to close the airspace was made without telling the White House first, according to people familiar with the matter. The issue became a topic of intense focus inside the West Wing in the early morning hours of Wednesday, as Texas lawmakers pressed for answers on why the airspace was suddenly closed without first alerting them.\n\nAn administration official said Wednesday morning that the shutdown was triggered by Defense Department “action to disable” cartel drones. It’s unclear if the presence of drones might have led to the acceleration of the deployment of the laser system.\n\nCNN reached out to the FAA and White House for comment about the differing explanations. The Pentagon on Wednesday continued to refer to the administration official’s statement about a drone breach having caused the airspace closure.\n\nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy posted to social media crediting the FAA and Defense Department with acting “swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.”\n\n“The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” he wrote on X.\n\nIncursions along the southern border are extremely common and historically do not prompt such airspace closures. In 2024, for example, Air Force Gen. Greg Guillot, the commander of NORTHCOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the number of incursions along the US Mexico border was “over a thousand” each month.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration and other US security agencies have used facilities at the Biggs Army Airfield for years as part of efforts to monitor Mexico-based drug cartel operations, current and former US officials said.\n\nEl Paso, with a population of nearly 700,000, is the sixth-largest city in Texas and one of the 25 largest in the United States. It is a hub of cross-border commerce alongside neighboring Ciudad Juárez in Mexico.\n\nNearly 3.5 million passengers passed through El Paso International Airport in the first 11 months of 2025, according to its website. The airport describes itself as the gateway to West Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico.\n\nThe US military has been testing laser-based air defenses against drones in recent months. Last summer, the Army conducted a live-fire exercise using directed energy weapons alongside more traditional air defense systems at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. And last fall, the Army put out a request to industry for ideas on a counter-drone Enduring-High Energy Laser (E-HEL) weapon system.\n\nIn the initial flight restrictions, the FAA classified the area around El Paso﻿ as “(National) Defense Airspace” and said pilots who violated the restriction could be intercepted, detained and questioned by law enforcement.\n\nIt warned that additional actions could be taken for pilots who don’t adhere to the restrictions, including suspension of flight certifications, criminal charges, and that the US government “may use deadly force” if an aircraft poses an “imminent security threat.”\n\nThe sudden FAA restrictions seemed to catch pilots and air traffic controllers by surprise.\n\nAudio from LiveATC.net caught the moment pilots were made aware of the grounding.\n\n“Just pass it on to everybody else, at 06:30 for the next 10 days, we’re all at a ground stop,” a controller said.\n\nA pilot replied, “OK, ground stop 06:30 for how long?”\n\n“Ten days,” the controller replied.\n\n“So the airport is totally closed?” the pilot said, chuckling.\n\nThe controller replied, “Apparently, we just got informed about 30 minutes to an hour ago.”\n\n“So for 10 days you guys are not open,” the pilot said, in disbelief.\n\n“Well, we’ll be here, but no air traffic,” the controller said.\n\n“OK,” the pilot said while laughing.\n\nSamuel, a traveler in El Paso, told CNN affiliate KFOX he was doing a book tour with a client and didn’t get any notification from his airline.\n\n“I just kind of saw all the cops here and the news cameras,” he said. “I gotta figure out what’s going on if there’s another airport that’s not in El Paso, and try to figure out and rent a car out.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas told reporters Wednesday that the closure of the El Paso International Airport was solely a FAA decision and that local officials — including members of Congress — were left completely in the dark before it happened.\n\nShe stressed that she was not notified in advance despite representing the congressional district that’s home to the airport, Fort Bliss and the broader El Paso community.\n\n“They did not alert the El Paso city manager or the El Paso mayor,” Escobar said on a press call Wednesday morning. “Everyone locally on the ground was in the dark, and the impact, obviously, is highly consequential.”\n\nThe Associated Press and CNN’s Evan Perez, Kevin Liptak, Kit Mayer, Camila DeChalus, Karina Tsui, and Diego Mendoza contributed to this report.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.",

    "description": "James Gagliano told CNN's Pamela Brown that he's not convinced the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie is attributable to a traditional kidnapping.",
    "fullText": "Former FBI supervisory special agent James Gagliano told CNN’s Pamela Brown that he’s not convinced the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie is attributable to a traditional kidnapping during a Monday morning interview.\n\nGuthrie, the 84-year-old mother of Today Show host Savannah Guthrie, was reported missing on February 1, and authorities have cited evidence found at the elder Guthrie’s home as reason why they’re treating the case as a likely kidnapping case.\n\nDuring their conversation on Monday, Gagliano explained to Brown why he’s not sure about the theory:\n\nBROWN: The first plea from the Guthrie family, it stressed the urgency of releasing her, their 84-year-old mother. As we know, has serious health issues, desperately needs her medications. We’re now in day nine of her presumably not having those meds. There was no mention of that in this new video. What did you make of that?\n\nGAGLIANO: Yeah, well, you mentioned it. So we have an octogenarian, a woman who’s 84 years old. She obviously has heart conditions, needs medications. And Pam, I’ll give you a stat here. Do you know the percentage of kidnappings that occur of 80-year-olds? It’s like infinitesimal. It’s less than one half of 1%. That’s why this case, again, is so baffling and confounding.\n\nBROWN: And are you convinced it’s a kidnapping?\n\nGAGLIANO: Am I convinced that this was an actual kidnapping?\n\nBROWN: Like an abduction, like they took her-\n\nGAGLIANO: No, and I’ll give you this-, yeah, and I’ll tell you this: there are numbers of ways to conduct kidnappings, right? There’s a new craze of this, and again, we saw this south of the border when I was stationed there called virtual kidnappings where they do everything they can to make you believe that they have your loved one in their quote, unquote “possession” when they don’t. And they’re acting quickly, they’re utilizing AI now, artificial intelligence, to help, you know, cause this fog of vagaries so that the families are panicked and do what they need to do. It’s just, there’s so many questions here and the fact that the kidnappers, if this was a kidnapping, had a 14-hour head start from the time she was dropped off at home, supposedly at 10 o’clock, until the family notified law enforcement sometime around noon the next day, and you see the flurry of law enforcement efforts back and forth. I don’t think there’s anything to be taken from that. People are reading too much into that. That’s the normal progression in an investigation where one lead might trick off another lead, and you move from one thing to the other. And lastly, two things are gonna solve this case: one is good detective work that’s flat footwork, knocking on doors, talking to people, canvassing, interviewing people. And the second piece of this, and the biggest one, is the digital imagery, the digital exhaust that investigators are going through right now from the kidnappers’, quote unquote, “kidnappers'” ransom note. From the door ring bell that was removed, but they might still be able to harvest some forensic evidence there. Things like that are probably gonna solve this case, and we all hope and pray it’s gonna have a good conclusion.\n\nThe post Ex-FBI Special Agent Tells CNN Why He Thinks Nancy Guthrie Disappearance May Not Be ‘Kidnapping’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence obtained voting machines from Puerto Rico and probed them for security vulnerabilities, the office said in a statement to CNN Wednesday.\n\nThe extraordinary move comes amid Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard’s broader search for voter fraud at the behest of President Donald Trump, who has falsely claimed that the 2020 election was rigged despite numerous court rulings and audits debunking the claim. Gabbard was present as FBI agents executed a search warrant in Fulton County, Georgia, last week related to the 2020 election.\n\nThe ODNI claimed in its statement to have found “extremely concerning” cybersecurity and operational deployment practices with the voting machines in Puerto Rico but did not provide evidence.\n\nThe US attorney in Puerto Rico, Homeland Security Investigations agents and an FBI supervisory special agent “facilitated the voluntary turnover of electronic voting hardware and software to ODNI for analysis,” an ODNI spokesperson said. It’s unclear exactly when the agency received and studied the voting machines.\n\nIn justifying the voting equipment probe, the ODNI cited “publicly reported claims relating to elections in Puerto Rico alleging discrepancies and systemic anomalies in their electronic voting systems.”\n\nDavid Becker, the executive director of a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works with election officials, told CNN that voting machines are subject to regular testing and a strict chain of custody. The machines count paper ballots that are audited and recounted to confirm the machine counts. Those are all security controls that have proven effective, he said.\n\nThe director of national intelligence coordinates intelligence from across the 17 other organizations in the US intelligence community. It is unprecedented for the ODNI to play such a hands-on role in election infrastructure, former intelligence officials and election experts told CNN.\n\n“This is well beyond what ODNI has the authority or expertise to do,” a former senior US intelligence official who has worked on election security told CNN Wednesday in reaction to the ODNI statement. “This is amateur hour.”\n\nThe ODNI activity in Puerto Rico “appears intended to intimidate and denigrate election officials, along with the constant threats of prosecutions, and the repeated lies about our election system,” Becker told CNN.\n\nIt was not clear if and when ODNI would release more public information on its probe of voting equipment in Puerto Rico. The agency “is currently coordinating with our partners across the U.S. government to provide the findings from our inquiry to agencies that can take actions to improve the security of our system,” the ODNI spokesperson said.\n\nCNN has requested comment from election officials in Puerto Rico.",

While recent research has shown promise in entirely convolutional, or CNN, architectures, they have not been explored using the pre-train-fine-tune paradigm. In the context of language models, are convolutional models competitive to Transformers when pre-trained? This paper investigates this research question and presents several interesting findings. Across an extensive set of experiments on 8 datasets/tasks, we find that CNN-based pre-trained models are competitive and outperform their Transformer counterpart in certain scenarios, albeit with caveats.",

    "fullText": "CNN correspondent Veronica Miracle began coughing and choking live on camera when Trump ICE agents fired pepper balls into a crowd of protesters at an ICE facility in Los Angeles.\n\nOn Friday night’s edition of CNN’s OutFront, anchor Erin Burnett tossed to Miracle as she reported from LA amid protests across the country against Trump’s deportation forces.\n\nWhen ICE fired on the crowd, Miracle exclaimed “I just got hit!” and choked on the chemical irritant for a considerable stretch — then kept reporting:\n\nBURNETT: I want to go straight to Veronica Miracle because she is there on the ground in L.A., where the crowd that I know that is around you, Veronica, is on ICE property. What are you seeing?\n\nVERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, it’s really intense here. And, Erin, I just — we just all got pepper sprayed. And so I’m just still recovering from that. There’s so much of the pepper spray still in the air and so, so many people around us coughing and gagging, including us.\n\nSo, it’s been a really interesting scene here. I’ve never seen this before in all of my years covering protests here in this area, here in downtown L.A., where they were actually, these protesters were able to get onto the property. There was a skirmish line of police officers of Department of Homeland Security officers. They were in a bit of a line, and the protesters overtook them and were able to basically push them further and further back all the way to the loading dock, where they essentially cornered all of them and pushed them back inside.\n\nThere was, you know, a bit of a skirmish. There were some pepper spray, people were throwing bottles, but ultimately these protesters have overtaken this property, which I have never seen before. Usually, police are here and they’re able to keep protesters off of the property.\n\nThis is a crowd that is kind of at the tail end of a very long protest. This started at 1:00 p.m. local over in city hall. Okay, I just got hit! Hold on, hold on. I just got — sorry.\n\nBURNETT: All right, take your time there, Veronica.\n\nMIRACLE: Sorry. I can’t breathe. I’m sorry.\n\nBURNETT: Take your time. Take your time. Right. Let’s just make sure Veronica’s okay.\n\nMIRACLE: Yeah. Sorry about that. Yeah.\n\nUNIDNETIFIED MALE; Let’s go back.\n\nMIRACLE: All right. So obviously, they’re — they’re shooting. They’re shooting something. Pepper balls or something. So, it looks like you can see an officer back there. He’s alone, and they’re just throwing things at him.\n\nI mean, it’s just pretty incredible that these protesters have overtaken this. And there’s really. There’s no police.\n\nI don’t see anybody here to kind of manage this crowd. So like I was saying, this is at the tail end of a very long day. It looks like they’re — they’re cheering because they were able to push that officer back inside. Okay.\n\nWatch above via CNN’s OutFront.\n\nThe post ‘I Just Got Hit!’ CNN Reporter Chokes Live On Camera As Trump ICE Agents Fire Irritants At Protesters first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Don Lemon, the former CNN anchor, was arrested in Los Angeles on Thursday night.\n\nLemon's arrest comes after protesters interrupted a service at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nHe has said that he was reporting as a journalist when he entered the Cities Church on January 18. Protesters said that one of the church's pastors also worked for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIn a statement, Lemon's attorney Abbe Lowell said he was taken into custody by federal agents in Los Angeles, where he was covering the Grammy awards.\n\n\"Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,\" Lowell said.\n\nLowell called the criminal charges an \"unprecedented attack on the First Amendment.\"\n\n\"Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,\" he said.\n\nAttorney General Pamela Bondi confirmed Lemon's arrest in a post on X.\n\nShe also said that Georgia Fort, another independent journalist, had been taken into custody, along with two other people.\n\n\"At my direction, early this morning federal agents arrested Don Lemon, Trahern Jeen Crews, Georgia Fort, and Jamael Lydell Lundy, in connection with the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota,\" Bondi wrote.\n\nFort posted a livestream on Facebook on Friday morning where she said federal agents were at her door.\n\n\"They said they were able to go to a grand jury sometime, I guess, in the last 24 hours, and they have a warrant for my arrest,\" Fort said in the video. \"I've talked to my attorney and I've been advised to go with them.\"\n\n\"It's hard to understand how we gave constitutional rights when you can be arrested for just being a member of the press,\" she said at the end of the video. \"Alright, I gotta go, they're knocking.\"\n\nThe Trump administration sought to charge eight people in relation to the Cities Church incident, citing a law protecting people in a service at a house of worship. Minnesota has been rocked by major protests amid a surge of ICE agents that the Trump administration has sent to the state to ramp up deportations.\n\nA federal magistrate judge had previously rejected charges against five people who appeared at the protest, including Lemon, according to The New York Times.\n\nLemon left CNN in 2023 after 17 years at the network. He has since worked as an independent content creator, distributing his work on social media and hosting live events.\n\nThe day after the Cities Church protest, President Donald Trump shared a screenshot of an X post on his Truth Social calling for Lemon to be imprisoned.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Seth Stern, an executive at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said the arrests of Lemon and Fort were \"naked attacks on freedom of the press.\"\n\n\"These arrests, under bogus legal theories for obviously constitutionally protected reporting, are clear warning shots aimed at other journalists,\" Seth said. \"The unmistakable message is that journalists must tread cautiously because the government is looking for any way to target them.\"",

    "fullText": "The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group is now in the Indian Ocean, putting it closer to assist in any potential US operations targeting Iran, two sources told CNN.\n\nThe group is within the area of responsibility of US Central Command, whose purview includes military operations in the Middle East.\n\nStill, the carrier is not necessarily in a final position for any potential operation. President Donald Trump continues to consider options for striking Iran, but there is no indication any decision has been made.\n\nA carrier strike group normally includes an aircraft carrier, guided missile cruisers, anti-aircraft warships and anti-submarine destroyers or frigates.\n\nCNN has previously reported the carrier was en route to the region.\n\nAllies have been urging the US to forestall any military action.\n\nIn Iran, the death toll from the government’s crackdown on protesters continues to climb. On Sunday, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported that 5,520 protesters have been killed since demonstrations started late last month. It said that an additional 17,091 deaths were still being reviewed.\n\nTrump has warned Iran against killing protesters, repeatedly threatening to intervene in the country if it does so. Last week, however, he said that Iran “wants to talk,” suggesting that the US may enter discussions with Tehran.\n\nOn Monday, the administration reiterated it is open to having discussions with the Iranian regime as long as “they know what the terms are,” a US official said.\n\n“We are open for business … as they say, so if they want to contact us and they know what the terms are, then we’re going to have the conversation,” the official said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic is bracing for a potential US attack. In Tehran, a large mural was unveiled in Revolution Square on Sunday depicting a swarm of jet fighters flying over a warship bearing the US flag.\n\nDuring Friday prayers in the capital, the imam leading the sermon warned the US against launching any attacks.\n\n“The trillion dollars you invested in the region are under the watch of our missiles,” Mohammad Ali Akbari said.\n\nIran has been escalating its rhetoric against the US over the past week, warning that any attack would be met with force capable of destabilizing the entire Middle East.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei told journalists Monday that Tehran is “more than capable” of responding to any aggression from the US with a “regretful” response.\n\n“The arrival of one or several warships does not impact Iran’s defensive determination,” he said. “Our armed forces are monitoring every development and are not wasting a single second to enhance their capabilities.”\n\nOn Saturday, the Iranian military said its missile capabilities and efficiency have increased significantly since the 12-day war with Israel in June. Iran launched multiple waves of missile and drone attacks at Israeli targets during that conflict, which started after Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran last year, killing several top military commanders and nuclear scientists. The United States later joined, targeting key Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\nIran possesses a large arsenal of medium- and long-range ballistic missiles, several types of which were fired at Israel during the conflict. Its drones, a pillar of its military power, have also been deployed beyond its borders, including in Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nMaj. Gen. Ali Abdollahi, the commander of Iran’s Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters, a key military operational command, said last week that any aggression against his country “will immediately turn all American interests, bases and centers of influence into legitimate, definite and accessible targets” for Iran.\n\nIranian officials have also warned that a US attack would lead to strikes on Washington’s allies in the region. US-allied Arab nations in the Persian Gulf have lobbied Trump against a strike, according to regional officials speaking to CNN this month.\n\nIran also has a network of regional proxies that could potentially be mobilized in the event of a strike. While some of its surrogates, such as Hezbollah, have been significantly weakened by Israel over the past two years, others remain heavily armed.\n\nOn Sunday, Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi, the commander of Kataeb Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq, called on Iran’s loyalists “across the globe … to prepare for all-out war in support of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”\n\n“We tell the enemies, the war against the (Islamic) Republic, will not be a walk in the park,” he said.\n\nCNN’s Nadeen Ebrahim and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "CNN’s Jake Tapper came with receipts when Border Patrol Commander-at-large Gregory Bovino challenged him on social media for insinuating he was a liar.\n\nTapper’s post about Bovino came in the wake of the Border Patrol shooting death of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, when Bovino outraged critics with his version of the events leading up to the shooting. Bovino claimed on CNN Sunday, “The victims are the Border Patrol agents. I’m not blaming the Border Patrol agents. The suspect put himself in that situation.”\n\nTapper suggested that Bovino was a known liar by retweeting a judge’s ruling from November on Bovino’s tactics in Chicago. Tapper wrote, “‘Bovino admitted in his deposition that he lied multiple times,’ wrote the judge.”\n\nBovino, in response, challenged Tapper — writing, “Then identify the lie, Jake. No one can seem to find this mysterious ‘lie’.”\n\n“Happy to help, sir,” Tapper replied, before producing more court documents.\n\n“Bovino admitted in his deposition that he lied multiple times about the events that occurred in Little Village that prompted him to throw tear gas at protesters,” the court record read. “‘Bovino and DHS have represented that a rock hit Bovino in the helmet before he threw tear gas. …On the first day,’ of his deposition ‘Bovino admitted that he was not hit with a rock until after he had deployed tear gas…'”\n\n\"Bovino admitted in his deposition that he lied multiple times about the events that occurred in Little Village that prompted him to throw tear gas at protesters.\"\n\n\"Bovino and DHS have represented that a rock hit Bovino in the helmet… https://t.co/xaaIUXwhq1\n\nTapper added 11 more posts to the thread laying out examples of how Bovino lied repeatedly when recounting his interactions with protesters.\n\nIn the final post, Tapper linked to court documents and wrote, “This is from a November 20, 2025, 233-page opinion from Judge Sara Ellis. Let me know if I can help with anything else.”\n\nIn addition to feuding online with Tapper, Bovino spent Sunday going after the likes of Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), and The Bulwark’s Bill Kristol.\n\nThe post ‘Happy to Help, Sir’: Jake Tapper Brings Receipts After Greg Bovino Dares Him to Call Out His Deposition Lies first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "One week ago, Destiny Jackson spoke with CNN about her family of eight getting tear gassed in Minneapolis while stopped on their way home from her son’s basketball game on January 14.

    "fullText": "One week ago, Destiny Jackson spoke with CNN about her family of eight getting tear gassed in Minneapolis while stopped on their way home from her son’s basketball game on January 14.\n\nThe family says they did not realize an anti-ICE protest was happening around them when they first reached the scene. Video from the scene showed her children rushing out of the car and into a nearby house for safety, on the same night a federal agent shot a man in the leg.\n\nIt was one of several interviews Jackson had done that week with different news outlets. Someone asked her to make a GoFundMe, so she did, she said — and donations poured in, raising more than $170,000 in all.\n\nSince then, Jackson tells CNN she has faced online attacks by far-right social media users and select media publications.\n\nThat’s partly because, since CNN published the story, a one-hour-and-36-minute livestream from that evening has surfaced, which was first reported by Crime Watch Mpls and then covered by the Daily Mail, that shows Jackson at the actual protest itself without her children – at one point, making an inflammatory comment on camera.\n\nBut that’s also because Jackson has a past criminal record.\n\nIn two interviews with CNN on January 23 and 24, Jackson explained more about why she was seen at the protest in the livestream and addressed her previous criminal charges.\n\nIn her January 17 interview with CNN, Jackson said she had retrieved her mother from the protest before getting back into her vehicle with her six kids and husband to leave the area.\n\nThat’s when she says she heard commotion from the protest and told her husband to drive away, but said they were blocked in and couldn’t get out. From there, a tear gas canister rolled under her car and exploded.\n\nIn the newly surfaced video, she and her husband appear in and out of frame at or near the protest for at least 45 minutes.\n\nJackson explained she and her husband were driving home from her son’s basketball game when they noticed the road ahead was blocked off. Cars were coming from every direction, while some cars were parked on the street, so they pulled over to allow cars to pass, she said.\n\nHer husband wanted to know what was happening, so he got out of the car to ask around. From the passenger seat, Jackson says she coincidentally noticed her mother, her mother’s boyfriend and a family friend crossing the street. She called out to them and they came to talk to her, explaining they were headed to a protest.\n\nShortly after, her family friend came back to the car because it was too cold. At that point, Jackson said she didn’t want her mom to be at the protest because she was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure, so she walked to the protest to try to get her mother to leave. Her family friend, whom she refers to as “auntie,” stayed in the car to watch Jackson’s children.\n\nJackson said she was trying to get her mom to leave the entire time she was at the demonstration, but added she also talked to people while she was there. Her husband is just “nosy,” and wanted to see what was happening, she said.\n\nIn recent interviews with CNN, she explained she had been able to leave before the situation turned heated, but she had not wanted to because she was focused on her mother. It was when the situation escalated that her family’s vehicle became trapped and they couldn’t get out of the area, Jackson said.\n\nAlthough CNN cannot independently confirm that Jackson’s vehicle was trapped when the protest escalated, Minnesota Attorney General Ellison previously told CNN the family was “caught in the middle of” the situation.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin also said in an email to CNN on January 16: “This family was the victim of rioters and agitators whose lawless behavior is encouraged by Minnesota’s top leaders.”\n\nAbout 10 minutes before the livestream captured what appears to be flash bangs going off, Jackson is seen in the video talking to a friend in a car, away from the demonstration.\n\nThe livestreamer comes up to the two of them, and in response to a prompt from the livestreamer, Jackson says: “We’re going to kill these motherf**kers.”\n\nThe livestreamer responds: “No you not, no she not.”\n\nIt’s unclear, from the video alone, what Jackson meant.\n\n“Shooting and killing people is unacceptable, that was completely taken out of context,” Jackson said to CNN.\n\nShe explained the livestreamer had been talking about guns and weapons, so she claims she was sarcastically asking him if he was going to kill federal agents.\n\n“I was like sarcastically asking him that … I wasn’t saying we’re going to like, that we were gonna kill ICE, no,” she said.\n\nAbout three minutes after Jackson’s comment in the livestream, her husband is seen standing in a crowd of protesters who were chanting, “Pigs, go home.” He is not seen chanting with the protesters in the livestream.\n\nA few minutes later, what appear to be flash-bang devices start to go off and the crowd disperses.\n\nJackson is seen in the passenger seat of her car a few minutes later, recording on her phone. A few seconds later, it appears that a tear gas canister goes off near her vehicle.\n\nJackson tells CNN that they couldn’t move their car once the demonstration near them escalated.\n\nA tear gas canister rolled under the family’s car and exploded underneath it, she said. Bystanders helped her get her children out of the car, with her 6-month-old being the last to make it out.\n\nShe said she gave the baby mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while people poured milk on her other children’s eyes because of the tear gas.\n\nJackson said she went to the hospital with her baby and two of her children, who have severe asthma.\n\nThe city of Minneapolis said in a statement the tear gas caused “a 6-month-old infant inside the vehicle to experience breathing difficulties,” according to initial reports.\n\nWhen police and the fire department were able to reach the family, “the infant was breathing and stable, but (in) serious condition,” according to the statement.\n\nAs of Saturday, Jackson and her baby are still dealing with congestion from the tear gas, she said, with her baby taking medication to clear his airways.\n\nCritics are upset that Jackson is collecting money on a GoFundMe after getting tear gassed given her criminal record, she tells CNN.\n\nCourt records show Jackson agreed to plead guilty to “aiding an offender – accomplice after the fact” in June 2021. In the same case, she was also charged with murder, but the charges were later dismissed, according to a court document.\n\nJames Moore, who Jackson says was her boyfriend at the time, was sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to intentional second-degree murder in 2020, according to a Hennepin County Attorney’s Office statement.\n\nMoore fatally shot a man who was lured to an apartment to sell marijuana in an apparent robbery gone wrong, the statement says. Moore and another man ran into Jackson’s apartment after the shooting.\n\nA witness said it was Jackson who lured the man by creating a fake Facebook message, according to the statement and a criminal complaint. From there, Moore and another man “had devised a plan to rob (the victim) when he arrived,” the prosecutor’s statement says.\n\nHowever, Jackson was only convicted of “aiding an offender – accomplice after the fact.”\n\n“I had nothing to do with anybody being killed,” Jackson tells CNN, explaining that the accomplice after-the-fact charge was based on the fact that the men fled to her apartment after the killing. Jackson also claims she was not the person to write the Facebook message, explaining she gave her boyfriend access to her account.\n\n“Now that (I’m) an adult and all that stuff, like we don’t share our passwords and stuff with people,” she said.\n\nShe was sentenced to 28 days in jail, which she had already served at the time, and five years of probation, according to court records. She tells CNN she has a few months left of her probation.\n\nShe believes if she had never made a GoFundMe, she doesn’t think so much “negativity” about her story would have surfaced.\n\n“What happened to us was traumatic, you know, in our mind, we feel so guilty … yes, I probably should have left sooner than we did,” she said. “It’s very traumatizing, like the things that we went through and the things that people are saying.”",

    "description": "CNN commentator Maggie Haberman said that the Greenland arrangement being discussed by President Donald Trump and European leaders seems to be one that already exists.",
    "fullText": "CNN commentator Maggie Haberman said that the Greenland arrangement being discussed by President Donald Trump and European leaders seems to be one that already exists.\n\nTrump spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday after he spent weeks demanding that Denmark hand over Greenland. The president cited “national security” reasons even though a 1951 treaty allows the U.S. to expand its military presence on the island, where it already maintains a base.\n\nIn his address, Trump said he wants “right, title, and ownership” of the territory. Afterward, the president announced he and European leaders had arrived at a “framework” and a “concept of a deal” regarding Greenland. He gave no specifics, but conservative commentators hailed the mystery agreement as the stuff of a modern-day Metternich.\n\nOn Wednesday’s AC360, Haberman said signs indicate that the deal in question is “something that is already in existence.”\n\n“So, Maggie, is it clear to you what, if anything, President Trump is getting from Denmark in Greenland that the U.S. doesn’t already have de facto control over?” Anderson Cooper asked.\n\n“No. And look, Anderson, we don’t know the answers to these questions,” Haberman replied. “There’s a lot left unsaid. The president didn’t answer this.”\n\nHaberman went on to say that based on what little information has been provided about the “framework,” it appears to be a reflection of the preexisting arrangement among the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland.\n\n“As of now, based on what they’re talking about, it looks as if they’re talking about something that is already in existence,” she continued. “And in fact, the U.S. used to have a greater military presence in Greenland. It got scaled back after the Cold War.”\n\nShe noted that in his Davos speech, Trump maligned NATO and questioned if it would ever come to the defense of the U.S. In fact, the only time NATO’s collective defense provision was invoked was on behalf of the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n“Article 5 [of the NATO treaty] was invoked once, and it was after 9/11,” Haberman said. “And someone who is from New York, it’s surprising that they don’t recall that. And so, he is speaking about this completely in transactional terms. And you can see that this is not over. I understand that [NATO Secretary-General] Mark Rutte is trying to calm things down, but European leaders are still very alarmed. And leaders in Denmark have been very alarmed for weeks and weeks now before this really became much more public.”\n\nThe post Maggie Haberman Says Trump’s Greenland ‘Deal’ Appears To Be ‘Something That Is Already in Existence’ first appeared on Mediaite.",
