    "fullText": "The Hollywood bidding war between Paramount Skydance and Netflix has created a meme frenzy.\n\nThe two media giants are in an all-out battle for Warner Bros. Discovery after it accepted Netflix's offer to acquire its studio and streaming businesses for an equity value of $72 billion. David Ellison's Paramount launched a hostile $30-per-share bid for all of WBD on Monday.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery owns the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, the HBO Max streaming service, and TV networks such as CNN, TNT, and TruTV. It confirmed receipt of Paramount's unsolicited offer on Monday.\n\nBoth entities have made their cases on why they'd be the best owner for WBD. Although internet comedians don't have a say in where the deals land, it hasn't stopped them from weighing in with viral jokes about the dueling companies and their quest to acquire WBD.\n\nSome social media users are poking fun at the back-and-forth with memes about how far each company is willing to go to gain WBD's favor. One post compared the battle for the best offer to a scene from the HBO business drama \"Succession,\" a title Netflix would own if the deal goes through.\n\nA post shared by Karl Smith, CFA (L1 Candidate) (@wallstreetintern)\n\nThe Instagram meme account Litquidity used parody images that appeared to be AI-created of two business leaders speaking at the DealBook Summit to mock how each company is trying to prove its offer is better.\n\nNetflix and Paramount trying to show off why their Warner Bros acquisition offers are better pic.twitter.com/mjpP7sjAnA\n\nSome people seem to be using humor to cope with the idea of more consolidation in Hollywood. They are pushing back on both offers with memes about stopping the looming acquisition completely.\n\nChristopher Nolan, James Cameron, and Steven Spielberg on their way to stop Netflix from buying Warner Bros: pic.twitter.com/pnCAU4kclM\n\n\"I'm putting together a team to fight the Netflix Warner Bros merger,\" one X user captioned a compilation video of various actors and famous filmmakers.\n\nI’m putting together a team to fight the Netflix Warner Bros merger: pic.twitter.com/wl26YfGCjg\n\nOthers speculated on what the movie-watching experience could be like under Warner Bros. Discovery's new ownership. One TikTok video showed a man sitting down to watch a movie, only for the intros to include a confusing mix of studios, backers such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and even a DJ, being played before the movie began.\n\nevery company is every company #business#news #netflix\n\nIn the midst of all the jokes, Netflix argues that its offer would be better for consumers and creators, while Ellison says Paramount is more likely to win regulatory approval and offers Hollywood more certainty.\n\nWhat all of this means in the long run is unclear so far. It could lead to job cuts in the entertainment industry as the giants consolidate their power. The trends of streaming services getting pricier and fewer movies hitting theaters could also continue, as companies release less content, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nEither way — as with many serious big business deals — consumers and industry insiders are finding ways to laugh through it.",

    "description": "Paramount's David Ellison wants to buy all of Warner, including its cable networks. How much they're worth is a big part of his fight vs. Netflix.",
    "fullText": "The fight between Paramount and Netflix over Warner Bros. Discovery is ultimately about who gets to control HBO and the Warner movie studio.\n\nBut the way that fight gets settled is going to involve an unusual side quest: CNN, TNT, the Food Network, and a bunch of other cable networks WBD wants to get rid of. Specifically: What are all of those shrinking cable networks worth?\n\nWhich leads us to a pretty weird place: Paramount CEO David Ellison, who wants to buy all of WBD — including its cable networks — is arguing that those cable networks aren't worth very much at all. And Netflix, which doesn't want to buy those cable networks, is implicitly arguing that they're worth much more.\n\nThat's because in the Netflix scenario, current WBD shareholders would go through two transactions: First, WBD would spin out its cable networks into a new company, and WBD investors would be given shares in that new company. Then Netflix would buy the remainder of WBD — HBO and the studio — for cash and stock.\n\nWhich means Netflix, and WBD executives who have blessed the Netflix offer, will want investors to think the cable networks are valuable. Ellison wants them to think the opposite.\n\n\"The lower you value the cable assets, the greater advantage Paramount's bid has. If shareholders believe the cable operations are more highly valued, then Netflix's bid, which assumes they will be spun off, means investors get an overall bigger sum of money.\"\n\nAnd here's the actual gap: Ellison says the spin-off is worth about $1 per WBD share — or roughly $2.5 billion, based on WBD's current valuation. Independent analysts think it might be closer to $4 per share — or roughly $10 billion. Paramount and Netflix reps declined to comment; WBD hasn't responded to my request.\n\nSo one side is describing a rounding error, especially when it's part of a deal that could be worth $108 billion. The other is describing, more or less, a midsize media company.\n\nAnd yes, this is equity value, not enterprise value — this already assumes the spin-off gets saddled with billions of WBD's debt under the Netflix plan. But we're going to focus this conversation on the shares that ultimately end up in a WBD investor's brokerage account.\n\nAnd if you believe David Ellison and Co., those investors aren't getting much. Because CNN, Turner, and all of the networks formerly owned by Discovery aren't worth much at all.\n\nAnd yes, the cable network industry is a falling knife, which is why many big media companies that own cable networks are trying to ditch them. But are things really that bad?\n\nMaybe. Maybe, using Ellison's math, all of CNN plus a pile of other cable networks — which still generate cash, mind you — are worth about 16 Bari Weisses, based on the reported $150 million he paid for her Free Press site.\n\nOr maybe all of that is worth $10 billion — which means it's still less than 1% of Google. Which feels like a metaphor for the entire media industry in 2025: Even a roomful of famous brands barely registers in a world run by giant software companies.\n\nSomewhere in that $2.5 billion to $10 billion range is the real answer. But the headline is clear: The networks that once held the entire cable bundle together are now garage sale leftovers. Worth something to someone — but a whole lot less than they used to be.",

    "description": "Former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer predicts \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros. between Netflix and Paramount.",
    "fullText": "A former Disney executive who oversaw its dealmaking expects \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer\" from Netflix, Paramount Skydance, or both, said Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, on Tuesday at the UBS media conference.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion, including debt. Paramount Skydance then launched a hostile offer, saying on Monday that it's willing to pay $108.4 billion for the whole firm, including the TV networks like CNN and HGTV. Executives at Netflix and Paramount CEO David Ellison have each framed their offers as the best for employees, Hollywood, WBD shareholders, and TV viewers. Both suitors also said they're confident they can pass regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMayer, now the co-CEO of Cocomelon owner Candle Media, said he thinks Paramount's hostile bid will reignite the faceoff for Warner Bros. and force the eventual winner to fork over more money.\n\n\"From the Warner Bros. Discovery perspective, this is nothing but good news,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer added: \"Does it move up another $5 billion or $10 billion? I think it probably does. That's what it's going to take to win it.\"\n\nMayer said the battle for Warner Bros. reminds him of the fight for control of 21st Century Fox between Disney and Comcast, which he was involved in during his tenure at the Mouse House.\n\nUnder Mayer, Disney agreed to buy Fox's studio, FX, and its stake in Hulu for $52.4 billion in equity, or $66.1 billion with debt, in December 2017. Six months later, cable giant Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash offer for those same assets. Disney ultimately won, but it was forced to pay a heftier price of $71.3 billion. Mayer helped engineer Disney's initial agreement with Fox, but had moved to a role atop Disney's streaming business by the time the acquisition closed.\n\n\"That was a difficult process,\" Mayer said of Comcast's bid for Fox. \"It added $19 billion to the price tag. Still a good deal, but not the exceptional deal that it was before we had to pay more.\"\n\nWhile Disney's deal with Fox gave it control over Hulu and bolstered its library, Disney activist investor Nelson Peltz argued that the Mouse House had shown \"poor judgment\" by \"overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets.\"\n\nAs Netflix and Paramount vie for Warner Bros., Mayer said the Disney-Comcast showdown \"points to where we might see this going.\"\n\nThat's because Ellison's $30-per-share hostile bid, which Paramount also sent to WBD's board, might not be rich enough, Mayer said.\n\n\"David Ellison has already kind of hinted at that, that he hasn't done his best and final yet, and I suspect he hasn't,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer was likely referencing a text message from Ellison to WBD CEO David Zaslav, which was made public as part of a Paramount filing on Monday: \"Please note importantly we did not include 'best and final' in our bid.\"\n\n\"The team at Paramount is aggressive,\" Mayer said. He pointed to the gargantuan amount of money that David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry, have at their disposal.\n\n\"I don't think there's a whole lot of hesitancy to spend it,\" Mayer said.",

    "description": "The fight between Netflix and Paramount over who will buy Warner Bros. is heating up. Here's what markets are thinking about the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "A bidding war has broken out over one of America's most iconic media companies, and investors in the three firms involved are mixed on the prospect of where it'll all shake out.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery have climbed on the back of a hostile bid from Paramount Skydance to acquire the film and television company, but they're still slightly below the competing bid from Netflix, which was announced as the winner of the sale process last Friday.\n\nParamount on Monday made an all-cash offer worth $30 a share to acquire Warner Bros. and its film studio and streaming services.\n\nIt's unclear which way Warner Bros. will go. The company's board of directors said on Monday that it wasn't changing its recommendation regarding its agreement with Netflix, but would review Paramount's offer over the next two weeks. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nMarkets, though, are flashing some clues about what investors think might happen next. Here's what to watch.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery rose to $27.70 on Tuesday, just below Netflix's offer of $27.75 a share.\n\nIf the stock were to surpass that level, that could be a sign investors expect Warner Bros. to go with Paramount's offer, or that they expect Netflix to put together a better offer, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I would say that there's a combination of both of those things probably in play right now,\" Hogan said of investors pricing in both scenarios, though he noted that trading activity in Warner Bros. Discovery shares may also be reflecting uncertainty among investors as Paramount revealed its hostile bid on Monday.\n\nThere's also the issue of regulatory approval, which could explain the slight discount in Warner Bros. Discovery stock to Netflix's offer price. Comments from Donald Trump on Monday suggested Netflix's ownership of Warner Bros. could draw scrutiny from the administration.\n\nIn a statement after it unveiled its offer, Paramount said its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery would offer shareholders around $18 billion \n\nNetflix stock is down 7% since last Thursday's close, with shares dropping through Friday's session as investors digested the news that the media giant would acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio business.\n\nInvestors rarely reward the acquirer in a large M&A deal like this, and it appears they're also not thrilled about the prospect of a fierce bidding war.\n\nNetflix stock continued to slide through Monday's session on news of Paramount's competing bid, and dipped again on Tuesday. The streaming platform has agreed to pay Warner Bros. $5.8 billion if its deal doesn't go through.\n\nShares of Paramount Skydance, meanwhile, jumped on Monday on enthusiasm for a potential deal, but the stock slipped 3% on Tuesday.\n\nBettors don't see Paramount's hostile bid going through with ease. While Paramount has edged up slightly over Netflix on some open bets on Polymarket, other wagers have its chances of acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery by mid-2026 at less than 50%.\n\nOn Polymarket, bettors see a 43% chance Paramount will be the winning bid, compared to a 39% chance priced in for Netflix.\n\nOn Kalshi, the odds that Paramount will win are about 50-50.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance and Netflix bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, highlighting streaming, Hollywood jobs, and regulatory approval in their rival pitches.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood's latest high-drama battle of the titans: Paramount versus Netflix.\n\nDavid Ellison's Paramount made a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery after WBD rebuffed its multiple offers and accepted Netflix's offer to buy its studio and streaming business.\n\nThis means Ellison, who is backed by his billionaire father, Larry Ellison of Oracle, is making his case directly to shareholders on why he'd be the best owner for WBD.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"\n\nNetflix didn't respond to the hostile bid but has said that by combining its streaming hits with WBD's classic library and prestige HBO fare, it can supercharge its offering.\n\n\"Together, we can give audiences around the world even more value and choice, and get one step closer to being the most loved and the most valued entertainment company,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in announcing the deal Friday.\n\nHere's how the companies made their cases to various stakeholders, which include investors, employees, Hollywood talent, and regulators.\n\nFinancials: Paramount offered $30 per WBD share for all of WBD, compared to Netflix's offer of $27.75 per WBD share for its streaming and studios business, excluding its TV networks, such as CNN and TNT. While Netflix's offer was a mix of cash and stock, Ellison emphasized that Paramount's offer is all cash, and $17.6 billion more than the Netflix deal, an $82.7 billion offer that includes $72 billion in equity.\n\nApproval: Ellison repeatedly argued that he's more likely to win regulatory approval than Netflix is. He said he anticipated approval coming in as little as 12 months. President Donald Trump said he'll be \"involved\" in evaluating the deal. Larry Ellison is a longtime ally of Trump, and the firm of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is part of the Paramount offer.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Ellison argued that the Paramount deal would be good for jobs and consumers. He said Paramount is committed to growing the film and TV output of both businesses, including a theatrical slate of 30-plus releases a year. It's a pointed contrast with Netflix, whose preference for getting movies onto its streaming service quickly has created friction with the film industry. (Netflix has said it would continue to release Warner Bros. movies in theaters.) Ellison said adding WBD would make Paramount a robust competitor to Netflix, while Netflix buying WBD would extend its dominance in streaming and give it more power to raise prices to consumers.\n\nFinancials: Netflix said the deal would give it a number of financial benefits. While Netflix is the top subscription streaming service, it has a ways to go in creating culture-defining IP. A big part of Netflix's pitch is that it'll be able to build on WBD's famous franchises like DC Comics and Harry Potter, fueling a flywheel that'll expand its business. WBD would have to pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it accepts a different offer, which Netflix said limited its risk. On the other hand, Netflix would have to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee if the deal were blocked by regulators.\n\nApproval: Wall Street analysts have generally characterized Netflix as having a tougher approval path. However, the company has been making the pitch to Trump and his administration. Trump said Sunday that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos visited him last week. Trump said Sarandos was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" However, Trump added that Netflix has \"a very big market share,\" which \"could be a problem.\" Netflix expressed confidence in the approval process, saying it expects the deal to close in 12 to 18 months, after WBD completes its spinoff of linear channels into a new company, Discovery Global.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Netflix said the deal would provide better choice and value for consumers by bringing together the Warner Bros. film and TV show libraries with its own offerings, and help the WBD's creators reach a bigger audience. Netflix said many of its subscribers don't \n\nWith Hollywood employment stagnating, Netflix also argued that the addition of Warner Bros. would let it expand its production and increase jobs over the long term. It expects to achieve $2 billion to $3 billion in cost savings from the deal, primarily coming from eliminating overlapping support staff. Sarandos contrasted this with a Paramount outcome.\n\n\"In the offer Paramount is talking about today, they're talking about $6 billion of synergies,\" he said at a UBS conference on Monday. \"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs. We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"",

The merger deal valued Skydance at $4.75 billion.\n\nIts biggest hit has been \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which became the second-highest-grossing film of 2022 after making almost $1.5 billion worldwide.\n\nAfter seeing the original \"Top Gun\" as a child, David Ellison became obsessed with flying. His billionaire father bought him a plane at the age of 13 and they took flying lessons together. By 17, Ellison had begun competing in air shows performing aerial acrobatics.\n\nHe gave up flying competitively after starting a film degree at USC that he later dropped out of, Ellison told Kara Swisher in an episode of The New York Times' \"Sway\" podcast.\n\nBefore becoming an entertainment executive, though, Ellison had a brief foray as an actor.\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in a Skydance film called \"Flyboys,\" about American pilots who flew for the French Air Force in World War I.\n\nThe movie cost about $65 million, but flopped after taking just $18 million or so, per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSince moving behind the camera, Ellison's company has had a relationship with Paramount that dates back to 2011 when Skydance co-financed Joel and Ethan Coen's \"True Grit\" with the studio.\n\nThe film was both a critical and commercial success, winning 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and taking about $200 million at the box office.\n\nEllison's sister, Megan, is also in the movie game. Her production company Annapurna Pictures was behind releases including \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" \"Her,\" \"American Hustle,\" and \"Phantom Thread,\" all of which received Oscar nominations.\n\nThe $8 billion tie-up of Skydance and Paramount officially closed in August. Ellison named himself chairman and CEO of the newly combined company, Paramount Skydance.\n\nSoon after taking the helm, Ellison led Paramount Skydance through layoffs, which can be common in the wake of a merger. The company laid off 1,000 employees in October and said that more cuts were coming. Six hundred employees took severance packages and quit instead of returning to the office, it said.\n\nEllison has also installed Bari Weiss at the top of CBS News. Weiss left The New York Times Opinion section in 2020 and later built the The Free Press, which Paramount Skydance acquired for about $150 million.\n\nEllison continued his spending run. He brought in Netflix veteran Cindy Holland and shelled out $7.7 billion for UFC rights.\n\n\"Everywhere you look, he's throwing money,\" LightShed Partners media analyst Rich Greenfield told Business Insider. \"That's what Hollywood gets excited about.\"\n\nNow, Ellison has his eye on another acquisition: Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nParamount Skydance had earlier entered a competitive bid against Netflix and Comcast to acquire the company.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery ultimately accepted Netflix's bid to purchase the company's streaming and studio business for $72 billion.\n\nEllison is now fighting to stop that from happening. On December 8, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile bid for WBD, offering to pay shareholders $30 per share for the entire company.\n\nThat morning, Ellison made his case to shareholders and WBD's board on CNBC.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"",

    "description": "Paramount's Larry and David Ellison are making a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Three of their partners are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.",
    "fullText": "The governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi want to invest billions of dollars into a would-be mega media conglomerate made up of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWhat would they get for their money?\n\nSpoiler: I don't know. And Paramount, the company that wants to use the three oil nations to help finance its bid for WBD, won't say.\n\nBut it sure seems like a question worth asking, as Paramount launches a hostile bid for WBD after losing last week's auction to Netflix.\n\nParamount says the three petrostates will be part of the new bid — as they were in Paramount's previous offers for WBD (something Paramount had at one point denied).\n\nAs of a week ago, those three countries were going to kick in $24 billion — double the $11.8 billion the Ellison family planned to invest in WBD.\n\nNow, Paramount won't say how much the three countries' sovereign wealth funds plan to invest in their newest proposal. It says Larry and David Ellison, who currently own Paramount, along with RedBird Capital, the private equity group, will \"backstop\" the deal — meaning they promise to finance all of it if necessary.\n\nBut Paramount still anticipates those three countries will ultimately invest in a combined Paramount/WBD, along with Jared Kushner — Donald Trump's son-in-law, whose Affinity Partners group invests money on behalf of … Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, among others.\n\nThe difference this time around, Paramount says, is that those countries' sovereign wealth funds won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would operate. They wouldn't get board seats, voting rights, or any other governance over the company. Paramount declined to comment.\n\nThe reason Paramount needs to stress that, apparently, is that Warner Bros. Discovery had previously flagged that as an issue. Now that the oil states won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would be run, Paramount says the deal wouldn't need approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a regulatory body that's supposed to sign off on foreign investments in some US companies.\n\nThat's all part of Paramount's pitch it is making to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders: A deal for Paramount to buy WBD will pass regulators much more easily than Netflix buying WBD.\n\nBut who knows how that will actually pan out? Up until last week, the conventional wisdom was that Paramount would be the most likely winner for WBD, in no small part because Larry Ellison was a longtime Donald Trump backer, and his son, David, had been trying to curry favor with Trump as well.\n\nNow it turns out that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was also wooing Trump. He visited Trump at the White House, and Trump seems to have been taken with him: \"He was in the Oval Office last week. I have a lot of respect for him. He is a great person,\" Trump told reporters Sunday night. \"Ted has really done a legendary job.\"\n\nSo in a world where Donald Trump is the most important decision-maker when it comes to what American companies are allowed to do, I don't know if the niceties of CFIUS rules will be the ultimate arbiter. (Here I'll note that last year the US passed a law that required China's ByteDance to divest itself of its ownership in the US. TikTok business or shut down. That hasn't happened, and TikTok is still alive and well in the U.S.)\n\nI also don't know if Trump will particularly care that three Middle Eastern oil states could conceivably own a big chunk of a conglomerate that includes CNN, CBS, HBO, and two movie studios. He has been quite eager to do deals in the Middle East, and last month he rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi crown prince at the White House.\n\nAnd perhaps that eagerness explains why Paramount didn't think it was a big deal to include petrostate investments in the past — and why it still thinks it's OK to have them now.\n\nBut again: If Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi are looking to put anything close to $24 billion into an enormously powerful media conglomerate — one with huge reach in both the US and ambitions for the rest of the world — will they be satisfied with purely financial returns? Or do they expect something else for their money?\n\nI'd love to know. Maybe you would, too.",

    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison has now made his pitch to buy Warner Bros. Discovery to that company's board and shareholders, as well as his own employees.\n\nEllison pitched Paramount employees about his renewed offer to buy WBD in an email sent just after 3 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison wrote in the memo to staffers, which was first obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe Paramount CEO said he believes his all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD is superior to Netflix's $27.75 offer for WBD's streaming and studio assets, including the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, and streamer HBO Max.\n\nParamount made a so-called hostile bid for WBD on Monday morning, hoping to get investors on its side.\n\nEllison is also trying to get his employees on board. He's selling them on a vision where a Paramount-WBD tie-up becomes a powerhouse capable of challenging Netflix and YouTube.\n\n\"Our motivation for pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery has been consistent from the start,\" Ellison wrote in the memo. \"We love this industry and believe deeply in its future.\"\n\nEllison also said that \"storytelling\" is \"one of America's greatest cultural and economic exports.\"\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos similarly made an America-focused pitch when he approached President Donald Trump about the deal, he said at an industry conference on Monday afternoon.\n\n\"What the president has been interested in, in this deal, has been: To what extent does it protect and create jobs in America?\" Sarandos said.\n\nNetflix has said its proposal would be best for consumers and the entertainment industry. Paramount has made the opposite argument.\n\nRead Ellison's full memo to Paramount employees below:",

    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance's bid to purchase Warner Bros. Discovery is a big deal — literally.\n\nThe all-cash offer of $30 per share works out to a valuation of more than $108 billion, or an equity valuation of $78.7 billion, for WBD's entire operation, putting it in the upper echelons of hostile takeover attempts in recent decades.\n\nIn fairness, the $82.7 billion deal, or $72 billion equity valuation, from streaming giant Netflix is also pretty massive. That was the one WBD's board had agreed on, and it excluded certain pieces of the business.\n\n\"We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.\" Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement.\n\nTo get a sense of the biggest hostile takeover deals of the past 30 years, Business Insider asked financial analytics provider Dealogic to pull the numbers.\n\nHere are the equity valuations of the 14 largest hostile takeover announcements since 1995, and where the Paramount deal for WBD would fit in.\n\nComcast launched an unsolicited bid for AT&T Broadband, which was then the largest cable operator in the US. After a few rounds of negotiations and pressure from shareholders, AT&T accepted the offer. The deal gave rise to Comcast's national expansion.\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Tesla made an unsolicited offer to buy Twitter after building a large stake. Twitter initially resisted, but eventually accepted the deal. Musk, however, tried to back out of the deal and was met with litigation, before eventually closing the takeover he started. Musk had since then changed the platform's algorithm, its name, and content moderation rules.\n\nIn what was at the time Europe's largest hostile takeover, RBS and Bank of Scotland fought in a bidding war for NatWest, which ended with RBS's victory through a hostile offer. The deal helped RBS become a global banking giant, but at the cost of taking on excessive debt. RBS collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nRoche, which already owned a majority stake in Genentech, launched a hostile bid for full ownership. The biotech company initially resisted the attempt due to undervaluation. After raising the offer, Roche succeeded.\n\nBAT made an unsolicited offer to buy the remainder of Reynolds, after already owning a large stake in it. Reynolds negotiated a higher price but ultimately accepted the takeover. The deal created the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company at the time.\n\nBelgium's InBev made a hostile offer for Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of beer brand Budweiser. AB's management and founding family initially resisted being taken over by a foreign company, but shareholders pressured them to accept after InBev raised its bid.\n\nBayer made an unsolicited offer to Monsanto, and the chemical company held out for a higher price before accepting the deal. Unfortunately for Bayer, the German biotech company also inherited lawsuits against Monsanto's Roundup herbicide.\n\nTotalFina launched a hostile bid for Elf in a dramatic French corporate battle. After nearly a year of fighting and regulatory scrutiny, the companies merged and became one of the world's biggest oil companies. The combined entity was eventually renamed as TotalEnergies.\n\nJapanese company Takeda made a series of unsolicited bids for UK-based Shire. Shire repeatedly rejected the deal until Takeda substantially increased the offer. This is one of the largest acquisitions ever made by a Japanese company, and it gave Takeda a large rare disease drug portfolio.\n\nSanofi's unsolicited takeover was met with strong resistance from Aventis, so much so that the company sought to be acquired by a different pharmaceutical giant, Novartis. Sanofi sweetened the offer, and Aventis eventually accepted it.\n\nParamount launched its hostile takeover bid after WBD's board bypassed its offers in favor of a deal with Netflix.\n\nPfizer launched a hostile bid to break apart Warner-Lambert's agreed merger with American Home Products. Warner-Lambert fought back but ultimately conceded. This gave Pfizer full ownership of Lipitor, which holds the record for the highest lifetime sales for a single drug.\n\nImmediately before the 2008 financial crisis, Barclays tried to acquire ABN AMRO amicably, but RBS, alongside Fortis and Banco Santander, countered with a hostile, higher bid and won. The acquisition sped up RBS's collapse soon after.\n\nIn a move that consolidated much of the world's beer industry under one entity, AB InBev launched a hostile offer for SABMiller, eventually raising the bid to satisfy resistant shareholders.\n\nUK company Vodafone AirTouch launched a hostile bid for German company Mannesmann, which had rapidly become one of Europe's most valuable telecom companies. Mannesmann fiercely resisted, framing the bid as an attack on German industrial values and national pride. The record-setting battle lasted three months, ending with Vodafone winning by raising the bid.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he wanted to \"do what's right\" in the media war brewing between Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix said that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion. WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.\n\nIn response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well. I know what they're doing, but I have to see, I have to see what percentage of market they have.\"\n\n\"We have to see the Netflix percentage of market, Paramount, the percentage of market,\" he said during a roundtable at the White House. \"I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to do what's right. It's so, so very important to do what's right,\" he added.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he would be involved in the sale of WBD, and that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"\n\nBut he also said that Netflix's CEO, Ted Sarandos, was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"\n\nTrump's involvement in the media war is significant because he has the authority to stop a deal from taking place. In 2017, he voiced his opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.\n\nBusiness Insider's media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, wrote in a column last week that a deal to buy WBD would need regulatory approval, which in 2025 is synonymous with Trump's approval.\n\nParamount is putting up a strong fight for Warner Bros. Its CEO, David Ellison, pitched the WBD offer to his employees in a Monday memo seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison's memo wrote.",
