    "description": "Paramount Skydance is still trying to stop Warner Bros. Discovery's Netflix deal. Here are the four most likely endings in the fight for WBD.",
    "fullText": "The war for Warner Bros. Discovery is getting intense.\n\nParamount Skydance isn't surrendering in its quest to buy WBD, even though its offers have been rejected eight times in favor of Netflix's bid.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison has criticized WBD for not selecting what he's called \"by far the superior offer.\"\n\nWBD has fired back, accusing Paramount of threatening lawsuits and leaking to the press. The company's board of directors said this week in a letter to shareholders that Paramount \"has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction.\"\n\nThere have been many twists and turns in Netflix and Paramount's battle for WBD, and the drama isn't over yet.\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios that could unfold.\n\nAlthough Paramount says its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD provides more value and less risk than Netflix's $27.75-per-share bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets, the company could up the ante.\n\nSeveral media insiders, including Disney's former top dealmaker, expect a renewed bidding war for WBD.\n\nTheir view got a boost when Paramount disclosed in a filing that Ellison had texted WBD CEO David Zaslav, saying that Paramount's $30-per-share proposal wasn't its \"best and final\" offer.\n\nWBD investors also seem to be counting on more fireworks, given that its stock is trading north of $28.50, close to $1 per share above Netflix's agreed-upon purchase price. That suggests shareholders believe either Ellison and company or Netflix will fork over more money before WBD changes hands.\n\nParamount might not need to offer another penny if a majority of WBD's shareholders tender their shares, which would put pressure on the board to reconsider its proposal.\n\nAs a public company, WBD's leadership is legally required to act in the best interests of its shareholders. Otherwise, its board could be sued. So, if WBD's investors overwhelmingly prefer Paramount's bid, the board could have no choice but to go with it.\n\nHowever, Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at Lightshed Partners, thinks Paramount won't convince a majority of WBD shareholders to tender their shares. Greenfield predicted that Paramount would then raise its offer to $32 per share, but that Netflix would respond by sweetening its offer, leading to Paramount eventually dropping its bid.\n\nUntil the Netflix deal closes, a competing proposal could come in, since WBD is a public company. Comcast drove up the eventual price of Disney's acquisition of Fox's studio by nearly $20 billion, even though its rival bid came in six months later.\n\nIf Paramount remains adamant that it has a superior proposal that wasn't chosen, it could sue WBD's board of directors, alleging negligence.\n\nWBD has acknowledged that possibility. Paramount \"has been aggressive in its engagement with WBD, has retained litigation counsel and has threatened litigation,\" WBD's board of directors wrote in a letter on Wednesday in which it rejected Paramount's latest offer.\n\nLawyer Raul Gastesi of Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella has taken note of Paramount's litigious posture and said that now that it has been turned down, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit.\"\n\nHowever, Reuben Miller, the head of antitrust at data intelligence firm Dealreporter, said that while Paramount is making waves in the court of public opinion, he believes they \"would rather come with an increased offer and avoid litigation than roll the dice in Delaware court.\"\n\nEven if Paramount decides not to sue, there's a chance WBD shareholders could take legal action against WBD's board.\n\nWhile Paramount has taken a hands-on approach to its WBD bid so far, it could let the chips fall and move on if its proposal doesn't win over enough WBD shareholders.\n\nInstead of spending more than $100 billion on WBD, Paramount could put money toward another acquisition, or simply invest in improving its technology and original content.",

    "fullText": "The head of Paramount Skydance's streaming product and tech is leaving the company, Business Insider has learned.\n\nVibol Hou told colleagues in the company's streaming tech Slack channel that he's leaving Paramount at the end of January.\n\n\"After nearly 12 years of exhilarating work pushing our businesses to new heights, it feels like the right time to hand the torch to the next wave of leaders while I take a much-needed pause to rest, focus on my health (including some serious marathon training), and spend more time with my family before I jump into whatever comes next,\" Hou wrote in the Slack message, which was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHou's exit has been anticipated within Paramount for months.\n\nIn Hou's Slack message, he referenced a previous memo from Dane Glasgow, Paramount's chief product officer, that hinted at the move.\n\n\"Vibol has expressed interest in exploring other opportunities, and while he will remain in his role with an anticipated transition early next year, we will continue to explore new projects together,\" Glasgow wrote in a mid-October email viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHou was at Paramount or its subsidiaries for over a decade, including six years at its free streamer, Pluto TV. In that span, Paramount went through several corporate changes, from a ViacomCBS merger to the Paramount Skydance merger that closed in the summer of 2025.\n\n\"What we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy,\" Hou wrote in the Slack message. \"But we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver.\"\n\nHou's Slack message was received warmly, with 118 \"care\" emojis, 67 classic \"red heart\" emojis, and 43 \"thank you\" emojis, among other signals of support as of early Thursday afternoon.\n\nSince Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison took over in early August, he's made several noteworthy moves, like landing UFC rights in the US and hiring Bari Weiss to lead CBS News.\n\nSeveral top executives have left the company as Ellison has taken control, including co-CEOs Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins, streaming head Tom Ryan, and international markets head Pam Kaufman.\n\nEllison is now focused on buying Warner Bros. Discovery, which has rejected its takeover offer eight times.\n\nParamount did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead Hou's Slack message to colleagues announcing the move:\n\nAs Dane shared in his note, I'll be transitioning out of my role and leaving the company at the end of January. After nearly 12 years of exhilarating work pushing our businesses to new heights, it feels like the right time to hand the torch to the next wave of leaders while I take a much-needed pause to rest, focus on my health (including some serious marathon training), and spend more time with my family before I jump into whatever comes next.\n\nWhat we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy — but we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver. Yet again and again, this team showed grit, creativity, and passion. Whether you came from Pluto or another part of Streaming, the story is the same: we took on impossible problems and innovated our way through.\n\nThe culture we live — being curious about everything, feeling that hunger to solve problems, caring deeply for others, iterating constantly, and innovating in everything we do — belongs to all of you now. You should be proud of what you've achieved, and you should be confident that this is a team that can handle anything thrown its way.\n\nAs to the future, I have a lot of confidence in Dane and the vision and strategic pillars he's laid out for the year ahead. They set a strong foundation for where this organization can go over the next several years, and I'm excited to see what you all do together under his leadership.\n\nI plan to hold my last open office hours next Friday so anyone who wants to drop in, ask questions, or just say hello/goodbye has a space to do that together. In the meantime, if you'd like to stay in touch beyond my time here, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.\n\nServing alongside you has been one of the great privileges of my life, and I'll be proudly cheering you on as you write the next chapter together.",

    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's leveraged buyout bid again, citing financial and litigation risk",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board raised its hackles on Wednesday while rejecting Paramount Skydance's bid for the eighth time in favor of Netflix's offer.\n\nWBD used pointed language, calling Paramount's bid the \"largest leveraged buyout in history by a wide margin\" and tying its potential failure to previous big LBOs that didn't close on the initially agreed-upon terms.\n\nIn its new filing, WBD also described Paramount's financial condition as \"not strong,\" noting that its credit was already rated \"junk\" by S&P before the \"extraordinary amount of debt financing\" required by the deal. Paramount, for its part, has emphasized that $40.4 billion in equity of its new bid is fully backstopped by Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nWBD's strong language suggests that the board and leadership \"just want to move on,\" and the \"largest LBO\" angle is a new and compelling one, Wharton M&A professor Paul Nary said on X.\n\nDavid Zaslav-led WBD also ramped up its accusations that Paramount has acted litigiously and leaked to the press.\n\nIn the filing, WBD cited new press reports in the New York Post indicating Paramount was considering abandoning its offer and might pursue \"DefCon 1\" litigation against WBD's board. WBD said that Paramount didn't deny the reports, suggesting that the company was leaking to the press. WBD had previously complained that there had been \"extensive media leaks and rumors\" about Paramount's proposals.\n\nM&A experts said the stepped-up language was likely drafted in anticipation of a lawsuit against WBD, either by Paramount or WBD shareholders.\n\nNow that Paramount has lost to Netflix, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit,\" said Raul Gastesi, a partner at Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella.\n\nCorey Martin, managing partner of Granderson Des Rochers, a law firm focused on entertainment and media, said the new filing felt calibrated to deter WBD shareholders from backing Paramount's hostile bid.\n\n\"The audience is really the shareholders, because there's always the risk of shareholder lawsuits,\" Martin said. \"It is colorful stuff, but Paramount's is a hostile bid.\"\n\nMartin also saw the emphasis on legal and press tactics as part of a PR strategy to portray Paramount as a bad actor, as well as a pre-litigation tactic.\n\nLightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a note on Wednesday that Paramount could still outbid Netflix, but it would \"require an overhaul of their current bid, and a dramatic increase in the cash invested from the Ellison family and/or their friends and financing partners.\"",

    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery just rejected David Ellison's takeover offer for the eighth time — and its CEO is telling employees why.\n\nWBD CEO David Zaslav sent a companywide memo on Wednesday morning, which was viewed by Business Insider, explaining why WBD is sticking with its Netflix deal.\n\nZaslav told staffers that WBD's board of directors did a \"thorough review\" of Paramount's latest offer and said they believe Netflix's offer is still superior.\n\n\"This review was conducted with discipline and rigor, and was supported by independent financial and legal advisors,\" Zaslav told employees.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders on Wednesday, WBD's board outlined two key reasons it was turning down Paramount's updated offer. First, the board said it offered \"insufficient value\" relative to Netflix's bid, due to additional costs like a break-up fee to Netflix. Second, they said there was a \"lack of certainty\" in Paramount's ability to consummate the deal because of an \"extraordinary amount of debt financing.\"\n\nParamount's latest deal had included $40.4 billion in equity fully backstopped by Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison and one of the richest people in the world.\n\nIn Zaslav's memo to staffers, he said the company's \"operating plans remain unchanged, and our priorities for 2026 are clear and intentional.\"\n\nWBD's CEO also encouraged employees to tune out the noise.\n\n\"What matters most right now is our focus as we start the year,\" Zaslav said, before thanking staffers for the \"focus, professionalism, and energy\" they bring to work.\n\nHe said the 2026 goals process for the company would launch in February.\n\nRead Zaslav's full memo to staffers here:\n\nThis communication has been sent to everyone at WBD.\n\nAs we begin the year, I want to share an update on where things stand and where we are focused.\n\nFollowing a thorough review, the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors has completed its consideration of Paramount Skydance's most recent proposal. After careful evaluation, the Board has determined not to pursue that proposal. You can read our statement here.\n\nThis review was conducted with discipline and rigor, and was supported by independent financial and legal advisors.\n\nWe continue to have a signed transaction agreement with Netflix, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The regulatory review process is underway, and during this period we will continue to operate the business and support our teams. For reference, a centralized collection of what we have previously shared on this topic is available on the One website.\n\nWhat matters most right now is our focus as we start the year. Our operating plans remain unchanged, and our priorities for 2026 are clear and intentional. The 2026 Goals process will be launched in February.\n\nAcross film, television, sports, news, streaming and games, we are delivering against a slate and strategy we believe strongly in. The work underway across the company reflects the creativity, momentum, and global reach that define us.\n\nThank you for the focus, professionalism, and energy you bring to your work. We enter this year confident in our direction and energized by what we are building for audiences and partners around the world.",

    "fullText": "Paramount+ just added a major “plus” for fans of mixed martial arts. Come Saturday, January 24, 2026, the streaming service will be the exclusive home of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) events in the United States and Latin America. Now, instead of paying to watch each bout on pay-per-view television, UFC devotees can \n\nThe new arrangement comes after TKO Group Holdings, UFC’s parent company, announced a $7.7 billion deal with Paramount, a Skydance corporation, this August. That deal, which will run through 2033, “will unlock greater accessibility and discoverability for sports fans and provide an important catalyst for driving engagement and further subscriber growth for Paramount+,” according to a press release.\n\nFans will no longer need to use pay-per-view to watch UFC bouts. Starting January 24, Paramount+ subscribers will be able to watch UFC’s full slate of 13 marquee numbered events and all 30 of UFC’s 2026 Fight Night events on the streaming service, with no extra charge on top of their Paramount+ subscriptions, as the service explains. Plus, select marquee fights will be simulcast on CBS under the new deal.\n\nParamount+ offers two plans: an ad-supported Essential plan and an ad-free Premium plan. Starting January 15, the Essential plan will cost $9 per month or $90 per year, while the Essentials plan will cost $14 per month or $140 per year, per CNET. Those prices are more expensive than they were in 2025 but still represent a bargain for UFC fans, considering UFC’s pay-per-view model with ESPN cost viewers $79.99 per event last year, according to SB Nation.\n\nIn a press release about the streaming deal, UFC hyped up its UFC 324 event, which will officially kick off the organization’s Paramount+ era on Saturday, January 2024. UFC 324 will be headlined by two marquee showdowns, one in which UFC lightweight champion and former BMF titleholder Justin Gaethje faces Paddy “The Baddy” Pimblett in an interim UFC lightweight title fight. In the other, UFC women’s bantamweight champion Kayla Harrison fights UFC Hall of Famer Amanda Nunes, who is returning to the Octagon for the first time since 2023.\n\nAs of December 18, Paramount+’s UFC 2026 schedule showed the following events (with a disclaimer that all fight cards, dates, and times are subject to change):\n\nSaturday, January 24, 2026 — UFC 324: Gaethje vs. Pimblett\n T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas, Nevada\n Early prelims: 5/4c\n Prelims: 7/6c\n Main card: 9/8c\n\nSaturday, January 31, 2026 — UFC 325: Volkanovski vs. Lopes 2\n Qudos Bank Arena, Sydney Olympic Park NSW, Australia\n Early prelims: 5/4c\n Prelims: 7/6c\n Main card: 9/8c\n\nSaturday, February 7, 2026 — UFC Fight Night: Bautista vs. Oliveira \n UFC Apex, Las Vegas, Nevada\n Prelims: 6/5c\n Main card: 9/8c\n\nSaturday, February 21, 2026 — UFC Fight Night: Strickland vs. Hernandez \n Toyota Center, Houston, Texas\n Prelims: 6/5c\n Main card: 9/8c\n\nSaturday, February 28, 2026 — UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Almabayev \n Arena CDMX, Mexico City, Mexico\n Prelims: 6/5c\n Main card: 9/8c\n\nSaturday, March 7, 2026 — UFC 326: Holloway vs. Oliveira 2 \n T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas, Nevada\n Early prelims: TBA\n Prelims: TBA\n Main card: TBA\n\nSaturday, March 14, 2026 — UFC Fight Night\n UFC Apex, Las Vegas, Nevada\n Prelims: TBA\n Main card: TBA\n\nSaturday, March 21, 2026 — UFC Fight Night\n The O2, London, England\n Prelims: TBA\n Main card: TBA\n\nSaturday, March 28, 2026 — UFC Fight Night\n Climate Pledge Arena, Seattle, Washington\n Prelims: TBA\n Main card: TBA\n\nUFC 324: Gaethje vs. Pimblett, Streaming, Sunday, January 24, 9/8c, Paramount+\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

The decision came in early September, less than a month after CEO David Ellison took charge after the Paramount-Skydance merger.\n\nStaffers who weren't up for in-person work were offered a severance package, which about 600 employees took, Paramount said in its third-quarter shareholder letter in mid-November.\n\nSome Paramount staff members can continue to work from home for now, including those based outside the US and those who were hired for fully remote roles. These employees who aren't assigned to the NY or LA offices will hear about \"Phase Two\" of Paramount's return-to-office plan in 2026, Ellison told employees in his September memo.\n\nParamount has been preparing its offices in NY and LA for an influx of remote workers by having employees in those areas work from home throughout December.\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal followed in Paramount's footsteps, telling employees to report to its office four days per week starting January 5, 2026. NBCU staffers can still work from home on Fridays.\n\n\"In-person work and collaboration spark innovation, promote creativity, and build stronger connections,\" NBCU operating chief Adam Miller said in a memo to staffers about the change.\n\nNBCU also gave a severance offer to employees who weren't willing to return to the office. Notably, this exit package was one-size-fits-all, meaning that it wasn't dependent on how long staffers had worked for the parent of Peacock and Universal Studios.\n\nDisney's return-to-office edict came nearly three years ago in early 2023, when CEO Bob Iger called most Mouse House staffers back to the office four days a week.\n\n\"It is my belief that working together more in-person will benefit the company's creativity, culture, and our employees' careers,\" Iger told employees at the time.\n\nHowever, Disney's remote work policy isn't always enforced equally. Some staffers have told Business Insider that their managers strictly enforce the four-day rule, while others have said that their bosses are more lax about badge swipes.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery requires most of its employees to work in person three days a week, with a work-from-home option on the other two days.\n\nHowever, that policy could change if the company behind HBO and Warner Bros. Studios were bought by either Netflix or Paramount Skydance.\n\nYouTube-parent Google's remote work policy may be confusing, but it offers a certain level of flexibility.\n\nThe tech giant's remote work policy lets employees work from home two days a week. It also offers a \"Work From Anywhere\" program, allowing staff members to telecommute for four weeks a year.\n\nGoogle revised that \"Work From Anywhere\" policy this fall, CNBC reported, citing an internal memo telling employees that using one so-called \"WFA\" day in a week would count as using an entire week. That's because these \"WFA\" weeks are intended for use when employees work away from their homes or worksites, and not as a substitute for a work-from-home or paid-time-off day.\n\n\"The policy was always intended to be taken in increments of a week and not be used as a substitute for working from home in a regular hybrid workweek,\" John Casey, Google's VP of performance and rewards, said of the change in a call with employees, CNBC reported.\n\nNetflix hasn't set a companywide work-site policy, meaning that employees can be fully remote, work in the office every day, or anywhere in between.\n\nEmployees' working locations can vary by team and position, which a Netflix spokesperson said gives teams \"the information and freedom to make decisions that best suit their type of work.\"\n\nThat relaxed remote work policy has long been common among tech companies, though that's starting to shift — even at video-conference giant Zoom.",

    "description": "A Paramount manager had 11 days to decide: return to the office five days a week — or take severance. He explains why he chose to walk away.",
    "fullText": "In September, Ron Telemarque was given 11 days to make a difficult decision: leave his job at Paramount Skydance — or prepare to work from the office five days a week. He's confident he made the right choice.\n\nFor the first half of this year, Telemarque commuted to the office two days a week in his role as senior manager of deal finance strategy. When management changes tied to the company's merger bumped that up to three days for his team starting in September, Telemarque and his wife began preparing a childcare plan for their four-year-old daughter on the days he'd have to make the 90-minute, one-way commute.\n\nBut on September 4, their plans were scrambled. David Ellison, who became CEO in August following the merger's closing, issued an ultimatum to most employees: return to the office five days a week starting in January, or accept a severance package by September 15.\n\n\"They dropped the bomb: 'Hey, it's five days a week — take it or leave it,'\" Telemarque said.\n\nOver the past year, Business Insider has spoken with more than a dozen workers like Telemarque who have been affected by return-to-office mandates. Several large employers — including Amazon, JPMorgan, AT&T, and Microsoft — have rolled back remote work policies, prompting some employees to reconsider where they live, how they manage childcare, and whether to stay in their jobs.\n\nWhile some workers are happy to return to the office for camaraderie and a change of scenery, others have requested flexibility from their managers or parted ways with their employers. At Paramount, about 600 employees accepted severance packages after the company announced its new five-day office policy. In the September 4 memo to employees, Ellison said that \"in-person collaboration is absolutely vital to building and strengthening our culture and driving the success of our business.\"\n\nTelemarque shared the personal and professional factors he weighed when deciding whether to stay at Paramount — and how he feels about that choice months later.\n\nWhen Telemarque joined Paramount, then called ViacomCBS, in 2021, he worked remotely with the understanding that he'd eventually be required to follow a hybrid schedule. This ultimately meant commuting to the company's Manhattan office two days a week, starting in early 2022.\n\nTelemarque said the two-day commute from Stamford, where he and his wife began renting in 2020, included a 20-minute walk to the train station, a 45- to 50-minute train ride, and another 20-minute walk from Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nHe said the commute was manageable from both a personal and childcare standpoint for him and his wife, who works remotely as a full-time marketing director. Telemarque would drop off their daughter at preschool and handle other childcare duties on Mondays and Fridays, while his wife covered those responsibilities on the days he commuted.\n\n\"With that kind of work style, I could do it because my commute, though long, still felt doable,\" said the 41-year-old.\n\nHowever, Telemarque wasn't sure he could manage a five-day commute. It was a question he was forced to confront in early September, when he learned he had 11 days to decide whether to accept a severance package — which, for him, included two months of pay — or prepare for a full-time return to the office in January.\n\nOne major consideration was how a five-day commute would affect the time he spent with his daughter, whom he already saw less in the mornings and evenings on the days he commuted. He added that his job sometimes required evening work, but the ability to work from home had made those days more manageable. Under the new policy, he figured he'd likely be spending more of those late hours in the office — and away from his daughter.\n\n\"For me to be at the office, that means I'm going to get up early, probably not see my kid, and then when I come back, they're probably in bed,\" he said.\n\nAnother consideration was how the new schedule would affect his wife, who would have to take on more childcare responsibilities. While her ability to work remotely provided some flexibility, Telemarque said there's a chance she could also eventually face a return-to-office mandate.\n\nThere was also the question of whether they'd be willing to move closer to Manhattan to shorten his commute — a decision that could mean breaking their lease before it ended the following August, finding a new home, and enrolling their daughter in a new school.\n\nAs Telemarque weighed his options, he said it felt like the September 15 decision deadline was approaching fast. He struggled to get comfortable with the lifestyle adjustments a five-day commute would require — and how he and his wife could make it work.\n\nBeyond the logistics, Telemarque said he also felt uneasy about the direction Paramount was heading under its new leadership. He found it somewhat frustrating that he had performed well enough to earn a promotion in a hybrid environment — yet couldn't retain that flexibility under the company's new expectations.\n\nUltimately, he decided to take the severance package and leave the company.\n\n\"I didn't have enough time,\" he said. \"So my best bet was to take the package.\"\n\nTelemarque said he worked through the end of October before officially parting ways with the company and turning his attention to finding his next role.\n\nOver the last few months, Telemarque has been targeting roles related to strategy, finance, and distribution within the media and entertainment industry. He said he's focused on remote and hybrid roles, but would be open to a fully in-office position if the commute was short enough and the compensation made it worthwhile.\n\nTelemarque said he's still looking for an offer and that he's feeling some financial pressure to find work.\n\n\"It's stressful having to network and trying to get a job,\" he said.\n\nBut even as his search continues, Telemarque still feels leaving Paramount was the right choice.\n\n\"I feel good about my decision, but the predicament I was in was unfortunate,\" he said. \"If I had had a better option, would I have made it? Yes. But that was the best outcome.\"",

    "title": "Billionaire Larry Ellison comes to his son’s rescue, agreeing to personally guarantee over $40 billion to finance Paramount’s bid for Warner Bros.",
    "description": "Warner Bros. is in the middle of a tug-of-war between Netflix and David Ellison’s company, Paramount Skydance.",
    "fullText": "Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison is raising the stakes in the battle for Hollywood’s future, personally intervening to salvage his son David Ellison’s hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. On Monday, David’s company, Paramount Skydance, announced the elder Ellison had provided an “irrevocable personal guarantee” of $40.4 billion to finance the deal, directly countering claims that the company’s funding was unreliable.​\n\nIt’s the latest turn in the high-profile tug-of-war for Warner Bros. Discovery, one of the entertainment industry’s crown jewels. David Ellison, who became CEO of the newly merged Paramount Skydance in August, has been aggressively pursuing Warner Bros. with a $108 billion all-cash offer, which comes out to about $30 per share. However, WBD’s board rejected that proposal in favor of a rival agreement to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix for roughly $83 billion.​\n\nThe board’s rejection hinged largely on skepticism regarding the Ellison family’s financing. Last week, WBD directors dismissed Paramount’s funding as “illusory,” citing concerns that the capital was tied to a “revocable family trust” that could be altered or withdrawn before the deal closed. Larry Ellison’s Monday filing was designed to silence those doubts.\n\n“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” the company said in a statement, adding that the tech tycoon has agreed “not to revoke the Ellison family trust (which has been operating for nearly 40 years as a counterparty to numerous transactions) or adversely transfer its assets during the pendency of the transaction.”​\n\nThis massive personal commitment—roughly one-sixth of Larry Ellison’s $247.3 billion estimated net worth—effectively removes the WBD board’s primary defense against the takeover. To further sweeten the pot, Paramount raised its proposed breakup fee to $5.8 billion, matching the termination fee included in the rival Netflix offer.​\n\nDavid Ellison argued that his company’s bid remains the only path that preserves Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole entity, rather than selling it off in parts. Netflix’s planned acquisition would exclude WBD’s Global Networks division, which includes CNN and other cable-native brands, and which WBD had previously announced plans to spin off.\n\n“Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on Dec. 4th, and continues to be the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders,” David Ellison said in a statement Monday. “We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”​",

    "description": "A new filing says Paramount offered pay and a job to WBD CEO David Zaslav, and gives other takeaways from the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery didn't just reject Paramount again on Wednesday. It also pulled back the curtain on what the bidding war was like behind the scenes.\n\nWBD advised shareholders to dismiss Paramount's $30-per-share offer for the company and stick with Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share (for only its studios and streaming business). In a filing, WBD's board called Paramount's latest bid inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on shareholders compared to Netflix's bid, which it said offered superior value and more certainty.\n\nSome of the information in the filing had already been made public, but it revealed some juicy bits that haven't been reported.\n\nHere are the top six takeaways:\n\nRight after WBD rejected one of multiple secret bids in September, David Ellison called Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav to request that Zaslav meet with his father, Larry Ellison. The conventional wisdom was that the Oracle cofounder's billions would prevail. In the end, that didn't happen. WBD expressed concern that the bid relied on a revocable trust, whose assets or liabilities were subject to change.\n\nWe already knew Zaslav stood to make over $500 million from a Paramount deal, based mainly on his shares that would vest immediately after it closed ($567,712,631, to be exact, according to the filing). Zaslav told the WBD board that the Ellisons had \"indicated to him that\" if a deal went through, he would \"receive a compensation package worth several hundred million dollars,\" per the filing. Zaslav responded that it \"would be inappropriate to discuss any such arrangements at that time,\" he told the board.\n\nParamount also offered Zaslav the position of co-CEO and co-chairman of the combined company, a role Netflix didn't offer, the filing said.\n\nThat runs contrary to the narrative put forth in a letter Paramount's attorneys at Quinn Emanuel sent to WBD, stating they suspected the process was biased in favor of Netflix due to WBD leadership's expectations that there could be roles for them at the new company. Paramount's legal and financial advisors didn't know about the \"December 3 Quinn Emanuel\" letter and, in their view, the letter should not have been sent, was \"not helpful,\" and was a \"mistake,\" the filing says.\n\nThe filing revealed the presence of a fourth, previously unknown bidder in the process, \"Company C,\" which proposed acquiring WBD's cable channels and 20% of its streaming and studio businesses for $25 billion in cash.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Company C was Starz. Business Insider was unable to independently confirm that. Starz declined to comment.\n\nWBD determined that the Company C bid was \"not actionable\" and continued to work with Netflix, Paramount, and \"Company A\" (clearly Comcast).\n\nSome of Wall Street's marquee names — Allen & Co., J.P. Morgan, and Evercore — are set to make a total of $225 million in connection with WBD's sale to Netflix or Paramount, if a deal goes through, according to the filing.\n\nThe good times are poised to continue: Media and telecoms M&A deal value rose 61% in the past year, excluding the announced WBD sale, and the momentum should keep going in the years ahead, helped by investor appetite for valuable IP, according to PwC.\n\nThe Ellisons wanted to use $24 billion from Middle Eastern sources to fund their bid. That would seem to raise a whole host of concerns, not the least of which is that they'd be buying CNN and some of that money would come from Saudi Arabia's government, which US intelligence said killed a Washington Post journalist in 2018.\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka noted, however, that the issues WBD says the foreign money raised were \"presented as technical hurdles\" in the filing and \"not moral or patriotic dealbreakers.\"\n\nA big question around the dueling bids was which company would have a better chance of surviving regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBoth Paramount and Netflix made their cases, arguing that they'd sail through the process, while the other bidder would encounter issues.\n\nParamount said a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal would harm consumers and Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the well-stocked Warner Bros. library. Netflix, for its part, has argued that a combination of Paramount and WBD would actually be larger than its own proposed new entity, as measured by total US TV viewing time.\n\nNone of this seemed to be a chief concern for the WBD board, though.\n\n\"The WBD Board further took into account advice of WBD's regulatory advisors that regulatory risk was not a material differentiating factor between\" the Paramount and Netflix proposals, the filing said.\n\nThe wild card is Trump, though, who has close ties to the Ellisons but hasn't come down firmly on either side publicly.",

    "fullText": "Larry and David Ellison, who own Paramount, want to use $24 billion in Middle Eastern money to finance their bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. Is that a problem for WBD?\n\nYou might think so — especially since $10 billion of that came from the Saudi government. That's the same government that US intelligence said killed a Washington Post journalist in 2018. The kind of partner you might think a major American media conglomerate would want to keep at arm's length.\n\nBut that's not a problem WBD raises in its newest communication to shareholders, where it urges them to take the deal offered by Netflix instead.\n\nWhat actually worries WBD about the Ellisons' bid isn't the Ellisons' particular partners. It's that the Ellisons had partners.\n\nIn a regulatory filing that tells the backstory of the proposed WBD sale, WBD execs and their reps repeatedly told the Ellisons they wanted a firm commitment that Larry Ellison — currently the world's 5th-richest man, with an estimated net worth of $243 billion — would guarantee the deal himself.\n\nInstead, WBD argues, the Ellisons never gave them the assurances they wanted.\n\nThe filing does bring up the fact that money from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds would likely complicate regulatory issues for a proposed Ellison/Paramount deal. (Ditto for a proposed $1 billion investment from China's Tencent, which the Ellisons later took out of their proposal.) But those are presented as technical hurdles. Not moral or patriotic dealbreakers.\n\nAnd they're just part of a laundry list of complaints WBD makes about the Ellisons. Among them: A December 2 tweet from New York Post reporter Charlie Gasparino, which WBD said violated a confidentiality agreement Paramount had signed.\n\nAnd when it comes to the main pitch WBD is making to investors, all of that stuff disappears. It just boils down to \"we did our homework, and the Netflix deal is better.\"\n\nThat's not shocking: If you're a WBD investor, you are (supposedly) only interested in getting the maximum value for shares. And WBD's filing argues that Netflix is the one that can pay the most.\n\nNow we're waiting to see what the Ellisons do next: Many observers believe they'll return with yet another, higher bid. Will this one have Gulf money, too?",

    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount Skydance and CEO David Ellison again. Read WBD's full letter to shareholders.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery still isn't interested in Paramount Skydance's offer.\n\nParamount's latest bid \"is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders\" compared to Netflix's bid, which \"represents superior, more certain value for our shareholders,\" said Samuel Di Piazza, the chair of WBD's board of directors, in a statement to shareholders on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, WBD's board recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's all-cash bid of $30 per share in favor of Netflix's cash-and-stock offer. Paramount wants to buy all of WBD, including its cable channels, while Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share is for WBD's studio, HBO, and HBO Max. A key difference between the two bids revolves around the value of WBD's TV networks, such as CNN and TNT, which Netflix isn't interested in buying.\n\nDi Piazza said that Paramount's seventh proposal \"once again fails to address key concerns that we have consistently communicated,\" including about Paramount's financing.\n\nParamount has said its bid is fully backstopped by Larry Ellison, one of the richest people in the world and father to Paramount CEO David Ellison. The WBD board said in the letter to shareholders that it relies \"on an unknown and opaque revocable trust\" whose assets or liabilities are subject to change.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix is paying with cash and stock. Its shares have fallen recently but surged more than 600% from mid-2022 to mid-2025. Netflix has a market cap of over $400 billion.\n\nWhile Paramount has said that it would have an easier time securing regulatory approval than Netflix, the WBD board says it \"does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk\" between the two proposals.\n\nThe Ellisons are close to President Donald Trump. However, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has pitched the president on the deal and seems to have earned some respect. Trump has called Sarandos a \"great person,\" though he added that the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal \"could be a problem\" on the regulatory front. Still, the president hasn't come out publicly in favor of one side in the deal.\n\nWBD also said its board \"repeatedly engaged\" with interested parties, including the Ellisons. Paramount had previously said that WBD went quiet late in the bidding process.\n\nNot even Paramount can be surprised by WBD's decision to stick with its Netflix deal.\n\nDavid Ellison was overheard saying last week that if WBD's leadership were to \"accept the offer exactly as it is today, right, then they're admitting breach of fiduciary duty,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThat's because Paramount said its $30-per-share hostile bid was nearly identical to its previous offer to WBD. Public companies are obligated to act in the best interests of shareholders. So if WBD's board had changed its mind, it could have opened itself up to shareholder lawsuits.\n\nWBD had said in a statement after Paramount's hostile bid that it would \"carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer\" in a way that was \"consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors.\"\n\nNow that WBD's board has given Paramount the cold shoulder again, it's Ellison's move.\n\nThe aspiring media mogul told CEO David Zaslav that Paramount's latest offer wasn't its \"best and final,\" which suggests that a higher bid could be coming. Just how much appetite Paramount has to escalate the bidding war is the key question.\n\nIf no higher bid comes, WBD's investors have until January 8 to back Paramount, though it could extend that deadline. WBD would owe Netflix a $2.8 billion reverse breakup fee if its shareholders chose Paramount.\n\nRead the full letter to shareholders here:\n\nAs your Board of Directors, we are committed to acting in your best interest. In this spirit, in October, we launched a public review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. This followed three separate proposals from Paramount Skydance (\"PSKY\"), as well as interest from multiple other parties.\n\nThat thorough process, overseen by the Board with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, as well as our management team, led to the company entering into a merger agreement with Netflix on December 4, with the substantial benefits to WBD shareholders described below. Having failed to submit the best proposal for you, our shareholders, PSKY launched an offer nearly identical to its most recently rejected proposal.\n\nAs a Board, we have now conducted another review and determined that PSKY's tender offer remains inferior to the Netflix merger. The Board continues to unanimously recommend the Netflix merger, and that you reject the PSKY offer and not tender your shares.\n\nBelow, and in more detail in our 14D-9 filing, we highlight the many reasons for the Board's determination. None of these reasons will be a surprise to PSKY given our clear, and oft-repeated, feedback on their six prior proposals.\n\nThe terms of the Netflix merger are superior. The PSKY offer provides inadequate value and imposes numerous, significant risks and costs on WBD.\n\nThe value we have secured for shareholders through the Netflix merger is extraordinary by any measure.\n\nOur agreement with Netflix gives WBD shareholders $23.25 in cash, plus $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock (based on a collar range of $97.91 - $119.67 in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing), plus the additional value of the shares of Discovery Global and the opportunity to participate in future potential upside following Discovery Global's separation from WBD. The entire Board is confident in our recommendation that Netflix represents the best value-creating path for shareholders.\n\nPSKY has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a \"full backstop\" from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has.\n\nPSKY's most recent proposal includes a $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind. Instead, they propose that you rely on an unknown and opaque revocable trust for the certainty of this crucial deal funding. Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was — and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming — the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer.\n\nAnd a revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling stockholder. The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change. As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time. And the documents provided by PSKY for this conditional commitment contain gaps, loopholes and limitations that put you, our shareholders, and our company at risk.\n\nAmplifying the concerns about the credibility of the equity commitment being offered by PSKY, the revocable trust and PSKY have agreed that the trust's liability for damages, even in the case of a willful breach, would be capped at 7% of its commitment ($2.8 billion on a $108.4 billion transaction). Of course, the damage to WBD and its stockholders were the trust or PSKY to breach their obligations to close a transaction would likely be many multiples of this amount.\n\nWBD's merger agreement with Netflix is a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments. The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet. The debt financing for the PSKY bid relies on an unsecure revocable trust commitment as well as the credit worthiness of a $15 billion market cap company with a credit rating at or only a notch above \"junk\" status from the two leading rating agencies. The financial condition and creditworthiness of PSKY, which, if its proposed transaction were to close, would have a high gross leverage ratio of 6.8x 2026E debt to EBITDA with virtually no current free cash flow generation before synergies, raise substantial risks for its acquisition of WBD. Such debt levels reflect a risky capital structure that is vulnerable to even potentially small changes in the PSKY or WBD business between signing and closing.\n\nAdditionally, PSKY contemplates $9 billion in synergies from the mergers of Paramount/Skydance and their offer for WBD. These targets are both ambitious from an operational perspective and would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.\n\nThe Board's review was full, transparent and comprehensive — establishing a level playing field that fostered a rigorous and fair process.\n\nThe Board repeatedly engaged with all parties, including extensive engagement with PSKY and its advisors over the course of nearly three months. We held dozens of calls and meetings with its principals and advisors including four in-person meetings and meals between David Zaslav and David and/or Larry Ellison and provided multiple opportunities for PSKY to offer a proposal that was superior to those of the other bidders, which PSKY never did.\n\nAfter each bid, we informed PSKY of the material deficiencies and offered potential solutions. Despite this feedback, PSKY has never submitted a proposal that is superior to the Netflix merger agreement.\n\nDespite PSKY's media statements to the contrary, the Board does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk between the PSKY offer and the Netflix merger.\n\nThe Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the PSKY offer with its regulatory advisors. The Board believes that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material. The Board also notes that Netflix has agreed to a record-setting regulatory termination cash fee of $5.8 billion, significantly higher than PSKY's $5 billion break fee.\n\nThe offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time prior to its completion; it is not the same thing as a binding merger agreement. The first paragraph of the offer states it is \"subject to the conditions set forth in this offer to purchase (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time)\" and continues on the next page, \"we reserve the right to amend the Offer in any respect (including amending the Offer Price)\". In addition, the offer is not capable of being completed by its current expiration date, due to the need for, among other things, global regulatory approvals, which PSKY indicates may take 12-18 months. Nothing in this structure offers WBD shareholders any deal certainty.\n\nThe PSKY offer provides an untenable degree of risk and potential downside for WBD shareholders.\n\nThere will be additional costs associated with PSKY's offer that could impact shareholders.\n\nWhen considering the PSKY offer at this juncture, it is important to note that its acceptance could incur significant additional costs to shareholders — all of which PSKY has ignored in their communications. WBD would have to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee, which PSKY has not offered to reimburse. In addition, WBD would incur approximately $1.5 billion in financing costs if we do not complete our planned debt exchange as agreed to with certain of our debtholders, which would not be permitted by the PSKY offer. This additional $4.3 billion in potential costs represents approximately $1.66 per share to be borne by WBD shareholders if the offer does not close.\n\nWe look forward to moving ahead with our combination with Netflix and delivering the compelling and certain value it will create for shareholders. We urge you to carefully read the 14D-9 filed with the SEC this morning and available on our website, which more fully details the strategic review process and the Board's reasons for its recommendation to you.\n\nThe Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors",

    "description": "Paramount's David Ellison wants to buy all of Warner, including its cable networks. How much they're worth is a big part of his fight vs. Netflix.",
    "fullText": "The fight between Paramount and Netflix over Warner Bros. Discovery is ultimately about who gets to control HBO and the Warner movie studio.\n\nBut the way that fight gets settled is going to involve an unusual side quest: CNN, TNT, the Food Network, and a bunch of other cable networks WBD wants to get rid of. Specifically: What are all of those shrinking cable networks worth?\n\nWhich leads us to a pretty weird place: Paramount CEO David Ellison, who wants to buy all of WBD — including its cable networks — is arguing that those cable networks aren't worth very much at all. And Netflix, which doesn't want to buy those cable networks, is implicitly arguing that they're worth much more.\n\nThat's because in the Netflix scenario, current WBD shareholders would go through two transactions: First, WBD would spin out its cable networks into a new company, and WBD investors would be given shares in that new company. Then Netflix would buy the remainder of WBD — HBO and the studio — for cash and stock.\n\nWhich means Netflix, and WBD executives who have blessed the Netflix offer, will want investors to think the cable networks are valuable. Ellison wants them to think the opposite.\n\n\"The lower you value the cable assets, the greater advantage Paramount's bid has. If shareholders believe the cable operations are more highly valued, then Netflix's bid, which assumes they will be spun off, means investors get an overall bigger sum of money.\"\n\nAnd here's the actual gap: Ellison says the spin-off is worth about $1 per WBD share — or roughly $2.5 billion, based on WBD's current valuation. Independent analysts think it might be closer to $4 per share — or roughly $10 billion. Paramount and Netflix reps declined to comment; WBD hasn't responded to my request.\n\nSo one side is describing a rounding error, especially when it's part of a deal that could be worth $108 billion. The other is describing, more or less, a midsize media company.\n\nAnd yes, this is equity value, not enterprise value — this already assumes the spin-off gets saddled with billions of WBD's debt under the Netflix plan. But we're going to focus this conversation on the shares that ultimately end up in a WBD investor's brokerage account.\n\nAnd if you believe David Ellison and Co., those investors aren't getting much. Because CNN, Turner, and all of the networks formerly owned by Discovery aren't worth much at all.\n\nAnd yes, the cable network industry is a falling knife, which is why many big media companies that own cable networks are trying to ditch them. But are things really that bad?\n\nMaybe. Maybe, using Ellison's math, all of CNN plus a pile of other cable networks — which still generate cash, mind you — are worth about 16 Bari Weisses, based on the reported $150 million he paid for her Free Press site.\n\nOr maybe all of that is worth $10 billion — which means it's still less than 1% of Google. Which feels like a metaphor for the entire media industry in 2025: Even a roomful of famous brands barely registers in a world run by giant software companies.\n\nSomewhere in that $2.5 billion to $10 billion range is the real answer. But the headline is clear: The networks that once held the entire cable bundle together are now garage sale leftovers. Worth something to someone — but a whole lot less than they used to be.",

    "description": "Former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer predicts \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros. between Netflix and Paramount.",
    "fullText": "A former Disney executive who oversaw its dealmaking expects \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer\" from Netflix, Paramount Skydance, or both, said Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, on Tuesday at the UBS media conference.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion, including debt. Paramount Skydance then launched a hostile offer, saying on Monday that it's willing to pay $108.4 billion for the whole firm, including the TV networks like CNN and HGTV. Executives at Netflix and Paramount CEO David Ellison have each framed their offers as the best for employees, Hollywood, WBD shareholders, and TV viewers. Both suitors also said they're confident they can pass regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMayer, now the co-CEO of Cocomelon owner Candle Media, said he thinks Paramount's hostile bid will reignite the faceoff for Warner Bros. and force the eventual winner to fork over more money.\n\n\"From the Warner Bros. Discovery perspective, this is nothing but good news,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer added: \"Does it move up another $5 billion or $10 billion? I think it probably does. That's what it's going to take to win it.\"\n\nMayer said the battle for Warner Bros. reminds him of the fight for control of 21st Century Fox between Disney and Comcast, which he was involved in during his tenure at the Mouse House.\n\nUnder Mayer, Disney agreed to buy Fox's studio, FX, and its stake in Hulu for $52.4 billion in equity, or $66.1 billion with debt, in December 2017. Six months later, cable giant Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash offer for those same assets. Disney ultimately won, but it was forced to pay a heftier price of $71.3 billion. Mayer helped engineer Disney's initial agreement with Fox, but had moved to a role atop Disney's streaming business by the time the acquisition closed.\n\n\"That was a difficult process,\" Mayer said of Comcast's bid for Fox. \"It added $19 billion to the price tag. Still a good deal, but not the exceptional deal that it was before we had to pay more.\"\n\nWhile Disney's deal with Fox gave it control over Hulu and bolstered its library, Disney activist investor Nelson Peltz argued that the Mouse House had shown \"poor judgment\" by \"overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets.\"\n\nAs Netflix and Paramount vie for Warner Bros., Mayer said the Disney-Comcast showdown \"points to where we might see this going.\"\n\nThat's because Ellison's $30-per-share hostile bid, which Paramount also sent to WBD's board, might not be rich enough, Mayer said.\n\n\"David Ellison has already kind of hinted at that, that he hasn't done his best and final yet, and I suspect he hasn't,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer was likely referencing a text message from Ellison to WBD CEO David Zaslav, which was made public as part of a Paramount filing on Monday: \"Please note importantly we did not include 'best and final' in our bid.\"\n\n\"The team at Paramount is aggressive,\" Mayer said. He pointed to the gargantuan amount of money that David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry, have at their disposal.\n\n\"I don't think there's a whole lot of hesitancy to spend it,\" Mayer said.",

    "description": "The fight between Netflix and Paramount over who will buy Warner Bros. is heating up. Here's what markets are thinking about the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "A bidding war has broken out over one of America's most iconic media companies, and investors in the three firms involved are mixed on the prospect of where it'll all shake out.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery have climbed on the back of a hostile bid from Paramount Skydance to acquire the film and television company, but they're still slightly below the competing bid from Netflix, which was announced as the winner of the sale process last Friday.\n\nParamount on Monday made an all-cash offer worth $30 a share to acquire Warner Bros. and its film studio and streaming services.\n\nIt's unclear which way Warner Bros. will go. The company's board of directors said on Monday that it wasn't changing its recommendation regarding its agreement with Netflix, but would review Paramount's offer over the next two weeks. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nMarkets, though, are flashing some clues about what investors think might happen next. Here's what to watch.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery rose to $27.70 on Tuesday, just below Netflix's offer of $27.75 a share.\n\nIf the stock were to surpass that level, that could be a sign investors expect Warner Bros. to go with Paramount's offer, or that they expect Netflix to put together a better offer, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I would say that there's a combination of both of those things probably in play right now,\" Hogan said of investors pricing in both scenarios, though he noted that trading activity in Warner Bros. Discovery shares may also be reflecting uncertainty among investors as Paramount revealed its hostile bid on Monday.\n\nThere's also the issue of regulatory approval, which could explain the slight discount in Warner Bros. Discovery stock to Netflix's offer price. Comments from Donald Trump on Monday suggested Netflix's ownership of Warner Bros. could draw scrutiny from the administration.\n\nIn a statement after it unveiled its offer, Paramount said its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery would offer shareholders around $18 billion \n\nNetflix stock is down 7% since last Thursday's close, with shares dropping through Friday's session as investors digested the news that the media giant would acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio business.\n\nInvestors rarely reward the acquirer in a large M&A deal like this, and it appears they're also not thrilled about the prospect of a fierce bidding war.\n\nNetflix stock continued to slide through Monday's session on news of Paramount's competing bid, and dipped again on Tuesday. The streaming platform has agreed to pay Warner Bros. $5.8 billion if its deal doesn't go through.\n\nShares of Paramount Skydance, meanwhile, jumped on Monday on enthusiasm for a potential deal, but the stock slipped 3% on Tuesday.\n\nBettors don't see Paramount's hostile bid going through with ease. While Paramount has edged up slightly over Netflix on some open bets on Polymarket, other wagers have its chances of acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery by mid-2026 at less than 50%.\n\nOn Polymarket, bettors see a 43% chance Paramount will be the winning bid, compared to a 39% chance priced in for Netflix.\n\nOn Kalshi, the odds that Paramount will win are about 50-50.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance and Netflix bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, highlighting streaming, Hollywood jobs, and regulatory approval in their rival pitches.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood's latest high-drama battle of the titans: Paramount versus Netflix.\n\nDavid Ellison's Paramount made a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery after WBD rebuffed its multiple offers and accepted Netflix's offer to buy its studio and streaming business.\n\nThis means Ellison, who is backed by his billionaire father, Larry Ellison of Oracle, is making his case directly to shareholders on why he'd be the best owner for WBD.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"\n\nNetflix didn't respond to the hostile bid but has said that by combining its streaming hits with WBD's classic library and prestige HBO fare, it can supercharge its offering.\n\n\"Together, we can give audiences around the world even more value and choice, and get one step closer to being the most loved and the most valued entertainment company,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in announcing the deal Friday.\n\nHere's how the companies made their cases to various stakeholders, which include investors, employees, Hollywood talent, and regulators.\n\nFinancials: Paramount offered $30 per WBD share for all of WBD, compared to Netflix's offer of $27.75 per WBD share for its streaming and studios business, excluding its TV networks, such as CNN and TNT. While Netflix's offer was a mix of cash and stock, Ellison emphasized that Paramount's offer is all cash, and $17.6 billion more than the Netflix deal, an $82.7 billion offer that includes $72 billion in equity.\n\nApproval: Ellison repeatedly argued that he's more likely to win regulatory approval than Netflix is. He said he anticipated approval coming in as little as 12 months. President Donald Trump said he'll be \"involved\" in evaluating the deal. Larry Ellison is a longtime ally of Trump, and the firm of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is part of the Paramount offer.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Ellison argued that the Paramount deal would be good for jobs and consumers. He said Paramount is committed to growing the film and TV output of both businesses, including a theatrical slate of 30-plus releases a year. It's a pointed contrast with Netflix, whose preference for getting movies onto its streaming service quickly has created friction with the film industry. (Netflix has said it would continue to release Warner Bros. movies in theaters.) Ellison said adding WBD would make Paramount a robust competitor to Netflix, while Netflix buying WBD would extend its dominance in streaming and give it more power to raise prices to consumers.\n\nFinancials: Netflix said the deal would give it a number of financial benefits. While Netflix is the top subscription streaming service, it has a ways to go in creating culture-defining IP. A big part of Netflix's pitch is that it'll be able to build on WBD's famous franchises like DC Comics and Harry Potter, fueling a flywheel that'll expand its business. WBD would have to pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it accepts a different offer, which Netflix said limited its risk. On the other hand, Netflix would have to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee if the deal were blocked by regulators.\n\nApproval: Wall Street analysts have generally characterized Netflix as having a tougher approval path. However, the company has been making the pitch to Trump and his administration. Trump said Sunday that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos visited him last week. Trump said Sarandos was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" However, Trump added that Netflix has \"a very big market share,\" which \"could be a problem.\" Netflix expressed confidence in the approval process, saying it expects the deal to close in 12 to 18 months, after WBD completes its spinoff of linear channels into a new company, Discovery Global.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Netflix said the deal would provide better choice and value for consumers by bringing together the Warner Bros. film and TV show libraries with its own offerings, and help the WBD's creators reach a bigger audience. Netflix said many of its subscribers don't \n\nWith Hollywood employment stagnating, Netflix also argued that the addition of Warner Bros. would let it expand its production and increase jobs over the long term. It expects to achieve $2 billion to $3 billion in cost savings from the deal, primarily coming from eliminating overlapping support staff. Sarandos contrasted this with a Paramount outcome.\n\n\"In the offer Paramount is talking about today, they're talking about $6 billion of synergies,\" he said at a UBS conference on Monday. \"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs. We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"",

    "description": "David Ellison is officially chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance after an $8 billion tie-up. Next on his wish list: Warner Bros Discovery.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison is officially the CEO of Paramount Skydance. After a successful Paramount merger, next on his wish list is Warner Bros. Discovery — and he's launched a hostile takeover bid in an effort to scoop it out from Netflix's hands.\n\nThe 42-year-old founded Skydance back in 2006 with some help from his father Larry Ellison, the Oracle cofounder who's worth $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nSince then, Skydance has enjoyed considerable success with films including \"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\" and \"Baywatch,\" and a total box office haul of more than $8 billion. The merger deal valued Skydance at $4.75 billion.\n\nIts biggest hit has been \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which became the second-highest-grossing film of 2022 after making almost $1.5 billion worldwide.\n\nAfter seeing the original \"Top Gun\" as a child, David Ellison became obsessed with flying. His billionaire father bought him a plane at the age of 13 and they took flying lessons together. By 17, Ellison had begun competing in air shows performing aerial acrobatics.\n\nHe gave up flying competitively after starting a film degree at USC that he later dropped out of, Ellison told Kara Swisher in an episode of The New York Times' \"Sway\" podcast.\n\nBefore becoming an entertainment executive, though, Ellison had a brief foray as an actor.\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in a Skydance film called \"Flyboys,\" about American pilots who flew for the French Air Force in World War I.\n\nThe movie cost about $65 million, but flopped after taking just $18 million or so, per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSince moving behind the camera, Ellison's company has had a relationship with Paramount that dates back to 2011 when Skydance co-financed Joel and Ethan Coen's \"True Grit\" with the studio.\n\nThe film was both a critical and commercial success, winning 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and taking about $200 million at the box office.\n\nEllison's sister, Megan, is also in the movie game. Her production company Annapurna Pictures was behind releases including \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" \"Her,\" \"American Hustle,\" and \"Phantom Thread,\" all of which received Oscar nominations.\n\nThe $8 billion tie-up of Skydance and Paramount officially closed in August. Ellison named himself chairman and CEO of the newly combined company, Paramount Skydance.\n\nSoon after taking the helm, Ellison led Paramount Skydance through layoffs, which can be common in the wake of a merger. The company laid off 1,000 employees in October and said that more cuts were coming. Six hundred employees took severance packages and quit instead of returning to the office, it said.\n\nEllison has also installed Bari Weiss at the top of CBS News. Weiss left The New York Times Opinion section in 2020 and later built the The Free Press, which Paramount Skydance acquired for about $150 million.\n\nEllison continued his spending run. He brought in Netflix veteran Cindy Holland and shelled out $7.7 billion for UFC rights.\n\n\"Everywhere you look, he's throwing money,\" LightShed Partners media analyst Rich Greenfield told Business Insider. \"That's what Hollywood gets excited about.\"\n\nNow, Ellison has his eye on another acquisition: Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nParamount Skydance had earlier entered a competitive bid against Netflix and Comcast to acquire the company.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery ultimately accepted Netflix's bid to purchase the company's streaming and studio business for $72 billion.\n\nEllison is now fighting to stop that from happening. On December 8, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile bid for WBD, offering to pay shareholders $30 per share for the entire company.\n\nThat morning, Ellison made his case to shareholders and WBD's board on CNBC.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"",

    "description": "Paramount's Larry and David Ellison are making a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Three of their partners are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.",
    "fullText": "The governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi want to invest billions of dollars into a would-be mega media conglomerate made up of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWhat would they get for their money?\n\nSpoiler: I don't know. And Paramount, the company that wants to use the three oil nations to help finance its bid for WBD, won't say.\n\nBut it sure seems like a question worth asking, as Paramount launches a hostile bid for WBD after losing last week's auction to Netflix.\n\nParamount says the three petrostates will be part of the new bid — as they were in Paramount's previous offers for WBD (something Paramount had at one point denied).\n\nAs of a week ago, those three countries were going to kick in $24 billion — double the $11.8 billion the Ellison family planned to invest in WBD.\n\nNow, Paramount won't say how much the three countries' sovereign wealth funds plan to invest in their newest proposal. It says Larry and David Ellison, who currently own Paramount, along with RedBird Capital, the private equity group, will \"backstop\" the deal — meaning they promise to finance all of it if necessary.\n\nBut Paramount still anticipates those three countries will ultimately invest in a combined Paramount/WBD, along with Jared Kushner — Donald Trump's son-in-law, whose Affinity Partners group invests money on behalf of … Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, among others.\n\nThe difference this time around, Paramount says, is that those countries' sovereign wealth funds won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would operate. They wouldn't get board seats, voting rights, or any other governance over the company. Paramount declined to comment.\n\nThe reason Paramount needs to stress that, apparently, is that Warner Bros. Discovery had previously flagged that as an issue. Now that the oil states won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would be run, Paramount says the deal wouldn't need approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a regulatory body that's supposed to sign off on foreign investments in some US companies.\n\nThat's all part of Paramount's pitch it is making to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders: A deal for Paramount to buy WBD will pass regulators much more easily than Netflix buying WBD.\n\nBut who knows how that will actually pan out? Up until last week, the conventional wisdom was that Paramount would be the most likely winner for WBD, in no small part because Larry Ellison was a longtime Donald Trump backer, and his son, David, had been trying to curry favor with Trump as well.\n\nNow it turns out that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was also wooing Trump. He visited Trump at the White House, and Trump seems to have been taken with him: \"He was in the Oval Office last week. I have a lot of respect for him. He is a great person,\" Trump told reporters Sunday night. \"Ted has really done a legendary job.\"\n\nSo in a world where Donald Trump is the most important decision-maker when it comes to what American companies are allowed to do, I don't know if the niceties of CFIUS rules will be the ultimate arbiter. (Here I'll note that last year the US passed a law that required China's ByteDance to divest itself of its ownership in the US. TikTok business or shut down. That hasn't happened, and TikTok is still alive and well in the U.S.)\n\nI also don't know if Trump will particularly care that three Middle Eastern oil states could conceivably own a big chunk of a conglomerate that includes CNN, CBS, HBO, and two movie studios. He has been quite eager to do deals in the Middle East, and last month he rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi crown prince at the White House.\n\nAnd perhaps that eagerness explains why Paramount didn't think it was a big deal to include petrostate investments in the past — and why it still thinks it's OK to have them now.\n\nBut again: If Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi are looking to put anything close to $24 billion into an enormously powerful media conglomerate — one with huge reach in both the US and ambitions for the rest of the world — will they be satisfied with purely financial returns? Or do they expect something else for their money?\n\nI'd love to know. Maybe you would, too.",

    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison has now made his pitch to buy Warner Bros. Discovery to that company's board and shareholders, as well as his own employees.\n\nEllison pitched Paramount employees about his renewed offer to buy WBD in an email sent just after 3 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison wrote in the memo to staffers, which was first obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe Paramount CEO said he believes his all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD is superior to Netflix's $27.75 offer for WBD's streaming and studio assets, including the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, and streamer HBO Max.\n\nParamount made a so-called hostile bid for WBD on Monday morning, hoping to get investors on its side.\n\nEllison is also trying to get his employees on board. He's selling them on a vision where a Paramount-WBD tie-up becomes a powerhouse capable of challenging Netflix and YouTube.\n\n\"Our motivation for pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery has been consistent from the start,\" Ellison wrote in the memo. \"We love this industry and believe deeply in its future.\"\n\nEllison also said that \"storytelling\" is \"one of America's greatest cultural and economic exports.\"\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos similarly made an America-focused pitch when he approached President Donald Trump about the deal, he said at an industry conference on Monday afternoon.\n\n\"What the president has been interested in, in this deal, has been: To what extent does it protect and create jobs in America?\" Sarandos said.\n\nNetflix has said its proposal would be best for consumers and the entertainment industry. Paramount has made the opposite argument.\n\nRead Ellison's full memo to Paramount employees below:",

    "description": "In seeking to buy Warner Brothers for $108 billion, Paramount is making one of the top ten largest hostile takeover bids in history.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance's bid to purchase Warner Bros. Discovery is a big deal — literally.\n\nThe all-cash offer of $30 per share works out to a valuation of more than $108 billion, or an equity valuation of $78.7 billion, for WBD's entire operation, putting it in the upper echelons of hostile takeover attempts in recent decades.\n\nIn fairness, the $82.7 billion deal, or $72 billion equity valuation, from streaming giant Netflix is also pretty massive. That was the one WBD's board had agreed on, and it excluded certain pieces of the business.\n\n\"We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.\" Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement.\n\nTo get a sense of the biggest hostile takeover deals of the past 30 years, Business Insider asked financial analytics provider Dealogic to pull the numbers.\n\nHere are the equity valuations of the 14 largest hostile takeover announcements since 1995, and where the Paramount deal for WBD would fit in.\n\nComcast launched an unsolicited bid for AT&T Broadband, which was then the largest cable operator in the US. After a few rounds of negotiations and pressure from shareholders, AT&T accepted the offer. The deal gave rise to Comcast's national expansion.\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Tesla made an unsolicited offer to buy Twitter after building a large stake. Twitter initially resisted, but eventually accepted the deal. Musk, however, tried to back out of the deal and was met with litigation, before eventually closing the takeover he started. Musk had since then changed the platform's algorithm, its name, and content moderation rules.\n\nIn what was at the time Europe's largest hostile takeover, RBS and Bank of Scotland fought in a bidding war for NatWest, which ended with RBS's victory through a hostile offer. The deal helped RBS become a global banking giant, but at the cost of taking on excessive debt. RBS collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nRoche, which already owned a majority stake in Genentech, launched a hostile bid for full ownership. The biotech company initially resisted the attempt due to undervaluation. After raising the offer, Roche succeeded.\n\nBAT made an unsolicited offer to buy the remainder of Reynolds, after already owning a large stake in it. Reynolds negotiated a higher price but ultimately accepted the takeover. The deal created the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company at the time.\n\nBelgium's InBev made a hostile offer for Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of beer brand Budweiser. AB's management and founding family initially resisted being taken over by a foreign company, but shareholders pressured them to accept after InBev raised its bid.\n\nBayer made an unsolicited offer to Monsanto, and the chemical company held out for a higher price before accepting the deal. Unfortunately for Bayer, the German biotech company also inherited lawsuits against Monsanto's Roundup herbicide.\n\nTotalFina launched a hostile bid for Elf in a dramatic French corporate battle. After nearly a year of fighting and regulatory scrutiny, the companies merged and became one of the world's biggest oil companies. The combined entity was eventually renamed as TotalEnergies.\n\nJapanese company Takeda made a series of unsolicited bids for UK-based Shire. Shire repeatedly rejected the deal until Takeda substantially increased the offer. This is one of the largest acquisitions ever made by a Japanese company, and it gave Takeda a large rare disease drug portfolio.\n\nSanofi's unsolicited takeover was met with strong resistance from Aventis, so much so that the company sought to be acquired by a different pharmaceutical giant, Novartis. Sanofi sweetened the offer, and Aventis eventually accepted it.\n\nParamount launched its hostile takeover bid after WBD's board bypassed its offers in favor of a deal with Netflix.\n\nPfizer launched a hostile bid to break apart Warner-Lambert's agreed merger with American Home Products. Warner-Lambert fought back but ultimately conceded. This gave Pfizer full ownership of Lipitor, which holds the record for the highest lifetime sales for a single drug.\n\nImmediately before the 2008 financial crisis, Barclays tried to acquire ABN AMRO amicably, but RBS, alongside Fortis and Banco Santander, countered with a hostile, higher bid and won. The acquisition sped up RBS's collapse soon after.\n\nIn a move that consolidated much of the world's beer industry under one entity, AB InBev launched a hostile offer for SABMiller, eventually raising the bid to satisfy resistant shareholders.\n\nUK company Vodafone AirTouch launched a hostile bid for German company Mannesmann, which had rapidly become one of Europe's most valuable telecom companies. Mannesmann fiercely resisted, framing the bid as an attack on German industrial values and national pride. The record-setting battle lasted three months, ending with Vodafone winning by raising the bid.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he wanted to \"do what's right\" in the media war brewing between Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix said that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion. WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.\n\nIn response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well. I know what they're doing, but I have to see, I have to see what percentage of market they have.\"\n\n\"We have to see the Netflix percentage of market, Paramount, the percentage of market,\" he said during a roundtable at the White House. \"I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to do what's right. It's so, so very important to do what's right,\" he added.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he would be involved in the sale of WBD, and that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"\n\nBut he also said that Netflix's CEO, Ted Sarandos, was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"\n\nTrump's involvement in the media war is significant because he has the authority to stop a deal from taking place. In 2017, he voiced his opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.\n\nBusiness Insider's media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, wrote in a column last week that a deal to buy WBD would need regulatory approval, which in 2025 is synonymous with Trump's approval.\n\nParamount is putting up a strong fight for Warner Bros. Its CEO, David Ellison, pitched the WBD offer to his employees in a Monday memo seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison's memo wrote.",
