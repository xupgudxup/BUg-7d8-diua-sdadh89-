    "fullText": "On Saturday night, the MMA world leader returned to Paramount+ with a new UFC Fight Night card in Houston, TX. On the event’s main card, top 15 heavyweights Serghei Spivac and Ante Delija went toe-to-toe, looking to move up in the UFC heavyweight rankings.\n\nSpivac ended up getting the decision win after a violent and back-and-forth war. Let’s look at how his victory changed our latest UFC heavyweight rankings.\n\nSerghei Spivac has remained a consistent top-15-level fighter at heavyweight for the last five years. While he has lost six times inside the Octagon, his most recent setbacks have come to elite competition like Tom Aspinall, Waldo Cortes-Acosta, and Ciryl Gane. However, he also has quite a few big wins against big-name or ranked foes.\n\nHe scored another in February when he earned a very hard-fought win over talented finisher Ante Delija. His latest win stopped a potential losing skid and got him back in our top 10.\n\nFormer Brave CF star Shamil Gaziev has put together a notable run in the division. Although a doctor stoppage in 2024 gave him his first loss, the Dagestani big man is 3-1 in the Octagon, including two nasty knockouts. Gaziev is a rising heavyweight fighter to keep an eye on. However, he took a big risk in November when he okay’d a short-notice fight with Waldo Cortes Acosta. The decision backfired, and he suffered a stinging knockout loss.\n\nPFL and Contender Series veteran Rizvan Kuniev lands in our UFC heavyweight rankings after he scored the biggest win of his career with a hard-fought victory over Jailton Almeida in February. While it wasn’t pretty, he proved he can compete with top-10 talent. He will need a definitive W in his next fight if he wants to hold on to a spot in our latest rankings.\n\nMarcin Tubura has quietly been a mainstay of the UFC heavyweight rankings over the last half-decade. While he owns a 14-8 record in the company, he has grown immensely as a fighter in the last few years. He is 10-3 in his last 12, with his only losses coming to elite talents Alexander Volkov, Serghei Spivac, and current interim heavyweight king Tom Aspinall.\n\nIn March, he picked up a hard-fought win over Aspinall’s trainer partner and one of the better rising prospects in the division, Mick Parkin.\n\nSergei Pavlovich has been an absolute crushing machine during much of his UFC career. After a loss to Alistair Overeem in his debut, he reeled off six straight wins, and all of those victories came by way of a devastating knockout. However, a two-fight losing streak stopped all of his momentum. But he has righted the ship in 2025 and scored a pair of decision wins. The most recent was against Waldo Cortes-Acosta in Shanghai.\n\nDominican big man Waldo Cortes Acosta has quietly become a serious force in the heavyweight division. In his 12 bouts inside the Octagon, he has posted 10 wins, including against some notable talents in the top 15. The latest came in January at UFC 324 against fan-favorite Derrick Lewis.\n\n“Salsa Boy” showed why he is one of the more athletic and polished strikers in the division when he added a two-time challenger to his hit list inside the Octagon.\n\nWhile there have been some very tough losses in the career of Curtis Blaydes, he has remained a top-five level heavyweight for much of the last decade. At UFC 299, he had an opportunity to finally right his big-fight wrongs and did so in a major way when he handed Jailton Almeida his first loss in the Octagon.\n\nThe win moved “Razor” into a UFC 304 title fight against Tom Aspinall. Unfortunately, his big fight curse returned, and after a strong start suffered a TKO loss in Round 1. At UFC Baku, the talented wrestler returned and was able to grind out a hard-fought win over Rizvan Kuniev. But the victory did little to get him back into title contention.\n\nAlexander Volkov has been a top-level MMA heavyweight for a long time. While he has been unable to earn a UFC title shot, he has remained a stalwart of the top 10 for years. To many who watched UFC 310, he scored a victory against Ciryl Gane that should have earned him a title. However, the judges did not score it his way, and he suffered a crushing defeat to the Frenchman.\n\nIn October, he bounced back from the setback to get himself right back into title contention by scoring a very hard-fought split-decision win over top-five talent Jailton Almeida.\n\nCiryl Gane is a fantastic athlete and the most technical heavyweight striker in the sport. It is why he is consistently in the title discussion. However, his wrestling deficiencies continue to be a problem, and they showed up again in his UFC 310 clash with Alexander Volkov. Fortunately for “Bon Gamin,” he was able to escape with a decision win.\n\nThe victory earned him a title opportunity at UFC 321. However, the good luck he had against Volkov turned to bad, and his chance at winning UFC gold again was stopped after just a few minutes when he poked champ Tom Aspinall in both eyes and caused a fight-ending no-contest.\n\nEnglishman Tom Aspinall is the best heavyweight in the UFC. That became official when MMA GOAT Jon Jones decided to walk away from the sport earlier this year. The Englishman has beaten many of the best fighters in the division for the last three years and is the undisputed top big man in the eyes of most UFC fans.\n\nAfter definitively avenging the lone loss of his UFC career in the summer of 2024, he made his first defense of the undisputed title in October. Unfortunately, a nasty eye poke from opponent Ciryl Game ended the UFC 321 main event after just a few minutes. An immediate rematch early in 2026 seems likely.\n\nNew UFC Middleweight Rankings: Is Strickland vs. Chimaev Next After UFC Houston?\n\nComplete UFC Fight Night Results & Highlights: Sean Strickland Dominates In Bounce Back Win\n\nRonda Rousey Explains Why TKO Being Cheap Killed Plans For Return Fight in UFC",

    "fullText": "Sean Strickland has established himself as a man who demands media attention each time he speaks, though often not for the right reasons.\n\nThe UFC's move to Paramount has added benefits for fighters and fans alike, with a value boost in athlete bonuses for good performances, while supporters can tune in for $8.99 per month, a portion of the previous cost. But less than two months into their deal, Paramount is facing backlash after Strickland presented one of his infamous tirades during fight week.\n\nThe former UFC middleweight champion is in contention to compete for another title should he win his next outing, but that hasn't stopped him from being his old self. Strickland only had the center stage for a couple of minutes before discrediting Paramount.\n\n\"Yeah, no, f*** Paramount, man,\" Strickland said in protest against the new home of the UFC. \"It's real quiet today. I like it, man. You've got to like lose fights more often. It's going back to the Apex here with you guys. It's real quiet. No one's here. Is that like a bad sign for the MMA world or is it just this card?\"\n\nContinuing his attack on Paramount, Strickland blamed them for ruining a childhood passion of his.\n\n\"Paramount's cool,\" Strickland continued. \"I mean, they f***ing ruined Halo, but other than that, you know. They made it gay. Other than f***ing ruining like a childhood memory and legend to me, I mean, Paramount's cool.\"\n\n\"We don't make more money, but you know.\"\n\nAs the mixed martial arts world has become accustomed to, Sean Strickland is never too far away from damaging his image with wild remarks.\n\nHis appearance at UFC Houston media day had several controversial moments, but arguably none worse than the comments about Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, who was honored with the Super Bowl LX halftime show headlining spot.\n\n\"I mean, look at the NFL, dude,\" Strickland said. \"You had that, I don't even want to say the fa**ots name because it's just like, what?... The Puerto Rican, right? Yeah, that f***ing fa**ot.\"\n\n\"Like, dude, it is so crazy that this is America now. Like, back in the day, dude, the NFL was like, the NFL was the f***ing standard of being a f***ing man. And now every f***ing year, the NFL, I think they all get together around a table and say, 'You know what, guys? How do we f***ing ruin this sport? How do we gay it up? How do we f***ing ruin it?' Well, I'll tell you what. Why don't we bring a gay foreigner who doesn't speak f***ing English and have him perform it?\"\n\n\"Like, get the f***. And then you have like, yeah, dude. It's like, the NFL is f***ing pathetic these days. So, even like the NFL players probably f***ing hate it. No, NFL's gay. I think we'd all agree that the NFL got real gay lately...\"\n\nThe aftermath of Sean Strickland's words has not been pretty. Not only have fans demanded that the UFC remove Strickland from any media obligations, while others are calling for his contract to be terminated, but the Paramount network has also been pushed to answer some uncomfortable questions.\n\nAccording to reports, many fans and media outlets have begun pressuring Paramount to respond to Strickland's vulgar comments. Homophobia and sexism persist anytime the UFC fighter is placed in front of a camera.\n\nThe public outrage may be justified, but Dana White will always promote free speech among those working in any of his business ventures. White's willingness to accept any comment is considered positive by some, but concerns are beginning to plague him and Paramount for allowing sensitive topics to be ridiculed.\n\n🚨 Paramount are now facing pressure from the media to address Sean Strickland publicly calling Bad Bunny a “f****t” and making sexist comments\n\nStrickland’s comments are now receiving coverage from @Variety who have contacted Paramount reps for comment, to no response yet pic.twitter.com/QMjLl0eXvY\n\n— ACD MMA (@acdmma_) February 19, 2026",

    "description": "Netflix sent TikTok parent ByteDance a cease-and-desist letter to over its AI video tool Seedance, following in Disney and Paramount's footsteps.",
    "fullText": "Netflix isn't amused by ByteDance's new AI video tool.\n\nThe streaming giant sent a cease-and-desist letter to the China-based TikTok parent on Tuesday night, calling its new generative AI model Seedance 2.0 \"a high-speed piracy engine.\"\n\nSeedance turned heads last week after a user created a viral video of people resembling Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting on a rooftop about disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhile some were impressed, others panicked, with Deadpool cowriter Rhett Reese writing: \"I hate to say it. It's likely over for us.\"\n\nNetflix said in its letter to ByteDance that the company's AI video tool had also made videos mimicking characters from mega-hit Netflix shows like \"Stranger Things,\" \"Bridgerton,\" and \"Squid Game\" as well as the uber-popular movie \"KPop Demon Hunters.\"\n\n\"The use of copyrighted works to create a competing commercial product, especially one that regurgitates the original, is not protected by fair use,\" Netflix's litigation director wrote.\n\nNetflix urged ByteDance to stop generating AI videos that resemble its IP, and to identify and remove all such videos that have already been created. It also insisted that its IP be taken out of Seedance's training datasets.\n\nA ByteDance spokesperson said the company \"respects intellectual property rights\" and has \"heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0.\"\n\n\"We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,\" the ByteDance spokesperson said.\n\nDisney sent ByteDance a message similar to Netflix's last week. That's notable because Disney reached a deal in December to license iconic characters to OpenAI for its video-generating app Sora.\n\nSeedance is using \"a pirated library of Disney's copyrighted characters from Star Wars, Marvel, and other Disney franchises, as if Disney's coveted intellectual property were free public domain clip art,\" Disney said in its cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance.\n\nNetflix echoed that sentiment, saying it would \"not stand by and watch ByteDance treat our valued IP as free, public domain clip art.\"\n\nParamount Skydance also sent a cease-and-desist letter last week to ByteDance expressing similar concerns, Variety reported.\n\nRead Netflix's letter to ByteDance below:",

    "title": "Too old or too good to ignore: The Mohammed Shami conundrum",
    "description": "Mohammed Shami's consistent domestic form and World Cup pedigree raise questions about his continued omission from the Indian team. Despite his impressive wicket-taking record, selectors appear hesitant, possibly due to age and injury concerns, while his coach insists performance and fire are paramount. His return remains a strong possibility.",
    "fullText": "These questions swirl every time Shami’s name is omitted from the Indian team. Everyone knows about him: the rasping seam, the wobble that refuses to settle and the habit of arriving at big tournaments and leaving with bigger hauls. Yet, for all that familiarity, his absence from the Indian team has now become a recurring theme.\n\nIndia are understandably wary of pinning their World Cup hopes on two high-class but injury-prone fast bowlers in their thirties: Shami and Jasprit Bumrah. With the domestic pace cupboard thin, the instinct is to invest early in younger bodies. What is harder to justify is ignoring pedigree. \n\nShami is India’s highest wicket-taker in ODI World Cups: 55 wickets at an average of 13.5 in 18 games. The recent numbers only strengthen his case. In four Ranji Trophy matches for Bengal, Shami bowled an average of 20 overs an innings and claimed 20 scalps at 18.6. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he picked up 16 wickets in seven games. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he prised out 11 at 22.5 in five games. \n\nShami played a crucial role in India’s 2025 Champions Trophy, claiming 9 scalps from 5 games. Yet, he was omitted from 2025-26 central contracts.\n\nBadruddin Siddiqui, Shami’s long-time coach, does not mask his frustration. “There’s fire in him,” he says. “He is serious about playing for India. I always tell him --- perform karte raho: India will need you,” he says. For Siddiqui, the equation is simple. A cricketer’s job is to perform; the selectors’ job is to decide. “Age should never be a consideration. Fitness, performance and fire: that’s what matters.” \n\nDomestic cricket, Siddiqui argues, is too easily dismissed. “Bowling 25 overs in a day is not easy,” he says. “There is no bowler who can replace him. There is a lot left in him.” \n\nFormer Delhi pacer Sanjeev Sharma offers a more nuanced perspective. “There’s a lot of difference between domestic and international cricket,” he says. “Even a T20 international takes a lot out of you: in terms of fielding, bending and chasing. There is no place to hide in international cricket.” \n\n“Perhaps, Shami is not yet at the exact match-fitness level the selectors want him to be,” Sharma notes. \n\nPerhaps, communication has faltered, he says. But Sharma is unequivocal about Shami’s ability. \n\n“Skill-wise, he is your second-best fast bowler after Bumrah. There’s no doubt in my mind that Shami will return.” Around Shami, competition has intensified—Arshdeep Singh’s left-arm angles, Siraj’s stamina, Harshit Rana’s development. But competition does not erase class. “Performs speaks for itself,” Siddiqui says. “Bilkul wapas aayega: he will be back,” he adds.",

    "description": "Netflix, Disney, and Paramount are turning to short-form video as YouTube and TikTok take viewership time. But these quick clips aren't a cure-all.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood giants are betting that snack-sized vertical videos can lure back audiences entranced by TikTok clips and YouTube Shorts.\n\nThe world has become hooked on short-form video. Reels on Instagram and Facebook are generating revenue at an annual rate of $50 billion, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in October, while Google reiterated last week that YouTube Shorts are viewed over 200 billion times per day.\n\nShort-form vertical videos are perfectly designed for phones, which most people carry 24/7, and for our increasingly short attention spans. As the streaming wars evolve, paid services see the phone as the next battleground they have to win.\n\n\"When it comes to engagement, sheer hours are no longer enough — you need frequency,\" Hernan Lopez, the founder of media research firm Owl & Co, told Business Insider. \"To get frequency, you need mobile, and to win in mobile, you need vertical.\"\n\nStreaming executives have taken note. Paramount has made short-form video a product priority and wants to add a million short-form clips to Paramount+ \"as quickly as possible,\" according to one exec, as Business Insider previously reported. Netflix and Peacock have also invested in short-form clips, while Disney has added vertical video to its revamped ESPN app and said it plans to do the same for Disney+.\n\n\"Short-form content is harder to monetize, especially from an advertiser perspective, but easier for young consumers to swallow,\" said Brandon Katz, the insights director at entertainment data firm Greenlight Analytics. \"Not even attempting to engage with it isn't an option.\"\n\nSpokespeople for Disney, Netflix, and NBCUniversal referred Business Insider to previous announcements and comments by executives about their short-form video initiatives. A Paramount spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nStreamers are scrambling for ways to narrow the gap with YouTube, whose viewership share on US TVs has more than doubled since May 2021, according to Nielsen. Higher engagement boosts advertising revenue and can help prevent cancellations.\n\nMedia analysts say vertical video can help streamers build habits and keep users engaged throughout the day, instead of just when they're lounging on their couches at night.\n\nEmily Horgan, a media consultant focused on kids shows, said that \"premium streaming is plowing into this space because of a need to own more lean-back moments in a viewer's day.\"\n\nStreaming executives are also looking for cheap content that can eat up viewing hours in a world where premium scripted shows are more expensive to produce. Video podcasts are one growth area that streamers like Netflix are gravitating toward, and short-form video is another.\n\n\"User-generated content and short-form programming is more cost-effective than trying to hit on the next 'Stranger Things' and 'Mandalorian,'\" Katz said.\n\nStreamers can also use their premium shows and movies to create short-form video. Paramount plans to dabble in short-form video by first repurposing existing content on its platform, according to internal documents viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHowever, those internal documents also revealed that Paramount is brainstorming ways to potentially add user-generated content, which is the backbone of Instagram and TikTok.\n\nShort-form efforts among streamers have ramped up recently, but there have been false starts.\n\nNetflix was the first major streamer to try short-form when it debuted a \"Fast Laughs\" feature in 2021 that brought brief vertical clips of comedies and shows to its mobile app, and later to the TV. However, the feed never took off and was retired two years after its launch.\n\nAlthough Netflix's first foray into short-form video didn't charm audiences, it's not giving up yet. The streaming giant has been testing a vertical video feature since May to see what content and layout audiences prefer, a Netflix spokesperson said.\n\nDisney is trying to boost streaming engagement by bringing vertical video to Disney+ this year, including \"a curated slate\" of AI-generated videos made by OpenAI's Sora, executives said on an earnings call in early February.\n\nAnd Peacock has added short vertical videos from shows and the NBA games it broadcasts, a feature it first unveiled in early 2025.\n\nOne problem: It isn't yet clear that people want to binge short-form video on premium streamers instead of TikTok.\n\n\"Part of what makes YouTube and TikTok special with this format is the interactivity with comments, and the fact that the content is made by actual people,\" said Kasey Moore, who runs the What's on Netflix fan site that tracks Netflix releases.\n\nStill, there could be some value in short form.\n\n\"The goal wouldn't be to suck up time quite like TikTok to then serve ads in between,\" Moore said of Netflix. \"But rather, to leverage that specific format of video to provide tasters in the hopes of getting people to give engagement to the actual shows and movies that they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.\"",

    "fullText": "A veteran Paramount executive is leaving as David Ellison's company shakes up its ad sales leadership.\n\nChris Simon, a Paramount EVP of agency partnerships, is stepping down, three Paramount employees told Business Insider.\n\nSimon spent 31 years at the company, getting his start at CBS in the mid-'90s, and previously worked at USA Networks, according to his LinkedIn.\n\nTwo Paramount staffers said the news was shared during a mid-afternoon meeting on Wednesday, led by Jay Askinasi, Paramount's chief revenue officer, who joined the company in November.\n\nKaren Phillips, a 29-year company veteran whose title is also EVP of agency partnerships for Paramount Advertising, will oversee that team after Simon's departure, Askinasi told employees.\n\nAn experienced Paramount staffer briefed on the change described it as \"more strategic than financial,\" saying that consolidating Simon's position into Phillips' was done to \"remove duplication.\"\n\nA second employee characterized the move as being done to \"streamline processes\" and make \"Paramount easier to work with.\"\n\nA third Paramount insider familiar with the company's thinking said there were a few \"targeted changes\" on the personnel front in Paramount Advertising, \"focused on reducing complexity.\"\n\nSimon is \"stepping down,\" this person said, but would remain with the company for an unspecified period to ease the transition.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nSince taking the helm at Paramount in August, Ellison has made his mark on the company with moves like landing live UFC rights in the US, which is already showing signs of paying off, and by bringing in Bari Weiss as the editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\nEllison also made a bold play to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, though WBD chose Netflix as its preferred acquirer — a decision Paramount is challenging with shareholders and in the courtroom.\n\nUnder Ellison, Paramount has also called most employees back to the office five days a week, made changes to its data and insights team, and looked to jazz up Paramount+ by exploring the addition of short-form video and interactive features.\n\nPersonnel shake-ups are common at companies with new leadership. Another change saw Paramount's head of streaming product and tech, Vibol Hou, leave the company at the end of January, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave a tip or Paramount-related story idea?

Apparently there’s some sort of hatred for Micallef that carried over into the cage and fueled Elliott to jump out to a strong lead. Micallef just wasn’t able to get going on the feet and resembled little of what he looked like in his UFC debut nearly one year ago.\n\nThings kept going wrong for Micallef in the second round as Elliott’s hands starting landing more often. Elliott eventually hurt Micallef on the feet and could have gone for a knockout finish. Instead, he decided to stay in the clinch along the cage, which allowed Micallef the chance to reverse and score a nice takedown. From there, Micallef quickly locked up a tight rear-naked choke and eventually put Elliott to sleep.\n\nCheck out the video highlights below:\n\nJUST LIKE THAT 💥\n\nJonathan Micallef gets the submission victory in round two! #UFC325\n\n[ LIVE on @ParamountPlus ] pic.twitter.com/m9QX7dEu2I\n\nFor complete UFC 325 results, coverage, and highlights click HERE.",

    "fullText": "Paramount CEO David Ellison and his team are getting creative in their quest to turn Paramount+ into a top-tier streaming service.\n\nParamount executives are brainstorming several ways to make their namesake streamer more competitive, including a short-form video feed, a sports multiview feature, and free content, according to an internal presentation viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe presentation was sent by Dan Reich, the Paramount+ head of global product and design, to Dane Glasgow, Paramount's chief product officer, via email in mid-January. It was described as \"a high-level summary of our priorities\" for the first quarter. Reich told Glasgow that it was \"not an exhaustive list\" of Paramount streaming's priorities.\n\nThere are several notable takeaways from the presentation, including that Paramount's priorities include:\n\nThe presentation also indicated that Paramount is brainstorming several new features for the Paramount+ mobile app, including:\n\nThe notion of free content on Paramount+, a paid streamer, is notable since the company already has Pluto TV, a free, ad-supported streaming service.\n\nA person familiar with Paramount's thinking previously told Business Insider that the streaming team regularly tests products and initiatives, and that leadership shapes its priorities based on how those tests go.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe presentation also mentions \"convergence,\" which refers to Paramount's previously announced effort to consolidate its streamers — subscription services Paramount+ and BET+, and free Pluto TV — onto a single tech platform for improved performance and efficiency.\n\n\"Paramount+ stuff goes back to CBS All Access,\" a high-ranking software engineer familiar with the convergence effort told Business Insider, referencing Paramount+'s previous name. \"It goes back to the early, early days of streaming, and it's great that we're finally getting away from all of that.\"\n\nParamount+ has become profitable, though it's still much smaller than its top rivals.\n\nAt last public count, Paramount's flagship streamer had just over 79 million global subscribers, compared to 325 million for Netflix, about 196 million for Disney across Disney+ and Hulu, and 128 million for Warner Bros. Discovery across HBO Max and Discovery+.\n\nParamount+ is far bigger than Peacock, which has 44 million subscribers, though Comcast's streamer only operates in the US.\n\nParamount also trails the streaming market leaders in engagement. Its streamers accounted for 2.5% of US TV viewership in December, according to Nielsen, versus 9% for Netflix and 4.7% for Disney's streaming services.\n\nEllison has talked about making Paramount a tech-first company and is focused on building a streaming business that can compete with Netflix. To that end, he's currently locked in a battle with Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nParamount's exploration of short-form video and user-generated content also suggests that Ellison is keen to fight with YouTube and TikTok for viewership time. YouTube has been one of the biggest winners from the shift away from traditional TV and toward free streamers.\n\nBelow are Paramount's priorities for Paramount+ and Pluto TV in the first quarter, according to the leaked presentation. The slides have been reformatted with minor changes for clarity, with notes from Business Insider bolded in square brackets. Not all terms or references in the slides are immediately clear.",

However, Paramount is also interested in hosting user-generated content, which is the backbone of platforms like YouTube and TikTok. \"UGC\" was listed in the \"Mobile App Brainstorms\" section of a Paramount+ priorities presentation viewed by Business Insider.\n\nA person familiar with Paramount's short-form video plans said that the appeal of UGC is that it could be \"cheap and brings eyes to Paramount.\"\n\nAnother person familiar with Paramount's thinking said there are many products and initiatives in testing on the streaming side, and that the results of those tests would determine leadership's priorities.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nParamount hasn't previously done much with short-form video, outside a limited offering of trailers, clips, and interviews on its streaming app and social platforms like YouTube. It doesn't have a dedicated short-form feed on Paramount+.\n\nParamount's planned move into short-form video comes as CEO David Ellison implements his tech-first vision — and as Oracle, the software giant cofounded by his father, Larry Ellison, just became one of the select owners of TikTok's US business.\n\nDisney has also announced plans to put short-form video and UGC into Disney+ using AI, through a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI announced in December.\n\nNetflix, the leader among paid streamers, has experimented with short-form vertical video on its service, and co-CEO Greg Peters said on the company's mid-January earnings call that it's redesigning its mobile app with short-form video to compete with social media apps and \"better serve the expansion of our business over the decade to come.\"\n\nAudiences, especially young people, have become hooked on short-form video through TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. Hollywood is looking to get in on the action with so-called \"micro-dramas,\" mobile-focused shows with bite-sized episodes that are often soapy dramas.\n\nThe changes in consumption patterns among viewers come as traditional TV continues to lose customers and social video rises.",

    "fullText": "UFC is already a hit for Paramount+.\n\nParamount's flagship streaming service generated about a million new subscribers on the day of its first-ever UFC event, Paramount product chief Dane Glasgow told employees in a town hall on Tuesday morning, three staffers who attended the meeting told Business Insider.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson said: \"Those numbers are unverified, and it's against our policy to share speculative data externally.\"\n\nIn August, Paramount did a deal with UFC parent TKO that will see it pay $7.7 billion to secure UFC rights in the US for seven years.\n\nGlasgow said at the town hall that Saturday was the second-largest day of sign-ups ever for its streamer, and that UFC 324 was the second-most-streamed sporting event on the service, according to two employees.\n\nNotably, Paramount made its UFC matches available for anyone with a Paramount+ subscription, which starts at $8.99 a month. Before the Paramount deal, many UFC matches were only on pay-per-view for around $80 each.\n\nParamount previously announced that its UFC broadcast had just under 5 million average viewers for the main card. Paramount CEO David Ellison told staffers in an email that it was \"the largest-ever exclusive live event for Paramount+.\" The streamer has drawn larger audiences to other non-exclusive live events, including NFL games that ran on both Paramount+ and CBS.\n\n\"This record-breaking performance is, above all, a testament to the extraordinary teamwork across our entire company,\" Ellison told employees in his memo, which was obtained by Business Insider.\n\nFor context, Netflix's Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight added about 1.4 million US subscribers to that service in November 2024, according to the subscription data firm Antenna. The firm only tracks US data.\n\nAntenna estimated that Paramount+ reeled in an estimated 3.2 million new US customers when it hosted the Super Bowl in 2024.\n\nRead Ellison's full memo to employees below:\n\nA huge congratulations to everyone who contributed to the success of our first UFC event on Paramount+! Several members of our leadership team and I were cageside Saturday night, and we were completely blown away by the experience and by the intensity, skill and heart on display across the card. We left the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas more excited and energized than ever about our partnership with Dana White and the entire TKO/UFC team.\n\nI've heard from several executives at TKO/UFC, and they also could not be more pleased with how everything came together. It was a fantastic start to our 7-year partnership!\n\nWhile we went into the weekend with high expectations, I'm thrilled to share that we exceeded them, reaching nearly 5 million streaming views — the largest-ever exclusive live event for Paramount+. And the actual audience was likely even higher, given how common co-viewing is among UFC fans.\n\nThis record-breaking performance is, above all, a testament to the extraordinary teamwork across our entire company. Every single business unit, division and team — from Paramount+, Paramount Pictures and CBS to MTV, BET, Nickelodeon and Pluto, as well as Marketing, Social, Ad Sales, Technology, Events and more — came together, rolled up their sleeves and got creative. The incredible power of Paramount One to reach the broadest possible audience was on full display companywide, and UFC 324 stands as our strongest example yet of what we can achieve when we all work together toward a common goal.\n\nAgain, hats off to everyone. With nearly 5 million streaming views and record-breaking engagement, UFC 324 set the bar high, and we can't wait to keep the momentum going at UFC 325 next weekend in Sydney!",

    "title": "Leaked audio: Bari Weiss tells staff CBS News is 'toast' if it can't evolve beyond broadcast news",
    "description": "Bari Weiss outlined her vision for CBS News in an all-hands meeting after ruffling feathers in the months since Paramount CEO David Ellison hired her.",
    "fullText": "In a town hall on Tuesday, Bari Weiss shared her vision for CBS News and some tough \"truth\" with her staff.\n\nThe CBS News editor in chief, who was handpicked by Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, told employees that the company must evolve beyond broadcast TV and earn audience trust.\n\n\"Our strategy until now has been to cling to the audience that remains on broadcast television. I'm here to tell you that if we stick to that strategy, we're toast,\" Weiss said on the all-hands call, according to a recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nWeiss added that \"CBS News is still in a linear mentality and we need to shift to a streaming mentality immediately.\"\n\n\"The honest truth is, right now, we are not producing a product that enough people want,\" Weiss said. She added that the staff can't entirely blame factors like \"demographics, or technology, or ADHD, or fractured attention spans, or news avoidance\" for audience declines.\n\nThe CBS News top editor also announced she's adding \"many more\" contributors, including writers and podcasters, to the news network.\n\nAfter the call, CBS News announced 19 new contributors, including former Atlantic writer Derek Thompson, former general H.R. McMaster, and happiness expert Arthur Brooks.\n\nWeiss, a former newspaper opinion editor with little prior TV experience and an anti-establishment streak, was an unconventional pick to lead a 99-year-old broadcast network. She made a name for herself in 2020 by loudly resigning from The New York Times, alleging anti-conservative bias. Weiss then started the news and opinion site The Free Press, which Paramount bought for $150 million in October.\n\nNotably, Weiss reports directly to Ellison rather than to Tom Cibrowski, the president of CBS News. As CBS News editor in chief, Weiss has been given a green light to shake up the broadcast network, which has trailed competitors ABC News and NBC News for years, and transform it for the digital age.\n\nIn her first memo to CBS News staffers, Weiss shared her 10 core tenets, including a pledge to prioritize \"journalism that is fair, fearless, and factual.\"\n\n\"I don't want to live in an America where there is no trust in our great institutions,\" Weiss said on the Tuesday call.\n\nWeiss later added that \"trust in mainstream news organizations and the legacy press\" is at \"historic lows, and it's not hard to understand why.\"\n\nWeiss has attracted controversy during her first few months at the helm of CBS News.\n\nHer commitment to hard-hitting journalism was questioned inside and outside CBS News after her late-hour decision to pull a \"60 Minutes\" segment about the Trump administration deporting migrants to the CECOT prison in El Salvador.\n\nWeiss defended her decision to delay the CECOT prison segment in a memo to employees, saying that CBS News had to do \"more legwork\" to \"win back\" the trust of American audiences.\n\nThe segment eventually aired on \"60 Minutes\" weeks later, with minor changes to the in-studio postscript, Puck reported.\n\nOne example of Weiss' vision to broaden CBS News' audience by appealing to conservatives was a town hall featuring Erika Kirk, the wife of late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nWeiss also installed longtime anchor Tony Dokoupil as host of the \"CBS Evening News\" program. Dokoupil has supported Weiss' shake-up of the network and has said the mainstream press puts \"too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites.\" He has attracted some criticism early in his new role for what was widely seen as a softball segment with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nWeiss made waves inside the company from the start of her tenure. Just days into her role, she asked staffers to send memos explaining their roles, what they did on a typical day, and how the broadcast network could improve.\n\nOn Tuesday, Weiss acknowledged the controversy around her hiring, saying that \"in the face of all of this outside noise, you might feel uncertain or skeptical about me.\"\n\n\"What I can give you today is what I've always tried to give my readers and listeners as a journalist,\" she said. \"Transparency, clarity, and straight talk.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nHave a tip or thoughts on Bari Weiss' strategy for CBS News?

    "fullText": "UFC 324 went down last night (Sat., Jan 24, 2026) inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, ushering a new pay-per-view (PPV)-less era for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), which also signaled the beginning of its partnership with Paramount+. In the main event of the evening, Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett put on a show for 25 minutes, which ultimately resulted in a unanimous decision win for “The Highlight,” giving him the interim Lightweight title in the process (highlights here). In the co-headlining act Sean O’ Malley got back to his winning ways by defeating Song Yadong via unanimous decision (see it again here).\n\nIt was far from a walk in the park but Gaethje did enough to win the interim strap by defeating a tough foe in Pimblett after five rounds of back-and-forth action. For 25 minutes, Gaethje came out like a bat out of hell throwing big bombs every chance he got trying to put “The Baddy” away. To his credit, Pimblett took a lot of big shots and still stayed in the pocket and delivered some of his own. But it was Gaethje who got the better of the exchanges throughout the fight, dropping “The Baddy” a few times and busting up his face all night. With the win, the power-punching Lightweight wins his second interim belt and locked down a title unification bout against division king, Ilia Topuria, later this year.\n\n“Suga” needed a win in a bad way coming into his fight against Song Yadong because he was on a two-fight skid — both defeats against Merab Dvalishvili — and a third straight loss would have meant a title fight would be hard to come by. But O’ Malley looked rejuvenated after his time off, sticking to what brought him to the big show by using his reach, footwork and striking to get in and out while getting his licks in. Yadong did have a few good moments but once “Suga” found his groove it was all downhill for the Chinese-born contender. With the win O’ Malley has a glimmer of hope to get back into the championship picture, though he will likely need one more win to get there.\n\nHonorable Mention: Waldo Cortes-Acosta\n\nThe UFC’s Heavyweight division has a new threat to the throne on its hands after “Salsa Boy” secured one of the, if not the, biggest fight of his UFC career after knocking out Derrick Lewis in the second round (highlights). Cortes-Acosta pretty much pitched a shutout, proving to be too quick for “Black Beast,” showing off his speed to evade his foe’s big bombs. He was light on his feet all night and used it to get in and out, dropping the big man and then eventually finishing him off with some vicious ground-and-pound. He is currently ranked No. 5 in the division, so we can expect him to move up a spot or two following his latest conquest.\n\nLewis put on one of his most dreadful performances against Cortes-Acosta, failing to put up any offense in what truly was a puzzling showing for one of the most dangerous and entertaining fighters in the history of the sport. He could not find his range all night, though that was in large part to “Salsa Boy’s” quickness and footwork. Lewis kept overextending on his shots and all he caught was air for the most part. In the second round, Cortes-Acosta tagged Lewis with a soft jab that may or may not have been the reason he fell to the canvas, as the broadcast team was adamant he slipped. Once there, Lewis was like a fish out of water because his foe started unloading on him until the referee stepped in to put an end to a dreadful fight. The loss snaps Lewis’ two-fight win streak and has many wondering if his heart is in it anymore.\n\nFor more UFC 324: “Gaethje vs. Pimblett” news and notes be sure to hit up our comprehensive event archive right here.",

    "fullText": "At long last Zuffa Boxing is set to kick off its debut event later TONIGHT (Fri., Jan. 23, 2026) as Zuffa Boxing 1 is set to go down inside Meta’s Apex in Las Vegas, Nevada. Headlining the event — which will streaming live on Paramount+ — will be a Middleweight showdown between Irish sensation, Callum Walsh, taking on Carlos Ocampo.\n\nWalsh was Dana White’s first-ever signing to his upstart boxing promotion, so it makes sense to have him kickoff the debut event. “King” is undefeated (15-0) with 11 knockouts and is coming off a unanimous decision win over Fernando Vargas Jr. on the “Canelo vs. Crawford”-led undercard in Las Vegas, Nevada, back in Sept. 2025 (full results here). As for Ocampo, he is coming in with a record of 38-3 and is currently riding a three-fight win streak into a bout he hopes will give him the spotlight should he pull off the massive upset.\n\nIt’s an important night for White and Co. since the debut fight card to his boxing venture will either silence a lot of doubters (such as this one), or give them more fuel to spit verbal venom at him for trying to change things up to a combat sport that has marched to the beat of the same drum for decades.\n\nWe don’t expect it to be perfect, but all eyes will be on this event.\n\nMany readers check in before, during and after the fights to share their thoughts on all of the action, as the card kicks off at 6 p.m. ET on Paramount+. Feel free to leave a comment (or several) about the bouts and chat with all the other Maniacs during the show — it’s always a lot of fun!\n\n160 lbs: Callum Walsh vs. Carlos Ocampo\n160 lbs: Misael Rodriguez Olivas vs. Austin Deanda\n147 lbs: Julian Rodriguez vs. Cain Sandoval \n126 lbs: Omar Trinidad vs. Max Ornelas \n118 lbs: Floyd Diaz vs. Guillermo Gutierrez \n118lbs: Emiliano Cardenas vs. Marcus Cortez Harris – Cardenas via unanimous decision\n135 lbs: Robert Meriwether III vs. Cesar Correa – Merriwether III via unanimous decision\n135 lbs: Troy Nash vs. Jacob Ramos – Nash via unanimous decision\n\nWe've got some ACTION at #ZuffaBoxing01💥#RiyadhSeason | @RiyadhSeason pic.twitter.com/9K4xHMg5Lc\n\n— Zuffa_Boxing (@Zuffa_Boxing) January 23, 2026\n\nOPENING UP THE FIRST ZUFFA BOXING CARD EVER‼️\n\n🇺🇸 @RealTroyNash v Jaycob Ramos 🇺🇸\n\nLIVE on @ParamountPlus | #RiyadhSeason | @RiyadhSeason pic.twitter.com/JdiFSpLuoQ\n\n— Zuffa_Boxing (@Zuffa_Boxing) January 23, 2026\n\nIT'S ALMOST TIME 🥊#ZuffaBoxing01 kicks off at the top of the hour!\n\nWatch here: https://t.co/bgoL7klXvE | #RiyadhSeason | @RiyadhSeason pic.twitter.com/2Sd0KqPKEJ\n\n— Zuffa_Boxing (@Zuffa_Boxing) January 23, 2026",

    "description": "Paramount is giving more power to a streaming data and insights executive as part of David Ellison's plan to make Paramount into a tech-first company.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison is showing that his tech-first vision for Paramount Skydance isn't just talk.\n\nEllison is taking his data-focused strategy to a new level by elevating Jason Kim, Paramount's EVP of data and insights, to oversee data for the entire company, instead of just the direct-to-consumer division.\n\nThe change was announced by Domenic DiMeglio — who heads up marketing as well as data and insights for Paramount's streaming division — in a Thursday afternoon staff meeting, a recording of which was obtained by Business Insider.\n\nKim's increased remit comes a day after Ellison, Paramount's CEO, met with company leadership in its New York offices.\n\n\"It's a wonderful opportunity for Jason — and for the team overall — to start playing a bigger role for what's happening at Paramount as we move forward,\" DiMeglio said in the meeting.\n\nDiMeglio added that Kim's bigger role is part of \"David's vision of trying to transform ourselves into being a tech-first media company — and, really, the most tech-forward media company in this space.\"\n\nEllison has remade Paramount in other ways since taking control of the company in August, including securing US UFC rights, hiring Bari Weiss to lead CBS News, and attempting to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWhile Paramount already had data and analytics teams across the company, it now has a new point person to oversee those efforts.\n\n\"I would hope and expect that, little by little, we're going to bring those silos down,\" DiMeglio said. He added it's \"not easy work.\"\n\nDane Glasgow, Paramount's chief product officer, said in an email to employees that \"these updates are part of a broader effort to focus our investments, reduce fragmentation, and move faster as one team.\"\n\nParamount's streaming team has become familiar with change. Last week, Paramount's streaming product and tech chief, Vibol Hou, told colleagues he was leaving at the end of January, Business Insider reported.\n\n\"You could probably sense that there's been some musical chairs stuff going on within the organization at large,\" Kim said. \"And that's not unique. That's sort of true of any company that's undergoing a large-scale organizational transformation, like the one that we're in the midst of now.\"\n\nContinuing the musical chairs analogy, Kim said that this change signals that \"this is our chair — we're here to stay.\"\n\nAlthough Paramount laid off about 1,000 employees in October, a few months after its Skydance merger closed, Kim downplayed the idea that this data and insights shake-up signals that more cuts are ahead.\n\n\"I don't think our scope is going to get smaller here. It is only going to get larger,\" Kim said. \"And I think those are all exciting tailwinds for us as a team.\"\n\nKim added that \"there might be more consolidation in the future, but that's going to be into our team.\"\n\nTwo Paramount employees in the meeting told Business Insider they were happy to hear about the change.\n\n\"It is exciting, given that we will have a lot more visibility than we used to,\" one employee on this team said.\n\nAnother staffer said this change indicates that Paramount is \"somewhat serious about the 'tech'-ification of the company.\"",

    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance has asked most of its employees to return to the office five days a week, and now it's asking them how in-person work is going.\n\nDavid Ellison's company asked employees to grade its RTO efforts by filling out a quick survey asking for feedback on \"what's working well and where we can improve to better support you.\"\n\n\"We want to know where there are challenges so we can contact you directly if needed to understand how to address your concerns,\" Paramount told employees in the RTO survey, which was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nIn the survey, Paramount asked employees about 12 aspects of the return-to-office process, from parking availability to bathroom cleanliness. Staffers could indicate whether they were highly satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, or strongly dissatisfied with each part of the RTO push, or note if it wasn't applicable to them. There was a comment box after each section.\n\nParamount said in an email on Friday that it would randomly award 10 survey respondents with 100 \"Paramount Celebrates\" points that can be used on Amazon or merchandise from the \"Paramount Swag Store.\" The company told staffers that their survey responses weren't anonymous, so they could be pooled by office location and shared with Paramount's RTO task force.\n\nFour Paramount staffers told Business Insider they felt their company's in-person push from two days to five days had gone smoothly so far. Three New York-based employees complimented the free snacks, which included protein bars and Oreos.\n\n\"They've made an effort to be supportive of everyone returning, offering snacks and a distributed workforce of 'ambassadors' who help out with different office requests on each floor,\" one New York-based staffer said. This person said that although five days a week in person was still a drawback for them, they felt the new in-office routine was \"reasonable.\"\n\nA second New York-based employee said that Paramount had been making a \"good effort to improve things around the office.\" This staffer said it's \"nice to finally have my own desk every day and not fight for a spot.\" Before the RTO mandate, some Paramount employees didn't have assigned seats.\n\nDespite the influx of employees, a Paramount manager said that the New York office hadn't felt too crowded. This person added that many meetings still took place over calls because their team is mostly bicoastal.\n\nHave a tip or thoughts on Paramount's RTO process?

    "fullText": "With each passing couple months, the chances that Conor McGregor ever will fight in the UFC get slimmer and slimmer.\n\nThat's not something the former fighter or his fans likely ever would admit, or the UFC brass, for that matter, but that's just the cold, hard math.\n\nAnd if a person purporting to be McGregor is to be trusted, there may be another hint now available about his future. On a video game live stream, a person who claimed to be McGregor and sounded like the Irishman said because of the UFC's new broadcast deal with Paramount+, which eliminated the traditional pay-per-view model, his contract is, in essence, void and needs to be reworked.\n\nThat, the purported McGregor said, will take place in February.\n\nConor McGregor said he has to negotiate a new contract with the UFC next month 👀\n\n“My contract is essentially void right now.” pic.twitter.com/c7wVzFEkIG\n\n— Happy Punch (@HappyPunch) January 18, 2026\n\nIn July, it will be five years since McGregor (22-6 MMA, 10-4 UFC) last fought. He broke his leg in a second straight loss to Dustin Poirier at UFC 264. He coached Season 31 of \"The Ultimate Fighter\" opposite Michael Chandler (23-10 MMA, 2-5 UFC) and was supposed to fight him, but that never has come to fruition despite Chandler desperately pining for it, and McGregor consistently teasing it. UFC CEO Dana White recently took it off the table nearly entirely.\n\nSunday, the former UFC fighter continued his years-long spiral with a lengthy proclamation that he once again has seen the light – this time thanks to a hallucinogenic treatment in Mexico.\n\nThis past November, McGregor said he saw his own death, when it was going to happen, and how it would impact the four children he has with Dee Devlin, whom he recently married after years together. Then, he said, Jesus descended from heaven and put a crown on his head to save him during a hallucinogenic treatment in Mexico..\n\n\"To God, I am yours,\" McGregor posted on social media. \"Thank you for bestowing upon me this incredible blessing that I take with great care and absolute seriousness! I live my life per your word and nothing more.\"\n\nLast year, McGregor dropped out of a bid to become the next president of Ireland. He couldn't get support to even get his name on the ballot, so he wasn't actually in the race. McGregor has said he aspires to political office in the near future and has taken up a nationalistic right-wing rallying cry similar to Donald Trump in that pursuit. Like Trump, McGregor has multiple sexual assault accusations against him, and like Trump, a ruling against him for one, too.\n\nMcGregor was found liable for the 2018 sexual assault of Nikita Hand in a Dublin hotel. Then McGregor lost his appeal to have the decision reversed. After that, McGregor made a plea to his countrywomen and countrymen to stand with him in the wake of the mountain of civil and criminal charges against him over the years, and the civil rape and sexual assault trial that came home to roost. A poll found that just 7 percent of people said they would vote for McGregor to be president of Ireland.\n\nMcGregor also is part-owner of the BKFC and his appearances at those events are regular.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Conor McGregor purportedly says UFC contract void in Paramount era",

She’s currently part of CBS Sports’ Champions League coverage.\n\nScott will take over desk anchor duties for UFC 324, filling in for Karyn Bryant.\n\nThe commentary team at T-Mobile Arena will feature Joe Rogan, Jon Anik and Daniel Cormier.\n\nMegan Olivi returns as roving reporter, while Din Thomas provides coaching insights throughout the event. And Bruce Buffer, as always, will handle fighter introductions inside the Octagon.\n\nEven if Kate Scott’s name doesn’t immediately ring a bell, many MMA fans might remember her from a memorable incident involving Khabib Nurmagomedov.\n\nThe clip circulated widely online, as he greeted three men with handshakes before placing his hand over his heart instead of shaking Scott’s hand.\n\nThe former UFC lightweight champion received some criticism for not offering a handshake to Scott.\n\nCormier added: “If you know his religion, that’s the way it is. Not many men are willing to do that, especially in that moment.\n\n“I’m pretty sure he explained it to her afterwards, but it’s live TV, right? Things happen. That’s respect to his wife, and honestly, it’s respect to Kate. It’s actually a respectful gesture to the person you’re refusing to shake hands [with] because he, as a married man, shouldn’t shake the hand of another woman.”",

    "fullText": "David Ellison's Paramount Skydance just suffered another setback, this time in its legal fight with Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nA Delaware judge ruled against Paramount, which had sued WBD in hopes of getting a court order forcing its acquisition target to quickly release information about how the company valued its cable networks.\n\nThe value of WBD's cable TV networks is a key difference between Paramount's and Netflix's rival bids. Paramount wants to buy them while Netflix does not.\n\nParamount's effort was unsuccessful, as the Delaware Court of Chancery's Morgan Zurn ruled against Paramount's motion for a summary judgment seeking expedited discovery on Thursday morning.\n\n\"Paramount has not shown it will suffer cognizable irreparable harm if expedition is not granted,\" Zurn said in her ruling.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson said in a statement that the company \"continues to urge WBD to make these disclosures so that WBD shareholders can make an informed decision.\"\n\nWBD said in a statement that the company was pleased the court \"rejected the notion that this lawsuit needed special treatment and may have other serious flaws.\"\n\nParamount has made eight offers to buy WBD, which have been rejected by WBD's board of directors in favor of its Netflix deal. However, Paramount still thinks its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD, including its cable networks like CNN, is superior to Netflix's cash-and-stock bid of $27.75 per share for WBD's studio and HBO assets.\n\nSince Netflix does not want to buy WBD's cable TV networks, their value could determine whether WBD shareholders choose Paramount's rival, hostile bid. Paramount hoped the court would require WBD to disclose how it valued its cable channels.\n\n\"For stockholders to understand the difference between those two transactions, they need certain basic information that they don't have today,\" Quinn Emanuel lawyer Mike Barlow said on behalf of Paramount. Barlow argued WBD's shareholders \"are being harmed\" every day that they don't have WBD's valuation of its TV networks.\n\nWBD's legal team — led by Ryan McLeod from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz — said there was \"zero emergency\" to disclose WBD's valuation of its cable assets and \"no threat\" of clear, irreparable harm to Paramount that required it to immediately release that information.\n\nMcLeod, from WBD's team, argued that there wasn't a rush for WBD to disclose how it valued its cable networks, saying that Paramount's January 21 deadline for WBD shareholders to give Paramount control of their shares was an arbitrary date that could easily be moved.\n\nTo that point, Paramount's Barlow said that the company \"fully intends to extend this tender offer,\" which would give WBD shareholders more time to decide whether to tender their shares.\n\nJudge Zurn ruled in WBD's favor, reasoning that \"Paramount as a stockholder was not misled by any omissions\" from WBD, since Ellison's company wasn't deciding whether to take its own offer.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance is convinced its offer for Warner Bros. is better than Netflix's offer. Read CEO David Ellison's new letter to WBD shareholders.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison has chosen to continue the fight for control of Warner Bros. Discovery, this time in court.\n\nThe Paramount Skydance CEO has made eight attempts to buy WBD, all of which have been rebuffed. That includes his most recent $30-per-share bid, which was spurned in favor of Netflix's offer. Paramount is attempting to acquire the entire company, including its TV networks, such as CNN, TBS, and TNT. Netflix's cash-and-stock offer is $27.75 per share for just WBD's studio and streaming assets.\n\nNow, Paramount is suing WBD \n\nIf WBD's Global Networks business — the division that houses its cable TV networks — is worth substantially less than $2.25 per share, then Paramount's $30-per-share bid could look more attractive to shareholders than Netflix's proposal. Paramount has argued that WBD's cable channels have a $0-per-share equity value, implying they're worth about as much as the estimated $15 billion in debt that WBD intends to saddle them with.\n\n\"WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its 'risk adjustment' of our $30 per share all-cash offer,\" Ellison wrote to WBD investors.\n\nParamount is also initiating a so-called proxy fight where it tries to get representatives on WBD's board of directors.\n\nFor now, Paramount isn't raising the price of its bid. Instead, it is sticking with its all-cash, $30-per-share proposal in hopes that WBD shareholders will see something the board doesn't.\n\n\"WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount,\" Ellison wrote. \"But what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer.\"\n\nParamount appears to be set on finding ways it can win control of WBD without paying more money in a renewed bidding war.\n\n\"Paramount will continue to use all avenues to wrestle WBD away from Netflix,\" said Ross Benes, an analyst at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. \"Lawsuits, shareholder appeals, proxy battles, and so on, individually have little chance of swinging the merger. These tactics are part of a broader strategy to keep pressing until something gives and then seizing on that opportunity.\"\n\nRead Ellison's full letter to WBD shareholders:\n\nDear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder,\n\nOver the last few days, following the decision by Warner Bros. Discovery (\"WBD\") not to engage with Paramount on our $30 per share cash offer to acquire all of WBD, and our reaffirmation of our commitment to delivering our superior offer to WBD shareholders, we keep getting the same question: what happens next?\n\nParamount started this process about four months ago with a private offer at a significant premium to WBD's $12.54 share price, and our pursuit culminated in the $30 per share all-cash, fully financed proposal we made before WBD entered into the Netflix transaction. When we learned of the terms of that transaction, which are inferior both financially and from the standpoint of timing and certainty of closing, we decided to bring our offer directly to you, through our tender offer.\n\nWe are committed to seeing our tender offer through. We understand, however, that unless the WBD board of directors decides to exercise its right to engage with us under the Netflix merger agreement (the \"Netflix Agreement\"), this will likely come down to your vote at a shareholder meeting. We do not know whether that will be at WBD's upcoming annual meeting or a special meeting. The \"advance notice\" window for WBD's 2026 annual meeting opens in three weeks, and Paramount will nominate a slate of directors who, in accordance with their fiduciary duties, will exercise WBD's right under the Netflix Agreement to engage on Paramount's offer and enter into a transaction with Paramount. In addition, Paramount will propose an amendment to WBD's bylaws to require WBD shareholder approval for any separation of Global Networks. If WBD calls a special meeting ahead of its annual meeting to vote on the Netflix Agreement, Paramount will solicit proxies against such approval. These actions, coupled with our tender offer, ensure that you get the final decision on which offer is better for you.\n\nWBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer. Our $30 per share in cash is simply more than Netflix's complex multi-variable consideration comprised of (a) $23.25 in cash plus (b) a number of Netflix shares currently worth $4.11 (at Friday's close) plus (c) the to-be-issued Global Networks equity which we have analyzed as having zero equity value1. In addition to not disclosing the value of the to-be-issued Global Networks spin off, WBD has not disclosed the mechanism by which any debt transferred from Global Networks to the Streaming & Studios segment reduces the cash and stock consideration payable to you.\n\nAlong with the WBD shareholders, we have asked for the customary financial disclosure a board is supposed to provide shareholders when making an investment recommendation. But in each of its 14D-9 filings, WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its \"risk adjustment\" of our $30 per share all-cash offer. WBD shareholders need this information to make an informed investment decision on our offer — and importantly, Delaware law has consistently required that such information be provided to shareholders. Following the process prescribed under Delaware law, we filed suit this morning in Delaware Chancery Court to ask the court to simply direct WBD to provide this information so that WBD shareholders have what they need to be able to make an informed decision as to whether to tender their shares into our offer.\n\nWe do not undertake any of these actions lightly. Make no mistake, our goal remains to have constructive discussions with WBD's Board to reach an agreement that is in the best interests of WBD shareholders. Our objective from the moment we approached WBD was for a collaborative negotiation and a successful transaction that would be a win for both companies, both shareholder groups and all stakeholders. We remain perplexed that WBD never responded to our December 4th offer, never attempted to clarify or negotiate any of the terms in that proposal, nor traded markups of contracts with us. Even as we read WBD's own narrative of its process, we are struck that there were few actual board meetings in the period leading up to the decision to accept an inferior transaction with Netflix. And we are surprised by the lack of transparency on WBD's part regarding basic financial matters. It just doesn't add up — much like the math on how WBD continues to favor taking less than our $30 per share all-cash offer for its shareholders.\n\nThe best outcome for you and for us would be if WBD's Board would exercise the right it has under the Netflix Agreement to engage with Paramount. If it does so, we will be open and constructive to secure the best path forward for WBD and each of you. We have demonstrated our willingness to listen carefully to any feedback we receive from WBD's Board and to respond by offering reasonable solutions — and that remains our mindset and approach.\n\nI believe in our vision for how we can bring these great companies together and deliver for consumers, the creative community and of course, for you. Paramount is committed, my family is committed, and hopefully this helps answer the question of what comes next.\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer",

    "fullText": "For weeks, fans have wondered why No. 1–ranked Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Lightweight Arman Tsarukyan was passed over for the interim title fight at UFC 324, which goes down in two weeks in Las Vegas.\n\nWas he still paying for his last-minute withdrawal from UFC 311?\nDid his altercation with a fan come back to haunt him?\nWhat about his recent headbutt of Dan Hooker?\n\nAs it turns out, it was a little bit of everything.\n\nIn a recent interview with streamer Adin Ross, the 29-year-old revealed that UFC officials intentionally left him off the promotion’s first-ever Paramount card because of the baggage surrounding him.\n\n“I was supposed to fight for the title, and then they said, ‘You’re too dangerous to put you on the first card on Paramount because of the headbutt, pull-out, beating up fans,’” Tsarukyan said. “They told me I had to wait. What can I do? I’ll just wait. I know the belt will be mine. I work every day for it. It is what it is.”\n\nJust days earlier, UFC CEO Dana White confirmed that Tsarukyan’s headbutt of Hooker played a major role in the promotion choosing Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett instead.\n\nThere’s no denying Tsarukyan has had a rough year — and largely brought it on himself. His late withdrawal from UFC 311 threw that card into chaos, landing him in MMA purgatory. Then came the Hooker headbutt, which could have derailed the UFC Qatar main event and appears to have been the final straw.\n\nUFC officials also haven’t forgotten Tsarukyan punching a fan during his walkout at UFC 300, nor the altercation with King Green at a UFC host hotel in Dallas back in 2023.\n\nSimply put, Tsarukyan has been a walking headache for the promotion over the last couple of years.\n\nThere’s currently no timetable for his Octagon return, and it appears, according to the UFC head honcho, that he’ll need to fight — and beat — another top contender to earn his way back into the UFC’s good graces.\n\nIn the meantime, Tsarukyan has stayed busy on the mats. He recently competed at Real American Freestyle (RAF), where he dominated former four-time NCAA Division I All-American Lance Palmer, earning a 10-0 technical fall (watch highlights).",

    "fullText": "France has decided to delay this year’s Group of 7 Summit in order to avoid a scheduling conflict with UFC’s upcoming White House event on June 14, which will also be President Donald Trump’s 80th birthday.\n\nWhile UFC fans are excited for 2026 as a whole as the promotion moves from ESPN to Paramount+, a lot of discussion has revolved around the upcoming UFC fight card on the White House lawn this summer. After all, it’s turning out to be a once-in-a-lifetime event full of incredible spectacles, UFC champions, and world-class guests.\n\nThe event is expected to garner such attention and attract dignitaries from around the world that France isn’t willing to go head-to-head with UFC on Trump’s birthday. Can you blame them?\n\n🚨 France is delaying this year’s G7 summit to avoid a scheduling conflict with the UFC White House event on June 14 👀\n\n(via @politico) pic.twitter.com/0XXqSHM8IS\n\n— Championship Rounds (@ChampRDS) January 9, 2026\n\nAccording to a recent report by news outlet Politico, France will move its annual G7 Summit — which seven major industrial countries discuss key global policy issues — from June 14-16 to June 15-17. This clears the way for UFC’s White House card and Trump’s birthday bash on June 14. French President Emmanuel Macron’s office declined to confirm that the rescheduling is directly related to the UFC event and said the change of date is “the result of our consultations with G7 partners.”\n\nWhen asked about the G7 Summit delay a White House official told Politico: “As the leader of the free world, our partners believed that President Trump’s attendance at the G7 Summit was essential. They kindly shifted dates to accommodate the U.S. president’s schedule.”\n\nDana White reshares the news that France has delayed the 2026 G7 summit to avoid a scheduling conflict with the UFC White House event. 😅 pic.twitter.com/xKiSKRSgx3\n\n— MMA Orbit (@mma_orbit) January 9, 2026\n\nFor more UFC White House 2026 news and coverage click HERE.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance called employees back to the office five days a week. CEO David Ellison said there had already been \"increased productivity.\"",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance's return-to-office push is underway, and CEO David Ellison is taking a moment to thank staffers for showing up.\n\nStarting Monday, Paramount employees assigned to the company's New York and Los Angeles offices were expected to return to the office five days a week, as announced by Ellison in September. (Some workers, including those who aren't assigned to an office, are in \"Phase 2\" of the RTO rollout, with more details coming later this year.)\n\nStaffers who couldn't, or wouldn't, make the change were offered a severance package, which the company said about 600 workers took.\n\n\"I know that returning to the office full-time has been an adjustment for many, and I truly appreciate the flexibility and commitment you've shown,\" Ellison said in a companywide email on Friday afternoon, which was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nEllison added that \"the positive energy and increased productivity that come from being together in-person are already evident.\"\n\nThe Paramount CEO had said in a September memo announcing the five-day RTO push that \"in-person collaboration is absolutely vital to building and strengthening our culture and driving the success of our business.\"\n\nIn his latest missive, Ellison also thanked the \"RTO Task Force\" that got its offices ready for a surge of workers returning.\n\nParamount isn't alone in calling its employees back to the office. Several major media companies, including Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery, have asked their staff to return to in-person work.\n\nNBCUniversal instructed thousands of employees to return to its offices starting on January 5, although it's only requiring four days a week of in-person work. As with Paramount, staffers who didn't want to return to the office were offered severance packages.\n\nRead Ellison's full memo to employees here:\n\nAs we wrap up our first week back together in our LA and NY offices, I want to thank each of you for your dedication, professionalism, and teamwork. I know that returning to the office full-time has been an adjustment for many, and I truly appreciate the flexibility and commitment you've shown. The positive energy and increased productivity that come from being together in-person are already evident, and it's great to see.\n\nA special thank you to our RTO Task Force and all the teams involved for their hard work behind the scenes to prepare for our return and to ensure the transition was smooth and welcoming for everyone.\n\nIt's hard to believe we launched the new Paramount just five months ago, and in that short time we haven't just set a strategy — we've acted on it. In the process, we've made real and meaningful progress against our North Star priorities. From day one, our goal has been clear: to transform Paramount for the future by championing great storytellers, investing in world-class technology, and making bold, thoughtful moves that position us to help define the next era of entertainment. That's exactly what we've been doing — and it's what we'll continue to do together.\n\nWhile the coming year will bring its share of challenges, it will also be exciting. We've set ambitious goals, and we're confident we have the strategy, the momentum, and — most importantly — the team to achieve them. Your expertise, resilience, and commitment give me tremendous confidence in what we can accomplish. I am grateful for your efforts and incredibly proud to work alongside you.\n\nThanks again for a great first week back together. Let's go!",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance is still trying to stop Warner Bros. Discovery's Netflix deal. Here are the four most likely endings in the fight for WBD.",
    "fullText": "The war for Warner Bros. Discovery is getting intense.\n\nParamount Skydance isn't surrendering in its quest to buy WBD, even though its offers have been rejected eight times in favor of Netflix's bid.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison has criticized WBD for not selecting what he's called \"by far the superior offer.\"\n\nWBD has fired back, accusing Paramount of threatening lawsuits and leaking to the press. The company's board of directors said this week in a letter to shareholders that Paramount \"has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction.\"\n\nThere have been many twists and turns in Netflix and Paramount's battle for WBD, and the drama isn't over yet.\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios that could unfold.\n\nAlthough Paramount says its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD provides more value and less risk than Netflix's $27.75-per-share bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets, the company could up the ante.\n\nSeveral media insiders, including Disney's former top dealmaker, expect a renewed bidding war for WBD.\n\nTheir view got a boost when Paramount disclosed in a filing that Ellison had texted WBD CEO David Zaslav, saying that Paramount's $30-per-share proposal wasn't its \"best and final\" offer.\n\nWBD investors also seem to be counting on more fireworks, given that its stock is trading north of $28.50, close to $1 per share above Netflix's agreed-upon purchase price. That suggests shareholders believe either Ellison and company or Netflix will fork over more money before WBD changes hands.\n\nParamount might not need to offer another penny if a majority of WBD's shareholders tender their shares, which would put pressure on the board to reconsider its proposal.\n\nAs a public company, WBD's leadership is legally required to act in the best interests of its shareholders. Otherwise, its board could be sued. So, if WBD's investors overwhelmingly prefer Paramount's bid, the board could have no choice but to go with it.\n\nHowever, Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at Lightshed Partners, thinks Paramount won't convince a majority of WBD shareholders to tender their shares. Greenfield predicted that Paramount would then raise its offer to $32 per share, but that Netflix would respond by sweetening its offer, leading to Paramount eventually dropping its bid.\n\nUntil the Netflix deal closes, a competing proposal could come in, since WBD is a public company. Comcast drove up the eventual price of Disney's acquisition of Fox's studio by nearly $20 billion, even though its rival bid came in six months later.\n\nIf Paramount remains adamant that it has a superior proposal that wasn't chosen, it could sue WBD's board of directors, alleging negligence.\n\nWBD has acknowledged that possibility. Paramount \"has been aggressive in its engagement with WBD, has retained litigation counsel and has threatened litigation,\" WBD's board of directors wrote in a letter on Wednesday in which it rejected Paramount's latest offer.\n\nLawyer Raul Gastesi of Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella has taken note of Paramount's litigious posture and said that now that it has been turned down, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit.\"\n\nHowever, Reuben Miller, the head of antitrust at data intelligence firm Dealreporter, said that while Paramount is making waves in the court of public opinion, he believes they \"would rather come with an increased offer and avoid litigation than roll the dice in Delaware court.\"\n\nEven if Paramount decides not to sue, there's a chance WBD shareholders could take legal action against WBD's board.\n\nWhile Paramount has taken a hands-on approach to its WBD bid so far, it could let the chips fall and move on if its proposal doesn't win over enough WBD shareholders.\n\nInstead of spending more than $100 billion on WBD, Paramount could put money toward another acquisition, or simply invest in improving its technology and original content.",

    "fullText": "The head of Paramount Skydance's streaming product and tech is leaving the company, Business Insider has learned.\n\nVibol Hou told colleagues in the company's streaming tech Slack channel that he's leaving Paramount at the end of January.\n\n\"After nearly 12 years of exhilarating work pushing our businesses to new heights, it feels like the right time to hand the torch to the next wave of leaders while I take a much-needed pause to rest, focus on my health (including some serious marathon training), and spend more time with my family before I jump into whatever comes next,\" Hou wrote in the Slack message, which was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHou's exit has been anticipated within Paramount for months.\n\nIn Hou's Slack message, he referenced a previous memo from Dane Glasgow, Paramount's chief product officer, that hinted at the move.\n\n\"Vibol has expressed interest in exploring other opportunities, and while he will remain in his role with an anticipated transition early next year, we will continue to explore new projects together,\" Glasgow wrote in a mid-October email viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHou was at Paramount or its subsidiaries for over a decade, including six years at its free streamer, Pluto TV. In that span, Paramount went through several corporate changes, from a ViacomCBS merger to the Paramount Skydance merger that closed in the summer of 2025.\n\n\"What we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy,\" Hou wrote in the Slack message. \"But we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver.\"\n\nHou's Slack message was received warmly, with 118 \"care\" emojis, 67 classic \"red heart\" emojis, and 43 \"thank you\" emojis, among other signals of support as of early Thursday afternoon.\n\nSince Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison took over in early August, he's made several noteworthy moves, like landing UFC rights in the US and hiring Bari Weiss to lead CBS News.\n\nSeveral top executives have left the company as Ellison has taken control, including co-CEOs Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins, streaming head Tom Ryan, and international markets head Pam Kaufman.\n\nEllison is now focused on buying Warner Bros. Discovery, which has rejected its takeover offer eight times.\n\nParamount did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead Hou's Slack message to colleagues announcing the move:\n\nAs Dane shared in his note, I'll be transitioning out of my role and leaving the company at the end of January. After nearly 12 years of exhilarating work pushing our businesses to new heights, it feels like the right time to hand the torch to the next wave of leaders while I take a much-needed pause to rest, focus on my health (including some serious marathon training), and spend more time with my family before I jump into whatever comes next.\n\nWhat we've built together across Pluto TV, CBS All Access/Paramount+, and Network Streaming was never easy — but we built these products from the ground up, in tough environments that didn't necessarily believe in our vision, with limited resources and non-existent technology where we often had to build our own, and under constant pressure to deliver. Yet again and again, this team showed grit, creativity, and passion. Whether you came from Pluto or another part of Streaming, the story is the same: we took on impossible problems and innovated our way through.\n\nThe culture we live — being curious about everything, feeling that hunger to solve problems, caring deeply for others, iterating constantly, and innovating in everything we do — belongs to all of you now. You should be proud of what you've achieved, and you should be confident that this is a team that can handle anything thrown its way.\n\nAs to the future, I have a lot of confidence in Dane and the vision and strategic pillars he's laid out for the year ahead. They set a strong foundation for where this organization can go over the next several years, and I'm excited to see what you all do together under his leadership.\n\nI plan to hold my last open office hours next Friday so anyone who wants to drop in, ask questions, or just say hello/goodbye has a space to do that together. In the meantime, if you'd like to stay in touch beyond my time here, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.\n\nServing alongside you has been one of the great privileges of my life, and I'll be proudly cheering you on as you write the next chapter together.",

    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's leveraged buyout bid again, citing financial and litigation risk",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board raised its hackles on Wednesday while rejecting Paramount Skydance's bid for the eighth time in favor of Netflix's offer.\n\nWBD used pointed language, calling Paramount's bid the \"largest leveraged buyout in history by a wide margin\" and tying its potential failure to previous big LBOs that didn't close on the initially agreed-upon terms.\n\nIn its new filing, WBD also described Paramount's financial condition as \"not strong,\" noting that its credit was already rated \"junk\" by S&P before the \"extraordinary amount of debt financing\" required by the deal. Paramount, for its part, has emphasized that $40.4 billion in equity of its new bid is fully backstopped by Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nWBD's strong language suggests that the board and leadership \"just want to move on,\" and the \"largest LBO\" angle is a new and compelling one, Wharton M&A professor Paul Nary said on X.\n\nDavid Zaslav-led WBD also ramped up its accusations that Paramount has acted litigiously and leaked to the press.\n\nIn the filing, WBD cited new press reports in the New York Post indicating Paramount was considering abandoning its offer and might pursue \"DefCon 1\" litigation against WBD's board. WBD said that Paramount didn't deny the reports, suggesting that the company was leaking to the press. WBD had previously complained that there had been \"extensive media leaks and rumors\" about Paramount's proposals.\n\nM&A experts said the stepped-up language was likely drafted in anticipation of a lawsuit against WBD, either by Paramount or WBD shareholders.\n\nNow that Paramount has lost to Netflix, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit,\" said Raul Gastesi, a partner at Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella.\n\nCorey Martin, managing partner of Granderson Des Rochers, a law firm focused on entertainment and media, said the new filing felt calibrated to deter WBD shareholders from backing Paramount's hostile bid.\n\n\"The audience is really the shareholders, because there's always the risk of shareholder lawsuits,\" Martin said. \"It is colorful stuff, but Paramount's is a hostile bid.\"\n\nMartin also saw the emphasis on legal and press tactics as part of a PR strategy to portray Paramount as a bad actor, as well as a pre-litigation tactic.\n\nLightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a note on Wednesday that Paramount could still outbid Netflix, but it would \"require an overhaul of their current bid, and a dramatic increase in the cash invested from the Ellison family and/or their friends and financing partners.\"",

    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery just rejected David Ellison's takeover offer for the eighth time — and its CEO is telling employees why.\n\nWBD CEO David Zaslav sent a companywide memo on Wednesday morning, which was viewed by Business Insider, explaining why WBD is sticking with its Netflix deal.\n\nZaslav told staffers that WBD's board of directors did a \"thorough review\" of Paramount's latest offer and said they believe Netflix's offer is still superior.\n\n\"This review was conducted with discipline and rigor, and was supported by independent financial and legal advisors,\" Zaslav told employees.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders on Wednesday, WBD's board outlined two key reasons it was turning down Paramount's updated offer. First, the board said it offered \"insufficient value\" relative to Netflix's bid, due to additional costs like a break-up fee to Netflix. Second, they said there was a \"lack of certainty\" in Paramount's ability to consummate the deal because of an \"extraordinary amount of debt financing.\"\n\nParamount's latest deal had included $40.4 billion in equity fully backstopped by Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison and one of the richest people in the world.\n\nIn Zaslav's memo to staffers, he said the company's \"operating plans remain unchanged, and our priorities for 2026 are clear and intentional.\"\n\nWBD's CEO also encouraged employees to tune out the noise.\n\n\"What matters most right now is our focus as we start the year,\" Zaslav said, before thanking staffers for the \"focus, professionalism, and energy\" they bring to work.\n\nHe said the 2026 goals process for the company would launch in February.\n\nRead Zaslav's full memo to staffers here:\n\nThis communication has been sent to everyone at WBD.\n\nAs we begin the year, I want to share an update on where things stand and where we are focused.\n\nFollowing a thorough review, the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors has completed its consideration of Paramount Skydance's most recent proposal. After careful evaluation, the Board has determined not to pursue that proposal. You can read our statement here.\n\nThis review was conducted with discipline and rigor, and was supported by independent financial and legal advisors.\n\nWe continue to have a signed transaction agreement with Netflix, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The regulatory review process is underway, and during this period we will continue to operate the business and support our teams. For reference, a centralized collection of what we have previously shared on this topic is available on the One website.\n\nWhat matters most right now is our focus as we start the year. Our operating plans remain unchanged, and our priorities for 2026 are clear and intentional. The 2026 Goals process will be launched in February.\n\nAcross film, television, sports, news, streaming and games, we are delivering against a slate and strategy we believe strongly in. The work underway across the company reflects the creativity, momentum, and global reach that define us.\n\nThank you for the focus, professionalism, and energy you bring to your work. We enter this year confident in our direction and energized by what we are building for audiences and partners around the world.",

    "description": "Paramount+ is knocking out the old pay-per-view model, offering every marquee numbered UFC event and every Fight Night to subscribers.",
    "fullText": "Paramount+ just added a major “plus” for fans of mixed martial arts. Come Saturday, January 24, 2026, the streaming service will be the exclusive home of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) events in the United States and Latin America. Now, instead of paying to watch each bout on pay-per-view television, UFC devotees can \n\nThe new arrangement comes after TKO Group Holdings, UFC’s parent company, announced a $7.7 billion deal with Paramount, a Skydance corporation, this August. That deal, which will run through 2033, “will unlock greater accessibility and discoverability for sports fans and provide an important catalyst for driving engagement and further subscriber growth for Paramount+,” according to a press release.\n\nFans will no longer need to use pay-per-view to watch UFC bouts. Starting January 24, Paramount+ subscribers will be able to watch UFC’s full slate of 13 marquee numbered events and all 30 of UFC’s 2026 Fight Night events on the streaming service, with no extra charge on top of their Paramount+ subscriptions, as the service explains. Plus, select marquee fights will be simulcast on CBS under the new deal.\n\nParamount+ offers two plans: an ad-supported Essential plan and an ad-free Premium plan. Starting January 15, the Essential plan will cost $9 per month or $90 per year, while the Essentials plan will cost $14 per month or $140 per year, per CNET. Those prices are more expensive than they were in 2025 but still represent a bargain for UFC fans, considering UFC’s pay-per-view model with ESPN cost viewers $79.99 per event last year, according to SB Nation.\n\nIn a press release about the streaming deal, UFC hyped up its UFC 324 event, which will officially kick off the organization’s Paramount+ era on Saturday, January 2024. UFC 324 will be headlined by two marquee showdowns, one in which UFC lightweight champion and former BMF titleholder Justin Gaethje faces Paddy “The Baddy” Pimblett in an interim UFC lightweight title fight. In the other, UFC women’s bantamweight champion Kayla Harrison fights UFC Hall of Famer Amanda Nunes, who is returning to the Octagon for the first time since 2023.\n\nAs of December 18, Paramount+’s UFC 2026 schedule showed the following events (with a disclaimer that all fight cards, dates, and times are subject to change):\n\nSaturday, January 24, 2026 — UFC 324: Gaethje vs. Pimblett\n T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas, Nevada\n Early prelims: 5/4c\n Prelims: 7/6c\n Main card: 9/8c\n\nSaturday, January 31, 2026 — UFC 325: Volkanovski vs. Lopes 2\n Qudos Bank Arena, Sydney Olympic Park NSW, Australia\n Early prelims: 5/4c\n Prelims: 7/6c\n Main card: 9/8c\n\nSaturday, February 7, 2026 — UFC Fight Night: Bautista vs. Oliveira \n UFC Apex, Las Vegas, Nevada\n Prelims: 6/5c\n Main card: 9/8c\n\nSaturday, February 21, 2026 — UFC Fight Night: Strickland vs. Hernandez \n Toyota Center, Houston, Texas\n Prelims: 6/5c\n Main card: 9/8c\n\nSaturday, February 28, 2026 — UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Almabayev \n Arena CDMX, Mexico City, Mexico\n Prelims: 6/5c\n Main card: 9/8c\n\nSaturday, March 7, 2026 — UFC 326: Holloway vs. Oliveira 2 \n T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas, Nevada\n Early prelims: TBA\n Prelims: TBA\n Main card: TBA\n\nSaturday, March 14, 2026 — UFC Fight Night\n UFC Apex, Las Vegas, Nevada\n Prelims: TBA\n Main card: TBA\n\nSaturday, March 21, 2026 — UFC Fight Night\n The O2, London, England\n Prelims: TBA\n Main card: TBA\n\nSaturday, March 28, 2026 — UFC Fight Night\n Climate Pledge Arena, Seattle, Washington\n Prelims: TBA\n Main card: TBA\n\nUFC 324: Gaethje vs. Pimblett, Streaming, Sunday, January 24, 9/8c, Paramount+\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "description": "Remote work policies are changing at many large companies, including NBCUniversal and Paramount. Here's which media giants still allow remote work.",
    "fullText": "It was a year of RTO mandates in the media industry.\n\nThose issuing new guidance included media giants like NBCUniversal and Paramount Skydance, which this fall told thousands of employees to prepare to work in person four or five days a week in early 2026.\n\nWork-from-home policies haven't gone extinct at Netflix or its acquisition target, Warner Bros. Discovery, however. YouTube also has a flexible approach to remote work.\n\nHere's the latest on work-from-home and return-to-office policies at six major media and tech companies heading into 2026.\n\nParamount announced this year that it would be calling thousands of employees back to its New York and Los Angeles offices to work in-person five days a week starting January 5, 2026. The decision came in early September, less than a month after CEO David Ellison took charge after the Paramount-Skydance merger.\n\nStaffers who weren't up for in-person work were offered a severance package, which about 600 employees took, Paramount said in its third-quarter shareholder letter in mid-November.\n\nSome Paramount staff members can continue to work from home for now, including those based outside the US and those who were hired for fully remote roles. These employees who aren't assigned to the NY or LA offices will hear about \"Phase Two\" of Paramount's return-to-office plan in 2026, Ellison told employees in his September memo.\n\nParamount has been preparing its offices in NY and LA for an influx of remote workers by having employees in those areas work from home throughout December.\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal followed in Paramount's footsteps, telling employees to report to its office four days per week starting January 5, 2026. NBCU staffers can still work from home on Fridays.\n\n\"In-person work and collaboration spark innovation, promote creativity, and build stronger connections,\" NBCU operating chief Adam Miller said in a memo to staffers about the change.\n\nNBCU also gave a severance offer to employees who weren't willing to return to the office. Notably, this exit package was one-size-fits-all, meaning that it wasn't dependent on how long staffers had worked for the parent of Peacock and Universal Studios.\n\nDisney's return-to-office edict came nearly three years ago in early 2023, when CEO Bob Iger called most Mouse House staffers back to the office four days a week.\n\n\"It is my belief that working together more in-person will benefit the company's creativity, culture, and our employees' careers,\" Iger told employees at the time.\n\nHowever, Disney's remote work policy isn't always enforced equally. Some staffers have told Business Insider that their managers strictly enforce the four-day rule, while others have said that their bosses are more lax about badge swipes.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery requires most of its employees to work in person three days a week, with a work-from-home option on the other two days.\n\nHowever, that policy could change if the company behind HBO and Warner Bros. Studios were bought by either Netflix or Paramount Skydance.\n\nYouTube-parent Google's remote work policy may be confusing, but it offers a certain level of flexibility.\n\nThe tech giant's remote work policy lets employees work from home two days a week. It also offers a \"Work From Anywhere\" program, allowing staff members to telecommute for four weeks a year.\n\nGoogle revised that \"Work From Anywhere\" policy this fall, CNBC reported, citing an internal memo telling employees that using one so-called \"WFA\" day in a week would count as using an entire week. That's because these \"WFA\" weeks are intended for use when employees work away from their homes or worksites, and not as a substitute for a work-from-home or paid-time-off day.\n\n\"The policy was always intended to be taken in increments of a week and not be used as a substitute for working from home in a regular hybrid workweek,\" John Casey, Google's VP of performance and rewards, said of the change in a call with employees, CNBC reported.\n\nNetflix hasn't set a companywide work-site policy, meaning that employees can be fully remote, work in the office every day, or anywhere in between.\n\nEmployees' working locations can vary by team and position, which a Netflix spokesperson said gives teams \"the information and freedom to make decisions that best suit their type of work.\"\n\nThat relaxed remote work policy has long been common among tech companies, though that's starting to shift — even at video-conference giant Zoom.",

    "description": "A Paramount manager had 11 days to decide: return to the office five days a week — or take severance. He explains why he chose to walk away.",
    "fullText": "In September, Ron Telemarque was given 11 days to make a difficult decision: leave his job at Paramount Skydance — or prepare to work from the office five days a week. He's confident he made the right choice.\n\nFor the first half of this year, Telemarque commuted to the office two days a week in his role as senior manager of deal finance strategy. When management changes tied to the company's merger bumped that up to three days for his team starting in September, Telemarque and his wife began preparing a childcare plan for their four-year-old daughter on the days he'd have to make the 90-minute, one-way commute.\n\nBut on September 4, their plans were scrambled. David Ellison, who became CEO in August following the merger's closing, issued an ultimatum to most employees: return to the office five days a week starting in January, or accept a severance package by September 15.\n\n\"They dropped the bomb: 'Hey, it's five days a week — take it or leave it,'\" Telemarque said.\n\nOver the past year, Business Insider has spoken with more than a dozen workers like Telemarque who have been affected by return-to-office mandates. Several large employers — including Amazon, JPMorgan, AT&T, and Microsoft — have rolled back remote work policies, prompting some employees to reconsider where they live, how they manage childcare, and whether to stay in their jobs.\n\nWhile some workers are happy to return to the office for camaraderie and a change of scenery, others have requested flexibility from their managers or parted ways with their employers. At Paramount, about 600 employees accepted severance packages after the company announced its new five-day office policy. In the September 4 memo to employees, Ellison said that \"in-person collaboration is absolutely vital to building and strengthening our culture and driving the success of our business.\"\n\nTelemarque shared the personal and professional factors he weighed when deciding whether to stay at Paramount — and how he feels about that choice months later.\n\nWhen Telemarque joined Paramount, then called ViacomCBS, in 2021, he worked remotely with the understanding that he'd eventually be required to follow a hybrid schedule. This ultimately meant commuting to the company's Manhattan office two days a week, starting in early 2022.\n\nTelemarque said the two-day commute from Stamford, where he and his wife began renting in 2020, included a 20-minute walk to the train station, a 45- to 50-minute train ride, and another 20-minute walk from Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nHe said the commute was manageable from both a personal and childcare standpoint for him and his wife, who works remotely as a full-time marketing director. Telemarque would drop off their daughter at preschool and handle other childcare duties on Mondays and Fridays, while his wife covered those responsibilities on the days he commuted.\n\n\"With that kind of work style, I could do it because my commute, though long, still felt doable,\" said the 41-year-old.\n\nHowever, Telemarque wasn't sure he could manage a five-day commute. It was a question he was forced to confront in early September, when he learned he had 11 days to decide whether to accept a severance package — which, for him, included two months of pay — or prepare for a full-time return to the office in January.\n\nOne major consideration was how a five-day commute would affect the time he spent with his daughter, whom he already saw less in the mornings and evenings on the days he commuted. He added that his job sometimes required evening work, but the ability to work from home had made those days more manageable. Under the new policy, he figured he'd likely be spending more of those late hours in the office — and away from his daughter.\n\n\"For me to be at the office, that means I'm going to get up early, probably not see my kid, and then when I come back, they're probably in bed,\" he said.\n\nAnother consideration was how the new schedule would affect his wife, who would have to take on more childcare responsibilities. While her ability to work remotely provided some flexibility, Telemarque said there's a chance she could also eventually face a return-to-office mandate.\n\nThere was also the question of whether they'd be willing to move closer to Manhattan to shorten his commute — a decision that could mean breaking their lease before it ended the following August, finding a new home, and enrolling their daughter in a new school.\n\nAs Telemarque weighed his options, he said it felt like the September 15 decision deadline was approaching fast. He struggled to get comfortable with the lifestyle adjustments a five-day commute would require — and how he and his wife could make it work.\n\nBeyond the logistics, Telemarque said he also felt uneasy about the direction Paramount was heading under its new leadership. He found it somewhat frustrating that he had performed well enough to earn a promotion in a hybrid environment — yet couldn't retain that flexibility under the company's new expectations.\n\nUltimately, he decided to take the severance package and leave the company.\n\n\"I didn't have enough time,\" he said. \"So my best bet was to take the package.\"\n\nTelemarque said he worked through the end of October before officially parting ways with the company and turning his attention to finding his next role.\n\nOver the last few months, Telemarque has been targeting roles related to strategy, finance, and distribution within the media and entertainment industry. He said he's focused on remote and hybrid roles, but would be open to a fully in-office position if the commute was short enough and the compensation made it worthwhile.\n\nTelemarque said he's still looking for an offer and that he's feeling some financial pressure to find work.\n\n\"It's stressful having to network and trying to get a job,\" he said.\n\nBut even as his search continues, Telemarque still feels leaving Paramount was the right choice.\n\n\"I feel good about my decision, but the predicament I was in was unfortunate,\" he said. \"If I had had a better option, would I have made it? Yes. But that was the best outcome.\"",

    "description": "Warner Bros. is in the middle of a tug-of-war between Netflix and David Ellison’s company, Paramount Skydance.",
    "fullText": "Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison is raising the stakes in the battle for Hollywood’s future, personally intervening to salvage his son David Ellison’s hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. On Monday, David’s company, Paramount Skydance, announced the elder Ellison had provided an “irrevocable personal guarantee” of $40.4 billion to finance the deal, directly countering claims that the company’s funding was unreliable.​\n\nIt’s the latest turn in the high-profile tug-of-war for Warner Bros. Discovery, one of the entertainment industry’s crown jewels. David Ellison, who became CEO of the newly merged Paramount Skydance in August, has been aggressively pursuing Warner Bros. with a $108 billion all-cash offer, which comes out to about $30 per share. However, WBD’s board rejected that proposal in favor of a rival agreement to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix for roughly $83 billion.​\n\nThe board’s rejection hinged largely on skepticism regarding the Ellison family’s financing. Last week, WBD directors dismissed Paramount’s funding as “illusory,” citing concerns that the capital was tied to a “revocable family trust” that could be altered or withdrawn before the deal closed. Larry Ellison’s Monday filing was designed to silence those doubts.\n\n“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” the company said in a statement, adding that the tech tycoon has agreed “not to revoke the Ellison family trust (which has been operating for nearly 40 years as a counterparty to numerous transactions) or adversely transfer its assets during the pendency of the transaction.”​\n\nThis massive personal commitment—roughly one-sixth of Larry Ellison’s $247.3 billion estimated net worth—effectively removes the WBD board’s primary defense against the takeover. To further sweeten the pot, Paramount raised its proposed breakup fee to $5.8 billion, matching the termination fee included in the rival Netflix offer.​\n\nDavid Ellison argued that his company’s bid remains the only path that preserves Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole entity, rather than selling it off in parts. Netflix’s planned acquisition would exclude WBD’s Global Networks division, which includes CNN and other cable-native brands, and which WBD had previously announced plans to spin off.\n\n“Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on Dec. 4th, and continues to be the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders,” David Ellison said in a statement Monday. “We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”​",

    "title": "The 6 biggest reveals from WBD's filing on why it rejected Paramount",
    "description": "A new filing says Paramount offered pay and a job to WBD CEO David Zaslav, and gives other takeaways from the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery didn't just reject Paramount again on Wednesday. It also pulled back the curtain on what the bidding war was like behind the scenes.\n\nWBD advised shareholders to dismiss Paramount's $30-per-share offer for the company and stick with Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share (for only its studios and streaming business). In a filing, WBD's board called Paramount's latest bid inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on shareholders compared to Netflix's bid, which it said offered superior value and more certainty.\n\nSome of the information in the filing had already been made public, but it revealed some juicy bits that haven't been reported.\n\nHere are the top six takeaways:\n\nRight after WBD rejected one of multiple secret bids in September, David Ellison called Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav to request that Zaslav meet with his father, Larry Ellison. The conventional wisdom was that the Oracle cofounder's billions would prevail. In the end, that didn't happen. WBD expressed concern that the bid relied on a revocable trust, whose assets or liabilities were subject to change.\n\nWe already knew Zaslav stood to make over $500 million from a Paramount deal, based mainly on his shares that would vest immediately after it closed ($567,712,631, to be exact, according to the filing). Zaslav told the WBD board that the Ellisons had \"indicated to him that\" if a deal went through, he would \"receive a compensation package worth several hundred million dollars,\" per the filing. Zaslav responded that it \"would be inappropriate to discuss any such arrangements at that time,\" he told the board.\n\nParamount also offered Zaslav the position of co-CEO and co-chairman of the combined company, a role Netflix didn't offer, the filing said.\n\nThat runs contrary to the narrative put forth in a letter Paramount's attorneys at Quinn Emanuel sent to WBD, stating they suspected the process was biased in favor of Netflix due to WBD leadership's expectations that there could be roles for them at the new company. Paramount's legal and financial advisors didn't know about the \"December 3 Quinn Emanuel\" letter and, in their view, the letter should not have been sent, was \"not helpful,\" and was a \"mistake,\" the filing says.\n\nThe filing revealed the presence of a fourth, previously unknown bidder in the process, \"Company C,\" which proposed acquiring WBD's cable channels and 20% of its streaming and studio businesses for $25 billion in cash.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Company C was Starz. Business Insider was unable to independently confirm that. Starz declined to comment.\n\nWBD determined that the Company C bid was \"not actionable\" and continued to work with Netflix, Paramount, and \"Company A\" (clearly Comcast).\n\nSome of Wall Street's marquee names — Allen & Co., J.P. Morgan, and Evercore — are set to make a total of $225 million in connection with WBD's sale to Netflix or Paramount, if a deal goes through, according to the filing.\n\nThe good times are poised to continue: Media and telecoms M&A deal value rose 61% in the past year, excluding the announced WBD sale, and the momentum should keep going in the years ahead, helped by investor appetite for valuable IP, according to PwC.\n\nThe Ellisons wanted to use $24 billion from Middle Eastern sources to fund their bid. That would seem to raise a whole host of concerns, not the least of which is that they'd be buying CNN and some of that money would come from Saudi Arabia's government, which US intelligence said killed a Washington Post journalist in 2018.\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka noted, however, that the issues WBD says the foreign money raised were \"presented as technical hurdles\" in the filing and \"not moral or patriotic dealbreakers.\"\n\nA big question around the dueling bids was which company would have a better chance of surviving regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBoth Paramount and Netflix made their cases, arguing that they'd sail through the process, while the other bidder would encounter issues.\n\nParamount said a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal would harm consumers and Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the well-stocked Warner Bros. library. Netflix, for its part, has argued that a combination of Paramount and WBD would actually be larger than its own proposed new entity, as measured by total US TV viewing time.\n\nNone of this seemed to be a chief concern for the WBD board, though.\n\n\"The WBD Board further took into account advice of WBD's regulatory advisors that regulatory risk was not a material differentiating factor between\" the Paramount and Netflix proposals, the filing said.\n\nThe wild card is Trump, though, who has close ties to the Ellisons but hasn't come down firmly on either side publicly.",

    "description": "You might think the notion of Saudi money owning part of an American media giant would kill a deal. That's not why it's failed so far.",
    "fullText": "Larry and David Ellison, who own Paramount, want to use $24 billion in Middle Eastern money to finance their bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. Is that a problem for WBD?\n\nYou might think so — especially since $10 billion of that came from the Saudi government. That's the same government that US intelligence said killed a Washington Post journalist in 2018. The kind of partner you might think a major American media conglomerate would want to keep at arm's length.\n\nBut that's not a problem WBD raises in its newest communication to shareholders, where it urges them to take the deal offered by Netflix instead.\n\nWhat actually worries WBD about the Ellisons' bid isn't the Ellisons' particular partners. It's that the Ellisons had partners.\n\nIn a regulatory filing that tells the backstory of the proposed WBD sale, WBD execs and their reps repeatedly told the Ellisons they wanted a firm commitment that Larry Ellison — currently the world's 5th-richest man, with an estimated net worth of $243 billion — would guarantee the deal himself.\n\nInstead, WBD argues, the Ellisons never gave them the assurances they wanted.\n\nThe filing does bring up the fact that money from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds would likely complicate regulatory issues for a proposed Ellison/Paramount deal. (Ditto for a proposed $1 billion investment from China's Tencent, which the Ellisons later took out of their proposal.) But those are presented as technical hurdles. Not moral or patriotic dealbreakers.\n\nAnd they're just part of a laundry list of complaints WBD makes about the Ellisons. Among them: A December 2 tweet from New York Post reporter Charlie Gasparino, which WBD said violated a confidentiality agreement Paramount had signed.\n\nAnd when it comes to the main pitch WBD is making to investors, all of that stuff disappears. It just boils down to \"we did our homework, and the Netflix deal is better.\"\n\nThat's not shocking: If you're a WBD investor, you are (supposedly) only interested in getting the maximum value for shares. And WBD's filing argues that Netflix is the one that can pay the most.\n\nNow we're waiting to see what the Ellisons do next: Many observers believe they'll return with yet another, higher bid. Will this one have Gulf money, too?",

    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount Skydance and CEO David Ellison again. Read WBD's full letter to shareholders.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery still isn't interested in Paramount Skydance's offer.\n\nParamount's latest bid \"is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders\" compared to Netflix's bid, which \"represents superior, more certain value for our shareholders,\" said Samuel Di Piazza, the chair of WBD's board of directors, in a statement to shareholders on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, WBD's board recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's all-cash bid of $30 per share in favor of Netflix's cash-and-stock offer. Paramount wants to buy all of WBD, including its cable channels, while Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share is for WBD's studio, HBO, and HBO Max. A key difference between the two bids revolves around the value of WBD's TV networks, such as CNN and TNT, which Netflix isn't interested in buying.\n\nDi Piazza said that Paramount's seventh proposal \"once again fails to address key concerns that we have consistently communicated,\" including about Paramount's financing.\n\nParamount has said its bid is fully backstopped by Larry Ellison, one of the richest people in the world and father to Paramount CEO David Ellison. The WBD board said in the letter to shareholders that it relies \"on an unknown and opaque revocable trust\" whose assets or liabilities are subject to change.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix is paying with cash and stock. Its shares have fallen recently but surged more than 600% from mid-2022 to mid-2025. Netflix has a market cap of over $400 billion.\n\nWhile Paramount has said that it would have an easier time securing regulatory approval than Netflix, the WBD board says it \"does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk\" between the two proposals.\n\nThe Ellisons are close to President Donald Trump. However, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has pitched the president on the deal and seems to have earned some respect. Trump has called Sarandos a \"great person,\" though he added that the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal \"could be a problem\" on the regulatory front. Still, the president hasn't come out publicly in favor of one side in the deal.\n\nWBD also said its board \"repeatedly engaged\" with interested parties, including the Ellisons. Paramount had previously said that WBD went quiet late in the bidding process.\n\nNot even Paramount can be surprised by WBD's decision to stick with its Netflix deal.\n\nDavid Ellison was overheard saying last week that if WBD's leadership were to \"accept the offer exactly as it is today, right, then they're admitting breach of fiduciary duty,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThat's because Paramount said its $30-per-share hostile bid was nearly identical to its previous offer to WBD. Public companies are obligated to act in the best interests of shareholders. So if WBD's board had changed its mind, it could have opened itself up to shareholder lawsuits.\n\nWBD had said in a statement after Paramount's hostile bid that it would \"carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer\" in a way that was \"consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors.\"\n\nNow that WBD's board has given Paramount the cold shoulder again, it's Ellison's move.\n\nThe aspiring media mogul told CEO David Zaslav that Paramount's latest offer wasn't its \"best and final,\" which suggests that a higher bid could be coming. Just how much appetite Paramount has to escalate the bidding war is the key question.\n\nIf no higher bid comes, WBD's investors have until January 8 to back Paramount, though it could extend that deadline. WBD would owe Netflix a $2.8 billion reverse breakup fee if its shareholders chose Paramount.\n\nRead the full letter to shareholders here:\n\nAs your Board of Directors, we are committed to acting in your best interest. In this spirit, in October, we launched a public review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. This followed three separate proposals from Paramount Skydance (\"PSKY\"), as well as interest from multiple other parties.\n\nThat thorough process, overseen by the Board with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, as well as our management team, led to the company entering into a merger agreement with Netflix on December 4, with the substantial benefits to WBD shareholders described below. Having failed to submit the best proposal for you, our shareholders, PSKY launched an offer nearly identical to its most recently rejected proposal.\n\nAs a Board, we have now conducted another review and determined that PSKY's tender offer remains inferior to the Netflix merger. The Board continues to unanimously recommend the Netflix merger, and that you reject the PSKY offer and not tender your shares.\n\nBelow, and in more detail in our 14D-9 filing, we highlight the many reasons for the Board's determination. None of these reasons will be a surprise to PSKY given our clear, and oft-repeated, feedback on their six prior proposals.\n\nThe terms of the Netflix merger are superior. The PSKY offer provides inadequate value and imposes numerous, significant risks and costs on WBD.\n\nThe value we have secured for shareholders through the Netflix merger is extraordinary by any measure.\n\nOur agreement with Netflix gives WBD shareholders $23.25 in cash, plus $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock (based on a collar range of $97.91 - $119.67 in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing), plus the additional value of the shares of Discovery Global and the opportunity to participate in future potential upside following Discovery Global's separation from WBD. The entire Board is confident in our recommendation that Netflix represents the best value-creating path for shareholders.\n\nPSKY has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a \"full backstop\" from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has.\n\nPSKY's most recent proposal includes a $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind. Instead, they propose that you rely on an unknown and opaque revocable trust for the certainty of this crucial deal funding. Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was — and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming — the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer.\n\nAnd a revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling stockholder. The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change. As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time. And the documents provided by PSKY for this conditional commitment contain gaps, loopholes and limitations that put you, our shareholders, and our company at risk.\n\nAmplifying the concerns about the credibility of the equity commitment being offered by PSKY, the revocable trust and PSKY have agreed that the trust's liability for damages, even in the case of a willful breach, would be capped at 7% of its commitment ($2.8 billion on a $108.4 billion transaction). Of course, the damage to WBD and its stockholders were the trust or PSKY to breach their obligations to close a transaction would likely be many multiples of this amount.\n\nWBD's merger agreement with Netflix is a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments. The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet. The debt financing for the PSKY bid relies on an unsecure revocable trust commitment as well as the credit worthiness of a $15 billion market cap company with a credit rating at or only a notch above \"junk\" status from the two leading rating agencies. The financial condition and creditworthiness of PSKY, which, if its proposed transaction were to close, would have a high gross leverage ratio of 6.8x 2026E debt to EBITDA with virtually no current free cash flow generation before synergies, raise substantial risks for its acquisition of WBD. Such debt levels reflect a risky capital structure that is vulnerable to even potentially small changes in the PSKY or WBD business between signing and closing.\n\nAdditionally, PSKY contemplates $9 billion in synergies from the mergers of Paramount/Skydance and their offer for WBD. These targets are both ambitious from an operational perspective and would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.\n\nThe Board's review was full, transparent and comprehensive — establishing a level playing field that fostered a rigorous and fair process.\n\nThe Board repeatedly engaged with all parties, including extensive engagement with PSKY and its advisors over the course of nearly three months. We held dozens of calls and meetings with its principals and advisors including four in-person meetings and meals between David Zaslav and David and/or Larry Ellison and provided multiple opportunities for PSKY to offer a proposal that was superior to those of the other bidders, which PSKY never did.\n\nAfter each bid, we informed PSKY of the material deficiencies and offered potential solutions. Despite this feedback, PSKY has never submitted a proposal that is superior to the Netflix merger agreement.\n\nDespite PSKY's media statements to the contrary, the Board does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk between the PSKY offer and the Netflix merger.\n\nThe Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the PSKY offer with its regulatory advisors. The Board believes that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material. The Board also notes that Netflix has agreed to a record-setting regulatory termination cash fee of $5.8 billion, significantly higher than PSKY's $5 billion break fee.\n\nThe offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time prior to its completion; it is not the same thing as a binding merger agreement. The first paragraph of the offer states it is \"subject to the conditions set forth in this offer to purchase (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time)\" and continues on the next page, \"we reserve the right to amend the Offer in any respect (including amending the Offer Price)\". In addition, the offer is not capable of being completed by its current expiration date, due to the need for, among other things, global regulatory approvals, which PSKY indicates may take 12-18 months. Nothing in this structure offers WBD shareholders any deal certainty.\n\nThe PSKY offer provides an untenable degree of risk and potential downside for WBD shareholders.\n\nThere will be additional costs associated with PSKY's offer that could impact shareholders.\n\nWhen considering the PSKY offer at this juncture, it is important to note that its acceptance could incur significant additional costs to shareholders — all of which PSKY has ignored in their communications. WBD would have to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee, which PSKY has not offered to reimburse. In addition, WBD would incur approximately $1.5 billion in financing costs if we do not complete our planned debt exchange as agreed to with certain of our debtholders, which would not be permitted by the PSKY offer. This additional $4.3 billion in potential costs represents approximately $1.66 per share to be borne by WBD shareholders if the offer does not close.\n\nWe look forward to moving ahead with our combination with Netflix and delivering the compelling and certain value it will create for shareholders. We urge you to carefully read the 14D-9 filed with the SEC this morning and available on our website, which more fully details the strategic review process and the Board's reasons for its recommendation to you.\n\nThe Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors",

The result could be the M&A world’s version of a big-budget Hollywood fiasco, with Paramount’s expenses spiraling beyond what it planned if debt markets sour and funding costs surge.",

    "description": "A movie based on Activision's Call of Duty series is in the works now at Paramount, which is now led by billionaire and Call of Duty superfan David Ellison. Prolific writer and director Taylor Sheridan is writing the script for the film, with Lone Survivor director Peter Berg attached to direct.\nActivision had been trying to make Call of Duty movies for years, so why is it finally happening now? Xbox boss Matt Booty told Variety that \"a relationship came about\" between people at Paramount and senior executives working on Call of Duty. \"They felt like they found a partner who understands the game, people who play the game, and shared a vision of what it could be to bring that forward,\" Booty said.",

But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid for WBD, for $30 per share.\n\nIn the letter, Ellison also slammed WBD's advisors for not giving equal weight to Paramount's offer, compared to Netflix's, and described the sales process as being \"opaque.\"\n\n\"To suggest that we are not 'good for the money' (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd,\" he said.\n\nHe said that WBD advisors \"never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers.\"\n\nEllison added that WBD did not grant Paramount a \"single 'real time' negotiating session,\" and had \"sprinted towards a deal with Netflix.\" He said WDB ignored texts from him and his advisors in which they said their $30-per-share offer was not their best and final one.\n\nRepresentatives for WBD did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about Ellison's accusations in the letter.\n\nAfter Paramount launched the hostile bid, Ellison pitched the deal to his own staff in an internal memo on Monday, as seen by Business Insider. He told his staff that the combination of Paramount and WBD would be a \"powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that Ellison said at a Tuesday UBS event that he knew why WBD could not accept his latest offer.\n\n\"If they accept the offer exactly as it is today, right, then they're admitting breach of fiduciary duty, so I don't think they can just take that,\" Ellison said.\n\nThe bid is partially financed by the wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe media war has not escaped the notice of President Donald Trump, who said he would be involved in the deal. He said on Sunday that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"",

    "fullText": "The Hollywood bidding war between Paramount Skydance and Netflix has created a meme frenzy.\n\nThe two media giants are in an all-out battle for Warner Bros. Discovery after it accepted Netflix's offer to acquire its studio and streaming businesses for an equity value of $72 billion. David Ellison's Paramount launched a hostile $30-per-share bid for all of WBD on Monday.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery owns the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, the HBO Max streaming service, and TV networks such as CNN, TNT, and TruTV. It confirmed receipt of Paramount's unsolicited offer on Monday.\n\nBoth entities have made their cases on why they'd be the best owner for WBD. Although internet comedians don't have a say in where the deals land, it hasn't stopped them from weighing in with viral jokes about the dueling companies and their quest to acquire WBD.\n\nSome social media users are poking fun at the back-and-forth with memes about how far each company is willing to go to gain WBD's favor. One post compared the battle for the best offer to a scene from the HBO business drama \"Succession,\" a title Netflix would own if the deal goes through.\n\nA post shared by Karl Smith, CFA (L1 Candidate) (@wallstreetintern)\n\nThe Instagram meme account Litquidity used parody images that appeared to be AI-created of two business leaders speaking at the DealBook Summit to mock how each company is trying to prove its offer is better.\n\nNetflix and Paramount trying to show off why their Warner Bros acquisition offers are better pic.twitter.com/mjpP7sjAnA\n\nSome people seem to be using humor to cope with the idea of more consolidation in Hollywood. They are pushing back on both offers with memes about stopping the looming acquisition completely.\n\nChristopher Nolan, James Cameron, and Steven Spielberg on their way to stop Netflix from buying Warner Bros: pic.twitter.com/pnCAU4kclM\n\n\"I'm putting together a team to fight the Netflix Warner Bros merger,\" one X user captioned a compilation video of various actors and famous filmmakers.\n\nI’m putting together a team to fight the Netflix Warner Bros merger: pic.twitter.com/wl26YfGCjg\n\nOthers speculated on what the movie-watching experience could be like under Warner Bros. Discovery's new ownership. One TikTok video showed a man sitting down to watch a movie, only for the intros to include a confusing mix of studios, backers such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and even a DJ, being played before the movie began.\n\nevery company is every company #business#news #netflix\n\nIn the midst of all the jokes, Netflix argues that its offer would be better for consumers and creators, while Ellison says Paramount is more likely to win regulatory approval and offers Hollywood more certainty.\n\nWhat all of this means in the long run is unclear so far. It could lead to job cuts in the entertainment industry as the giants consolidate their power. The trends of streaming services getting pricier and fewer movies hitting theaters could also continue, as companies release less content, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nEither way — as with many serious big business deals — consumers and industry insiders are finding ways to laugh through it.",

    "description": "Paramount's David Ellison wants to buy all of Warner, including its cable networks. How much they're worth is a big part of his fight vs. Netflix.",
    "fullText": "The fight between Paramount and Netflix over Warner Bros. Discovery is ultimately about who gets to control HBO and the Warner movie studio.\n\nBut the way that fight gets settled is going to involve an unusual side quest: CNN, TNT, the Food Network, and a bunch of other cable networks WBD wants to get rid of. Specifically: What are all of those shrinking cable networks worth?\n\nWhich leads us to a pretty weird place: Paramount CEO David Ellison, who wants to buy all of WBD — including its cable networks — is arguing that those cable networks aren't worth very much at all. And Netflix, which doesn't want to buy those cable networks, is implicitly arguing that they're worth much more.\n\nThat's because in the Netflix scenario, current WBD shareholders would go through two transactions: First, WBD would spin out its cable networks into a new company, and WBD investors would be given shares in that new company. Then Netflix would buy the remainder of WBD — HBO and the studio — for cash and stock.\n\nWhich means Netflix, and WBD executives who have blessed the Netflix offer, will want investors to think the cable networks are valuable. Ellison wants them to think the opposite.\n\n\"The lower you value the cable assets, the greater advantage Paramount's bid has. If shareholders believe the cable operations are more highly valued, then Netflix's bid, which assumes they will be spun off, means investors get an overall bigger sum of money.\"\n\nAnd here's the actual gap: Ellison says the spin-off is worth about $1 per WBD share — or roughly $2.5 billion, based on WBD's current valuation. Independent analysts think it might be closer to $4 per share — or roughly $10 billion. Paramount and Netflix reps declined to comment; WBD hasn't responded to my request.\n\nSo one side is describing a rounding error, especially when it's part of a deal that could be worth $108 billion. The other is describing, more or less, a midsize media company.\n\nAnd yes, this is equity value, not enterprise value — this already assumes the spin-off gets saddled with billions of WBD's debt under the Netflix plan. But we're going to focus this conversation on the shares that ultimately end up in a WBD investor's brokerage account.\n\nAnd if you believe David Ellison and Co., those investors aren't getting much. Because CNN, Turner, and all of the networks formerly owned by Discovery aren't worth much at all.\n\nAnd yes, the cable network industry is a falling knife, which is why many big media companies that own cable networks are trying to ditch them. But are things really that bad?\n\nMaybe. Maybe, using Ellison's math, all of CNN plus a pile of other cable networks — which still generate cash, mind you — are worth about 16 Bari Weisses, based on the reported $150 million he paid for her Free Press site.\n\nOr maybe all of that is worth $10 billion — which means it's still less than 1% of Google. Which feels like a metaphor for the entire media industry in 2025: Even a roomful of famous brands barely registers in a world run by giant software companies.\n\nSomewhere in that $2.5 billion to $10 billion range is the real answer. But the headline is clear: The networks that once held the entire cable bundle together are now garage sale leftovers. Worth something to someone — but a whole lot less than they used to be.",

    "description": "Former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer predicts \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros. between Netflix and Paramount.",
    "fullText": "A former Disney executive who oversaw its dealmaking expects \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer\" from Netflix, Paramount Skydance, or both, said Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, on Tuesday at the UBS media conference.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion, including debt. Paramount Skydance then launched a hostile offer, saying on Monday that it's willing to pay $108.4 billion for the whole firm, including the TV networks like CNN and HGTV. Executives at Netflix and Paramount CEO David Ellison have each framed their offers as the best for employees, Hollywood, WBD shareholders, and TV viewers. Both suitors also said they're confident they can pass regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMayer, now the co-CEO of Cocomelon owner Candle Media, said he thinks Paramount's hostile bid will reignite the faceoff for Warner Bros. and force the eventual winner to fork over more money.\n\n\"From the Warner Bros. Discovery perspective, this is nothing but good news,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer added: \"Does it move up another $5 billion or $10 billion? I think it probably does. That's what it's going to take to win it.\"\n\nMayer said the battle for Warner Bros. reminds him of the fight for control of 21st Century Fox between Disney and Comcast, which he was involved in during his tenure at the Mouse House.\n\nUnder Mayer, Disney agreed to buy Fox's studio, FX, and its stake in Hulu for $52.4 billion in equity, or $66.1 billion with debt, in December 2017. Six months later, cable giant Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash offer for those same assets. Disney ultimately won, but it was forced to pay a heftier price of $71.3 billion. Mayer helped engineer Disney's initial agreement with Fox, but had moved to a role atop Disney's streaming business by the time the acquisition closed.\n\n\"That was a difficult process,\" Mayer said of Comcast's bid for Fox. \"It added $19 billion to the price tag. Still a good deal, but not the exceptional deal that it was before we had to pay more.\"\n\nWhile Disney's deal with Fox gave it control over Hulu and bolstered its library, Disney activist investor Nelson Peltz argued that the Mouse House had shown \"poor judgment\" by \"overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets.\"\n\nAs Netflix and Paramount vie for Warner Bros., Mayer said the Disney-Comcast showdown \"points to where we might see this going.\"\n\nThat's because Ellison's $30-per-share hostile bid, which Paramount also sent to WBD's board, might not be rich enough, Mayer said.\n\n\"David Ellison has already kind of hinted at that, that he hasn't done his best and final yet, and I suspect he hasn't,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer was likely referencing a text message from Ellison to WBD CEO David Zaslav, which was made public as part of a Paramount filing on Monday: \"Please note importantly we did not include 'best and final' in our bid.\"\n\n\"The team at Paramount is aggressive,\" Mayer said. He pointed to the gargantuan amount of money that David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry, have at their disposal.\n\n\"I don't think there's a whole lot of hesitancy to spend it,\" Mayer said.",

    "description": "The fight between Netflix and Paramount over who will buy Warner Bros. is heating up. Here's what markets are thinking about the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "A bidding war has broken out over one of America's most iconic media companies, and investors in the three firms involved are mixed on the prospect of where it'll all shake out.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery have climbed on the back of a hostile bid from Paramount Skydance to acquire the film and television company, but they're still slightly below the competing bid from Netflix, which was announced as the winner of the sale process last Friday.\n\nParamount on Monday made an all-cash offer worth $30 a share to acquire Warner Bros. and its film studio and streaming services.\n\nIt's unclear which way Warner Bros. will go. The company's board of directors said on Monday that it wasn't changing its recommendation regarding its agreement with Netflix, but would review Paramount's offer over the next two weeks. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nMarkets, though, are flashing some clues about what investors think might happen next. Here's what to watch.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery rose to $27.70 on Tuesday, just below Netflix's offer of $27.75 a share.\n\nIf the stock were to surpass that level, that could be a sign investors expect Warner Bros. to go with Paramount's offer, or that they expect Netflix to put together a better offer, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I would say that there's a combination of both of those things probably in play right now,\" Hogan said of investors pricing in both scenarios, though he noted that trading activity in Warner Bros. Discovery shares may also be reflecting uncertainty among investors as Paramount revealed its hostile bid on Monday.\n\nThere's also the issue of regulatory approval, which could explain the slight discount in Warner Bros. Discovery stock to Netflix's offer price. Comments from Donald Trump on Monday suggested Netflix's ownership of Warner Bros. could draw scrutiny from the administration.\n\nIn a statement after it unveiled its offer, Paramount said its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery would offer shareholders around $18 billion \n\nNetflix stock is down 7% since last Thursday's close, with shares dropping through Friday's session as investors digested the news that the media giant would acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio business.\n\nInvestors rarely reward the acquirer in a large M&A deal like this, and it appears they're also not thrilled about the prospect of a fierce bidding war.\n\nNetflix stock continued to slide through Monday's session on news of Paramount's competing bid, and dipped again on Tuesday. The streaming platform has agreed to pay Warner Bros. $5.8 billion if its deal doesn't go through.\n\nShares of Paramount Skydance, meanwhile, jumped on Monday on enthusiasm for a potential deal, but the stock slipped 3% on Tuesday.\n\nBettors don't see Paramount's hostile bid going through with ease. While Paramount has edged up slightly over Netflix on some open bets on Polymarket, other wagers have its chances of acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery by mid-2026 at less than 50%.\n\nOn Polymarket, bettors see a 43% chance Paramount will be the winning bid, compared to a 39% chance priced in for Netflix.\n\nOn Kalshi, the odds that Paramount will win are about 50-50.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance and Netflix bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, highlighting streaming, Hollywood jobs, and regulatory approval in their rival pitches.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood's latest high-drama battle of the titans: Paramount versus Netflix.\n\nDavid Ellison's Paramount made a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery after WBD rebuffed its multiple offers and accepted Netflix's offer to buy its studio and streaming business.\n\nThis means Ellison, who is backed by his billionaire father, Larry Ellison of Oracle, is making his case directly to shareholders on why he'd be the best owner for WBD.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"\n\nNetflix didn't respond to the hostile bid but has said that by combining its streaming hits with WBD's classic library and prestige HBO fare, it can supercharge its offering.\n\n\"Together, we can give audiences around the world even more value and choice, and get one step closer to being the most loved and the most valued entertainment company,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in announcing the deal Friday.\n\nHere's how the companies made their cases to various stakeholders, which include investors, employees, Hollywood talent, and regulators.\n\nFinancials: Paramount offered $30 per WBD share for all of WBD, compared to Netflix's offer of $27.75 per WBD share for its streaming and studios business, excluding its TV networks, such as CNN and TNT. While Netflix's offer was a mix of cash and stock, Ellison emphasized that Paramount's offer is all cash, and $17.6 billion more than the Netflix deal, an $82.7 billion offer that includes $72 billion in equity.\n\nApproval: Ellison repeatedly argued that he's more likely to win regulatory approval than Netflix is. He said he anticipated approval coming in as little as 12 months. President Donald Trump said he'll be \"involved\" in evaluating the deal. Larry Ellison is a longtime ally of Trump, and the firm of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is part of the Paramount offer.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Ellison argued that the Paramount deal would be good for jobs and consumers. He said Paramount is committed to growing the film and TV output of both businesses, including a theatrical slate of 30-plus releases a year. It's a pointed contrast with Netflix, whose preference for getting movies onto its streaming service quickly has created friction with the film industry. (Netflix has said it would continue to release Warner Bros. movies in theaters.) Ellison said adding WBD would make Paramount a robust competitor to Netflix, while Netflix buying WBD would extend its dominance in streaming and give it more power to raise prices to consumers.\n\nFinancials: Netflix said the deal would give it a number of financial benefits. While Netflix is the top subscription streaming service, it has a ways to go in creating culture-defining IP. A big part of Netflix's pitch is that it'll be able to build on WBD's famous franchises like DC Comics and Harry Potter, fueling a flywheel that'll expand its business. WBD would have to pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it accepts a different offer, which Netflix said limited its risk. On the other hand, Netflix would have to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee if the deal were blocked by regulators.\n\nApproval: Wall Street analysts have generally characterized Netflix as having a tougher approval path. However, the company has been making the pitch to Trump and his administration. Trump said Sunday that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos visited him last week. Trump said Sarandos was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" However, Trump added that Netflix has \"a very big market share,\" which \"could be a problem.\" Netflix expressed confidence in the approval process, saying it expects the deal to close in 12 to 18 months, after WBD completes its spinoff of linear channels into a new company, Discovery Global.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Netflix said the deal would provide better choice and value for consumers by bringing together the Warner Bros. film and TV show libraries with its own offerings, and help the WBD's creators reach a bigger audience. Netflix said many of its subscribers don't \n\nWith Hollywood employment stagnating, Netflix also argued that the addition of Warner Bros. would let it expand its production and increase jobs over the long term. It expects to achieve $2 billion to $3 billion in cost savings from the deal, primarily coming from eliminating overlapping support staff. Sarandos contrasted this with a Paramount outcome.\n\n\"In the offer Paramount is talking about today, they're talking about $6 billion of synergies,\" he said at a UBS conference on Monday. \"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs. We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"",

    "description": "David Ellison is officially chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance after an $8 billion tie-up. Next on his wish list: Warner Bros Discovery.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison is officially the CEO of Paramount Skydance. After a successful Paramount merger, next on his wish list is Warner Bros. Discovery — and he's launched a hostile takeover bid in an effort to scoop it out from Netflix's hands.\n\nThe 42-year-old founded Skydance back in 2006 with some help from his father Larry Ellison, the Oracle cofounder who's worth $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nSince then, Skydance has enjoyed considerable success with films including \"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\" and \"Baywatch,\" and a total box office haul of more than $8 billion. The merger deal valued Skydance at $4.75 billion.\n\nIts biggest hit has been \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which became the second-highest-grossing film of 2022 after making almost $1.5 billion worldwide.\n\nAfter seeing the original \"Top Gun\" as a child, David Ellison became obsessed with flying. His billionaire father bought him a plane at the age of 13 and they took flying lessons together. By 17, Ellison had begun competing in air shows performing aerial acrobatics.\n\nHe gave up flying competitively after starting a film degree at USC that he later dropped out of, Ellison told Kara Swisher in an episode of The New York Times' \"Sway\" podcast.\n\nBefore becoming an entertainment executive, though, Ellison had a brief foray as an actor.\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in a Skydance film called \"Flyboys,\" about American pilots who flew for the French Air Force in World War I.\n\nThe movie cost about $65 million, but flopped after taking just $18 million or so, per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSince moving behind the camera, Ellison's company has had a relationship with Paramount that dates back to 2011 when Skydance co-financed Joel and Ethan Coen's \"True Grit\" with the studio.\n\nThe film was both a critical and commercial success, winning 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and taking about $200 million at the box office.\n\nEllison's sister, Megan, is also in the movie game. Her production company Annapurna Pictures was behind releases including \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" \"Her,\" \"American Hustle,\" and \"Phantom Thread,\" all of which received Oscar nominations.\n\nThe $8 billion tie-up of Skydance and Paramount officially closed in August. Ellison named himself chairman and CEO of the newly combined company, Paramount Skydance.\n\nSoon after taking the helm, Ellison led Paramount Skydance through layoffs, which can be common in the wake of a merger. The company laid off 1,000 employees in October and said that more cuts were coming. Six hundred employees took severance packages and quit instead of returning to the office, it said.\n\nEllison has also installed Bari Weiss at the top of CBS News. Weiss left The New York Times Opinion section in 2020 and later built the The Free Press, which Paramount Skydance acquired for about $150 million.\n\nEllison continued his spending run. He brought in Netflix veteran Cindy Holland and shelled out $7.7 billion for UFC rights.\n\n\"Everywhere you look, he's throwing money,\" LightShed Partners media analyst Rich Greenfield told Business Insider. \"That's what Hollywood gets excited about.\"\n\nNow, Ellison has his eye on another acquisition: Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nParamount Skydance had earlier entered a competitive bid against Netflix and Comcast to acquire the company.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery ultimately accepted Netflix's bid to purchase the company's streaming and studio business for $72 billion.\n\nEllison is now fighting to stop that from happening. On December 8, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile bid for WBD, offering to pay shareholders $30 per share for the entire company.\n\nThat morning, Ellison made his case to shareholders and WBD's board on CNBC.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"",

    "description": "Paramount's Larry and David Ellison are making a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Three of their partners are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.",
    "fullText": "The governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi want to invest billions of dollars into a would-be mega media conglomerate made up of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWhat would they get for their money?\n\nSpoiler: I don't know. And Paramount, the company that wants to use the three oil nations to help finance its bid for WBD, won't say.\n\nBut it sure seems like a question worth asking, as Paramount launches a hostile bid for WBD after losing last week's auction to Netflix.\n\nParamount says the three petrostates will be part of the new bid — as they were in Paramount's previous offers for WBD (something Paramount had at one point denied).\n\nAs of a week ago, those three countries were going to kick in $24 billion — double the $11.8 billion the Ellison family planned to invest in WBD.\n\nNow, Paramount won't say how much the three countries' sovereign wealth funds plan to invest in their newest proposal. It says Larry and David Ellison, who currently own Paramount, along with RedBird Capital, the private equity group, will \"backstop\" the deal — meaning they promise to finance all of it if necessary.\n\nBut Paramount still anticipates those three countries will ultimately invest in a combined Paramount/WBD, along with Jared Kushner — Donald Trump's son-in-law, whose Affinity Partners group invests money on behalf of … Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, among others.\n\nThe difference this time around, Paramount says, is that those countries' sovereign wealth funds won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would operate. They wouldn't get board seats, voting rights, or any other governance over the company. Paramount declined to comment.\n\nThe reason Paramount needs to stress that, apparently, is that Warner Bros. Discovery had previously flagged that as an issue. Now that the oil states won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would be run, Paramount says the deal wouldn't need approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a regulatory body that's supposed to sign off on foreign investments in some US companies.\n\nThat's all part of Paramount's pitch it is making to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders: A deal for Paramount to buy WBD will pass regulators much more easily than Netflix buying WBD.\n\nBut who knows how that will actually pan out? Up until last week, the conventional wisdom was that Paramount would be the most likely winner for WBD, in no small part because Larry Ellison was a longtime Donald Trump backer, and his son, David, had been trying to curry favor with Trump as well.\n\nNow it turns out that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was also wooing Trump. He visited Trump at the White House, and Trump seems to have been taken with him: \"He was in the Oval Office last week. I have a lot of respect for him. He is a great person,\" Trump told reporters Sunday night. \"Ted has really done a legendary job.\"\n\nSo in a world where Donald Trump is the most important decision-maker when it comes to what American companies are allowed to do, I don't know if the niceties of CFIUS rules will be the ultimate arbiter. (Here I'll note that last year the US passed a law that required China's ByteDance to divest itself of its ownership in the US. TikTok business or shut down. That hasn't happened, and TikTok is still alive and well in the U.S.)\n\nI also don't know if Trump will particularly care that three Middle Eastern oil states could conceivably own a big chunk of a conglomerate that includes CNN, CBS, HBO, and two movie studios. He has been quite eager to do deals in the Middle East, and last month he rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi crown prince at the White House.\n\nAnd perhaps that eagerness explains why Paramount didn't think it was a big deal to include petrostate investments in the past — and why it still thinks it's OK to have them now.\n\nBut again: If Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi are looking to put anything close to $24 billion into an enormously powerful media conglomerate — one with huge reach in both the US and ambitions for the rest of the world — will they be satisfied with purely financial returns? Or do they expect something else for their money?\n\nI'd love to know. Maybe you would, too.",

    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance's bid to purchase Warner Bros. Discovery is a big deal — literally.\n\nThe all-cash offer of $30 per share works out to a valuation of more than $108 billion, or an equity valuation of $78.7 billion, for WBD's entire operation, putting it in the upper echelons of hostile takeover attempts in recent decades.\n\nIn fairness, the $82.7 billion deal, or $72 billion equity valuation, from streaming giant Netflix is also pretty massive. That was the one WBD's board had agreed on, and it excluded certain pieces of the business.\n\n\"We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.\" Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement.\n\nTo get a sense of the biggest hostile takeover deals of the past 30 years, Business Insider asked financial analytics provider Dealogic to pull the numbers.\n\nHere are the equity valuations of the 14 largest hostile takeover announcements since 1995, and where the Paramount deal for WBD would fit in.\n\nComcast launched an unsolicited bid for AT&T Broadband, which was then the largest cable operator in the US. After a few rounds of negotiations and pressure from shareholders, AT&T accepted the offer. The deal gave rise to Comcast's national expansion.\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Tesla made an unsolicited offer to buy Twitter after building a large stake. Twitter initially resisted, but eventually accepted the deal. Musk, however, tried to back out of the deal and was met with litigation, before eventually closing the takeover he started. Musk had since then changed the platform's algorithm, its name, and content moderation rules.\n\nIn what was at the time Europe's largest hostile takeover, RBS and Bank of Scotland fought in a bidding war for NatWest, which ended with RBS's victory through a hostile offer. The deal helped RBS become a global banking giant, but at the cost of taking on excessive debt. RBS collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nRoche, which already owned a majority stake in Genentech, launched a hostile bid for full ownership. The biotech company initially resisted the attempt due to undervaluation. After raising the offer, Roche succeeded.\n\nBAT made an unsolicited offer to buy the remainder of Reynolds, after already owning a large stake in it. Reynolds negotiated a higher price but ultimately accepted the takeover. The deal created the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company at the time.\n\nBelgium's InBev made a hostile offer for Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of beer brand Budweiser. AB's management and founding family initially resisted being taken over by a foreign company, but shareholders pressured them to accept after InBev raised its bid.\n\nBayer made an unsolicited offer to Monsanto, and the chemical company held out for a higher price before accepting the deal. Unfortunately for Bayer, the German biotech company also inherited lawsuits against Monsanto's Roundup herbicide.\n\nTotalFina launched a hostile bid for Elf in a dramatic French corporate battle. After nearly a year of fighting and regulatory scrutiny, the companies merged and became one of the world's biggest oil companies. The combined entity was eventually renamed as TotalEnergies.\n\nJapanese company Takeda made a series of unsolicited bids for UK-based Shire. Shire repeatedly rejected the deal until Takeda substantially increased the offer. This is one of the largest acquisitions ever made by a Japanese company, and it gave Takeda a large rare disease drug portfolio.\n\nSanofi's unsolicited takeover was met with strong resistance from Aventis, so much so that the company sought to be acquired by a different pharmaceutical giant, Novartis. Sanofi sweetened the offer, and Aventis eventually accepted it.\n\nParamount launched its hostile takeover bid after WBD's board bypassed its offers in favor of a deal with Netflix.\n\nPfizer launched a hostile bid to break apart Warner-Lambert's agreed merger with American Home Products. Warner-Lambert fought back but ultimately conceded. This gave Pfizer full ownership of Lipitor, which holds the record for the highest lifetime sales for a single drug.\n\nImmediately before the 2008 financial crisis, Barclays tried to acquire ABN AMRO amicably, but RBS, alongside Fortis and Banco Santander, countered with a hostile, higher bid and won. The acquisition sped up RBS's collapse soon after.\n\nIn a move that consolidated much of the world's beer industry under one entity, AB InBev launched a hostile offer for SABMiller, eventually raising the bid to satisfy resistant shareholders.\n\nUK company Vodafone AirTouch launched a hostile bid for German company Mannesmann, which had rapidly become one of Europe's most valuable telecom companies. Mannesmann fiercely resisted, framing the bid as an attack on German industrial values and national pride. The record-setting battle lasted three months, ending with Vodafone winning by raising the bid.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he wanted to \"do what's right\" in the media war brewing between Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix said that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion. WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.\n\nIn response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well. I know what they're doing, but I have to see, I have to see what percentage of market they have.\"\n\n\"We have to see the Netflix percentage of market, Paramount, the percentage of market,\" he said during a roundtable at the White House. \"I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to do what's right. It's so, so very important to do what's right,\" he added.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he would be involved in the sale of WBD, and that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"\n\nBut he also said that Netflix's CEO, Ted Sarandos, was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"\n\nTrump's involvement in the media war is significant because he has the authority to stop a deal from taking place. In 2017, he voiced his opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.\n\nBusiness Insider's media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, wrote in a column last week that a deal to buy WBD would need regulatory approval, which in 2025 is synonymous with Trump's approval.\n\nParamount is putting up a strong fight for Warner Bros. Its CEO, David Ellison, pitched the WBD offer to his employees in a Monday memo seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison's memo wrote.",
