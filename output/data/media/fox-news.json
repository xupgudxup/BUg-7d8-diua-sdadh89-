    "fullText": "Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo pushed back on the narrative being advanced by FBI Director Kash Patel about Saturday’s shooting death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti at the hands of a border patrol agent in Minneapolis.\n\nIn an interview on Sunday Morning Futures, Patel defended the border patrol’s tactics and questioned Pretti’s motives.\n\n“Secretary [Kristi] Noem stated perfectly, you do not get to attack law enforcement officials in this country without any repercussions,” Patel said. “You do get to do that in Minnesota, L.A., or anywhere else.”\n\nPatel added, “No one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines. That is not a peaceful protest, and you do not get to touch law enforcement. You do that anywhere, this FBI is going to be following — leading the charge to arrest those.”\n\nBartiromo, though, was skeptical of Patel’s argument.\n\n“But how was he threatening Border Patrol?!” Bartiromo asked. “You’ve collected the evidence, you said, right? You have the handgun in your possession. And how was he using that handgun in terms of threatening Border Patrol? What was the threat? He had his camera, right? He was filming it.”\n\nPatel — following the pushback — grew much more cautious in his assessment.\n\n“That’s something that I let the DHS and the prosecutors — because they are the ones investigating that case, I don’t want to stylize that evidence,” Patel said. “But I trust the men and women on the ground who are trained professionals to only use it when it’s absolutely necessary. And I trust Secretary Noem’s leadership and DHS, and HSI to do the right thing, as they’ve always done in these scenarios.”\n\nBartiromo then questioned when Border Patrol agents spotted a weapon on Pretti.\n\n“Kristi Noem said that the individual approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun,” Bartiromo said. “Was the gun visible, or did Border Patrol see the gun after they shot him?”\n\n“Again, all those pieces of the investigation are being led by DHS and HSI, and I don’t wanna comment on their ongoing investigation,” Patel said, demurring.\n\n“I understand,” Bartiromo replied. “But you have the evidence. What can you tell us about the evidence you collected?”\n\nThe answer, it turned out, was precious little.\n\n“It’s sent to our FBI laboratory, where it’ll be finger-pristed,” Patel said. “We’ll use ballistics examination toolkits to see if any casings were fired. And we’ll examine all the casings that were found on the scene.”\n\nThe post ‘How Was He Threatening Border Patrol?!’ Fox’s Maria Bartiromo Pushes Back On FBI Director Kash Patel’s Claims About Shooting of Alex Pretti first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Kayleigh McEnany appeared genuinely taken aback by the Democratic strategist's take.",
    "fullText": "Democratic strategist James Carville on Saturday appeared on Fox News and joined the growing swell of Republicans with his forecast of a “wipeout” of their party in this year’s midterm elections — a prediction that took “Saturday in America” host Kayleigh McEnany aback.\n\nThe discussion was largely prompted by a New York Times op-ed published Thursday by David Plouffe, a political consultant and ex-adviser to former President Barack Obama, who predicted that the Democratic Party will inevitably lose the 2028 presidential election.\n\nPolitics: Pentagon Readies 1,500 Troops For Potential Minnesota Deployment: U.S. Officials\n\nPlouffe argued that the party is “still in crisis” after President Donald Trump swept all seven swing states in the 2024 election, and that Democrats currently have “no credible path” to retake the White House after recent adjustments to the electoral college map.\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts, Carville said he isn’t too concerned about that.\n\n“David is a big-brained guy who’s looking into 2030, what happens in the 2030 census, and that’s good,” he said. “I’m looking at the 2026 elections, and frankly, it’s going to be a wipeout. The Democrats are going to pick up at a minimum 25 seats, maybe as high as 45.”\n\nCarville continued, “In all likelihood, the Democrats are going to carry the Senate, and I think we’re shaping up very well for the 2028 election. But I don’t know, 2030 is…I’m 81, that might be on the other side of my horizon, to be frank with you.”\n\nPolitics: 'It Will Be Done!!!': Trump Issues Ominous New Greenland Warning In Late-Night Rant\n\nThis surprised McEnany, who recently cast an opposite prediction about the midterms.\n\n“Yeah, so, 25 to 45 seats,” she said. “That’s a bold prediction, and you are crushing my prediction on ‘The Five,’ which was that [liberal co-host] Jessica Tarlov would have an unhappy night and Republicans would overperform — which I still believe.”\n\nMcEnany continued, “The trend lines are very good, James, when you look at inflation coming down, when you look at GDP. You think an economic revival, that I think will come, cannot demolish the trend you’re seeing?”\n\nCarville acknowledged, “Well, I guess anything is possible.”\n\nThings took a considerably more serious turn when Carville noted that Republicans might not lose a thing — as Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that “we shouldn’t even have an election” — and said Trump was clearly “hinting at the fact he’s going to try to call them off.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Thursday that the president was “simply joking” and “speaking facetiously” when he said this, arguing to reporters that Trump simply meant, “We’re doing such a great job … maybe we should just keep rolling.”\n\nPolitics: Donald Trump Backs Primary Challenge To GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy\n\nMcEnany agreed with Carville that “the important thing” right now is to ensure they happen.\n\nWhile he inaccurately predicted that then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris would beat Trump in 2024, his forecast of trouble for the GOP aligns with concerns shared among current and former Fox News hosts, as well as GOP consultant Karl Rove.\n\nBen Shapiro Issues Dire Midterms Prediction For The GOP\n\nStephen Miller Says Might Makes Right In Potential U.S. Takeover Of Greenland\n\nCNN Host Picks Apart Pundit's Defense Of Walz, Frey Investigation: 'You Can't Do It'",
