    "description": "The former Yankees All-Star shared a Fox News clip of Speaker Mike Johnson while accusing Democrats of trying to defund ICE.",
    "fullText": "The battle over ICE funding is getting louder with ex-Yankees All-Star Mark Teixeira blasting Democrats online\n\n“Democrats are so radical that they’re willing to shut down the government to defund ICE,” Teixeira wrote on X/Twitter, quote-tweeting a FOX news segment that ran on Sunday. “They want to tear America down, Conservatives want to build it up.\"\n\nIn the FOX News segment, House Speaker Mike Johnson was asked about efforts by democrats in congress to defund ICE.\n\n“We put all of that funding into the Big Beautiful Bill, the working families tax cut, and i’m glad that we did because we had to fix the crisis that was created by the Biden Administration ... they opened the border wide, it was absolute chaos,” Johnson said in a clip shared on X/Twitter. “We allowed, by some estimates, 20 million illegal aliens to come into the country, and many of them hardened, dangerous people, criminals. We’ve got to get them out of the country. So we had to front-load the funding. That will be there as you noted. It doesn’t matter what they do to the current DHS bill, those operations will continue.”\n\nIn the current DHS funding negotiations, Democrats are attempting to “rein in” ICE by proposing significant policy reforms and budget cuts, according to Government Executive.\n\nAmong the things Democrats have pushed for, they’re calling for a $115 million reduction in enforcement, the mandatory use of body cameras and proper identification for agents.\n\nThese efforts were intensified following recent fatal shootings involving federal agents in Minneapolis, leading Senate Democrats to successfully strip the DHS funding out of a larger spending package to force further negotiations.\n\nAs Johnson noted, however, these attempts will likely have little to no impact on ICE’s actual operations because the agency is already funded the previously passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBBA).\n\nThrough that Bill, ICE received $75 billion in multi-year funding that it can use regardless of the current year’s budget outcome. Because of this existing reserve, ICE can continue its operations or several years even if Congress cuts its annual budget or if the government enters a partial shutdown.\n\nOn Aug. 28, Teixeira announced that he’d be running in Texas’s 21st Congressional District, where Rep. Chip Roy will not seek re-election as he runs for Texas Attorney General.\n\nTeixeira is a Maryland native who currently lives in the Austin area. He spent the first four-plus years of his major-league career with the Texas Rangers.\n\nThe three-time All-Star concluded his career with eight years on the Yankees, winning a World Series in 2009.\n\nTeixeira retired in 2016 after a 14-year career in which he hit .268 with a .869 OPS and 409 home runs.\n\nMets, Yankees showing interest in Gold Glove first baseman\n\nTrump unearths 36-year-old letter from George Steinbrenner: ‘You should run for president’\n\nEx-Yankees, Mets pitcher announces retirement\n\nMichael Kay exposes Yankees’ biggest problem — and it has nothing to do with their roster\n\nAre Yankees capable of beating Dodgers in 2026? Is anyone? | Klapisch",

    "description": "Speaker Mike Johnson rallied Republicans around President Donald Trump's deal with Democrats to keep the government funded, Fox News Digital was told.",
    "fullText": "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., urged House Republicans on a lawmaker-only call to rally behind President Donald Trump after the commander in chief struck a deal with Senate Democrats to avert a prolonged government shutdown, Fox News Digital was told Friday evening.\n\nThe top House Republican admitted to being \"frustrated\" by the result, sources told Fox News Digital, but he lauded Trump's deal-making ability and called for lawmakers to back the president's decision.\n\nThe Senate passed a revamped government funding deal Friday that will set the federal budget through the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30, save for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nIt comes after Democrats walked away from a bipartisan plan to fully fund the federal government over demands for stricter guardrails on Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) than what the initial House-passed package included.\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide To Why There May Be A Partial Government Shutdown Saturday\n\nJohnson told House Republicans he went to the White House Wednesday to lay out his arguments for sticking to the initial plan and warned, \"Opening the Pandora's Box of amending this thing could be a dangerous prospect,\" sources said.\n\nTrump nevertheless struck an agreement with Senate Democrats.\n\nFox News Digital was told that Johnson conceded, \"The president has made a play call, and we have to support him on it.\"\n\nThe initial bipartisan DHS bill included guardrails for ICE, such as mandating body-worn cameras and training for public engagement and de-escalation. But Democrats are now demanding significantly more after a second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal law enforcement during demonstrations against Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nSenate Gop Holdouts Refuse To Budge As Shutdown Talks Continue\n\nThe new deal struck with Democrats would only extend current DHS funding levels for two weeks to keep other critical agencies under the department’s purview funded while new bipartisan negotiations on immigration enforcement play out.\n\nMultiple Republican lawmakers have both publicly and privately expressed concern about the deal, arguing it could potentially give Democrats more ability to constrain the administration.\n\nOne House Republican voiced such concerns on the lawmaker-only call on Friday, Fox News Digital was told. Johnson, according to sources, agreed he was \"frustrated … but I've got to tip my hat to the president. He knows the art of the deal.\"\n\nSenate Republicans Weigh Dem Demand To Split Dhs Bill, Turn To Short-term Extension To Avoid Shutdown\n\nJohnson told House Republicans that Trump now needed their support to \"navigate the next two weeks\" of deal-making with Democrats.\n\nTrump said on Truth Social of his deal with Democrats, \"I am working hard with Congress to ensure that we are able to fully fund the Government, without delay. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come together to get the vast majority of the Government funded until September, while at the same time providing an extension to the Department of Homeland Security (including the very important Coast Guard, which we are expanding and rebuilding like never before).\"\n\nSources said the speaker did sound optimistic about Republicans still having leverage in the talks, however. Johnson noted that ICE had already been funded under Trump’s \"big, beautiful bill\" and that it would be offices like the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that would run low on funds.\n\nSources said Johnson said of Democrats, \"We can hang that on their necks.\"\n\nThe House is expected to take up the legislation by Monday evening.\n\nOriginal article source: 'Opening Pandora's Box': Mike Johnson backs Trump after warning White House about deal with Democrats",

    "fullText": "Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo pushed back on the narrative being advanced by FBI Director Kash Patel about Saturday’s shooting death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti at the hands of a border patrol agent in Minneapolis.\n\nIn an interview on Sunday Morning Futures, Patel defended the border patrol’s tactics and questioned Pretti’s motives.\n\n“Secretary [Kristi] Noem stated perfectly, you do not get to attack law enforcement officials in this country without any repercussions,” Patel said. “You do get to do that in Minnesota, L.A., or anywhere else.”\n\nPatel added, “No one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines. That is not a peaceful protest, and you do not get to touch law enforcement. You do that anywhere, this FBI is going to be following — leading the charge to arrest those.”\n\nBartiromo, though, was skeptical of Patel’s argument.\n\n“But how was he threatening Border Patrol?!” Bartiromo asked. “You’ve collected the evidence, you said, right? You have the handgun in your possession. And how was he using that handgun in terms of threatening Border Patrol? What was the threat? He had his camera, right? He was filming it.”\n\nPatel — following the pushback — grew much more cautious in his assessment.\n\n“That’s something that I let the DHS and the prosecutors — because they are the ones investigating that case, I don’t want to stylize that evidence,” Patel said. “But I trust the men and women on the ground who are trained professionals to only use it when it’s absolutely necessary. And I trust Secretary Noem’s leadership and DHS, and HSI to do the right thing, as they’ve always done in these scenarios.”\n\nBartiromo then questioned when Border Patrol agents spotted a weapon on Pretti.\n\n“Kristi Noem said that the individual approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun,” Bartiromo said. “Was the gun visible, or did Border Patrol see the gun after they shot him?”\n\n“Again, all those pieces of the investigation are being led by DHS and HSI, and I don’t wanna comment on their ongoing investigation,” Patel said, demurring.\n\n“I understand,” Bartiromo replied. “But you have the evidence. What can you tell us about the evidence you collected?”\n\nThe answer, it turned out, was precious little.\n\n“It’s sent to our FBI laboratory, where it’ll be finger-pristed,” Patel said. “We’ll use ballistics examination toolkits to see if any casings were fired. And we’ll examine all the casings that were found on the scene.”\n\nThe post ‘How Was He Threatening Border Patrol?!’ Fox’s Maria Bartiromo Pushes Back On FBI Director Kash Patel’s Claims About Shooting of Alex Pretti first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Kayleigh McEnany appeared genuinely taken aback by the Democratic strategist's take.",
    "fullText": "Democratic strategist James Carville on Saturday appeared on Fox News and joined the growing swell of Republicans with his forecast of a “wipeout” of their party in this year’s midterm elections — a prediction that took “Saturday in America” host Kayleigh McEnany aback.\n\nThe discussion was largely prompted by a New York Times op-ed published Thursday by David Plouffe, a political consultant and ex-adviser to former President Barack Obama, who predicted that the Democratic Party will inevitably lose the 2028 presidential election.\n\nPolitics: Pentagon Readies 1,500 Troops For Potential Minnesota Deployment: U.S. Officials\n\nPlouffe argued that the party is “still in crisis” after President Donald Trump swept all seven swing states in the 2024 election, and that Democrats currently have “no credible path” to retake the White House after recent adjustments to the electoral college map.\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts, Carville said he isn’t too concerned about that.\n\n“David is a big-brained guy who’s looking into 2030, what happens in the 2030 census, and that’s good,” he said. “I’m looking at the 2026 elections, and frankly, it’s going to be a wipeout. The Democrats are going to pick up at a minimum 25 seats, maybe as high as 45.”\n\nCarville continued, “In all likelihood, the Democrats are going to carry the Senate, and I think we’re shaping up very well for the 2028 election. But I don’t know, 2030 is…I’m 81, that might be on the other side of my horizon, to be frank with you.”\n\nPolitics: 'It Will Be Done!!!': Trump Issues Ominous New Greenland Warning In Late-Night Rant\n\nThis surprised McEnany, who recently cast an opposite prediction about the midterms.\n\n“Yeah, so, 25 to 45 seats,” she said. “That’s a bold prediction, and you are crushing my prediction on ‘The Five,’ which was that [liberal co-host] Jessica Tarlov would have an unhappy night and Republicans would overperform — which I still believe.”\n\nMcEnany continued, “The trend lines are very good, James, when you look at inflation coming down, when you look at GDP. You think an economic revival, that I think will come, cannot demolish the trend you’re seeing?”\n\nCarville acknowledged, “Well, I guess anything is possible.”\n\nThings took a considerably more serious turn when Carville noted that Republicans might not lose a thing — as Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that “we shouldn’t even have an election” — and said Trump was clearly “hinting at the fact he’s going to try to call them off.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Thursday that the president was “simply joking” and “speaking facetiously” when he said this, arguing to reporters that Trump simply meant, “We’re doing such a great job … maybe we should just keep rolling.”\n\nPolitics: Donald Trump Backs Primary Challenge To GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy\n\nMcEnany agreed with Carville that “the important thing” right now is to ensure they happen.\n\nWhile he inaccurately predicted that then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris would beat Trump in 2024, his forecast of trouble for the GOP aligns with concerns shared among current and former Fox News hosts, as well as GOP consultant Karl Rove.\n\nBen Shapiro Issues Dire Midterms Prediction For The GOP\n\nStephen Miller Says Might Makes Right In Potential U.S. Takeover Of Greenland\n\nCNN Host Picks Apart Pundit's Defense Of Walz, Frey Investigation: 'You Can't Do It'",

Interest rates have dropped drastically since last January. Lock in your HELOC or HEL rate today.\n\nSeattle's level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams.\n\nEdwards made an explosive return after missing Minnesota's past two games with a right foot injury.\n\nThe Falcons have their next head coach.\n\nBills fans were already mad about a controversial interception, then had to contend with pass interference and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties that assured a Broncos playoff win.\n\nThe Broncos were +325 to win the Super Bowl at BetMGM, but the news of quarterback Bo Nix's season-ending ankle injury pushed their odds out to +1000.\n\nBroncos cornerback Ja'Quan McMillian pried the ball away from Brandin Cooks, but then a fierce debate ensued over whether the receiver was already down with possession.\n\nLaFleur has a 76-40-1 record in seven seasons, but questions emerged about his job security after a wild-card loss to the Bears.\n\nAfter plenty of courting from the Giants' brass, John Harbaugh appears headed to New York.",

    "fullText": "The hosts of The Big Weekend Show on Fox News were shocked and disgusted to learn that anti-ICE protesters in Minnesota were using Grindr and other dating apps to “expose” ICE agents.\n\nFox News highlighted a Saturday report from the New York Post on “lefty TikTokers” who are calling on their comrades to “get those d*ck pics and selfies and share them widely,” as one user put it.\n\nThat same TikTok user told her “gay friends in Minneapolis on Grindr” to be on high alert for ICE agents “because you know that [the app is] blowing up right now with all of the visitors from out of town and I bet you could get some pretty good info.”\n\nAnother user urged her fellow anti-ICE Minnesotans to send screenshots of agents on Bumble and other dating apps; she said she was compiling a folder full of details on ICE agents and needed as much ammo as she could get.\n\nThe Big Weekend Show showed clips of those women making their pleas before getting the panel’s reaction.\n\n“Are they trying to shame federal agents who may be homosexual? They always bring their own arguments full circle—” co-host Joey Jones started to ask before Fox News contributor David Webb jumped in.\n\n“Let me ask the left — what do you have against homosexuals or somebody whose gay if they happen to be in law enforcement?” Webb asked. “You gonna out them?”\n\nWebb said Minnesotans would be better off if ICE “unmasked all of these rioters, these people who are out there protecting criminals [and] committing crimes.”\n\nBeyond patrolling Grindr, protesters have been demonstrating against — and in some cases “physically” interfering with — ICE raids following the shooting death of Renee Good.\n\nA moment later, Jones said it was sick that lefty Minnesotans want to “want to go after the individual, not the job they’re doing or the policy that Congress passed.”\n\nFox News senior correspondent Alicia Acuna agreed, saying the protesters have their priorities backwards.\n\n“They don’t come out and shame the violent criminals who have been arrested, who are in this country illegally and victimized so many people,” Acuna said. “They have no shame.”\n\nThe post ‘What Do You Have Against Homosexuals?’ Fox News Hosts Shocked By Minnesota Protestors Exposing ICE Agents on Grindr first appeared on Mediaite.",
