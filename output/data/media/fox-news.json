    "description": "Kayleigh McEnany appeared genuinely taken aback by the Democratic strategist's take.",
    "fullText": "Democratic strategist James Carville on Saturday appeared on Fox News and joined the growing swell of Republicans with his forecast of a “wipeout” of their party in this year’s midterm elections — a prediction that took “Saturday in America” host Kayleigh McEnany aback.\n\nThe discussion was largely prompted by a New York Times op-ed published Thursday by David Plouffe, a political consultant and ex-adviser to former President Barack Obama, who predicted that the Democratic Party will inevitably lose the 2028 presidential election.\n\nPolitics: Pentagon Readies 1,500 Troops For Potential Minnesota Deployment: U.S. Officials\n\nPlouffe argued that the party is “still in crisis” after President Donald Trump swept all seven swing states in the 2024 election, and that Democrats currently have “no credible path” to retake the White House after recent adjustments to the electoral college map.\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts, Carville said he isn’t too concerned about that.\n\n“David is a big-brained guy who’s looking into 2030, what happens in the 2030 census, and that’s good,” he said. “I’m looking at the 2026 elections, and frankly, it’s going to be a wipeout. The Democrats are going to pick up at a minimum 25 seats, maybe as high as 45.”\n\nCarville continued, “In all likelihood, the Democrats are going to carry the Senate, and I think we’re shaping up very well for the 2028 election. But I don’t know, 2030 is…I’m 81, that might be on the other side of my horizon, to be frank with you.”\n\nPolitics: 'It Will Be Done!!!': Trump Issues Ominous New Greenland Warning In Late-Night Rant\n\nThis surprised McEnany, who recently cast an opposite prediction about the midterms.\n\n“Yeah, so, 25 to 45 seats,” she said. “That’s a bold prediction, and you are crushing my prediction on ‘The Five,’ which was that [liberal co-host] Jessica Tarlov would have an unhappy night and Republicans would overperform — which I still believe.”\n\nMcEnany continued, “The trend lines are very good, James, when you look at inflation coming down, when you look at GDP. You think an economic revival, that I think will come, cannot demolish the trend you’re seeing?”\n\nCarville acknowledged, “Well, I guess anything is possible.”\n\nThings took a considerably more serious turn when Carville noted that Republicans might not lose a thing — as Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that “we shouldn’t even have an election” — and said Trump was clearly “hinting at the fact he’s going to try to call them off.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Thursday that the president was “simply joking” and “speaking facetiously” when he said this, arguing to reporters that Trump simply meant, “We’re doing such a great job … maybe we should just keep rolling.”\n\nPolitics: Donald Trump Backs Primary Challenge To GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy\n\nMcEnany agreed with Carville that “the important thing” right now is to ensure they happen.\n\nWhile he inaccurately predicted that then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris would beat Trump in 2024, his forecast of trouble for the GOP aligns with concerns shared among current and former Fox News hosts, as well as GOP consultant Karl Rove.\n\nBen Shapiro Issues Dire Midterms Prediction For The GOP\n\nStephen Miller Says Might Makes Right In Potential U.S. Takeover Of Greenland\n\nCNN Host Picks Apart Pundit's Defense Of Walz, Frey Investigation: 'You Can't Do It'",

    "fullText": "The hosts of The Big Weekend Show on Fox News were shocked and disgusted to learn that anti-ICE protesters in Minnesota were using Grindr and other dating apps to “expose” ICE agents.\n\nFox News highlighted a Saturday report from the New York Post on “lefty TikTokers” who are calling on their comrades to “get those d*ck pics and selfies and share them widely,” as one user put it.\n\nThat same TikTok user told her “gay friends in Minneapolis on Grindr” to be on high alert for ICE agents “because you know that [the app is] blowing up right now with all of the visitors from out of town and I bet you could get some pretty good info.”\n\nAnother user urged her fellow anti-ICE Minnesotans to send screenshots of agents on Bumble and other dating apps; she said she was compiling a folder full of details on ICE agents and needed as much ammo as she could get.\n\nThe Big Weekend Show showed clips of those women making their pleas before getting the panel’s reaction.\n\n“Are they trying to shame federal agents who may be homosexual? They always bring their own arguments full circle—” co-host Joey Jones started to ask before Fox News contributor David Webb jumped in.\n\n“Let me ask the left — what do you have against homosexuals or somebody whose gay if they happen to be in law enforcement?” Webb asked. “You gonna out them?”\n\nWebb said Minnesotans would be better off if ICE “unmasked all of these rioters, these people who are out there protecting criminals [and] committing crimes.”\n\nBeyond patrolling Grindr, protesters have been demonstrating against — and in some cases “physically” interfering with — ICE raids following the shooting death of Renee Good.\n\nA moment later, Jones said it was sick that lefty Minnesotans want to “want to go after the individual, not the job they’re doing or the policy that Congress passed.”\n\nFox News senior correspondent Alicia Acuna agreed, saying the protesters have their priorities backwards.\n\n“They don’t come out and shame the violent criminals who have been arrested, who are in this country illegally and victimized so many people,” Acuna said. “They have no shame.”\n\nThe post ‘What Do You Have Against Homosexuals?’ Fox News Hosts Shocked By Minnesota Protestors Exposing ICE Agents on Grindr first appeared on Mediaite.",
