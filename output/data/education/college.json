    "fullText": "With the book officially closed on the 2025 college football season and a new national champion having been crowned, it is now time to shift our focus to the 2026 college football season. It's never too early for that, right? As is typically the case when the season comes to a close, the tradition of way-too-early top-25 projections are making the rounds already, and one of the more interesting teams to scout on these lists will be Penn State.\n\nFollowing a program-changing 2025 season with an in-season coaching change and the hiring of Matt Campbell to steer the ship back on course, and with a massive offseason roster overhaul as a result, Penn State may be a difficult team for many to accurately project in the 2026 season. But that will not stop anyone from attempting to gauge where the Nittany Lions will be sitting next season. If one way-too-early top-25 list from On3 is any indication, Penn State could be on the College Football Playoff bubble next fall.\n\nOn3 released its way-too-early top-25 list and gave Penn State a No. 14 projection. Putting Penn State somewhere in the middle of any top-25 projection feels somewhat fair given the changes wiht the program and puts some trust in Campbell to turn things around from Penn State's 2025 season. It also feels like a pretty safe projection to suggest Penn State could be in the playoff hunt but may fall just outside of it.\n\nOhio State tops the On3 top-25 outlook, followed by Georgia, Texas, and Notre Dame, respectively. 2025 national champion Indiana takes the No. 5 slot in the On3 way-too-early top-25, with Oregon right behind the Hoosiers to give the Big Ten three top-10 teams in this projection. Michigan is the only other Big Ten team ranked ahead of Penn State, at No. 11.\n\nOther Big Ten teams ranked in On3's early projection are Washington (No. 18), USC (No. 19), and Iowa (No. 21). Penn State will play road games next season at Michigan and Washington and will host USC. The Nittany Lions will not face Ohio State, Indiana, or Oregon during the regular season in 2026. Also of note, On3 also ranks Virginia Tech, now coached by former Penn State head coach James Franklin, at No. 23.\n\nFollow Kevin McGuire on Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.\n\nFollow Nittany Lions Wire on X, Facebook, and Threads.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: Where Penn State ranks in On3's way-too-early top 25 for 2026 season",

    "fullText": "Undefeated teams in college football history: Here's a list of every perfect national champion all time originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCollege football tends to thrive on chaos.\n\nUpsets are what makes the sport so captivating at times — when a smaller school topples a national power, it reminds fans what they enjoy so much about the landscape of NCAA football. But while upsets are fun, there are sometimes teams that are simply too dominant to overcome.\n\nCollege football has had its share of teams to go unbeaten across an entire season, some of which also claimed a win in that year's national championship. Some undefeated squads didn't get the opportunity to play for the title, while others steamrolled their way to college football glory, whether in the College Football Playoff, Bowl Championship Series or other previous playoff systems.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of the history of undefeated college football teams, including national champions.\n\nMORE: Which teams have the most wins in college football history?\n\nWith college football having a complicated history within its structure, there a few ways to view the history of undefeated teams — regardless of whether they won a national championship or not. In total, there have likely been hundreds teams to finish a college football season unbeaten, but with varying circumstances, tiebreaker and playoff rules and number of games.\n\nPre-1900, when college football was still free of ties and informal with plenty of differing rules, the NCAA has 26 teams on-record to finish their season unbeaten and untied, per the NCAA's 2009 Division I records report, which included any teams with a minimum of five games against opponents above the high school level. From 1900 to 1936, the year the AP Poll was introduced, there were an additional 133 teams to finish a season unbeaten and untied.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1991, the year before the Bowl Coalition was created — helping to better establish a national champion and provide better-quality bowl matchups — the NCAA has 134 teams on-record to finish a season unbeaten and untied.\n\nFrom 1992-2013, which spans between the Bowl Coalition, Bowl Alliance and Bowl Championship Series eras of the postseason, the NCAA has 40 teams on-record to go unbeaten and untied.\n\nHowever, in terms of comparing college football teams, it's easiest to assess the unbeaten teams in the College Football Playoff era, since 2014. Because this playoff format is still used by the NCAA, allows top teams to go head-to-head in the playoff, and limits the number of unbeaten squads, it's the easiest way to assess a \"perfect\" team in recent history.\n\nIn the CFP era, there have been seven FBS teams to go unbeaten in a full season, six of which won the CFP championship. A 13-0 USF team in 2017, which was not selected to the playoff bracket, is the lone non-champion.\n\nTrimming the parameters from 1994-2025, which largely covers the most modern era of college football, there have been a total of 30 FBS teams to go undefeated in a season. Nebraska had three (1994, 1995, 1997), while 11 of those 30 teams did not with the national championship, for varying reasons.\n\nOverall, the history of unbeaten teams is a complicated one, especially when looking at non-national champions. With the CFP in place, the era of multiple undefeated teams in one season is virtually obsolete, helping to quiet those complications. For years, there were consistently undefeated teams that didn't get a shot at the championship, including 1998 Tulane, 2004 Auburn, 2006 Boise State, 2008 Utah and 2010 TCU.\n\nExamining the history of undefeated teams to win the national championship is a bit more defined — while there have been many college football teams to finish a season unbeaten, especially in the early eras of the sport, a more select few have gone unbeaten with a title.\n\nMORE: Most losses in college football history by school\n\nSince 1936, the year the Associated Press released its first Top 25 poll, there have been 64 NCAA-recognized undefeated college football champions. That includes co-title holders.\n\nNotre Dame has six of those perfect championship seasons, while Nebraska and Alabama both have five.\n\nHere's the list of every undefeated national champion, separated by era (CFP, BCS, pre-BCS), according to the NCAA.\n\nMORE:What to know about college football overtime rules\n\nIn January of 2026, Indiana became the most recent undefeated college football team.\n\nPrior to Indiana, the last college football team to finish a season undefeated was the Michigan Wolverines in 2023. Led by head coach John Harbaugh and quarterback J.J. McCarthy, the Big Ten squad went 15-0 and won the College Football Playoff championship over Washington. Michigan's 2023 season resulted in controversy over a sign-stealing scandal, however.\n\nHarbaugh, in his ninth season at Michigan, guided his team to a 12-0 regular season in 2023. The Wolverines then beat Iowa 26-0 in the Big Ten Championship game and took down Alabama 27-20 in overtime of the Rose Bowl, a CFP semifinal game. To win the national title, Michigan beat Washington 34-13, winning the 12 title in program history and first since 1997.\n\nMichigan became the first national champion to have a lead at halftime in every game it played since 2001 Miami. Harbaugh's unit also became the first-ever Big Ten team to go 15-0. Outside of McCarthy, key contributors included guard Zak Zinte, running back Blake Corum, tight end Colston Loveland, defensive lineman Mason Graham and cornerbacks Mike Sainristil and Will Johnson.\n\nThere were a few reasons for controversy around Michigan's 2023 season, though. For one, Harbaugh had been suspended by his university for the first three games of the season due to alleged recruiting violations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, in November of the 2023 season, a sign-stealing scandal became apparent that gained national interests.\n\nIn October 2023, the NCAA began Michigan's football program amid allegations of sign-stealing, the Big Ten announced. The Wolverines were being accused of in-person scouting of future opponents. In early November, staffer Connor Stalions resigned due to his role in the schemes, while Harbaugh was suspended by the Big Ten for the team's final three regular-season games for violating sportsmanship rules.\n\nEventually, the NCAA's investigation officially found in 2025 that Michigan's football program had \"committed violations involving an off-campus, in-person scouting scheme.\" Through interview testimonies, ticket receipts and transfer data and other evidence, Stalions was found to have made scouting violations.\n\n\"During the 2021, 2022 and 2023 football seasons, Stalions directed and arranged for individuals to conduct off-campus, in-person scouting of Michigan's future regular-season opponents. In doing so, Stalions purchased game tickets and transferred them to those individuals, who included another staff member, interns and acquaintances of Stalions. The network of individuals was referred to as the 'KGB.' While in attendance, they filmed the signal callers on the future opponents' sidelines and then provided that film to Stalions,\" the NCAA's report said. \"Using the footage they collected — which Stalions referred to as 'dirty film' — Stalions then deciphered opponents' signals. Stalions and other individuals involved in the scheme acknowledged or corroborated this process.\n\nAdditionally, on one occasion, Stalions personally attended a future opponent's contest. In total, 56 instances of off-campus, in-person scouting of 13 future regular- season opponents occurred across 52 contests.\"\n\nThe NCAA's report also said that Stalions had spent nearly $35,000 on tickets in 2022 alone for the scheme. It also reported that Stalions, Harbaugh, Sherrone Moore and former director of player personnel Denard Robinson all failed to meet \"expectations of cooperation\" in the investigation, ranging from \"destroying relevant materials\" to \"providing false and misleading information during interviews.\"\n\nPunishments for the scandal were also released by the NCAA. Then-Michigan head coach, Sherrone Moore, was suspended three games, Stalions received an eight-year show-cause penalty, Harbaugh received a 10-year show-cause, and a fine was expected to eclipse $30 million for the school, per ESPN.\n\nRegardless of that investigation and the noise in made in the college football world, the Wolverines continued their dominance into the CFP and completed a perfect season. After the title win, Harbaugh left the program to be the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers in the NFL, not dealing with many of the consequences that were handed to the program from the sign-stealing scandal.\n\nMORE:Explaining the 2025 Sherrone Moore scandal at Michigan\n\nTwo teams have gone 16-0 in college football history: Indiana in 2025 and Yale in 1984. While Yale football team accomplished the feat. in 1984, thought, there are plenty of reasons to take that feat with a bit of an asterisk.\n\nThere wasn't just no CFP or no officially recognized national champions in 1894 — there was minimal padding for players and no helmets. It was a much different sport in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\nSince then, there have been a number of teams to go 15-0, but going 16-0 often hasn't been a possibility due to the length of the regular season, or the playoff format. If you count the FCS, there has been one other 16-0 team: North Dakota State in 2019.\n\nWith the creation of the 12-team CFP in 2024, it became possible for an FBS team to play 16 games between the regular season, their conference championship and the playoff bracket. In January 2026, the Indiana Hoosiers joined 1894 Yale as the only 16-0 teams in college football history.\n\nMORE: The full list of biggest blowouts in CFP history",

    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Carson Beck was part of two national championship runs at Georgia.\n\nTo him, those seasons weren't as good as this one was for him at Miami.\n\nBeck's last pass as a college quarterback was an interception, one that essentially sealed Miami's fate in a 27-21 loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff national championship game on Monday night. He had to watch the Hoosiers celebrate on what was his home field, watch the turf littered in crimson-and-white confetti.\n\nAnd yet, when he reflected on the end of his journey, he declared this year at Miami the best of his life.\n\n“Yeah, it was,” Beck said after a 19-for-32 passing, 232-yard, one-touchdown, one-interception performance in the final. “And not because we made the national championship, not because won a bunch of football games or we made great plays or things of that sort. Man, for me, my whole entire life changed.\n\n\"You know, 365 days ago, I was in just a really dark place, and I was trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It was a really difficult thing. There was just a lot going on, mentally, physically, emotionally, to be able to battle and fight through the roller-coaster that life is.\"\n\nAt this time a year ago, Beck was no longer wanted at Georgia, his elbow had just been surgically rebuilt, every move of his personal life became social-media fodder and he knew the doubters were everywhere.\n\nHe almost got the last laugh. Beck started all 16 games for Miami, led the Hurricanes to a 13-3 mark and set a school record by completing 72.4% of his passes. The last pass was a bit underthrown, and there seemed to be some sort of miscommunication on the final play. (“Their defense played really well tonight,\" Beck said.) But Miami knew long before that play that without Beck, they wouldn't have gotten anywhere near the CFP title game.\n\n“He earned the respect of his teammates, teammates working hard with him,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “We win together, we lose together. Proud of him.”\n\nBeck was at Miami for one year. He made clear after his final college game that whatever the future brings, he'll have the Hurricanes to thank.\n\n“I really couldn’t have done it without all these people around me,” Beck said. “This university truly saved me and helped me rebuild into the man that I am today.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS — The field was covered in red-and-white confetti, and the Heisman Trophy quarterback was covered in bruises. The college football season had just come down to the very final minute, and a team of perpetual sorrow was dancing toward glory.\n\nThis is what it looks like when reality surpasses fantasy.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana, emerging from a century of gloom, won the College Football Playoff national championship game, 27-21, against No. 10 Miami on Monday night in what feels like a seismic shift in possibilities for forgotten programs everywhere.\n\nWere they watching Monday night in Starkville, Mississippi?\n\nHow about in Ames, Iowa? Maybe even in the shadow of a new campus stadium in Tampa?\n\n“We’re 16-0 and national champions at Indiana University,” head coach Curt Cignetti said. “I know a lot of people thought that was never possible. It’s probably one of the greatest sports stories of all time.”\n\nThe Hoosiers, a team that had not won a conference championship in nearly 60 years and was more than 200 games below .500 before Cignetti arrived in 2024, went 16-0 and won the national championship just two years after going 3-9. If that kind of turnaround is possible in the new world of college football, can any dream be considered too outlandish in the days to come?\n\nQuarterback Fernando Mendoza, who grew up just miles from Hard Rock Stadium and was all but ignored by his beloved University of Miami as a Columbus High senior, played a virtually flawless game despite a fierce pass rush from the Hurricanes.\n\n“Tonight is going to be an insane night,” Mendoza said during the onfield trophy presentation. “I can’t wait to get back to Bloomington with the guys.”\n\nThere was nothing accidental about what Indiana accomplished this season. The record was perfect, and it was absolutely a reflection of the team’s play.\n\nThe Hoosiers were disciplined (fifth in the nation in penalties per game), they were explosive (second in points per game), they were stingy (second in points allowed per game) and they were smart (first in turnover margin).\n\nThey beat defending national champion Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game, and then crushed Alabama and Oregon by a combined 94-25 in their first two playoff games. All that stood in Indiana’s way was a Miami team that defied projections with upsets of higher-seeded teams in the first two rounds of the playoffs before dispatching Ole Miss in the semifinals.\n\nThe Hoosiers controlled the ball and frustrated the Hurricanes in the first half, and then came up with clutch plays on offense and special teams in the second half as Miami staged a furious comeback.\n\nAnd, in the end, Indiana’s fearlessness was the difference.\n\nAfter Miami had cut the lead to 17-14, the Hoosiers answered with a touchdown drive for the ages. It wasn’t that they held the ball for 12 plays or that they traveled 75 yards. It was that Cignetti put faith in his quarterback on a fourth and 5 instead of punting from the Miami 37, and then again on fourth down from the Miami 4. On the first conversion, Mendoza hit Charlie Becker on a 19-yard, back-shoulder completion. That was just the appetizer.\n\nOn fourth down from the 4, Indiana initially called the field-goal unit on the field. After a timeout, Cignetti sent the offense back out and Mendoza, on a quarterback draw, bounced off defenders and dove into the endzone for the touchdown.\n\n“They called that play and we knew, ‘Hey, we’re going to bet on ourselves one more time in the biggest (moment) of the game,’” Mendoza said.\n\nIn a way, this is what so many fans wanted. A college football postseason with the suspense of an NCAA basketball tournament.\n\nAlabama, Clemson, Georgia and Ohio State had become as ubiquitous in January as Dick Clark and Times Square. From 2014-22, there was not a single national championship game without at least one of those teams. And six of those games included some variation of two of those programs playing each other.\n\nThat’s the hierarchy the transfer portal torched. And this is the future that name, image and likeness money has begat.\n\nMiami, on Monday night, was playing in a national title game for the first time in 23 years. The last time Indiana had even a whiff of national title consideration was when the Hoosiers lost 14-3 to No. 1 USC in the 1968 Rose Bowl and finished No. 4 in the final Associated Press poll.\n\nIt’s a new era of college football.\n\nIt’s not perfect, by any means. It’s not beloved by traditionalists aghast with players jumping from school to school, and it’s practically blasphemous for programs accustomed to sitting atop the mountaintop.\n\nBut, as the 2025 season demonstrated, there is something exhilarating about the unknown. Something thrilling about new faces and stories.\n\nSomething remarkable about a program that could endure 26 losing seasons in 30 years and, with a new coach on board, emerge to go 27-2 across his first two seasons and win a national championship.\n\nWelcome to the new world order.\n\nJohn Romano can be reached at jromano@tampabay.com.

    "fullText": "Carson Beck will have plenty of fond memories to look back on from his college football career.\n\nBut it ended Monday in heartbreak.\n\nWith a chance to lead Miami on a drive for its sixth national championship, Beck threw an interception that sealed Indiana's first. His intended target on the play, Keelan Marion, never saw the ball in the air.\n\nWith the clock ticking under two minutes, Miami's defense held Indiana to a field goal that gave the Hoosiers a 27-21 lead. Beck then led the offense onto the field with 1:42 remaining, in need of a touchdown that could seal a national title on Miami's home field.\n\nMiami overcame a delay of game penalty before the first snap with a pair of first downs that put them over midfield. The first first down of the drive arrived courtesy of a roughing the passer penalty that resulted in the back of Beck's head hitting the turf.\n\nWith the Hurricanes facing first and 10 at the Indiana 41, Beck decided to go for it all with 51 seconds remaining. Marion ran a go route down the left sideline, facing man coverage from cornerback Jamari Sharpe and safety help over the top.\n\nBeck launched a deep ball that never stood a chance.\n\njamari sharpe game sealing interception; miami vs indiana pic.twitter.com/ceKYojVw14\n\n— ◇ (@F0RGIAT0) January 20, 2026\n\nThe ball was short and thrown into double coverage. Sharpe pinpointed it for an interception at the 15-yard line as Marion continued to run toward the end zone.\n\nWith Miami out of timeouts, all that was left for the Hoosiers to clinch the national championship was to run out the clock. They did just that for a 27-21 win.\n\nAnd Beck will finish his college career with two national championships as a backup at Georgia, but none as a starter.\n\nThe turnover was the first of the night for either team on a night when Beck completed 19 of 32 passes for 232 yards with 1 touchdown and the late interception.\n\nBeck was asked after the game how he was feeling on the last drive after the roughing-the-passer hit.\n\n\"My ears are ringing,\" Beck said, per ESPN's Pete Thamel.\n\nBeck also spoke with reporters about the game-sealing interception.\n\nHere’s Carson Beck explaining the final interception. pic.twitter.com/COIrwqYO4C\n\n— Clay Ferraro (@ClayWPLG) January 20, 2026\n\n\"The guy made a really good play,\" Beck said. \"They were in cover 2 and he sunk with no flat threat, made a really good play on the ball.\n\n\"So again, a lot of credit to them and their defense. They played really, really well tonight.\"\n\nPer Thamel, Marion was in tears in the postgame locker room with a towel over his head. He said that the interception was his \"mistake\" and that he didn't realize that Beck had thrown the pass.\n\n\"I didn't even know he had threw the ball,\" Marion said. ... “I got to look for the ball and make that play for him. So that's all on me.”\n\nHere's a look at the Marion's route from the sideline near the end zone. Marion didn't look back for the ball until he crossed the 20-yard line after Sharpe had made his break on the ball. By then, it was too late.\n\nI see what Carson Beck saw here. Why is Keelan Marion running with his head down? I really don’t understand. pic.twitter.com/XopqjBbpVp\n\n— Miami Hurricanes 2026 National Champs 🏆 (@nijayforeverlit) January 20, 2026\n\nThe interception concludes a college career for Beck that started at Georgia in 2020 and featured five seasons including a redshirt campaign with the Bulldogs before he utilized his extra Covid-19 season to transfer to Miami.\n\nMiami didn't win the ACC with Beck at quarterback, but was granted a controversial berth in the College Football Playoff. Beck and the Hurricanes ultimately proved the selection committee correct by winning three playoff games to advance to Monday's championship game.\n\nThey had a chance at the end to upset a historic Indiana team that surged to the top of college football with dominant units on both sides of the ball following decades of irrelevance.\n\nIt's a lot to be proud of. But it's not likely to soothe the pain of how Monday's championship game was lost at the end.",

Indiana vs. Miami would be the 12th college football game he has attended since he was elected to his first term in 2016, and it would be the eighth he's attended as a sitting president.\n\nIn addition to attending the Army-Navy Game in December, Trump attended a Washington Commanders game against the Detroit Lions late in the NFL season and even made an appearance in the Fox broadcast booth. Last year, Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl.\n\nMiami, where Monday's game will be played, is a particularly convenient location for Trump because he has a residence at Mar-a-Lago in nearby Fort Lauderdale. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago on Friday and stayed there through the weekend, but he is set to return to the White House after the game.\n\nTrump is expected to attend the game with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who graduated from law school at Miami and represented Florida in the U.S. senate before being nominated to join Trump's cabinet.",

There’s also a wealth of present-day interviews with Saban and his wife, the legendary Ms. Terry Saban, whose own influence and impact played a massive role in Nick’s success as a coach and leader.”\n\nSaban retired two years ago from Alabama and now serves as an ESPN analyst – as well as a pitchman for Aflac and Vrbo.\n\n“With my coaching days behind me, Ms. Terry and I have been doing a lot of reflection and realized we were ready to tell our story,” Nick Saban said. “The team at Words + Pictures has encouraged me to really look back not just at my time at Alabama, but every stop along the way – and not just reflect on what happened but consider the process which made it happen.

There’s a lot to tell, and I’m excited to share it all.”\n\nIn addition to his national titles, Saban’s football programs produced four Heisman Trophy winners and innumerable NFL stars. ESPN says the series will include “more than 30 hours of interviews with Saban, and more than 80 interviews with former players, assistant coaches, rivals, family, friends, and observers, the series offers a rare look at how he became the most successful and influential figure that the game of college football has ever known.”\n\n“There will never be another Nick Saban,” observed Connor Schell, CEO of Words + Pictures. “He’s a football genius, a singular leader, and a true icon who has done more than anyone to shape the modern game of college football and the culture around it. When you work with Coach Saban, you’re constantly reminded how every small detail matters and, in his case, that attention to detail and process has added up to an incredible journey and legacy. Working with Coach Saban and Ms. Terry has been a tremendous experience, and we can’t wait to share their story with the world.”\n\nESPN says the premiere date and full rollout plans for the series will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Grammys, Tonys & More",

The Commodores, meanwhile, lost by 16 on the road against Texas and fell 98-94 at home to reigning national champion Florida.\n\nNo. 1 Arizona continued its perfect start to the season, moving to 18-0 with wins against rival Arizona State and at UCF.

That is the fun part.\n\nMORE CFP CHAMPIONSHIP GAME NEWS:\n\nExpert prediction of Indiana-Miami final\n\nCurt Cignetti's past meets his future in semis\n\nRoster breakdown: Who has more blue-chippers?\n\nWhy Miami gets to keep all CFP revenue\n\nIs Indiana better than Joe Burrow-led LSU?\n\nMiami's run has a March Madness feel\n\nWhy would we doubt Curt Cignetti? The Hoosiers will have heavy losses to the 2026 NFL Draft – including potential No. 1 pick Fernando Mendoza – but Indiana will combine returners such as receiver Charlie Becker and defensive tackle Rolijah Hardy with another strong portal class. TCU quarterback Josh Hoover (3,472 yards, 29 TDs, 13 INTs), Boston College running back Turbo Richard (749 yards, 9 TDs), Michigan State receiver Nick Marsh (662 yards, 6 TDs) and Kansas State edge rusher Tobi Osunsanmi (4 sacks) lead the changes. Indiana had a top-25 recruiting class, too. Ohio State and USC visit Memorial Stadium this year.\n\nMORE: Curt Cignetti's past met its future during College Football Playoff\n\nOhio State coach Ryan Day still has yet to name a new offensive coordinator after Brian Hartline left for South Florida. Defensive coordinator Matt Patricia is back to run what will be a re-tooled defense led by defensive lineman Kenyatta Jackson Jr.  Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin (3,610 yards, 32 TDs, 8 INTs), running back Bo Jackson (1,090 yards, 6 TDs) and receiver Jeremiah Smith (1,243 yards, 12 TDs) return on offense. Five-star freshman Chris Henry Jr. also should make an instant impact. The schedule is high level with road trips to Texas, Iowa, USC and Indiana and home games against Oregon and Michigan.\n\nThe Bulldogs won back-to-back SEC championships under coach Kirby Smart – and quarterback Gunner Stockton returns after a solid first season as a starter. Tackle Monroe Freeling and linebacker CJ Allen declared for the NFL Draft, but running back Nate Frazier (947 yards, 6 TDs) and tackle Earnest Greene are back. Linebacker Raylen Wilson and safety KJ Bolden will be anchors for a solid defense. Road trips to Alabama (Oct. 10) and Ole Miss (Nov. 7) are the marquee games on the schedule.\n\nMORE: Transfer portal winners and losers\n\nArch Manning returns at quarterback, and so does the preseason hype. He will have a loaded group of receivers with Ryan Wingo, Emmett Mosley V and Auburn transfer Cam Coleman – who had 13 TD receptions the last two seasons. Arizona State transfer running back Raleek Brown (1,141 yards, 4) and NC State transfer back  offset Hollywood Smothers (939 yards, 6 TDs) the loss of leading rusher Tre Wisner. Will the Longhorns' offensive line be better? They nabbed Wake Forest's starting left tackle Melvin Siani just before the portal closed. Pitt linebacker Rasheem Biles and Florida State linebacker Justin Cryer add to the defense – which welcomes the return of defensive coordinator Will Muschamp. The Longhorns have a return home game against Ohio State (Sept. 12), and the SEC schedule does not offer many breaks.\n\nHow will the Irish respond to this year's playoff snub under coach Marcus Freeman, who is 43-12 since taking over as head coach? Quarterback CJ Carr – who had 2,751 yards, 24 TDs and six interceptions – is a Heisman Trophy contender. Running back Aneyas Williams and receivers Jaden Greathouse and Jordan Faison should work behind an experienced offensive line. Ohio State transfer wide receiver Quincy Porter is a nice addition. All-American cornerback Leonard Moore is back along with senior linebacker Drayk Bowen. Notre Dame opens with Wisconsin (Sept. 6) at Lambeau Field, and the home matchup with Miami (Nov. 7) will be huge.\n\nMORE: Marcus Freeman choosing ND shows college sports aren't doomed\n\nDante Moore (3,565 yards, 30 TDs, 10 INTs) returns at starting quarterback for the Ducks, and Nebraska transfer Dylan Raiola also is in the QB room. That's a fantastic start for coach Dan Lanning, who replaces coordinators Will Stein and Tosh Lupoi with Drew Mehringer and Chris Hampton. The defense added Minnesota safety Koi Perich – one of the most-exciting players in college football. The Ducks have settled in the Big Ten as an every-year contender, and the schedule features matchups against Ohio State, Michigan and USC.\n\nTexas Tech isn't done yet after making its first CFP appearance under Joey McGuire. The Red Raiders landed Cincinnati quarterback Brendan Sorsby – who had 2,800 passing yards, 28 TDs and seven interceptions. Auburn transfer Malcolm Simmons averaged 18.3 yards per catch. The defense loses impact players such as Jacob Rodriguez, David Bailey and Lee Hunter – so there is work to do to replicate that dominance from 2025. San Diego State edge rusher Trey White – who had 19.5 sacks the last two seasons – and Kansas State transfer Austin Romaine – who has 184 career tackles – should help.\n\nMORE: Brendan Sorsby tops SN's transfer portal QB rankings\n\nThe Hurricanes enjoyed the long-awaited break-through to a CFP championship game under Mario Cristobal, but there will likely be heavy losses from a veteran roster starting at quarterback with Carson Beck. Miami stole Darian Mensah away from Duke just before the CFP championship game. Receiver Malachi Toney and defensive tackle Justin Scott are back – but there will be some interesting roster decisions after the CFP championship game.\n\nCan Brent Venables get Oklahoma back to the College Football Playoff? Quarterback John Mateer, receiver Isaiah Sategna and leading tackler Kip Lewis are returning, but 26 players have entered the portal. Texas receiver Parker Livingstone is a solid pickup, and Michigan linebacker Cole Sullivan adds to a defense that also returns defensive tackle David Stone, Peyton Bowen and Eli Bowen. Oklahoma plays at Michigan (Sept. 12) and Georgia (Sept. 26) in the first month.\n\nHow will Pete Golding navigate his first full season as head coach? Dynamic quarterback Trinidad Chambliss is suing the NCAA to be eligible for another season. If Chambliss is denied, then Auburn transfer quarterback Deuce Knight would likely be the starter. Running back Kewan Lacy (1,567 yards, 24 TDs) is back, and the Rebels did not have a massive exodus in the portal. LSU visits Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on Sept. 19 in Lane Kiffin's return.\n\nThe Cougars are 23-4 the last two seasons. Quarterback Bear Bachmeier and Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year LJ Martin are back from a team that was on the cusp of the College Football Playoff, but the Cougars will have to replace receiver Chase Roberts and BYU added four tackles – including USC's Walker Lyons – via the transfer portal. Linebacker Isaiah Glasker and safety Faleatu Satuala are the key returners on defense. Utah and Notre Dame are the marquee games on the schedule.\n\nThis will be a telling third year for Kalen DeBoer. Ty Simpson declared for the NFL Draft, meaning the quarterback competition between Austin Mack and Keelon Russell is front and center. The Crimson Tide have 20 players who left via the transfer portal, and running back Daniel Hill and receiver Ryan Williams are key returners – but the offense line will need to be rebuilt again. Safety Brady Hubbard is back on defense. Early-season home games against Florida State (Sept. 19) and Georgia (Oct. 10) will be a good gauge for where the Crimson Tide stand.\n\nThird-year coach Mike Elko can build off a CFP appearance. Quarterback Marcel Reed ranked fifth in the SEC with 3,169 passing yards. Reuben Owens III returns and will take on a lead role at running back, and Alabama transfer receiver Isaiah Horton is a key addition. The defense will have to replace the production from All-American Cashius Howell – and the schedule is tougher this time with road trips to LSU (Sept. 26), Alabama (Oct. 24) and Oklahoma (Nov. 24) before the home finale against Texas (Nov. 27).\n\nThe Trojans are 16-10 since joining the Big Ten, and this is another prove-it year for Lincoln Riley. Quarterback Jayden Maiava returns. He ranked fourth in the FBS with 3,711 passing yards. The Trojans also brought in the top recruiting class in the country. Defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn left for Penn State, however, and the Trojans lost 20 players in the transfer portal. Trips to Indiana and Penn State and home games against Ohio State and Oregon are the highlights.\n\nMorgan Scalley takes over for longtime coach Kyle Whittingham, and the Utes should be right back in the mix in the Big 12 race. Quarterbacks Devin Damper and Byrd Ficklin both return, and leading rusher Wayshawn Parker (981 yards, 6 TDs) is back. Safety Tao Johnson is a top returner on defense. Utah closed the season with six straight victories and averaged 46.5 points per game. Will that momentum carrry over with Scalley?\n\nWhittingham takes over at Michigan after Sherrone Moore was fired. New offensive coordinator Jason Beck will get to work with quarterback Bryce Underwood, who had 2,418 yards, 11 TDs and nine interceptions as a freshman. Jordan Marshall and five-star freshman Savion Hiter from a strong backfield, and Texas transfer Jamie Ffrench adds to the receiver room. Utah edge rusher John Henry Daley – who had 11.5 sacks – is a portal prize. The Wolverines play Oklahoma on Sept. 12 and face Indiana, Oregon and Ohio State in Big Ten play.\n\nHow will Lane Kiffin fare in Year 1 at LSU? The “Portal King” reeled in Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt and nine receivers via the transfer portal. Running back Caden Durham also is back. Linebacker Whit Weeks returns to what should be a healthier defense, and Boise State safety Ty Benefield will be a star in this defense.  September features the home opener at Clemson (Sept. 5), Kiffin's return to Ole Miss (Sept. 19) and a home game against Texas A&M (Sept. 26).\n\nPenn State hired Matt Campbell, and 22 players from Iowa State followed him to Happy Valley, including veteran quarterback Rocco Becht (2,584 yards, 16 TDs, 9 INTs). It's an overhaul at almost every position, and the running back room features Iowa State's Carson Hansen and Ohio State transfer James Peoples. We trust Campbell, but this feels like a transition season despite a friendly schedule that does not include Indiana, Ohio State or Oregon.\n\nThis could be Jeff Brohm's best team if Ohio State transfer Lincoln Kienholz takes command of the starting quarterback job. Running backs Isaac Brown (884 yards, 7 TDs) and Keyjuan Brown (704 yards, 6 TDs) are back, and edge rusher Clev Lubin (8.5 sacks, 13.5 TFLs) also returns. Brohm has 27 players coming in via the portal, including Vanderbilt receiver Tre Richardson (806 yards, 7 TDs). The Cardinals have a showcase opener against Ole Miss (Sept. 5) at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nIowa is in its customary spot under long-time coach Kirk Ferentz in these rankings. Wake Forest transfer Jeremy Hecklinski and Hank Brown will battle for the starting QB job. Kamari Moulton returns at running back, and Kade Pieper will anchor the offensive line. Zach Lutmer (71 tackles, 3 INTs) leads the defense. Iowa State, Ohio State, Nebraska and Wisconsin all visit Kinnick Stadium. The Hawkeyes have finished between No. 16 and No. 25 six of the last eight seasons.\n\nThe Cougars are a legit Big 12 sleeper contender under coach Willie Fritz. Quarterback Conner Weigman, Oregon transfer running back Makhi Hughes and receiver Amare Thomas – who had 966 yards and 12 TDs – lead the offense. Five-star quarterback Keisean Henderson could get opportunities too. Tulane guard Shadre Hurst – a second-team SN All-America pick – beefs up the offensive line. The defense has to replace its top two tacklers. A road trip to Texas Tech could be the best game on the Big 12 schedule.\n\nThe Illini are 19-7 the last two seasons under Bret Bielema. Luke Altmyer is gone, and East Carolina transfer Katin Houser is a solid replacement. A supporting cast of running back Caa'Lil Valentine (614 yards, 4 TDs) and receivers Collin Dixon (548 yards, 5 TDs) and Hudson Clement (454 yards, 3 TDs) is back. The defense will have to replace the production left by edge rusher Gabe Jacas. Illinois faces Duke (Sept. 12) early, and the Big Ten schedule features matchups against Oregon and at Ohio State.\n\nSMU is 20-7 with a CFP appearance under Rhett Lashlee since joining the ACC. Quarterback Kevin Jennings returns for his senior season. The Mustangs picked up East Carolina receiver Yanick Smith (583 yards, 5 TDs) via the portal. SMU plays at Notre Dame, and the conference schedule is favorable outside of a trip to Louisville. The Mustangs will be right back in the ACC championship hunt.\n\nDemond Williams (3,065 passing yards, 25 TDs, 8 INTs) is returning at quarterback for Washington after a brief interlude with LSU. He also had 611 rushing yards and six TDs. Oregon running back Jayden Limar is a portal find who replaces Adam Mohamed, who transferred to Cal. Coach Jedd Fisch reeled in a top-10 recruiting class, too. Washington has home games with Indiana and Penn State and road tests at Oregon and USC.\n\nWill Eddie Robinson Coach of the year Clark Lea capitalize on the momentum created by Diego Pavia and All-American tight end Eli Stowers in 2025? Five-star freshman quarterback Jared Curtis is up next, and the Commodores added 16 players via the transfer portal. Clemson safety Ricardo Jones joins CJ Heard in the secondary, and linebacker Bryan Longwell – who has 70 tackles – also returns. The Commodores won't surprise anybody this year – and the matchups with Georgia (Oct. 3) and Alabama (Nov. 14) will tell the tale.\n\nManny Diaz led the Blue Devils to an ACC championship this season, but losing Mensah is a huge blow, especially with backup Henry Belin IV also gone. Running back Nate Sheppard – who had 1,132 yards and 11 TDs – also returns. Duke added 14 players via the transfer portal. The Blue Devils should be one of the best offenses in the ACC, and an early-season game at Illinois (Sept. 12) is a good barometer for success.\n\nDo you believe James Franklin can guide a quick turn-around at Virginia Tech? He flipped several Nittany Lions' recruits and brought 12 Penn State players from the transfer portal, and that includes quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer. This might be a year early, especially with a schedule that includes road trips to Clemson, SMU and Miami.",

    "fullText": "Miami will be playing for a national championship on its home field Monday night as it squares off against the Indiana Hoosiers in Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nThe Hurricanes are one of the most dominant college football programs of the last 50 years, and they are looking to add their sixth national title in this game. However, to an entire generation of college football fans, Miami's appearance in a CFP title game is anything but typical.\n\nThe national title drought for the Hurricanes has lasted 24 years, as they last claimed a trophy during the 2001 season. Miami hasn't even played for a national title since the 2002 season — in which it lost to Ohio State in overtime on a now-infamous pass interference penalty.\n\nThe decades since have not been kind to the Hurricanes. They won 11 games the following year in 2003, but that was the last double-digit win total until a 10-win season under Mark Richt in 2017. After that, the 'Canes didn't reach double-digit wins again until 2024 under Mario Cristobal, who has now won 23 games over the last two campaigns.\n\nMiami football is inarguably \"back,\" and a win over the Hoosiers to claim its sixth national championship would only further solidify that fact.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: When was Miami football's last national championship appearance?",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers will face the No. 10 Miami Hurricanes for a chance at football immortality. On Monday night, millions will watch the crimson of the Hoosiers clash with the all-white Hurricanes.\n\nAlthough the game is played at Miami's home turf, Hard Rock Stadium, the Hurricanes are technically the away team.\n\nThere are many significant storylines entering this game, but none more unique than the fact that this year's National Championship game will mark the first time in history that both schools are Adidas-branded.\n\nThis year's national championship is the first all-Adidas matchup in the title game.\n\nIt will be the first Adidas branded team to win a national title since Tennessee in 1998. pic.twitter.com/hnq9di2V4r\n\n— The Next Round (@NextRoundLive) January 13, 2026\n\nNo matter the outcome, this will be the first Adidas-branded school to win a national title since 1998, when the Tennessee Volunteers won it all.\n\nThe Sporting News has all you need to know about Indiana and Miami's uniform threads for the 2026 CFP National Championship game.\n\nMORE CFP CHAMPIONSHIP GAME NEWS:\n\nExpert prediction of Indiana-Miami final\n\nCurt Cignetti's past meets his future in semis\n\nRoster breakdown: Who has more blue-chippers?\n\nIs Indiana better than Joe Burrow-led LSU?\n\nMiami's run has a March Madness feel\n\nWhile the Hoosiers team and fanbase will have to travel to Miami, they have been deemed the home team.

In 2024, Indiana extended their partnership with Adidas, which will run until 2034.\n\nIt might be confusing, but even though the Hurricanes will be playing at home, they have been designated the away team.

The significance of this for those who are superstitious, Miami has not lost a game this season in these uniforms. In fact, they are 5-0 on the season and wore the same all-whites in their playoff wins over Texas A&M and Ohio State.\n\nDespite this being an \"away\" game, it will feel anything but that for the Hurricanes. The university put out a statement to those planning on attending, encouraging the Hurricanes faithful to wear orange.\n\nThis will undoubtedly produce a striking contrast with the all-white uniforms on the field.",

    "description": "Eryn Bostwick said that her high student-loan payments have prevented her from moving forward with IVF treatment.",
    "fullText": "College was always the goal for Eryn Bostwick.\n\nAs a first-generation college student, Bostwick, 37, said her parents wanted to ensure she had the opportunities they didn't have, and they believed that earning a college degree would provide her with financial stability.\n\nBostwick's parents weren't wrong — data show that a four-year college degree leads to higher earnings than a high school diploma. However, to accomplish that goal, Bostwick had to take out student loans and Pell grants. She said she wasn't fully aware of the long-term ramifications of the debt.\n\nShe now has just over $55,000 in student loan debt, which she accrued while pursuing a bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. at public universities with the goal of becoming a college professor. As a result, she's put off major life decisions, like adding to her family.\n\n\"I've always been very careful about when I would feel comfortable bringing a child into this world,\" Bostwick told Business Insider.\n\nIn vitro fertilization, or IVF, was the only way Bostwick could have a child due to existing medical conditions. While Bostwick and her husband were able to afford the initial rounds of treatments, Bostwick left her full-time job in Texas to move back to Ohio to be closer to family, and she was unable to find a job that paid enough to cover IVF, student-loan payments, and her other expenses.\n\nShe now works as a part-time teacher at two different colleges, with an income in the low five figures.\n\n\"Could we go through IVF? Sure, but then we wouldn't be able to afford actually having a child,\" Bostwick said. \"It just felt like there's too much hanging over our heads.\"\n\nMany student-loan borrowers have told Business Insider that they've had to put off major life decisions, like having children, retiring, or purchasing a home, due to their high debt loads. The year ahead could bring even more financial strain to borrowers — President Donald Trump's Education Department will begin implementing a repayment overhaul in July, which includes new repayment plans with higher monthly payments.\n\nThe uncertainty of what's to come in the student-loan industry has borrowers like Bostwick wary of making major life decisions that could become significant financial burdens.\n\n\"It feels like any power was taken from me, all because of a decision I made when I was 18 years old that I didn't completely comprehend, that my parents didn't completely comprehend, that I felt was necessary in order to create this better life for myself,\" Bostwick said. \"And now it's really just become a noose around my neck.\"\n\nBostwick said she has 71 qualifying payments toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years, or 120 qualifying payments.\n\nHowever, she is also enrolled in the SAVE plan, created by former President Joe Biden and intended to provide borrowers with cheaper monthly payments and a shorter timeline to debt relief. Borrowers on the plan have been in forbearance since July 2024 due to litigation, meaning that PSLF borrowers have not been receiving credit toward forgiveness during that period.\n\nAdditionally, Trump's administration announced a proposed settlement to eliminate the plan. If a court approves the settlement, SAVE borrowers would have a limited time to enroll in a new income-driven repayment plan with higher payments.\n\n\"The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement alongside the announcement of the proposed settlement.\n\nIt's not that simple, Bostwick said. Many of the students she teaches are first-generation, like herself, and they pursued higher education because they were told it's the best way to achieve upward mobility and financial stability. Given her experience with student debt, Bostwick said she \"makes it her mission\" to ensure her students are aware of the implications of taking out loans, and that a degree isn't always necessary to pursue certain career paths.\n\n\"I've never once heard somebody say they don't want to be able to take out loans and never pay them back,\" Bostwick said. \"They want to be able to pay their loans back, but the current system makes it nearly impossible.\"\n\nTrump's Department of Education said it's working to improve the system. It just concluded negotiations on proposals aimed at preventing borrowers from taking out unaffordable debt, and it has previously said that its changes to repayment are aimed at reducing complexity in the student-loan industry.\n\nBostwick said she isn't getting her hopes up.\n\n\"I just feel like I've constantly been trying to keep my head above the water, and it's never really been good enough,\" she said. \"It's unbelievably frustrating.\"\n\nHave a story to share?

    "fullText": "The Miami Hurricanes head into the College Football Playoff national championship game with some pretty good news on the injury front. Elija Lofton has been ruled out, and Damari Brown appears to be trending towards a game time decision, but every other contributor avoided being on the availability report and appears good to go, including Ahmad Moten, Sr., Akheem Mesidor, and OJ Frederique.\n\nHowever, thanks to college football’s own controversial rule, the Hurricanes’ defense will still have to try to hold the Indiana Hoosiers in check without one of their most important players – starting cornerback Xavier Lucas.\n\nLucas was flagged for targeting in the second half of Miami’s 31-27 win over Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl. He hit Ole Miss WR Cayden Lee with his shoulder, but the contact occurred to Lee’s head, and Lucas was sent to the showers.\n\nIt’s not being talked about enough how ridiculous it is that Xavier Lucas has to sit out the first half of the title game because he tried to tackle the lower body of a receiver being led into him by his QB as the WR twisted his body down into his helmet.pic.twitter.com/oT3F5l3lnr\n\n— David Furones (@DavidFurones_) January 16, 2026\n\nBased on the NCAA’s rule, Lucas is suspended for the first half of Monday night’s clash with the Indiana Hoosiers. It feels like a heavy and unfair penalty because it is, particularly given it wasn’t an intentional and egregious hit. At some point as a defender, you have to commit to going into a hit, and a wide receiver’s body position changes in a millisecond, and some guys just miss. This was an example of exactly that. Now, as a result of playing football, Lucas will be watching with his helmet in his hand for the first 30 minutes.\n\nMario Cristobal was asked about the hit on Sunday morning at his joint press conference with Indiana’s Curt Cignetti, and he feels as though the rule should be revisited.\n\n“Certainly do. We feel it was unjustly administered, and now it impacts the last game of the season. We do have the ability, again, as an officiating crew and the powers that be to revisit that to give every team due process and their best ability to compete in this game.“\n\nIndiana’s offense is a handful, with Omar Cooper, Jr. Elijah Sarratt, and Charlie Becker forming a terrific trio of pass catchers. Miami is being severely hamstrung by this rule. Hopefully for Miami’s sakes, they can continue to control the game on offense early on with long, sustained drives and keep Indiana’s offense on the sideline.\n\nBecause if they don’t, an already extremely tough offense will be even tougher for the Hurricanes to stop. And on the game’s biggest stage, that’s a real shame.",

In the aftermath of the killing, Aminian's mother had to look through piles of bloodied corpses to find her daughter's body.  More than a week after she was killed, Aminian's relatives say they still have not held a funeral for the young Kurdish woman who was studying fashion in Tehran, the capital.",
    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Robina Aminian's family believes the college student was killed by a bullet fired by Iranian security forces straight into the back of her head.\n\nBut her death in the nationwide protests that challenged the Islamic Republic's theocracy was only the start of the family's agony. In the aftermath of the killing, Aminian's mother had to look through piles of bloodied corpses to find her daughter's body. Then the family raced to escape authorities who might demand payment to release the body and buried her hastily in an unmarked roadside pit.\n\nTheir odyssey reflects the trail of anguish left by Iran's deadly assault on protesters, which has led to desperate relatives searching overflowing morgues across the country. For families, the loss of loved ones is compounded by the difficulty they face in grieving and giving the dead a dignified sendoff.\n\nMore than a week after she was killed, Aminian's relatives say they still have not held a funeral for the young Kurdish woman who was studying fashion in Tehran, the capital.\n\n“She wanted a bright future for herself,” her uncle, Nezar Minoei, said from Oslo. “But unfortunately, the future has been stolen from her.”\n\nDetails about what happened to Aminian are scant. After her death, her mother called relatives outside the country, recounting what she learned from Aminian's friends, who were present when she was killed.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke to three relatives, who all described similar details from the mother's account. An Oslo-based human rights organization, Iran Human Rights, released a report about her killing, citing witness testimony. They verified there was a shooting on the night of Jan. 8 around the campus of the Shariati Technical and Vocational College for Girls.\n\nWith communications greatly limited in Iran, the AP has been unable to independently confirm the family’s account or the wounds to Aminian’s body or to verify its location. The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York has declined to comment.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which relies on a network of activists on the ground and has been accurate during previous unrest in Iran, said at least 3,090 people have been killed. Iran's government has not offered any overall casualties figures.\n\nEverything that Aminian's relatives abroad know about her death comes from a brief phone call her mother was able to make Jan. 10 to relatives in Oslo.\n\nThey say the mother, Amina Norei, got a call Jan. 8 from Aminian’s friends, who said she had been gunned down by security forces. The friends told Norei they were walking away from campus in Tehran after dark when they saw a protest and joined in.\n\nA bullet fired by security forces struck the back of Aminian’s head, her friends told the mother.\n\nVideos shared on social media, verified by the AP, and statements by rights groups, doctors and survivors, describe Iranian agents using rifles and shotguns to disperse protesters across the country.\n\nIran's theocracy, which has used violence in previous rounds of unrest, increasingly refers to demonstrators as “terrorists.\" Authorities allege some demonstrators were armed, but there are no allegations that anyone was armed in Aminian's vicinity at the time of her death.\n\nAminian’s relatives said she was not an activist or involved in politics.\n\nAminian's mother was in Kermanshah, a western city in the Kurdish region of Iran nearly 460 kilometers (230 miles) from Tehran, when she learned about her daughter's death.\n\nShe rushed to Tehran in the middle of the night, she told family. Norei recalled to them how she began unzipping body bag after body bag, looking for Aminian.\n\n“She looked through so many beautiful faces, trying to find her girl,\" Hali Norei, Amnian's aunt, said from Oslo. ”And what is so horrifying for me is imagining what my sister feels as she searches for her daughter.\"\n\nMany other Iranian families are searching overflowing morgues for loved ones, according to rights group Amnesty International. Bodies have piled up in trucks, freight containers and warehouses, the group said.\n\nWhen Norei found her daughter, she was joined by her husband, daughter and son, and the family rushed out with the body, fearing authorities would block their way and insist on a payment to release the corpse, according to Minoei, Aminian’s uncle.\n\n“She actually stole the body,” Minoei said.\n\nIn a statement to the AP, the New York City-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said it has received multiple accounts of intelligence forces demanding money from families in exchange for the return of protesters' bodies. The group called the levies “a well-known, standard practice” in Iran to scare families into not publicly mourning their dead.\n\nOther families reported to the center that they were forced to sign papers falsely declaring that their dead relatives were members of the security forces in order to retrieve the bodies.\n\nIranian state television recently aired a statement saying mortuary and burial services were free, after repeated allegations of the practice.\n\nMinoei said the mother told him that she and her oldest daughter spent the seven-hour ride back to Kermanshah clutching the body in the backseat, blood and tears staining their clothes. When they got home, the mother told him, security forces had surrounded their house.\n\nAmina Norei told her family they had only one option: They drove out of town and dug a pit on the side of the road. They placed the body inside and drove away. Aminian is still believed to be buried there, in an unmarked grave.\n\nRelatives said they have not heard from Amina Norei or other relatives in Iran since Sunday.\n\nJulia Frankel reported from Jerusalem.",

    "fullText": "As we hit the heart of the college basketball season, I’ll be bringing you a moneyline parlay every Saturday for what’s always a stacked slate of NCAA hoops action.\n\nToday, I’m backing undefeated Nebraska, an SMU squad that remains perfect at home, and Arkansas on the road.\n\nBest of all, this parlay has been BOOSTED by our friends at bet365! Here are my college basketball picks for January 17!\n\nTime: 4:00 p.m. ET\nLocation: Evanston, IL\nTV: Big Ten Network\nPick: Nebraska (-245)\n\nThe 17-0 Nebraska Cornhuskers are one of just three unbeaten teams left in college hoops. The Huskers have beaten quality competition, owning five wins over Top-40 KenPom teams — including victories against No. 12 Michigan State and No. 5 Illinois.\n\nThey won’t go undefeated forever, but a Northwestern Wildcats team that has lost eight straight games against high-major opponents isn’t likely to be the one to trip them up.\n\nTime: 12:00 p.m. ET\nLocation: Dallas, TX\nTV: ESPN2\nPick: SMU (+120)\n\nThis sets up as a potential letdown and lookahead spot for the Virginia Cavaliers, who are coming off a big road win at Louisville and have a week off after this game. The Hoos rely heavily on the 3-point shot, which doesn’t always travel well.\n\nMeanwhile, the SMU Mustangs are a perfect 11-0 at home, most recently beating Virginia Tech on a last-second half-court shot Wednesday. SMU boasts elite guard play and held its own on the road at Duke last week despite missing star guard Boopie Miller (20.8 ppg, 7.1 apg).\n\nBack at home with Miller in the lineup, the Mustangs should be in a strong position to get the job done against UVA.\n\nTime: 4:00 p.m. ET\nLocation: Athens, GA\nTV: ESPN2\nPick: Arkansas (+105)\n\nThe No. 21-ranked Georgia Bulldogs have been an offensive juggernaut, leading the nation at 96.4 points per game. That said, I’m not sold on Georgia’s resume, as the Bulldogs rank 116th in strength of schedule and are 0-2 in Quad 1 games.\n\nMeanwhile, the No. 17 Arkansas Razorbacks have faced the 27th-toughest schedule and are 3-4 in Quad 1 contests. Arkansas also boasts the more talented roster and the coaching edge with John Calipari on the sideline.\n\nThat’s enough for me to back the Razorbacks as short road dogs.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

That all starts on Saturday, as Jake Diebler’s Buckeyes welcome Mick Cronin’s UCLA Bruins (12-5, 4-2) to Columbus.\n\nBoth Ohio State and UCLA have feasted on the bottom of the Big Ten so far this year, with neither team beating a fellow Big Ten team that’s in the top half of the conference standings. For Ohio State, Saturday’s game is a Quad-2 opportunity, for UCLA, it’s a Quad-1 game.\n\nOhio State will be without senior forward Brandon Noel, while senior center Christoph Tilly will likely be listed as questionable after being treated for a head injury suffered last weekend at Washington. Ohio State’s newest player, former Penn State forward Puff Johnson, may be on the bench Saturday, but is not expected to suit up one day after being ruled eligible by a court in Franklin County.\n\nFollowing Saturday’s game, Ohio state will face Minnesota at home, Michigan on the road, and Penn State at home.\n\nUCLA will likely be without guard Skyy Clark, who averages 13.5 points per game and is sooting 48.6% from three this season, as he recovers from a hamstring injury.\n\nConnect with Connor: \nTwitter: @lemons_connor",

    "fullText": "Josh Pate declares whether Big Ten has overtaken SEC in college football moving forward originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf it were up to college football podcaster and analyst Josh Pate, the Big Ten-SEC debate as to which conference holds the cards isn't even close.\n\nPate said on a recent edition of \"Josh Pate's College Football Show\" that the Big Ten deserves the same respect, if not more, than the SEC in this current era of college football.\n\n“The SEC is lagging behind the Big Ten, at the top,\" Pate said. \"I would even venture to suggest the middle-tier now is at least comparable if not slightly lagging behind. That’s probably where my perception has changed of late, moreso than at the top. So I’m not beating that drum.”\n\nPate made an interesting follow-up point: it doesn't even matter that the Indiana Hoosiers are currently the class of the league. It's the psychological framework about what makes those players more polished than those from the SEC. And it's greater than just mental and physical toughness, Pate said.\n\nMore: Todd McShay passionately defends Dante Moore's decision to return to Oregon Ducks\n\n“Maybe the average Big Ten player is wired a little bit differently, maybe they focus a little more on the football aspect, the mean-and-potatoes aspect of football, instead of the more highlight-ish, branding aspect of football,” Pate said.\n\nThat \"wired\" approach is the most unique part. It can't be taught. It can't be studied.\n\n“If you think that’s ridiculous, it’s because it is,” Pate said. “But that’s been standard practice in the SEC for awhile. And I don’t find it to be the case in the Big Ten.”\n\nMore: Inside the special moment Indiana's Curt Cignetti will never forget\n\nWhether the narrative returns in favor of the SEC is unclear, but right now, the Big Ten can keep chasing excellence.\n\nEntering Monday night's game, a potential Hoosiers victory over the Miami Hurricanes may further validate Pate's argument while the SEC watches from the sidelines.\n\nWhat Dylan Raiola's commitment to Oregon Ducks signals for Dante Moore's NFL future\n\nCollege football analyst bashes SEC in defense of Big Ten as Indiana clinches title berth\n\nTodd McShay shares massive advice for Oregon QB Dante Moore on heels of NFL Draft decision\n\nIndiana QB Fernando Mendoza gets massive kudos from ex-NFL coach with interesting pro comp",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

    "fullText": "College stars in America have been having a gala time since Name, Image, and Likeness rights came into effect. It allows them to capitalize on their popularity financially, something superstars of the past, including Michael Jordan and LeBron James, were not able to do at the collegiate level. But, as with most things, the change has also had a negative impact on the sport, according to Paul Pierce for one.\n\nThe NBA legend feels that basketball in college has become far less competitive. The drive to get to the top, not just because they’re succeeding professionally, but also monetarily, seems to have gone.\n\nPierce feels budding talents in the NBA have become complacent, because from what they earn in college, they can easily take care of their families. The question is, could this affect the quality of the NBA in the future?\n\nThe ex-Boston Celticsman acknowledged that the NBA is not in trouble just yet. “This year, it’s a great class,” he said on Derrick White‘s podcast. “I think there’s some ballers out there in college. They look good…”\n\n*“But then, you look at some [and] it’s like damn, they don’t even care once they got that money now. You see certain players in high school that get to college now and you go like, what happened?”*\n\nWhite, adding on to what Pierce said, opined that the issue stems from kids growing up poor and suddenly having too much money in their hands in college. Before, it was about getting to the NBA to get that big paycheck. Now, if they do well in college, it’s not a necessity anymore.\n\nAnother problem that White pointed out was players jumping ship when they don’t like their stay in a particular college. “I don’t think the teams are as connected, like, in that culture. Now, I think it’s just random because, like transfer portal and all this is just going on.”\n\n“I think, money has something to do with it, but just, I think the culture is a little bit different now,” White concluded.\n\nPlayers who dream of making money would undoubtedly not care where they get it from. If college ball keeps them and their families relatively comfortable for the time being, its normal for most to take their foot off the pedal for a bit.\n\nPierce brought up a great point, describing how players like Stephen Curry, who did not grow up poor, still had that relentless drive to become a legend. He didn’t have NIL. But he had his father Dell Curry, a former NBA star, to back him. On the other hand, there were those like Ben Simmons, who were projected to be great, but earned their millions, and called it a day.\n\nBottom line, it depends on the mindset. Yes, NIL does influence certain things. But someone with a Curry-esque, or James-esque mentality, would never put their feet up in college.\n\nThe post “They Don’t Even Care”: Paul Pierce Questions if Money Is Ruining College Basketball appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Five days ago, Lane Kiffin and the LSU Tigers had zero quarterbacks. Now they have three intriguing players and one of the best rooms in college football.",
    "fullText": "Just last week, the LSU Tigers had no scholarship quarterbacks on the roster and fans started to freak out. Now, they have assembled one of the strongest rooms in the nation, with as clear a plan for the future as the transfer portal era allows.\n\nAfter picking up their third commit on Wednesday morning, Lane Kiffin is likely done configuring his group. Here is how the quarterback room will look for the 2026 season:\n\nAfter nearly two weeks of searching, meeting and striking out with a couple of options, the Tigers ended up landing what some considered to be the best quarterback in the transfer portal.\n\nLeavitt had some hopes of being a top selection in the upcoming NFL draft, but last year didn't really go as planned. The production was down and a lisfranc injury cut his season short.\n\nLSU has no worry about that dip on the field or that injury. The Tigers will hand Leavitt the most weapons he's had to work with before and Kiffin's teams have become one of the best at developing quarterbacks.\n\nLeavitt has completed 61.4% of his career passes for 4,652 yards and 36 touchdowns to 11 interceptions. He has also run the ball 196 times for 816 yards and 10 more scores. He will be a perfect fit for the Kiffin and Charlie Weis Jr. offense.\n\nLongstreet likely entered the portal with hopes of landing a starting job somewhere, but instead he will remain a backup for this season with the opportunity of learning under Leavitt and Kiffin for a year. Leaving Lincoln Riley isn't something that top quarterbacks are known to do, but this is not a bad spot, either.\n\nWith Leavitt likely heading to the draft next year, Longstreet will be in line to become the starter next season. He was a five-star quarterback in the 2025 class and will have four years of eligibility remaining.\n\nLongstreet is a freak athlete, combining great speed and a very strong arm. It'll be fun to see what kind of player he will be able to develop into.\n\nHe appeared in four games for the USC Trojans this season, completing 13 of his 15 pass attempts for 103 yards and a touchdown. He also ran the ball 11 times for 76 yards and two more scores.\n\nIt was assumed that he was the safety option in case Leavitt went elsewhere, but now LSU gets both. With Peyton Houston coming in as a top high school prospect next year, the Tigers could have their next three starters decided if the transfer portal doesn't break things up.\n\nClark was a three-star transfer and unranked prospect out of high school, but figures to be a top-end backup option. He is known for his cannon of an arm. Kiffin knows what he's doing with small-school, unsuspecting talent.\n\nThe former Elon Phoenix standout completed 56% of his passes last year for 2,321 yards and 18 touchdowns to eight interceptions. He added 189 carries for 614 yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO — Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman spoke with reporters Wednesday for the first time since the Irish were left out of the College Football Playoff.\n\nHe touched on multiple topics, including addressing some big additions through the transfer portal. Here are six things Freeman said:\n\nThe “Here Come the Irish” docuseries on Peacock recently showed the moment the Irish coaches and players found out that Alabama and Miami made the CFP over them.\n\nFreeman stared at the video screen with his mouth open. Players put their faces in their hands.\n\nFreeman said Wednesday that he thought the series properly captured the disappointment and confusion they felt. A month later, he said there’s still disappointment for the Irish, who had been ranked No. 9 or 10 up until the selection show. Miami, which will play Indiana in the national championship Monday, received the last spot in the 12-team CFP.\n\n“But you have to move forward, and that’s what we’ve done as a program,” Freeman said. “That’s what I’ve done as a leader. As I reminded the group in our team meeting on Sunday, it’s our responsibility to make sure we leave no doubt. We can’t blame it on somebody else. Although I may be confused about some of the criteria and the committee’s rankings and all those different things, it’s our job as we move forward to make sure we leave no doubt.”\n\nFreeman said he hasn’t second-guessed his team’s decision to skip a bowl game after being left out of the CFP. He said he was proud of how the captains made the decision and didn’t believe it was an emotional one.\n\nHe asked them again and again if they were sure about the decision.\n\n“Because I didn’t want them to regret it,” Freeman said. “And they were convicted in their decision, and I fully support them.”\n\nFreeman’s name has popped up a few times in this NFL hiring cycle. But he announced he was staying at Notre Dame on Dec. 29, when he posted on social media: “2026…run it back”\n\nFreeman noted that he always tells his players that the future is uncertain.\n\n“But everything I want and everything that I need personally can be achieved right here as a head coach of this program,” he said. “And so I hope this is something we have to address every year. I really do because it means we’re having a lot of success right here at Notre Dame.”\n\nFreeman said he has used discussions with NFL teams to gather information and learn how he can be a better coach. He said he didn’t know if an NFL job would interest him at some point in the future.\n\n“I don’t know enough about it,” he said.” Maybe sometime in the future, if it’s the right time and it’s what I think is right for me, then maybe I’ll pursue it. But I don’t love wasting time thinking about things that aren’t right in front of me, and so I don’t know what I will want in however much length of time from now. I know right now that I am as convicted and motivated to be the best head coach of the Notre Dame football program as I can be.”\n\nLast month, Notre Dame and USC put their 96-game rivalry series on pause because they couldn’t agree to the timing of the 2026 game. The Irish then scheduled BYU for a home-and-home series instead.\n\nFreeman said he believes the rivalry is “important for college football” and the athletic department leaders will work to get it back at some point. But he said the proposed timing wasn’t best for Notre Dame and its 2026 CFP pursuit.\n\n“I’m a competitive individual, right?” Freeman said. “And I want to go play anytime, anywhere, but at the same token, it’s important that I make decisions too that are best for the program. And to move a game that we were pretty sure was going to be Week 12 to Week 0 isn’t what’s best for our program. And they had to make decisions that were best for their program. I don’t blame them. They had to make decisions. We had to make decisions.”\n\nFreeman believes his family’s name was “dragged through the mud unnecessarily” over a recent interaction at a high school wrestling tournament.\n\nAn assistant high school wrestling coach, identified by the South Bend Tribune as Chris Fleeger, accused Freeman of battery at the event, saying Freeman pushed him with two hands. But the St. Joseph County prosecutor’s office said it determined through video evidence and interviews that no criminal battery occurred, and Freeman won’t be charged.\n\n“I was confident in this outcome because I know I did not intentionally touch anyone in a rude, angry or disrespectful way,” Freeman said. “I’m glad this matter has been thoroughly reviewed and resolved.”\n\nFreeman took issue of the initial reporting of the incident by the South Bend Tribune before all of the evidence was released.\n\nNotre Dame said in a statement Sunday that the wrestling coach verbally accosted Freeman’s son, Vinny, a senior who signed to wrestle at Cornell, and Freeman and his wife tried to remove their son from the situation.\n\n“I know I’m a public figure, and I understand the scrutiny that comes with that,” Freeman said. “That scrutiny should not extend to my children or any other child of a public figure.”\n\nThe Irish recently announced the additions of former Ohio State wide receivers Quincy Porter and Mylan Graham.\n\nPorter was the nation’s fifth-ranked wide receiver and the No. 1 player from New Jersey in the 2025 class. He had four catches for 59 yards in four games as an Ohio State freshman after missing some time with an injury.\n\nGraham, who was a five-star prospect and the nation’s fifth-ranked receiver in 2024, had six catches for 93 yards in 2025.\n\n“We knew a lot about them in the high school recruiting process, who they were, the type of players they are,” Freeman said. “And I’m glad we were able to get them.”\n\nNotre Dame also landed in the portal former Alabama edge rusher Keon Keeley, who was a five-star recruit ranked No. 2 in the 247Sports composite rankings in 2023. Keeley originally had committed to Notre Dame out of high school before flipping to Alabama.\n\nFreeman called it “a little delayed gratification.”\n\n“I’ve always believed Keon was a Notre Dame kid coming from his high school,” he said. “He’s such a unique individual. He’s a very talented football player. … When he came on his visit, I’m like, ‘Yep, it’s the same Keon we recruited a couple years ago.’ And he fits here, and I’m excited for his future.”\n\nFreeman said linebacker Drayk Bowen had surgery on the labrum in his hip, but he expects him to return in some capacity this spring.\n\nThe Irish expect linebacker Kyngstonn Viliamu-Asa to be back to full-go around the start of the 2026 season. He is recovering from an ACL injury.",

    "description": "Alabama's first Heisman Trophy winner and two of the most imposing defensive linemen in the sport's recent history got the nod among a group of 22 inductees.",
    "fullText": "Nick Saban was front and center of last year's College Football Hall of Fame class. He coached seven national championship teams, including six at Alabama.\n\nThe first of those title-winning Crimson Tide squads featured running back Mark Ingram, who will be enshrined among this year's group of 22 inductees.\n\nIngram headlines a 2026 class announced Wednesday, along with defensive linemen Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh. They starred at Pitt and Nebraska, respectively, before enjoying prolific NFL careers.\n\nHere's the complete list of 18 players and four coaches headed to the Hall in Atlanta.\n\nRB Jerry Azumah – University of New Hampshire (1995-98)\n\nRB Ki-Jana Carter – Penn State (1991-94)\n\nOT Bruce Collie – University of Texas at Arlington (1981-84)\n\nLB George Cumby – Oklahoma (1976-79)\n\nDT Aaron Donald – Pittsburgh (2010-13)\n\nWR/KR Marvin Harrison – Syracuse (1992-95)\n\nRB Garrison Hearst – Georgia (1990-92)\n\nDB Chris Hudson – Colorado (1991-94)\n\nRB Mark Ingram – Alabama (2008-10)\n\nC Olin Kreutz – Washington (1995-97)\n\nLB James Laurinaitis – Ohio State (2005-08)\n\nQB Jordan Lynch – Northern Illinois (2010-13)\n\nWR Herman Moore – Virginia (1988-90)\n\nCB Terence Newman – Kansas State (1999-2002)\n\nOG Bob Novogratz– United States Military Academy (1957-58)\n\nDT Ndamukong Suh – Nebraska (2006-09)\n\nWR Peter Warrick – Florida State (1996-99)\n\nJim Margraff – Johns Hopkins (1990-2018)\n\nChris Petersen – Boise State (2006-13); Washington (2014-19)\n\nKen Sparks – Carson-Newman University (1980-2016)\n\nIngram rushed for 1,658 yards and piled up 20 total touchdowns (17 rushing and three receiving) during the 2009 season. He became the first Alabama player to win the Heisman Trophy, and the Crimson Tide won the BCS national championship. He went on to play 12 seasons in the NFL.\n\nLong before Donald was a three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year, he was ACC Defensive Player of the Year and a whole lot more. In fact, he swept the sport's major defensive awards during his final college season in 2013, when he stacked 28.5 TFLs, 11 sacks and 4 forced fumbles.\n\nSuh went on to earn All-Pro honors five times as a defensive stalwart in the NFL during the 2010s. But first, his play made him a must-watch sensation at Nebraska. In 2008, he recorded two pick 6s, and he notched a receiving touchdown while lining up as a fullback. The next season, he amassed 85 total tackles, 20.5 TFLs and 12 sacks before collecting hardware as college football's top defensive player.\n\nWarrick overlapped with FSU's dominance in the '90s. During the two-time first-team All-American receiver's four seasons with the Seminoles, they were a mainstay at the top of the national polls. He mounted 1,232 receiving yards and 13 total touchdowns in 1998 and then helped FSU win it all in 1999.\n\nHarrison is a Pro Football of Famer, too. He became a household name with the Indianapolis Colts. Before that, however, he developed at Syracuse, where he eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards and tallied two punt return touchdowns in 1995.\n\nPatterson was a TCU staple. He coached the Horned Frogs for 22 seasons, compiling a 181-79 record along the way. He guided them to 11 bowl victories — including a win in the Rose Bowl during the 2010 season another in the Peach Bowl during the 2014 season — and helped them navigate their transitions from Conference USA to the Mountain West and then to the Big 12.\n\nSimilarly, Petersen helped transform Boise State into the football power that it is today. He's the winningest-coach in the Broncos' history. From 2006-13, he went 92-12. In that span, he piloted Boise State to a pair of Fiesta Bowl victories: Those came in 2006 and 2009, each capping undefeated seasons and top-five finishes in the AP Poll. He later led Washington to three straight double-digit-win seasons from 2016-18, picking up a pair of Pac-12 titles in the process.",

The Hoosiers, in the middle of a playoff run, have seen just five portal entries while adding 15 players.\n\nThat might, and probably will, change with time as more members of the roster enter the portal and other teams keep putting classes together, but it’s a strong performance for a program that’s had more on its plate than all but one other these past few weeks.\n\nFormer TCU quarterback Josh Hoover, former Michigan State wide receiver Nick Marsh and former Wisconsin offensive lineman Joe Brunner lead the talent rankings for Indiana’s class as of this writing.",

    "fullText": "The 2025 college football season concludes on Monday night in Miami Gardens, Florida with the College Football Playoff National Championship Game. After an incredible regular season, an exciting bowl season, and a remarkable playoff, everything comes down to one final game to crown a champion.\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes and the Indiana Hoosiers will kick off at 6:30 p.m. CT at Hard Rock Stadium on January 19th, and a champion will be decided in Year 12 of the CFP and Year 2 of the expanded 12-team playoff.\n\nAfter two very different CFP semifinal games gave us our final two contenders for the national title, it’s time to put a bow on another stellar year of college football and determine who takes home the national championship for 2025.\n\nWhile our focus will be on who the Oklahoma Sooners are still gaining in the transfer portal once it closes on Friday night, we’ll be able to settle in and watch the season’s final game, before a long offseason awaits in college football.\n\nBelow is a full preview for the national championship game. We’ve also included a recap of the 2025 season in week-by-week form, a list of the college football champions at the lower levels, and a list of the FBS college football all-star games that are scheduled in the lead-up to the 2026 NFL Draft in April.\n\nSo, without further ado, the 156th season of college football comes to an end on Monday night. Here’s your preview for the national championship game.\n\nMiami has defeated Texas A&M, Ohio State and Ole Miss in succession to get to this point, after just sneaking into the CFP on selection day. Head coach Mario Cristobal and the Hurricanes have won in different ways during their playoff run, using a suffocating defense in the first two rounds, before getting a big performance from their offense in the semifinal. The ‘Canes have lost twice this season, but they’ve been rolling ever since, and they believe they have the overall talent to pull off a big upset on their home field.\n\nQuarterback Carson Beck had a huge day in the semis, and he’ll have to keep the mistakes down against an opponent that takes advantage of every miscue you make. This is a team that got here based on physicality up front and winning at the line of scrimmage, but a gigantic final test awaits them on Monday night. The U is oh-so close to being “back”, but to win the school’s first national title since 2001, they’ll have to do something no one else has been able to do this year.\n\nIndiana is the only undefeated FBS team, and they earned a bye in the first round of the playoff. Following that off week, they’ve promptly destroyed both Alabama and Oregon on their way to the title round. Head coach Curt Cignetti has turned the Hoosiers into an absolute juggernaut, and this is a veteran team that doesn’t make mistakes and executes at an extremely high level. Their offense is potent, their defense is everywhere, and they’ve taken down teams with far more overall blue-chippers on the roster with regularity.\n\nQuarterback Fernando Mendoza is the Heisman Trophy winner, and he is unbelievably efficient in this offense. With an excellent o-line, and skill players everywhere, it’s hard to keep up with what the Hoosiers are capable of. Defensively, Indiana forces mistakes constantly, and they make good offenses look bad every week. They set their offense up with short fields and squeeze the life out of their opponents. The Hoosiers are heavily favored on Monday, but if the 2025 season has taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected, and that anything is capable of happening.\n\nNCAA Division I FCS: Montana State Bobcats 35, Illinois State Redbirds 34 (OT)\n\nNCAA Division II: Ferris State Bulldogs 42, Harding Bisons 21\n\nNCAA Division III: Wisconsin River-Falls Falcons 24, North Central Cardinals 14\n\nNAIA: Grand View Vikings 22, Kaiser Seahawks 16\n\nNJCAA Division I: Iowa Western Reivers 28, Hutchinson Blue Dragons 10\n\nNJCAA Division III: DuPage Chaparrals 36, North Dakota State College of Science Wildcats 13\n\nCanadian U Sports college football: Montreal Carabins 30, Saskatchewan Huskies 16\n\nHula Bowl: Team Kai 38, Team Aina 21, in DeLand, Florida on January 10th at 11:00 a.m. CT\n\nTropical Bowl: American Team vs. National Team in Orlando, Florida on January 18th at 10:00 a.m. CT\n\nAmerican Bowl: Warhawks vs. Guardians in Lakeland, Florida on January 22nd at 7:00 p.m. CT\n\nEast-West Shrine Bowl: East Team vs. West Team in Frisco, Texas on January 27th at 6:00 p.m. CT\n\nSenior Bowl: American Team vs. National Team in Mobile, Alabama on January 31st at 1:30 p.m. CT\n\nHBCU Legacy Bowl: Team Robinson vs. Team Gaither in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 21st at 3:00 p.m. CT\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions. You can also follow Aaron on X@Aaron_Gelvin.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sooners Wire: Who will win the college football championship for the 2025 season?",

    "description": "The Miami Hurricanes will face the Indiana Hoosiers in the CFP National Championship. Tickets are available across several websites.",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff reaches a thrilling conclusion on Monday night, and there are a few avenues to explore if you're looking to attend in person. Below, we've outlined everything you need to know about how to get College Football National Championship tickets in 2026, including a comparison of resale ticket prices.\n\nThe 2025 college football season concludes with a January 19, 2026, match-up between the No. 10 Miami Hurricanes and the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers. The two teams will face off at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, home of the Miami Dolphins. Miami beat Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl, and Indiana defeated Oregon in the Peach Bowl, sending the playoff underdog and top seed to the National Championship, where they're both vying for a shot at their first national title in the CFP era.\n\nGetting your hands on tickets to the championship can be tricky, and most tickets are only available through resale sites at the moment. We've compared prices across some of the top resellers, including StubHub and Vivid Seats.\n\nMost College Football Playoff National Championship tickets are sent to the respective schools involved and sold through each institution. On the Miami Hurricanes website, the Miami ticket allotment has sold out. We're also not seeing any tickets available through the Indiana Hoosiers website. This means that the resale ticket market is the next best place to snag a seat if you're still hoping to attend.\n\nThe official fan-to-fan exchange marketplace for the National Championship is through Ticketmaster, but we're also seeing listings on StubHub and Vivid Seats.\n\nThe cheapest resale listings we're seeing right now come from Vivid Seats, where ticket prices start at $2,899. On StubHub, the cheapest resale ticket listings start at $2,965. On Ticketmaster, the cheapest resale tickets start at $3,094. Prices are accurate at the time of writing, but they often fluctuate throughout the day as tickets are purchased and additional listings are added to the sites. The cheapest tickets are for Upper Level seats, while resale listings close to the field are reaching upwards of $15,000 across all sites.\n\nNote: Certain services and regions prohibit the resale of tickets. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal reselling of tickets, and entry into an event is at the venue's discretion.",

    "fullText": "The No. 1 Arizona Wildcats look to remain undefeated as they host the rival Arizona State Sun Devils in Big 12 play tonight.\n\nMy Arizona State vs. Arizona predictions and college basketball picks are bullish on the Wildcats’ offensive outlook for Wednesday, January 14.\n\nArizona State vs Arizona best bet: Arizona team total Over 94.5 (-125)\n\nThe Arizona Wildcats hold huge advantages over the Arizona State Sun Devils in just about every facet of this handicap, and they’re naturally expected to roll at home as 22-point favorites.\n\nRather than jump on that wide spread in a rivalry game, there are other betting opportunities for the No. 1 team in the country.\n\nArizona averages 91.1 points per game and ranks fourth in adjusted offensive efficiency (KenPom). There will be points in bunches available against a porous Arizona State defense surrendering 78.8 ppg and ranking 116th in adjusted defensive efficiency.\n\nBoth teams look to push the pace: the Wildcats rank 26th in adjusted tempo, and the Sun Devils are not far behind at 70th. There will be an abundance of possessions in this high-flying game, and the Wildcats will be able to score efficiently.\n\nArizona guard Jaden Bradley has posted at least five assists in four of his last five games, averaging 5.8 in that span. In an up-tempo game with a high team total, Arizona should do plenty of scoring, and that typically starts with Bradley as the lead guard.\n\nMassambia Diop is a true freshman sensation for the Sun Devils. He’s 7-foot-1 and has tremendous side-to-side agility, so he’ll be on the court for as many minutes as he can handle against a tough opponent with a strong frontcourt.\n\nHe’s picked up his scoring output as he gets more comfortable with the college game, scoring 16+ in each of his last four contests while averaging 19.8 in that span.\n\nMassambia Diop Over 15.5 points\n\nThis wide spread implies Arizona will win in a dominant blowout. While the Wildcats are certainly good enough to make that happen, that’s a narrow outcome to bank on from a betting perspective.\n\nThis is still a rivalry game, after all, and Arizona State has covered the spread in 10 of its last 14 road games.\n\nMassambia Diop Over 15.5 points\n\nSpread: Arizona State +22 | Arizona -22\n\nMoneyline: Arizona State +1600 | Arizona -5000\n\nOver/Under: Over 168 | Under 168\n\nArizona has scored at least 95 points in seven consecutive home games.

    "title": "I'm 7 months postgrad and still job hunting. I'm leaning on my hobbies to help overcome imposter syndrome.",
    "description": "I graduated from college and moved to New York City to apply for full-time jobs. I haven't found one yet, but I've learned to prioritize my hobbies.",
    "fullText": "Before graduating from Syracuse University last spring with a degree in journalism, it seemed like everyone (including me) was scrambling to make plans, get jobs, and figure out where to move.\n\nI always expected life after college would fall seamlessly into place, that all of my involvement in campus media, internships, and good grades would pay off immediately.\n\nSo, when I learned that my childhood friend was planning to move to New York City, it was the perfect opportunity to take the leap together. I'd always dreamed of moving there, and as the home of many big-name publications, it seemed like the right city to be in to kick-start my career.\n\nCome June, I'd moved, gotten a job at a coffee shop, and continued applying to every dream job under the sun (just like the hundreds of other LinkedIn applicants).\n\nLittle did I know, the barista position I'd only planned to have for a month or two would still be my lifeline seven months later.\n\nAt the beginning of my job search, I was incredibly motivated, but slowly, the rejections began to roll in.\n\nI started feeling like maybe I was the problem, that my experiences and skills weren't good enough. How was I supposed to gain more experience if no one would hire me?\n\nImposter syndrome hit me hard, especially since it seemed like the first question anyone wanted to ask me was, \"What do you do?\"\n\nAt first, I'd provide a whole spiel: I just graduated and am working as a barista while I look for a job in journalism, and interviews are going well. I always felt the need to make it appear as though I was on the brink of getting \"the job.\"\n\nThe catalyst for shifting my mindset came later, over dinner with a friend at our favorite Indian restaurant. We talked about life, relationships, New York work culture, and overall, what it means to unplug from the outside world for a second.\n\nMy friend shared his thoughts on being part of corporate America and said he doesn't base his worth on the job he has or his level of success. His words made me think about my own self-worth and why I'd been placing it all on my career and how qualified I am compared to others.\n\nNow, when I'm faced with the \"what do you do\" question, I say I'm a barista and freelancer looking for full-time work in journalism.\n\nI'm less concerned with explaining why I'm not working in corporate yet and more concerned with maintaining my peace and joy, as well as exploring my other interests.\n\nAlthough people's responses to my answers haven't changed much, my confidence in where I'm at and where I'm going has.\n\nAlthough this isn't the life I envisioned having after graduation, I'm grateful for the time I've had to explore my hobbies and be an active member of my community.\n\nAs an avid yogi and certified yoga teacher, I've enjoyed taking free yoga classes in Bryant Park. It's been a great way to get moving, plus it's given me a reason to stop with the endless job applications and catch up with some friends.\n\nIn my free time after barista shifts, I even parlayed my love of yoga into a three-month stint as a front desk receptionist at a studio in SoHo. In exchange for three hours of dedication a week, I got to take unlimited classes from some of the best yoga teachers I've ever had.\n\nAside from yoga, I also signed up with my roommate to volunteer within my Muslim community and teach religious education classes to kids.\n\nGrowing up, I loved attending these classes; it connected me to my culture and was also how my roommate and I met as kids. So, participating in this has felt like a full-circle moment that I likely wouldn't have had if I were already working full-time.\n\nHowever, despite finding a great community, I've found my feelings of imposter syndrome are still present — fueled by the overwhelming chaos and fast-paced energy of the city.\n\nOver the last few months, I've learned NYC isn't the best place for me — at least not right now.\n\nI always come home feeling like I haven't done enough, and it exhausts me. This is partially a result of my mindset, but I also think it's a direct consequence of living in a place known for its hustle.\n\nAlthough living here has been a great experience and played a huge role in helping me gain confidence, I'm ready for somewhere that's slower-paced.\n\nThere are, of course, still days when I struggle with my own self-talk and understanding my purpose, but I'm confident a move is the best next step for me as I continue working toward my goals and exploring all of the other things that make me who I am.\n\nMy time in the industry will come, and until then, I'll keep side-questing and doing everything I can to remain happy and present.",

The Spartans would be slated to face No. 3 seed Denver in the first round of the tournament, according to this bracket projection.\n\nMichigan State ranks as the No. 4 team nationally in this week's USCHO.com poll, and holds an impressive 15-5-0 record on the year. The Spartans, though, haven't been as dominant during the regular season as we've seen in the last two seasons -- which they ended up with No. 1 seeds in each year.\n\nMichigan State is set to play a massive two-game road series at No. 2 Wisconsin this weekend.

    "fullText": "After missing his \"College Gameday\" appearance before the Aggies competed against the Hurricanes in the first round of the CFP, former Heisman-winning quarterback and Texas A&M legend Johnny Manziel explained his side of the story on his Glory Daze podcast.\n\nAccording to Manziel, he missed the scheduled appearance as a guest picker due to a virus that made him sick the night before. He originally planned to attend with music artist Drake and watch Texas A&M take on Miami, but the illness prevented that.\n\nManziel played for the Aggies in 2012 and 2013, becoming the first-ever freshman Heisman winner and just the second player to win the award in program history. Here is the full clip of Manziel discussing the incident that led to his missed appearance.\n\nFormer Texas A&M QB Johnny Manziel explained on his podcast what went into him missing his scheduled “College GameDay” appearance for A&M vs. Miami. He said he planned to go to the game with Drake but got sick the night before with an “unbelievable” virus. https://t.co/jYbSoxsig8 pic.twitter.com/Z7guLzSghd\n\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) January 8, 2026\n\nWhile rumors ran rampant across social media when former Aggie basketball player Alex Caruso was named the guest picker in place of Manziel, he seemed to shut those down on the most recent episode of his podcast. Manziel was in attendance for multiple contests at Kyle Field in 2025, while also spending time with current Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed, who displayed much improvement this season at the helm and will return to play for the Maroon and White for his junior season.\n\nThe year didn't conclude as the Aggies had wished, but head coach Mike Elko has led the program to historic heights in just his second season coaching in Bryan-College Station, Texas. Elko's squad secured the school's first 11-0 start since 1992 and its first playoff appearance in 2025.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Dylan on X: @dylanmflippo.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Former Texas A&M QB Johnny Manziel explains \"College Gameday\" absence",

    "description": "With the 2025 portion of the college women's basketball season over, here's who is shaping up to be one of the teams in the 2026 Final Four.",
    "fullText": "It’s a big year for college women’s basketball in Phoenix, with the Final Four heading to Mortgage Matchup Center on April 3-5, and the potential four teams are taking shape.\n\nWhile there are less than three months before the bracket is set, several leading contenders have emerged. Some schools are blue bloods, while others have steadily become powerhouses.\n\nEach team is led by a cast of stars who will undoubtedly make it an exciting stretch ahead of the Final Four.\n\nThe No. 1 Huskies are a heavy favorite to go undefeated in the regular season, which also makes them a heavy favorite for the Final Four.\n\nThe program’s 15-0 start marks its best opening since the 2017-18 season, when it won its first 36 contests before falling, 91-89 in overtime, to Notre Dame in the national championship game.\n\nSophomore forward Sarah Strong, at the forefront of UConn’s success, has made a compelling case for National Player of the Year. Guard Azzi Fudd has also been playing a big role, furthering the Huskies’ bid for a repeat as champions.\n\nIt’s been another big season for No. 2 Texas as the Longhorns basically drifted through nonconference play.\n\nTexas (17-0) didn’t have an easy schedule, but made quick work of several Top 25 teams, including a 76-65 win over then-No. 3 UCLA. Only South Carolina and Ole Miss have challenged the Longhorns so far, with Texas winning by one possession in both games.\n\nFifth-year point guard Rori Harmon is one of the best in the country and has been the engine for the team. Leading scorer Madison Booker has been having another productive season with at least 20 points in five of her past seven games through Jan. 6.\n\nThe Longhorns have a great shot of getting back to the Final Four for the second consecutive year.\n\nUnder coach Dawn Staley, the Gamecocks are always in consideration for the Final Four.\n\nSince losing in last season’s national title game against UConn, South Carolina has dealt with a great deal of adversity in a short span. The Gamecocks received unfortunate news when forward Chloe Kitts tore her ACL in September, sidelining her for the season.\n\nMore recently, key transfer Ta’Niya Latson injured her ankle in late December and has been day-to-day. The starting guard has averaged 16.9 points this season, and was the scoring leader last season at North Carolina State with 25.2 points per game.\n\nHowever, the Gamecocks have found ways to continue their high-level play. Sophomore forward Joyce Edwards leads the team with 21.0 points. Center Madina Okot has been stellar with 11.5 rebounds per game. South Carolina will soon receive more help in the post with Alicia Tournebize, a 6-foot-7-inch player from France, joining the team midseason and gearing up to play.\n\nOne of the more experienced teams in the NCAA, the Bruins have a great shot of making their second straight Final Four appearance, especially with it potentially being center Lauren Betts’ final season.\n\nBetts, expected to go in the top five of the 2026 WNBA Draft, has surpassed 1,500 career points and has made important defensive plays in the biggest moments for the Bruins.\n\nWhile Betts has been key to UCLA’s success, she’s also been surrounded by depth in senior starters Kiki Rice, Gianna Kneepkens, Charlisse Leger-Walker and Gabriela Jaquez.\n\nUCLA’s starting lineup has combined to play 581 collegiate games, which can play a big factor in winning the Big Ten championship and eventually reaching the Final Four.\n\nThere are a lot of SEC teams that have impressed this season, and the Sooners have shown that they deserve to be considered with the likes of Texas and South Carolina.\n\nThe program has steadily improved under fourth-year head coach Jennie Baranczyk, who took Oklahoma to its first Sweet 16 since 2013 last season. Baranczyk has taken the Sooners to at least the second round of the NCAA Tournament in all four seasons.\n\nOklahoma (14-1) has only gotten better, adding highly touted recruit Aaliyah Chavez to its roster. The guard leads the Sooners and is fourth among freshmen nationally with 18.9 points per game.\n\nThe Sooners rank second in scoring offense at 94.5 points per game, while leading the country in field goal percentage defense (29.8%) and rebounds per game (53.1).\n\nSenior center Raegan Beers has continued to be a force on the boards, ranking 10th nationally with 10.8 rebounds per game. She's also second on the team with 17.4 points.\n\nThe only problem is that Oklahoma will have to play Texas and South Carolina in the regular season, and potentially in the SEC Tournament. One of those teams could hurt the others' chances of gaining a higher seed in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nReach the reporter at jenna.ortiz@arizonarepublic.com, as well as @jennarortiz on X.\n\nCatch the best high school sports coverage in the state.

A win for Ohio State would also make them 4-0 in Big Ten road games for the first time since the 2017-18 team, which won its first five Big Ten road games.\n\nWith Brandon Noel out for the foreseeable future with an unspecified foot injury, Gabe Cupps stepped up for Ohio State against Oregon, scoring nine points on 3-of-4 shooting in 23 minutes. Devin Royal registered his third double-double of the season, scoring 14 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in 36 minutes.\n\nThe Huskies could be without two of their four leading scorers on Sunday night, but their availability won’t be known until closer to game time. Senior guard Desmond Claude is currently away from the team due to a personal matter, and was not at practice on Saturday. Sophomore guard Wesley Yates has missed Washington’s last four games with a wrist injury, and will be a game-time decision on Sunday night. Washington coach Danny Sprinkle has not ruled either player out, but said that if Yates plays, his minutes will be limited.\n\nConnect with Connor: \nTwitter: @lemons_connor",

I think it’s really important to re-emphasize. When you watch a team, and I always come in on Sunday and get ready to watch a team or get ready to play, some things stand out. I don’t watch, necessarily, the — hey, that’s a great touchdown pass.

You never see what happened, like the pick six, where a guy misses a block or something happens. So, perimeter blocking. How about the running back steps up and hits a linebacker or safety coming from a 10-yard running start and the running back hits him right in the jaw,” Meyer said. “And Mendoza completes a pass. The route efficiency. There’s no wasted movement when the receivers run their routes. Those aren’t all five-star receivers; those aren’t first-rounders. Those are guys that are really, really good players that play great.\"\n\nThey will have a chance to showcase themselves once more against a Hurricanes team on a mission to continue shocking college football as they upset Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl before ending Ole Miss' season in the Fiesta Bowl to get to the title game themselves.

A win against the Miami Hurricanes would make the Hoosiers the first major college football program to finish 16-0 since Yale Bulldogs accomplished the feat in 1894 — an era of leather helmets and no forward pass.\n\nWhat makes Indiana’s run even more remarkable is how it was built.

Ponds palmed Dante Moore's first pass attempt just seconds into the game. The Hoosiers cornerback finished the play by sprinting 25 yards up the right flank for an early edge.\n\nDucks quarterback Dante Moore helped even the score with a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jamari Johnson to end the next possession, but the Hoosiers responded with a surge of 35-consecutive points.\n\nMendoza found wide receiver Omar Cooper Jr. for an 8-yard score at the end of the first quarter to give the lead back to the Hoosiers. Moore fumbled early in the second quarter, giving the Hoosiers a short field. Running back Kaelon Black scored on a 1-yard run less than a minute later.\n\nMendoza threw his second score about five minutes later, finding Charlie Becker for a 36-yard touchdown. Moore lost his second fumble -- and committed his third turnover of the half -- on the next Ducks drive. Mendoza threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Elijah Sarratt at the end of the quarter to give the Hoosiers a 28-point lead of the break.\n\nMendoza threw his fourth touchdown pass to a fourth different teammate on the first possession of the second half. That 13-yard pass, which ended an 11-play, 75-yard drive, found E.J. Williams Jr.\n\nDucks running back Jay Harris ran for a 2-yard score on the next drive. But Mendoza continued to pile on, throwing his fifth touchdown pass of the night with 11:36 remaining to push the Hoosiers lead to 49-15.\n\nBlack ran for his second touchdown of the Peach Bowl with 5:13 remaining to further cement the victory.\n\nMoore threw a 1-yard pass to tight end Roger Saleapaga for the final touchdown of the night with 22 seconds remaining. The Ducks quarterback completed 23 of 38 passes for 285 yards, two scores and an interception, in addition to two fumbles. Ducks running back Dierre Hill Jr. logged 111 yards from scrimmage on seven touches.\n\nMendoza completed 17 of 20 passes for 177 yards. Black ran for 63 yards and two scores on 12 carries in the victory. Sarratt led the Hoosiers with 75 yards and two touchdowns on seven catches.\n\nThe Hoosiers and Hurricanes will face off at 7:30 p.m. EST Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium. The game will air on ESPN.\n\n\"It sounds good,\" Hoosiers coach Curt Cignetti said. \"It means we got it done. Now we've got to get ready for one more.\"",

    "fullText": "Indiana left no doubt Friday night, rolling No. 5 Oregon 56–22 in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl to move within one win of a national title.\n\nThe Hoosiers struck immediately when D’Angelo Ponds returned an interception for a touchdown on Oregon’s first offensive snap. Indiana scored touchdowns on five straight possessions, four before halftime, to build a 35–7 lead.\n\nHeisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza threw five touchdown passes, while Oregon quarterback Dante Moore struggled under pressure, committing three first-half turnovers despite passing for 285 yards and two scores. Indiana repeatedly turned short fields into points.\n\nThe 56 points were the most Oregon has allowed in 41 postseason games and the most since Washington scored 70 in 2016. As soon as the final whistle blew on the Hoosiers’ 56–22 College Football Playoff semifinal win, fans turned their attention to the next target: Miami.\n\nWith Hall of Famer Michael Irvin, one of the Hurricanes’ most iconic legends, looming as symbolic motivation, Indiana fans made it clear they believe the belt is coming north.\n\nIrvin has used the phrase “belt to a*s” and the accompanying motion as a declaration of dominance, particularly when speaking about Miami’s swagger and physicality. But after watching Indiana dismantle Oregon on a national stage, Hoosier fans warned Miami that the belt is changing hands.\n\n“Indiana gonna whoop Miami. They gonna take the belt from Michael Irvin,” one fan commented. “The Philly Special,” one said while referring to a video of a Hoosier fan absolutely demolishing a toy duck. “MIAMI IS NEXT,” another warned.\n\nIndiana didn’t just beat Oregon in the Peach Bowl; they humiliated a program that entered the College Football Playoff riding momentum and confidence. By the time the fourth quarter arrived, the outcome was long decided, and the Ducks were simply trying to survive the night.\n\nIndiana (15–0) advances to the College Football Playoff Championship Game, where it will face Miami (13–2) on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nOregon (13–2), meanwhile, heads into the offseason following another lopsided postseason loss. A year after a 41–21 Rose Bowl defeat to Ohio State, the Ducks saw their title hopes end again in emphatic fashion. Both of Oregon’s losses this season came against Indiana, each by double-digit margins, despite the Ducks recording the third 13-win season in program history.\n\nThe post “They Gonna Take the Belt From Michael Irvin”: Indiana Fans Warn Miami After Crushing Oregon in Semis appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Fernando Mendoza and the Hoosiers have once again laid waste to one of the best teams in college football. And only one remains.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA — The air horn at Mercedes-Benz Stadium blasted for the first time Friday night after just 11 seconds. It’s a distinct, piercing sound with a unique local story, ringing through the sky here after every touchdown.\n\nThis city began to sprout up from the ground nearly two centuries ago because it is where the Western & Atlantic railroad made its last stop. With a stake hammered into the ground, they originally called it Terminus — the end of the line.\n\nSince erecting this modern football palace nine years ago and adding the train horn to commemorate how it all began, nearly every great college football team has come through Atlanta on its way to a national title.\n\nBut none have embodied that sound quite like Indiana.\n\nSleek and efficient, powerful and unrelenting, the Indiana Hoosiers — yes, the Indiana Hoosiers — are barreling down the tracks like a locomotive running late for a date with destiny, blowing that horn as a warning to any creature in its path.\n\nHey, after 139 years of mostly bad Indiana football, what’s another 10 days to become the most mesmerizing national champion we’ve ever seen?\n\nPerhaps the Jan. 19 national championship game against Miami will become something other than a Hoosier coronation. But after Indiana’s tour de force through the College Football Playoff, including a savage 56-22 beatdown of Oregon here in the Peach Bowl, rarely have we encountered a college football team that looks and feels more inevitable than this one.\n\n“They’re complete,” Oregon coach Dan Lanning said. “They do a lot, and they do it really, really well. There’s not a weakness in their game. They run the ball well, they stop the run well, they throw the ball well, they defend the pass well, they've been good on special teams. They obviously have a ton of belief, and deservedly so. They’re really good.”\n\nOregon, it turned out, never really had a chance.\n\nWhen these two teams played in mid-October, with Indiana winning 30-20 on the road in Autzen Stadium, the game was competitive enough to make a dramatic rematch seem plausible.\n\nBut it took 11 seconds to realize Indiana football has subsequently evolved into something different. It is now a weapon sharpened for dissection, a machine built for humiliation, deployed with confidence and precision as its coach stalks the sideline with an eternal expression of annoyance.\n\nOn the first play from scrimmage, Indiana cornerback D’Angelo Ponds — one of the many players who followed coach Curt Cignetti from James Madison to Indiana two years ago — read the eyes of Oregon quarterback Dante Moore, jumped the route and snagged a pick-6 to trip that air horn for the first time.\n\nThen Indiana did it four more times before the first half concluded, each one chipping away at Oregon’s belief until it became a myth. By the time both teams went to the locker room with the Hoosiers leading 35-7, the only point of comparison for a CFP semifinal in this building was LSU’s 63-28 win over Oklahoma six years ago.\n\nSince that season, 2019 LSU has remained the gold standard for modern-era college football dominance, a team so ruthless in the way it attacked opponents that most realized after awhile they never had a chance in the first place.\n\nIndiana is one more performance like this from taking their crown.\n\n“A lot of people [who doubted us] really don't know our team,” Cignetti said. “They don't know what we're made of, what we got, and I get it. There was a lot of skepticism after last year that we were a fluke. That team did a lot of great things and got it all started. We’ve just built off our successes, and we've won some big games on the road, and it helps when you have a quarterback play his best football when the game's online in the fourth quarter. And so, you know, here we are.”\n\nPlayer for player, the Hurricanes will believe they’re the better team based on recruiting rankings, physical size and NFL Draft stock. But so did Oregon and Alabama, which lost to the Hoosiers by a combined 69 points in this playoff.\n\nWith Indiana, it’s not about the measurables. All season long, the Hoosiers have been a nuclear missile of execution and attitude, mocking anyone who dared not believe a program with a litany of laments and losing seasons could turn into this juggernaut practically overnight.\n\nIt was the seventh time against an FBS opponent this year Indiana has won by 30 or more points, and at every turn, they’ve thirsted for more. Beating Ohio State to become Big Ten champs for the first time since 1967? Not enough. A Rose Bowl romp over Alabama? They expected it long before we realized it was possible.\n\nEven when this game against Oregon was well in hand in the fourth quarter, Indiana kept delivering indignities. Only after one final 24-yard touchdown run by Kaelon Black, which drew the slightest smile from Cignetti’s lips with 5:14 to go, had Indiana’s appetite been satisfied. For a little while, anyway.\n\n“Our philosophy is to attack,” Cignetti said. “The reason we are where we are is because we prepared the right way, and that's why we've been able to meet the challenge and put it on the field.”\n\nAnd when the game finally ended, it looked like the most perfunctory of Indiana’s three big celebrations this postseason. This wasn’t like the relief of conquering the Big Ten or the sheer joy of reducing college football’s most iconic brand to a bystander in Pasadena. This was the moment before the moment, the one that seems poised to stamp Indiana as the greatest turnaround story maybe in the history of American sports.\n\n“I don’t think there’s any time to celebrate because this is what everybody dreams of,” Mendoza said.\n\nNow just one game remains as the Indiana train rolls through Atlanta, headed to Miami at maximum speed. To Terminus and beyond.",

    "description": "For the second year in a row, Oregon was blown out in the College Football Playoff when it fell to Indiana. Where do the Ducks go from here.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA — Oregon will chew on this one for 239 days, reliving a 56-22 blowout loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl again and again until its 2026 season kicks off against Boise State on Sept 5.\n\nIf only these new Hoosiers were still the same-old Hoosiers. If only. The Indiana program’s evolution into a Power Four devourer of worlds was the one hurdle in the Ducks’ path during a season that can split into two camps: on one side, two losses in two games against Hoosiers; on the other, 13 wins in as many tries against everyone else.\n\nOregon bulldozed No. 12 seed James Madison in the opening round of the College Football Playoff and then did the same to No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl. But Indiana presented a challenge Oregon couldn’t overcome. That no one else has conquered the Hoosiers doesn’t make this one any easier to swallow.\n\nPATH TO PLAYOFF: \n“I think it's probably too premature for me to speak on what happened tonight until I go back and really evaluate it,” said Oregon coach Dan Lanning. “I also think you can't discredit that we played well. We've played well at times even here in the postseason. Yeah, there will be an opportunity for reflection and evaluation, but I couldn't speak on that right now.”\n\nOn the heels of a second one-sided playoff loss to a Big Ten foe in as many years — the 2024 Ducks went unbeaten in the regular season and won the conference but suffered a 41-24 loss to Ohio State in the Rose Bowl that was over in the first half — Oregon can only wonder:\n\nHow did this happen? And what do we have to change to finally capture an elusive national title?\n\n“Man, you hurt for those guys because the world is going to judge everybody in that room based on the result tonight,” said Lanning. “They're not failures. These guys won a lot of damn ball games. They've had a lot of success. They've changed some peoples' lives, but right now, that moment is going to hurt.”\n\nThe first question is easy to answer. Indiana is unquestionably the better team, defying recruiting rankings that heavily favor Oregon. In every way and on nearly every play, the Hoosiers dictated the terms to the Ducks, just as they did earlier this month in a similar rout of No. 9 seed Alabama in the Rose Bowl.\n\nBut in addition to being more physical and more explosive on both sides of the ball, Indiana was unmoved by the high-pressure stakes that have come with each new achievement this team has unlocked during a breathtaking 2025 season.\n\nThe same can’t be said of Oregon. To suffer another meltdown on this stage raises significant concerns about the Ducks’ preparedness and mindset in neutral-site games against the best of the best.\n\n“Man, I feel like the gameplan we had was awesome,” said Oregon guard Dave Iuli. “I just feel like, you know, we went out there and didn’t execute our jobs. Usually, when it comes to critical moments like this with three teams left or four teams left, the biggest thing is executing. Once people stopped executing, we stopped winning.”\n\nQuarterback Dante Moore tossed a pick-six on the first play from scrimmage. He fumbled with 9:29 left in the second quarter to goose an Indiana touchdown drive that put the Hoosiers up 21-7. He fumbled again about seven minutes later to set up another touchdown, making it 35-7 at the half.\n\nWith lead running backs Noah Whittington and Jordon Davison unable to play due to injury, backups Dierre Hill Jr. and Jay Harris combined for 121 yards on 21 carries. But the Ducks ran for 93 yards on 3.6 yards per carry as a team, counting sacks, with 71 yards coming on a Hill run in the third quarter when they were down 35 points.\n\nOffensively, Oregon was wobbled early and remained off-balance the rest of the way, unable to regain its footing as Indiana pinned its ears back and threw the kitchen sink at Moore.\n\n“They have a great defense, great disguise and different looks, but you can't win football games if you're causing turnovers,” Moore said. “But overall, I mean, Indiana’s defense is great, defensive coordinator, but at the end of the day, we beat ourselves.”\n\nDefensively, a group that engulfed the Duke and the Red Raiders was helpless against Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza and a brilliant, steady-handed receiver corps headed by Elijah Sarrat (75 yards and two touchdowns), Omar Cooper Jr. (one score) and Charlie Becker (48 yards and two scores).\n\nWhile the Hoosiers had three sacks and 10 tackles for loss, Oregon’s defensive front barely sniffed Mendoza, who continued his Joe Burrow-like postseason run by hitting on 17 of 20 passes for 177 yards and five touchdowns. Through two playoff games, he has more touchdowns, eight, than incompletions, five.\n\nAnd while the Ducks committed three game-changing giveaways in the first half, Indiana continued to play nearly perfect football. The Hoosiers turned the ball over with a fumble on their 18th play from scrimmage in the season opener against Old Dominion but have not lost a fumble since.\n\nAdding insult to injury, an Oregon punt near its own goal line in the fourth quarter was blocked by Indiaan, which then scored on a short Mendoza pass to Sarratt for a third touchdown drive lasting fewer than 22 yards.\n\n“Yeah, it sucks right now,” said linebacker Bryce Boettcher. “I'm not going to lie. Not how I envisioned it whatsoever. Obviously prepared to win, and Indiana was a better team tonight. Doesn't take away from our season. We had one heck of a season.”\n\nIt's possible to look at this loss with a slightly optimistic slant: Oregon was minus-three in turnover margin and doomed its own chances against the No. 1-ranked team in the country. The loss hurts, sure, but the Ducks have still gone 26-3 since joining the Big Ten last season. There is no question this is an elite program.\n\nYet regular-season success is just not translating to the postseason. As the Ducks head into a crucial offseason defined by their ability to rebuild a roster set to be picked apart by graduation and early NFL draft entries, Lanning’s biggest charge will be assessing and fixing the flaws that have led to two humbling playoff losses in as many years.\n\nOne common thread has been a flat and sluggish start. The Buckeyes buried the Ducks by taking a 34-0 lead in the second quarter of last January’s Rose Bowl. Indiana led by 28 at the break. While the Ducks flopped out of the gate and never recovered, the Hoosiers resembled an unstoppable, merciless, Terminator-like machine that craves to not just beat their opponent but bury them.\n\nTo say the Ducks were simply outmanned by one eventual champion in Ohio State and a potentially historic squad in Indiana is way too tidy an explanation. That excuse works for the have-nots in the Big Ten and elsewhere, teams that expect to be body-slammed by the best of the best in the Power Four.\n\nThat’s not Oregon. The Ducks have higher aspirations; in fact, the program rightfully believes it can beat anyone, anywhere, under any conditions, after spending most of this century knocking on the door of the national title.\n\nBut it was one thing to reach the title game against Auburn in the Bowl Championship Series era and against Ohio State in the first year of the four-team playoff format. Winning the 12-team reboot requires much more: Teams need to be almost perfectly constructed and mentally unflappable to thrive against this gauntlet.\n\nAgain, that’s not Oregon, which is built to reach this point but not to advance. For a program that believes a title is part of its destiny, this loss should trigger a long offseason of soul-searching, with plenty of questions but no obvious answers.\n\n“I think every man can learn from adversity. I just told that whole locker room, right, this is going to be about how you respond in life,” said Lanning.\n\n“This is going to be a life lesson that a lot of people never get. We just got our butt kicked. Right? That's going to happen in life, right, and not just Dante. Every single person in the locker room, every coach, every person can learn, ‘Hey, how do you respond to that?’”\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Oregon after CFP blowout loss in Peach Bowl faces soul-searching",

    "fullText": "A transfer portal spiraling out of control prompted the new regulatory body for college sports to issue a memo to athletic directors Friday night saying it has “serious concerns” about some of the multimillion-dollar contracts being offered to players.\n\nThe “reminder” from the College Sports Commission came out about an hour before kickoff of the semifinal between Indiana and Oregon in a College Football Playoff that has shared headlines with news of players signing seven-figure deals to move or, in some cases, stay where they are.\n\nThe CSC reminded the ADs that, according to the rules, third-party deals to use players' name, image and likeness “are evaluated at the time of entry in NIL Go, not before, and each deal is evaluated on its own merits.”\n\n\"Without prejudging any particular deal, the CSC has serious concerns about some of the deal terms being contemplated and the consequences of those deals for the parties involved,\" the memo said.\n\nUnder terms of the House settlement that dictated the rules for NIL payments, schools can share revenue with their players directly from a pool of $20.5 million. Third-party deals, often arranged by businesses created to back the schools, are being used as workarounds this so-called salary cap.\n\nThe CSC, through its NIL Go portal, is supposed to evaluate those deals to make sure they are for a valid business purpose and fall within a fair range of compensation for the services being provided.\n\nThe CSC did not list examples of unapproved contracts, but college football has seen its share of seven-figure deals luring players to new schools since the transfer portal opened on Jan. 2.\n\nOne high-profile case involved Washington quarterback Demond Williams Jr., who initially sought to enter the transfer portal and turn his back on a reported deal worth $4 million with the Huskies. Legal threats ensued and Williams changed course and stayed at Washington.\n\n\"Making promises of third-party NIL money now and figuring out how to honor those promises later leaves student-athletes vulnerable to deals not being cleared, promises not being able to be kept, and eligibility being placed at risk,\" the CSC letter said.\n\nThe commission listed two rules about contracts it evaluates, some of which have been termed “agency agreement” or “services agreement” in what look like attempts to bypass the rules.\n\n—\"The label on the contract does not change the analysis; if an entity is agreeing to pay a student-athlete for their NIL, the agreement must be reported to NIL Go within the reporting deadline.\"\n\n—\"An NIL agreement or payment with an associated entity or individual ... must include direct activation of the student-athlete’s NIL rights.\" This is a reference to the practice of “warehousing” NIL rights by paying first, then deciding how to use them later.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Indiana vs. Oregon\n\nCollege Football Playoff schedule 2026\n\nWhen the No. 7 Indiana Hoosiers defeated the No. 3 Oregon Ducks in Autzen Stadium on October 11, Curt Cignetti and the Hoosiers finally announced their status as the new college football powerhouse. This 30-20 performance in one of the sport's most hostile environments was the season’s inflection point, cementing Indiana’s spectacular rise from historical underdog to national title contender.\n\nNow, less than three months later, the undefeated Hoosiers and the 13-1 Ducks meet again in the 2026 College Football Playoff semifinals. This is a clash of two established heavyweights, the last two Big Ten champions, led by two of the sport’s most successful and dynamic program builders, meeting with everything on the line.\n\nCignetti is the ultimate program architect, having accomplished a turnaround many call the greatest in college football history. Taking over the losingest program in the sport, Cignetti immediately installed a championship culture, leading the Hoosiers to a remarkable 25-2 record in two years in Bloomington. That run peaked just days ago with a 38-3 thrashing of perennial powerhouse Alabama in the Rose Bowl. Now in his second season, Cignetti has led Indiana to an undefeated campaign, the program's first-ever No. 1 ranking, and their first outright Big Ten championship since 1945.\n\nAcross the field is Dan Lanning, the defensive mastermind who has rapidly transformed Oregon into a consistent powerhouse, never missing a beat in a new conference landscape. Since taking over in Eugene, Lanning is a staggering 48-7, a tenure that includes leading Oregon to an undefeated season and Big Ten championship in their first year in the conference. While the Ducks experienced playoff heartbreak last season, they have since rattled off two dominating wins in the 2025 postseason to set up a rematch with the only team that has beat them this season.\n\nThe electric tension of this high-stakes rematch is amplified by the star power under center — two phenomenal quarterbacks whose seasons have carried their teams to the precipice of a national championship appearance. Fernando Mendoza became the first Indiana player ever to win the Heisman Trophy, leading the nation in total touchdowns. For Oregon, the offense flows through the arm of Dante Moore, who has orchestrated one of the most explosive and balanced attacks in the nation, thriving in Lanning’s system with pinpoint accuracy and commanding control.\n\nThe No. 1 Hoosiers and No. 5 Ducks have been, without question, two of the best teams in college football in 2025: both rank top-10 in scoring offense and scoring defense, boast explosive stars on both sides of the ball, and are guided by two of the sharpest coaches in the game. That's why they own a combined record of 27-1 and now face off for a national championship berth, with one team a win away from bringing home its first title in school history.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scoring updates and highlights for Indiana vs. Oregon in the College Football Playoff semifinals.

They are the top two quarterbacks in the country and are expected to be the top two quarterbacks in the draft.

    "title": "My parents are paying for my younger sister's college, but I had to take out loans. It's unfair and makes me angry.",
    "description": "\"For Love & Money\" answers your relationship and money questions. This week, a reader is angry about her parents' adapted parenting style.",
    "fullText": "I am the oldest daughter of three siblings. I'm three years older than my brother and 12 years older than my sister. We have a great, tight-knit family, and my parents have always showered us with love.\n\nHowever, my issue is that my parents have changed their parenting style, and my younger sister is having a very different experience from the one I had, even though my dad still works the same job as he did 12 years ago, and my mom still stays home.\n\nI had to work and take out loans to attend college and cover my lifestyle needs after graduating from high school. However, I found out over the holidays that my sister, who graduates this spring, will attend college entirely on my parents' dime. She has never had to work a job because they worry it will distract her from her grades.\n\nI barely concealed my anger when I found out, but the more I think about it, the angrier I get. I don't want to start anything with my parents, and I do like where I am in life, but my late teens and early 20s were really difficult for me, and I am still repaying student loans. I know if I don't confront them about this now, I'm likely to blow up on them about it eventually. How do I talk to them about this?\n\nOn a crisp April day in 2004, my mom picked me up from my homeschool co-op with a surprise in the back seat: a tiny baby girl, 15 years my junior. In the early days, I helped my mom care for my little sister, but within a few years, I transitioned to being more like a frequent houseguest after leaving for college. I wanted to bond with my sister during my visits home, but I often found myself distracted by my parents' brand-new parenting style, in which screen limits ceased to exist and the \"Oh come on, you aren't sick!\" of my childhood was replaced with \"I don't think she feels good\" every time my sister misbehaved.\n\nComedian Nate Bergatze has a great bit on this phenomenon, describing his much younger sister apparently being \"raised by her best friends\" rather than by the tightly structured, rule-heavy parents who defined his own upbringing.\n\nAs I was writing this column, I texted my mother to ask her about the disparity. She explained, \"As a young parent, you think your kids aren't bothered or harmed by various external hardships. But as you get older, you see the impact, and so you become more protective of your younger child's emotional health, and that might look like too much grace.\"\n\nMy mom's explanation seems to tally with your experience. Your struggles in your late teens and early 20s are likely the very reason your parents have tried to ease your sister's entrée to adulthood. This may translate into something that looks like favoritism, but it actually reflects the time and energy they've spent reviewing your upbringing and what they wish they'd done differently for you.\n\nThere's also a good chance your parents' financial situation has improved in the last 12 years, saving steadily despite having the same jobs they've always had. Parenting philosophies tend to align with a family's financial means. For instance, if I have money to spend on the new Nike sneakers that all the cool kids at school are wearing, I'll build a whole case in my mind around my kid's self-esteem to justify buying them. However, if I don't have the money to do so, I suddenly have no interest in raising materialistic conformists. Perhaps your parents valued self-sufficiency when you were coming of age, due to their financial constraints at the time, but now value stability and provision, given they can afford it.\n\nUnderstanding an explanation, however, doesn't mean the changes your parents have made for your sister don't hurt you, or that you need to spare your parents' feelings about their impact on you. As you alluded to, talking about these things is the best way to keep ourselves from falling out over them.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean you need to have a huge, emotional conversation about it, however. Instead, the dialogue should take the form that best suits your goals. If you want your parents' financial support to pay off your remaining college debt, I suggest approaching the conversation seriously. Schedule the discussion in advance, and during the meeting, focus on your financial need and only mention your sister's situation as the reason you felt you could ask. Don't accuse your parents of favoritism or dwell on your hurt feelings.\n\nYou could say something like, \"You mentioned paying for my sister's tuition the other day, and I'm so glad you're able to do that. I remember how stressful it was for me to work and take out loans during college. I understand that our family's financial situation was different back then, and I don't blame you for it. However, now that you're in a more stable position, I was wondering if you could help cover some of my education costs as well, since I still have a lot of college debt.\" This way, the comparison speaks for itself without putting your parents on the defensive.\n\nHowever, if you've accepted the way things are, but would like to address the hurt you feel, I wouldn't schedule a whole conversation for it. I would simply start talking about it as it comes up — even joking about it, Nate Bargatze-style. For instance, when I texted my mom to get a quote about parenting her youngest very differently than her older children, I didn't offer a qualifier or soften my reasoning for why she might be an expert on the topic. She knows I feel this way because when my sister dyed her hair blue at 15, I reminded everyone that when I came home from college at 19 with a cartilage piercing, Mom made me take it out.\n\nYour family will likely recognize the real sense of injustice behind your jokes and comments. Sure, it may annoy them, and it will absolutely annoy your sister, but there's nothing wrong with gently telling your truth. Your parents have changed their parenting style without apology; this is your honest response.\n\nI only gave my mom 10 minutes to respond with a quote because I was on a deadline, after all. She didn't argue the past; she explained it. Because we all know how it was. We make allowances for one another's humanity — my entitled demands for quotes, her evolving her parenting style, which I couldn't reap the benefits of. To me, that's the real proof of loving families like mine and yours; we can handle the truth because we know what we share is bigger than all of it. We keep these loving relationships strong by not holding resentment or anger inside, but instead addressing those feelings as honestly and constructively as we can.\n\nLooking for advice on how your savings, debt, or another financial challenge is affecting your relationships?

The college student was found dead at the bottom of an apartment complex. The Austin Police Department suggested that Aguilera took her own life, though the cheerleader's mother strongly disagreed.\n\nStephanie Rodriguez, the mother of the deceased cheerleader, ripped Austin Police for their investigation.\n\n“Please don’t believe this lazy investigator and Investigation!” Stephanie Rodriguezwrote on Facebook.\n\nNow, the parents of the cheerleader have filed a $1 million lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against Austin Blacks Rugby Club and the University of Texas’ Latin Economics and Business Association. The seven-figure lawsuit accuses the two school organizations of allegedly serving their daughter alcohol before her death.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Aguilera was served her first drink around 6 p.m. She was allegedly continued to be served drinks for several hours, before stumbling away. Aguilera ended up at an apartment where she was supposed to spend the night. Ultimately, she fell to her death around midnight.\n\n“We believe even more today this was not a suicide as has been suggested by police. This was either an accident or something much more sinister,” Tony Buzbee, lead attorney with the Buzbee Law Firm, who is representing Aguilera’s parents, said at a press conference.\n\nHe added: “If the police department will not do its job, then we will do it for them.\"\n\nThe police said that they found a deleted suicide note on Aguilera's phone. However, attorneys representing Aguilera's family say that it was just a drafted essay.\n\nAn official cause of death has yet to be released. An investigation into the death remains to be underway.",

Rebels running back Kewan Lacy then gutted the Hurricanes defense with a career-long 73-yard touchdown run 10 seconds into the second quarter.\n\nBut Lacy, who picked up a hamstring injury, didn't see another carry in the first half. Hurricanes running back CharMar Brown scored on a 4-yard run to end the next drive.\n\nRebels kicker Lucas Carneiro tied the score with a 42-yard field goal on the next possession, but the Hurricanes answered with their second score of the night. That score -- a 52-yard pass from Beck to wide receiver Keelan Marion -- and an extra point gave a 17-10 lead for the Hurricanes.\n\nCarneiro made a 58-yard kick just before halftime to cut the deficit to four points at the break.\n\nDavis and Carneiro each missed 51-yard kicks on the first two drives of the second half. Rebels safety Kapena Gushiken snatched a deflected pass for an interception of Beck on the next possession.\n\nCarneiro hit the left upright and bounced in another three points for the Rebels about three minutes later, trimming the deficit to 17-16.\n\nThe Rebels unearthed their pass rush at the start of the fourth quarter, picking up two sacks on the Hurricanes' first drive of the frame. They then put together their longest drive of the night, using 14 plays to get another Carneiro field goal and take back the lead with about seven minutes remaining.\n\nFreshman phenom Malachi Toney took momentum back when he caught a short pass from Beck on the next drive and revved for a 36-yard touchdown, helping the Hurricanes take a 24-19 advantage.\n\nBut Chambliss used his legs and live arm to wrestle back the advantage less than two minutes later. The Rebels quarterback threw a 24-yard dart to tight end Dae'Quan Wright for that score. He followed with a successful two-point conversion throw to wide receiver Caleb Odom for a 27-24 edge with 3:13 remaining.\n\nBeck responded by using 14 plays to get the Hurricanes to the Rebels 3-yard line. He took the next snap, scanned through progressions to his right and darted to a clear patch of grass on his left before finding the end zone with his clutch gallop.\n\nChambliss used the game's final seconds to march the Rebels deep into Hurricanes territory, but his final pass dropped incomplete as time expired.\n\nThe Rebels quarterback completed 23 of 37 passes for 277 yards and a score in the loss. Beck completed 23 of 37 passes for the Hurricanes, including seven completions to Marion, who totaled a game-high 114 yards.\n\nToney amassed 81 yards on five catches, including his touchdown. Hurricanes running back Mark Fletcher Jr. ran for 133 yards on 22 carries. Lacy totaled 103 yards and a score on 11 carries, with the majority of his production coming from his career-long sprint.\n\nOregon (13-1) will meet Indiana (14-0) in the second College Football Playoff semifinal at 7:30 p.m. EST Friday in Atlanta. The winner will face the Hurricanes in the national title game Jan. 19 in Miami Gardens, Fla.",

    "fullText": "Betting on himself pays off in a heartbeat. And Carson Beck’s decision to stay in college football for one more season turns golden as Miami heads to the CFP finals with a 31–27 win over Ole Miss. This is their first championship berth since 2001, and all thanks to Beck’s last-minute game-changing TDs that turned things around. Now, Beck sums up the moment like a hero.\n\n“We never flinched,” Miami quarterback Carson Beck said after the game. “We, I mean, in the face of adversity, when we had to respond, we responded. You could just see it in their eye. You could see it in their eye. We all had a good feeling that what just happened was about to happen.\n\n“I actually went in drive, and you were trying to loosen them up by some right before you drove it down for the win. I told them, we got three minutes for the rest of our lives, bro. No shit else matters, alright? I don’t mean to cuss. Emotions are rolling, but nothing else matters. We got three minutes to go do this, man.”\n\nCarson Beck scrambled for a three-yard rushing touchdown with 18 seconds left, sending Miami past Ole Miss. Something that he later calls “the best feeling I ever had in my life.” The game swung wildly in the fourth quarter as Ole Miss brightly took control of the game.\n\nQuarterback Trinidad Chambliss connected with Wright on a 24-yard touchdown pass to put the Rebels ahead 27-24 with 3:13 minutes remaining. Despite that, Beck steadies the Hurricanes, calmly leading the game-changing drive.\n\nThe post Carson Beck Reveals Last 3 Minute Moment Before Historic Miami Touchdown appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

And despite Kiffin no longer coaching the Rebels, he is able to continue financially benefiting from his old team's playoff victories.\n\nLanguage in Kiffin's LSU contract allows him to still receive the bonuses for playoff success he would have received from Ole Miss had he stayed at the school.\n\nHere's what to know about how much Lane Kiffin makes from Ole Miss' CFP wins.\n\nMORE: Which Ole Miss assistants followed Lane Kiffin to LSU?\n\nThe Advocate reported that Kiffin agreed to a seven-year deal, $91 million deal in Baton Rouge, which also has opportunities to earn more via incentives. Additionally, language in Kiffin's contract reportedly requires a raise from LSU to make him the highest-paid coach in the country if he wins a national championship.\n\nIn the deal, LSU committed to paying any bonuses Kiffin would have received during Ole Miss' playoff run, per ESPN.\n\nKiffin is reportedly set to make $13 million annually, making him one of the highest-paid coaches in college football. Georgia's Kirby Smart is the only coach who makes more annually, based on reported figures.\n\nKiffin's Ole Miss salary in 2025 was exactly $9 million, per USA Today, which made him the 11th highest-paid head coach in college football. Kiffin signed a six-year extension worth $54 million in 2023 with Ole Miss.\n\nMORE: The highest paid coaches in college football\n\nLSU included language in Kiffin's new contract that allows him to financially benefit from when his former team, Ole Miss, wins playoff games. When Ole Miss beat Tulane in the first round of the CFP, Kiffin received $250,000, per Front Office Sports.

    "fullText": "Miami Madness: How Hurricanes won CFP semifinal thriller against Ole Miss originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIs the College Football Playoff now the College Football Tournament?\n\nThat's how this feels now. The CFP is the CFT – and that is how the ACC is back in the championship game. \"January Madness\" doesn't have the same ring to it.\n\nWhat about \"Miami Madness\"? It's here.\n\nHow else can you explain how the Hurricanes will play for the College Football Playoff championship on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.? No. 10 Miami created that with a thrilling 31-27 victory against No. 6 Ole Miss in the College Football Playoff semifinal at Vrbo Fiesta Bowl on Thursday.\n\nQuarterback Carson Beck – a sixth-year senior transfer from Georgia – high-stepped into the end zone with a 3-yard touchdown run with 18 seconds remaining. That was the score in a back-and-forth with Ole Miss star quarterback Trinidad Chambliss in a 25-point fourth quarter that resembled the final minutes of a March Madness thriller.\n\nIt wasn't over until Chambliss' desperation pass into the end zone between Ethan O'Connor and Zechariah Poyser fell incomplete. There was no late flag this time.\n\nMiami (13-2) beat Ole Miss (13-2), and now faces the winner of the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl between No. 1 Indiana (14-0) and No. 5 Oregon (13-1).\n\nIs this how the 12-team College Football Playoff is going to work? Do you love it?\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nOle Miss kicker Lucas Carneiro took center stage in CFP\n\nWhat is next for Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss?\n\nThe Hurricanes had +2700 odds to win the national championship coming into the CFP as the “bubble team.” Miami was on the outside looking in through most of November, but they leap-frogged No. 11 Notre Dame in the final set of rankings as the last at-large team in the field.\n\nThe Hurricanes watched five-loss Duke win the ACC championship game against Virginia, but the Hurricanes were the team the conference campaigned for to get into the field. By no coincidence, ACC commissioner Jim Phillips could be seen on the sideline Thursday wearing an orange-and-white tie. This is a huge win for the conference made better by knocking the SEC out of the field.\n\nMORE: SEC lags behind in bowl standings\n\nThe Hurricanes have pulled off upsets against Texas A&M and Ohio State, then won the thriller against Ole Miss to keep the momentum going. They will be underdogs again against the Hoosiers or Ducks. So it could be argued that Miami – the program with five national championships – is your realistic College Football Playoff version of a Cinderella.\n\nMiami led 17-13 at halftime – but it felt like the Hurricanes should have led by more. The Hurricanes out-gained the Rebels 228-145, ran 19 more offensive plays and controlled time of possession at 22 minutes and 14 seconds compared to Ole Miss at seven minutes and 16 seconds.\n\nThe Hurricanes made those little plays that made a difference. Miami faced a third-and-8 in the second quarter. Beck fired a short pass to receiver Malachi Toney, who stepped out of the tackle by Suntarine Perkins and picked up the first down.\n\nThe Hurricanes turned that into a 4-yard TD run by CharMar Brown with 7:23 left in the half. Beck hit a wide-open Keelan Marion for a 52-yard TD on the next drive. Ole Miss countered that with a pair of field goals from Lucas Carneiro from 42 and 58 yards, respectively, for the 17-13 halftime score.\n\nThe Hurricanes tried to give it back in the second half. Miami defensive players dropped four interceptions in the game and had a series of head-scratching penalties. Ole Miss had a 24-19 lead before Toney took a screen pass from Beck for a 36-yard TD with 5:04 remaining for a  24-19 lead.\n\nOle Miss got the ball back with 5:04 remaining, and Chambliss continued his heater that led the Rebels to a 39-34 victory in the Allstate Sugar Bowl. Chambliss threw a 24-yard TD pass to Dae'Quan Wright with 3:13 remaining for a 27-24 lead. Miami answered with a 15-play, 75-yard drive led by Beck, who finished 23 of 37 for 268 yards, two TDs and one interception.\n\nChambliss – who finished 23 of 37 for 277 yards and a TD – nearly led the Rebels to the CFP championship game. This was the team whose coach Lane Kiffin took the LSU job at the end of the regular season. Yet an instant classic that had four lead changes ended with Miami going home for the national championship.\n\nThis would only add to the \"Madness.\" Consider that since 2014, only one men's basketball team that held the No. 1 overall seed going into the NCAA Tournament has won the national championship. That was No. 1 UConn, which won back-to-back national titles. The previous season, the Huskies beat No. 5 Miami in the Final Four.\n\nWere those Hurricanes under Jim Larranaga any more of a long-shot than the ones on the football field that have burned through No. 7 Texas A&M and No. 2 Ohio State – the defending national champion – before beating the Rebels on Thursday?\n\nMiami's defense has injuries. A defense that had 12 sacks in the first two rounds with Rueben Bain Jr. had just one sack against the Rebels. Yet Miami coach Mario Cristobal has found a way to push this team into the championship game with a patient running game – Miami had 51 rushing attempts while Ole Miss had 21 with Mark Fletcher Jr. totaling 22 carries for 133 yards – and Beck is now 37-5 as a starter.\n\nThey'll be in their backyard too, the unintended home-field advantage that will come with a list of Miami icons watching from the sidelines. Did anybody think this was possible when the Hurricanes played their final home game in the regular season against NC State on Nov. 15 before five straight wins away from home?\n\nThere is only one word for that.",

    "fullText": "Sample of roughly 500 posts shows how frequently people are creating sexualized images with Elon Musk’s AI chatbot\n\nNew research that samples X users prompting Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok demonstrates how frequently people are creating sexualized images with it. Nearly three-quarters of posts collected and analyzed by a PhD researcher at Dublin’s Trinity College were requests for nonconsensual images of real women or minors with items of clothing removed or added.\n\nThe posts offer a new level of detail on how the images are generated and shared on X, with users coaching one another on prompts; suggesting iterations on Grok’s presentations of women in lingerie or swimsuits, or with areas of their body covered in semen; and asking Grok to remove outer clothing in replies to posts containing self-portraits by female users.\n\nAmong hundreds of posts identified by Nana Nwachukwu as direct, nonconsensual requests for Grok to remove or replace clothing, dozens reviewed by the Guardian show users posting pictures of women including celebrities, models, stock photos and women who are not public figures posing in snapshots.\n\nSeveral posts in the trove reviewed by the Guardian have received tens of thousands of impressions and come from premium, “blue check” accounts, including accounts with tens of thousands of followers. Premium accounts with more than 500 followers and 5m impressions over three months are eligible for revenue-sharing under X’s eligibility rules.\n\nIn one Christmas Day post, an account with more than 93,000 followers presented side-by-side images of an unknown woman’s backside with the caption: “Told Grok to make her butt even bigger and switch leopard print to USA print. 2nd pic I just told it to add cum on her ass lmao.”\n\nA 3 January post, representative of dozens reviewed by the Guardian, captioned an apparent holiday snap of an unknown woman: “@grok replace give her a dental floss bikini.” Within two minutes, Grok provided a photorealistic image that satisfied the request. Other posts in the trove show more sophisticated employment of JSON-prompt engineering to induce Grok to generate novel sexualized images of fictitious women.\n\nThe data does not cover all such requests made to Grok. While content analysis firm Copyleaks reported on 31 December that X users were generating “roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute”, Nwachukwu said that her sample is limited to just more than 500 posts she was able to collect with X’s API via a developer account. She said that the true scale “could be thousands, it could be hundreds of thousands” but that changes made by Musk to the API mean that “it is much harder to see what is happening” on the platform. On Wednesday, Bloomberg News cited researchers who found that Grok users were generating up to 6,700 undressed images per hour.\n\nNwachukwu, an expert on AI governance and a longtime observer of and participant in social media safety initiatives, said that she first noticed requests along these lines from X users back in 2023.\n\nAt the time, she said, “Grok did not oblige the requests. It wasn’t really good at doing those things.” The bot’s responses began changing in 2024, and reached a critical mass late last year.\n\nIn October 2025, she noticed that “people were putting Halloween attire on themselves using Grok. Of course, a section of users realized we can also ask it to change what other people are wearing.” By year’s end, “there was a huge uptick in people asking Grok to put different people in bikinis or other types of suggestive clothing”.\n\nThere were other indications last year of an increased willingness to tolerate or even encourage the generation of sexually suggestive material with Grok.\n\nIn August, xAI incorporated a “spicy mode” setting in the mobile version of Grok’s text-to-video generation tool, leading the Verge to characterize it as “a service designed specifically to make suggestive videos”.\n\nNwachukwu’s data is just the latest indication of how the platform under Musk has become a magnet for forms of content that other platforms work to exclude, including hate speech, gore content and copyrighted material.\n\nOn Friday, Grok issued a bizarre public apology over the incident on X, claiming that “xAI is implementing stronger safeguards to prevent this”. On Tuesday, X Safety posted a promise to ban users who shared child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Musk himself said: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”\n\nNwachukwu said, however, that posts like those she has already collected are still appearing on the platform. Musk is giving “the middle finger to everyone who has asked for the platform to be moderated”, she said. The billionaire slashed Twitter’s trust and safety teams when he took over in 2022.\n\nShe added that other AI chatbots do not have the same issues.\n\n“Other generative AI platforms – ChatGPT or Gemini – they have safeguards,” she said. “If you ask them to generate something that looks like a person, it would never be a depiction of that person. They don’t generate depictions of real human beings.”\n\nThe revelations about the nonconsensual imagery on X has already drawn the attention of regulators in the UK, Europe, India, and Australia.\n\nNwachukwu, who is from Nigeria, pointed to a specific harm being done in the posts to “women from conservative societies”.\n\n“There’s a lot of targeting of people from conservative beliefs, conservative societies: west Africa, south Asia. This represents a different kind of harm for them,” she said.",

    "fullText": "Why did Lane Kiffin leave Ole Miss for LSU? Inside the controversial decision before College Football Playoff originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Ole Miss Rebels sit just two wins away from their first national championship in school history. Ole Miss’ playoff run has been surprising, as the team played most of the season without its head coach, Lane Kiffin.\n\nOver the past two months, Ole Miss navigated Kiffin leaving for LSU while installing a new head coach, Pete Golding. Despite the distractions, the team is 2-0 in the College Football Playoff, marking its first-ever postseason berth.\n\nLet’s take a look back at Kiffin’s dramatic decision to leave Ole Miss for LSU.\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal\n\nKiffin leaving Ole Miss for LSU was a weeks-long, drawn-out saga that only exists in a sport like college football. According to reports, Kiffin was lured away from Ole Miss with a massive NIL budget the Rebels could not match, among other perks.\n\nThe move was officially announced by LSU on Nov. 20, 2025, ending weeks of speculation and drama.\n\nMORE: A look at some of Lane Kiffin's early transfer portal losses in 2026\n\nLSU fired Brian Kelly on Oct. 26. Just a few weeks later on Nov. 17, Kiffin emerged as the Tigers' sole focus in their coaching search. In the days that followed, Kiffin's family was seen taking visits to Baton Rouge, as well as Gainesville, for the open Florida job.\n\nWhile Ole Miss reportedly wanted an answer from Kiffin on his future that week, the decision continued to drag on. The school reportedly gave Kiffin an ultimatum to make a decision before the Egg Bowl on Nov. 28, which Kiffin denied.\n\nAs his team was preparing for the Egg Bowl against Mississippi State, Kiffin declined to discuss his future during media availability. He did, however, reiterate how happy he was in Oxford.\n\nLane Kiffin: \"I love it here. It's been amazing and we're in the greatest run in the history of Ole Miss at this point... I'm just living in the moment.\"\n\n— Bryan Fischer (@BryanDFischer) November 19, 2025\n\n%3Cscript%20async%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.twitter.com%2Fwidgets.js%22%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E\n\nI asked Lane Kiffin if he expects to coach the Egg Bowl.\n\n\"Why would I not expect to coach next week? … We're gameplanning, we just practiced. I don't even understand how that would happen.\"\n\n— Chris Vannini (@ChrisVannini) November 19, 2025\n\nOn Nov. 20, a week before the Mississippi State game, Kiffin had a meeting with Ole Miss AD Keith Carter. Although a resolution or formal announcement was expected to come from it, Carter released a statement saying that a formal announcement would come after the Egg Bowl:\n\nLet’s lock in and focus on keeping the Golden Egg! pic.twitter.com/5xPfDozhl2\n\n— Keith Carter (@KeithCarterOM) November 21, 2025\n\nAlthough there were plenty of distractions surrounding Ole Miss in the days leading up to the Egg Bowl, the game was an important one. With a loss, Ole Miss was likely out of the CFP entirely. Although Kiffin didn't address his future, he did discuss the noise surrounding the program in the recent days:\n\n\"This noise ... this has been going on for weeks. This isn't new for us.\"\n\nLane Kiffin on the rumors swirling about where he'll coach next season 👀\n\n(via @SECNetwork)pic.twitter.com/hHJ6AIlHCA\n\n— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) November 28, 2025\n\nOle Miss defeated Mississippi State 38-19. After the game, Kiffin told ESPN sideline reporter Taylor McGregor that he was still unsure about what he was going to do about his future and that he would have \"a lot of praying\" to do as he made his decision.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon following the Egg Bowl, Kiffin met with the Ole Miss AD again. Although LSU remained 'very confident' it was going to land Kiffin, the prolonging of a decision put things slightly in doubt.\n\nIn the evening hours, LSU reportedly finalizing its deals with Kiffin was delayed by Ole Miss' playoff hopes. It was later reported that Kiffin wanted to finish the season with Ole Miss through its playoff run, while simultaneously threatening to poach players if he could not.\n\nCBS Sports later confirmed reports of Kiffin threatening to take players and staff to LSU with him:\n\nThe Ole Miss coach wasn't going to leave for Baton Rouge without a fight, though. In a conversation described as tense, Kiffin didn't want to back down from his desire to coach the team through the postseason.\n\nWhen Ole Miss showed no interest in allowing him to do so, Kiffin, according to sources, threatened to take the offensive staff with him immediately if Carter and Boyce didn't relent. They held firm; Kiffin would not be coaching the team in the playoff.\n\nAs word of Kiffin's tactics spread, multiple Ole Miss football players confronted him in his office Sunday about it. Kiffin refused to directly answer whether he had told his on-field offensive staffers that if they didn't get on the plane with him to Baton Rouge the next day, they wouldn't have a spot on his LSU staff.\n\n\"I'm not making them go,\" Kiffin told the players. \"They can do whatever they want.\"\n\nSunday morning on Nov. 30 still had plenty of drama. A 9a.m. central time team meeting Kiffin had scheduled was pushed to 1 p.m.. By 3 p.m. Eastern, Kiffin made it official with an announcement via X:\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) November 30, 2025\n\nGreeted with boos and middle fingers from Ole Miss fans, Kiffin boarded a private plane to Baton Rouge. During an interview with ESPN's Marty Smith, Kiffin stated that although he wanted to coach the team through the playoff, he respected the school's decision\n\nMy interview with @Lane_Kiffin prior to his departure from Oxford to Baton Rouge.\n\n•Why he chose LSU over Ole Miss\n•Why he wasn’t in Sunday’s Ole Miss team meeting\n•His response to not coaching Ole Miss in the playoff\n•Why this took so long\n•Peter Carroll’s important msg pic.twitter.com/GfBkE7fnHU\n\n— Marty Smith (@MartySmithESPN) December 1, 2025\n\nEven after Kiffin was officially introduced at LSU, he touched on his tough decision to leave Ole Miss, as well as his desire to coach the Rebels through the playoff.\n\n\"Extremely difficult decision,\" Kiffin said in his introductory presser at LSU the following Monday. \"In that, we tried every single thing possible to continue to coach the team through the playoffs and to continue to coach the players. In the end that was their decision, and we totally respect that and appreciate the time and energy that we tried to figure out a plan to do the best thing at the time for those players.\"\n\nKiffin leaving Ole Miss didn't come as much of a surprise. LSU, one of the best college football jobs in the country, has the type of talent and resources that Ole Miss simply cannot match. In his presser, Kiffin added that he relied on mentors like Pete Carroll, who channeled his father, Monte Kiffin.\n\n\"I felt like everybody that I talked to outside of the state that I was in all basically said the same thing, Kiffin said. \"They all said, man, you are going to regret it if you don’t take the shot and you don’t go to LSU. It’s the best job in America with the best resources and to win it. It’s obviously been done here before by a number of people.\n\n\"Pete Carroll, really he told me that he always told my dad that he would look out for me. When we were talking, he really channelled him from knowing him for so long, and he said, this is exactly what he would do. He would tell you, boy, go get it; go for it.\"\n\nAlthough several Ole Miss assistants followed Kiffin to Baton Rouge, including offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr., running backs coach Chris Smith and linebackers coach and tight ends coach Joe Cox, only a few are remaining with the team through Thursday's Fiesta Bowl.\n\nPer ESPN on Jan.6, Weis Jr. and Smith are expected to continue coaching Ole Miss against Miami on Thursday evening. Other assistants that followed Kiffin like Cox and receivers coach George McDonald are expected to stay behind.\n\nMORE:Ranking the four remaining 2025 College Football Playoff\n\nLane Kiffin signed a seven-year, $13 million contract with LSU, which will earn him close to $91 million. His new salary makes him one of college football's highest-paid head coaches, right there with Georgia's Kirby Smart.\n\nOle Miss reportedly was set to match LSU's reported offerings around $13 million a year, but it's unclear if the numbers matched LSU's exactly.\n\nKiffin's salary in 2025 was right at $9 million per USA Today, which made him the 11th highest-paid head coach in college football. According to the Clarion Ledger, Kiffin signed a six-year extension worth $54 million in 2023 with Ole Miss.\n\nAlthough the numbers for 2025-26 aren't public just yet,  LSU reportedly also is set to commit $25-30 million per year for roster-building with Kiffin.\n\nA 2024 estimate had Ole Miss' roster from last season costing $10 million. You can guesstimate that number is higher for big-name stars like Trinidad Chambliss, Kewan Lacy and others, but it's nowhere close to LSU's reported commitment under Kiffin.\n\nKiffin compiled a 55-19 overall record in six seasons at Ole Miss, and he left as the school's third winningest head coach.\n\nMORE: Bowl season winners & losers",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere did Trinidad Chambliss play D2 football?\n\nTrinidad Chambliss stats at Ferris State\n\nFerris State national championship teams\n\nWhen did Trinidad Chambliss leave Ferris State?\n\nPrior to becoming Ole Miss’ star quarterback and leading the school to the College Football Playoff, Trinidad Chambliss played Division II college football. Originally from Grand Rapids, Mich., Chambliss was an unrated recruit coming out of high school and started his college career at Ferris State due to a lack of Division I offers.\n\nHe spent four seasons under longtime Ferris State coach Tony Anesse, although he was the team’s starter for only one season. Here’s a look back at Chambliss’ Ferris State career before arriving at Ole Miss.\n\nMORE:How Trinidad Chambliss went from Ferris State to SEC's 2025 breakout star\n\nTrinidad Chambliss played DII football at Ferris State. The program is led by head coach Tony Annese, who first arrived at the program in 2012. He's taken the program to new heights, including back-to-back national titles in 2021 and 2022, and two other consecutive national championships in 2024 and 2025, the latter of which was won by Chambliss under center.\n\nOver his 13 seasons with the Bulldogs, Annese has compiled an impressive 153-21 record. He has also helped Ferris State take home seven GLIAC titles, including its first since 1999. The Bulldogs also reached the national title game in 2018.\n\nMORE: What do Ole Miss fans mean when they say \"Hotty Toddy\"\n\nFerris State is located in Big Rapids, Mich., about 56 miles north of Grand Rapids, where Chambliss grew up. In high school, Chambliss played both basketball and football for Forest Hills High School in Grand Rapids. As a senior in 2020-21, he helped lead his basketball team to a state semifinal appearance.\n\nHe signed with Ferris State’s class of 2021 but didn’t see significant playing time until his junior season in 2024.\n\nMORE:More on Trinidad Chambliss' Michigan roots\n\nChambliss became the Bulldogs' starter in 2024, and helped lead Ferris State to a national title. He threw for 2,925 with 26 touchdowns and just six interceptions, and Ferris State defeated Valdosta State 49-14 in the title game. Chambliss threw three touchdowns passes and rushed for another two in the win.\n\nChambliss was part of two national championship teams as a backup quarterback in 2021 and 2022. He led Ferris State to its third national title in four seasons as the starter in 2024.\n\nFerris State's strong reputation has continued since Chambliss left for Ole Miss. The 2025 Bulldogs finished as national champs with a perfect 16-0 record, capped off with a 42-21 win over Harding in the national title game.\n\nMORE:Meet Pete Golding, the man that replaced Lane Kiffin at Ole Miss\n\nAlthough he received an influx of interest from schools after winning a national title for Ferris State in mid-December 2024, Chambliss didn't enter the winter transfer portal window.\n\nBut as more schools started reaching out and offering him life-changing NIL opportunities in the spring, he saw it as an opportunity he couldn't pass up. He entered the spring transfer portal window—which has since been limited by the NCAA to just one window in January—in April 2025. He committed to Ole Miss and the Rebels a couple of weeks later.\n\nHe even began the 2025 season behind Ole Miss quarterback Austin Simmons but earned the starting job after Simmons got injured in Week 3. He's thrown for a career-high 3,660 yards with 21 touchdowns and three interceptions at Ole Miss.",

    "description": "Common Gap links high school graduates to paid jobs at startups as an alternative to attending college.",
    "fullText": "The college application season is well underway, and high school seniors are facing some big decisions. Chief among them: What about a gap year?\n\nNow, a new program wants to formalize that path. Common Gap, launching Thursday, aims to match ambitious teens taking a year off before or during college with startup jobs.\n\nDelaying, dropping out of, or skipping college altogether have long been popular in Silicon Valley. Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Larry Ellison have all done some version of it. As artificial intelligence hype draws young founders to San Francisco, programs at companies like Palantir Technologies are rolling out anti-college initiatives for high school graduates. Meanwhile, startup entrepreneurship programs like Y Combinator skew increasingly younger, as taking a gap year has become less contrarian and more mainstream for aspiring technocrats.\n\nAs part of Common Gap's program, participating startups must agree to pay the high school graduates at least $75,000 a year. Oliver Zhou, the founder of the initiative, expects most offers will exceed $100,000. Common Gap doesn't have its own funding, since the participating companies will pay the students' salaries, and it won't turn a profit.\n\nZhou sees early-career prospects as a major unlock in the AI talent race, which last summer sent offers for the most technical machine learning roles into the millions: \"Why wait for them to graduate?\" He told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nZhou, 24, wishes he had taken a gap year. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania a year early and founded Deep24, a Y Combinator-backed startup that analyzes productivity data to help users manage their time effectively, in 2024. He also previously worked as a product manager at Uber.\n\n\"If you choose to go to college, you're going very intentionally,\" he said of those who will complete the Common Gap.\n\nCommon Gap takes its name from the Common App, a platform used by college-bound students to apply to over 1,000 schools with one application.\n\nPrograms for early-career techies aren't necessarily new. The Thiel Fellowship, founded in 2011, awards early-stage founders $200,000 and requires participants to drop out of college. Some venture capital firms, like Kleiner Perkins, have programs like the Common Gap, which matches college students with internships at startups in their portfolios.\n\nSeveral startups have already signed on with Common Gap, including Austin-based SuperBuilders, which makes technology for Alpha School, an AI-powered private school. Many other partners are AI-focused — a health tech company, an insurance startup, and Zhou's Deep24. His company and others in Common Gap went through the Silicon Valley entrepreneurship program Y Combinator. Zhou is working on programming for participants who will work at San Francisco-based startups.\n\nThe application process will skip the traditional résumé drop and instead asks applicants to share \"the most impressive thing you've done or built,\" Zhou said, with an optional video interview component. Zhou is also considering using AI as an initial filter in early interview rounds.\n\n\"I certainly think that college is not right for everyone, and it has kind of become a default,\" he said. \"Being able to do real work, rather than just turning in assignments for someone to grade, is quite rewarding — and good learning.\"",

Is it only when a team loses, or does a Cinderella run end when the Cinderella becomes favored?\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes have sprung two upsets already in the College Football Playoff, but they are now favored against the Mississippi Rebels in the first semifinal.\n\nMy Miami vs. Mississippi predictions and college football picks lean heavily on Cinderella, even if Cinderella is now favored.\n\nKickoff comes at 7:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, January 8.\n\nThe thought of Miami reaching the national championship game after its questionable inclusion in the College Football Playoff should make Notre Dame fans and BYU fans livid. Yet, here we are.\n\nThe Hurricanes’ defense is distinctly the best unit in this game, and it is playing at its best of the season. Meanwhile, the Rebels’ offense is losing assistants with each round of the Playoff, courtesy of former head coach Lane Kiffin.\n\nThat matchup should dictate this game, lending itself to a Miami win and a continued Cinderella-ish run.\n\nMississippi may have the best offensive line that Miami has faced yet in the Playoff, but with how defensive ends Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor are playing, that should not matter. Furthermore, Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss is less of a scramble threat than Texas A&M’s Marcel Reed and less adept at getting rid of the ball under pressure than Ohio State’s Julian Sayin.\n\nExpect the Miami Hurricanes’ defensive front to make Chambliss look like a Division II quarterback while Miami’s offense enjoys facing the worst defense it has seen in the Playoff.\n\nMiami's offense might not look outright good in this matchup, but it should look better than it has yet in the Playoff. This is the worst defense it has faced thus far. Furthermore, shortening the game with a heavy dosage of Mark Fletcher Jr. will only help the Hurricanes' defensive front.\n\nMark Fletcher Jr. Over 88.5 rushing yards\n\nMalachi Toney anytime touchdown\n\nAny Miami faith should also go hand in hand with the Under. Handing off to Mark Fletcher Jr. will help keep Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss off the field; it will also keep the Hurricanes' defensive line more aggressive.\n\nMark Fletcher Jr. Over 88.5 Rushing Yards\n\nSpread: Miami -3.5 | Mississippi +3.5\n\nMoneyline: Miami -164 | Mississippi +138\n\nOver/Under: Over 51.5 | Under 51.5\n\nMiami is 2-0 against the spread this season as a one-score favorite and 4-1 ATS as a one-score favorite in the last three seasons.

    "title": "The college-to-office path is dead: CEO of the world’s biggest recruiter says Gen Z grads need to consider trade and hospitality jobs that don’t even require degrees",
    "description": "Struggling Gen Z and millennial grads should consider turning their back on their degrees and retraining to become hospitality and trade workers, Randstad’s CEO warns.",
    "fullText": "Millions of Gen Zers are facing unemployment as entry-level office roles get absorbed by AI, and millennials are regretting taking out thousands in student loans for careers that now have significantly diminished prospects. Now, the CEO of the world’s biggest talent company, Randstad, has confirmed what many young grads are already fearing: The traditional college-to-office pipeline is dead.\n\n“People need to reflect on—taking a student loan, going to college and being trained or educated for a profession that is rapidly changing—whether that’s still the right path,” Sander van ’t Noordende, the global CEO of Randstad, told Fortune.\n\n“We all grew up, with our parents saying, ‘go do something in college or university and then do something in an office,’ that path that used to work for a long time is starting to break,” he added.\n\n“You already see that with the graduates finding it harder to find a job. You see that in professions like marketing, communications, design… just look at how good AI already is at some of that.”\n\nUnder his helm, the staffing company places around half a million workers in jobs every week—and he has bad news for those who have already forked out thousands for their degree in the hopes of nabbing a cushy office role: You may have more luck landing bartending, barista, or building jobs.\n\nTech leaders have consistently warned that AI is already as good as entry-level workers and that it could halve white-collar jobs by 2030. In fact, a “first-of-its-kind” Stanford University study has warned that the new technology is already having “significant and disproportionate impact” on Gen Z. Bartenders and baristas are even seeing bigger pay raises than desk workers, right now.\n\n“Jobs will change—and are changing—but also new jobs will emerge,” van ’t Noordende echoed. “There is a massive demand in skilled trades, mechanical engineers, machine operators, maintenance engineers, forklift drivers, truck drivers—you name it.”\n\nWith the white-collar job market seemingly frozen, van ’t Noordende said it’s no longer “good advice” to tell young people to follow their passions.\n\n“No, learn a craft or a trade or a skill or a profession, where you can make a good living and provide for you and your family, is much better advice than follow your passion.”\n\nFurther making his case: The U.K. government has just announced it’ll be splurging $965 million into apprenticeships to help place tens of thousands of unemployed young people into the jobs that they think are the future—and they’re all in hospitality, retail, and AI.\n\nBut for those hell-bent on going to college, van ’t Noordende stressed that STEM subjects—which are studied in China at twice the rate of the U.S. and parts of Europe—will likely remain in demand.\n\nAnd his advice to those who’ve already wasted time and money on a degree that’s dwindling in relevance? “Retrain. Learning new skills always good.”\n\n“Look around you, and where you see the opportunities that match with your skills and your background and go there,” van ’t Noordende added. But he warned that at some point, you may just “have to bite the bullet and say, ‘Okay, this is not working.’”\n\nThe CEO stressed that you’re not alone; many people are currently doing exactly that. And that ultimately, going from a desk job to becoming a plumber, teacher, or nurse, van ’t Noordende says, requires a mindset shift. It’s not a failure if you end up doing work outside your field of study—it’s just adjusting to what actually works. “You have to come off your chair and build skills,” he added.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "I developed stabbing stomach pain as a college football player. It turned out to be stage 4 colon cancer.",
    "description": "Khalil Smith thought he was just training hard and adjusting to college life. It turned out his stabbing stomach pains were a result of colon cancer.",
    "fullText": "It felt like someone was stabbing me in the stomach.\n\nAt the time, there were plenty of halfway reasonable explanations why my stomach might be hurting. Maybe it's a cold. Maybe I have the flu. Maybe this is just me getting used to college food. Or maybe I just got punched in the stomach a few too many times.\n\nI was a 19-year-old freshman running back at West Virginia Wesleyan College. Living away from home, training hard, studying, there were bound to be reasons why my stomach hurt. Except this hurt just wouldn't go away.\n\nFor more than six months, I was living with a strange kind of persistent, stabbing pain that would return again and again through the course of the day. It didn't seem to matter if I popped a Tums or changed what I ate. It's hard to put food down when it feels like you're being consistently pummeled from the inside. The pain got so bad that I was subsisting on a diet of little more than chocolate milk and mixed fruit from the dining hall.\n\nI knew I was getting skinnier, but I thought, \"Hey, that's what training hard can do.\" It's not uncommon to lose a little weight during football season.\n\nIt wasn't until the springtime, after I'd turned 20, that I realized how serious the weight loss had gotten. My friends and I were home messing around, cracking jokes, and jumping on the scale to see who'd lost and gained weight since college started. I stepped on the scale, and it registered 155 pounds. I had lost 30 pounds in half a year. That's when my dad called the doctor and made sure I got an appointment the next day.\n\nAfter a few visits, doctors discovered I was bleeding internally, and I was sent to the hospital for tests, including a colonoscopy. They couldn't even get the camera through my colon during the exam, because it was completely blocked. Later on, doctors told me my tumors were as big as a pineapple. Five pounds worth, and two of them had broken open and were spreading.\n\nI had stage four cancer — it was aggressive, and it was traveling throughout my body.\n\nHow could this be happening? I was a young college athlete, just out of high school, and a pretty healthy guy. How could I have late-stage colon cancer?\n\nBut I did. And I'm not alone. More and more, doctors are diagnosing young people with late-stage, aggressive colon cancers like mine, occurring decades earlier than what's \"normal,\" and catching everyone by surprise.\n\nGetting cancer felt like getting my free will ripped away from me. I lived in the hospital, underwent major surgery, got my insides stripped out, and then had a colostomy bag put in temporarily to deal with my waste. It was isolating, and I felt like I was living in a different universe.\n\nAfterwards, once the colostomy bag was removed and I was able to go to the bathroom on my own again, I had to get a physical therapist just to re-learn how to do the simple things in life. Things that weren't easy to me anymore included getting up, using the toilet, or having the ability to just move around the way I used to.\n\nOn top of that, I was outfitted with a port for chemotherapy infusions, lost my hair, and dealt with how those toxic treatments completely sap your energy.\n\nAnd yet, even after all the treatment was over, doctors were still finding more cancer in my body. They did one more major surgery, put in another temporary colostomy bag, and tried a new kind of chemotherapy. Six more months of treatment. The cancer still wasn't eradicated. At this point in time, I'd done two major surgeries and 12 rounds of chemo, and the doctors were still telling me, \"Well, we have to do another surgery and a different type of chemo.\"\n\nMy faith in my oncologist was waning, my frustration mounting. I'm thinking: You keep telling me if I do these things, I'm going to be all right, and it's going to be gone, but it's the same cycle over and over again. I was starting to feel like a test patient.\n\nThat's when, with some help from my football coaches, I sought a second opinion out of state. Finally, I was tested for Lynch syndrome, the genetic condition sometimes called \"cancer family syndrome\" or \"hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\" because of how it predisposes people to several kinds of cancers, but especially colon cancer, usually in their 40s and 50s.\n\nOnce I had my proper diagnosis, the disease became easier to treat. Oncologists have recently discovered how well Lynch syndrome responds to immunotherapy, where you recruit your own immune system to recognize and fight cancer, sometimes without any need for toxic radiation or chemotherapy.\n\nI went back to my doctor again, who agreed to take a different approach and do immunotherapy this time, with no chemo required. The difference was amazing. Instead of lying in bed all day, exhausted, I was able to live a relatively normal life during this round of treatment. I wouldn't say my energy was 100%, but maybe 80%, which is a really major improvement from life during chemo.\n\nI not only felt better, but I was also getting better. Doctors were able to stop my immunotherapy treatments completely in mid-2024, and I've been all clear since then.\n\nI still get scans about every three months. I know I'll have to be vigilant; my condition puts me at a lifelong higher risk of developing cancer because the mutations that are built into my DNA make it easier for the disease to sprout up.\n\nSchool was my much-needed dose of normalcy through all of the cancer treatment. I told myself I was still going to graduate on time, even if I couldn't be an athlete. My doctors suggested taking a break to heal, and while I understood where they were coming from, I just knew for my own mental health I had to maintain at least some of the \"normal\" things in life while I was a cancer patient. It helped me stay motivated, knowing that at least I could still graduate on time, even if I couldn't play football.\n\nI also kept on working out, getting in regular exercise throughout my treatments. Even when I was getting chemotherapy infusions, I'd strap on a bag to let the chemo drip into me while I moved around, and head to the track for three to five miles of walking. Some days I could only walk very slowly, others it was a brisk pace, depending on my energy. I think the movement really helped manage the side effects, making them milder. Even though I did have some symptoms, and chemo was rough, I felt like keeping my body active and getting that blood flowing and moving around was so beneficial.\n\nAfter two years off the field, with a clean bill of health, I returned to the football team my senior year. It felt good to be back on the field, but my body was not the same anymore.\n\nI have issues with neuropathy, a type of treatment-related nerve damage that makes my hands and feet tingle and go numb. This makes me hyper-sensitive to cold temperatures, making it hard to drive a car when it's cold out or even open up the freezer and pull something out. It's kind of hard to catch a football when you can't really feel your hands, or run when your feet are numb. Eventually, I decided it was time to quit the sport I love, but it felt good doing it on my own terms, and playing for one last season.\n\nI still work out almost every day, but it's not the same as having a team sport. I've started some personal training, training people who were inspired by how well I recovered and how much muscle I was able to build back after my treatments.\n\nI have also changed my diet. After living with a colostomy bag a few times and seeing exactly what comes out of your body after you eat, you start to think about food differently. Some of that stuff is not being digested at all, especially the artificial colors in brightly colored cereals. I don't eat as much junk food or cereal as I used to, in part because seeing those bright blue, purple, and green colors coming out of my body scared me straight. I try to stick to a diet that's good for muscle building and longevity, mainly focusing on lean proteins like chicken and fish, plus lots of leafy greens, with room for a little bit of red meat now and then to keep my iron levels up, but not as much as I used to eat.\n\nI hope my story can be helpful to others going through cancer treatment. I have run a few clothing drives, and donate to my local hospital just so cancer patients like me can have snacks and blankets, comfortable stuff while they're waiting around.\n\nI know how it can feel when your family is going through such a hard time. It's always good to have somebody see you, someone who has experienced it, to help you get through a tough time.",

    "title": "Couch: Lansing Community College's nationally ranked women's basketball team has reloaded, with one goal",
    "description": "The No. 9-ranked Stars bolstered their schedule and expanded their talent base in an effort to achieve the goal that's eluded them the last two years.",
    "fullText": "LANSING — For Lansing Community College’s women’s basketball program, the previous two seasons were a combination of wonder and winning, building and bonding. The rebirth of the Stars’ program under Megan Hudson has been an awesome story.\n\nBut it’s also twice finished in frustration and heartbreak, back-to-back 25-win seasons ending a win shy of the NJCAA Division II national tournament.\n\nAll you have to do is look at the schedule and the roster this season to know there’s one goal: Get to the national tournament.\n\n“100%. It’s eyes on the prize,” Hudson said, midway through her third season.\n\n“I mean, it’s everything,” said sophomore point guard Claire Tobias, from Holt.\n\nThe Stars are 11-2 entering Wednesday night’s home game against Jackson College (5:30 p.m., Gannon Gymnasium). Jackson beat them in the district championship two years ago. LCC then begins conference play at home Saturday against Glen Oaks Community College (1 p.m., Gannon Gymnasium).\n\nThe LCC men, also off to a good start (9-4), host Mott at 7:30 on Wednesday and Glen Oaks at 3 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThat non-conference record by the LCC women has been earned this season. Hudson challenged her team in ways she hadn’t the first two years — playing three straight ranked teams in three days at a tournament at St. Clair County in November, beating two of them and losing a competitive game to now-No. 2 Illinois Central, then playing at No. 6 Schoolcraft, losing by four, before winning three games at an event in Florida in December, including over No. 12 Parkland.\n\nAll of it has put the Stars firmly on the national radar, ranked No. 9 nationally in the latest poll, which came out Tuesday.\n\nIt’s the respect Hudson has been seeking. “Because I feel the basketball we’re playing is on that level,” she said.\n\n“I have been trying to figure out the formula for national competition, to continue to grow, to get to a space that we can make the national tournament and, when we get there, we can compete nationally,” Hudson continued. “And it was clearly articulated to me that you need to travel to play outside of your region and you have to play ranked teams.”\n\nShe was told that by fellow coaches and, not in so many words, by the NJCAA tournament selection committee, which didn’t give the Stars one of the few at-large bids when they fell to Schoolcraft last March in their district championship game.\n\nHudson also knew that she needed to challenge this particular team early, a squad with 10 freshmen.\n\n“I knew that I had a very young team coming in, a very, very talented young team coming in,” Hudson said, “and that they need to understand what that landscape looks like, and to play the best of the best and to be able to compete at that level.”\n\nHudson’s team still has a local flare to it — Tobias, sophomore post Ashlynn Putman (Mason), redshirt-sophomore Ivana McCollum (Waverly), along with freshmen guards Sophie Klinger (East Lansing) and Jocelyn Kotowicz (St. Johns) are all regular contributors, with Tobias and Putman starting all 13 games.\n\nBut Hudson’s recruiting reach has expanded significantly — to Detroit, Flint, Bay City, Berrien Springs, Kansas, Texas.\n\nThe foundation and culture built the last two seasons has made LCC an attractive destination and the recruiting pitch easier.\n\nFor example, transfer Destiny Ochs, a 5-foot-9 wing from Topeka, Kansas, found LCC on her own, first by poking around the NJCAA website.\n\n“Lansing stood out to me,” Ochs said. “I looked them up, and the school popped out to me. I could tell they're really focused on their education, they looked like they had a good basketball program they were building. And I just looked at their Twitter, too. And I saw that they're committing a lot more girls. It’s more of a diverse team than it was last year. So I was just really interested. I reached out from there.”\n\nHudson emailed her back the next day and the recruitment blossomed.\n\nFreshman power forward and center Aubreona Smith — affectionally known to her teammates as “Smitty” — met Hudson after one of her games at Berrien Springs. There were a number of coaches there to see her, but she and Hudson connected right away.\n\n“She stood out the most to me,” Smith said. “I feel like you should go somewhere you’re wanted and not just be a number.”\n\nShe liked that LCC had a psychology program and felt like home. And, “I like to win.”\n\nThis is no longer just a dream. Nor just a feel-good story. Hudson has something to sell, proof of concept, and can be choosy in who she recruits, as well.\n\nHer first two teams were talented in their own right. This one is deeper — 13 deep regularly.\n\n“I have easily seven different kids that could go off for 20 (points) on any given night,” Hudson said.\n\n“We have so many guards this year, they just love to run,” Tobias added. “We have so many people coming off the bench, if one person's tired, we have another one just as fast. We outrun everyone. I love that feeling, as someone who just loves to push the ball up (the court). … And Smitty coming in, her and Ash (Putman) being our bigs have been great.”\n\nSmith are Putman are part of a balanced scoring attack, with Putman leading the team at 11.3 points per game (an 8.2 rebounds), with Smith at 10.8 (and 7.8 rebounds). Armonie Smith, a 5-9 freshman guard from Flint, averages 11.2 points, with freshman guard Demi Bolton, who played at Ferndale, at 9.1 per game. Tobias averages 7.6 points and team-leading 2.4 assists. Freshman Georgia Kuyers — who followed former LCC star Kara Bartels (now at CMU) from Zeeland West — is averaging 6.7 rebounds in 17.3 minutes. Nine players are averaging 15 minutes or more per game, with Putnam and Tobias the only two over 20.\n\n“I think our athleticism and the fact that we can go so deep in the roster, that's been a little bit different. … That's helped us this year,” Putman said.\n\nAlso helping — even when it doesn’t feel like it: the travel and the schedule.\n\n“I think it was necessary,” Putman said. “It was hard at times, and obviously we dropped a couple (games) to the Illinois (Central) team and Schoolcraft. But playing the high-caliber teams early and getting a feel for that early, I think is beneficial for us when we go down the road and play at regionals and nationals.”\n\n“We we feel like we have figured out the recipe a bit on getting the girls ready for what that's going to feel like in a different way than we have in the past,” Hudson said, “what it feels like to play multiple games back to back, what it feels like to be in high-pressure situations and make better decisions, and you don't get that if you're not playing the best.”\n\nAs the goal has become more focused, Hudson and her staff have tried to make sure this is still an inviting program and an atmosphere that isn’t entirely about winning under pressure. For example, they take dance breaks during workouts — where one player teaches the rest of the team a dance. They give each other verbal flowers after every practice. It’s still a mom and pop operation, too — literally. Hudson’s mother, Pat Feehery, buys the team snacks.\n\nAt the community college level, there’s always a ton a newness. Maintaining culture and leadership comes down to the staff and your sophomores.\n\n“I've been very, very pleased with our (group),” Hudson said, also happy that her team posted a 3.3 first-semester GPA, the highest in her time with the program. “The sophomores have been outstanding, major anchors to what we're doing here. The freshmen, to have the mentality they have, is fun to see.”\n\nContract Graham Couch at gcouch@lsj.com.

    "fullText": "AJ Dybantsa has lived up to his billing this season as the potential No. 1 overall selection in the 2026 NBA draft. The BYU 18-year-old freshman — originally from Brockton — is dominating college basketball defenders at the moment.\n\nEarlier in the season, Dybantsa dropped 25 points at Madison Square Garden in front of Jaylen Brown and Derrick White in attendance, and AJ has stockpiled those kinds of scoring performances as the season has gone on.\n\nBleacher Report’s Andy Bailey recently predicted that Dybantsa will indeed be the first pick in the draft, despite competition from two other guys.\n\n“Right now, there are three very real contenders to be the top pick in the 2026 draft: Cameron Boozer, Darryn Peterson and AJ Dybantsa,” Bailey wrote on January 1.\n\n“All three have been incredibly productive as freshmen. And the talent gaps between them (assuming there are any) are small enough that it might come down to which team wins the lottery.”\n\n“If someone needs a bigger forward, Boozer would be the pick,” Bailey continued. “A team in need of a dynamic lead guard could go with Peterson. But Dybantsa checks boxes that both of the others do, and wing is the easiest player archetype to build around. And if Dybantsa keeps playing through conference games the way he has in his last six appearances (when he’s averaged 27.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 2.3 steals), he’ll enter the summer with a ton of momentum.”\n\nPotential No. 1 pick AJ Dybantsa's last 7 games:\n\n24 PTS | 8-15 FG | 8 REB | 3 AST\n33 PTS | 11-13 FG | 10 REB | 10 AST\n35 PTS | 9-12 FG | 6 REB | 4 AST\n23 PTS | 8-14 FG | 10 REB\n26 PTS | 11-17 FG | 8 REB | 7 AST\n28 PTS | 9-17 FG | 9 REB | 6 AST\n22 PTS | 10-15 FG | 5 REB | 5 AST pic.twitter.com/2LkrcwPCqO\n\n— B/R Hoops (@brhoops) January 3, 2026\n\nDybantsa has electrified BYU basketball in his first 14 games played. The 6-foot-8 wing, a preseason AP All-American, joined the Cougars after reclassifying and committing in late 2024.\n\nEarly on in the season, Dybantsa faced challenges, including a narrow 86-84 loss to UConn where he contributed despite team struggles. But he ignited in December. His standout effort came against Clemson on December 9, engineering a 22-point comeback by scoring or assisting on 34 of BYU’s 45 second-half points in a 67-64 victory. He followed with a career-high 35 points versus Abilene Christian and made NCAA history on December 23 against Eastern Washington, posting the youngest-ever 30-point triple-double: 33 points on 11-of-13 shooting, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists.\n\nEntering Big 12 play, Dybantsa earned Lute Olson National Player of the Week on December 15 and Big 12 Player of the Week on December 30. In the conference opener on January 3, he scored 24 points despite seven turnovers, leading No. 10 BYU to an 83-73 road win over Kansas State, extending their streak to 10 victories. Through early January, he’s averaging 23.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 3.8 assists on 59.1 percent shooting, positioning BYU as a Final Four contender while solidifying his NBA Draft stock.\n\nLeBron James Retirement Timeline Predicted By Andy Bailey",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's first-year head coach gave the LSU Tigers men's basketball program a first-hand look at what \"Bucky Ball\" is all about, as the Aggies captured their first Southeastern Conference win of the Bucky McMillan era at Reed Arena on Saturday.\n\nThe Maroon and White commanded the lead for the majority of the contest, but a late charge by Matt McMahon's squad resulted in a back-and-forth battle in the closing moments of the contest. Another outstanding performance from Rashaun Agee helped send the Tigers back to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with their first loss of conference play, as the graduate forward secured a double-double by leading the team with 15 points and 11 rebounds in the 75-72 win over LSU.

    "description": "Purdue's defense has been tight, and our expert college basketball predictions expect the Boilermakers to win tonight's Big 10 matchup by a wide margin.",
    "fullText": "No. 5 Purdue Boilermakers has revenge on its mind as it opens the new year against the Wisconsin Badgers.\n\nDespite being favored, the Boilermakers have lost their last two to Wisconsin and three straight to the Badgers ATS. In fact, Wisconsin has ATS wins in six of the last seven over Purdue as underdogs.\n\nWisconsin, meanwhile, needs an impressive win after losing to highly ranked foes in the non-conference schedule.\n\nOur Purdue vs. Wisconsin predictions and college basketball picks believe the Boilermakers will get what they want, covering on the road.\n\nPurdue vs Wisconsin best bet: Purdue -5.5 (-115)\n\nThe 12-1 Purdue Boilermakers have the most efficient offense in the nation. Since an early-December loss to Iowa State, Purdue has also stepped up its defense.\n\nAgainst the four opponents since then — a list that includes Quad I Auburn, as well as Minnesota and Marquette — Purdue has not allowed more than 60 points.\n\nThe Boilermakers held all four to fewer than .93 points per possession. After allowing teams to shoot .495 from two and .321 from three through the Iowa State game, Purdue has allowed opponents a .422 rate from two and .259 from three.\n\nAs a result, they've won all four games by between 28 and 51 points.\n\nThat means Purdue has more Quad I wins in the last four games — and as many power-conference wins — as the Wisconsin Badgers have managed all season.\n\nThe Badgers are 0-3 against Quad I foes, 0-4 if you consider that TCU was Quad I when it won by 11, only to slip to Quad II since.\n\nWisconsin failed to cover all four games and lost them all by double digits, including a 28-point loss to BYU and a 30-point defeat at Nebraska.\n\nWisconsin has been middle-of-the-road in most defensive measures, which already spells doom in the Big Ten.\n\nHowever, against elite teams, that defense slips to downright awful. The Badgers rank No. 172 in the nation, allowing foes to shoot .334 from three.\n\nTheir four top-shelf opponents shot .403. From the two-point range, Wisconsin shoots 49.6%, No. 114 in the country. Their four best foes shot .521.\n\nPurdue plays at the No. 309-ranked tempo in the nation. In their last 10 head-to-head matchups, Purdue and Wisconsin have had an Over/Under points line of 150.5 once.\n\nPurdue has gone Under in five of its last six games, including three times with an Over/Under below 153.5. Wisconsin has been under in the last two games and three of the previous four.\n\nNolan Winter has scored in double figures in six straight and averaged 18.3 in his last three. He scored 14 against BYU and 23 against Villanova, so he's not just bullying mid-major big men.\n\nFletcher Loyer is Purdue's leading scorer, but he's been a bit of a bully this season, piling on the points against low-level foes.\n\nMeanwhile, his four lowest-scoring games came against Purdue’s Quad I opponents: 7 points vs. Alabama, 10 vs. Texas Tech, 5 vs. Iowa State, and 8 vs. Auburn.\n\nFletcher Loyer Under 13.5 points\n\nSpread: Purdue -8.5 (-110) | Wisconsin +8.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Purdue -265 | Wisconsin +225\n\nOver/Under: Over 153.5 (-105) | Under 153.5 (-115)\n\nPurdue has hit the game total Under in nine of its last 12 road games.

    "description": "Readers of the L.A. Times Sports section share their thoughts on USC losing in the Alamo Bowl, Lincoln Riley's coaching job, college bowl games, the Lakers and Bill Plaschke.",
    "fullText": "It's very obvious to this USC diehard fan, Lincoln Riley is not delivering on his commitment to restore Trojans football to national prominence as head coach.\n\nStop promising better results, hiring new assistant coaches, and commenting on the difficulty of the schedule.\n\nAfter USC lost to unranked Texas Christian in the Alamo Bowl to finish a 9-4 season, coach Lincoln Riley said, \"The arrow is pointing straight up.\" He apparently didn't receive a compass for Christmas.\n\nIf USC plays again in the Alamo Bowl, the Trojans should bring their own officials. ’Nuf said.\n\nAfter losing to TCU in overtime, the Trojans will always \"Remember the Alamo (Bowl).\" With that, the Men of Troy seem to break my heart every football season. Not playing Notre Dame anymore is sacrilegious. Last but not least, Lincoln Riley is an overrated head football coach. Fight On!\n\nThe Ohio State University loses the big playoff game and Ole Miss advances without former coach Lane Kiffin. I imagine millions, like me, hope Ole Miss will win the whole thing without Kiffin.\n\nTimes sports columnist Bill Plaschke appropriately describes how unique and beautiful the Rose Bowl is as a football venue. However, he’s completely off base to advocate for the CFP national championship game to be hosted there. Unmentioned in his column is the fact that Rose Bowl's primary tenant, UCLA, is currently trying to hightail it for the sleek confines of SoFi Stadium. Does Bill really believe that the CFP management committee won’t notice?\n\nOne can add \"lack of class\" to Oregon's ridiculous collection of ugly uniforms based on their performance in the Orange Bowl. Leading 16-0 with less than two minutes in the game while at the Texas Tech two-yard line, the Ducks pushed across an unnecessary touchdown instead of going into the victory formation. Let's hope they get washed out in the semifinals next week.\n\nSorry to see Jerry Neuheisel leave UCLA to join traitor and coaching has-been Chip Kelly at Northwestern. Perhaps young Jerry will skip out after a year — just like his boss does so often.\n\nHaving recently played Detroit, the Rams must have caught a case of \"Dan Campbell-ism\" that is now infecting both the NFL and college games. Definition: Going for it on fourth down while eschewing a 95% likelihood of a made field goal early in the game, all while demonstrating no confidence in your defense. Think those three points would have come in handy at the end of the Rams' loss vs. Atlanta?\n\nThe Rams' consecutive losses recently turned the McVay Rams to the Oy Vay Rams.\n\nThe only positive words for the Lakers that I read in \"Pistons dominate the paint\" by Thuc Nhi Nguyen were, \"The Lakers have eight of their next nine games against teams with losing records.\" That's sad!\n\nThe Lakers coughed the ball up 21 times against the Pistons the other night. I haven't seen that many turnovers since I was at a pastry shop in Solvang.\n\nLuka Doncic is an incredible offensive player. Maybe best in the NBA. But when you’re giving up 20-plus points in layups on the other end, your value drops significantly. “The Trade” was not nearly as lopsided as everyone is saying.\n\nBill Plaschke's New Year's Day column on Los Angeles sports as a saving grace in very difficult times was a home run, touchdown and three-point shot all at one time. Bill had an incredibly difficult 2025, but it was inspirational to read how he was able to get through it with a love of sports getting a huge assist. To carry that theme a bit further, the world can seem so crazy, but following sports can help live and deal with it.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

    "fullText": "This year's Rose Bowl was so uncompetitive that fans paid more attention to the commercials than the actual game.\n\nTo be fair, Indiana squashed Alabama in the quarterfinals of the College Football Playoff. Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza completed 14-of-16 pass attempts for 192 yards with three touchdowns. The Hoosiers also received great performances from Kaleon Black and Roman Hemby. They combined for 188 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 33 carries.\n\nDuring Thursday's blowout at the Rose Bowl, viewers noticed a rather unusual commercial from Eli Lilly and Company. The ad featured a man talking about his weight.\n\n\"I've been dieting since I was 12. You think I need to hear about your workout routine? You don't stop to ask about mine,\" the actor says, via OutKick. \"No matter what I do, you're gonna have your own thoughts, so get it all out while you're in the comment section. I'll be focusing on what really matters, like how I feel when I'm waking up in the morning, like showing up for people I love. My health is my focus, and my body is nobody's business.\"\n\nJudging by some of the responses online, Rose Bowl viewers didn't appreciate this commercial.\n\n\"There are so many things wrong with Lilly, a company that makes billions of dollars from obesity drugs, running a commercial during the Rose Bowl basically promoting the idea that obesity is perfectly healthy,\" Dan Zaksheske of OutKick said.\n\n\"Not Lilly with the [expletive] “my weight is nobody’s business” commercial during the Rose Bowl,\" another person wrote. \"The same company that profits off that? Where the taxpayer subsidizes publicly funded gluttony and medical care?\"\n\n\"Commercial for Lilly pharmaceutical that just aired during halftime in the Rose Bowl is one of the most fascinating cultural artifacts I’ve ever seen, not least because I’m still not certain if the main character was a real person or AI,\" Kat Rosenfield of The Free Press said.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with Lilly, a company that makes billions of dollars from obesity drugs, running a commercial during the Rose Bowl basically promoting the idea that obesity is perfectly healthy. pic.twitter.com/KNrJeeBvzn\n\n— Dan Zaksheske (@RealDanZak) January 1, 2026\n\nEli Lilly and Company is a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Indianapolis. One of their primary products is tirzepatide, which is treatment for type 2 diabetes, weight loss and sleep apnea.\n\n\"Once-weekly Zepbound is a prescription medicine that may help adults with obesity, or some adults with overweight who also have weight-related medical problems to lose excess body weight and keep it off,\" the description for one of their injections states. \"Zepbound may also help improve moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults with obesity. It should be used with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.\"\n\nIf Eli Lilly and Company wanted to stir up a debate during the Rose Bowl, we'd say they accomplished that goal.",

    "fullText": "There are only a few more games before the college football season ends, and one of them will feature the Oregon Ducks. They advanced to the College Football Playoff Semifinals today and will take on a team they’ve already lost to this season, the Indiana Hoosiers.\n\nBoth of these teams won their games in convincing fashion and when they met earlier in the season, the Ducks lost by 10 points in a game that was closer than the final score indicated. Much like the Texas Tech Red Raiders, who Oregon just mopped the floor with, the Ducks and the Hoosiers have a ton of similarities that lead you to believe it will be a tightly-contested game.\n\nThis is reflected in the betting odds for the game, with FanDuel Sportsbook currently setting the spread at plus-3 1/2 for the Ducks, just their second time being an underdog this season. The moneyline odds opened up at plus-158 for Oregon and minus-192 for Indiana, with the point total set at 47 1/2.\n\nOne of the best games we’ve seen this season was the Ducks and the Hoosiers, and now they will meet again in the playoffs as arguably the two best teams in the nation, regardless of seeding. These lines are sure to move between now and next Friday, but for now, bettors are expecting this to be close, low-scoring game.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Oregon Ducks open as slight underdogs vs. Indiana in CFP Semifinals",

    "fullText": "Ole Miss vs. Miami predictions: Expert picks and odds for 2025 CFP semifinal at Fiesta Bowl originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNo. 6 Ole Miss will meet No. 10 Miami in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl on Thursday, Jan. 8.\n\nKickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The game will be televised on ESPN.\n\nOle Miss (13-1) stunned No. 3 Georgia 39-34 in the Allstate Sugar Bowl behind an incredible effort from quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, who led a second-half comeback with 362 passing yards and two TDs. Pete Golding – who replaced Lane Kiffin after the coach left for LSU – has a chance to lead the Rebels to the CFP championship game for the first time in school history.\n\nMiami (12-2) made a program statement with a 24-14 victory against No. 2 Ohio State in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic. Beck averages 120.5 passing yards with two TDs and no interceptions in two playoff games. Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor have led a nasty defense that has allowed 8.5 points through two playoff games. Mario Cristobal has a chance to push the Hurricanes to their first national championship game since 2003 – which was also at the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nMORE: Hurricane Bane is a Category 5 for Miami\n\nHere is an early look at the betting odds and our pick for the winner of the Fiesta Bowl. Odds courtesy of Caesars:\n\nMoneyline: Miami -160, Ole Miss +135\n\nOle Miss is 1-1 ATS as an underdog this season, and both games were against Georgia. The Rebels were 5-1 S/U in games with a spread of seven points or less. The Hurricanes are 2-0 S/U and 2-0 ATS when favored by seven points or less.\n\nMiami's pass rush wrecked the Ohio State game plan in the CFP quarterfinals. Bain has four of the Hurricanes' 12 sacks in the playoff. Mesidor has three sacks in those two games, and they have combined for 26 pressures.\n\nChambliss, however, presents a different challenge with his escapability outside the pocket. That pass rush will have to land, and Chambliss made Georgia pay with receivers Harrison Wallace III and De'Zhaun Stribling. How many risks will Chambliss take against a Miami secondary that features Bryce Fitzgerald (6 INTs), Jakobe Thomas (5 INTs) and Keionte Scott (2 INTs), who had the game-turning pick six against the Buckeyes?\n\nThe other piece is Kewan Lacy, a tough running back who has played through a shoulder injury the last two games. The Rebels are a different challenge for Miami defensive coordinator Corey Hetherman.\n\nMiami will attack Georgia with Mark Fletcher Jr., a tough inside runner who will try to attack the middle with defensive tackles Zxavian Harris and Will Echoles. Sunatrine Perkins and Princewell Umanmielen add to that pass rush. Malachi Toney and CJ Daniels will challenge the Ole Miss secondary in the intermediate passing game.\n\nHow will Beck handle the opportunity to get to the CFP championship game? Beck has thrown just one interception since the 26-20 loss to SMU on Nov. 1, and he has great protection from an offensive line led by Francis Mauigoa.\n\nMiami has not allowed more than 26 points in a game this season – but they have not faced a quarterback like Chambliss either. That is where this matchup will be decided. He passed for 300 or more yards in four of Ole Miss' last five games, and the Rebels are riding the same momentum wave as the Hurricanes. This makes for an almost impossible choice.\n\nSN AWARDS: 2025 All-America team | Player of the Year | Coach of the Year\n\nWhere Texas Tech-Oregon ranks among low-scoring CFP games\n\nYep, Arch Manning leads the 2026 Heisman race\n\nRanking top QBs in transfer portal",

    "fullText": "In a Sugar Bowl classic between two SEC teams fighting for a spot in the College Football Playoff semifinals, one of the biggest winners was in Baton Rouge. Financially, at least.\n\nLane Kiffin, the former Ole Miss coach who left the program last month for LSU, will receive a $500,000 bonus from his new employer thanks to his former team reaching the CFP semifinal via a thrilling 39-34 win over Georgia. The bonus is part of an agreement LSU reached with the coach to lure him from Oxford, offering him the same bonuses he would have received for each CFP victory had he stayed at Ole Miss.\n\nKiffin had already received a $250,000 bonus after the Rebels defeated Tulane in the first round. If they defeat No. 10 Miami in the next round, Kiffin will add another $750,000 to his tally.\n\nAnd if they were to win one more for the program’s first title in decades? One of the most bittersweet $1 million payments in the history of sports.\n\nPete Golding, the defensive coordinator who stayed at Ole Miss to take over as head coach, will receive the same bonuses. On his way out, Kiffin insisted on staying to coach the Rebels in the playoff, but the school understandably didn’t want a coach of another SEC team to be running its program during a key part of recruiting season.\n\nIt was an open question whether Kiffin would show up in New Orleans on Thursday to watch his former players and coaches face Georgia, but he decided to stick with his current school instead. He made an appearance on the court at the LSU women’s basketball team’s game, embracing head coach Kim Mulkey.\n\nNo. 5-ranked LSU took its first loss of the season, falling 80-78 to No. 11 Kentucky. After the game, it appears Kiffin did make it to New Orleans, or at least his family did.\n\nWhat a great finish!!! So much fun!! Only two more to go ⁦@OleMissFB⁩ 🇹🇹 🪄 🏆 #BTA pic.twitter.com/axTTTHP5pO\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) January 2, 2026\n\nMeanwhile, Ole Miss fans were making their thoughts about the man their team was enriching very clear, with a “F*** Lane Kiffin” chant at the end of the game. The state’s governor had a similar outlook.\n\n— Governor Tate Reeves (@tatereeves) January 2, 2026\n\nThis was a situation that was surreal from the moment Kiffin started taking other schools’ calls, and it won’t get any better with Ole Miss have a very real chance at the CFP championship game.",

    "fullText": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Trinidad Chambliss passed for 362 yards and two touchdowns, and Lucas Carneiro kicked his third field goal of the game with 6 seconds left to put No. 6 Mississippi in front for good in a 39-34 victory over third-ranked Georgia in a College Football Playoff in the Sugar Bowl on Thursday night.\n\nIn an unusual twist, the Ole Miss was awarded a safety on its final kickoff when Georgia’s return team tried a cross-field lateral that hit the pylon.\n\nGeorgia then recovered an onside kick and ran one more play in which they executed numerous laterals before the play fizzled, sending Ole Miss (13-1, CFP No. 6 seed) on to a semifinal against Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nKicking off on the heels of two lopsided CFP quarterfinals at the Orange and Rose bowls, the Sugar Bowl provided drama until the end.\n\nAfter seeing a 21-12 halftime lead turn into a 34-24 deficit with 9:02 to play, Georgia (12-2, CFP No. 3 seed) then rallied to tie it, first driving for Gunner Stockton’s 18-yard TD pass to Zachariah Branch before Peyton Woodring’s short field goal tied it with 55 seconds left in regulation.\n\nChambliss responded by setting up the winning kick with a 40-yard pass to De’Zhaun Stribling on third down from Mississippi’s own 30-yard line. A few plays later, Carneiro, who’d already broken Sugar Bowl records with field goals of 55 and 56 yards, hit from 47 and sprinted triumphantly toward the Ole Miss sideline as the Rebels (13-1, CFP No. 6 seed) jubilantly swarmed around him.",

He finished 30-of-46 passes for 362 yards and two touchdown passes.\n\nThe Rebels' five-point win over the Bulldogs served to be the closest game of the CFP quarterfinals, and the closest game of the 2025-26 College Football Playoff. Next up for the Rebels will be No. 10 Miami in the CFP Fiesta Bowl semifinal on Thursday, Jan. 8 at 7:30 p.m. ET at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nGiven the nature of the upset and the fact Kiffin infamously left the Rebels before their CFP berth, social media didn't hold back when it decided to roast the current Tigers coach, who spent the day watching Kim Mulkey and the LSU women's basketball team get upset by Kentucky.\n\nHere's a snippet of those reactions:\n\nHere's a look at social media after Ole Miss' win over Georgia in the CFP Sugar Bowl quarterfinal:\n\nLegendary performance by Ole Miss.

    "fullText": "Twelve has been trimmed to four as the College Football Playoff heads into the national semifinals with No. 1 seed Indiana set to meet No. 5 Oregon in the Peach Bowl and No. 6 Ole Miss matched with No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nThe Hoosiers mauled No. 9 Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl behind another perfect game from Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza, who finished with more touchdown passes, three, than incompletions, two.\n\nThe Rebels dug out of a 21-12 halftime deficit and won 39-34 against No. 3 Georgia, pulling away late with a 47-yard field goal with six seconds left.\n\nOregon smothered No. 4 Texas Tech 23-0 in the Orange Bowl thanks to four turnovers by the Red Raiders, including a key end-zone interception by quarterback Behren Morton in the third quarter.\n\nIn the biggest upset of this year’s tournament, Miami outmuscled No. 2 Ohio State for a 24-14 win in the Cotton Bowl, sending the defending national champions into the offseason on a two-game losing streak.\n\nBefore turning to the next round, here are the biggest winners and losers from the quarterfinals:\n\nThey’re No. 1 in the nation for a reason. But for the doubters and cynics, this destruction of mighty Alabama makes a point that’s impossible to ignore: Indiana’s not just a great story but a potential juggernaut capable of beating the absolute snot out of any team in the tournament. More aggressive than the Tide, more physical, more composed and clearly better prepared, the Hoosiers showed zero rust after a month-long break after the Big Ten championship game. Build a time machine, go back a few years or so, find your younger self and whisper this sentence in your ear: Alabama just lost the Rose Bowl to Indiana by 35 points.\n\nNow 2-0 without Lane Kiffin, the Rebels avenged their one regular-season loss thanks to a brilliant night from senior Trinidad Chambliss, who had 362 yards passing and two touchdowns without an interception. Down 21-12 at halftime, Ole Miss began to take over in the third quarter and then delivered two key scores early in the fourth. Along the way to the game-winning field goal, the Rebels had to deal with several questionable penalty calls (or lack thereof) and needed to regain their composure after Georgia tied the game with a minute to go. That Ole Miss continues to defy the odds really speaks to new coach Pete Golding’s work keeping the team together.\n\nThe image of Oregon as a finesse program persists despite ample evidence to the contrary. The latest example was the Ducks’ shutout in the Orange Bowl, which saw the defense never allow the Red Raiders to come up for air in giving up just 215 yards on 3.5 yards per play. While the running game sputtered and gained just 64 yards, Oregon quarterback Dante Moore hit on 26 of 33 attempts for 234 yards. But the defense did the dirty work in this win, including not just that end-zone pick but a previous strip-sack fumble return earlier in the third quarter that set up the Ducks’ first touchdown.\n\nThe way Miami beat Ohio State matters. Going up against a team many expected to repeat and a defense that ranked first nationally in the major categories, the Hurricanes dictated the tempo and the tone by dominating the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. That was embodied during a five-minute drive late in the fourth quarter that helped Miami bury the Buckeyes. Matchups also matter in the postseason, and Miami might’ve met a friendly opponent in Ohio State’s slower playing style. But there’s no question after the Cotton Bowl that the Hurricanes have the ability to win two more games and the program’s first national championship since 2001.\n\nAlabama hadn’t lost by 30 or more points since 1998. The Crimson Tide were so clearly the inferior team – in talent, coaching, drive, toughness – that the 35-point loss wasn’t surprising, necessarily speaking. But that doesn’t make this any less embarrassing: After fighting back from 17 points down to beat Oklahoma in the opening round, Alabama never even put up a whisper of an argument against the Hoosiers and seemed happy to shut things down early in the second half and look toward next season. This was the program’s seventh loss in two years under coach Kalen DeBoer after dropping nine games across Nick Saban’s final six seasons.\n\nThere’s a question to be asked about how good Ohio State was, really, after losing to Indiana and Miami in its final two games. Yeah, the Buckeyes beat Texas, but that was in the season opener. Their next-best win came against Michigan. The defense was terrific all year but couldn’t get key stops against Miami, especially with the game on the line. The offensive line was great until these past two games, giving up five sacks to both Indiana and Miami after just six in the first 12 games. While plenty of talent is coming back to Columbus, Ohio State has to speed things up offensively after playing too sluggishly this season.\n\nThe Bulldogs seemed on the verge of delivering a knockout blow coming out of the half after a 21-point second quarter. To give back the game at that point underlines Georgia’s unpredictability even during a 12-1 regular season, especially with an offense that was better running the ball than in 2024 but often unable to put teams away. Georgia will be haunted by a great scoring opportunity late in the game, with the Rebels up 34-31: Second-and-goal at the 3-yard line turned into fouth-and-6 and the game-tying field goal instead of the go-ahead score. To not get six points was out of character for a team that came into the Sugar Bowl ranked third in the country with a 79.3% touchdown rate in the red zone.\n\nThe Orange Bowl was a bad look for the Big 12, which joined the ACC in sending just one team into the tournament but had that team ejected right off the bat while Miami has already claimed two playoff wins. The loss also comes after a postseason where Big 12 teams had earned bowl victories against teams from the ACC, SEC and the Big Ten. This still goes down as a banner season for Texas Tech despite the ugly way things ended against Oregon, though it’s clear the Red Raiders will need to reopen the pocketbooks to compile another playoff-worthy roster next season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: College Football Playoff winners, losers from quarterfinals",

    "fullText": "Whoever wins the national championship game on Jan. 19 will be breaking a significant national championship drought.\n\nNo. 10 Miami is the most recent national champion of the four teams remaining in the College Football Playoff. The Hurricanes won their last national title after a 2001 season that was capped by a blowout win in the Rose Bowl.\n\nAfter Miami, the next most-recent national champion is No. 6 Ole Miss. The Rebels claim the 1960 national title after a 10-0-1 season that ended with a 14-6 Sugar Bowl win over Rice.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana and No. 5 Oregon? Neither team has a national title to its name. And one of them is guaranteed to be playing for the first in school history.\n\nHere’s a quick look at the semifinal matchups on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9.\n\nNo. 6 Ole Miss (13-1) vs. No. 10 Miami (12-2)\n\nJan. 8 | 7:30 p.m. ET | ESPN | Miami -3 | Total: 51.5\n\nThe Hurricanes have opened as the early favorites even though Ole Miss avenged a regular-season loss to Georgia in a 37-34 Sugar Bowl win over the Bulldogs.\n\nMiami took down Texas A&M in the first round and Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl on Wednesday night thanks to a relentless pass rush. Can the Hurricanes pressure Trinidad Chambliss the same way? Chambliss’ escapability was on full display against Georgia, especially in the second half. He showed how great of an improvisor he can be after Georgia’s pass rush flushed him from the pocket.\n\nThe Rebels’ win denied Miami QB Carson Beck the opportunity to play his old team for a shot at the national title. But if the betting line is to be believed, a matchup with Ole Miss gives Miami a better shot at making it to the national title game.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana (14-0) vs. No. 5 Oregon (13-1)\n\nJan. 9 | 7:30 p.m. ET | ESPN | Indiana -4 | Total: 46.5\n\nThe Hoosiers are now the clear national title favorites after a 38-3 Rose Bowl romp over Alabama. Indiana is +130 to win the national title ahead of Oregon and Miami at +300 each and Ole Miss at +600.\n\nThe Ducks shut out Texas Tech 23-0 in the Orange Bowl. It was the third shutout in CFP history and the first in nearly 10 years.\n\nIndiana beat Oregon 30-20 in the regular season. Thanks to Ole Miss’ games against Tulane and Georgia in the first two rounds, the first three rounds in this year’s playoff will have had one rematch.\n\nOregon QB Dante Moore threw two interceptions in the Ducks’ October loss as the Hoosiers held Oregon to 267 yards on 64 plays. Oregon’s win over Texas Tech was impressive but it could also have been a lot bigger. The Ducks’ offense squandered a lot of opportunities after getting into Texas Tech territory.",

The Bulldogs’ postseason experience, defensive strength and a regular season win in Athens weighed on many minds.\n\nThat confidence did not survive Thursday night in New Orleans.\n\nOle Miss stunned third-ranked Georgia 39-34 in a chaotic College Football Playoff quarterfinal that featured 30 combined fourth quarter points, multiple lead changes and one of the most unusual endings in bowl history.

Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss carved up the Bulldogs for 362 yards and two touchdowns, repeatedly answering Georgia rallies with poise and precision. His 40-yard strike to De’Zhaun Stribling on third down late in the fourth quarter set up Lucas Carneiro’s decisive 47-yard field goal with six seconds remaining.\n\nCarneiro was flawless all night, drilling three field goals, including Sugar Bowl-record kicks of 55 and 56 yards as Ole Miss totaled 473 yards of offense. Georgia finished with 355 yards but couldn’t come up with the final stop when it mattered.\n\nGeorgia had erased a 10-point deficit in the final minutes, tying the game on Peyton Woodring’s field goal with 55 seconds left. That rally only heightened the drama before Ole Miss delivered the final blow.\n\nIt was the kind of result that shows why the games are played on the field.

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Alabama rallied from a 17-point deficit once in the College Football Playoff, but there would not be a repeat performance against No. 1 Indiana in a quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nThe Crimson Tide tried everything possible to stage a historic comeback on the site of so many memorable moments for the program, from a 1926 win that marked the arrival of southern football as a powerhouse on par with the rest of the country, to a 2024 overtime loss that would be legendary head coach Nick Saban's final game, but not even benching star quarterback Ty Simpson in the second half could provide a spark in a 38-3 loss to the Hoosiers.\n\nThe cracks that had been evident throughout a tumultuous season, from the shock opening loss to Florida State that only got worse as the year went on to why Alabama (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) found itself trailing by three scores against Oklahoma in the first round on Dec. 19, finally brought the inevitable conclusion for a talented, but flawed, team.\n\nWithout the benefit of any semblance of a running game, Simpson struggled to create big plays against Indiana's stout defense, going 12 of 16 for 67 yards and running for 17 yards with a lost fumble. The desperation to keep up with Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza had Alabama going for it on fourth down from its own 34 early in the second quarter, leading to an odd Wildcat pop pass that was stopped short.\n\nAustin Mack, who followed head coach Kalen DeBoer from Washington to Alabama before the 2024 season, took over late in the third quarter and managed a field goal on his first drive. That was as much as the third-year sophomore could muster, ending up 11 of 16 for 103 yards with three sacks.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Just when it looked like teams with a first-round bye might be at a disadvantage in the playoff, the Hoosiers defied the narrative and moved close to a national championship.\n\nCurt Cignetti and his players aren't looking that far ahead, though.

    "fullText": "Biggest College Football Playoff blowouts: Here are the largest margins of victory in CFP history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe nature of the College Football Playoff is to pin the best teams in the country against one another, allowing debates over the best squad to be settled in the race for a national championship.\n\nWith 136 FBS teams, the selection process for the CFP can be controversial, but for the most part, only the elite teams wind up competing in the playoff bracket. Every once in a while though, that doesn't matter much, as a CFP matchup becomes a one-sided affair.\n\nFrom the 2023 national championship game, to some lighter first-round opponents in the first-ever 12-team CFP in 2024, there have been some significant blowouts in the history of college football's postseason.\n\nHere are the 13 biggest blowouts in the history of the College Football Playoff.\n\nMORE: How every Heisman Trophy winner fared in the NFL\n\nThe biggest blowout in CFP history came in a title game, as in 2023, Georgia bludgeoned TCU 65-7 to win the national championship. While the Horned Frogs had made the game by beating Michigan 51-45 in the semifinal, they found no such luck against the Bulldogs.\n\nThe 58-point victory for Georgia wasn't just the most lopsided win in a CFP title game; it marked the biggest win in any title game, and at the time, it was the largest margin of victory in any bowl game at the FBS level.\n\nAs the Bulldogs repeated as the champions and completed a 15-0 season, Stetson Bennett threw for 304 yards and four touchdowns, adding another two scores on the ground. Branson Robinson scored twice on the ground, Kendall Milton had a rushing touchdown, Ladd McConkey caught two touchdowns and Brock Bowers and Adonai Mitchell both caught one pass in the end zone — all while TCU scored just one first-quarter touchdown.\n\nMORE: Revisiting the infamous Uga-Bevo attack video with Texas and Georgia\n\nFinal Score: Oregon 59, Florida State 20\n\nA Pac-12-ACC matchup came in the 2015 Rose Bowl, as second-seeded Oregon took on third-seeded Florida State in Pasadena. Unfortunately for the Seminoles, the CFP semifinal game was all Ducks.\n\nOregon beat the defending national champs 59-20, advancing to the inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship Game. In the game, the Ducks totaled 639 total yards, including 301 rushing, breaking the record for the most points (59) scored in a Rose Bowl.\n\nMarcus Mariota had 338 passing yards, two touchdown passes, one interception and a rushing touchdown in the win, while Thomas Tyner and Royce Freeman added four more scores on the ground. The Ducks went on to fall by 22 points to Ohio State in the championship.\n\nMORE:Complete history of Lee Corso's College GameDay headgear picks\n\nFinal Score: Alabama 38, Michigan State 0\n\nAlabama was an established powerhouse under Nick Saban by 2015, and he continued flexing his coaching muscles in that year's College Football Playoff. Matched up against Michigan State in the semifinal, the Crimson Tide made light work of the Spartans.\n\nWhile most of Alabama's work was done in the second half, including Jake Coker's two touchdown passes to Calvin Ridley. Derrick Henry was his typical dominant self as well, running for 75 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAlabama picked off MSU quarterback Connor Cook twice, controlling the game from start to finish as it advanced to the title game.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 16 greatest Alabama players of all time\n\nFinal Score: LSU 63, Oklahoma 28\n\nThere's a reason the 2019 LSU Tigers are considered one of the best teams in college football history. In their semifinal playoff game, the Tigers exploded for 63 points against the country's fourth-ranked team, Oklahoma.\n\nEven by the end of the first quarter, LSU led 21-7, and by halftime, it was 49-14. The Sooners simply could not contain Joe Burrow and Ed Orgeron's offense; on the day, Burrow had 493 passing yards and an unreal seven touchdown passes, tying the NCAA records for touchdown passes in a half and touchdown passes in a bowl game. Burrow also ran for an eighth touchdown.\n\nJustin Jefferson caught four of Burrow's touchdowns, setting a College Football Playoff record, Terrace Marshall Jr. had two and Thaddeus Moss had another.\n\nMORE: Most NFL Draft picks by a school in one year\n\nFinal Score: Indiana 38, Alabama 3\n\nTo open their 2026 College Football Playoff run, Indiana, one of the all-time worst football programs in college football history, was tasked with one of the best all-time programs: Alabama. History didn't matter very much in the CFP quarterfinal game.\n\nIndiana stampeded through Alabama, 38-3, stymying Kalen DeBoer's offense all day while Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes. The Hoosiers advanced to the semifinal with the victory, becoming the title favorite with defending champion Ohio State's loss.\n\nAlabama totaled just three points all day in the 2026 Rose Bowl for one of the biggest playoff blowouts ever.\n\nMORE: Where Indiana ranks among all-time losing CFB programs\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 31, Ohio State 0\n\nThere's only two shutouts on this list of CFP blowouts, and one came in 2016, when Clemson decimated Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl, which was a playoff semifinal game.\n\nUrban Meyer coached his unit to a 31-0 win, scoring in all four quarters while his defense didn't allow a single point to the Buckeyes. Despite Deshaun Watson's two interceptions, he also ran for two scores and threw for another.\n\nOhio State registered just nine first-downs all night, with quarterback J.T. Barrett throwing a pair of interceptions as Clemson moved onto the championship.\n\nMORE:The 7 biggest national championship upsets ever\n\nFinal Score: Ole Miss 41, Tulane 10\n\nTulane had a hard time keeping up with Ole Miss in the first round of the playoff in 2025, letting up two quick touchdown drives to start the game and only finding the end zone once in a 41-10 loss.\n\nThe Green Wave actually racked up more than 400 yards of offense, but they struggled to finish drives, turned the ball over three times and slipped up again defensively in the second half after a promising finish to the first half.\n\nOle Miss totaled 497 yards of offense in the win, including 346 passing yards with Trinidad Chambliss in full command.\n\nFinal Score: Penn State 38, SMU 10\n\nIn the first year of the 12-team CFP, Penn State earned the right to host a first-round game in Beaver Stadium, and the opposing environment did not go well for the SMU Mustangs. They were blown out, 38-10, as the Nittany Lions moved onto the quarterfinals.\n\nPenn State's first offensive score didn't come until the five-minute mark of the second quarter, but James Franklin's team was already up multiple scored by then — SMU quarterback Kevin Jennings threw two pick-sixes in the first half.\n\nThe Mustangs didn't find the end zone until the fourth quarter, and even on a day where quarterback Drew Allar had just 127 yards and no touchdowns, Penn State rolled to a CFP win.\n\nMORE: How Penn State's 'White Out' became an annual tradition\n\nFinal Score: Alabama 52, Ohio State 24\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide capped a perfect season with a huge win over Ohio State in the 2021 CFP championship, scoring 35 points in the first half alone to coast against the Buckeyes.\n\nAll night, the Crimson Tide offense was on fire — quarterback Mac Jones threw for 464 yards and five touchdown passes, running back Najee Harris scored three times, and Heisman Trophy winning-receiver Devonta Smith took his 12 catches for 215 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe Buckeyes were playing keep-up from the start, and Alabama won yet another national title under Nick Saban.\n\nMORE: Revisiting Alabama's loaded 2015 coaching staff\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 44, Alabama 16\n\nAlabama came into the 2019 title game as the No. 1-ranked team, but the final score said otherwise. The second-ranked Clemson Tigers had no issues en route to a 15-0 record and national title, winning by 28 points.\n\nTrevor Lawrence had a clean 347 passing yards and three touchdown passes, which went to Justyn Ross, Tee Higgins and Travis Etienne, who also scored twice on the ground. Dabo Swinney's squad used 17 second-quarter points to build its advantage.\n\nClemson won its second national title in three years with its blowout win.\n\nMORE: Where is Clemson located?\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 30, Notre Dame 3\n\nIn a CFP semifinal game, Clemson came in and routed Notre Dame in the 2018 Cotton Bowl in Arlington, Texas. The Tigers, who also went on to blow out Alabama in the championship game, walked away with a dominant 30-3 win over the Fighting Irish.\n\nClemson entered with a 13-0 record behind quarterback Trevor Lawrence, and even a suspension for three players, including starting defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence, coming into the game didn't slow the Tigers down.\n\nOf Clemson's 30 points, 27 went unanswered from the first-quarter on. Lawrence threw touchdown passes to Justyn Ross (2) and Tee Higgins, then Travis Etienne put a cap on the win with a 62-yard touchdown run in the third quarter.\n\nMORE: Why are LSU and Clemson both called 'Death Valley'?\n\nFinal Score: Ohio State 42, Tennessee 17\n\nIn hindsight, the fact that Ohio State was the No. 9 seed in the 2024 College Football Playoff bracket looks laughable, but the eventual-champion Buckeyes faced significant questions coming onto the playoff after losing their regular-season finale to Michigan.\n\nHowever, Ryan Day's unit came out and dominated to open the CFP, cruising to a 21-0 start in the first quarter against Josh Huepel's Tennessee squad.\n\nThe Buckeyes advanced to the quarterfinals with a 42-17 win as quarterback Will Howard threw for 311 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, freshman phenom Jeremiah Smith caught two touchdown passes with 103 yards, and running backs TreVeyson Henderson and Quinshon Judkins both scored twice.\n\nMORE: The history of Ohio State coaches' records vs. Michigan\n\nFinal Score: Georgia 34, Michigan 11\n\nAt the 2021 Orange Bowl, Georgia met Michigan for one of the two CFP semifinal games. And on New Year's Eve, it was all Bulldogs.\n\nKirby Smart and Georgia, which would go on to beat Alabama in the title game, took down Jim Harbaugh's Wolverines by 23 points, getting out to a 27-3 lead by halftime and winning 34-11.\n\nStetson Bennett threw for 310 yards and three touchdowns in the win, throwing his scoring passes to Brock Bowers, James Cook and Jermaine Burton.\n\nMORE: Georgia's timeline of trouble under Kirby Smart\n\nHere's a look at the past CFP national title winners.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about College Football Playoff format",

    "fullText": "After a night of rain in Pasadena, the Indiana Hoosiers washed away the weight of history.\n\nEntering the Rose Bowl, College Football Playoff teams coming off first-round byes were winless. At the start of the season, the Hoosiers led college football with the most all-time losses. During their sole previous Rose Bowl appearance in 1968, the Hoosiers lost to USC.\n\nIndiana’s football program spent most of its time stuck in the Big Ten conference basement, but that era is over.\n\nNow, with new blood infused by head coach Curt Cignetti and an offense led by Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza, the Hoosiers have turned the page and shattered expectations.\n\nAfter a quarter of brushing off their rust following a three-week break, No. 1 Indiana rolled to a 38-3 Rose Bowl victory over No. 9 Alabama Thursday afternoon in front of a crowd of 90,278. It is the largest postseason margin of defeat in Crimson Tide history.\n\n\"We've come through in clutch moments,\" Cignetti said during his ESPN postgame interview. \"I'm proud of the way they've responded.\"\n\nIndiana scored its first touchdown on a 21-yard pass from Mendoza to Charlie Becker to make it 10-0. It was the first touchdown scored by a Hoosier at the Rose Bowl in program history, the perfect way to establish Indiana’s domination.\n\nIndiana’s defense established its dominance during a pivotal stretch in the second quarter when Alabama could not afford to let the Hoosiers stretch their lead.\n\nFacing fourth-and-one at the Alabama 34, Indiana coach Curt Cignetti called timeout when it was clear the Tide were in a trick play formation. After the timeout, Alabama tried to get the Indiana defense to jump offsides but couldn’t get a penalty and burned a timeout of its own. The teams lined up one more time on fourth down, with Crimson Tide running back Daniel Hill passing to receiver Germie Bernard. Indiana’s Isaiah Jones and Rolijah Hardy combined to stuff Bernand for no gain and a game-defining turnover on downs.\n\nHoosiers fans celebrated the early success after taking over the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day. The sea of cherry red fans planted their flag and made themselves heard. Any time the word Alabama was mentioned, Indiana fans booed and asserted homefield advantage. With the skies clearing after a morning of heavy rain, Hoosiers joyously broke out “Who’s your daddy?” chants.\n\nCignetti kept taking jabs at the Tide defense with heavy use of the run game early in the contest. When it was his turn to pass, Mendoza was nearly perfect. He finished 14 of 16 passing for 192 yards and three touchdowns. He was sacked three times, but Mendoza never turned the ball over.\n\nMendoza contributed to the strong Indiana run game, frustrating the gashed Tide defense. With all his receivers covered, he scrambled for a back-breaking eight-yard run in the third quarter to tighten Indiana’s control of the game.\n\nThe following play, Mendoza threw a 24-yard touchdown to Elijah Sarrat to make it 24-0. He finished with 38 rushing yards.\n\nEntering the game, Indiana wanted to contain Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson. He gave up a critical first-half fumble and struggled to find seams in the Indiana defense. Tide coach Kalen DeBoer eventually benched Simpson, who had been limited by injuries part of this season, at halftime.\n\nCrimson Tide second-string quarterback Austin Mack finished the game with 103 passing yards. Simpson finished the game with 67. Mack threw a 34-yard pass to Bernard in the third quarter, which led to a 28-yard field goal that made the score 24-3.\n\nThe Hoosiers tacked on a Kaelon Black 25-yard rushing touchdown to make it 31-3. He finished the game with 99 yards and one touchdown.\n\nAs clouds dissipated, the Hoosiers booked their ticket to the Peach Bowl, where they will face Oregon in their pursuit of the ultimate team award – the national championship.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

(AP) — No. 1 Indiana became the first team in the brief history of the 12-team College Football Playoff to win a game after receiving a first-round bye, smothering Alabama 38-3 in a quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nThe Hoosiers (14-0; No. 1 AP, No. 1 CFP) ended a six-game losing streak for teams coming off an extended layoff, including second seed Ohio State falling to Miami in the Cotton Bowl on Wednesday and fourth seed Texas Tech being shutout by Oregon in the Orange Bowl earlier on Thursday.\n\nAn inauspicious start made it seem as if Indiana might continue the trend of teams unable to respond after a long layoff, going three-and-out on the opening possession with Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza taking two sacks. The Crimson Tide (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) then found early success with two quick first downs into Hoosiers’ territory before the defense stepped up to force a punt.\n\nFrom there, Indiana came to life, taking a 17-0 halftime lead on a 31-yard field goal by Nicolas Radicic and two touchdown passes from Mendoza. Avoiding an early deficit was crucial, as it had been something of a constant in the previous losses by idle teams.\n\nThe Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-0 hole at the break against the Hurricanes, and the Red Raiders allowed 104 yards to the Ducks while gaining minus-2 yards in the first quarter. In last year's Granddaddy of Them All, Oregon gave up the first 34 points in a 41-21 loss to eventual national champion Ohio State.\n\nNot spotting Alabama an early advantage allowed Indiana to continue playing to its strengths and eventually wear down the SEC at-large participant.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes, Indiana’s defense thoroughly throttled Alabama, and the top-seeded Hoosiers roared into the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 38-3 victory in the 112th Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nMendoza passed for 192 yards in his first game since winning his school’s first Heisman Trophy, but the hard-nosed Hoosiers (14-0, No. 1 CFP seed) won the Rose Bowl for the first time in school history by dominating the Crimson Tide (11-4, No. 9 CFP seed) at the line of scrimmage.\n\nIndiana scored the game’s first 24 points before pouring it on with fourth-quarter rushing TDs from Kaelon Black and Roman Hemby, wrapping up a jubilant win in the 112th edition of the Granddaddy of Them All.\n\nCharlie Becker, Omar Cooper Jr. and Elijah Sarratt caught TD passes, while Black rushed for 99 yards. Indiana outgained Alabama 407-193, steadily delighting a decidedly pro-Indiana crowd that celebrated its long-struggling team’s first Rose Bowl game appearance since 1968 with chants of “Hoosier Daddy?” in the final minutes.\n\nIndiana had not won any bowl game since the Copper Bowl in 1991, but history has been no match for Curt Cignetti and his dominant Hoosiers during the coach’s two transcendent seasons.\n\nThe Hoosiers are headed to the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9 for a CFP semifinal rematch with fifth-seeded Oregon, which routed Texas Tech 23-0 earlier Thursday in the Orange Bowl. Indiana beat the then-No. 3 Ducks 30-20 in Eugene last October in one of Cignetti’s most impressive Big Ten victories.\n\nIndiana is two wins away from the first national championship in school history after becoming the first team to advance following a first-round bye in the current 12-team playoff format. The first six bye teams — including the first two this season — couldn’t come back strong from an extra-long layoff, but the Hoosiers took care of business while improving to 25-2 under Cignetti.\n\nThe Crimson Tide’s second season under Kalen DeBoer ended in the same venue as their final season under Nick Saban two years ago. Alabama was outclassed one week after an impressive road win over Oklahoma, managing just 151 yards before the meaningless final minutes of this blowout.\n\nTy Simpson passed for 67 yards before backup Austin Mack replaced him in the third quarter. Mack immediately got the Tide rolling on a 65-yard drive leading to a short field goal, but the Hoosiers responded with two unstoppable TD drives.\n\nIndiana dominated the famous Rose Bowl turf, which stayed pristine despite nearly 24 hours of steady rain before kickoff. The storms dissipated while the Hoosiers took their first-half lead, and blue skies appeared in the second half.\n\nAfter the first scoreless first quarter in a Rose Bowl in 26 years, Indiana’s second drive stretched 84 yards and 16 plays over nearly nine minutes before Nicolas Radicic’s 31-yard field goal on the first snap of the second quarter.\n\nIndiana’s defense then stopped Alabama on fourth and 1 at the Tide 34, and Mendoza fired a long, high pass to the leaping Becker four plays later for a 21-yard touchdown.\n\nSimpson fumbled in Indiana territory after a courageous first-down scramble late in the first half, and the Hoosiers methodically drove for Mendoza’s 1-yard TD pass with 17 seconds left to Cooper, the hero of Indiana’s dramatic victory over Penn State.\n\nAfter halftime, Mendoza led a steady 79-yard drive ending in his 24-yard TD pass to the leaping Sarratt.\n\nThe victory is the latest step in the monumental two-season turnaround of what was the losingest program in college football when Cignetti took charge. After winning 11 games and reaching the CFP last season, the Hoosiers steamrolled through their schedule this fall before beating defending national champion Ohio State for the Big Ten title and ascending to the No. 1 spot in the AP Top 25 for the first time.\n\nAlabama: It was remarkable to see the most successful program of the 21st century get dominated up front. The Tide’s inability to run the ball was a season-long problem, but it was particularly painful in Pasadena. Whether through personnel or scheme, DeBoer’s offense must take a step forward next year to reach the standard expected at Bama.\n\nIndiana: The Hoosiers acted like they’ve been here before, even though they haven’t. Cignetti’s group has a businesslike demeanor that wasn’t remotely altered by Alabama’s reputation and history.\n\nAlabama: Host East Carolina on Sept. 5.\n\nIndiana: A trip to Atlanta to face the powerhouse Ducks, who lost last season’s Rose Bowl to Ohio State as the No. 1 seed.",

    "fullText": "The New Year’s Day College Football Playoff tripleheader wraps up with the Mississippi Rebels facing the Georgia Bulldogs in the Sugar Bowl.\n\nThis matchup is a rematch of a regular-season instant classic, one Georgia won behind a stunning fourth-quarter comeback. Ole Miss hasn’t lost since, however, and even without Lane Kiffin on the sideline, the Rebels rolled Tulane in the opening round.\n\nWill Kiffin’s absence finally show in tonight's CFP quarterfinal?\n\nMy Mississippi vs. Georgia predictions and college football picks break down the matchup and deliver the best bets for the Sugar Bowl on Thursday, January 1.\n\nThis will be a close game, but Georgia will come out on top. Kirby Smart and the Dawgs’ big-game experience will be the difference at the end of the day.\n\nWell, that and that relentless Georgia rushing attack.\n\nThe Mississippi Rebels passed their first test without Lane Kiffin with flying colors, absolutely crushing the Tulane Green Wave 41-10 in the first round of the College Football Playoff. But their first real challenge comes in the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day against their SEC rivals, the Georgia Bulldogs.\n\nThe Bulldogs were the last team to defeat the Rebels, winning an epic comeback 43-35 on October 18, in a game that saw Georgia outscore Mississippi 17-0 in the fourth quarter.\n\nNow, Georgia has won nine in a row, which includes avenging its lone loss of the season by defeating rival Alabama in the SEC Championship Game in dominant fashion.\n\nBut while the Bulldogs are rolling, it doesn’t mean they aren’t vulnerable. This isn’t the Georgia team of years past, which had historically good defenses. The Dawgs are good, just not great. And good passing teams have been a problem.\n\nGeorgia ranks 55th in defensive success rate on dropbacks and 63rd in opponent points per quality drive. And led by QB Trinidad Chambliss, the Rebels are a quality offense.\n\nChambliss didn’t begin the season as Mississippi’s starter, but he’s left no doubt about who’s the man since taking over. The Rebels rank ninth in EPA per play and 15th in offensive success rate and are seventh in both EPA and success rate on dropbacks.\n\nBut what makes this Mississippi offense more of a problem for Georgia than, say, Alabama, is its balance.\n\nWith star running back Kewan Lacy complementing Chambliss, the Rebels can be hard for anyone to slow down, especially with offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. staying with the team.\n\nGeorgia's still a very good team and has the edge in big-game coaching and experience. And while that could be the difference in who wins the Sugar Bowl,  Mississippi will make the Bulldogs work for it and keep this game close.\n\nWith Chambliss being the key to the outcome of the Sugar Bowl, it only makes sense that he is the focus of this SGP.\n\nIn 11 games as the starter, Chambliss threw for 3,239 yards with 18 touchdowns and just three interceptions. He also added 485 yards and another eight scores on the ground. In the last meeting against Georgia, he threw for 263 yards and two TDs, rushed for 42 yards, and scored two more TDs.\n\nHis dynamic ability is a problem for anyone to stop. So, let’s go Over 247.5 passing yards, which he has done in 10 of his 11 starts, and add him to score an anytime touchdown.\n\nTrinidad Chambliss Over 247.5 passing yards\n\nTrinidad Chambliss anytime touchdown\n\nTo make this a deep ball SGP, let's take Chambliss from finding the end zone not just once, but multiple times in the Sugar Bowl.\n\nTrinidad Chambliss Over 247.5 passing yards\n\nSpread: Mississippi +6.5 | Georgia -6.5\n\nMoneyline: Mississippi +190 | Georgia -230\n\nOver/Under: Over 55.5 | Under 55.5\n\nMississippi has covered the Spread in nine of its last 13 games for +4.60 Units and a 32% ROI.
