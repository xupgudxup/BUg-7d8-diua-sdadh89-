    "fullText": "Whether you like it or not, NCAA Division III women’s wrestling programs will host their own championship during the 2027-28 season.\n\nThe reason? Competitive balance.\n\nIt should shock no one that this was the inevitable direction for women’s college wrestling. Division III schools do not offer athletic scholarships, so a separate end-of-year tournament makes sense.\n\nD3 Hobart College in Geneva, New York, doesn’t face Power Four Alabama for the NCAA men’s football championship. Why would D3 Eureka College in Eureka, Illinois, face Power Four Iowa for the NCAA women’s wrestling title?\n\n“Any time an athletic director adds a sport, the first question they will ask is if we can be reasonably competitive to justify it,” NCWA executive director Mike Moyer said. “No athletic director wants to add a sport where they can’t provide a quality experience. It doesn’t mean they have to win a national title. They just want to know if we can reasonably provide a good experience.”\n\nThis is what competitive sports do.\n\nDouble A teams play Double A teams in baseball.\n\nG League teams play G League teams in basketball.\n\nD3 schools face other D3 schools in wrestling.\n\n“The split was a long time coming, and in the grand scheme of women’s wrestling, it allows us to continue to grow at a high rate,” Eastern coach Andrew Taylor said. “With Division III passing the vote to split off for our own championships, Division II and Division I can use the momentum to continue their growth as well.\n\n\"The split was a long time coming.\" - Eastern coach Andrew Taylor\n\n“For our program at Eastern, it really only changes how we approach things for two weekends out of the year. We will still be recruiting athletes who want to chase World Teams, and we will still be creating a schedule that allows us to compete against some of the best programs in the country in all divisions.\n\n“I am excited for what the leadership committee can do to create an incredible event, and our goal will be to chase a team trophy in that first year.”\n\nFor the next two years, all three divisions will compete at the NCAA Women’s Wrestling Championships in March. This offers a unique historical opportunity for Division III programs to win championships and become All-Americans against their D1 and D2 counterparts.\n\nNorth Central — a Division III program in Naperville, Illinois — is the outlier. The Cardinals won the 2023 National Collegiate Women’s Wrestling Championships (without Iowa), then finished second to the Hawkeyes in 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe Joe Norton-led squad won the 2026 NWCA National Duals on January 9-10, handing Iowa its first dual loss in program history with a 23-21 semifinal win. North Central defeated McKendree in the finals, 21-18, for its first National Duals title after finishing second for three straight years.\n\nNews of the D3 split was announced on January 16, leading some to speculate that North Central’s recent National Duals success against D1 and D2 teams played a factor.\n\nThe driving force was the announcement that the NCAA Championships would feature 18-woman brackets at each of the 10 weights. Had it been 21 or 24 qualifiers per weight, a split may have been delayed.\n\nNCAA women's programs by division\n\nNorth Central’s four-season run is staggering. The Cardinals are 55-5 in duals, and have placed 145, 160, and 110.5 points ahead of the next closest Division III team at the national championships.\n\n“I hate (the split),” Norton said. “Selfishly, I hate it.”\n\n“If you asked our women if they want to go and have the experience they had last year, they would take it. We lost by 19.5 points, but we were winning going into day two. To have that experience and to go toe-to-toe with the Hawkeyes and fall short and lose, or win by 145 points? Our girls would choose losing. Our girls would take the experience they had over winning by 145 points (at the Division III NCAA Championships).\n\n\"Selfishly, I hate the split.\" - North Central coach Joe Norton\n\n“I’m answering questions right now from recruits that don’t want to come here because we are going to be D3. Over time, we aren’t going to have that level of athlete, regardless of how good our coaching staff is. It’s not like we go D3 and we’re not as good of coaches. We’re the same coaching staff, but we’re not going to coach the same high-level athletes.”\n\nNorton won’t go down without a fight. He’s exploring a multidivisional classification that allows a Division III program to compete at the highest level. That’s why the Franklin & Marshall (D3) and Lock Haven (D2) men’s wrestling teams compete at the NCAA D1 Championships.\n\nThe multidivisional rule no longer exists, but Norton will petition. Moving from D3 to D1 is a 12-year process for an athletic program, so that’s off the table. He will use St. Thomas University to bolster his case. The NCAA granted the Tommies permission to move directly from D3 to D1 in 2021.\n\nCould the North Central women’s wrestling team do the same?\n\nHere’s where it gets tricky. Athletic directors want to win championships. Is it better to win a D3 team championship just like every other program at North Central is striving to do, or go toe-to-toe against Iowa, McKendree, and Grand Valley State to possibly finish second or fourth, or 10th?\n\nOr, with the right tournament and the right recruits, maybe you win one at the highest level.\n\n\"You can’t win the lotto if you don’t buy a lotto ticket.” - Joe Norton\n\n“We’re not asking for scholarships; we just want to compete in the national collegiate tournament, which is Division I and II for women’s wrestling. That’s still my optimistic hope. That’s what we want to do. Our athletic director has to agree, and our president has to agree. We can’t do anything if our president doesn’t agree to do it. And the NCAA would have to approve a petition.\n\n“The odds are, in 2028, we are going to be Division III, but we are going to take this shot in the dark and see what happens. I’ve also told every girl, if you come here and we split off, and we don’t get to petition up, I’ll make the right calls to get you to the right place. I’m not going to handcuff you and make you stay here. If that’s your dream and you want to go do that, then we’ll do it. We’ll find the right program for you. I just told a recruit that yesterday.\n\n“No one thought we were going to beat Iowa. We’re going to try. You can’t win the lotto if you don’t buy a lotto ticket.”\n\nFor now, D1 and D2 programs will host their own NCAA Championship when the D3 split happens, leaving more questions than answers.\n\nWill D2 programs split like D3, leaving eight D1 programs on an island? Division II has the minimum number of programs to make the request, so they may move forward with it.\n\n“I don’t know the answer to that, but I don’t know why they couldn’t,” Moyer said. “I’ve never been told they couldn’t, but I’ve never been told for certain if they can’t.\n\n“No matter what, we need to add a lot more D1 and D2 programs, and that’s exactly what the NWCA is working on.”\n\nAlso, how many national qualifiers will each division have? Under the current format, there are 18. It seems likely that the number will decrease when the split happens in 2028.\n\nWill it be 4 qualifiers? 8? 12? 16?\n\n“No matter what, we need to add a lot more D1 and D2 programs, and that’s exactly what the NWCA is working on.” - NWCA executive director Mike Moyer\n\nColorado Mesa coach Travis Mercado likes a challenge, including battles with the Hawkeyes, but he also likes the idea of winning a championship against comparable programs. As it stands today, the Mavericks will continue to face D1 teams like Iowa, Lehigh, Presbyterian, Lindenwood, Sacred Heart, and Delaware State.\n\n“Is it the right time (for D2 to split)? I don’t know,” Mercado said. “Competitive Travis Mercado and Colorado Mesa says, yes, we want to be able to compete amongst our peers and have an equitable opportunity to compete for a national championship against a similar school like Grand Valley State, McKendree, King, Quincy, and Fort Hays. Right now, you have one juggernaut in the University of Iowa.”\n\n“I think as Division I teams add and Division II teams add, then we can start to have this conversation of splitting off. I hope we’re at a point with women’s collegiate wrestling that we’re able to split off, we’ll have D1, D2, D3, NAIA, and junior college. I’m excited about that opportunity down the road. It might take two years. It might take five or 10.”\n\nEither way, the landscape of women’s college wrestling is changing — fast.\n\nKasey Kruczek, Wilkes\n“For me, I like seeing all the divisions wrestling together, but I also know how great it is to split off for those athletes with their training schedules. I think it comes down to preseason and postseason training schedules. Athletes can work out all year on their own, but I don’t get as much of the preseason with them as the other divisions. I get eight flex practices that I can coach with them, and our strength and conditioning coaches can work out with them, but I can’t be in there if it’s not on flex days.”\n\nTyler Keane, Western New England\n\"I love a D3 split. I think it allows Division III athletes to compete for a national title and All-American. Not that we don’t get to now, but this kind of evens the playing field. We have a bunch of athletes who are hungry for this split, and we can’t wait to compete. Right now, we’re focused and excited for the regional tournament and national tournament this year. When that D3 split happens, I think it gives a fair, competitive advantage for Division III athletes.\n\n\"I find it’s uneven when it comes to training. In terms of training and practices, and being able to be with your athletes during certain times of the year. Division I has more opportunities, and the big thing with D1 and D2 is athletic scholarships, which makes it difficult for D3, at least on my end, for recruiting.\"\n\nJoe Jamison, Ursinus\n\"I think in the long run, for the growth of the sport and for the sustainability of Division III, I think it’s important. Selfishly, I hate it right now. As a women’s wrestling coach at a Division III school, it’s been a lot of fun to compete at the highest level possible. Right now, we have a ton of talent on our team, and we’re excited to continue to pursue our goals and try to get girls on the podium and win national titles at the highest level. At the same time, for the longevity of the sport, I know the split is important as it is going to level the playing field for the schools that don’t have the same resources as Division I and Division II schools.\n\n\"It’s twofold. There’s the financial piece where it comes down to budgets, resources available, and scholarships. As a Division III school, for the most part, our budgets are going to be smaller than those of Division I and Division II schools. It’s just the nature of how it works. They can offer athletic scholarships where we can’t.\n\n\"The other piece is the rules piece. Division I and Division II institutions can mandate athletic hours the minute they step on campus. They can mandate off-season hours where they are either in the room or in the weight room. For us, in Division III, we’re not allowed to do that. Coaches are not allowed to be around their athletes in an athletic setting at all until official practice starts. Division I and II schools start practicing eight hours a week, where we can’t do anything that’s mandated or even be with them until October.\n\n\"A lot of Division III schools have found a way around that with RTCs. If you have one, you can do certain things. You can’t mandate it, but it is available.\"",

    "fullText": "With March Madness inching closer, Jay Bilas is ready to give his take on how the college basketball landscape looks with just three weeks of regular-season play left.\n\nBilas just released his ranking of the top 68 college basketball teams at ESPN, and the Kentucky Wildcats came in at No. 28. Just like the latest top-25 polls, Bilas isn’t ready to call these Wildcats a top-25 team just yet.\n\nHere’s what he had to say about Kentucky.\n\n“The early returns on this Kentucky team were not promising,” Bilas wrote. “The Wildcats opened the season 5-4 with lopsided losses to Michigan State and Gonzaga. And it hasn’t been all clear skies since — they scored only 55 points in a 25-point road loss at Vanderbilt on Jan. 27 — but they have righted the ship with a 12-4 response to their sputtering start. One clear difference has been the play of Otega Oweh. He averaged 13.7 points through those first nine games, but 18.8 in the 16 since. They’ll need him to maintain that with Kam Williams and Jayden Quaintance still out.”\n\nThe Wildcats actually have four wins over teams ranked ahead of them: No. 20 Arkansas, No. 19 St. John’s, and No. 16 Tennessee (twice). Kentucky also has wins over No. 31 Texas, No. 34 Indiana, and No. 61 LSU.\n\nAll eight of Kentucky’s losses are to teams in this ranking, the lowest being Missouri at No. 49. The other seven losses are against teams in the top 23 of this ranking.\n\nFlorida, who Kentucky just lost on the road to and hosts in the regular-season finale, checks in at No. 7.\n\nSo, do you like this spot for the Cats?

    "fullText": "The Georgia Bulldogs are in a free fall, losing five of their last six. That’s not how you want to embark on a trip to Rupp Arena to face the Kentucky Wildcats.\n\nI break down why Collin Chandler will add to their misery in my Georgia vs. Kentucky predictions and college basketball picks for Tuesday, February 17.\n\nGeorgia vs Kentucky best bet: Collin Chandler Over 2.5 threes made (+135)\n\nCollin Chandler is a big reason why the Kentucky Wildcats lead the SEC in three-point accuracy since the start of conference play. He’s shooting 46.4% from downtown through 12 conference games.\n\nAnd over his past four games, he’s stepped up big for the Wildcats. He’s connected on 14 of 25 efforts from beyond the arc, making at least three treys in each of his last three outings.\n\nThe Georgia Bulldogs are allowing SEC opponents to shoot 34.2% from deep, and allow the most offensive rebounds in the league.\n\nLook for Chandler to capitalize on open looks and extended possessions.\n\nGeorgia’s seven defeats in SEC play have each featured its opponents scoring at least 86 points. That’s what happens when you rank 339th nationally in defensive rebound rate and allow teams to shoot 54.5% from inside the arc.\n\nIf you give the Wildcats open looks off second-chance points, they’ll make you pay. Kentucky will hit the team total Over for the fifth straight game.\n\nCollin Chandler Over 2.5 threes made\n\nMalachi Moreno has improved week after week for this Kentucky team, and should have a strong game against this struggling Georgia frontcourt.\n\nHe’s posting a 12.5% offensive rebound rate in SEC play, and is coming off an 11-point, 11-rebound performance against the Gators.\n\nMoreno’s scored in double-figures in three of his last four games, and will flirt with another double-double against the Bulldogs.\n\nCollin Chandler Over 2.5 threes made\n\nMalachi Moreno Over 7.5 rebounds\n\nSpread: Georgia +7 (-110) | Kentucky -7 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Georgia +240 | Kentucky -300\n\nOver/Under: Over 161.5 (-110) | Under 161.5 (-110)\n\nKentucky has hit the Team Total Over in their last 4 games (+4.00 Units / 87% ROI).

    "description": "College basketball analyst Seth Greenberg went off on the Kansas State Wildcats for how they handled the firing of head coach Jerome Tang.",
    "fullText": "Seth Greenberg takes shot at Kansas State Wildcats after Jerome Tang firing appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Kansas State Wildcats’ decision to fire basketball head coach Jerome Tang is garnering serious criticism from the likes of Seth Greenberg.\n\nKansas State made the decision to fire Tang after four seasons, having hired him in 2022. The athletics department stated they had cause to fire the head coach midseason, per ESPN’s college sports insider Pete Thamel.\n\n“Kansas State is firing Jerome Tang for cause. They’ve informed him of this formally tonight. The basis for the for cause firing is language in his contract that references any activity that brings “public disrepute, embarrassment, ridicule” to Kansas State,” Thamel wrote.\n\nGreenberg made a Feb. 17 appearance on ESPN’s SportsCenter. He called out the Wildcats’ reasoning for letting go of Tang, citing it was the lack of wins that led to the firing, not for his actual conduct and behavior.\n\n“The university said his behavior was embarrassing. To me, the university’s behavior is embarrassing. The athletic director’s behavior is embarrassing,” Greenberg said.\n\n“Jerome Tang, he made mistakes. He made mistakes in his roster construction. He made mistakes in terms of how maybe he handled this team. But one thing he didn’t do, he didn’t deserve to be fired with cause; he’s getting fired because he did not win enough games.”\n\nSeth Greenberg on Kansas State firing Jerome Tang for cause: “The university said his behavior was embarrassing. To me, the university’s behavior is embarrassing. The athletic director’s behavior is embarrassing… He didn’t deserve to be fired with cause…” pic.twitter.com/6FQvP3UVfI\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) February 16, 2026\n\nSeth Greenberg is right to question Kansas State’s approach to its decision. Regardless, Jerome Tang will be looking for a new team next season.\n\nMaking the Elite Eight of the 2023 NCAA Tournament and the NIT the following year, Tang suffered back-to-back losing campaigns since. Throughout his four years with the Wildcats, he finished with a 71-57 overall record. This includes a 29-39 display throughout the team’s matchups in conference play.\n\nKansas State has a 10-15 overall record on the season, going 1-11 in its Big 12 matchups so far. They are close to the bottom of the Big 12 standings, having a tiebreaker advantage over the Utah Utes while trailing the Baylor Bears and the Colorado Buffaloes.\n\nGoing through six consecutive losses, the Wildcats will hope to return to the win column in their next matchup. They host the Bears as tip-off will take place on Feb. 17 at 9 p.m. ET.",

    "title": "After 3 years of forcing myself to love venture capital, I quit and became a silent disco DJ in Bali",
    "description": "Even though he realized right away, it took TK three years to quit what he thought was his dream career since college.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nic Huzz, 28, who quit a Sydney-based venture capital job to run a silent disco business in Bali, Indonesia. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was never one of those kids who knew what they wanted to be when they grew up.\n\nWhen I was six, we were asked to draw a picture of our future job. I stared at a blank page until I remembered a weekend trip to the mall with my mom, where I'd wandered into a game store and decided the owner must get to play with the toys all day. So I just drew that.\n\nThat uncertainty followed me even when I was 18. When it came time for university, I did what everyone told me to do: choose something broad, keep my options open. I studied communications and entrepreneurship, took on unpaid internships, and worked my way into the startup world. Eventually, I got a full time role at what I thought was my dream job: working at a venture capital firm in Sydney.\n\nOn paper, it was perfect. I was helping founders build companies. I had a title people respected.\n\nBut within a month of starting full time, I realized I wasn't happy. The job wasn't bad, and that was part of the problem. I'd spent years chasing it, and when I finally arrived, I felt empty. I began to understand that what I actually wanted wasn't the job itself, but the validation I thought came with it.\n\nMost days, I sat behind a desk from 9 to 5. The parts I loved — facilitating programs, traveling, working with founders — made up a small fraction of my week. I realized I had too much energy to sit still in an office for that long.\n\nThen, in 2020, lockdowns hit, and the job became even more soul-crushing because I didn't have the weekends to escape it all. Even though I figured out that I wasn't happy nearly right away, it took me more than three years to quit.\n\nI tried everything. For the first two years, I went on this massive journey where I learned how I could start designing a life that feels true for me. I spent around 42,000 Australian dollars, or $30,000, on more than 50 self-help coaches, programs, online learning courses, and books. You name it, I did it. I had all the mental models and frameworks in the world, but little about my reality changed.\n\nI began to realize that you don't rise to the level of your ambitions — you fall to the level of what feels safe. I was stuck because of fear: fear of judgment, failure, and not being good enough.\n\nIn the months before I quit, I challenged myself to do one thing every week that genuinely terrified me. At first, it was small — posting a vulnerable video online, dancing on my Instagram story, performing magic tricks for strangers in restaurants. Then it escalated to stand-up comedy and singing in public, with no background in either. Within five weeks of that challenge, I'd moved to Bali to work remotely for the firm.\n\nAbout three months after working from Bali in 2023, I got a text from my boss saying we were opening a new office in Sydney and that it was time for me to come back. I remember my body physically froze, and I told her I could not do it.\n\nShe told me she saw it coming and was actually proud of me for finally saying it and wanting to move on to do different things.\n\nI didn't have an alternate plan for months and was living off my savings. I went from earning 85,000 Australian dollars a year to earning nothing. For months, I lived on a few hundred dollars a week. Twice, my bank account dropped close to zero.\n\nAs part of my challenge, I had started bringing a couple of silent disco headphones to the beaches in Bali and Thailand and was asking strangers to join me as I danced. More and more people kept joining each time I did it, and a friend suggested I start taking donations. My imposter syndrome crept in, and I told them that I was just doing it for fun. I was so conditioned to associate work with suffering that it felt unfair to make money while having fun.\n\nI finally listened to my friends about the donations. At the fourth or fifth disco, I remember making more money in an hour than I did in a day at my corporate job. I started running silent disco sessions and was even asked if I could rent out my headsets to others.\n\nAt one point, a club owner asked if I could provide them with 300 headsets, and I had to go to the best bank in the world — the bank of mom and dad — for a loan to buy 250 more headsets. The loan was worth more than I had earned in the past 12 months, but it helped me eventually support major conferences in Bali, such as AWS, Amazon, and IBM.\n\nLast year, I made around 30,000 Australian dollars, which is a lot less than I made in Sydney. But I wake up excited every day and get to choose where I live and how I work.\n\nMy nervous system went through hell getting here, and I don't believe anyone should quit their job overnight. But I do think most of us stay stuck because we think safety comes from a salary. I've learned that it comes from trusting myself.",

    "fullText": "Lady Vols basketball moved up a spot in the Associated Press poll after going 1-1 in SEC play last week.\n\nTennessee (16-7, 8-3 SEC) was ranked No. 21 in the AP Top 25 on Feb. 16 after a 45-point win over Missouri and a 65-63 loss to No. 4 Texas. The Lady Vols were ranked No. 22 in both the AP poll and USA TODAY coaches poll last week.\n\nTennessee is back in action right away with a road matchup against No. 16 Ole Miss (20-6, 7-4) on Feb. 17 (7 p.m. ET, ESPNU). The game was originally scheduled for Jan. 26 before icy conditions in Oxford, Mississippi, postponed the matchup.\n\nThe Lady Vols will also face Texas A&M at home on Feb. 19 before playing No. 10 Oklahoma on the road Feb. 22.\n\nTennessee started the season as a consensus top-10 team, ranked No. 9 in the coaches preseason poll and No. 8 in the AP preseason poll. It fell out of the top 10 after losing the season opener to NC State and dropped to No. 12 in both polls after starting 2-1.\n\nUT had its biggest drop in the polls after its losses to UCLA, Louisville and South Carolina. It fell six spots in the coaches poll and five spots in the AP poll after losing to the Bruins, and it fell six spots in the AP Top 25 after losing to Louisville. The Lady Vols fell five spots in the USA TODAY coaches poll after the loss to the Gamecocks.\n\nTennessee ended the 2024-25 season ranked No. 16 in the coaches poll and No. 15 in the AP poll after starting Kim Caldwell's first season at the helm unranked. UT was ranked as high as No. 11 last season, though it never cracked the top 10.\n\nThe Lady Vols have been ranked in the AP Top 25 the most of any program since the poll began in 1976.

    "description": "I never pictured myself working full time in the family business, but after college, I joined my mom's company. Sometimes we clash.",
    "fullText": "Working with my family full time was not something I had pictured for myself growing up. Even when I was given a chance to sit down and learn the family business full time, I told myself it would only be temporary.\n\nI had plenty of peers who planned from the get-go to take over their parents' companies, but not me. Still, my mother was determined to have me learn the ins and outs, no matter what I may end up doing in the future.\n\nNow that I've been a full-time employee for seven years, I've learned the intricacies of our family business. It isn't easy, but working with my family has made me appreciate everything I grew up with and the professional skills I've gained.\n\nMy mom started the companies I now work for in her early 30s. Starting out as a real estate agent, she learned that many of the properties she listed had underground or basement heating oil tanks that needed to be removed and replaced. Instead of coordinating multiple contractors, she started her first company to become a one-stop shop for the entire project. As many of her clients now had new oil tanks, she also started a company to provide oil and service for their heating equipment. The one-stop shop got a bit bigger with the newest addition.\n\nSince my mother has been an entrepreneur her entire life, it's all my sister and I have ever known. There are many pictures of our mom on job sites while pregnant or with us in strollers, watching the excavators and trailers go by.\n\nMany of the people who worked in the office felt like family, as I grew up stopping in with my mom and dad after school so they could wrap up their days.\n\nAt home, at work, or anywhere we may go, Mom is the boss. I didn't even know that HVAC and construction were male-dominated fields until my teens because every colleague she had did exactly what she said with little to no questioning.\n\nAs a kid, I would help clean the offices on the weekends. When I was in college, I worked in the office during my summer break. I got to learn just how the daily operations I'd heard about and seen my entire life.\n\nI started answering phones, sending out marketing mailers, and gradually taking on more of the responsibilities my older sister had handled years earlier.\n\nAfter college, I started working full-time at my mother's company as an office assistant. Now, I'm a coordinator for job sales, contract writing, bookkeeping, scheduling, and an ongoing list of administrative tasks that keep the businesses running.\n\nAlthough I never pictured myself working here full time, I try to look on the bright side. I left college not wanting to pursue the degree I ended up with, but I'm still able to support myself and my loved ones while I determine the new path I want to take.\n\nPeople often ask me if I enjoy working with my immediate family every day. I'd be lying if I said it didn't have its benefits, like the job security and ease of taking time for family matters.\n\nBut it also, of course, comes with an array of challenges.\n\nHaving my older sister directly over me as the office manager means that when things get frustrating, she easily treats me like the baby brother. Stern though she may be, she's always got the right answer and is sure I don't make the same mistakes twice. Like our mother, she commands a room's attention and reminds everyone exactly who's in charge at that moment.\n\nSure, it is tough to ask my mom for time off without her prying into my personal life to find out why, but my family has always reinforced the value of hard work, dedication, and an unshakable work ethic. I'm learning from the best.\n\nBeing able to work with my family is one of the luckiest lots in life I could have pulled. The frustrations are real, and the challenges of a small (but mighty) set of family businesses are ever-present.\n\nHowever, I can never deny the privilege of learning and growing with the ones I love. I'm not sure how long I'll work in the family business, but I feel prepared for whatever path I may walk next — with a strong base of support behind me.",

    "description": "Laura Ziegler led Louisville Cardinals women's basketball past the Florida State Seminoles in an ACC college basketball game Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Louisville women’s basketball was forced to deviate from its normal game-opening play — a pass in the low post to Anaya Hardy for a quick layup — against Florida State on Sunday.\n\nThe Seminoles took the look away from the ninth-ranked Cardinals. The only problem was that their double team left Laura Ziegler open. The senior called for the ball and nailed the shot beyond the arc. One minute later, Taj Roberts found Ziegler in the paint for a layup. After one quarter, Ziegler had either scored or assisted on seven of the Cardinals’ eight made field goals while tallying five rebounds.\n\nThe first 10 minutes of Louisville’s ACC game against Florida State (9-17, 4-10 ACC) is what the Saint Joseph’s transfer has been doing all season. And it yielded a similar result to all but four of the Cardinals’ games as Louisville (24-4, 14-1) took down the Seminoles, 88-65, on Sunday at the KFC Yum! Center.\n\nA day after UofL was projected to be a No. 2 seed in the first NCAA Tournament Top 16 reveal, Ziegler showed why as she helped the team build a 34-20 halftime lead. She neared triple-double territory by finishing with 14 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Louisville was +28 when she was on the court, covered every inch by contributing in some way. That ranged from bringing the ball up the floor to battling in the post or getting the outlet pass for a 3-point shot.\n\nZiegler’s versatility is something head coach Jeff Walz saw from her film at Saint Joseph’s. After getting her on campus, he tried her out at the point forward position.\n\n“She passed the ball well,\" Walz said last week. “And she handles it well enough that at the 4 spot, there aren't many 4 players that are going to pick her up full-court. So, the advantage to her then is like, 'Hey, no one's really harassing me a whole bunch.' And then when teams start to put guards on her, she's bigger than they are so she can see over them. And now we're making the pass up to our guard who's being guarded by a post.”\n\nZiegler has been open to any role the team needs her to play and contributes more than just scoring. Her leadership as one of only two seniors on the roster has been invaluable. Beyond the intangibles, Ziegler leads the team in rebounds per game (7.2) and is second in points (11.5) and assists per game (2.9).\n\nHer all-around effort has helped Louisville to one of its most successful seasons over the past few years and will continue to be important with the postseason looming.\n\nLouisville is off Thursday and returns to the KFC Yum! Center to host Virginia at noon next Sunday.\n\nReach Louisville football, women's basketball and baseball beat writer Alexis Cubit at acubit@gannett.com and follow her on X at @Alexis_Cubit.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Louisville women's basketball, Laura Ziegler roll past Florida State",

    "fullText": "Healthcare is draining Social Security checks, and the squeeze is getting worse.\n\nOut-of-pocket healthcare spending in retirement is mountains more than people plan for. Even including Medicare coverage and ignoring long-term care, retirees face sizable out-of-pocket costs for premiums, copays, and uncovered medical services.\n\nHow do medical inflation rates compare to Social Security adjustments?\n\nHow much do healthcare costs consume of Social Security benefits?\n\nWhy are Medicare Advantage plans less beneficial long-term?\n\nWhat strategies help manage rising healthcare costs in retirement?\n\nThese bills eat up roughly a third of a typical retiree’s Social Security income and almost a quarter of total income, according to a new report from the Center for Retirement at Boston College.\n\n“Retirees get this because they’re writing the checks now, but those nearing retirement need to realize that this is coming up,” Matthew Rutledge, an economist and the report’s author, told Yahoo Finance. “It's a rude awakening for people once they get to retirement.”\n\nFor about half of seniors, monthly Social Security benefits provide at least 50% of their income, and for about 1 in 4 seniors, it provides at least 90% of income. For 27% — 6.4 million seniors — it’s their only source of income.\n\nIn January, the estimated average monthly Social Security retirement benefit was $2,071, according to Social Security Administration data.\n\nFor women, those checks tend to be smaller. The average woman’s monthly Social Security check is roughly one-quarter less than the average man’s due in part to lower pay over their working years, time out of the workforce for caregiving, and more part-time work.\n\nThe bad news is that healthcare costs aren’t subsiding.\n\n“Moving forward, we're going to see really big portions of people's Social Security checks going toward medical costs,” Rutledge said.“The picture isn’t going to get any better anytime soon.”\n\nEven basic medical care early in retirement is expensive. “Medicare premiums have risen quite high, much faster than inflation over the last few years,” Rutledge said.\n\nIn 2026, for example, the monthly Part B premium rate is $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from last year. And the annual Part B deductible, which most people must pay before their Medicare coverage begins, rose by $26 this year, to $283.\n\nWhat’s more, medical inflation is projected to climb at more than double the rate of Social Security cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs).\n\nHealth-related cost inflation is expected to remain high with a projected long-term inflation rate of 5.8% (based on a 65-year-old couple retiring in 2026, with average health and national average costs), according to a new report from data firm HealthView Services. Social Security COLAs are projected to rise by only 2.4%.",

    "description": "MacKenzie Scott has donated $26 billion in the past several years.",
    "fullText": "MacKenzie Scott has been one of the most generous philanthropists during the past few years, and an episode in college may help explain why.\n\nAfter finalizing her divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2019, Scott ended up with a load of shares she earned from helping to build the e-commerce giant during its early days, when she helped with business plans and contracts. Upon their divorce, Scott received roughly a 4% stake in Amazon, or about 139 million shares at the time.\n\nSince 2020, Scott has reduced her stake by 42%, selling or donating about 58 million shares. The philanthropist is still worth nearly $28 billion today, despite having donated $26 billion through her philanthropic platform Yield Giving, which she founded in 2022. Yield Giving has donated to thousands of organizations, focused on issues including DEI, education, disaster recovery, and more.\n\nThis fall alone, she donated well over $400 million to several education- and DEI-focused organizations, many of which received the largest gifts in their respective histories.\n\nScott sees the value of and need for support, especially during someone’s early, formative years. After all, she had to borrow money from her college roommate when she was struggling.\n\n“It is these ripple effects that make imagining the power of any of our own acts of kindness impossible,” Scott wrote of giving in an Oct. 15 essay published to her Yield Giving site. “Whose generosity did I think of every time I made every one of the thousands of gifts I’ve been able to give?\n\n“It was the local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college. It was the college roommate who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year.”\n\nAfter graduating from Princeton University, Scott went on to become a talented novelist—a product of none other than Toni Morrison’s teaching. And in 2005, Scott published her debut novel, The Testing of Luther Albright, which won an American Book Award in 2006. Morrison reviewed the book as “a rarity: a sophisticated novel that breaks and swells the heart.”\n\nHer roommate from Princeton saw the difference that the $1,000 gift had made in her life, and that inspired her roommate to start a company 20 years later that offers loans to low-income students without a cosigner.\n\nThat roommate was Jeannie Ringo Tarkenton, who went on to found Funding U, which has provided $80 million in low-interest loans to about 8,000 students who needed help to pay for college, according to Princeton. Tarkenton still plays it cool, though, when asked about how she changed Scott’s life.",

    "description": "The Big Ten has tossed the idea around of a 24-team College Football Playoff, does that makes sense for Notre Dame?",
    "fullText": "It seems like it’s inevitable that the College Football Playoff will expand, especially after Notre Dame got left out of the field this past season when it was clear they should have been in.\n\nWhile having a larger field than the current 12-team format would water down the competition, it’s pretty clear that some sort of expansion needs to happen. Leaving out worthy teams for others that aren’t nearly as well regarded just doesn’t make sense, and it looks like the Big Ten has been looking into a 24-team tournament.\n\nESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that they have had internal discussions of doubling the field. He shared what the bracket would look like, and it doesn’t look all that bad. While I have been adamant that 12-team was too many, if the scheduling gets fixed, which it would almost have to with this many teams, it wouldn’t be terrible.\n\nThere could be exceptions for longer layoffs to get the games to be played on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, as the idea also would get rid of conference championship games. Another idea they floated around was avoiding rematches in the first round, which isn’t the worst idea.\n\nAs for Notre Dame’s view on this, they want some sort of expansion, but most likely not this large. Athletic director Pete Bevacqua would rather see 16-teams, but the Irish most likely don’t have enough cards to make sure that happens. It looks like the Big Ten and SEC hold the most power in these discussions, so it’s most likely a wait-and-see situation for Notre Dame.\n\nNEW: An internal Big Ten document explores a 24-team College Football Playoff. It offers a peek at what that model could look like, as another off-season of CFP discussion is set to unfold.

    "fullText": "SURPRISE—Arizona began last season with three consecutive losses but ended up making it to the College World Series. Something to consider when evaluating the first result of the season.\n\nThe Wildcats dropped their 2026 opener on Friday night, losing 10-7 to Stanford at Surprise Stadium. It snapped a 6-game win streak against their former Pac-12 rivals.\n\nArizona pitchers combined to issue seven walks, something they only did four times all of last season. Three of those were by starter Owen Kramkowski, a career high for the junior right-hander, who didn’t make it out of the 4th inning.\n\nStanford also stole six bases, part of an inauspicious UA debut behind the plate for catcher Roman Meyers, who also was charged with catcher’s interference that led to the Cardinal’s first run.\n\n“Those are things we’ve got to take care of,” said UA coach Chip Hale, who laid equal blame on UA pitchers not being quick enough to the plate. “We’ve got to be more accountable. Teams last year I think were a little leery to run on us with (Adonys Guzman) behind the plate, he had a good reputation. And Roman throws as well as anybody in the country, we just have to give him a chance.”\n\nArizona had 11 hits, its most in a season opener since 2019, but also struck out 15 times. The Wildcats had won 28 consecutive games when scoring at least seven runs including 24-0 in 2025.\n\nKramkowski, who is a projected high draft pick, allowed five runs (four earned) in 3.1 innings. He gave up six hits but three were not well hit.\n\n“He threw way too many pitches in the first couple innings,” Hale said. “I think there was probably what, four balls that literally were squibbers, bloopers. It just adds up on his pitch count, and the first time out, we’re not gonna let him go past the 80-pitch mark. He was not at all as effective as he was last year.”\n\nBut Kramkowski was off the hook after Arizona scored three in the bottom of the 4th to tie it at 5. Oregon State transfer Carson McEntire had an RBI single and Milwaukee transfer Tyler Bickers followed with a 2-run single.\n\nStanford broke it open with a 5-run 6th against a pair of transfer relievers. Nolan Straniero walked three and allowed a 2-run triple, leaving down 8-5, then lefty Patrick Morris gave up a 2-run homer.\n\nThe UA got two back in the bottom of the 6th on back-to-back homers by Meyers and McEntire, though Meyers’ shot was almost erased. Stanford appealed to second base saying Meyers missed the bag, with the 2B umpire calling him out, but Hale challenged and the call was overturned.\n\nThe UA couldn’t do anything else at the plate after that, despite three scoreless innings of relief from senior Matthew Martinez with seven strikeouts. The Wildcats got the leadoff man on in the 7th and 9th, doing so in all but two innings, but also struck out seven times in the last three frames.\n\n“I think we battled, we gave ourselves a chance,” Hale said. “They threw a couple freshmen that we didn’t have any info on, and they did terrific. They outplayed us tonight.”\n\nBickers, McEntire, Meyers and Andrew Cain each had two hits, with Bickers and McEntire driving in two runs each. McEntire, a Peoria native, was playing on the same field where he made his collegiate debut last season with Oregon State.\n\n“I thought it was a good game overall,” McEntire said. “There’s some stuff that we work on as a team, and me personally, that I will go down and talk to some coaches about and see what we can do better tomorrow.”\n\nMcEntire and his new team will be facing his old team on Saturday, as the Wildcats get the Beavers at 2 p.m. MT. OSU, which lost 5-3 to Michigan on Friday, regularly begins its season at Surprise Stadium and the vast majority of the 5,683 in attendance for the day were wearing orange.\n\n“The Beavs come out and show this place out every year,” McEntire said. “This is a thing for them, and it’s awesome to see their fans.”\n\nSophomore righty Smith Bailey will start for Arizona against OSU lefty Ethan Kleinschmit.",

Our thoughts and prayers are with Carter’s family, we cannot imagine the depth of their loss, and we are holding them close in our hearts.”\n\nJohnson was a freshman from South Dakota, according to the outlet.\n\nThe crash, which also injured the other 32 passengers aboard the team’s bus, happened on Highway 4 near Twin Lakes just after 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 11, the Iowa State Patrol (ISP) confirmed in a press release.\n\nCiting police, KCRG reported that the team’s 74-year-old bus driver veered off the road and crashed when he overcorrected while trying to get back in the lane, rolling the bus over into a ditch along the highway. Two of the passengers were reportedly ejected from the bus and trapped under the bus when it came to a stop. A van carrying other student-athletes that was traveling behind the team’s bus stopped, and the classmates attempted to perform CPR on Johnson, who died at the scene, according to the outlet.\n\nAt the time of the deadly crash, the baseball team was on their way to play North Arkansas College in Harrison, Ark., the Northark Pioneers confirmed in a Facebook post.\n\n\"Our hearts are heavy as we grieve alongside the Iowa Lakes College community,” Dr. Rick Massengale, North Arkansas College president, said in a statement. “The loss of a life is a tragedy that reaches far beyond one campus.”",

    "fullText": "In 2021, Santa Barbara City College received a $20 million gift from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, the largest donation in school history\n\nJust weeks ago, the school's Board of Trustees issued a statement saying they were \"disappointed to learn\" that some of that gift was \"used without explicit authorization\"\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, Santa Barbara City College Foundation CEO Bobbi Abram acknowledged the \"accounting process failure,\" but stressed that the money was used \"in the spirit of the donor’s intent\"\n\nA California community college was gifted $20 million from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott — but some of the money was used without proper authorization, according to officials.\n\nSanta Barbara City College Board of Trustees President Jonathan Abboud said in a statement late last month that the board was \"concerned\" by the \"unauthorized use\" of the 2021 donation from Scott, the largest in the school's 112-year history.\n\nIn a separate statement obtained by PEOPLE, the Santa Barbara City College Foundation said the donation \"effectively funded a large portion of\" their Promise Program, which provides tuition assistance, books and other supplies for local high school students.\n\nBobbi Abram, CEO of the SBCC Foundation, told SFGATE that about $10.5 million of the billionaire philanthropist's donation was used toward the program from 2021 to 2024.\n\nAbram said that the funds were used without approval from the foundation's board, Santa Barbara City College officials or the school's board of trustees, according to the outlet.\n\nNow, $13 million is left of Scott's original gift.\n\nAbboud went on to say that while the board of trustees were \"disappointed\" to learn what happened, they were \"nevertheless grateful to the SBCC Foundation’s current leadership and staff for identifying the past unauthorized activity and initiating a comprehensive review of the SBCC Foundation's past accounting practices and swiftly improving internal controls.\"\n\nThe school noted that its board of trustees had initiated its own investigation as the SBCC Foundation is a separate legal entity.\n\nMoving forward, Abboud said the SBCC Board \"will continue to work collaboratively with the SBCC Foundation to address this matter appropriately and ensure full transparency and accountability for the use of the gift funds.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment by PEOPLE, Abram said the foundation wants to stress that the funds were not \"misused.\"\n\n\"More than 1,800 local students are supported by the Promise each year.  This is a nationally recognized program which makes higher education accessible for local families,\" Abram said. \"Using some of the Scott gift funds for the Promise was not a 'misuse.' It was entirely consistent with the Foundation’s mission and in the spirit of the donor’s intent.\"\n\n\"What it was is an accounting process failure and a lack of transparency and authorization which we discovered in 2025 and now have corrected,\" Abram continued.\n\nSBCC's student newspaper The Channels and SFGATE reported that Abram took over as SBCC Foundation’s CEO in May 2024 and conducted an audit after finding inconsistencies in the accounting records early last year.\n\n“Because this misstatement happened on the fund level, it was outside the scope of [a previous] audit, and was the responsibility of previous management to report it to the auditors,” Abram told SFGATE.\n\nAbram said that the SBCC Foundation is working to keep a closer eye on its accounting moving forward to prevent situations such as these, according to the Santa Barbara Independent.\n\nScott has made many notable donations to educational institutions and other organizations around the country.\n\nIn 2020, according to a report from Rutgers University, she gave more than $560 million to 23 historically Black colleges and universities across the country.\n\nAnalyzing the immediate impact of Scott's donations, Rutgers researchers found that, \"on average, the median enrollment of new students was more than 300 students greater for HBCUs that received funding when compared to the median enrollment for those that did not receive funding.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nAccording to SFGATE, she also gave $38 million to the University of California, Merced just after gifting $50 million to California State University, East Bay. In 2025 alone, she gave more than $7.1 billion to nonprofit groups.\n\nScott, who is dedicated to giving away the majority of her fortune during her lifetime, currently has an estimated to have a net worth of nearly $40 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nIn the years since her divorce divorce from Jeff Bezos became official in 2019, resulting in an approximately $36 billion settlement, Scott has “transformed” philanthropy with her sizable, unrestricted donations, according to a three-year study published by the Center for Effective Philanthropy last year.",

    "description": "When I studied abroad in college, I attended the school that just unseated Harvard as one of the best in the world: Zhejiang University in China",
    "fullText": "In the spring of 2013, I was a sophomore at Tufts University in Massachusetts, soon to declare a dual major in international relations and Mandarin Chinese.\n\nDespite my lofty aspirations to travel the world as a diplomat, my academic career so far had taken me a whopping 25 miles north of my hometown. That's why my university's study abroad program in China appealed to me.\n\nOnce I heard the tales of adventure from the 2012 program's freshly minted graduates, I eagerly applied. That summer, with an acceptance letter in hand, I set off to enroll at Zhejiang University.\n\nUpon landing in Shanghai, my American classmates and I were piled into a minibus for the two-hour drive south to the garden city of Hangzhou — capital of Zhejiang Province and home to Zhejiang University (affectionately referred to by locals as ZheDa).\n\nAfter settling into the dorm, which was a single room with a private bathroom, we were welcomed by our professors with a banquet at the college's canteen — an establishment which was far better than the standardized cafeteria fare that I'd come to know back in New England.\n\nIn our dormitory building, for the equivalent of $2 at the time, one could acquire a filling meal any time of the day — from rice porridge and steamed buns in the morning to stir-fried vegetables and sweet and sour pork tenderloin in the evening, all cooked fresh to order.\n\nZhejiang University was massive and spread across multiple campuses throughout the city. Fortunately for us newcomers, our group at the University's International College was tucked into a leafy hillside on the historic Yuquan campus, offering a slice of Chinese university life at an approachable scale.\n\nAs the sweltering days of summer transitioned into an osmanthus flower-scented autumn, I settled into a new school year. Each morning consisted of four hours of intensive language instruction, followed by at least a few more hours of homework and self-study in the afternoon.\n\nIn addition, each week we'd attend one three-hour lecture on Chinese Peasant History with our advisor, who drew heavily from his own experiences as an academic sent to the countryside during Mao's Cultural Revolution.\n\nI also had a three-hour lecture on the Chinese Legal System with a professor who'd argued many cases within China's rapidly evolving court system.\n\nWhile my application to enroll in Zhejiang University was relatively quick and painless, the road to admission for most of ZheDa's domestic student population was comparatively long and grueling.\n\nFrom an early age, they'd studied for hours at school, followed by hours at buxiban (cram schools), preparing to ace China's notoriously difficult standardized exams, such as the Gaokao. Of the millions who sit for the Gaokao each year, only the highest scorers earn spots in China's most prestigious schools, such as Peking, Tsinghua, and Zhejiang universities.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the academic work ethic that carried students to Zhejiang University did not fall off after admission. While most of my international classmates would study long hours during the week, we would take Friday nights and weekends off to travel within China. But many local students, however, rarely engaged in such frivolous pursuits and were more likely to be studying in the library on a Friday or Saturday evening.\n\nAs exams marked the end of my semester at ZheDa in December 2013, I personally experienced the exacting academic standards that my Chinese classmates were intimately familiar with. While I did pass all of my classes, a minor error in pronunciation or a stroke askew in a written character, mistakes that my Chinese professors back at Tufts may have overlooked, were marked down harshly by my professors at Zhejiang University.\n\nWhen scrolling Instagram in January 2025, I saw a familiar sight in a post from The New York Times — a statue of Mao Zedong standing before Laohe Hill and a familiar library, waving to the students on a verdant Yuquan Campus. Reading on, I was proud to learn that my study abroad alma mater had been named the most productive research university in the world by Leiden Rankings, outpacing even my hometown juggernaut, Harvard.\n\nI cannot say that I am shocked by this development. My semester at ZheDa showed me a culture of academic rigor on a scale few American universities can match, drawing from an academic talent pool far larger than in the US.\n\nMy time at ZheDa forced me out of my comfort zone and exposed me to an academic world significantly different from that in which I'd been educated, and I believe I am a more open-minded learner for it.",

    "fullText": "Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss has secured the ability to return to the program for another year.\n\nVia Pete Thamel of ESPN.com, a Mississippi judge has granted Chambliss a preliminary injunction against the NCAA. Among other things, the judge concluded that the NCAA acted in bad faith when denying Chambliss a medical redshirt based on a respiratory issue that kept him from playing in 2022, while enrolled at Ferris State. He didn't play a single snap that year, and he didn't dress for games.\n\nThe selection of a Mississippi state court clearly helped Chambliss. It's a home-court advantage to have the case resolved by a Mississippi judge who was elected by (and presumably hopes to be re-elected by) Mississippi voters. As it would be for any student at any school based in any state where the NCAA operates.\n\nGiven that the order will apply as the case proceeds, Chambliss will be permitted to play unless the presiding judge resolves the case in the NCAA's favor before the end of the 2026 season — or unless the NCAA can overturn the ruling via appeal to a higher Mississippi court.\n\nIn the face of its latest courtroom failure, the NCAA was predictably defiant.\n\n\"This decision in a state court illustrates the impossible situation created by differing court decisions that serve to undermine rules agreed to by the same NCAA members who later challenge them in court,\" the NCAA said in a statement. \"We will continue to defend the NCAA's eligibility rules against repeated attempts to rob future generations of the opportunity to compete in college and experience the life-changing opportunities only college sports can create.\n\n\"The NCAA and its member schools are making changes to deliver more benefits to student-athletes, but the patchwork of state laws and inconsistent, conflicting court decisions make partnering with Congress essential to provide stability for current and future college athletes.\"\n\nThat's code for the ongoing plea to get Congress to federalize college sports, and to allow the schools to return to the days of blatant antitrust violations. To date, that effort has gone nowhere.\n\nAnd the NCAA's ridiculous sky-is-falling! message is exhausting. If Trinidad Chambliss, or anyone else, has remaining eligibility, he should be entitled to use it. If the folks at Ole Miss decide it's in the best interests of the program to keep Chambliss on the field and if he can show that the rules should give him another year, the ridiculous rhetoric about \"future generations\" being \"robbed\" of \"opportunity\" should be ignored. It's not making the NCAA's current situation or reputation any better.\n\nIn recent years, the NCAA has gradually been exposed as nothing more than a shield behind which the various schools had previously hidden to justify not paying players. And even though the NCAA surely pines for the days when it had real power, the institution is currently nothing more than a toothless, arbitrary bureaucracy.\n\nFrankly, the sooner the NCAA goes away, the better off the member universities and their student-athlete-employees will be. The NCAA is currently trying to help only itself, by finding a solution to the current college-sports chaos that doesn't result in the NCAA's extinction.",

    "fullText": "In the normal WNBA calendar, February is generally a good time to check in on the state of the draft. The college season is about three-fourths complete, allowing for ample scouting of the domestic prospects. The European and Australian seasons are in full swing as well for international prospects.\n\nOf course, this isn’t a normal WNBA offseason. The college and international seasons have proceeded according to plan, but without a new CBA, there has been no free agency and not a single trade since the Nov. 23 draft lottery, when The Athletic published its first mock draft of this season. As a result, the draft order is the same as it was in November — it actually remains undecided, as we still don’t know where in the 15-team order expansion teams will select.\n\nNevertheless, enough time has passed and enough has changed in the evaluation of this year’s class to warrant another mock draft. Expect a lot more movement once the WNBA’s offseason begins in earnest.\n\nDallas should be the biggest winner of 2026 free agency. With the league’s newest superstar Paige Bueckers under contract and a practice facility scheduled to open in April, the Wings have two enormous carrots to dangle in front of the league’s best players, and as has been repeated ad nauseam, almost every veteran in the WNBA is available to change teams. If all goes according to plan, this is the last time Dallas will be drafting in the lottery in the foreseeable future. As a result, the Wings should take a big swing, and that swing is Awa Fam.\n\nThe 19-year-old is a fantastic athlete and already shows veteran instincts on the defensive end. Her upside as a rim protector and play finisher is the highest in the class. It’s worth noting her offense hasn’t exactly popped in EuroLeague, as she’s averaging seven points and less than six rebounds this season. But Fam is still playing more than 20 minutes per game against the highest level of European competition and holding her own as a teenager. That usually bodes well for WNBA prospects.\n\nThe length of Awa Fam has been evident in some brief 1Q moments vs Estepona, but there’s this one:\n\n– able to block Sika Kone (W-level player) after a slip & finish attempt https://t.co/UpvqFv15st pic.twitter.com/TkbeCnprrV\n\n— Alford Corriette (@alfcorriette) February 7, 2026\n\nWNBA talent evaluators have been waiting five years to see Azzi Fudd healthy and playing consistently. The UConn guard has finally delivered in her super senior season. She has played every game and is averaging career-bests in points (17.4), assists (3.0) and steals (2.4). She is also shooting the absolute leather off the ball. Even after a relative slump during January, Fudd is making 53 percent of her 2s and 45 percent of her 3s. She doesn’t get to the line much but is near automatic when she does, missing only two free throws all season.\n\nFudd still doesn’t project as a No. 1 scoring option. Her handle is a little limited, and she has used only eight percent of her possessions in isolation or as a pick-and-roll ballhandler, per Synergy. But she is particularly valuable as a spot-up threat in the half court and in transition with her high, steady release, and she is equally excellent coming off screens and handoffs. Fudd has also been a high-impact defender. She is an easy fit on any roster, especially a franchise that has historically valued Huskies products.\n\nMiles’ drop from my last mock draft has little to do with her own production and more to do with Fudd’s ascent. In her first season at TCU, Miles has been as dominant as ever running the show, even with an entirely new set of teammates. She can make every read and every pass in the halfcourt and in transition, and when defenses play her as a scorer, Miles gets to the rim and scores efficiently. The swing skill with Miles was her 3-point shooting, and though she hasn’t been as productive as she was in 2024-25 at Notre Dame, she is still making 35.2 percent of her triples and 39 percent of her catch-and-shoot attempts. Considering Miles has also improved her free-throw percentage to 85.2 percent, her jumper should be plenty good enough for the pro level and force defenders to stay honest with her on the perimeter.\n\nThe main drawback with Miles is her lack of defensive playmaking, but that’s less important at point guard than at any other position. Her turnover rate is also a smidge high; however, that’s the creativity tax for her audacious passing.\n\nThe Mystics hope to have their center of the future in Shakira Austin. In his most recent public comments, Washington president Michael Winger said as much while acknowledging the uncertainty of her future as a restricted free agent. “I love Kira, I foresee her being a part of this team for a long time,” he said. “She’ll have the opportunity to explore her options. I hope that we are an attractive option for her.”\n\nIf Austin chooses to move on, what a great opportunity to reunite what should have been the latest in a long line of dominant Stanford frontcourt duos. Betts and Kiki Iriafen only played one season together in Palo Alto — and Betts barely saw the floor as a freshman — but their games have grown to complement each other. Iriafen has a smooth face-up game, and Betts thrives without the ball in her hands as a screener and on put-backs. While Iriafen can cover more mobile forwards and even perimeter players, Betts is a dominant paint defender, arguably the best rim protector in college basketball; opponents shoot 13 percent worse at the rim when Betts is in the game, per CBB Analytics.\n\nSydney Johnson developed the Mystics’ identity as a defensive team in his first season in Washington. With cornerstones already on the wing (Sonia Citron) and at power forward, Betts is another strong defensive piece to add to the young core.\n\nThe goal of this exercise wasn’t to recreate great college teams of recent memory, but it is a happy accident. Flau’jae Johnson could pair with not one, but two former LSU teammates in Chicago: Angel Reese and Hailey Van Lith. More importantly, the Sky need a perimeter shot creator.\n\nJohnson’s usage has decreased with the Tigers’ increased depth this season, but her efficiency is as good as ever. She gets such good lift on her jumper and excels off screens and as a spot-up shooter. Johnson is a force on the offensive glass, especially for her position. It’s a little concerning that she still isn’t LSU’s No. 1 option as a senior, but her Tigers keep winning, and she finds a way to help them find success no matter the surrounding context. Seeing Johnson under a coach who prioritizes offensive initiation from the wings would be interesting.\n\nThis is probably too high for a role player, even one as highly regarded as Jaquez. At some point, I might have to course correct. But everyone I’ve spoken to in the WNBA loves Jaquez. She can play multiple positions. She shoots well (62.9 percent on 2s, 43.8 percent on 3s and 87.5 percent on free throws), moves off the ball — UCLA scores a ridiculous 1.47 points per possession off of her cuts, per Synergy — and defends.\n\nEvery time Jaquez takes the floor, she seems to get a little better. If you’re building a culture from the ground up, you couldn’t do better than opting for the life Jaquez breathes into a program.\n\nThis is another pick that hasn’t changed since November. After winning the EuroLeague’s young player of the year award last season, Martín is averaging 12.5 points and 5.2 assists in EuroCup games in 2025-26. That would have been a top 10 assist mark among qualified players in the WNBA last season. Her team is 9-1 in those contests with a 20-year-old running point. Martín’s 3-point percentage has dropped 10 percent since last season, but her free-throw percentage has gone up by a similar margin to 82.8.\n\nThe French wave is inevitable. After the rapid success of Dominique Malonga and Leïla Lacan, there’s much less skepticism about French prospects and how they perceive the WNBA. France is developing an incredible generation of talent, and if those players want to come to the U.S., the WNBA is more than happy to have them.\n\nIt should come as little surprise that a foreign player is mocked to Golden State after the Valkyries rostered 10 internationals over the course of their debut season. Angloma is on the come-up thanks to a prolific scoring season in France’s top league. Opponents can’t stop Angloma from getting to the basket, even though she doesn’t have much of a jump shot. She’s averaging 16.2 points per game and earning 6.1 free-throw attempts per contest. At 19, she already has the physicality to survive in the league, though her jumper will have to improve to make her a viable shooting guard or small forward.\n\nKneepkens led the Big 12 in effective field-goal percentage and free-throw percentage last season, making 57 percent of her 2s, 45 percent of her 3s and 89 percent of her foul shots. Since transferring to UCLA, she has become even more efficient from every area. Kneepkens is simply one of the best shooters college basketball has seen in recent years, no matter her usage. The Bruins improve their effective field-goal percentage by 7.6 percent when Kneepkens is on the floor.\n\nShe uses an unorthodox form on her jump shot, but after five seasons in three conferences, there is enough of a track record to believe it will translate to the professional level. The Mystics took and made the fewest 3s in the WNBA in 2025. Bringing in an ace shooter like Kneepkens is a quick way to fix that.\n\nLeger-Walker is the second-best pure point guard in this class behind Miles, though her age (she turns 25 in September) limits her upside relative to Martín. Nevertheless, she knows how to run an offense and makes a mean skip pass. She’s also a bully on drives and has become a surprisingly good screen navigator on defense at UCLA after being a more inattentive defender during her Washington State days.\n\nAll of those attributes make her a useful complement to Caitlin Clark. Leger-Walker can give Clark opportunities to play off the ball, letting the Fever star come off screens and function as a movement shooter instead of having to bring the ball up and do all of the shot creation. Leger-Walker’s passing craft rivals Clark’s, allowing her to mimic some of Clark’s sets as a backup point guard.\n\nIndiana is trying to win now, and Leger-Walker has as much experience as possible for a rookie. In addition to her six years of college basketball, she has been playing for the New Zealand national team since age 16.\n\nKiki Rice has been the starting point guard for UCLA for four seasons, and I’m still uncertain if she can be a point guard in the pros. But the WNBA is trending more positionless; not every team needs a classic floor general if they have playmaking at other positions. And regardless of Rice’s position, she has enough certainties in her game. She defends the point of attack (she has the second-best defensive on-off differential for the Bruins behind Betts), she puts pressure on the rim, and she holds herself accountable. Rice shot 21.7 from 3-point range and 79.1 percent from the foul line as a freshman; those figures are 40 percent and 89.5 percent as a senior. Bring Rice home to D.C. and let her continue to improve through Washington’s rebuild.\n\nAnother balanced attack last night, 4️⃣ Bruins finished in double figures! #GoBruins pic.twitter.com/iF2e6k6fxk\n\n— UCLA Women’s Basketball (@UCLAWBB) February 10, 2026\n\nThe Sun have a ton of defensive talent on the perimeter with Lacan and Saniya Rivers. They don’t have much offensive pop. Let Latson change that. The adjustment to South Carolina has been a bit more uneven than Latson or the Gamecocks might have hoped, but she is still a fearsome scorer and dynamic downhill attacker; 47.4 percent of her shot attempts come within 4.5 feet of the rim, and she earns 5.8 free-throw attempts per game. Connecticut will have to find some stretch bigs to accommodate spacing challenges at other positions, but Latson will insist her way to the basket no matter who else is on the floor. The Sun could desperately use that type of player.\n\nThe Dream are building around Rhyne Howard, Allisha Gray and Naz Hillmon, and that trio needs an organizing force at point guard. That’s Raven Johnson. She controls pace, knows how to get all of her teammates involved and is loath to hijack possessions when a better option presents itself. She also has consistently helmed great defenses and makes dribbling difficult for opposing guards for 94 feet. If there were any consistency on her jump shot, she’d be a better prospect. Perhaps playing for Karl Smesko and being forced to launch from 3 will improve her confidence in her jumper.\n\nJackson looks like a 3-and-D player — she has a pro body and takes a high volume of 3-pointers, and she does so confidently. The stats don’t totally support that hypothesis, neither the shooting nor the defense, though her 3-pointer was much better in the two seasons before this one. Yet, Jackson has been heavily relied upon by some excellent Duke teams. She makes her foul shots, a rarity for the Blue Devils in the Kara Lawson era. She’s emerged as a valuable playmaker. She holds up well in one-on-one defense and has improved as a screen-and-roll defender as she learns how to navigate those offensive possessions. She has a lot of tools to like, even if the whole package hasn’t quite come together at Duke.\n\nThis pick could go in many directions. In addition to the three players listed below, Grace VanSlooten, Dariana Littlepage-Buggs and Janiah Barker were all considered here. VanSlooten is a personal favorite, but it’s hard to justify picking her when the Sun already have two young power forwards in Aneesah Morrow and Aaliyah Edwards. Ultimately, the spot goes to Okot. She does exactly what you want from a center: seals her defender, protects the paint and boxes out. Okot has shown massive improvement in just two years of college basketball, and she’s young for this class since she won’t turn 22 until August. There is so much room to grow.\n\nAlso considered: Maggie Doogan (Richmond), Tonie Morgan (Kentucky), Laila Phelia (Syracuse)\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nMinnesota Lynx, New York Liberty, Seattle Storm, Los Angeles Sparks, Washington Mystics, Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Indiana Fever, Dallas Wings, Las Vegas Aces, Phoenix Mercury, Duke Blue Devils, UCLA Bruins, South Carolina Gamecocks, TCU Horned Frogs, Connecticut Huskies, LSU Lady Tigers, Golden State Valkyries, Portland Fire, Toronto Tempo, WNBA, Women's College Basketball\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

Unemployment for early childhood education majors was also among the highest, but a few educational fields had the lowest unemployment rates.\n\nThe chart below shows the college majors with rates above 6.0%.\n\nDaniel Zhao, the chief economist at Glassdoor, told Business Insider that the majors with the highest rates are interesting because they don't fit into a single group.\n\n\"You have some majors that have very restrictive job markets, like fine arts or performing arts, but then you also have other majors that have been very attractive and that offer high-paying jobs, like computer engineering or computer science,\" Zhao said.\n\nZhao pointed to underemployment rates, or the share of grads getting a job that doesn't usually need a degree. Computer engineering and computer science had underemployment rates below 20%, while anthropology, fine arts, and performing arts had rates above 50%.\n\n\"Say a computer science grad is having a hard time finding a job in tech in the current market, but they know that if they can land one, it'll be worth their while because the pay in tech is so much higher than other industries,\" Zhao said. \"So they're willing to sit it out and wait until a good role comes along.\"\n\nZhao said grads with anthropology or fine arts degrees \"don't necessarily have the financial cushion to not look for a job right now\" because these roles typically don't pay as much as a tech role.\n\nThe US just had the lowest year of job growth since 2003 outside recessions. While layoffs haven't ticked up much and unemployment remains low, hiring has tumbled from a few years ago, making it an especially rough market for people newly entering the workforce. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates was 5.6% in December, up from 4.8% at the start of 2025.\n\n\"This low-hire, low-fire trend has likely contributed to the rise in the unemployment rates of young workers,\" a research note from Goldman Sachs said, and added that it \"raises the risk that these workers might be increasingly locked out of the labor market.\"\n\nZhao suggested that job seekers in the slower job market work on networking, including leveraging career services at their alma mater and talking to alums. He also suggested people broaden their job search because there could be roles that need their skills that job seekers haven't considered applying for.\n\nHany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, previously told Business Insider that good jobs for computer science graduates aren't at \"the usual suspects.\"\n\n\"I have always contended that the most exciting applications of computer science are not at Facebook, Google, and Amazon, but at the intersection of computing and other fields,\" Farid said.\n\nThat can include computational drug discovery, computational finance, digital humanities, and other roles.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlthough the Ohio State Buckeyes failed to repeat as national champions this past season, they are part of a select group of three consecutive Big Ten teams to win it all.\n\nWhether this year will continue the conference's trend, the Buckeyes are going to attempt to remain in that mix for a league and national title under coach Ryan Day.\n\nSome analysts, including CBS Sports' Cody Nagel, aren't fond of the Buckeyes' national title hopes entering this fall as he assessed 25 teams in a way-too-early Top 25 network.\n\nNagel ranked the Buckeyes at No. 1 despite him predicting that they will lose at least three games for the first time in 15 seasons.\n\n\"Ohio State has been a perennial national championship contender for most of the 21st century and expects to be in the title hunt again in 2026,\" Nagel wrote. \"But the Buckeyes face more hurdles than usual with one of the nation's toughest schedules, including five opponents from [Brandon] Marcello's way-too-early top 25. Ohio State hasn't lost more than two games since 2011. If there was ever a year for that streak to end, this is it.\"\n\nMORE: Kirk Herbstreit shares true feelings about Michigan's Bryce Underwood entering 2026 season\n\nFurther along in Nagel's preview, he notes that the Michigan Wolverines will regain momentum in \"The Game\" rivalry this November. Therefore, it would give the Wolverines their first head-to-head win against Ohio State since 2024. To make matters worse for the Buckeyes, their Nov. 7 opponent (Oregon Ducks) are a potential national title pick. Therefore, another loss there seems more likely than not.\n\nShould the Buckeyes miss the postseason, it would further validate the fact that the pressure Day faces from the Buckeyes' fanbase is real, raw and unapologetic.\n\nIf Nagel is proven correct, the next year in Columbus is going to be extremely interesting.\n\nMORE: Patriots coach Mike Vrabel shares harsh reality after losing Super Bowl 60 to Seahawks\n\nIllinois 2026 football schedule\n\nMichigan 2026 football schedule\n\nOhio State 2026 football schedule",

    "description": "College basketball is in a chaotic state, creating a 'transactional' environment, as one coach puts it.",
    "fullText": "College sports are in a strange spot right now, and college basketball has become the latest flashpoint as eligibility battles between players and the NCAA dominate the headlines.\n\nThe most notable case is Alabama center Charles Bediako, who joined the Crimson Tide halfway through the season after spending multiple years in the NBA G League. His status has become a week‑to‑week spectacle, with each court appearance drawing national attention.\n\nThe latest ruling deemed him ineligible for the remainder of the season. And if not for the earning potential tied to NIL, there’s a strong argument that Bediako never would have returned to college basketball at all — he likely would have pursued opportunities overseas instead.\n\nNo matter where you fall on the state of college athletics, it’s clear something has to change. The most logical starting point is a universal eligibility checklist for each sport. Right now, the system is a patchwork of one‑off lawsuits, international exceptions, and inconsistent rulings that make the entire process feel arbitrary.\n\nThe second major issue is the transfer environment. Before NIL, giving players more mobility and immediate eligibility made sense. Coaches could leave at any moment, and players deserved protection. But now, with the offseason functioning as a de facto free‑agency period, it’s understandable that universities want more control over their “investment.” As uncomfortable as that sounds, it’s already happening — schools have begun suing players who leave after signing NIL deals.\n\nWhat’s getting lost in all of this is the original purpose of these institutions. They are supposed to be places of higher education first, with athletics second. That’s why academic standards exist in the first place. Legendary Houston coach Kelvin Sampson captured the frustration perfectly when discussing the current landscape:\n\n\"...there is nothing educational about college basketball right now. It's all transactional.\"\n\nAnd he’s not wrong. Programs across the country — including Texas A&M, which has navigated its own roster churn and NIL‑driven decisions — are feeling the effects of a system that changes by the month.\n\nWhere college sports go from here is anyone’s guess. What we do know is that the money will keep flowing, the athletes will keep getting paid, and the NCAA will continue fighting for relevance in a world it no longer fully controls.\n\nYou can see Coach Sampson’s full comments below.\n\n“We're still in an educational institution, but there is nothing educational about college basketball right now. It's all transactional. And we all put our heads in the sand.\" \n\nKelvin Sampson on the state of college basketball \n\n(Via @ChrisYBaldwin 🎥)\n\n pic.twitter.com/o5TtywTam0\n\n— Hoop Herald (@TheHoopHerald) February 1, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

They beat Maine in OT on Friday in their in-between game.\n\nHonestly, I don’t know. The Eagles simply laid an egg on Friday night against Vermont, getting blown out on home ice 6-1 and taking a big hit to their NPI.\n\nThe team was clearly distracted, and no one had a good game. There’s not really much to take away from it or much more I can say. It was a lackluster, uninspiring effort for a game that required them to stay focused and needed to end with them feeling confident. This is when you hope someone is able to rally the group with a short turnaround and remind them what they’re capable of – whether that’s the coaches or the captains or an unsung leader without a letter.\n\nThere’s a lot of noise surrounding the Eagles after their performance against Vermont, despite their strong showing against Harvard – they’re going to have to completely block it out and get back on track.",

    "description": "Steven Wang, David Kobrosky, and Eric Chen all dropped out of college to launch their ideas at the perfect time.",
    "fullText": "Steven Wang planned to start a business after graduating from Harvard.\n\nBut eight months into college life, in June 2021, he dropped out to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions, inspired by the boom in meme stocks and crypto.\n\nInvesting was one of his long-term interests, and Wang wanted to take advantage of that year's retail investor craze, and his company, Dub, was born.\n\nThe platform allows retail investors to automatically copy the trades of more experienced investors. In an interview published in February 2025, Wang told Business Insider that Dub had a team of around 25 people and had raised $17 million, including from Uber's CEO and Robinhood's founding chief operating officer.\n\nThe journey has come with trade-offs, he told Business Insider. Wang has sometimes felt jealous of friends who've been able to ride out the college experience, and he has fantasized about returning to study philosophy.\n\nIf the investor craze never happened, Wang said he would have probably finished his degree, but when he saw the opportunity presented by the growing investor movement, he couldn't let it go, he said. As someone with a deep love for building products, he believes he made the right choice.\n\nDavid Kobrosky dropped out of college twice. Once to work for the businessman and social media personality Gary Vaynerchuk, and once to build his own company.\n\nIn late 2020, at age 21, he left college to take advantage of an emerging market in digital connection prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, creating Intros AI, which uses artificial intelligence to help people connect and network.\n\nAfter eight months of bootstrapping, he raised funds from investors, including the White House AI advisor Siriam Krishnan. In July 2025, Kobrosky's business was acquired by a software company called Bevy.\n\nWith success came sacrifice. Kobrosky told Business Insider he used to work seven days a week and missed out on time with friends. Even after he was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, in early 2024, he worked 60 to 80 hours a week on the business while undergoing chemotherapy. He was told he was in remission in November 2024.\n\nLooking back, Kobrosky said he doesn't regret abandoning the traditional college route. He thinks starting and selling a business at his age set him up well for the future.\n\nWhen Eric Chen went to NYU in 2016, he pictured going into finance or tech after graduating. Then he found he could spend hours learning about blockchain technology without getting bored, and decided to immerse himself in that space rather than stay in college.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, Chen took a leave of absence from NYU and started Injective, a decentralized crypto exchange platform. Chen saw the moment as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for a young person like him to contribute to a nascent space without much prior experience.\n\nChen faced challenges like investors not buying into decentralized exchanges, and he said not having a degree probably didn't help his case. However, when the industry blew up in 2020, the company was able to raise a seed round, and Chen decided not to go back to NYU.\n\nIn an interview published in September 2025, Chen told Business Insider the company had raised $50 million and secured investment from Mark Cuban.\n\nChen concluded that the industry would have changed drastically if he'd waited a few more years to start Injective, and said those passionate about an opportunity they spot should take it.\n\nDo you have a story about dropping out of college to start a business?

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Daniel Kolcun, owner of Gridiron Football Prep. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI got let go from my job in 2021 as part of a companywide reduction.\n\nAt the time, I had been working in football product management at Wilson Sporting Goods, overseeing football products and working with teams, factories, and leather suppliers across college and professional football.\n\nWherever I went, the same topic of discussion came up: What's the best way to break in a football?\n\nI had been preparing footballs for years as an add-on service within my role for select teams.\n\nDuring COVID, that service expanded when equipment managers didn't have access to their facilities; they would ask for help, and I'd stay late, come in on weekends, or use downtime to prep footballs so they were ready to use.\n\nOver time, I learned how leather behaves in different weather, which products hold up, how to customize prep options to meet quarterbacks' needs, and which processes are duplicative.\n\nAfter the layoff, I had teams who were interested in continuing to work with me. So the day after I was let go, I started an LLC for my company, Gridiron Football Prep.\n\nI run Gridiron Football Prep out of my home in New Jersey with my wife, Emily, who handles product development and business operations. The workload is intense. At any given time, there can be hundreds of footballs in different stages of preparation — brushed, conditioned, balmed, mudded, and drying.\n\nWhen a football leaves the factory, it's missing key elements that prevent it from performing at the highest level. Quarterbacks may find it too slick, too stiff, or inconsistent in moisture, which can affect how the ball feels in their hands. Prepping a football to a quarterback's specific needs, so it feels more worn, tacky, soft, and usable in addition to performing better in different weather conditions.\n\nEvery football goes through a custom, multi-step process. There's brushing to open the leather's pores, conditioning to soften it, balming to add controlled tack, heat to bake products into the leather, and mudding to even the surface and help with moisture management.\n\nThe mud I use comes from New Jersey. I apply it by hand, so it spreads evenly across the leather and acts as an emulsifier, bringing the ball's natural tack to the surface. It also helps manage moisture and gives the football a more consistent color and feel.\n\nThe hands-on work averages at least 30 minutes per ball, but drying time stretches a full batch to about 72 hours. During peak season, I aim to finish roughly 50 footballs a day.\n\nOrders vary. Some college programs send 150 to 200 footballs before a season. Professional teams can go through hundreds over the course of a year. My pricing typically ranges from about $40 to $75 per ball, depending on volume, customization, and turnaround time.\n\nThe goal is simple: I don't want the quarterback thinking about the ball. If they're thinking about grip, something went wrong.\n\nFootball has been a part of my life for decades. I played the sport through high school and college, then stayed in the space through equipment work and product development roles over the years.\n\nI still watch football like a former player, but now I see it through a different lens — one shaped by deadlines, weather forecasts, and preparation cycles. Most of the time, the work I do doesn't show up on screen because that means the football is performing the way it's supposed to.\n\nThen there's the occasional snap where it matters. That might only be 1%. But sometimes, that 1% is enough to justify building a business around it.\n\nI never made it to the NFL as a player, but this is how I contribute to the game now.",

    "fullText": "ST. LOUIS – Kylee Doremus has been meeting with her team at Shriners Children’s Hospital in St. Louis.\n\n“A month ago, I got my leg fitted for me,” said Doremus, who is a Shriners Children’s St. Louis patient and Youth Parapan Games Gold Medalist. “They make a mold of my leg. Today, I got to try it on for the first time, and they have to do some adjustments to make it perfect for me.”\n\nOn Friday, Kylee’s father, Larry, accompanied her to see how the new prosthetic would fit. They have been visiting this location for the past nine years.\n\n“At 11 months, they put a prosthetic on her, and she hasn’t looked back,” Larry said. “We all have challenges and mountains that just look a little bit different, and that doesn’t mean you can’t succeed if you want to.”\n\nThanks to prosthetics, she’s played volleyball standing up. Kylee competed for the first time in Chile for the 2025 Youth Parapan Games in sitting volleyball, winning a gold medal.\n\nThis high schooler knows that surrounding yourself with a good team can lead to success and shared experiences. No one knows that better than Kylee’s prosthetist, Darren Rottman, a former Shriner’s kid with an artificial leg.\n\n“Then you hear, ‘I didn’t even know that until we saw it,’” Rottmann said. “We didn’t know that you were, when you were walking in. I think it just gives them a sense of to relax. Everything will be alright in the world in the long run.”\n\nKylee is aiming for the 2028 games in Los Angeles or the 2032 Paralympics in Australia. But for now, she has college on the horizon and determination to no end.\n\n“Know that you can do the standing or do what everyone else is doing,” Kylee said. “I didn’t know about volleyball, and I fell in love with it standing. And then, knowing what you can do and others can do, and you can do it better, too.”",

    "description": "The Eagles were no match for NU’s new-look offense.",
    "fullText": "No. 2 Northwestern (1-0, 0-0 B1G) began its season in Chestnut Hill on Friday in a rematch of the 2025 NCAA Final Four. No. 3 Boston College (0-1, 0-0 ACC) sought vengeance, while the ‘Cats looked to solidify their positioning above the Eagles in the polls.\n\nIn a battle of Tewaaraton finalists, Madison Taylor got the better of Shea Dolce in a dominant 20-12 Northwestern victory. The senior attacker led both teams with five goals in the contest, while Dolce struggled to contain a dynamic Northwestern offense, ending the day with a sub-.300 save percentage.\n\nAditi Foster posted a career-high four goals in her first start as a Wildcat, Taylor Lapointe contributed three, and Olivia Adamson, Maddie Epke, and Hannah Rudolph pitched in two apiece. Defensively, Jaylen Rosga led the charge with three caused turnovers and two ground ball pickups, while Madison Smith recorded seven draw controls in her return to the NU lineup. Jennika Cuocco stood out with 15 saves in her NU debut.\n\nAbbey Herod won the draw for the Eagles, ripping off three shots within the first minute and a half of the contest. A yellow card against Maddie Epke put BC at an early advantage, but their efforts inside the arc came up short.\n\nJenika Cuocco then logged her first save as a Wildcat, denying Molly Driscoll her first score of the season. Epke was the first to find the netting for NU in 2026 with a sidearm shot from the middle of the arc to the left of Eagles goalkeeper Shea Dolce.\n\nMadison Smith gave NU an opportunity to extend its lead by winning the subsequent draw, but Dolce denied Madison Taylor on her first shot attempt of the afternoon. Giulia Colarusso then tried to even the score for the Eagles, but to no avail, with Cuocco making her second stop of the day. Former Syracuse attacker Olivia Adamson followed up her JMU counterpart and got into the scoring column, with Taylor picking up the assist on the play.\n\nFollowing two Boston College misses, Taylor connected with Taylor Lapointe to get the ‘Cats a third straight goal as the clock ticked just past the nine-minute mark. It took a minute and a half for BC to respond, but Kelly Blake finally got the Eagles on the board with 7:37 remaining, beating Jaylen Rosga to her right for great positioning against Cuocco near the crease. BC’s Brooke McLoy found herself in the right place, at the right time in the arc, to scoop up a free position shot deflection and make the score 3-1.\n\nMaddy Taylor padded Northwestern’s lead to 4-2 at the 3:16 mark, getting defender Kaitlyn Cole in isolation and using her speed to beat her to the arc and get her shot off. That lead became 5-2 after a Taylor pass to Lapointe ricocheted off Lapointe’s body, then off Dolce’s stick, and into the mesh.\n\nAnnabel Child made her presence felt with two minutes remaining in the quarter, altering a Devon Russell free position shot and sending it over the net, leading to Aditi Foster’s first goal of her season. Child immediately added on to the Northwestern lead on a fastbreak after winning the next draw, as the ‘Cats poured it on in the first to start with a 7-2 lead.\n\nCuocco ended the first 15 minutes with six saves, including a denial of McLoy’s last-second shot. She got her seventh 34 seconds into period two.\n\nRosga made up for her first-period errors by causing an early turnover on BC’s second entry into the attacking third on the field, intercepting a Hanna Davis pass to begin the second quarter. Avery Hudson then ended the Eagles’ 10-minute scoring drought with the first free-position goal of the game. Marissa White tried to cut the ‘Cats lead to three, but was called for a yellow card for a dangerous follow-through, despite finding the net. She’d capitalize on her next opportunities, getting her first goal with 4:30 left in the half, and her second coming 80 seconds after with a shot over Child. Davis drew the Eagles within one by faking out Cuocco with 3:07 to go, turning a 7-2 deficit into a 7-6 one.\n\nWith their five-goal lead now reduced to one, Adamson found her second goal of the contest on a free position — NU’s first on the day. Cuocco held firm between the pipes in the final minute, stopping a point-blank fastbreak shot from Davis to keep the score 8-6 heading into halftime.\n\nAdamson, Lapointe, and Davis all walked away with two goals apiece. Taylor, who only ended with one, had a game-high of four points through the first 30 minutes, picking up three assists in the first quarter. Driscoll was the only Eagle to record an assist in the first half – five of BC’s six goals came unassisted.\n\nThird-quarter action kicked off with a bang, with Taylor and Foster going back-to-back to re-establish NU’s sizable lead. Taylor took advantage of a sleeping BC defense, with Lauren Archer cutting through the middle as a decoy to free up Taylor. Foster faked out Michaela O’Connor to free up a lane for her high-percentage shot to beat Dolce.\n\nColarusso entered the Eagles into the scoring column at the 11:02 mark on a free position, firing a shot that bounced past Cuocco. Taylor responded on a Northwestern power play, being the first player to log a hat trick Friday afternoon. Foster snuck past the Eagle defense to join Taylor in the hat trick club. NU led 12-7 halfway through the third.\n\nHannah Rudolph got involved in the scoring with a rocket shot from outside, while Epke notched her first assist as a Wildcat at the 7:24 mark. Colarusso got her second shortly after, shooting between the legs of Cuocco, but another Northwestern power play gave Lapointe and the ‘Cats a score. Lapointe became the third Wildcat to reach the three-goal mark, and Epke found her second on a free position inside two minutes remaining. At the end of the third quarter, the Wildcats led 15-8.\n\nTaylor’s fourth goal of the contest was found five minutes into the fourth quarter, as she used multiple fakes to put Dolce in limbo. Blake, who scored BC’s first goal of the game, got it a ninth on the day with 8:45 remaining. Colbert’s high shot that hit the cage’s right corner brought the Eagles to 10 with six left to go. Taylor let off a high shot of her own to beat Dolce for the fifth time.\n\nIn the dying moments of the game, Molly Driscoll got free on a fastbreak and snuck a shot to the left of Cuocco. Also getting her first goal of the game – the first of her career, in fact – was redshirt first-year Jenna Soto on NU’s next possession, finding a wide-open lane on a high-low cut and receiving a pass from Adamson for her shot.\n\nDriscoll’s second goal was the result of a ground ball pickup, off a blocked free position shot, as she bounced the shot off the turf and into the net.\n\nBoston College elected to pull Dolce from between the pipes to enter another defender, in hopes of gaining extra possessions in the final 70 seconds of the game. Foster took advantage of the empty net by beating the double-team with her speed for her fourth goal. Hannah Ruldolph was also a beneficiary of the empty net and dropped in her second goal, bringing Northwestern to a 20-12 win to end it.\n\nThe Wildcats will next play at Ryan Fieldhouse on Feb. 9, when they take on Colorado at 7 p.m. CT. Their matchup with the Buffaloes marks the start of a four-game homestand, with Army, Central Michigan, and Marquette to follow.",

    "fullText": "With the transfer portal window now closed, the full picture of roster movement is clear. Many programs saw heavy losses because of coaching changes. Others dealt with exits due to playing time or system changes. Some schools managed the damage quickly. Others now face long rebuilds. Here is a breakdown of the schools with the most transfer portal departures. (Via CFB)\n\nCal fired Justin Wilcox and hired Tosh Lupoi from Oregon. That move triggered roster turnover. A total of 35 players entered the portal. The Bears kept their most important player in quarterback Jaron Kaewe Sagapolutele. He impressed as a freshman in 2025. Cal added 31 new transfers to stabilize the roster. Keeping the starting quarterback helped limit the impact.\n\nAuburn made a coaching change by firing Hugh Freeze. That decision caused major exits. The biggest loss was wide receiver Cam Coleman, who transferred to Texas. Other departures included Kayin Lee, Kensley Louidor Faustin, Horatio Fields, Amaris Williams, Xavier Chaplin and Malik Blocton. New coach Alex Golesh rebuilt quickly. He added 39 transfers, including 13 from USF. Quarterback Byrum Brown followed Golesh and is expected to lead the offense.\n\nFlorida State finished 5-7 in 2025 and placed 13th in the ACC. That season led to heavy movement. A total of 36 players entered the portal. Key exits included Earl Little Jr., Lawayne McCoy, Randy Pittman, Edwin Joseph and Justin Cryer. Mike Norvell responded by adding 22 transfers. Quarterback Ashton Daniels and running back Tre Wisner are set to lead the offense in 2026.\n\nMichigan State fired Jonathan Smith and hired Pat Fitzgerald. The coaching change caused 37 players to leave. Losses included Makhi Frazier, Aisea Moa, Chance Rucker, Aidan Chiles and Nick Marsh. Quarterback Alessio Milivojevic stayed and finished the season as the starter. The Spartans added 28 transfers. Wide receiver KK Smith and center Trent Fraley were key additions.\n\nArkansas fired Sam Pittman during the season and hired Ryan Silverfield from Memphis. That move led to 38 portal entries. Jaheim Singletary and Jac’Qawn McRoy were among the top departures. Silverfield rebuilt fast by adding 41 new transfers. Arkansas ranked eighth in the On3 Team Transfer Portal Rankings. New players included Steven Soles from Kentucky and Jasper Parker from Michigan.\n\nMississippi State also had 38 players leave. Jeff Lebby enters his third year as head coach. The Bulldogs lost several starters, including Jayvin James to Alabama and Zack Owens to Missouri. Jayven Williams transferred to BYU, while Kedrick Bingley Jones went to Alabama. Quarterback KaMario Taylor stayed and is expected to start in 2026. Mississippi State added 24 transfers, including seven offensive linemen. Wide receiver Marquis Johnson joined from Missouri.\n\nWest Virginia continued reshaping its roster under Rich Rodriguez. The Mountaineers lost 44 players to the portal and added 34 new ones. Quarterback Michael Hawkins transferred from Oklahoma and is expected to start. Experience was lost on the offensive line with Donovan Haslam heading to Tennessee. Wide receiver Cam Vaughn transferred to Miami. The program remains in rebuild mode.\n\nPenn State fired James Franklin in October. That move opened the door for mass departures in January. A total of 46 players left the program. New coach Matt Campbell kept linebacker Tony Rojas and cornerback Daryus Dixson. Several players followed Franklin to Virginia Tech. Twelve Penn State players transferred to Blacksburg, including quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer and tight end Luke Reynolds.\n\nIowa State saw 54 players enter the portal after Matt Campbell left for Penn State. His exit ended a long era with the Cyclones. Top players who left included Rocco Becht, Benjamin Brahmer, Marcus Neal and Jeremiah Cooper. Campbell brought 23 Iowa State players with him to Penn State. Jimmy Rogers was hired from Washington State to replace him. He added 48 new players to stop the losses. Replacing that level of talent will be difficult.\n\nOklahoma State led the nation with 64 transfer portal exits. Mike Gundy was fired three games into the 2025 season. That move opened a 30 day portal window for players. A second window in January raised the total even higher. New coach Eric Morris arrived from North Texas and rebuilt the roster fast. He added 54 new transfers. Quarterback Drew Mestemaker and running back Caleb Hawkins followed him from North Texas. Notable losses included Wendell Gregory, Jaylen Lloyd and Noah McKinney.\n\nThe transfer portal changed the direction of many programs this cycle. Coaching changes caused the largest waves of exits. Oklahoma State and Iowa State were hit the hardest. Penn State and West Virginia also saw major losses. Other teams balanced departures with strong transfer classes. How well these schools recover will shape the 2026 season.\n\nThe post Schools with highest college football transfer portal departures appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "\"I've personally gotten a lot more out of biographies than I ever have from particular business books,\" said Selkirk Sport co-founder Mike Barnes.",
    "fullText": "Mike and Rob Barnes started selling airsoft equipment out of their dad's basement when they were teenagers. It was part of a homeschool project and evolved into a profitable business.\n\nA few years later, they launched a pickleball equipment company at ages 19 and 22. They had no college degrees, no outside investors, and no guarantee that pickleball would ever take off.\n\n\"I remember there was a point where dad talked to us and said, 'OK, you can go to college, and you can go down that path, or you can keep doing what you're doing and just double down,'\" Rob told Business Insider. \"And we were like, let's double down, see what happens.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, that bet has paid off. Selkirk is now one of the leading pickleball equipment brands, known for its premium paddles, and the family-run company expects to generate nine-figure revenue in 2026.\n\nThe Barnes brothers say that while they skipped traditional higher education, learning has always been central to how they run their business. They've learned from other successful founders and executives by reading a lot of business books.\n\nThey shared six of their top recs.\n\nBoth brothers say they gravitate toward biographies and autobiographies because they show how decisions actually play out in the real world.\n\n\"I've personally gotten a lot more out of biographies than I ever have from particular business books,\" Rob said. \"You have people literally talking about how they made a decision and why, and then showing how it played out, good or bad.\"\n\nSome of their favorite autobiographies and memoirs include:\n\nOne business book the brothers said influenced them early on was \"The E-Myth\" by Michael E. Gerber, which dispels myths about starting a business.\n\nThey also recommend \"Barbarians at the Gate,\" which tells the story of RJR Nabisco's fall.\n\n\"It was interesting — more of a warning about how corporate governance can get out of hand,\" they said of Bryan Burrough and John Helyar's bestseller.\n\nFinally, one of Mike's favorites is \"The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success.\"\n\nThe book profiles eight relatively unknown CEOs who delivered extraordinary results by ignoring convention.\n\n\"They weren't very big on public perception,\" Mike said. \"But they ran their companies really well in unconventional ways. And it worked.\"\n\nThe brothers are very willing to question conventional wisdom.\n\nThey don't believe there's a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to go about business, and said they try to avoid a \"best practices\" mindset.\n\n\"In a formal education environment, you often learn there's one way of doing things — and your goal is to avoid making a mistake,\" said Mike. \"That creates a mindset where people are just trying to learn the best practice so they don't mess up. Our mindset is more like, let's look at all the different ways people have done things and decide what actually makes sense for us.\"\n\nInstead of defaulting to industry norms, they focus on \"strategic practices\" that are grounded in evidence, context, and their specific business goals.\n\n\"'Best practice' is almost a bad word in our company,\" Mike said. \"If someone says, 'Let's do this because it's the best practice,' you actually have to bring in evidence and explain why it's 'best.'\"\n\nRob added, \"No one's built a great business by doing everything exactly the same way everyone else does. Be willing to be counterintuitive and challenge the status quo.\"",

    "description": "Among other things, Hofstra wrestler Will Conlon also likes to read and lists “Catcher in the Rye” as his favorite book.  Conlon doesn’t compare himself to the 16-year-old main character, created in the 1951 classic novel by J.D.

    "fullText": "Among other things, Hofstra wrestler Will Conlon also likes to read and lists “Catcher in the Rye” as his favorite book.\n\n“I read that for my 12th-grade AP literature class,” said the 197-pound redshirt college sophomore from Hoover, Ala.\n\nConlon doesn’t compare himself to the 16-year-old main character, created in the 1951 classic novel by J.D. Salinger, who dealt with the reality of adulthood in a much grimier era in New York City.\n\nAnd of course, Hofstra is located 30 miles from the City on Long Island, where wrestlers can find a beach on the Atlantic Ocean as fast as they can find a much busier life in New York City.\n\n“It’s actually more of a suburban area and what I’m used to,” said Conlon, who grew up outside of Birmingham, and does find time to enjoy today’s New York City. “My coach probably doesn’t want me to say this, but there are times I go to the City to eat and eat too much.”\n\nBut Conlon, a 2023 Alabama state high school champion, does believe “100 percent” that the book’s message is helping him adapt to NCAA Division I wrestling.\n\n“(The book) had a big impact on me,” he said. “I’m due to go back through that book because there are many lessons to have been learned from it.”\n\nConlon simply calls his college wrestling career “challenging.” That included a true freshman season in 2023-24 when he went 9-15 at 184 pounds and a redshirt year last season that saw him beat two eventual national qualifiers before undergoing surgery in March to repair an ACL injury.\n\nHe returned this season much healthier and has compiled a 14-9 record through Feb. 1. Though he is not ranked, Conlon considers himself and other Hofstra teammates — like fellow redshirt sophomore Jake Slotnick, 16-11 at 165 pounds — as diamonds in the rough.\n\n“In high school and middle school when I started wrestling, I’ve felt like I’ve been looked over at times,” said Conlon, who also won an NHSCA national championship before coming to Hofstra.\n\n“For me, it’s about chipping away against the top guys in my weight class and trying to close the gap. Consistency is what’s going to get me there. The biggest aspect of my training since high school is where I’ve made myself consistent with training and doing what it takes to get better.\n\n“I’m really thankful for the coaching staff that I have now and who took a chance on me.”\n\nHofstra coach Jamie Franco, the former Pride alum who was a three-time NCAA qualifier (2012-14), believes Hofstra can return to the days when the EIWA school finished as high as seventh in the nation in 2007, but has not had an All-American since 2018 when heavyweight Michael Hughes finished sixth.\n\n“We are a young team,” said Franco, now in his second year. “We just need some experience. Fortunately, most of this team has one or two years of eligibility left.”\n\nFranco — who was introduced to the Alabama native from Conlon’s club coach, Shad Rissler, also a New York native and former prep teammate of Franco —believes that Conlon can be one of his team’s leaders.\n\n“I think he’s a better version of himself and we see each week he’s getting a little stronger,” said Franco. “We hope over the next month before the conference tournament that he keeps building and realizes how well he is doing.”\n\nWill, the son of Carol and Joshua (a former high school wrestler) Conlon, has tried to share his challenge with friends and family back home in Alabama.\n\n“I tell them what’s going on, but if I wasn’t myself, I don’t think I’d truly understand what this has been all about,” he admitted. “It’s a different beast. You have to wake up early, go to workouts and team practices and classes and then go through the competition aspect of it. Every time you compete, a guy is looking to rip your head off, and you have to be willing to do the same thing.”\n\nConlon also credits the Hofstra brotherhood in helping me adapt to his college environment and wrestling goals.\n\n“I just moved off campus this past semester into a house with six other guys and teammates. I consider all those guys my brothers,” he said. “That’s what was important for me when I came here on my visit. I felt like I was home with my family. The summer before my freshman year, I came into training with a team and felt connected with that group.”\n\nBut Conlon also believes he must take his own responsibility to reach his wrestling goals.\n\n“There is something I learned since being in college: you have to seek out the answers to what your development is going to look like and how you are going to get to the next level,” he said. “At this level, you can’t just come in and work on your two best shots of two best re-attacks, work on top and bottom and simply achieve what you want to achieve.\n\n“I feel like you have to be a fan of the sport and be watching the guys who are constantly innovating in the sport and adopting some of those habits and training methods of the best wrestlers. I think some guys don’t realize they also have to be innovators and be as much of a spectator as a competitor.”\n\nA management major, who has been on Hofstra’s Dean List in the past two years, does believe he is reaching his overall life’s goals the past three years.\n\n“Before wrestling was in the cards, which happened late in my high school career, I was thinking about going to a state school near me like Auburn or Alabama,” he said. “And while that experience might have been good, I think taking a different step and direction to wrestle in college and in a completely unknown area, it’s definitely something that aligns with my goals, which is trying out next experiences that make up my life.”",

    "description": "Penn State now has an incoming freshman class of 15 recruits, and most of them originally signed with Iowa State before following Campbell to his new school.",
    "fullText": "College football’s February signing period is pretty much an afterthought for most schools nowadays, but it meant plenty to new Penn State coach Matt Campbell.\n\nPenn State signed only two high school recruits during the December signing period because the Nittany Lions hadn’t yet hired Campbell away from Iowa State. That left Campbell quite busy trying to put together a freshman class while also working the transfer portal and hiring his staff.\n\n“The last two months has been a whirlwind in a multitude of different ways,” Campbell said Wednesday.\n\nPenn State now has an incoming freshman class of 15 recruits, and most of them originally signed with Iowa State before following Campbell to his new school. Most of the high school seniors who initially had committed to Penn State landed at Virginia Tech in December after James Franklin was fired as the Nittany Lions’ coach and got hired by the Hokies.\n\nAlthough Penn State’s class still ranks in the bottom third of the Big Ten, according to composite rankings of recruiting sites compiled by 247Sports, it looks much greater than it did a couple of months ago. Penn State also had added over three dozen transfers, with the majority of them also coming over from Iowa State.\n\nOne of the top former Iowa State recruits to end up at Penn State is edge rusher Elijah Reeder. He can team up with December signee Jackson Ford to give the Nittany Lions a pair of promising pass-rushing prospects.“Big, powerful, strong kid,” said Tom Loy, a national recruiting analyst for 247Sports. “Just want to continue to see him keep his motor up, keep the weight down, but he’s a guy Nebraska’s very excited about.”\n\nNotre Dame also made some news Wednesday by signing quarterback Teddy Jarrard, who had been a 2027 prospect before reclassifying. The move enabled Jarrard to sign with Notre Dame on Wednesday and begin his college career this fall.\n\nJarrard will have a chance to compete for the right to serve as the main backup to returning starter CJ Carr. Kenny Minchey, who backed up Carr this past season, has transferred to Kentucky.\n\nMinchey’s exit leaves Carr, Jarrard, incoming freshman Noah Grubbs and Blake Hebert as Notre Dame’s only scholarship quarterbacks. Hebert didn’t play as a true freshman this past season.\n\n“You look at the size, the frame, the mechanics, there’s a lot to like about Teddy Jarrard,” Loy said. “I think he’s the most likely next-up option after CJ Carr.”\n\nPenn State was an anomaly in signing most of its incoming freshman class in February rather than December. Virtually all the major college prospects now finalize their college plans in December as the February signing date has faded in relevance.\n\nOne notable player who remained uncommitted heading into the February signing period was edge rusher Dylan Berymon, who announced he will play for Nebraska. Berymon is the nation’s No. 223 prospect in his class, according to the 247Sports Composite.",

The Wolverines hadn't won at the Breslin Center in years and had lost four straight to the rival Spartans.\n\nHowever, on Friday, not only did Michigan go into enemy territory and beat MSU, it did so convincingly in the end. But it wasn't without drama.\n\nThe Wolverines took a 16-point lead into the locker room at halftime, only to see much of that lead evaporate minutes into the second half.

    "fullText": "Michigan football went 9-4 in 2025 despite having a lot going on behind the scenes. The hope with new head coach Kyle Whittingham leading the charge is that the Wolverines won't just rebound, they'll thrive.\n\nBut given the schedule, it will be something of an uphill battle for the maize and blue.\n\nMichigan will play Ohio State, Oregon, Indiana, Penn State, Iowa, Oklahoma, and more in 2026, with the first two matchups mentioned being on the road. Even so, CBS Sports' Brad Crawford (who usually isn't effusive in praise for the maize and blue) is optimistic about Whittingham's first year in Ann Arbor.\n\nIn Crawford's too-early CFP 12-team projection, the Wolverines make the cut as the 10-seed, meaning that they would be 12th overall and face Texas Tech, with the winner of the game set to face Indiana.\n\nAn early season win over Oklahoma win come in clutch for first-year Michigan coach Kyle Whittingham, who has more assets with the Wolverines than he ever possessed at Utah. Whittingham often gets the most out of his roster, and with enhanced resources, he should quickly push Michigan back in the playoff conversation. In this scenario as the 10-seed, the Wolverines would become the playoff's second-ever three-loss team, but first to not reach their league title game to get in. The losses? Oregon, Indiana and Ohio State.\n\nHaving three losses in the 2026 season wouldn't be a surprise given the perceived strength of schedule. However, making it into the 12-team invitational without losing that third game in the Big Ten Championship Game would be a bit of a surprise, given that no one has made it in with a 9-3 record before.\n\nCould that equate to a successful season? Making the playoff but with losses to Ohio State, Oregon, and Indiana? Perhaps, but most likely not in Michigan fans' eyes. Even if the schedule is more daunting this year than last.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: CBS Sports projects Michigan football to 2026 College Football Playoff",

    "description": "Two years ago, I started taking ballet classes. The studio is a much-needed third place for me to escape from stress, meet new people, and learn.",
    "fullText": "Two years ago, I found myself sitting in my car outside a dance studio for my first ballet class. I laughed a little as I texted a friend that I was nervous to go inside.\n\nI was 23, and my last experience with any sort of dance had been many years prior. I also had no natural musicality.\n\nThough I'd always been captivated by dancers and enchanted by the natural work ethic of prima ballerinas, what really inspired me to get out of my comfort zone was the desire for a \"third place.\"\n\nThe term, coined by sociologists, refers to a social setting beyond work and home. As a recent college graduate who'd been feeling stuck in my daily work-from-home routine and missing my long-distance friends, finding a place where I could build a community and escape life's stresses felt especially relevant.\n\nLittle did I know that years later I'd still be returning to ballet classes week after week.\n\nNot only have I learned the right way to point my foot, but I've also learned some valuable lessons that I carry far beyond the studio.\n\nWalking into the studio for my first class, I wasn't thinking I'd end up en pointe by the end of the week, but I hoped I'd enjoy it, make new friends, and learn something new.\n\nI stumbled a bit through the routines, but luckily, the instructor was careful to go slowly and show why each movement needed to be deliberate and graceful.\n\nIt was comforting to look at the other students and share a look of confusion, and a few classes later, it was nice to feel the same pride when we nailed a combination.\n\nWith so many of my friends a long plane ride away, it's been refreshing to have a local group of people with whom I can surround myself and learn something new.\n\nI know the rough sketches of what's going on in my fellow students' lives and the personalities of each teacher, and although I may not see everyone outside the studio, there's a reliable rhythm to knowing what my Wednesday nights will look like.\n\nThe studio owner and I have known each other for over two years now, and she's seen me progress into someone who actually understands the ballet commands she relays in French. We have a regular rapport, and she knows when my birthday is.\n\nHere, my peers see me in a different light than my friends and colleagues do, in my pale pink ballet slippers with my hair tied back, finally mastering bending my elbow just so.\n\nGrowing up, dance was a skill I admired, but not something I ever saw myself doing. I didn't feel confident enough to perform alongside others who might be more naturally talented.\n\nInstead, I gravitated toward playing tennis and writing — skills I felt more confident in, and still do today — but as I got older, I realized I could still choose to do ballet.\n\nOf course, I don't want to make a fool of myself, but as an adult ballerina, I have no vision of becoming a principal dancer in the New York City Ballet. Knowing that has been incredibly freeing as I laugh my way through grand battements and look at myself in the mirror during rond de jambes.\n\nThough I'm not perfect at it, I have fun and find myself learning and growing each and every class. Plus, I also have the opportunity to join in performances, which I hope to do for the first time this year.\n\nI appreciate that ballet has given me a place to learn and make mistakes without professional or personal consequences.\n\nEvery time I enter the studio, I know I'm doing something for both my younger self and who I am now, and that means the world to me.",

    "fullText": "Perfect Tides perfectly captures the older millennial college experience, and a time when nobody worried about being embarrassing online\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nI’ve noticed an interesting micro-trend emerging in the last few years: millennial nostalgia games. Not just ones that adopt the aesthetic of Y2K gaming – think Crow Country or Fear the Spotlight’s deliberately retro PS1-style fuzzy polygons – but semi-autobiographical games specifically about the millennial experience. I’ve played three in the past year. Despelote is set in 2002 in Ecuador and is played through the eyes of a football-obsessed eight-year-old. The award-winning Consume Me is about being a teen girl battling disordered eating in the 00s. And this week I played a point-and-click adventure game about being a college student in the early 2000s.\n\nPerfect Tides: Station to Station is set in New York in 2003 – a year that is the epitome of nostalgia for the micro-generation that grew up without the internet but came of age online. It was before Facebook, before the smartphone, but firmly during the era of late-night forum browsing and instant-messenger conversations. The internet wasn’t yet a vector for mass communication, but it could still bring you together with other people who loved the things that you loved, people who read the same hipster blogs and liked the same bands. The protagonist, Mara, is a student and young writer who works in her college library.\n\nThe earnestness with which Perfect Tides presents the college experience – quoting full paragraphs from pretentious texts, awkward interactions with classmates, stilted phone calls with Mara’s boyfriend back home – predates the concept of cringe. A key difference between the millennial generation and that of gen Z is that millennials did not grow up curating an online image on social media, and therefore had a much lesser terror of being perceived. We’d put up entire albums of terrible, blurry photos from a single night out, write nonstop on LiveJournal, produce appalling juvenilia and then post it on fanfic or art forums.\n\nNaturally, we find this embarrassing now, as do the younger generation, who enjoy making fun of millennial cringe. But Perfect Tides takes place in a time where nobody was worried about being embarrassing online or, indeed, in person. It’s a time before “hipster” emerged as an insult. Mara inhales everything around her – an anarchist philosophy book, music and movies, everything she hears professors say in class, new relationships – and reading, talking to other characters, and writing essays deepens her understanding of these topics, opening up new avenues of conversation in turn. It’s a cute way of gamifying the process of expanding your intellectual and taste horizons. She’s at an age where every experience and idea is new.\n\nPerfect Tides shares an aesthetic with Consume Me. Each embrace the sometimes messy pixel-art of 90s computer adventure games – but Consume Me’s tone is comedic and satirical where Perfect Tides’ is earnest. Both, however, are part of a long tradition of coming-of-age stories that emerge from every generation that has had the luxury of education and a free-form young adulthood. “Emerging adulthood”, a phrase coined by psychologist Jeffrey Arnett in 2000, is a useful descriptor for this stage of life: the extended period of identity formation, distinct from adolescence, that usually happens between 18 and 29 in societies where it is economically possible and culturally permissible for young adults to pursue further education.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is an especially redolent and memorable period of life, which is why there are so very many novels, films and TV shows about young adulthood. Playing Perfect Tides reminded me of Douglas Coupland’s youth-memoir novel, Generation X, which was part of the cultural canon when I was a teenager. And it makes sense that the first generation to truly grow up with games – my generation – is now making sense of those experiences through creating games. The bildungsroman of the 1800s has become the autobiographical indie game of the 2020s.\n\nIt is the very specificity of Perfect Tides – the year, the setting, Mara herself – that makes it feel so human and personal. You don’t have to be part of a specific generation to appreciate that generation’s art: when I read autofiction set in the 1960s or the 80s, I learn something about what it felt like to be alive in that time. When I play these millennial autofiction games, I relate to them more closely – there are aspects of Mara’s young-adulthood experience that closely mirror my own – but I’m still learning something. By spending a little time in these fictionalised memories, I’m learning how someone else experienced those same formative years.\n\nLook, I just can’t face another capitalist-dystopia piece of media at the moment. So I’m going to have to save Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator for a little later in the year, when I’m feeling more resilient. In this strategy-game-meets-stock-market simulator, you bet your credits on the life outcomes of fictional alien babies, watching their lives play out in text alerts. This anticapitalist satirical offering is from the people at Strange Scaffold, a studio that has now made a profitable habit of turning tweet-length jokes into full games (see also Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion and An Airport for Aliens Run By Dogs).\n\nAvailable on: PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 1-3 hours\n\nSony has patented the idea of personalised AI podcasts hosted by characters from its games. I am equal parts horrified and darkly amused by the thought of PaRappa the Rapper reading out patch notes.\n\nUK game retailer GAME has died yet another death, reports the Game Business, having struggled since the early 2010s. Its last three shops will close, and most of its other operations have already wound down. It will continue to exist within Sports Direct and House of Fraser stores.\n\nI’m still not done thinking about Hollow Knight Silksong, so I enjoyed this article by Nicole Clark, on the new feminist games website Mothership, about the game’s unexpected compassion.\n\nBloomberg visited Obsidian – one of Microsoft’s most interesting developers – for this studio profile, in which its leaders talk about how they ended up releasing three games in 2025.\n\nAnd finally: my book about Nintendo is finally out this week in the US, and next week in the UK. I’m doing a bunch of launch events in Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews, London and Brighton. I’d love to see you there – tickets are here.\n\nThere’s a reason that Wii Bowling remains my mum’s favourite game of all time | Dominik Diamond\n\nCairn – obsession, suffering and awe in a climbing game that hits exhausting new heights | ★★★★☆\n\nIron Lung – YouTuber Markiplier crash lands with big-screen sci-fi horror | ★★☆☆☆\n\nThis week’s question comes from reader Gavin:\n\n“Could you explain the current debate around physical game ownership v digital? And the grey area of buying a digital code in a physical box? I can’t imagine those codes will be collector’s items in 10 years’ time ...”\n\nOnce upon a time, all video games came on cassette tapes, discs or cartridges, usually in tragically damage-prone cardboard boxes, with paper manuals. Then, when digital downloads became practical, we had a choice: either you buy your game on a disc in a box, or you go for the convenience of a downloaded version that exists on your hard drive. Now, however, it is difficult or even impossible to buy many games in a physical format. And even when you do, the disc simply prompts a 50GB download, or the box contains nothing but a redeemable code.\n\nDigital downloads are preferable for the businesses that run the gaming industry, for two reasons. Firstly: there are no manufacturing, packaging and shipping costs. Secondly: Sony, Apple, Steam, Microsoft or Nintendo gets around a 30% cut of every game sold digitally on their platforms, which is essentially free money for them. At one point, game retailers had too much power for these platform holders to abandon physical games: too many copies of FIFA and COD were sold at branches of GAME. But now, with bricks-and-mortar game retail a vanishing business, digital downloads are the norm.\n\nDigital downloads are convenient for players, of course, but they also come with huge disadvantages. What you’re buying is a licence, which at some theoretical future point could expire or become unusable, rendering your games unplayable. You can’t sell on a digital code or transfer ownership. For this reason a lot of people still prefer physical media, of all kinds. And everybody hates code-in-a-box. It’s the worst of both worlds.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "fullText": "There is a common angst among college football fans with the College Football Playoff, the length of the grind and for teams like Notre Dame, they’ve had to adjust much of what they do to get to the end.\n\nLast season, the Irish and Ohio State, and this year with Indiana and Miami, saw their seasons conclude almost two months after the regular season ended. The hope was that the CFP committee would make some adjustments to the schedule, but as we found out on Tuesday, that won’t be the case.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the quarterfinal games for 2026 will be played on Dec. 30th and Jan. 1st, and then just over two weeks later the semifinals will be played. The scheduled is very similar for the 2027 season as well, and it just doesn’t feel like college football.\n\nAs Josh Pate pointed out, Saturday, Nov. 14th is the midpoint of the “season” which is crazy to think about. There is no need for such a large gap, and I personally hate that these games aren’t played on Saturday’s. Sure, contending with the NFL isn’t a great idea, but college football has plenty of history playing on Saturday’s. The long layoffs are unnecessary as well, as players are accustomed to just a week to prepare for the next game.\n\nHopefully some changes will be made going forward, but for at least the next two seasons, the CFP schedule will be long and drawn out.\n\nUpcoming College Football Playoff dates for the quarterfinals and semi-finals the next two years.

    "fullText": "The way of the college football world today breaks down to this: coaches don’t get many opportunities to screw up, and anything short of a national championship is considered a screw up. So, given that current logic, it’s no surprise that the Houston Chronicle recently published a column noting that Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian sits atop a steadily warming hot-ish seat after the Longhorns missed the College Football Playoff last season.\n\nFrom the Chronicle: “Steve Sarkisian is not on any hot seat by a long shot. Not after going 35-8 the past three years (with two of the losses in the College Football Playoff semifinals and three other losses to Georgia and, oh yeah, Florida). He reached the CFP two of the previous three seasons and barely missed this past season. But he’s on the warming seat. And he’s got company. Sarkisian is preparing for his sixth season at Texas after seeing 26 of his players transfer out and 19 transfer in, including the portal’s top-ranked wide receiver, two outstanding running backs and two elite linebackers. The big number of those leaving suggest Texas badly missed its evaluations on more than two dozen players or drastically upgraded all of those positions. Actually, both of those premises could be true. Sarkisian at least grasps the sense of urgency among Longhorn Nation because this isn’t a place where you want to miss the playoff two years in a row. But he’s not alone. I’d say the top five coaches with the most heat on them, in order, are Alabama’s Kalen DeBoer, Oregon’s Dan Lanning, Sarkisian, LSU’s Lane Kiffin and USC’s Lincoln Riley. None of these obviously are in a must-win situation like some others. … Those on the hottest of hot seats are Baylor’s Dave Aranda (three losing seasons in the past four years), Florida State’s Mike Norvell (coming off 2-10 and 5-7 seasons), Wisconsin’s Luke Fickell (16-21 over three years), Maryland’s Mike Locksley (1-8 in Big Ten two straight years) and South Carolina’s Shane “Did you see our first half against the Aggies?” Beamer. … Of the group needing to break through and avoid slipping backward, they just need to win big and dispel the notion that they have hit a wall and have to get past it. DeBoer, it says here, is the best coach in the nation not named Kirby Smart, Curt Cignetti or Ryan Day, yet a large percentage of Crimson Tide fans think his days might be numbered if a third year isn’t more successful after missing the CFP in Year 1 and winning one CFP game over an average Oklahoma team in Year 2. Lanning has been a borderline disaster in the CFP, getting squashed by Ohio State in 2024 and mauled by Indiana in 2025 (after dominating Texas Tech). Kiffin may or may not have a honeymoon in his first season at Baton Rouge, but he’s still not been on the sidelines for a CFP game yet in his career. Riley can sure develop a quarterback or two with Caleb Williams and Jayden Maiava, but when is the breakthrough season coming?

    "fullText": "It’s pretty safe the say that the general sentiment around college football is that Notre Dame will make its return to the College Football Playoff in 2026.\n\nThe Irish were left out of this year’s 12-team event, as many believed that they deserved to be in. After what we saw unfold, it was pretty safe to say that Notre Dame should have been in, as it very well could have won it all.\n\nAs for this coming season, CBS Sports Brad Crawford released his way-too-early CFP bracket projection, and he’s got the Irish as the No. 2 seed. Miami, one of Notre Dame’s opponents, takes the to spot, so it seems like whoever loses that game finds their footing once again. Texas and Indiana round out his top-4.\n\nIn this scenario, the Irish would take on the winner of the 7 vs. 10 matchup as Crawford has Texas A&M and Oregon battling it out in the first round. Overall, it’s an interesting take, with four Big Ten and SEC teams, Texas Tech making it again and Memphis as the Group of 5 team.\n\nIt will be interesting to come back to this when the regular season is over, but it doesn’t seem like the worst field considering which teams are participating.\n\nWay-Too-Early College Football Playoff projection for the 2026 season, via @BCrawford247 👀\n\nWhat would you change?\n\n🔗 https://t.co/QnshRG871e pic.twitter.com/Dlc3J28sIW\n\n— CBS Sports College Football 🏈 (@CBSSportsCFB) February 3, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: What seed is Notre Dame in CBS Sports early 2026 CFP projection?",

    "description": "When the SEC’s membership voted to add a ninth conference game, you must wonder whether they thought a 16-team playoff would be in place in 2026.",
    "fullText": "When the SEC’s membership voted to add a ninth conference game, you must wonder whether they thought a 16-team playoff would be in place by the time the expanded conference schedule went into effect.\n\nYou also must wonder whether those SEC members still would’ve voted to expand the conference schedule, if they’d known the 12-team playoff would endure for the 2026 season.\n\nOn this edition of “SEC Football Unfiltered,” a podcast from the USA TODAY Network, hosts Blake Toppmeyer and John Adams unpack the SEC’s inability to strike a compromise with the Big Ten to reach on playoff expansion — and why the nine-game conference schedule might work to the SEC’s detriment in 2026.\n\nThey also debate whether the SEC should have gotten on board with the Big Ten’s plan for a 24-team playoff.\n\nAdams: I’ve long advocated for the SEC expanding its conference schedule to create a better product. However, I’m skeptical that the extra conference game will help the SEC’s playoff pursuits in 2026. You must ask: How much will the selection committee reward strength of schedule? Answer: Probably not as much as the SEC desires.\n\nA nine-game SEC schedule would have paired neatly with a 16-team playoff. SEC teams that finished 9-3 would’ve been prime candidates for at-large selection, in a 16-team field.\n\nThe selection committee still places a lot of value win-loss record, and an extra conference game will make it more difficult for SEC teams to reach 10-2.\n\nToppmeyer: The SEC needed a 16-team bracket for its nine-game conference schedule to pay off. The playoff committee has never selected a 9-3 team for a spot in the 12-team playoff, consistently rejecting SEC teams that pair nine wins with a lofty strength of schedule. Will the committee suddenly start admitting 9-3 SEC teams just because the conference added another league game? I’m skeptical of that.\n\nKudos to the Big Ten’s maneuvering. It argued for the SEC to add a ninth conference game, then threw up a roadblock toward expanding to a 5+11 playoff bracket that the SEC, Big 12 and ACC favored.\n\nWithout Big Ten support, the 5+11 playoff idea could not get approved. So, the SEC strengthened its schedule without successfully creating any more playoff bids. A 12-team playoff that’s worked well for the Big Ten persists.\n\nUnlike the SEC, the Big Ten does not require its members to play either a Power Four opponent or Notre Dame in the non-conference schedule, although many do.\n\nOverall, the Big Ten played the SEC like a fiddle.\n\nAdams: No. This combination of a nine-game SEC schedule with a 12-team playoff might not work to the SEC’s benefit, but that’s not enough reason to get lured into a 24-team playoff. A playoff of such size would turn the sport on its head and devalue the regular season.\n\nWhen we’re talking about almost the entire US LBM Coaches Poll Top 25 making the playoff, it's gotten too big.\n\nToppmeyer: No. If the SEC wants 16, then continue negotiating to try to bring that into effect in subsequent years.\n\nCommitting to 24, when three of the four power conferences want 16, just wouldn’t make sense. College football’s regular season is its greatest attribute. I’m skeptical of any playoff format that would dilute the regular season. The Big Team’s 24-team proposal would do that.\n\nBlake Toppmeyer is the USA TODAY Network's national college football columnist. John Adams is the senior sports columnist for the Knoxville News Sentinel. \n\nIf you purchase through our links, the USA Today Network may earn a commission.

    "fullText": "Allen Wang and Eric Liu, two UC Berkeley dropouts, think they can help college students find love using AI.\n\nTheir dating startup, Ditto, leverages AI to match people based on the data users input into the service. It then plans the date for them.\n\n\"We're bringing people back to in-real-life interactions,\" Wang, 23, told Business Insider.\n\nAfter users make a profile, they directly message Ditto's AI chatbot via text— no app required — about their type and dating preferences. On Wednesdays, users get a text about a potential match. After each date, Ditto follows up for feedback and uses that information as additional data for future matches.\n\n\"People are tired of being trapped behind the apps,\" Wang said.\n\nDitto will announce on Tuesday that it has raised $9.2 million in seed funding, led by venture capital firm Peak XV, with participation from firms like Alumni Ventures, Gradient, and Scribble Ventures.\n\nThe seed funding will primarily be spent on hiring talent across AI and growth, Wang said, as well as toward Ditto's marketing. The company has 10 staffers and has raised a total of $9.5 million to date. Ditto launched its product in early 2025.\n\nDitto isn't the only AI dating app gaining momentum right now.\n\nOther startups like Sitch, Known, and Amata have raised millions for similar products that pitch AI-powered matchmaking as the new alternative to swiping through profiles. Dating app mainstays like Tinder and Bumble, meanwhile, are also testing the AI waters to reignite user interest.\n\nDitto's AI tries to determine whether two people would be a good match by using profile details, such as users' hobbies or interests, to simulate a date, Wang said.\n\n\"Would you guys have a good conversation? Do you guys have matched humor level? Do you guys have similar vibes and values?\" Wang said.\n\nThe dating startup world has a history of targeting college students as early users.

    "fullText": "To this point in the season, we haven’t had a ton of major upsets among the top teams in the country. In fact, the top 10 teams in the AP poll have a combined 16 losses, an average of 1.6 per team. That means one of two things – either the teams at the top of the sport have really separated themselves from the rest of the nation, or they’re due for some regression! Let’s see what happens over the next month and a half!\n\nThe Wolfpack have really hit their stride as of late, running their offense behind a pick-and-roll and pick-and-pop scheme with Quadir Copeland handling the ball, Derrion Williams setting the screen, and Paul McNeil and Tre Hollomon spacing the floor. It’s fun to watch, and I don’t think that SMU is going to have any answers for it, lacking the personnel to switch on the screen.\n\nMORE: ESPN, NFL finalize billion-dollar media deal after government approval\n\nThe year is 2026, and the Blue Demons finally have a home-court advantage. In Big East play, DePaul has only lost once at home, and it was to the top-of-the-conference UConn Huskies. CJ Gunn is the type of scorer who can catch fire and ignite an entire arena, and I think Tuesday is the night when DePaul is officially back on the map.\n\nCross-country road trips have meant doom in the Big Ten this season. Here we have Iowa traveling to the Pacific Northwest to take on a healthy and rejuvenated Washington team with Wesley Yates and Jacob Ognacevic back. Plus, the stylings of Ben McCollum generally lead to low-possession games where upsets are more likely.\n\nThe Redhawks are still unbeaten heading into February, but they are starting to show some cracks. On Saturday, they trailed Northern Illinois by double-digits before coming back to win. In the first meeting between these two teams, Miami needed overtime and then a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to come out victorious on their home floor. Now the game is in Buffalo, and the Bulls are hungry for revenge.\n\nWinning in the Fertitta Center is never easy, but if Johnny Dawkins’ squad is good enough to beat Texas Tech, they can take down Houston, too. Stylistically, I think this is a good matchup for UCF. Houston loves to blitz and trap ball screens, and UCF has smart ball-handlers who should be able to handle the pressure and make good decisions. I think it’s quite likely that UCF’s forwards can get Houston into foul trouble.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo’s mom hints at next NBA team\n\nMLB: Mets sign former Dodgers World Series champion\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Mattress Mack reveals massive $2 million Super Bowl 60 wager\n\nENTERTAINMENT: WWE star calls Pat McAfee to reveal shocking 2026 Royal Rumble return\n\nVIRAL: Kendall Jenner halts interview for Tom Brady Super Bowl 60 prediction on FaceTime\n\nThe post Predicting upsets in College Basketball this week  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Not only are the two teams fighting for important bragging rights, they also are near the bubble of the NCAA tournament, so it was a very important game for both squads.\n\nHarvard controlled most of the game in its opening minutes, but when Drew Fortescue slotted in a goal just 3 minutes in, things were already leaning BC’s way. The Eagles started to take over more of the possession time as the first period progressed, and quickly culminating with two goals by James Hagens to extend BC’s lead to 3-0 only 15 minutes of game time after the opening faceoff.\n\nIn the second period, it was Harvard that made quick work of things. They scored in under 30 seconds to start the second period to steal back some momentum. But the Crimson train did not keep rolling, and the rest of the second period was dominated by the Eagles, who outshot their opponent 20-1 for the remainder of that period. Dean Letourneau tipped in a laser shot by James Hagens to bring BC’s lead back out to 4-1 with just 20 seconds remaining, which once again gave BC all of the momentum heading into the intermission.\n\nThe third period was mostly a formality, even as Harvard pressured with an empty net. They couldn’t get more than just a few shots on net, and eventually Lukas Gustafsson completely ended their night with a corner snipe in the final minutes. Boston College came away with the 5-1 victory to advance to the Beanpot’s final round against either Boston University or Northeastern on Monday February 9th",

    "fullText": "The 2026 college football recruiting cycle will officially end Wednesday, but the 2027 crop is already off to a roaring start with a half-dozen five-star recruits already committed.\n\nThe latest, No. 1 running back Kemon Spell, chose Georgia over Penn State, Notre Dame and dozens of other offers on Monday. The former Nittany Lions commit is pledge No. 6 in this cycle for Kirby Smart and Co. and gives the Bulldogs a huge piece to build around — both on the trail and on the field in upcoming years.\n\nWith Spell now committed, six of the nation’s five-star prospects are already off the board in the 2027 cycle. All six are top-15 prospects nationally, with three ranking as the top player at their positions.\n\nBelow is a look at the six committed five-stars in the 2027 cycle, as of Feb. 2:\n\nSchool: McKeesport (McKeesport, PA)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 3 NATL. (No. 1 RB)\n\nScouting Summary: All-encompassing running back that can win with power and elusiveness on inside and outside runs. 5-foot-9, 200-plus pounds with tremendous twitch and leg drive. Plays with low pad level and an excellent center of gravity in order to deliver blows and take them himself. Has breakaway speed in order to hit the homerun. Ran sub-11 in the 100m during his sophomore track season. Shows the ability to catch the ball away from his frame as a pass catcher. Has all the physical and athletic tools to make an immediate impact at the next level and beyond. Younger prospect for the cycle.”\n\nSchool: Cedar Hill (Texas)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 6 NATL. (No. 1 DL)\n\nScouting Summary: “Uber-athletic defensive line prospect with true game-wrecking ability. Measured in at around 6-foot-3, 300 pounds prior to his junior season. Tests as an elite athlete in the combine setting, easily cracking 5.0 seconds in the 40-yard dash. Carries that athleticism over to the field where he has flashes of dominance on Friday nights. Lines up all over the defensive line for Cedar Hill (Texas) while facing top competition. Dangerous pass rusher from any spot. Combines explosive get-off with the movement skills of a much smaller player, carrying elite testing numbers directly onto the field. Consistently collapses pockets and disrupts plays before they develop.\n\n…Has legitimate game-wrecking moments on film. The quickness to dart into the backfield and the speed to hunt down ball carriers is eye-popping. May not possess premier length. Father was a third-round pick by the Dallas Cowboys. Tracking as the top defensive line prospect early on in the 2027 cycle with the upside to be an early NFL Draft pick.”\n\nSchool: Brother Martin (La.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 7 NATL. (No. 1 WR)\n\nScouting Summary: “The most dynamic pass-catcher early in the 2027 cycle and a threat to score every time he touches the ball. Measured at around 5-foot-11, 185 pounds prior to his junior season. One of the fastest top prospects in the cycle, running a scintillating 10.3-second mark in the 100 meters as a sophomore. Brings that elite speed to the gridiron—lethal on vertical routes, easily pulling away from defensive backs downfield. Tough to tackle in the open field and will take it the distance if he finds space at the second level. Shows natural shiftiness as a route-runner, giving him the ability to separate at every level. Among the more productive top wide receivers in the 2027 cycle as a junior.\n\n…Can continue improving his ability to attack catches with his arms extended, but has shown an expanded catch radius with several highlight-reel grabs. One of the youngest top prospects in the class with a late July birthday prior to his freshman season of college football. Athleticism, budding polish, and big-play ability make him one of the top overall playmakers in the cycle with the potential to develop into a first-round NFL Draft pick.”\n\nSchool: Blessed Trinity Catholic (Ga.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 10 NATL. (No. 2 EDGE)\n\nAbout: Jacobs has long been one of the most feared pass-rushers in Georgia. The UGA legacy tallied 102 total tackles in 11 games this fall and is now near 300 for his prep career. He piled up 16 sacks as a junior for BTC and has established himself as one of the premier defensive prospects in the nation, regardless of class. He chose Ohio State over Texas A&M and Miami. Jacobs is the top-ranked junior in the Peach State.\n\nSchool: Wayne (Ohio)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 12 NATL. (No. 3 WR)\n\nAbout: The five-star pass-catcher has already been committed to Ohio State for over a year. He made his pledge on Nov. 23, 2024 and has shown no signs of backing off since, even with the departure of Brian Hartline. The Buckeyes inked five-star WR Chris Henry Jr. after a long-standing commitment and they’ll now hope to do the same with Brown. He’s the top-ranked prospect in Ohio.\n\nSchool: Fort Gibson (Okla.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 13 NATL. (No. 3 OT)\n\nScouting Summary: “Hyper-athletic offensive tackle prospect with rare natural movement skills and a frame that points to immense long-term upside as one of the highest-ceiling linemen early in the 2027 cycle. Measured around 6-foot-7, 260 pounds with elite length (arms over 34 inches) and big hands prior to his junior season. Has the frame to add significant mass once in a college strength program. Lines up at right tackle for his high school, where his athletic traits immediately stand out. Moves with rare fluidity for his size and plays with surprising power through his lower half, generating torque and leverage at the point of attack. Shows balance and body control that project well to the next level. Displays loose flexibility and consistently lowers his pads to handle shorter defenders. Plays with a physical edge and looks to finish blocks through the whistle.\n\n…Further showcases his athleticism as a disruptive defensive end. Doubles as a talented basketball player on the high school and AAU circuit who can run the court and play above the rim. Will need to add considerable mass and adjust to stronger competition at the next level, which could delay early playing time. Possesses an outstanding developmental profile with the big frame, movement skills, and multi-sport coordination that give him the upside to develop into an early-round NFL Draft pick.”",

    "fullText": "The House Committee on Education and Workforce has asked the University of Utah to schedule a briefing to discuss the school’s plans to take money from a New York-based private equity firm.\n\nThe committee, which has jurisdiction over federal education policy, is examining the growing trend of schools seeking institutional partners to capitalize their athletic departments. The group is assessing whether legislative action might be needed to address concerns about the downstream impact of these deals.\n\nColorado's Dempsey Goes From House Objector to China Scholar\n\nSports Tech Mergers Double in Value in 'Landmark Year'\n\nCollege Recruiting Costs Shrink as Football Powers Adapt to Portal\n\nIn a letter sent to Utah president Taylor Randall on Monday morning, a copy of which was viewed by Sportico, the committee requested that the school share information regarding the details and motives behind its potential partnership with Otro Capital, which its trustees greenlit in December.\n\n“While recognizing the escalating costs in collegiate athletics, including revenue share obligations under the House v. NCAA settlement, NIL-related expenses and coaching salaries, the committee seeks to better understand the university’s rationale for entering into this arrangement,” committee chair Tim Walberg (R—Mich.) and Burgess Owens (R—Utah), a former NFL and University of Miami player and chairman of the subcommittee on Higher Education Workforce Development, wrote in the letter. “The information and briefing requested will assist the committee in determining whether legislative action may be necessary to protect students, schools and the integrity of college athletics.”\n\nAs conversations between schools and institutional funds have grown more public, so too have concerns from lawmakers. Last month, on the verge of the College Football Playoff title game, Reps. Michael Baumgartner (R—Wash.) and Haley Stevens (D—Mich.) wrote a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker asking him to limit the emergence of PE deals that “threaten the integrity of university governance and the quality of college sports in ways that will have disastrous consequences for athletes, students and fans.”\n\nLocal state-level lawmakers in both Utah and Washington have proposed bills that would also make it harder to execute these deals.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce’s letter to Randall requests that the university share terms of the arrangement and answer three specific questions:\n\nWhat factors and considerations led the university to pursue this partnership, and why was this approach selected over other potential financing options?\n\nWhat steps is the university taking to maintain institutional control and to protect student-athlete welfare, including compliance with Title IX under this partnership structure?\n\nHow might this partnership affect student costs, particularly with respect to mandatory student fees that subsidize the athletic department, and are any changes to the fee structure anticipated following implementation?\n\nRepresentatives for Utah and its athletic department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe University of Utah trustees voted during their December meeting to allow Randall, athletic department Mark Harlan and others to finalize a deal with Otro. While it’s unclear if that final arrangement has been signed, the structure of the deal was openly discussed. Utah is spinning the Utes’ athletics revenue streams into a for-profit entity, and plans to sell an equity stake in that business.\n\nRandall played a prominent part in the formal 110-minute pitch to the trustees, helping explain the macro reasons why Utah is seeking the money, and why Otro Capital was the right partner.\n\nFinancial specifics, however, have been sparse. The school has declined to share details on a deal that likely tops nine figures. A Sportico open records request for any term sheet between the school and Otro, filed back in September, is yet to be fulfilled following multiple university extensions.\n\nUtah is not alone in seeking institutional money to adapt to the modern economics of college sports. The Big Ten, for example, was recently on the verge of a $2.4 billion partnership with a California pension fund, but those talks are now on hold after pushback from some conference members about the 20-year revenue share commitment that came with the deal.\n\nThe Big 12 is in advanced talks on a potential $500 million deal with Collegiate Athletic Solutions (CAS), a fund backed by RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital, that would let schools take upfront money in exchange for revenue sharing on the back end. That deal, unlike the proposals involving Utah and the Big Ten, does not involve any equity changing hands.\n\nSeparately, a number of other schools, such as Kentucky and Clemson, have created similar separate commercial entities, but they are yet to take outside institutional investment. Those deals are widely considered necessary step for public schools to take on institutional money for athletics.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce, which dates back to 1867, has 21 majority members, and 16 minority members. Under House Rule X, the committee is tasked with reviewing and coordinating “laws, programs and government activities relating to domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student assistance within the jurisdiction of other committees.”\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2025?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings\n\nEverything to Know About the 2025 Emirates NBA Cup",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (DC News Now) — In their Morgan State college dorm in the mid-1990’s, Daronte Jones and Melvin Coleman stayed busy.\n\n“We did a lot of battles in Madden,” Coleman told DC News Now. “I’d be in the bed asleep it would be a Saturday and [Daronte] would walk and grab the controller and put the controller by my bed and soon I’d wake up and he’d jump back in like I don’t see him and be like, ‘oh so what you calling me out?”\n\nIn January, three decades after his Madden battles as a college football player with his roommate, and many professional and college football coaching stops, Jones has been hired as the Washington Commanders new defensive coordinator.\n\nFor Jones – it’s a homecoming. He hails from Prince George’s County, where he attended Bishop McNamara high school in Forestville, Maryland.\n\nIt’s not just his college friends and teammates who remember the Madden matchups. His good friend and teammate from Bishop McNamara Mike Jones also took part in the legendary video games matchups – though he didn’t know at the time he was facing a defensive mastermind.\n\n“He’s definitely the reason why I stopped playing Madden,” Mike said. “Cause he’s reading all your plays and this was the time when he was early in his coaching career… I’m like dude I’m playing for leisure.”\n\nDuring his college career, Daronte suffered a neck injury that kept him off the field. Coleman said Daronte would spend more time in the play calling booth during games and was earning a bigger grasp of the game. He said it showed in Madden too.\n\n“That kind of helped us being coaches and our playing careers were done,” Coleman said. “We learned how to think on the run, think quick, make adjustments quick.”\n\nYou could call Daronte’s coaching career the Daronte Jones World Tour.\n\nIt started in 2001 as a graduate assistant at Division II Lenoir-Rhyne. Coleman said Daronte conducted an interview with the school before they went on their spring break trip senior year. The following years took Jones to Nicholls State (then Division I-AA) as safeties coach, defensive coordinator jobs at high schools in Louisiana and his first return to the DMV where he served as Bowie State’s assistant head coach and defensive coordinator from 2005 to 2009.\n\nJones bounced around more after that. He was cornerbacks coach at UCLA in 2010, defensive backs coach for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League in 2011, Hawaii’s secondary coach in 2012-14 and Wisconsin’s defensive backs coach in 2015.\n\nThen, Jones made the jump to the NFL — first as the Miami Dolphins assistant defensive backs coach, then the Cincinnati Bengals cornerbacks coach, then the Minnesota Vikings defensive backs coach. After a brief stint as LSU’s defensive coordinator in 2021 where he coached star cornerback Derek Stingley Jr., Jones returned to the Vikings, where he stayed until this offseason.\n\n“For most people who think that this is a person who’s coming out of nowhere, that’s not true,” Mike Jones said. “This guy has been grinding close to over 20 years. He’s been grinding and getting information from the best minds in football.”\n\nFor Mike and Coleman, watching Daronte flourish in the football world has been meaningful, but they’ve also seen his growth as a coach.\n\n“Secondary wise, pass defense wise, everywhere he’s gone they’ve gotten better,” Coleman, who is now the safeties coach at Morgan State said. “Somebody is doing well, somebody is probably making the pro bowl. Somebody is probably making all-conference. So the proof is in the work.”\n\nSince 2023, Daronte had worked directly under Brian Flores in Minnesota. Coleman said that Daronte’s coaching influences and style comes from several different legendary coaching trees.\n\n“With him being around [Vic] Fangio, Marvin Lewis, [Mike] Zimmer, Vance Joseph and now Flores,” Coleman said. “He’s got a lot work from them. He got a lot of tape to take from them.”\n\nIn recent seasons, with Daronte serving as the team’s defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator, the Vikings’ defense has played aggressively, focusing on trying to force turnovers and blitzing at some of the highest rates in the NFL.\n\nDaronte’s high school teammate Mike Jones, who is now a counselor at Bishop McNamara says the way he played was pretty similar to how his defenses play.\n\n“He was always in the right spot… When we look at those old films when we get together, he pops on film,” Mike said. “He’s always going all out.”\n\nMike said Daronte earned the nickname “Crow” because “he made crow sounds in the backfield.”\n\n“He would make these crow sounds like he’s lurking in the secondary,” Mike said. “He would take on the biggest person on the team in practice even though he was gonna get knocked down… He’s not scared.”\n\nAccording to his friends, Daronte’s days at McNamara mean a lot to him. Several years ago, Daronte donated to the Bishop McNamara football program. His contributions provide student athletes with scholarship assistance. Daronte’s name is now etched on a plaque in the McNamara locker room, noted him as a 1996 graduate and that year’s male athlete of the year. Daronte played football, wrestling and track & field at McNamara.\n\n“He’s been able to come back and give back to the community itself in terms of the program and the school,” Bishop McNamara football head coach Greg Calhoun said. “But he’s also been able to take advantage of the opportunities to give back.”\n\nCalhoun told DC News Now that he referenced Daronte as inspiration and motivation for his players and as an example to potential recruits.\n\n“I actually just had a set of recruits come through and we just showed his locker again as we always do,” Calhoun said. “A lot of great coaches out here in the world but for him to be selected for that job and that opportunity in this community, is huge.”\n\nBishop McNamara plays in one of, if not the best high school football conferences in the country, the WCAC. The Mustangs last won a WCAC championship in 1990. Since, the conference has been dominated by blue blood programs DeMatha, Gonzaga, St. John’s and Good Counsel.\n\nBut in 2025, months before Daronte being hired by the Commanders, a few seasons into his tenure in Forestville, Calhoun helped his team take a massive step forward. The Mustangs beat their rival Gonzaga, 21-0 on October 11. Gonzaga was the eventual WCAC runners-up.\n\nThe following week, McNamara fell just short to eventual undefeated WCAC champion DeMatha, 12-7. They were one of two teams to come within five points or less of the Stags all season long. It was also DeMatha’s second lowest scoring output of the season.\n\n“We’re not always the first names mentioned in that league,” Mike said. “Now we have something that we can definitely hang our hat on in conversations… Now we have the defensive coordinator of our local team.”\n\nCalhoun believes that an esteemed alum calling plays down the road, could further fuel his players.\n\n“Just knowing that you have somebody of that magnitude at that level kind of puts that pressure on you obviously as the current student in that process, just letting you know you have some big shoes to fill,” Calhoun told DC News Now. “You have some expectations, you have some standards and that’s something that we work to build here in this process and our guys take pride and value in that.”\n\nAnd while Daronte rises in the football coaching ranks, he’s still a boy from Prince George’s County, Maryland.\n\n“I know growing up, everybody was like DC, DC, DC, but now it’s like PG County,” Coleman said. “We’ve got players, we’ve got ballers, we’ve got good thinkers and I think it’s just you’re proud to represent where you’re from.”\n\nAs for what Commanders fans should expects going forward, Coleman said Daronte is “a guy that’s going to be on a mission to be great. To not lose.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIllinois Fighting Illini men's basketball coach Brad Underwood saw his team overcome road adversity once again, as it snagged a critical road win Sunday afternoon to extend its winning streak to 11 by overcoming a talented No.5-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers team, 78-69.\n\nIt wasn't just any win. It's a microcosm of a season marked by raw, elite talent finally gelling together as the season's critical stretch run really gets going. Sunday at Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln was no different, as for the second consecutive weekend, the No.9-ranked Illini took down an AP Top 5 road opponent after doing the same against the Purdue Boilermakers in West Lafayette last Saturday.\n\nIt's the first time the Illini have done so in program history, but it came with a bit of extra motivation that has since begun to circulate in the hours after the revenge win.\n\nMore specifically, the team's whiteboard. There weren't X's and O's, nor was there a diagram explaining the ways Illinois can continue to remain atop a crowded Big Ten title race with a little over a month left in the season.\n\nInstead, it was four simple words: \"Rob the [expletive] bank.\"\n\nWhether it was a jab at the arena's name or otherwise, it certainly seemed to fire up Illinois as it now holds a win against every conference opponent it's played so far.\n\nUnderwood said his players were relaxed and composed in the second half after overcoming a 39-33 halftime deficit. The Illini outscored the Cornhuskers 45-30 in the final 20 minutes, as freshman guard Keaton Wagler finished with 28 points.\n\n“Chemistry and connectivity,\" Underwood told reporters. \"Just the communication… We’ve made huge strides there and we’re competing on every play,” Underwood said.\n\nMORE: Dusty May set the tone before tipoff and Michigan followed\n\nThe Illini are going to attempt to keep their winning streak alive Wednesday night from State Farm Center in Champaign, hosting the Northwestern Wildcats. Unlike Illinois, Northwestern has struggled to stay above .500 for much of the season and is trying to bounce back after dropping a 76-62 game to the Washington Huskies Saturday night.\n\nTip is set for 8 p.m. ET on Big Ten Network as the Illini try to sweep the season series.\n\nHubert Davis buyout, contract details as UNC Tar Heels coach\n\n'Basketball Saved My Life': Why Master P came home to rebuild New Orleans\n\nPenny Hardaway buyout, contract details as Memphis Tigers coach\n\nWhy FOX blocked St. John’s from participating in a major college basketball event",

    "fullText": "Emily Beutner, the daughter of Los Angeles mayoral candidate Austin Beutner, died on Jan. 6\n\nThe 22-year-old college student died at the hospital after she was found seemingly “suffering a medical emergency” by a highway in Palmdale, Calif.\n\n“My family has experienced the unimaginable loss of our beloved daughter,” the mayoral candidate said\n\nThe 22-year-old daughter of Los Angeles mayoral candidate Austin Beutner has died after seemingly experiencing a medical emergency. Her death is being investigated as a homicide.\n\nEmily Beutner died on Jan. 6 after she was spotted seemingly “suffering a medical emergency” on the side of the highway in Palmdale, Calif., shortly after 12 a.m. local time, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) said in a press release obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nA witness in the area — the intersection of Sierra Highway and Technology Drive — had alerted authorities to a woman in a “state of medical distress,” Lt. Michael Modica told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe politician’s daughter was treated at the scene and transported to a hospital, where she was later pronounced dead, according to the LASD.\n\nLASD homicide investigators “responded and assumed control of the death investigation,” the sheriff’s department said. Speaking with the Times, however, Modica warned that this should not be taken as an indication of Emily’s cause of death, as this is typical for a young person found dead in a situation like this one.\n\nAs of Feb. 1, the cause of death has not yet been determined, with Emily’s case remaining open, according to Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office records viewed by PEOPLE.\n\nAustin shared a statement with the Times in the wake of his daughter’s death.\n\n“My family has experienced the unimaginable loss of our beloved daughter,” the mayoral candidate said. “We ask for privacy and your prayers at this time.”\n\nEmily is one of four adult children Austin shares with his wife, Virginia, according to his campaign website. She was a junior at Loyola Marymount University (LMU), where she was studying studio arts, according to a statement shared by the university in the wake of her death.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“Please join me in extending our deepest condolences to Emily’s family and loved ones, and in holding Emily and all who are grieving her loss in our collective thoughts and prayers,” said LMU President Thomas Poon.\n\nPoon also said that the L.A.-based private university will honor Emily with a plaque at its student memorial.\n\nAustin’s opponent in the mayoral race, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, also issued a statement following Emily’s death.\n\n“I am profoundly saddened by the news of the tragic passing of Austin Beutner’s daughter,” Bass said. “There is no way to describe the depth of pain experienced by parents who have lost a child. My heart is broken for the Beutner family, and I offer Austin, his wife Virginia, and their entire family my deepest condolences.\"\n\n\"I will hold them close in my heart,” the mayor’s statement continued, “and I am ready to assist the family with whatever they might need.”",

    "description": "\"It used to be common advice to figure out what you're good at, focus on that, and outsource everything else. We think that's bad advice.\"",
    "fullText": "Mike and Rob Barnes were just 19 and 22 when they founded Selkirk Sport, a pickleball equipment brand, in 2014.\n\nThe brothers had no college degrees, no outside investors, and no guarantee that pickleball, which was widely seen as a niche sport for seniors at the time, would ever catch on.\n\nBut they were hooked on the game, played on what resembles a miniature tennis court with a paddle roughly 16 inches long and a perforated plastic ball.\n\nThe unique thing about pickleball, invented on Bainbridge Island in 1965 by three dads looking to entertain their families, is its low barrier to entry.\n\n\"You can teach someone within an hour, and they'll have fun. Versus a game like tennis, where you have to put in a ton of hours to learn,\" Rob told Business Insider from the Selkirk HQ in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, where he, Mike, and their younger brother Tom were homeschooled and encouraged to pursue entrepreneurial projects. Mike and Rob started their first business in 2009, selling airsoft equipment and supplies.\n\n\"I remember there was a point where dad talked to us and said, 'OK, you can go to college, and you can go down that path, or you can keep doing what you're doing and just double down' — and we were like, let's double down, see what happens,\" recalled Rob.\n\nIt paid off in a big way. The family-run company, which Tom joined after a career in the Marines, is a leading pickleball brand known for its premium paddles, which have been the hero product since day 1. The brothers expect to generate at least $100 million in revenue in 2026 and have expanded to more than 200 employees.\n\n\"We're definitely big believers in education,\" Mike chimed in. \"It just doesn't necessarily have to be traditional education.\"\n\nLike their schooling, the way they operate their business is unconventional. Here are two business rules they live by.\n\nThe Barnes brothers don't believe there's a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to go about business.\n\n\"In a formal education environment, you often learn there's one way of doing things — and your goal is to avoid making a mistake,\" said Mike. \"That creates a mindset where people are just trying to learn the best practice so they don't mess up. Our mindset is more like, let's look at all the different ways people have done things and decide what actually makes sense for us.\"\n\nInstead of defaulting to industry norms, they focus on \"strategic practices\" that are grounded in evidence, context, and their specific business goals.\n\n\"'Best practice' is almost a bad word in our company,\" Mike said. \"If someone says, 'Let's do this because it's the best practice,' you actually have to bring in evidence and explain why it's 'best.'\"\n\nKeep in mind that \"no one's built a great business by doing everything exactly the same way everyone else does,\" added Rob. \"Be willing to be counterintuitive and challenge the status quo.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, Selkirk has embraced vertical integration.\n\n\"It used to be common advice to figure out what you're good at, focus on that, and outsource everything else,\" said Mike. \"We think that's bad advice, so we do pretty much the opposite. If something creates value for the customer, we try to do it in-house.\"\n\nThat includes research and development, which many competitors outsource to manufacturers. Selkirk has the only private sports science lab in pickleball, which they've invested roughly $1 million into.\n\nTheir hands-on approach requires a tolerance for mistakes.\n\n\"You have to be willing to move and make decisions knowing you're going to mess some things up,\" said Rob. \"Our dad always said, 'If you're never breaking dishes, it means you're not doing anything.'\"\n\nHe pointed to Theodore Roosevelt's famous \"Man in the Arena\" speech, which he has framed and acts as a guiding philosophy. The message, he said, is that criticism is inevitable when you're actually doing something.\n\n\"The synopsis is, everybody can judge the man in the arena who has blood and sweat on him. If you're doing anything meaningful, people are going to judge you constantly, so you might as well get in there, try to make a difference, and accept that mistakes are part of the process.\"",

    "description": "Nadya Grisczenkow struggled to find a job after college so she became a full-time nanny.   It brought her balance, happiness, and a solid paycheck.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nadya Grisczenkow, a 25-year-old nanny based in Boston. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nEveryone says you go to college, work hard, and you'll get a good job, and that just wasn't happening for me.\n\nI started applying to jobs, mostly social media and creative roles, during my senior year at Monclair State University in the spring of 2024. I felt defeated as graduation approached, and I didn't have any job offers from traditional applications or the PR firm I was interning at. I remember thinking, \"I feel like I'm doing all the right things.\"\n\nMy favorite quote of all time is \"what you're not changing, you're choosing,\" so I decided to pivot for the summer. I moved back in with my parents and siblings, hopped on a website for care providers and people searching for care to find a part-time nanny job, and became dead set on finding a full-time 9-to-5 by the fall.\n\nThat summer changed the trajectory of my life. Now I'm a full-time nanny, and I don't see myself going back. I made up to $1,600 weekly with the first family that hired me.\n\nI got hired as a part-time nanny for an amazing family, a husband, a very pregnant wife, and their toddler, but I saw it as an in-between before finding a corporate job.\n\nAs a new grad, navigating the job market was so overwhelming — there was a constant struggle to get my name to the top of the pile of applications. I kept getting my hopes up only to be let down, and the rejections took a toll on me. It got to a point where I really didn't know what I was doing wrong, but I felt like finding a traditional job was the only option.\n\nIt felt like everyone, even my sisters, we're saying things like \"Well, you can't just nanny,\" and it made me feel invalidated. As the oldest of five siblings, I felt a lot of internal pressure to set a good example for them.\n\nA few months later, my nanny family offered me a lucrative, full-time nanny position for their second child. I hadn't received any other job offers, and this position allowed me to work with a family I loved and spend more time with my sisters.\n\nThere was no reason to even think about turning it down, but I kept telling myself I needed to get out of nannying to feel fulfilled or make the people in my life proud. I feel like so many people don't see nannying as a legitimate position.\n\nIt also felt like I'd be disappointing myself because I had put so much pressure on myself to find a 9-to-5 job in the field I graduated in. We're ingrained to believe we should pursue a typical corporate job, but I had a gut feeling that wasn't the path for me.\n\nI realized this is my life, and I enjoy nannying, so I took the job.\n\nAfter accepting the full-time offer, I worried I might get \"stuck\" nannying or that I'd feel like the odd one out among my friends because I'm changing diapers all day instead of having meetings. When I started working with a wonderful family and making $30 an hour, those fears melted away.\n\nI really lucked out with my nanny family, because the mom, Hannah, and I became a true dynamic duo. We would take the kids everywhere together while her husband worked from home. She is now my best friend.\n\nThere were times I felt burned out from being around kids all day — it's certainly not for the weak — but I was so happy and enjoyed supporting their family. I'm now living in Boston, working for a new family with three kids, and travel-nannying on the side.\n\nI feel like when we're thinking about our careers, we're taught to figure out our natural skillset and how we can use it to get to the next level. As the oldest sibling, I've always been the nurturing, type A person who's used to managing chaotic energy. I enjoy feeling helpful and supportive.\n\nI thought back to my PR internship and realized that I sat at my cubicle and never felt truly useful. I was an intern, so of course I was doing bottom-of-the-barrel admin tasks, but I didn't feel like I was being used to the best of my abilities.\n\nAs a nanny, I feel so validated, seen, and fulfilled when I'm able to use my skillset to support my nanny family. Not everyone will understand nannying as a career choice, but I feel like I'm finally using my skills in the best way possible.\n\nI feel like I always put so much pressure on myself to have my next steps figured out, but I don't see any reason to shift out of nannying for a traditional 9-to-5. This version of my life makes me feel happy.\n\nOnce I learned to free myself from expectation, I realized that no matter what path I choose, I'll be successful if I feel fulfilled.\n\nMy current version of success means working a lot, maintaining a balanced life, supporting an amazing family, and making a lot of money. I shifted from wanting to be a successful corporate worker to feeling really confident in my choice as a nanny.\n\nDo you have a story to share about taking an unconventional career path? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Michigan State football is reportedly among the list of schools with the most transfer portal departures in all of college football.\n\nThe last month has been a busy one for the Spartans when it comes to the transfer portal, with an abundance of players coming and going from the program. The number of players leaving reportedly ranked among the top of all of college football, according to On3.\n\nAmong all teams in college football, Michigan State was No. 7 in total player departures with 37 players leaving via the transfer portal. Michigan State was No. 2 among Big Ten teams, behind only Penn State who ranked No. 3 nationally, with 46 players departing via the portal.\n\nAs expected with any coaching change, we saw a large number of Spartans leave from this past year's team. This included both high-level players such as wide receiver Nick Marsh, running back Makhi Frazier and quarterback Aidan Chiles, and also a lot of backups and reserves. Ultimately, we will not know until the fall if Michigan State is better or worse off with the players that have left and been replaced by incoming transfer portal additions. But, this high number of players leaving the program through the portal is something that at least is noteworthy and interesting to see.\n\nClick on the post below to see the complete rankings of teams with the most players leaving through the transfer portal from On3:\n\nNEW: Schools with the most College Football Transfer Portal departures🔁https://t.co/lbDS9V8lFd pic.twitter.com/DZrnqLIDi1\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "description": "In college, Cameron Mofid set out on a mission to visit every country — not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront his obsessive-compulsive disorder.",
    "fullText": "As a kid, I pored over maps, flags, and history books, curious about what life looked like in far-off corners of the world. At the same time, I was quietly struggling with debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder, which often left me feeling trapped inside my own mind.\n\nOne night during my freshman year at the University of Miami, I came across an article in my apartment that stunned me. It said that more people had been to space than had visited every country in the world.\n\nFinding that out changed the direction of my life. I decided to set out on a mission to visit every country, not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront my OCD and prove to myself that it didn't have to dictate the limits of my life.\n\nOver the next few years of college, I saved aggressively while working in nightlife marketing in Miami, putting aside just enough to make the trip possible if I budgeted carefully and kept costs low.\n\nWhen I told my parents about my plan, they laughed and shrugged it off, not quite taking me seriously. Not long after, I called one of my best friends. He laughed too and said just two words: \"Good luck.\"\n\nAfter graduating, I made it my mission. I backpacked mostly alone across conflict zones, remote islands, and places at the center of ancient history. On April 3, 2025, I reached my 195th and final country in North Korea. The journey was verified by NomadMania, the world's largest travel community, which confirmed that I was the youngest person ever to have visited every country.\n\nAfter completing my mission, a few places stood out as truly unforgettable. These are three cities I always suggest others experience — and one I wouldn't rush back to.\n\nOut of the hundreds of cities I've visited in my life, Sydney is my favorite. What stood out most was how relaxed and welcoming people were. The pace reminded me of my hometown in San Diego, with the same laid-back energy but an even greater sense of warmth.\n\nOne morning, while sitting at a café, an older couple at the table next to me struck up a conversation and started sharing their favorite places around the city. They talked about the coastal walks they loved, which neighborhoods were worth spending time in, and the restaurants they kept going back to. Interactions like that happened often enough that the friendliness stopped feeling like a novelty and became part of everyday life.\n\nAs I explored the city, I kept noticing how naturally beautiful it was. More than 100 beaches are within reach, including Bondi, where I watched surfers roll in with the tide. In the city center, I wandered through different neighborhoods and took in the mix of historic architecture and modern design. The sunsets were especially memorable. I watched ferries cut across the water as the skyline came into view, framed by the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge.\n\nSydney is the kind of city I could easily imagine building a life in.\n\nValletta felt like a living crossroads of history from the moment I arrived. Sitting at the center of the Mediterranean, the city reflects centuries of Italian, Arab, British, and North African influence, all packed into a compact, walkable capital.\n\nI'd walk past waterfront cafés and, minutes later, find myself standing on the city's fortified walls, looking out over waters once traveled by Phoenician traders, Ottoman fleets, and British warships.\n\nWhat surprised me most about Valletta was how under-visited it felt compared to much of southern Europe. Even during peak season, it never felt overrun. A short ferry ride away, I spent time on the island of Gozo, where life moved even slower. I visited ancient temples older than the Egyptian pyramids and passed through small villages where fishing and farming still shape daily life.\n\nExperiencing Gozo made Valletta feel even more special: a historic capital with easy access to a quieter, older side of the Mediterranean.\n\nKrabi wasn't even on my radar at first, and it ended up being one of the last places I reached on my journey. A Thai friend I'd met years earlier on the junior tennis circuit told me it was the most beautiful part of the country and insisted I couldn't miss it.\n\nHe was right. Krabi Town is the province's main city, but most travelers use \"Krabi\" to refer to the surrounding beaches and islands — and few places on Earth combine land and sea as dramatically. At Railay Beach, limestone cliffs rise from turquoise water, creating a backdrop unlike anything else I've seen.\n\nI took day trips through Phang Nga Bay and out toward the nearby Phi Phi Islands, weaving past mangrove forests and hidden coves that felt largely untouched. And then there was the food. For a few dollars, I could get a delicious local meal and a fresh dragon fruit smoothie from a roadside stall or beachside café.\n\nKrabi is a reminder that some of the most memorable places aren't always part of the original plan.\n\nIndia was one of the countries I was most excited to visit, and it delivered some amazing experiences. Seeing the Taj Mahal in Agra lived up to every expectation, and witnessing the ancient religious rituals along the Ganges in Varanasi was one of the most powerful cultural moments I've experienced anywhere in the world.\n\nThat said, New Delhi isn't a place I feel a strong pull to return to. The air quality was poor enough that I found myself coughing constantly, making it uncomfortable to spend much time outside. In a city of more than 22 million people, the traffic was relentless, adding to a sense of chaos that, unlike in other busy cities I've loved, never felt energizing. Compared to other parts of India, I also didn't find the city's main sights as compelling.\n\nI'm glad I went, and India as a whole left a lasting impression on me. But if I were planning another trip, New Delhi wouldn't be on my list.",

    "fullText": "I still remember pulling out of the driveway of the house I'd shared with the same five girls for three years.\n\nI sat in the passenger seat, waving goodbye as my boyfriend drove away. We both cried, unable to fathom that college was really over.\n\nAs we road-tripped from Ann Arbor, Michigan, back to the Northeast (where we're both from), we felt excited for the next chapter of our lives — starting our careers in New York City and moving in together. But we were also going through our own forms of a breakup, just not with each other.\n\nMy housemates and I weren't just housemates. We were pandemic-era housemates, meaning we ate breakfast together at our tiny kitchen table every morning and took our remote classes from the same living room couch.\n\nMy boyfriend had a similar experience, living with friends in a house around the corner from mine.\n\nSomewhere along the way, both of our friend groups became like family, barging into each other's houses without notice and spending endless hours together.\n\nI had no idea just how much I'd miss that.\n\nJust one month after graduation, I had a cute, albeit tiny, apartment in Manhattan with swanky restaurants on each corner, a pickleball court nearby, and 24/7 access to pizza and bagels. And I was doing it all with my boyfriend by my side.\n\nI had achieved the dream so many Long Island-raised kids like myself had growing up.\n\nBut as much as I tried to romanticize my compact kitchen appliances and lack of windows (and consequently, sunlight), I longed for sunny days on my front porch in Ann Arbor with my five best friends sipping lattes out of mason jars, talking about absolutely nothing.\n\nMy boyfriend missed his version of this, too, sipping bottles of beer with his five housemates, talking mostly about football.\n\nWe both longed to be somewhere else. And I, for one, felt guilty.\n\nStruggling to adjust to our 9-to-5 schedules in a new city, we often found ourselves sitting around the apartment, lacking the energy to do all the fun things we used to love.\n\nI did make some new friends, but I struggled to put in the effort to maintain them. I often wondered if it was even possible to find the same level of friendship I had with my college housemates.\n\nI'd replay the highlight reel of memories in my mind — prank wars that would last for weeks, communicating with our next-door neighbors via handwritten signs taped to our windows, and nights in watching old One Direction music videos.\n\nAlthough we still kept in touch via our group chat, it just wasn't the same as waking up every morning to all my favorite people in one place.\n\nIt was as if I'd been living in my very own sitcom for three years — one that could never be recreated — with the perfect mix of characters, all in the right place at the right time.\n\nAnd like all sitcoms, it had to come to an end. I was holding out hope for a spinoff, but I had to let go.\n\nI realized that what I really needed most was time. There wasn't one thing in particular that magically made me stop missing my friends so much. It took about a year to adapt to my new routine and start feeling like myself again.\n\nIn the meantime, I let myself be sad, and I stopped feeling guilty about it. I leaned on the one person who understood my sadness on a personal level: my boyfriend.\n\nWe talked about missing our best friends, Ann Arbor, and our life together before we moved to New York City. It felt good to have someone who was going through the same thing.\n\nSlowly but surely, we adjusted to our new reality and started finding joy in the little things, like decorating our apartment, trying new bagel spots, and perfecting homemade vodka sauce.\n\nAs for my housemates, we continue to find unique ways to stay in touch. We partake in our own Secret Santa each year. We email each other life updates through personalized newsletters that are way too detailed. We schedule visits throughout the year and meet up around the country. Every time we do, it's like we're back home.\n\nOf course, I still miss them. But I've learned to cherish the people that are nearby — both new friends I've met in the city and old ones I grew up with back on Long Island. I've also made more of an effort to spend time with family. Thankfully, they're only a train ride away.\n\nTwo and a half years postgrad, my boyfriend and I still live together, but now we have a new apartment with a full-sized oven and more windows to let in plenty of sunlight.\n\nWe see our best friends a few times a year and spend the remaining 300-and-something days trying to convince them all to move to New York. And in the meantime, we've built a life we're happy with.",

    "fullText": "This past week was a weird one for upsets. We didn’t get any huge, unexpected upsets of top-tier teams. But we did have some small underdogs pull through on their opponent’s home floor, such as UNC beating Virginia, Texas Tech beating Houston, and Illinois beating Purdue. Let’s see what this week brings!\n\nThe Wildcats have sustained a lot of injuries in the past few weeks, but I don’t think that will matter in this one. We have seen that you beat Vanderbilt by using size and strength in the frontcourt, and this could be a breakout game for any of Malachi Moreno, Andrija Jelavic, or Mo Dioubate.\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide has a myriad of issues going on. Not only are they facing national scrutiny over the eligibility of Charles Bediako, but they also have injuries to Ajay Allen and Aden Holloway. I think there’s just too much going on with Alabama right now for them to be fully focused and engaged with this game, and Missouri has a breakout star emerging in T.O. Barrett.\n\nSean Miller’s Longhorns have shown that they have a high ceiling, coming off a 20-point win over a ranked Georgia team. Auburn has shown us a low floor, with a loss to Missouri already on the schedule. Miller has Dailyn Swain playing the best basketball of his career, and I think he plays a huge role as Texas continues their march to an NCAA Tournament bid in his first season.\n\nI’m going to hop back on my travel schedule soapbox here. Let’s get this straight: Florida State is not good. Cal is better. But FSU has Rodney McCray and Chauncey Wiggins, who both play well at home, and Cal has not won a game outside the state of California this season. I think the road trip gets the better of them here.\n\nSaint Louis is rolling right now — if not for a desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer by Stanford, the Billikens would be undefeated. But all good things must come to an end. The “Battle for the Archbaron’s Cup” has been anything but predictable over the years, and would make a great occasion for Dayton to pull off the upset. Dayton finally has their two centers, Amael L’Etang and Malcolm Thomas, healthy, and may also get back Jordan Derkack for this game.\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nCFB:Most impactful transfer of 2025 college football season\n\nNBA: NBA star Derrick Rose reacts after unexpected surprise ahead of jersey retirement\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl LX graphic resurfaces\n\nTENNIS: Valentin Vacherot hits physics-defying shot at Australian Open\n\nVIRAL: Alex Honnold takes incredible selfie after historic Taipei 101 climb\n\nThe post Predicting upsets in College Basketball this week   appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Depending on the position, a high school diploma could be the ticket to a growing, high-paying job.\n\nBusiness Insider looked at wages and growth projections for jobs that usually need a high school diploma, its equivalent, or a postsecondary nondegree award. We then took the geometric mean of the ones that pay at least $75,000, based on 2024 median annual wage data, and are expected to need more workers, based on projected employment growth from 2024 to 2034. We then ranked the jobs, with the larger the geometric mean, the better the rank.\n\nMany of the top 12 fell into one of three job groups: construction and extraction; protective service; or installation, maintenance, and repair.\n\nFirst-line supervisors of construction trades and extraction workers took the top spot. Employment of these supervisors is expected to grow by 49,000 from its 2024 level, and they typically make about $79,000 annually. It's also one of the roles that typically don't require a degree, but often require job seekers to have relevant experience.\n\nEmployers may be interested in candidates with higher educational attainment.

    "fullText": "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has laid out an NFL-style system of fines for his players if they violate team rules, including $500 for being late to practice.\n\nHe showed it on the video screen in his first team meeting of 2026 on Jan. 23, as briefly seen in a video posted by his oldest son, Deion Jr. Here is what it said:\n\nLate to meeting or film session: $400\n\nNo-show to meeting or film session: $2,000\n\nLate to strength and conditioning workout: $1,000\n\nNo-show to strength and conditioning workout: $1,500\n\nViolation of team rules: $1,000-$2,500 based on severity.\n\nPublic or social media misconduct: $2,000-$5,000\n\nDamage to university or team property: repair cost +$3,000\n\nLoss of team technology or equipment: replacement cost +$1,000\n\nPlayers also are required to wear Nike shoes and apparel while representing the university at practices, games and organized team activities. Colorado has been a Nike-sponsored school since 1995. Sanders also is sponsored by Nike. Failure to comply also could result in disciplinary action.\n\nThere is an appeal process for players, with final decisions issued within five business days. But it's another example of the professionalization of college sports, with players this year getting paid directly by schools for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nA lack of discipline also apparently was an issue for Colorado last year, when the Buffaloes finished 3-9 during Sanders’ third season in charge.\n\n“All these lates and tardies and all these things, we can’t have that this year,” Colorado receivers coach Jason Phillips told the team. “Those are the things we will eliminate… Two ways to eliminate that. Either you change, or we change you.”\n\nSanders has brought in 42 new scholarship transfer players this year, offsetting more than 35 scholarship players who transferred out.\n\n“You all are hand-picked, hand-picked, hand-picked,” Sanders told the team. “We watched darn near every one of y’all.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

    "fullText": "The 2000s brought about a new archetype of character into pop culture: the “anti-hero.” Exemplified on television with the likes of Walter White and Tony Soprano, the anti-hero is a character who is by no means evil, but often has to do bad things as a means to an end.\n\nIn College Basketball, we’ve seen our share of heroes and villains through the years (here’s looking at you, Grayson Allen). But Charles Bediako, in the year 2025, is the exact anti-hero that the sport needs. His situation should bring about the necessary change that can save college basketball.\n\nIf the name Charles Bediako sounded familiar before he made national headlines this week, it’s because he was the starting center for Alabama in the 2022-2023 season. This team was notable not just because they were the #1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, but also because they had an active team member commit a murder midseason\n\nThey also had a star player and future top-5 NBA draft pick, Brandon Miller, who faced scrutiny over how involved he was in the said murder, in which he would eventually face no charges. That Alabama team was a national story every week that season.\n\nAfter the season ended, Bediako declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his remaining college eligibility. He would then play two full seasons in the G-League, never once getting called up to play in the NBA. And now, with the lines more blurred than ever in terms of what is allowed or not allowed in college basketball, he’s back playing for the Crimson Tide.\n\nWhile the NCAA has officially ruled him ineligible to continue to play college basketball, Bediako got a temporary restraining order from an Alabama judge (who happens to have ties to the program), allowing him to play games in the state of Alabama. Bediako shined in Alabama’s loss to Tennessee on Saturday, scoring 13 points in 25 minutes off the bench.\n\nIf it sounds villainous for someone to go behind the NCAA’s back to try to allow themselves to play in a sport that they left almost three years ago, that’s what makes Bediako the perfect anti-hero. No one can put individual blame on Bediako or on coach Nate Oats for this particular situation. Nate Oats’s career is defined by winning basketball games. And if Bediako can help him win, of course, he’s going to fight to get him back on the roster.\n\nFor Bediako, his goal is to continue to play basketball for as long as he can and make as much money as he can while doing it. So, if he’s not going to get called up to the NBA, and his G-League timer is not getting any longer, why not explore this option of getting to play again at Alabama? You simply can’t blame either Bediako or Oats for this predicament — they’re behaving rationally in their own self-interests.\n\nInstead, blame the NCAA. The NIL era has allowed “the line” to continue to change. What do I mean when I say “the line”? The line is the thing that, once a player crosses, he can no longer come back to college basketball. The line simply used to be “declare for the NBA draft.”\n\nThen it moved to “declare for the draft and hire an agent.” When NIL made agents more commonplace, it then became “play in a professional, pay-to-play” basketball league. But then, players like Creighton’s Fedor Zugic, who had played professionally in Europe, began to challenge this convention.\n\nThen, you have Baylor’s James Nnaji, who was drafted by the NBA but played professionally overseas, being allowed to play college basketball this season. What makes the Bediako situation even more interesting is that Abdullah Ahmed, a player who played in the G-League before ever playing college basketball, is being allowed to play for BYU this season.\n\nSo, I say all of this to say, where is “the line”? And has Bediako crossed it? The Bediako situation is so unique and represents such a unique series of events that it is going to force the NCAA into redefining where the line is and creating a uniform, inarguable policy that will make these situations much more black and white in the future, instead of living in the gray area of temporary restraining orders and court cases.\n\nThat would bring about a positive change to the sport in the long run, which would make Bediako the ultimate anti-hero. Not unlike how Ed O’Bannon became the face of the early NIL movement, Bediako can become the face of the line between professional and college basketball.\n\nCheck out all of our NFL articles: https://www.thebiglead.com/category/nfl/\n\nThe post One of College Basketball’s most controversial decisions has a new twist  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Anna Kendrick, 40, says watching her friends go to college made her second-guess her decision to pursue acting.\n\n\"I was really, really jealous of all my friends that were going to college. Number one, because I felt really insecure about not going to college. I have a whole, you know, complex about it,\" Kendrick said on Friday's episode of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nSeeing her friends quickly build community through classes and sororities made her feel even more unsure as she tried to find her footing in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I was 17 or 18. It's really hard to make friends in LA because of, like, the way the city is laid out, but especially when you don't have a fake ID. Even if I did, I looked about 12, so that wasn't going to work anyway,\" Kendrick said. \"And I was just like absolutely terrified and really wondering if I was like, making a huge mistake.\"\n\nHer perspective began to change when her friends hit sophomore year and had to start figuring out their future paths.\n\n\"Even though the thing that I wanted felt like a total pipe dream, and like, 'What am I doing? This is a disaster. It's so hard to carve out a space for yourself in this industry,'\" Kendrick said.\n\n\"But on the other side of it, holy shit, I did not think like, what a blessing to just know what I want. I was like watching all my friends go, 'Oh my god, I don't know what I want, what to do,'\" she continued.\n\nThe \"Pitch Perfect\" star said her decision not to go to college felt especially difficult because it went against the path her family valued.\n\n\"I was like the first person to not go to college. And my dad was a teacher and everything, so it was like very black sheep behavior to not go to college,\" Kendrick said.\n\nShe added her parents weren't thrilled with her decision, but accepted that she was going to do what she wanted. At the same time, her parents saw college as something she could revisit if acting didn't work out.\n\n\"I think there was always that sense of like, well, if things maybe don't work out that first year, it's not too late to just, you know, so I think that was always like something that they had in mind,\" Kendrick said.\n\nIt also didn't help that questions about college kept coming up when she was in her early 20s, before her acting career had fully taken off.\n\n\"Like, oh my god, I have to say I didn't. And at that point, you know, like 21, 22, I didn't really have much to show for it yet,\" Kendrick said.\n\nKendrick isn't the only Hollywood celebrity who has spoken about not going to college.\n\n\"Harry Potter\" star Daniel Radcliffe told E! News in 2013 that he skipped college because he \"already knew\" what he wanted to do.\n\n\"I think a large part of why people go to college is to figure out what they want to do,\" he said. \"I very much knew what I wanted to do, so I kind of just figured I'd keep carrying on trying to do that.\"\n\nIn 2024, Julia Roberts told British Vogue that she regrets not going to university.\n\n\"It wasn't in my cards,\" Roberts said, adding that her family didn't have the money and she \"had no scholarship potential.\"",

    "description": "Remote college in 2020 didn't work for Jacob Palmer. “It felt very intangible, is the best way that I have found to say it ... It didn’t work for me. I hated it.”",
    "fullText": "Growing up in Concord, North Carolina, just outside Charlotte, Jacob Palmer was a classic academic achiever. “I was a good student,” he said in an interview with Fortune. “In high school, I participated in all types of extracurriculars, student leadership, I did a lot of public speaking. I had all sorts of friends.” But he said something changed during the pandemic. “School looked drastically different doing online classes and Zoom calls. It felt very intangible.” He said he figured out pretty quickly that online college “didn’t work for me. I hated it.”\n\nPalmer said that instead of sticking with college, he tried things out, including a stint at a FedEx warehouse for several months, and a change of scenery at his grandparents in rural Virginia, where he worked at a factory for a few months.\n\nWhen he returned home, in need of a job, his mom was putting in a hot tub and she mentioned the electrician working on it was “super passionate and loved his job.” Palmer said he sounded him out, estimating that the electrician was about 29 at the time, and Palmer liked that he worked for himself.\n\n“I had a general interest in working with my hands, fixing and making things, as well as a basic understanding of electrical theory from my time in AP Physics class,” he said. Soon afterward, he started as a full-time apprentice at a small, Charlotte-based contracting firm, earning $15 an hour at first and working his way up the ladder.\n\nHe was far from alone. Palmer’s micro-generation abandoned college in droves during the pandemic, driving 42% of an overall 15% decline in undergraduate enrollment between fall 2010 and fall 2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Overall, college may have peaked, as experts have predicted a “demographic cliff” ever since 2007, when Americans started having fewer children with the coming of the Great Recession, and birthrates have not recovered since, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Palmer was part of a movement deciding to try something else instead of college.\n\n“I spent a few years just untangling the extension cords and doing the grunt work,” he said, earning hours en route to sitting for an electrical license. But even though he didn’t become a college student, he still found himself studying hard, because he had to pass his licensing exam, in January 2024. Just a month later, at 21, he opened his own business, Palmer Electrical. By the end of that year, according to profit and loss statements reviewed by Fortune, he grossed nearly $90,000. This nearly doubled to $175,000 in 2025 and he said he was “thinking $250,000 is a good goal for 2026, but my main focus is still to continue learning and make new opportunities.”",

    "description": "Every Sunday night, my family came together for dinner. But now that both of my sons are in college and I'm an empty nester, I bring dinner to them.",
    "fullText": "In my family, Sunday was always family dinner night. Whether the Packers earned another triumphant win, a swim meet went late, or a last-minute homework assignment loomed on Monday morning, that time to eat and enjoy each other's company was an appointment that could not be canceled.\n\nWhen my two boys headed off to college, Sundays became more subdued. Yes, my husband and I opened a bottle of wine and enjoyed our dinner leisurely, but I craved more. The meal needed something; it needed that seasoning from my sons' snarky retort, a roaring laugh, and even that persistent eye roll.\n\nSince I missed our weekly family dinners, I started a monthly family pizza night across the miles.\n\nThe idea is simple: I pick a day and time, compile the orders, and everyone gets a pizza delivery at the same time. Whether it is my oldest, who wants copious amounts of meat on that slice, or the younger one, who prefers variety, I order enough for everyone — including all the roommates and friends. Then we jump on video calls and chat while we eat.\n\nThe phrase \"everyone is family at the table\" is cliché, but everyone is welcome to join. No, I do not force friends to chat, but they must appreciate my \"rules.\" It is not rapid-fire Socratic questioning, but people cannot just devour food and disappear.\n\nEveryone sends pizza photos, curious comments, and FaceTimes while we are eating. Yes, it sounds like the dinner parties people hosted in 2020, but it works. We catch up, laugh, and just have a collective moment.\n\nSure, I cannot cajole the boys as easily through a screen, but I can get a response that is more than just a one-word text reply.\n\nOf course, some people will say I'm bribing my kids to interact with me, but it doesn't matter to me. The reality is that family traditions are not just holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions. Making time for each other is vital, and food can be the catalyst.\n\nAt, around, and by the table, I have learned much about my sons over the years. It was more than excitement over a good grade or disappointment about a lost swim race. I have seen their better understanding of personal relationships, their appreciation for culture, and their interest in family history.\n\nListening to their word choices and argument construction, and even just watching them sit quietly, is far more telling than another call or text when they are away from home. I might have nurtured them with food, but they grew into the men that they are today because of our family connection.\n\nThis current pizza dinner might be a slice of what we had, but it is one that I crave even more.\n\nWhile my pizza night family dinner solution works with college kids, I look forward to keeping this tradition going long after they graduate. Whether one is in Florida and the other is halfway around the world, we can and should make our family a priority. Every overlooked opportunity is a missed one.\n\nSince pizza, or some version of flatbread, can be found anywhere in the world, there are no excuses for skipping this dinner. Even on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean, family pizza night is on the schedule. No matter how I slice it, the concept works.\n\nFor any parent looking to keep family bonds strong, creative solutions are all around. Whether it is a pizza, grandma's cookies, or a Big Mac, food is a form of communication. My family tradition tells my boys that the time we spend together nourishes me far beyond the food served on the plate.",

    "description": "Brothers Rob and Mike Barnes started Selkirk Sport in 2014, when they were just 19 and 22 — and when pickleball was considered \"a senior sport.\"",
    "fullText": "If you play pickleball, you've probably seen a Selkirk paddle on the court. You might even use one yourself.\n\nThe Idaho-based, family-run company Selkirk Sport has become practically synonymous with pickleball. It makes premium paddles, shoes, apparel, balls, and nets — \"everything except the court surface,\" said Tom Barnes, the youngest of the three brothers who co-own the company.\n\nThere's just one nonnegotiable: Whatever they produce has to stay in the pickleball lane.\n\n\"We will only ever do pickleball. This was intentional from day one,\" Tom, the director of R&D, told Business Insider during a tour of the company's innovation lab in Coeur d'Alene, where paddles are put through rigorous stress testing using cannons and CT scanners. \"It's called Selkirk Sport. It's not called Selkirk Sports.\"\n\nTom joined the company after his older brothers, Mike and Rob, who started Selkirk alongside their father, Jim, in 2014. At the time, Mike and Rob were just 19 and 22, but it wasn't their first venture.\n\nA few years prior, they'd started a company selling airsoft equipment out of their dad's basement. It was part of a homeschool project. Jim, a retired fireman, saw value in teaching his kids entrepreneurial skills. The company quickly outgrew the basement and took over their childhood home. By 2013, they had leased a small building.\n\nFor a short time, they ran both companies simultaneously, but eventually sold the airsoft business and chose to skip college to go all-in on Selkirk.\n\nIt was a risk. Back then, pickleball had a very different reputation. It was considered \"a senior sport,\" said Rob. He and Mike, who first discovered the game at a local rec center in 2009 and were immediately hooked, were convinced it would take off beyond the retirement community.\n\nThey were right, but it took years — and a global pandemic that encouraged socially distant activities — before the rest of the country caught on.\n\nThe Barnes brothers saw a lot of opportunity in the pickleball space, as there was virtually zero competition.\n\nThe paddle market was wide open, said Mike: \"Everyone had basically the same paddle. There wasn't innovation. There wasn't anything new.\"\n\nThey set out to change that. Their first year in business, 2014, was pure trial and error. They sourced materials, assembled paddles themselves, and tested and tweaked them until they were satisfied.\n\n\"It was definitely more of an art form than a science back then,\" Rob said.\n\nToday, Selkirk has invested millions into an in-house innovation lab dedicated to understanding the physics of pickleball and building high-performance equipment. But, for years, the company broke even, and the brothers barely paid themselves, despite working 100-hour weeks.\n\n\"I calculated it once,\" Mike said. \"When you factor in the hours we worked versus what we paid ourselves, we probably made less than minimum wage for the first eight years.\"\n\nThey never felt discouraged. Pickleball continued gaining traction, and the company grew every year. They said Selkirk has posted double-digit annual growth over the past decade.\n\nThen, the pandemic hit. After a brief shutdown during which public parks and courts were closed, pickleball emerged as a safe, socially distanced activity.\n\n\"And then it just kind of never stopped.\"\n\nAs pickleball has continued to win over Americans — it's been deemed the fastest-growing sport in the US three years in a row by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association (SFIA) — the market has become increasingly competitive.\n\nIn the early years, the brothers were competing with five to 10 brands. Now, it's closer to 600, said Mike: \"After the pandemic, interest rates were low. Lots of easy money and investment flowed into the sport, and so the number of brands exploded.\"\n\nConcentrating on one sport, Mike said, is their edge.\n\n\"We think our ability to focus is one of our secret weapons. You've seen major brands like Head and Adidas try to enter the pickleball market, but they've been really struggling to make an impact. We see pickleball more like golf, where you need to be an endemic brand that's really focused.\"\n\nIt's worked so far. Selkirk went from 16 employees in January 2019 to 230 by January 2026, and said revenue has increased by 1,900% since 2019. The company fulfills roughly 1,000 orders a day and up to 2,500 during the holiday season. They also have more than 1,400 retail partners, including Dick's Sporting Goods and Target, as well as an exclusive partnership with Costco.\n\nThe brothers plan to stay ahead by continuing to invest in R&D to deliver premium products.\n\nOutside capital will help with that.\n\nEarlier this year, Selkirk took its first-ever institutional funding: a $30 million growth equity investment from Bluestone Equity Partners, Forbes reported. It also reported that Selkirk expects to generate at least $100 million in revenue in 2026.\n\nThose are big numbers, but it's been more than a decade in the making, Mike pointed out: \"It's a lot of work. I think there's a lot of glamour nowadays — a lot of hype about what it means to be an entrepreneur — and, at the end of the day, it is about doing the boring things and just waking up and being consistent every day.\"\n\nTaking a chance on a game they believed had potential before most everyone else did helped, added Rob: \"We got into pickleball before it was cool. If you're waiting to jump into the latest trend, you're probably too late.\"",

    "fullText": "Louisville women’s basketball hosting Boston College on Saturday had all the makings of a trap game.\n\nThe seventh-ranked Cardinals were coming off two difficult wins, at Notre Dame and N.C. State, the weekend before. Then, their game against the Eagles, who were on a 13-game losing streak, had to be played a day early due to Winter Storm Fern. Louisville (19-3, 9-0 ACC) didn’t have the cleanest start to the game, turning the ball over six times in the first quarter. But the squad proved its ability to push through mistakes and avoid the trap, recording a 85-56 win over Boston College (4-18,0-9) at the KFC Yum! Center.\n\nUofL downing N.C. State and Notre Dame on the road showed how high its celling could be. Avoiding a letup in less competitive games will be critical for the Cardinals as they remain in the hunt for a regular-season ACC championship. Four of the Cardinals' final nine ACC opponents have losing records in conference play.\n\nMackenly Randolph took her turn leading the Cardinals with a career high-tying 13 points as the team recorded its 12th straight victory. It was the sixth straight game where UofL had a different leading scorer. The offense was needed to make up for the team’s turnover problem, many of which have been unforced. Louisville had a combined 21 turnovers against the Wolfpack and Irish last weekend but had 16 after the third quarter against Boston College.\n\nThe Eagles only totaled nine points off the miscues as part of a struggling offense that knocked down 29% of its shots from the field.\n\nWhen they weren’t turning it over, the Cardinals were efficient shooters. They made 55% of their field goals with all 12 of their available players entering the scoring column. UofL built a 10-0 lead in the first quarter, and Boston College never got closer than eight points for the rest of the game. The Cardinals’ lead ballooned to 42 points in the first four minutes of the fourth quarter, and the squad sailed to a win.\n\nLouisville has a road trip out west next week, beginning with Stanford at 8 p.m. Thursday and California at 2 p.m. next Sunday.\n\nReach Louisville football, women's basketball and baseball beat writer Alexis Cubit at acubit@gannett.com and follow her on X at @Alexis_Cubit.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Boston College vs Louisville women's basketball score, ACC standings",

    "description": "Get the best Tennessee vs. Alabama predictions ahead of Saturday's matchup in Tuscaloosa. Free college basketball picks for January 24.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Volunteers look to get their season back on track as they head to Tuscaloosa for a showdown with the No. 17 Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nTennessee has lost three of its last five, but that slide can’t be pinned on five-star freshman Nate Ament, who I’m backing to have a big game in my Tennessee vs. Alabama predictions.\n\nHere are my best free college basketball picks for this conference clash on Saturday, January 24.\n\nTennessee vs Alabama best bet: Nate Ament Over 15.5 points (-120)\n\nTennessee forward Nate Ament is averaging 15.4 points and 6.3 rebounds per game and has shown improved efficiency of late. The silky-smooth 6-foot-10 freshman is shooting 49.1% from the field over his last six games after connecting at just a 38% clip across his first 12 contests.\n\nAment has scored 17 or more points in three straight games and draws a favorable matchup tonight against an Alabama team that plays at a blazing-fast pace while offering little resistance on defense.\n\nThe Crimson Tide are 329th nationally in points allowed per game (82.6), with that number ballooning to 86.8 against high-major opponents. They also sit outside the top 300 in free throws allowed per game (25.2), while Ament ranks in the top 15th percentile in free-throw rate.\n\nAment’s ability to score in transition and consistently get to the line should help him eclipse his points total tonight.\n\nLet’s also back Ament to have a productive night on the glass, as Alabama’s extremely fast tempo has the Tide ranked 358th in rebounds allowed per game (41.3).\n\nTennessee hasn’t looked great of late, but neither has Alabama, which is 2–7 ATS in its last nine games against Top-100 KenPom opponents at home. The Vols check in at No. 23 at KenPom and are 14th in adjusted defensive efficiency.\n\nTennessee would have a solid chance to cover this spread even if the Tide were at full strength, and that may not be the case. Alabama’s second- and third-leading scorers, Aden Holloway and Amari Allen, have both been downgraded to questionable for tonight.\n\nWith the Tide possibly missing their second and third-highest scorers against a strong Vols defense, I'm leaning towards the Under on a lofty total.\n\nThe Under has cashed in 10 of 12 meetings between these SEC foes during Rick Barnes' tenure.\n\nSpread: Tennessee +6.5 (-110) | Alabama -6.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Tennessee +230 | Alabama -280\n\nOver/Under: Over 167.5 (-110) | Under 167.5 (-110)\n\nThe Vols have gone 4-0 SU and 3-1 ATS in the last four meetings between these conference foes.

    "description": "D1 college football was my entire life, so when it ended, I completely lost myself and gained weight. I turned to boxing to lose 120 pounds.",
    "fullText": "When my D1 college football career ended, I didn't just lose the game. I lost my identity.\n\nFootball had structured my entire life: my schedule, my body, my purpose. When that structure disappeared, I didn't know who I was anymore. I had been living what I now recognize as a lukewarm lifestyle, doing just enough to get by, but not anchored in anything solid. Without football, there was nothing left to lean on.\n\nI let my life deteriorate, and it took a lot to get back on track.\n\nGrief and uncertainty compounded quickly. I withdrew from people. I stopped training. I stopped caring for my body. I gained weight rapidly and avoided mirrors. By the time I finally confronted reality, I weighed around 300 pounds.\n\nAt my lowest point, I was living at home and working at FedEx, making roughly $400 a week. There is nothing wrong with honest work, but for me, it symbolized how far I had fallen from the man I once believed I was called to be.\n\nI wasn't just overweight. I felt directionless, embarrassed, and spiritually empty.\n\nOne night, exhausted and overwhelmed, I prayed honestly for the first time in a long time. I didn't ask for success or shortcuts. I asked for strength, clarity, and the courage to face myself. That prayer didn't change everything overnight, but it changed the direction of my life.\n\nWhat followed wasn't motivation. It was obedience, discomfort, and discipline.\n\nI knew I had to get uncomfortable if I wanted a different life. Comfort had nearly destroyed me, so I started showing up early, doing things that scared me, and putting myself in environments that demanded confidence before I felt ready. Faith gave me the foundation, but discipline gave me the reps.\n\nI didn't grow up thinking of myself as violent. I didn't believe I was capable of real aggression or dominance. Stepping into a boxing gym changed everything. You can't hide in the ring. Fear, insecurity, and doubt show up immediately. Training humbled me. It also rebuilt me.\n\nSlowly, the weight came off. Over nine months, I lost 120 pounds. The first six months were the most dramatic, nearly 85 pounds, but the physical change was only part of it. I was rebuilding confidence, identity, and belief in myself one disciplined day at a time.\n\nWhen I entered the Houston Golden Gloves tournament, I wasn't chasing a title. I was testing who I had become. Standing in the ring, I realized I wasn't becoming someone new. I was finally operating as the man I always believed I was capable of being. Discipline had uncovered confidence. Faith had restored identity.\n\nThat same approach reshaped the rest of my life.\n\nI transitioned into a new professional path, working remotely. I finally had a financial turnaround. It was the compound effect of disciplined habits applied everywhere.\n\nLosing Clay and losing football forced me to confront a hard truth: Life doesn't pause to let you grieve neatly. Loss comes in waves. Without structure and faith, it can pull you under.\n\nWhat I've learned is that rebuilding doesn't start with motivation. It starts with obedience. Discipline creates stability. Faith gives it meaning.",

    "title": "Letters to Sports: Readers debate whether the Dodgers are ruining baseball",
    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times give their thoughts on the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the Rams, the LeBron James-Jeanie Buss rift and college football.",
    "fullText": "The fury over the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker makes me wonder who's shouting the loudest?\n\nCould it be desperate, unfortunate fans whose beloved teams are owned by inheritors, nepo families, or private equity bros who celebrate their glamorous assets?\n\nSo how about a new metric in the sports page to accompany the ranking of teams and players: ownership. Not simply by wealth, but wisdom, brains and commitment. And for fun let's call it the McCourt-Moreno Index.\n\nIt's time we hold the Marge Schotts of pro sports accountable for the franchises they mismanage.\n\nThere are some alarming implications to Bill Plaschke's \"If it blows up baseball, so be it.\" Perhaps he means that MLB should be reduced to a burning garbage heap with three teams atop — Yankees, Cubs and Dodgers — because they were the only ones who went into the TV business and peddled their services for billions in the three largest TV markets.\n\nMaybe he yearns to transform MLB into the NHL of my childhood, with six teams. That was OK if you lived in a shallow arc extending between New York and Chicago — not so good for everyone else.\n\n\"So be it,\" as Plaschke would say, but I can guarantee I won't be the only one who isn't watching anymore.\n\nNaturally Dodger fans are all excited about the signing of the $60-million-a-year All-Star right fielder, Kyle Tucker. But we're not going to be happy when Dodger Stadium becomes the first MLB ballpark with a two-drink minimum.\n\nAs everyone seems to be raving about the Dodgers' acquisition of Kyle Tucker, I note the following: There is another player who was recently signed by the Yankees for less money and less signing bonus than Tucker who had higher numbers last year in average, home runs and WAR. He also plays more positions. Hadn’t the Dodgers heard of Cody Bellinger? Bellinger as a Yankee will never feel right to me.\n\nAsk a Major League Baseball owner like Arte Moreno, who sells out his ballpark whenever the Dodgers come to Anaheim, and sees Angel broadcast ratings surge whenever his team plays the Dodgers, if he thinks the Dodgers are ruining the game.\n\nThe Rams won the battle of which team gets to lose to Seattle.\n\nThe NFL needs to clarify exactly what does and doesn’t constitute pass interference. There is no consistency as to how it's called with each official seeming to have their own definition of what constitutes pass interference. It has gotten to the point where it’s worse than major league umpires and their own definition of the strike zone. NFL, you need to clean this up because these are major calls that are ruining games.\n\nBill Plaschke finally wrote a column about the Lakers with which I agree. LeBron James is the past, Austin Reaves is the future, and $50 million will help the Lakers rebuild. Yes, it's really as simple as that.\n\nWith the Lakers defense costing them multiple games, reminiscent of the coach Mike (no D)'Antoni days, the only real interesting Laker news last week were the alleged Jeanie Buss comments about the King. They sounded like they were lines taken from a scene in \"The Godfather\" .... \"What have I done to make you treat me so disrespectfully.\" My opinion is that it \"was not personal and strictly business.\"\n\nWhen asked after each game how he'd celebrate another victory, Indiana's Curt Cignetti would say, \"With a beer.\" After guiding his team to an undefeated season, and then winning the national championship, I doubt the Hoosiers' coach will ever have to buy another beer again.\n\nLincoln Riley is officially on the clock. In two years Curt Cignetti took a woebegone college team, with nary a five-star player, to an undefeated national championship. Cignetti has proven that, even in the NIL era, coaching matters. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick …\n\nCurt Cignetti and Indiana football playing in and winning the national championship was a modern-day version of the movie \"Hoosiers\" and would have made coach Norman Dale (actor Gene Hackman) proud. Now the question is, can new UCLA football coach Bob Chesney and his 40-plus transfers be the second coming of Indiana? Only time will tell.\n\nKings president Luc Robitaille appears to be happy with the Kings' status quo that appears to be getting one point every game in an overtime or shootout loss. Should we start referring to him as Luc RobitailleandthenloseinOT?\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views. Letters should be brief and become the property of The Times.

    "fullText": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A lawyer for fired University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore declared his innocence Thursday and said charges of home invasion and stalking were based on an effort by a staff member to get a financial windfall from the school's “deep pockets.\"\n\nIn a court filing, defense attorney Ellen Michaels responded to allegations that shocked college football in December. It also signals that Moore, who was fired for a relationship with the staffer and arrested hours later, is fighting the charges and wants the case dismissed.\n\n“This Court is not confronted with a close call or a technical defect,” Michaels wrote. “It is confronted with a prosecution that never should have begun.”\n\nMoore was abruptly fired on Dec. 10 for having an inappropriate relationship and for lying during the university's investigation, his dismissal letter states.\n\nAuthorities say Moore later that day entered the woman’s apartment, blamed her for the firing and grabbed butter knives and kitchen scissors while threatening to kill himself.\n\nA prosecutor quoted Moore as telling the woman, “My blood is on your hands.”\n\nMoore, 39, has pleaded not guilty to charges of felony home invasion, stalking and illegal entry.\n\nMichaels said the warrant to arrest Moore was deeply flawed because police wrongly informed a magistrate that Moore had been stalking the woman for months and was dangerous.\n\nMichaels said police relied on misinformation from the woman's personal lawyer, Heidi Sharp, as it investigated what happened. Michaels doesn't dispute that Moore turned up at the woman's apartment, but she claims there's no evidence that she had told him to stay away.\n\n“A magistrate must be given a fair and accurate picture. When the picture is distorted, the warrant cannot stand,” Michaels wrote.\n\nShe accused Sharp of giving information to police to “villainize Mr. Moore and maximize the chances of obtaining a large settlement from the deep pockets of the University of Michigan.”\n\nA message seeking comment from Sharp was not immediately returned.\n\nEarlier Thursday, a judge held a hearing to get an update on the case. Michaels disclosed that she had filed the request to quash the arrest and would argue it at a future date.\n\nWashtenaw County assistant prosecutor Kati Rezmierski said she had just received the filing. The next hearing was set for Feb. 17.\n\nMoore arrived at the courthouse with his wife, Kelli and waited in an adjacent courtroom for his case to be called. He declined to comment but stood nearby when Michaels briefly spoke to reporters and said he's innocent.\n\nMoore coached the Wolverines for two seasons as the successor to Jim Harbaugh, who won a national championship before quitting to become coach of the NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nKyle Whittingham, who coached Utah for two decades, is the new Michigan coach.",

    "fullText": "The Defense Department is rethinking what it means to serve your country, and it no longer necessarily involves a uniform.\n\nThrough a new initiative called the US Tech Force, the federal government is recruiting college students and Silicon Valley's brightest to spend two years modernizing government systems, working as engineers, data scientists, and technical leaders.\n\n\"We're hoping to get thousands of people out of college for a two-year stint — sort of make it, this is your service to the country as a technologist rather than as a soldier,\" Emil Michael, the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering and the agency's chief technology officer, said last week on the No Priors podcast, a tech show hosted by venture capitalists Sarah Guo and Elad Gil. Michael previously worked as Uber's chief business officer.\n\n\"We're going to try to make that a badge of honor,\" he added.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management, which is headed by former VC Scott Kupor, is coordinating the early-career program in partnership with other agencies, including the Department of Defense. Salaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said in December.\n\nThe program, announced in December, joins a long history of initiatives by Silicon Valley technologists to pluck students out of classrooms and into boardrooms. Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency famously brought a youthful energy and move-fast-and-break-things ethos to Capitol Hill. Palantir's Meritocracy Fellowship implored high schoolers to \"skip the indoctrination\" of college and \"get the Palantir Degree.\"\n\nMichael told Guo he is personally doing some of the candidate hunting, spending what he calls \"recruiting Tuesdays,\" dialing his investor buddies for people \"on the bench\" and technologists in his network who recently left a job: \"I'm like, 'Hey, do you have a year to spare doing the coolest stuff you could possibly imagine?'\"",

The ruling from U.S.",
    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”\n\nDuring the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”\n\n“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”\n\nIn his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.\n\n“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment\n\nDuring last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.\n\nAmong the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.\n\nBut in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.\n\nThe decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.\n\nAnother was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nDuring the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country's top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.\n\n“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”\n\nRamya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”\n\n“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",

    "description": "The 2025 college football season is now in the books, which means the final AP Poll of the year is out. Where did the Trojans come in?",
    "fullText": "On Monday night, Indiana defeated Miami to win its first ever national championship. With it, the 2025 college football season is now officially in the books.\n\nOn Tuesday, the final AP Poll of the season was released. USC came in at No. 20—four spots lower than where it ranked in the final regular season poll last month. The Trojans dropped their final game of the year, falling 30-27 to TCU in the Alamo Bowl.\n\nUSC was one of six Big Ten teams ranked in the final poll. The national champion Hoosiers were No. 1, followed by No. 4 Oregon and No. 5 Ohio State. In addition, Iowa was ranked No. 17 and Michigan No. 21.\n\nDoes it make sense to have USC three spots behind an Iowa team that the Trojans finished with the same record as and beat head-to-head? No. Is it worth complaining about at this point? Also no. Finishing a few spots higher in the final poll would not have meant much for USC in the scheme of things.\n\nNext season, USC is slated to face three of the top five teams from the final 2025 rankings. The Trojans will visit Indiana and host Ohio State and Oregon. It will certainly not be an easy road next year as USC enters what could be a make-or-break season for head coach Lincoln Riley.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: USC football ranked No. 20 in final AP Poll of season",

Social media users quickly caught onto the audio and praised the partnership.\n\nSO proud of you @Romeo!! Well deserved! 🥹❤️ #drpepper #goodandnice #drpepperjingle #nationalchampionshipgame #espn\n\n\"Dr Pepper, baby, it's good and nice,\" Bingham sang in a TikTok video posted December 23.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the post had over 44 million views and 50,000 comments from users and brands alike. Bingham's video gained traction on TikTok before the jingle was featured in a TV commercial, prompting some users to predict a collaboration was on the horizon.\n\n\"I am waiting for Dr Pepper to offer a massive contract,\" one commenter said on December 29.\n\n@Dr Pepper please get back to me with a proposition we can make thousands together. #drpepper #soda #beverage\n\nBingham and Dr Pepper did not reveal the terms of their deal and did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSeveral companies, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Panera Bread, and Hyundai, have also pounced on Bingham's comments and requested jingles for their brands.\n\nBingham created a song for Vita Coca, which the beverage brand posted on TikTok on January 16.\n\n@Romeo jingle stays on repeat #vitacoco #fyp #coconutwater #jingle #vitacocotreats\n\nThe partnership between Bingham and Dr Pepper appeared to be in the works for a few weeks leading up to the game, which ESPN reported attracted over 20 million viewers in 2025. On December 31, Dr Pepper commented under Bingham's video, telling them to check their DMs.\n\nSupport for Bingham has continued, with users sharing videos and comments congratulating them on the collaboration. Others have chimed in, saying they hoped Bingham got a good payday.\n\nI hope that girl who did the Dr. pepper jingle got paid very well. Cause I just saw the commercial.\n\nAnd the marketing strategy seems to be working for Bingham. As of Wednesday, Bingham is operating a website offering the Dr Pepper effect to brands.\n\n\"I'm buying a Dr Pepper just because,\" one user wrote on TikTok.",

    "description": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.",
    "fullText": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.\n\nThe device – which uses an approach called trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) - was cleared for use by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) to treat ADHD in 2019 based on a small study. These new findings from a larger multicentre trial, published in the journal Nature Medicine, suggest authorities should revisit the original evidence that supported the FDA clearance. Notably, TNS is currently not recommended for use in the UK by NICE guidelines.\n\nThe trial was run in collaboration with University of Southampton and funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Programme, a partnership between the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and the UKRI Medical Research Council (MRC), with further support from the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects five to eight per cent of school-age children worldwide and is associated with age-inappropriate problems with attention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that can impair everyday functioning. Stimulant medications improve symptoms in 70 per cent of those who take them in the short term but there is less evidence of their long-term effects.\n\nTo provide an alternative to medication researchers have developed and trialled approaches that use non-invasive stimulation of the brain, working on the regions that have been identified as influential in ADHD.\n\nOne of these approaches involves stimulating the trigeminal nerve (TNS), targeting a branch of this facial nerve which is thought to activate the brainstem and from there other brain regions that may be relevant to ADHD, in particular the locus coeruleus, which plays a role in arousal which is typically diminished in people with ADHD. TNS is thought to stimulate other brain regions associated with attention such as frontal and thalamic areas via the brainstem in a bottom-up manner.\n\nA previous small trial in the US with 62 children diagnosed with ADHD has shown that when TNS is applied every night for eight hours for one month it is effective in reducing symptoms – this research led to its clearance by the FDA for use in the US. However, the control condition involved no stimulation, and blinding was not tested after one month, raising questions about a potential placebo effect.\n\nThis new UK clinical trial across two sites in London and Southampton tested TNS in a wider range of 150 children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD aged between eight and 18 years old and applied a more rigorous placebo condition. Half of the sample received real TNS for about 9 hours every night for four weeks through battery-powered electrodes applied to the forehead. The other half of the sample received the ‘sham’ condition where electrodes were still applied to the forehead every night for four weeks but participants only received 30 seconds of stimulation every hour at a lower frequency and pulse width, which are thought to be non-effective and hence act as a “control” condition.\n\nOur study shows how important it is to design an appropriate placebo condition in clinical trials of brain therapies. There is a large placebo effect with high-tech brain therapies, in particular for patients and families that have an expectation that they can adjust brain differences associated with ADHD. It is hence paramount to control for placebo effects in modern brain therapies to avoid false hopes.\n\nDr Aldo Conti, postdoctoral researcher at IoPPN and at Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care, King’s College London and first author on the study said: “This multicentre trial was designed to address key limitations of the previous pilot study that informed FDA clearance of TNS for ADHD, particularly by using a rigorously controlled sham condition that supported successful blinding across the treatment period. Unlike the earlier study, which was limited to younger children, we also included adolescents, a clinically important group given well-documented challenges with long-term medication adherence. These design choices enabled a more robust and clinically relevant evaluation of TNS.”\n\nThe trial showed that TNS was safe with no serious adverse events and most participants considered it a mild or no burden to use. However, the results showed no significant change in ADHD symptoms, objective measures of hyperactivity, attention and associated behaviours around mood and sleep.\n\nProfessor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at University of Southampton and study lead for the Southampton site, stated: “Rigorous evidence, such as that generated by this study, is essential for supporting shared decision-making regarding interventions for ADHD. It empowers individuals with ADHD and their families to make informed choices about the treatment of ADHD. Clinicians, individuals with ADHD, and their families need to know which treatments work, and which do not based on the best evidence.”\n\nThe trial was run by the King’s Clinical Trials Unit and recruitment involved the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) clinics within the following NHS trusts: South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare (previously known as SOLENT NHS Trust), Central and North-West London NHS Foundation Trust, Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust and South-West London and St. George’s Mental Health NHS Trust.\n\nExternal trigeminal nerve stimulation in youth with ADHD: a randomized, sham-controlled, phase 2b trial by Conti, A.A. et al was published in Nature Medicine. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-04075-x\n\nProfessor of Cognitive Neuroscience\n\nPostdoctoral Research Associate",

    "fullText": "The Oklahoma Sooners closed the 2025 season with a loss in the College Football Playoff to the Alabama Crimson Tide, a team they beat earlier in the season in Tuscaloosa. And the AP voters punished them for it, dropping the Sooners from No. 8 in the College Football Playoff rankings to No. 13 in the final AP Poll for 2025.\n\nOklahoma fell behind Alabama, Notre Dame, BYU, and Texas. The Crimson Tide were dominated by national champion Indiana in the Rose Bowl. Notre Dame opted out of the Pop Tarts Bowl, and BYU and Texas won their respective exhibition non-playoff games.\n\nThe Sooners may have finished the season with a loss, but proved they were one of the 10 best teams in college football in 2025. Alabama being in front of Oklahoma is understandable. So is Texas, since they beat the Sooners in the Red River Showdown. But it doesn't make sense to drop Oklahoma behind Notre Dame or BYU.\n\nNotre Dame shouldn't get rewarded for opting out of a bowl game cause they were sad they missed the playoff. BYU was proven even more fraudulent by Texas Tech's shutout loss to the Oregon Ducks. The Cougars' only losses on the season came to the Red Raiders, and BYU lost in decisive fashion.\n\nIt's just more disrespect for a Sooners team that earned its way into the No. 8 seed of the College Football Playoff by rattling off road wins over Tennessee and Alabama before beating Missouri and LSU with dominant defensive performances.\n\nOklahoma's been aggressive this offseason to upgrade their offense and retool their defense, and now the AP has provided fuel for the fire to make a return trip to the College Football Playoff in 2026.\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions.

    "fullText": "With the book officially closed on the 2025 college football season and a new national champion having been crowned, it is now time to shift our focus to the 2026 college football season. It's never too early for that, right? As is typically the case when the season comes to a close, the tradition of way-too-early top-25 projections are making the rounds already, and one of the more interesting teams to scout on these lists will be Penn State.\n\nFollowing a program-changing 2025 season with an in-season coaching change and the hiring of Matt Campbell to steer the ship back on course, and with a massive offseason roster overhaul as a result, Penn State may be a difficult team for many to accurately project in the 2026 season. But that will not stop anyone from attempting to gauge where the Nittany Lions will be sitting next season. If one way-too-early top-25 list from On3 is any indication, Penn State could be on the College Football Playoff bubble next fall.\n\nOn3 released its way-too-early top-25 list and gave Penn State a No. 14 projection. Putting Penn State somewhere in the middle of any top-25 projection feels somewhat fair given the changes wiht the program and puts some trust in Campbell to turn things around from Penn State's 2025 season. It also feels like a pretty safe projection to suggest Penn State could be in the playoff hunt but may fall just outside of it.\n\nOhio State tops the On3 top-25 outlook, followed by Georgia, Texas, and Notre Dame, respectively. 2025 national champion Indiana takes the No. 5 slot in the On3 way-too-early top-25, with Oregon right behind the Hoosiers to give the Big Ten three top-10 teams in this projection. Michigan is the only other Big Ten team ranked ahead of Penn State, at No. 11.\n\nOther Big Ten teams ranked in On3's early projection are Washington (No. 18), USC (No. 19), and Iowa (No. 21). Penn State will play road games next season at Michigan and Washington and will host USC. The Nittany Lions will not face Ohio State, Indiana, or Oregon during the regular season in 2026. Also of note, On3 also ranks Virginia Tech, now coached by former Penn State head coach James Franklin, at No. 23.\n\nFollow Kevin McGuire on Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.\n\nFollow Nittany Lions Wire on X, Facebook, and Threads.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: Where Penn State ranks in On3's way-too-early top 25 for 2026 season",

    "fullText": "Undefeated teams in college football history: Here's a list of every perfect national champion all time originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCollege football tends to thrive on chaos.\n\nUpsets are what makes the sport so captivating at times — when a smaller school topples a national power, it reminds fans what they enjoy so much about the landscape of NCAA football. But while upsets are fun, there are sometimes teams that are simply too dominant to overcome.\n\nCollege football has had its share of teams to go unbeaten across an entire season, some of which also claimed a win in that year's national championship. Some undefeated squads didn't get the opportunity to play for the title, while others steamrolled their way to college football glory, whether in the College Football Playoff, Bowl Championship Series or other previous playoff systems.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of the history of undefeated college football teams, including national champions.\n\nMORE: Which teams have the most wins in college football history?\n\nWith college football having a complicated history within its structure, there a few ways to view the history of undefeated teams — regardless of whether they won a national championship or not. In total, there have likely been hundreds teams to finish a college football season unbeaten, but with varying circumstances, tiebreaker and playoff rules and number of games.\n\nPre-1900, when college football was still free of ties and informal with plenty of differing rules, the NCAA has 26 teams on-record to finish their season unbeaten and untied, per the NCAA's 2009 Division I records report, which included any teams with a minimum of five games against opponents above the high school level. From 1900 to 1936, the year the AP Poll was introduced, there were an additional 133 teams to finish a season unbeaten and untied.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1991, the year before the Bowl Coalition was created — helping to better establish a national champion and provide better-quality bowl matchups — the NCAA has 134 teams on-record to finish a season unbeaten and untied.\n\nFrom 1992-2013, which spans between the Bowl Coalition, Bowl Alliance and Bowl Championship Series eras of the postseason, the NCAA has 40 teams on-record to go unbeaten and untied.\n\nHowever, in terms of comparing college football teams, it's easiest to assess the unbeaten teams in the College Football Playoff era, since 2014. Because this playoff format is still used by the NCAA, allows top teams to go head-to-head in the playoff, and limits the number of unbeaten squads, it's the easiest way to assess a \"perfect\" team in recent history.\n\nIn the CFP era, there have been seven FBS teams to go unbeaten in a full season, six of which won the CFP championship. A 13-0 USF team in 2017, which was not selected to the playoff bracket, is the lone non-champion.\n\nTrimming the parameters from 1994-2025, which largely covers the most modern era of college football, there have been a total of 30 FBS teams to go undefeated in a season. Nebraska had three (1994, 1995, 1997), while 11 of those 30 teams did not with the national championship, for varying reasons.\n\nOverall, the history of unbeaten teams is a complicated one, especially when looking at non-national champions. With the CFP in place, the era of multiple undefeated teams in one season is virtually obsolete, helping to quiet those complications. For years, there were consistently undefeated teams that didn't get a shot at the championship, including 1998 Tulane, 2004 Auburn, 2006 Boise State, 2008 Utah and 2010 TCU.\n\nExamining the history of undefeated teams to win the national championship is a bit more defined — while there have been many college football teams to finish a season unbeaten, especially in the early eras of the sport, a more select few have gone unbeaten with a title.\n\nMORE: Most losses in college football history by school\n\nSince 1936, the year the Associated Press released its first Top 25 poll, there have been 64 NCAA-recognized undefeated college football champions. That includes co-title holders.\n\nNotre Dame has six of those perfect championship seasons, while Nebraska and Alabama both have five.\n\nHere's the list of every undefeated national champion, separated by era (CFP, BCS, pre-BCS), according to the NCAA.\n\nMORE:What to know about college football overtime rules\n\nIn January of 2026, Indiana became the most recent undefeated college football team.\n\nPrior to Indiana, the last college football team to finish a season undefeated was the Michigan Wolverines in 2023. Led by head coach John Harbaugh and quarterback J.J. McCarthy, the Big Ten squad went 15-0 and won the College Football Playoff championship over Washington. Michigan's 2023 season resulted in controversy over a sign-stealing scandal, however.\n\nHarbaugh, in his ninth season at Michigan, guided his team to a 12-0 regular season in 2023. The Wolverines then beat Iowa 26-0 in the Big Ten Championship game and took down Alabama 27-20 in overtime of the Rose Bowl, a CFP semifinal game. To win the national title, Michigan beat Washington 34-13, winning the 12 title in program history and first since 1997.\n\nMichigan became the first national champion to have a lead at halftime in every game it played since 2001 Miami. Harbaugh's unit also became the first-ever Big Ten team to go 15-0. Outside of McCarthy, key contributors included guard Zak Zinte, running back Blake Corum, tight end Colston Loveland, defensive lineman Mason Graham and cornerbacks Mike Sainristil and Will Johnson.\n\nThere were a few reasons for controversy around Michigan's 2023 season, though. For one, Harbaugh had been suspended by his university for the first three games of the season due to alleged recruiting violations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, in November of the 2023 season, a sign-stealing scandal became apparent that gained national interests.\n\nIn October 2023, the NCAA began Michigan's football program amid allegations of sign-stealing, the Big Ten announced. The Wolverines were being accused of in-person scouting of future opponents. In early November, staffer Connor Stalions resigned due to his role in the schemes, while Harbaugh was suspended by the Big Ten for the team's final three regular-season games for violating sportsmanship rules.\n\nEventually, the NCAA's investigation officially found in 2025 that Michigan's football program had \"committed violations involving an off-campus, in-person scouting scheme.\" Through interview testimonies, ticket receipts and transfer data and other evidence, Stalions was found to have made scouting violations.\n\n\"During the 2021, 2022 and 2023 football seasons, Stalions directed and arranged for individuals to conduct off-campus, in-person scouting of Michigan's future regular-season opponents. In doing so, Stalions purchased game tickets and transferred them to those individuals, who included another staff member, interns and acquaintances of Stalions. The network of individuals was referred to as the 'KGB.' While in attendance, they filmed the signal callers on the future opponents' sidelines and then provided that film to Stalions,\" the NCAA's report said. \"Using the footage they collected — which Stalions referred to as 'dirty film' — Stalions then deciphered opponents' signals. Stalions and other individuals involved in the scheme acknowledged or corroborated this process.\n\nAdditionally, on one occasion, Stalions personally attended a future opponent's contest. In total, 56 instances of off-campus, in-person scouting of 13 future regular- season opponents occurred across 52 contests.\"\n\nThe NCAA's report also said that Stalions had spent nearly $35,000 on tickets in 2022 alone for the scheme. It also reported that Stalions, Harbaugh, Sherrone Moore and former director of player personnel Denard Robinson all failed to meet \"expectations of cooperation\" in the investigation, ranging from \"destroying relevant materials\" to \"providing false and misleading information during interviews.\"\n\nPunishments for the scandal were also released by the NCAA. Then-Michigan head coach, Sherrone Moore, was suspended three games, Stalions received an eight-year show-cause penalty, Harbaugh received a 10-year show-cause, and a fine was expected to eclipse $30 million for the school, per ESPN.\n\nRegardless of that investigation and the noise in made in the college football world, the Wolverines continued their dominance into the CFP and completed a perfect season. After the title win, Harbaugh left the program to be the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers in the NFL, not dealing with many of the consequences that were handed to the program from the sign-stealing scandal.\n\nMORE:Explaining the 2025 Sherrone Moore scandal at Michigan\n\nTwo teams have gone 16-0 in college football history: Indiana in 2025 and Yale in 1984. While Yale football team accomplished the feat. in 1984, thought, there are plenty of reasons to take that feat with a bit of an asterisk.\n\nThere wasn't just no CFP or no officially recognized national champions in 1894 — there was minimal padding for players and no helmets. It was a much different sport in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\nSince then, there have been a number of teams to go 15-0, but going 16-0 often hasn't been a possibility due to the length of the regular season, or the playoff format. If you count the FCS, there has been one other 16-0 team: North Dakota State in 2019.\n\nWith the creation of the 12-team CFP in 2024, it became possible for an FBS team to play 16 games between the regular season, their conference championship and the playoff bracket. In January 2026, the Indiana Hoosiers joined 1894 Yale as the only 16-0 teams in college football history.\n\nMORE: The full list of biggest blowouts in CFP history",

    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Carson Beck was part of two national championship runs at Georgia.\n\nTo him, those seasons weren't as good as this one was for him at Miami.\n\nBeck's last pass as a college quarterback was an interception, one that essentially sealed Miami's fate in a 27-21 loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff national championship game on Monday night. He had to watch the Hoosiers celebrate on what was his home field, watch the turf littered in crimson-and-white confetti.\n\nAnd yet, when he reflected on the end of his journey, he declared this year at Miami the best of his life.\n\n“Yeah, it was,” Beck said after a 19-for-32 passing, 232-yard, one-touchdown, one-interception performance in the final. “And not because we made the national championship, not because won a bunch of football games or we made great plays or things of that sort. Man, for me, my whole entire life changed.\n\n\"You know, 365 days ago, I was in just a really dark place, and I was trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It was a really difficult thing. There was just a lot going on, mentally, physically, emotionally, to be able to battle and fight through the roller-coaster that life is.\"\n\nAt this time a year ago, Beck was no longer wanted at Georgia, his elbow had just been surgically rebuilt, every move of his personal life became social-media fodder and he knew the doubters were everywhere.\n\nHe almost got the last laugh. Beck started all 16 games for Miami, led the Hurricanes to a 13-3 mark and set a school record by completing 72.4% of his passes. The last pass was a bit underthrown, and there seemed to be some sort of miscommunication on the final play. (“Their defense played really well tonight,\" Beck said.) But Miami knew long before that play that without Beck, they wouldn't have gotten anywhere near the CFP title game.\n\n“He earned the respect of his teammates, teammates working hard with him,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “We win together, we lose together. Proud of him.”\n\nBeck was at Miami for one year. He made clear after his final college game that whatever the future brings, he'll have the Hurricanes to thank.\n\n“I really couldn’t have done it without all these people around me,” Beck said. “This university truly saved me and helped me rebuild into the man that I am today.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS — The field was covered in red-and-white confetti, and the Heisman Trophy quarterback was covered in bruises. The college football season had just come down to the very final minute, and a team of perpetual sorrow was dancing toward glory.\n\nThis is what it looks like when reality surpasses fantasy.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana, emerging from a century of gloom, won the College Football Playoff national championship game, 27-21, against No. 10 Miami on Monday night in what feels like a seismic shift in possibilities for forgotten programs everywhere.\n\nWere they watching Monday night in Starkville, Mississippi?\n\nHow about in Ames, Iowa? Maybe even in the shadow of a new campus stadium in Tampa?\n\n“We’re 16-0 and national champions at Indiana University,” head coach Curt Cignetti said. “I know a lot of people thought that was never possible. It’s probably one of the greatest sports stories of all time.”\n\nThe Hoosiers, a team that had not won a conference championship in nearly 60 years and was more than 200 games below .500 before Cignetti arrived in 2024, went 16-0 and won the national championship just two years after going 3-9. If that kind of turnaround is possible in the new world of college football, can any dream be considered too outlandish in the days to come?\n\nQuarterback Fernando Mendoza, who grew up just miles from Hard Rock Stadium and was all but ignored by his beloved University of Miami as a Columbus High senior, played a virtually flawless game despite a fierce pass rush from the Hurricanes.\n\n“Tonight is going to be an insane night,” Mendoza said during the onfield trophy presentation. “I can’t wait to get back to Bloomington with the guys.”\n\nThere was nothing accidental about what Indiana accomplished this season. The record was perfect, and it was absolutely a reflection of the team’s play.\n\nThe Hoosiers were disciplined (fifth in the nation in penalties per game), they were explosive (second in points per game), they were stingy (second in points allowed per game) and they were smart (first in turnover margin).\n\nThey beat defending national champion Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game, and then crushed Alabama and Oregon by a combined 94-25 in their first two playoff games. All that stood in Indiana’s way was a Miami team that defied projections with upsets of higher-seeded teams in the first two rounds of the playoffs before dispatching Ole Miss in the semifinals.\n\nThe Hoosiers controlled the ball and frustrated the Hurricanes in the first half, and then came up with clutch plays on offense and special teams in the second half as Miami staged a furious comeback.\n\nAnd, in the end, Indiana’s fearlessness was the difference.\n\nAfter Miami had cut the lead to 17-14, the Hoosiers answered with a touchdown drive for the ages. It wasn’t that they held the ball for 12 plays or that they traveled 75 yards. It was that Cignetti put faith in his quarterback on a fourth and 5 instead of punting from the Miami 37, and then again on fourth down from the Miami 4. On the first conversion, Mendoza hit Charlie Becker on a 19-yard, back-shoulder completion. That was just the appetizer.\n\nOn fourth down from the 4, Indiana initially called the field-goal unit on the field. After a timeout, Cignetti sent the offense back out and Mendoza, on a quarterback draw, bounced off defenders and dove into the endzone for the touchdown.\n\n“They called that play and we knew, ‘Hey, we’re going to bet on ourselves one more time in the biggest (moment) of the game,’” Mendoza said.\n\nIn a way, this is what so many fans wanted. A college football postseason with the suspense of an NCAA basketball tournament.\n\nAlabama, Clemson, Georgia and Ohio State had become as ubiquitous in January as Dick Clark and Times Square. From 2014-22, there was not a single national championship game without at least one of those teams. And six of those games included some variation of two of those programs playing each other.\n\nThat’s the hierarchy the transfer portal torched. And this is the future that name, image and likeness money has begat.\n\nMiami, on Monday night, was playing in a national title game for the first time in 23 years. The last time Indiana had even a whiff of national title consideration was when the Hoosiers lost 14-3 to No. 1 USC in the 1968 Rose Bowl and finished No. 4 in the final Associated Press poll.\n\nIt’s a new era of college football.\n\nIt’s not perfect, by any means. It’s not beloved by traditionalists aghast with players jumping from school to school, and it’s practically blasphemous for programs accustomed to sitting atop the mountaintop.\n\nBut, as the 2025 season demonstrated, there is something exhilarating about the unknown. Something thrilling about new faces and stories.\n\nSomething remarkable about a program that could endure 26 losing seasons in 30 years and, with a new coach on board, emerge to go 27-2 across his first two seasons and win a national championship.\n\nWelcome to the new world order.\n\nJohn Romano can be reached at jromano@tampabay.com.

    "fullText": "Carson Beck will have plenty of fond memories to look back on from his college football career.\n\nBut it ended Monday in heartbreak.\n\nWith a chance to lead Miami on a drive for its sixth national championship, Beck threw an interception that sealed Indiana's first. His intended target on the play, Keelan Marion, never saw the ball in the air.\n\nWith the clock ticking under two minutes, Miami's defense held Indiana to a field goal that gave the Hoosiers a 27-21 lead. Beck then led the offense onto the field with 1:42 remaining, in need of a touchdown that could seal a national title on Miami's home field.\n\nMiami overcame a delay of game penalty before the first snap with a pair of first downs that put them over midfield. The first first down of the drive arrived courtesy of a roughing the passer penalty that resulted in the back of Beck's head hitting the turf.\n\nWith the Hurricanes facing first and 10 at the Indiana 41, Beck decided to go for it all with 51 seconds remaining. Marion ran a go route down the left sideline, facing man coverage from cornerback Jamari Sharpe and safety help over the top.\n\nBeck launched a deep ball that never stood a chance.\n\njamari sharpe game sealing interception; miami vs indiana pic.twitter.com/ceKYojVw14\n\n— ◇ (@F0RGIAT0) January 20, 2026\n\nThe ball was short and thrown into double coverage. Sharpe pinpointed it for an interception at the 15-yard line as Marion continued to run toward the end zone.\n\nWith Miami out of timeouts, all that was left for the Hoosiers to clinch the national championship was to run out the clock. They did just that for a 27-21 win.\n\nAnd Beck will finish his college career with two national championships as a backup at Georgia, but none as a starter.\n\nThe turnover was the first of the night for either team on a night when Beck completed 19 of 32 passes for 232 yards with 1 touchdown and the late interception.\n\nBeck was asked after the game how he was feeling on the last drive after the roughing-the-passer hit.\n\n\"My ears are ringing,\" Beck said, per ESPN's Pete Thamel.\n\nBeck also spoke with reporters about the game-sealing interception.\n\nHere’s Carson Beck explaining the final interception. pic.twitter.com/COIrwqYO4C\n\n— Clay Ferraro (@ClayWPLG) January 20, 2026\n\n\"The guy made a really good play,\" Beck said. \"They were in cover 2 and he sunk with no flat threat, made a really good play on the ball.\n\n\"So again, a lot of credit to them and their defense. They played really, really well tonight.\"\n\nPer Thamel, Marion was in tears in the postgame locker room with a towel over his head. He said that the interception was his \"mistake\" and that he didn't realize that Beck had thrown the pass.\n\n\"I didn't even know he had threw the ball,\" Marion said. ... “I got to look for the ball and make that play for him. So that's all on me.”\n\nHere's a look at the Marion's route from the sideline near the end zone. Marion didn't look back for the ball until he crossed the 20-yard line after Sharpe had made his break on the ball. By then, it was too late.\n\nI see what Carson Beck saw here. Why is Keelan Marion running with his head down? I really don’t understand. pic.twitter.com/XopqjBbpVp\n\n— Miami Hurricanes 2026 National Champs 🏆 (@nijayforeverlit) January 20, 2026\n\nThe interception concludes a college career for Beck that started at Georgia in 2020 and featured five seasons including a redshirt campaign with the Bulldogs before he utilized his extra Covid-19 season to transfer to Miami.\n\nMiami didn't win the ACC with Beck at quarterback, but was granted a controversial berth in the College Football Playoff. Beck and the Hurricanes ultimately proved the selection committee correct by winning three playoff games to advance to Monday's championship game.\n\nThey had a chance at the end to upset a historic Indiana team that surged to the top of college football with dominant units on both sides of the ball following decades of irrelevance.\n\nIt's a lot to be proud of. But it's not likely to soothe the pain of how Monday's championship game was lost at the end.",

Indiana vs. Miami would be the 12th college football game he has attended since he was elected to his first term in 2016, and it would be the eighth he's attended as a sitting president.\n\nIn addition to attending the Army-Navy Game in December, Trump attended a Washington Commanders game against the Detroit Lions late in the NFL season and even made an appearance in the Fox broadcast booth. Last year, Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl.\n\nMiami, where Monday's game will be played, is a particularly convenient location for Trump because he has a residence at Mar-a-Lago in nearby Fort Lauderdale. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago on Friday and stayed there through the weekend, but he is set to return to the White House after the game.\n\nTrump is expected to attend the game with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who graduated from law school at Miami and represented Florida in the U.S. senate before being nominated to join Trump's cabinet.",

There’s also a wealth of present-day interviews with Saban and his wife, the legendary Ms. Terry Saban, whose own influence and impact played a massive role in Nick’s success as a coach and leader.”\n\nSaban retired two years ago from Alabama and now serves as an ESPN analyst – as well as a pitchman for Aflac and Vrbo.\n\n“With my coaching days behind me, Ms. Terry and I have been doing a lot of reflection and realized we were ready to tell our story,” Nick Saban said. “The team at Words + Pictures has encouraged me to really look back not just at my time at Alabama, but every stop along the way – and not just reflect on what happened but consider the process which made it happen. I interacted with a lot of players and coaches along the way and I’m happy to see that so many of them have contributed to this docuseries. There’s a lot to tell, and I’m excited to share it all.”\n\nIn addition to his national titles, Saban’s football programs produced four Heisman Trophy winners and innumerable NFL stars. ESPN says the series will include “more than 30 hours of interviews with Saban, and more than 80 interviews with former players, assistant coaches, rivals, family, friends, and observers, the series offers a rare look at how he became the most successful and influential figure that the game of college football has ever known.”\n\n“There will never be another Nick Saban,” observed Connor Schell, CEO of Words + Pictures. “He’s a football genius, a singular leader, and a true icon who has done more than anyone to shape the modern game of college football and the culture around it. When you work with Coach Saban, you’re constantly reminded how every small detail matters and, in his case, that attention to detail and process has added up to an incredible journey and legacy. Working with Coach Saban and Ms. Terry has been a tremendous experience, and we can’t wait to share their story with the world.”\n\nESPN says the premiere date and full rollout plans for the series will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Grammys, Tonys & More",

The Cyclones were blown out 84-63 on the road by Kansas before following that up with a 79-70 setback at Cincinnati four days later. The Commodores, meanwhile, lost by 16 on the road against Texas and fell 98-94 at home to reigning national champion Florida.\n\nNo. 1 Arizona continued its perfect start to the season, moving to 18-0 with wins against rival Arizona State and at UCF. No. 10 Nebraska, the only other unbeaten team from a power conference, also kept its unblemished record intact, drubbing Oregon and Northwestern by a combined 54 points.\n\nREQUIRED READING: NCAA tournament bracketology: Race for No. 1 seed leads March Madness projection\n\nThen there's the nation's unlikeliest undefeated squad, Miami (Ohio), which moved to 19-0 thanks to a 105-102 overtime thriller over Buffalo.\n\nWill it be enough to get the RedHawks ranked?
