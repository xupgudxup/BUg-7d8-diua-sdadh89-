    "fullText": "The demolition of Hawai’i’s Aloha Stadium is finally underway after several delays.\n\nOnce home to the NFL Pro Bowl, college football’s Hawaiʻi Bowl and University of Hawaiʻi football, Aloha Stadium is transitioning into a new scaled-down stadium with an accompanying entertainment district.\n\nAs part of the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District (NASED) project, the new stadium is set for a projected grand opening in March 2029, and is expected to have a seating capacity of 22,500, less than half of the previous 50,000 seats it held.\n\n“The demolition/dismantling of Aloha Stadium has begun,” Aloha Stadium Authority chairman Eric Fujimoto said at the NASED monthly meeting on Dec. 18. The removal of furnishings and the subsequent dismantling of the facility are expected to take approximately 10 months.\n\nThe beginning of the demolition process marks a major milestone for a plan that has been repeatedly delayed. The reopening of the stadium was initially scheduled to be on time for the Rainbow Warriors’ football season in 2028, but was pushed back to 2029 in August of this year.\n\nBefore its final closing after years of maintenance issues, Aloha Stadium was an innovative steel-constructed venue with movable seating sections for different sports and events.\n\nHowever, the stadium, also known as the Metal Mecca, met its downfall because of that very design structure.\n\nThe steel structure was not a good match for Hawai’i’s humid climate, which led to severe, damaging rust that required frequent repairs.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the stadium with a costly history was put to rest.\n\nWith the demolition now in full swing, attention turns to the broader vision of the NASED project. The construction of the new, smaller stadium and the surrounding entertainment district is expected to cost the state $350 million.\n\nThe new Aloha Stadium’s entertainment district is expected to include 4,000 to 4,500 housing units, multiple hotels, retail and dining spaces and cultural attractions. Residential construction is projected to take place shortly after the opening of the newly renovated Aloha Stadium, as early as 2029 or 2030.\n\nDiego Rivera - The Sporting Tribune\n\nThe University of Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors celebrate linebacker Jalen Smith's (3) fumble recovery during an NCAA football game against the Utah State Aggies, Saturday, October 11, 2025.\n\nAfter playing its home games at the Clarence T.C. Ching Athletics Complex since the closing of Aloha Stadium, University of Hawai’i football is set to move back into the new facility in 2029 under a license agreement negotiated with Hawai’i Athletics Director Matt Elliott.\n\n“While there is still much work ahead, the progress being made gives all of us reason to be optimistic,” Elliott said in a September press release. “We are excited to see momentum building and remain committed to doing our part to bring this long-awaited vision to life.”\n\nAs demolition progresses and construction plans take shape, the NASED project ushers in a new era for Hawai’i sports.",

    "title": "Letters to Sports: Playing the blame game in USC-Notre Dame debacle",
    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section share their thoughts on the USC-Notre Dame rivalry, the Rams, UCLA, Angels and college football.",
    "fullText": "Bill Plaschke writes, “If the Trojans truly want to return to greatness, being selected for the CFP is the goal. Not beating Notre Dame. Not even beating UCLA.” That's 100% wrong.\n\nAs a USC alum (1965) and longtime fan, those are the only things that do matter. I have often said that if USC beats UCLA or Notre Dame, the coach deserves another season. To give up this grand tradition in pursuit of the arguably artificial and profit-driven CFP would be an unforgivable sin.\n\nA USC national football championship without playing Notre Dame rings hollow — an asterisked title, a meal that never satisfies, a taste you can’t quite wash away. It may shine in the record books, but it will always feel unfinished to those who know what real college football tradition demands. Earth to Lincoln Riley: an undefeated season is still a loss without playing the Fighting Irish. What’s next? If UCLA becomes competitive, then there will be no crosstown game?\n\nSo the Fighting Irish own a series edge of 53-37, have won 3 in a row, 7 of the last 8, and 11 of the last 15 games. Yet Bill Plaschke now claims that Notre Dame is running away from the series and is afraid of \"Ole SC.\" To paraphrase the late, great Jim Healy, Plaschke is on the Leonard Tose highway!\n\nNotre Dame is the Burger King of college football — always having it their way. From backdoor deals with the corrupt [CFP] guaranteeing a playoff spot if they finish ranked in the top 12 to refusing to join a conference so that they can pocket all bowl game money, the Irish are treated like college football royalty. Glad USC told the Irish toddlers they can’t have ice cream for breakfast!\n\n“USC and Notre Dame recognize how special our rivalry is to our fans …\" A joint statement by the athletic directors of the two schools. Really? Fake news!\n\nNo USC-Notre Dame football game! Who’s next to be cut from the Notre Dame football schedule, Navy? Oh wait, the Irish can’t afford to drop Navy. That might hurt their chance$ at a playoff berth.\n\nI don't think firing the Rams' special teams coach is the answer. How about running some tackling drills with the defensive backs during the week. I know there's \"no crying in baseball,\" but is it now \"there's no tackling in football?\" Throw in some deep coverage drills too!\n\nSo it looks like athletic director Martin Jarmond has forced UCLA followers to accept his decisions made outside of public scrutiny once again with a contract extension for Mick Cronin. If you haven’t noticed, UCLA basketball has been sliding into mediocrity. Seats at home games are increasingly vacant. USC is outrecruiting UCLA. Prices for seats would make you think you are going to see a top-tier team. UCLA has been sitting on distant memories. How long will it take to fully trash those memories? Jarmond’s easy-way-out decision is dooming the basketball program.\n\nHaving been a Kings fan since Luc Robitaille's rookie year, I have seen some very good Kings teams and some very bad ones. But never have I seen a team with so much potential and skill be so absolutely lethargic and unwatchable this season. This team currently ranks 31st out of 32 teams in overall scoring and power-play percentage. How bad is it? As of Christmas Eve, in the last 5 games the team has a total of 8 goals and 8 assists, or 16 points, the sum total of all 18 skaters on the ice over 5 games. Connor McDavid, the leading NHL scorer, has racked up 15 points in his last 5 games … just one skater. The saying goes that the fish rots from the head. Time to show coach Jim Hiller and his entire staff the door. A fresh start, a new motivator. Is Darryl Sutter available again?\n\nRonald J Peters\nColorado Springs, Colo.\n\nIn his Dec. 22 analysis, Bill Shaikin implies that payroll is the difference between winning and losing baseball teams. For the Angels, the on-field problems are rooted in off-the-field issues that have gone largely unchecked for at least a decade. As Angel fans, we can only hope that the settling of the Tyler Skaggs lawsuit, a low 2026 payroll, and one-year contracts to the GM and manager indicate that Arte Moreno is readying the Angels for sale. New ownership and upper management are what’s needed, not a higher payroll.\n\nIt was fitting that rapper 50 Cent performed live during Oklahoma’s first-round College Football Playoff loss, since the Sooners basically showed up for only two quarters.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

    "description": "As we close out 2025, why not look back at an excellent year of college and amateur golf.",
    "fullText": "Another year of college and amateur golf is in the books.\n\nAs the year winds down, it's time to look back at some of the best moments throughout the year in the college and amateur game. Whether it was teenagers breaking out on a national stage or established players making history in their own journey, it was an exciting year for fans who follow golf up-and-coming stars.\n\nLet's take a look back at some of the biggest stories of the year, starting with perhaps the biggest breakout of them all.\n\nFirst, Howell won medalist honors at a U.S. Open qualifier to earn his first major championship start. Then he won medalist honors at the U.S. Junior Amateur. That wasn't enough. He got into the U.S. Amateur match-play bracket via a playoff and proceeded to win the biggest amateur championship in the world and represented the U.S. on the Walker Cup team, going 2-1. Mason Howell is here.\n\nAs time goes on, we'll be able to look at this result and truly measure its significance in the sport, but Northwestern knocking off No. 1 Stanford in the championship match at the NCAA Women's Golf Championship is arguably the biggest upset in women's college golf history. Anything can happen in match play, and Northwestern pulled off the miraculous win for its first championship in school history.\n\nIt's hard to describe what an incredible week it was at the Walker Cup. Cypress Point is one of the cathedrals of golf in the entire world, ranked No.1 on Golfweek's Best list of Classic Courses in the U.S., and it was a perfect venue for many of the best amateurs in the U.S. and Great Britain & Ireland to battle it out. The crowds were spectacular, sights breathtaking and Cypress Point got to show off in primetime. Hard to find how it wasn't an unforgetable week for players and fans alike.\n\nFrom one Pacific coast beauty to another, Bandon Dunes was spectacular theater for the 2025 U.S. Women's Amateur, but perhaps it's fitting that Megha Ganne found a way to come out on top. She's long been a star in the game of golf, but her triumph at Bandon Dunes was her crowning achievement on one of the biggest stages in golf. She was spectacular all week in Oregon and got to hoist the trophy after a dominant week.\n\nLuke Clanton was a professional for more than half the year, but the first five months of 2025 belonged to Clanton in the amateur game. The former No. 1 earned his PGA Tour card thanks to his play in those events, and he also dominated at the collegiate level, winning the Ben Hogan Award and nearly claiming the Fred Haskins, too. Now, it seems he's due for his first PGA Tour win in 2026.\n\nFrom one former Florida State No. 1 amateur to another, Woad was a constant presence near the top of leaderboards all year. So much so, that she won the Women's Irish Open as an amateur and then finished third at the Amundi Evian Championship, locking up her LPGA card and turning pro the next week. And then guess what? She went and won the women's Scottish Open. She won the 2024 Augusta National Women's Amateur to put her on the map, but she was destined to be a star long before.\n\nAnd how did Woad get her card? LEAP is how. The program, which is similar to PGA Tour University in that college players earn points based on finishes in top college and amateur events to provide a pathway directly to the Tour, had a stellar debut with Woad earning her card after the third-place finish at the Amundi Evian. Don't be surprised to see Kiara Romero earn her LPGA card via the same pathway in 2026.\n\nThere was a college golfer who made Division II history this fall. Drew Zielinski, a senior at Lee University, won the Golfweek Fripp Island to Bermuda Invitational, becoming the first player to win a D-II event that offered an exemption into a PGA Tour event. He later played in the Butterfield Bermuda Championship, where he finished T-15 in the field in birdies made but just missed the cut.\n\nTwo golfers at Purdue Fort Wayne jumped into an icy pond to save a man from drowning. What an incredible story of heroism.\n\nNiel Phillips had a day he will never forget in October. He aced the same hole not once, but twice in the same day. Phillips began the first round on Monday on the 182-yard hole, and he pulled a 6-iron and made it on his first shot of the day. He shot even-par 72 in the opening round before returning to the eighth hole in the afternoon for the second shotgun start of the day. This time, he hit a 7-iron. Different club, same result. His second ace in about 6 hours in the same spot where he made the first one.\n\nSeve. Jose Maria. Sergio. Jon. Carla. Carla Bernat Escuder added her name to the list of Spanish legends who have won at Augusta National, becoming the first woman from Spain to win the Augusta National Women's Amateur.\n\nIt's coming. A 59 in a college golf event is going to happen soon, possibly in the spring. It happened early this year in a practice round, with Utah's Sergio Jimenez accomplishing the feat. But how long until it happens in competition?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Looking back at the best moments from college and amateur golf in 2025",

    "fullText": "Despite a three-game win streak going into the Christmas break, the Florida Gators continue to drop in the ESPN College Basketball Power Index.\n\nLast ranked No. 11 following a win over George Washington, Florida fell one spot to No. 12 after decisive wins over Saint Francis and Colgate — both considered Quadrant 4 matchups by the NET rankings.\n\nThe Gators have a 19.0 overall BPI, up from 18.5 on Dec. 16. The offense improved to 8.8 (20th) from 8.0 (24th), while the Florida defense dipped to 10.2 (T-10th) from 10.3 (8th) in that time. ESPN projects Florida to go 21.5-9.5 overall — a 0.5-game increase — and 12.5-5.5 in conference play, a 0.4-game improvement.\n\n“The College Basketball Power Index (BPI) is a measure of team strength that is meant to be the best predictor of performance going forward,” ESPN explains. “BPI represents how many points above or below average a team is. Strength of Record (SOR) is a measure of team accomplishment based on how difficult a team’s W-L record is to achieve. Game predictions account for opponent strength, pace of play, site, travel distance, day’s rest and altitude, and are used to simulate the season 10,000 times to produce season projections.”\n\nFlorida remains the favorite to win the SEC, with 41% odds — up from 38.2% chance last week. The Vanderbilt Commodores (29%) and Tennessee Volunteers (21.3%) have the next best odds to win the conference, followed by Alabama Crimson Tide (15%) and Kentucky (14%). No other SEC team has better than a 4.4% chance to win the conference.\n\nFlorida's remaining strength of schedule is now 24th in the country, up from 44th before a three-game stretch against Quadrant 4 opponents. Florida still has Dartmouth on the schedule, and then it's all SEC from there. The Gators' strength of schedule (to date) ranks fifth in the country, while the non-conference slate ranks sixth nationally.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida Gators basketball ESPN BPI rankings Dec. 26",

    "title": "'This s*** is crazy' — Baylor's addition of James Nnaji further blurs line between pro and college hoops",
    "description": "The combination of schools looking for players outside the traditional recruiting realm and judges eroding the NCAA’s ability to enforce eligibility rules has led everyone here, whether they like it or not.",
    "fullText": "It’s rare for a college basketball story to enter the mainstream sports conversation on Christmas Eve, but Baylor’s announcement that it had added center James Nnaji — the 31st pick in the 2023 NBA Draft – was enough of a “What are we doing here?” moment for it to break through.\n\nThough college sports is now professional in almost every sense — including players who have signed pro contracts in Europe and the NBA G League finding their way to college basketball this year — the Nnaji development feels like new territory. This isn’t someone who slipped through the cracks or got bad advice, turned pro out of high school and ran into a career dead end. Nnaji, who has been playing in Europe, was one draft slot away from being a first-round pick with a guaranteed NBA contract. He played in the NBA Summer League and has even been part of a trade.\n\n“Santa Claus is delivering mid season acquisitions…this s*** is crazy!!” UConn coach Dan Hurley wrote on X shortly after the news became public.\n\nIs this really the type of player who should be part of college basketball? Who knows, maybe Arizona can get LeBron James on the bench for its Final Four push if he wants to play with his son Bryce.\n\nThat would be absurd, of course — and, to be clear, expressly against NCAA rules since these pro-to-college cases must take place within five years of high school — but you can be forgiven if it seems like anything goes these days.\n\nAnd guess what? As more college programs pursue mid-year additions, some have even checked in with G League players on two-way contracts who have appeared in actual NBA games. That seems inevitable at some point, too, given where this trend seems to be headed.\n\nBut don’t blame Baylor or any program for pursuing those players.\n\nWhile you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in college sports who thinks this is a good development, schools are merely doing what the NCAA has given them the green light to do as it waits and hopes for some kind of antitrust protection from Congress that would allow for the actual enforcement of the rulebook rather than a mishmash of eligibility rulings.\n\nIt’s tempting to wail away on the NCAA’s ineffectiveness here, especially if you’re, say, a Kentucky fan who remembers when the NCAA denied Enes Kanter’s eligibility because he received $33,000 over his necessary living expenses from a pro team in Turkey. That seems picayune compared to what’s happening regularly now, where schools are arranging for far higher payments to European teams just to get players bought out of contracts so they can come to college.\n\nAt the same time, the NCAA is in an incredibly difficult spot. Their executives and attorneys understand that each time the line of demarcation moves, as it has here, it chips away at the NCAA’s ability to ensure college sports are played by college students, not people who bypassed that opportunity and want to suddenly turn back because NIL has become so lucrative.\n\nBut the NCAA also sees a legal environment with a deluge of eligibility cases, with some judges granting sixth and seventh years to players. Gonzaga’s Tyon Grant-Foster, who will turn 26 before the NCAA tournament, was originally denied eligibility but granted a preliminary injunction in Washington to play this season — seven years after he enrolled in junior college.\n\nNCAA officials would argue nothing major has changed from a policy standpoint; rather, what’s different is the willingness of schools to recruit and enroll those players — and, of course, the willingness of those players to come play college basketball. Before there was big NIL money involved, it just wouldn’t have been something to consider. Now, it’s often a far more lucrative path than trying to make it to the NBA from the G League.\n\nThe combination of schools looking for players outside the traditional recruiting realm and judges eroding the NCAA’s ability to enforce eligibility rules has led everyone here, whether they like it or not.\n\nSports attorney Darren Heitner theorized Friday in his “Newsletter, Image, Likeness” blog on the legal landscape in college sports that this could also be part a calculated strategy by the NCAA to present college basketball as “one option within a broader professional and semi-professional basketball market that includes the G League, international leagues and other alternatives” to make the argument that the NCAA isn’t a monopoly.\n\n“If the NCAA can establish through these eligibility decisions that college basketball and professional leagues occupy the same competitive labor market, it will fundamentally reshape the antitrust analysis in ongoing and future cases,” Heitner wrote.\n\nThe question, though, is to what end? Is the point of this enterprise now merely about legal survival while college basketball transforms into a place for guys stuck in the NBA developmental system to come and get a big payday?\n\nThat doesn’t seem right. And even if the NCAA can get some kind of protection from Congress — it’s been six years and counting since the organization started down that path, so no guarantees there — it’s hard to imagine some of this stuff just comes to a hard stop. Once the window opens this wide, it’s difficult to close.\n\nMaybe it’s time for college basketball and the NBA to sit down and figure out a different model, one that perhaps mimics hockey’s system where players can be drafted but play in college until they decide to sign with their pro team.\n\nImagine a world where nobody has to enter the NBA Draft, they’re just automatically in the pool of draft-eligible players the year they turn 18 years old. At that point, decisions about what’s best for their development would take place collectively between the NBA franchise that drafted them and their college team. Perhaps you could even construct a system where a drafted player can join the NBA or G League team on a provisional basis after the college season and then go back to college if they feel like they need another year.\n\nOf course that would require a lot of work, cooperation and collective bargaining changes on the NBA side. But it makes a lot more sense than college coaches who need another body to bypass a high school kid and instead recruit a grown man who never intended to go to college with a six-figure payday.\n\nIf they’re simply going to wait around for Congress to deliver guardrails, Nnaji is going to be the first of many former NBA Draft picks to find their way back to college basketball and make the NCAA look like it has no rules at all.",

    "description": "If Whittingham does take the Michigan job, it could have a ripple effect throughout college football in the state of Utah.",
    "fullText": "It’s been a whirlwind two weeks for the University of Utah after Kyle Whittingham stepped down as head coach.\n\nAfter stepping down at Utah, the 66-year-old Whittingham continued to keep his options open, and on Friday, ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that Whittingham and Michigan are progressing toward a deal to make the longtime Ute Michigan’s new head coach.\n\nWhittingham’s deal with Michigan is expected to be finalized today, Thamel reported.\n\nIf Whittingham does take the Michigan job, it could have a ripple effect throughout college football in the state of Utah.\n\nWith the transfer portal opening on Jan. 2, Whittingham will quickly have to assemble his staff at Michigan.\n\nWhile Whittingham’s search for assistants will no doubt have a national reach, the former Utah coach has a notable coaching tree, and he could lean on his current and former assistant coaches while building a staff in Ann Arbor.\n\nHere are three notable names from Utah schools that Whittingham could potentially target while assembling a coaching staff.\n\nWhittingham is expected to target offensive coordinator Jason Beck for the same job at Michigan, according to CBS Sports’ Matt Zenitz.\n\nBeck turned around Utah’s offense in just one season, engineering the best year-to-year offensive improvement at Utah since at least 1996, according to the school.\n\nLed by mostly backup quarterbacks in 2024, Utah’s offense struggled, scoring 23.6 points per game (No. 102 in the nation) and totaling just 329.8 yards per game on offense (No. 115 in the nation).\n\nBeck, who was New Mexico’s offensive coordinator in 2024, brought quarterback Devon Dampier and receiver Ryan Davis from Albuquerque, and added running back Wayshawn Parker. Those new players, led by a veteran offensive line, injected much-needed life into Utah’s offense.\n\nBeck’s RPO-heavy scheme was run well by Dampier, and Utah’s offense scored 40.9 points per game (No. 5 in the nation) and rushed for 269.8 yards per game (No. 2 in the nation).\n\nBeck engineered one of the most successful offenses in the Whittingham era, so it would make sense that Whittingham would want continuity in Michigan, instead of starting fresh with a new offensive coordinator.\n\nOne of Whittingham’s first calls to his old staff at Utah would have to be to offensive line coach Jim Harding.\n\nHarding has been one of the top offensive line coaches in the nation during his time at Utah and did his best coaching job this season.\n\nWith a veteran group of returning starters, including tackles Spencer Fano and Caleb Lomu, Utah had one of the best offensive lines in the nation.\n\nThe Utes’ front five powered Utah to 3,237 rushing yards, just 27 yards off of breaking the school rushing record of 3,263, set in 1984.\n\nFano and Lomu are both potential first-round picks in this year’s NFL draft, with Fano considered the best offensive tackle available.\n\nThis summer, Harding landed a commitment from offensive tackle Kelvin Obot, who is Utah’s first-ever 247Sports composite five-star.\n\nHarding’s ability to recruit and develop talent on the offensive line has made him one of the country’s best position coaches and an attractive target for Whittingham’s staff at Michigan.\n\nJay Hill coached under Whittingham from 2005-2013 in various positions, including as Utah’s cornerbacks coach.\n\nHill left Utah in 2014 to become Weber State’s head coach, and in nine season in Ogden, Hill led the Wildcats to six playoff appearances.\n\nFollowing the 2022 season, Hill became Kalani Sitake’s defensive coordinator at BYU and turned around the Cougars’ defense.\n\nUnder Hill’s watch, BYU went from No. 96 in points allowed in 2022 (29.5 points per game) to No. 18 in 2024 (19.6 points per game) and No. 21 in 2025 (19 points per game).\n\nWith Whittingham’s connection to Hill, the current BYU defensive coordinator could be one of the top targets to call the Wolverines’ defense.",

    "description": "Justin Howells started at Target as a part-time hourly worker 23 years ago in San Diego and is now group vice president for the Pacific Northwest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Justin Howells, Target's group vice president for Pacific Northwest stores. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started as a Target team member 23 years ago, working part-time while attending college in San Diego.\n\nIt was not supposed to be a career — I just needed book money and some extra cash.\n\nOver time, I grew up, got married, had kids, and my career expanded. I've led stores, opened stores, and done everything in between, from that entry-level job to where I am now as group vice president for the Pacific Northwest, a role I've held for the last two years.\n\nThe core of what makes Target is our team.\n\nIt's like a small family in every building, and it's why I have stayed with the company as long as I have. There's a culture of development; a desire to teach and help you improve.\n\nNow, as a leader, I think it's important to let people get good at what they do.\n\nSometimes that takes time, but I've always appreciated an environment that allows me to learn from my mistakes as well as be good at what I'm currently working on.\n\nI've been really fortunate to work for a lot of people who don't just think about what I'm doing at the job. They care about how we're performing and what I'm adding to the company, but they've also cared about me as a person and my personal development.\n\nWe try to spend a lot of time talking to our team about what they want to achieve in their lives, and I think that's what has created such a stable structure within the teams I've worked for. It's the reason I stay.\n\nI enjoy retail, too. I like putting stuff on shelves and printing labels. To me, that's exciting. Other people might love to travel to other countries or be a teacher, but we need people for different things. I'm the person to help you find Tide and toothpaste.\n\nIn my view, the No. 1 rule is to have respect for everybody around you. Even now, I'll pick up trash off the floor. I'll clean the parking lot. Nobody is too good to do the job in front of you.\n\nIf you always have that mindset, you'll learn a lot from the people that you're working with.\n\nIt's also important to share what your dreams are and where you want to go in life.\n\nI started as a guy who pulled things forward on shelves every night of the week while I was in school, but I was always vocal about how I wanted to do the next thing. I told people I wanted to be a team leader, then I wanted to be an executive team leader, and then I wanted to be a store director.\n\nTalking about it and letting people know what your ambitions are is really important.\n\nAnd if you really want to go far in your career, continue to invest time and energy in the people around you.\n\nI don't pull things forward on shelves every night anymore; I have teams across multiple stores that do that for us, and I can't get anywhere without them.\n\nI never know when I might be standing next to a future group vice president who's putting away items in our stock room.\n\nWe keep the door open to everybody in case they might be interested in doing more.\n\nThey might have started because they thought, \"Hey, this is a good way for me to pay for books or bus money, but there's more for me in this company.\"\n\nThe possibilities are really endless if they're interested.",

    "description": "At Cincinnati College Prep, Jeff Cargile wants his students to succeed as much in the classroom as on the field. Get to know this football coach.",
    "fullText": "Jeff Cargile has been a beacon of hope for the Cincinnati College Prep Academy football team.\n\nIn four seasons, he's led the Lions to a 29-14 overall record, a three-peat of league titles and the school's first-ever regional semifinal appearance.\n\nBut the thing he's most proud of is that the team had a 3.1 grade-point average in the first quarter of this school year.\n\n\"Coaching football for me is more than just X's and O's. It's the life lessons that are taught along the way,\" Cargile wrote in an Oct. 19 Facebook post.\n\nHis coaching acumen and desire to see his students achieve bigger and better things helped turn CCPA into a consistent winner on and off the field.\n\n\"He's always been a guy with a lot of love. He doesn't know a stranger and he doesn't know an enemy,\" said St. Henry (Kentucky) head coach Tim Odom, who played against Cargile in high school and alongside him at Ohio State.\n\nIn 2019, Cargile's Taft Senators played in the Division V, Region 20 semifinals and had high hopes for the 2020 season.\n\nBut during that COVID-shortened season, Cincinnati Public Schools did not kick off until mid-September. It was the only school district in Southwest Ohio not to begin playing in late August. Cargile was among those who spoke publicly, saying they thought the decision hurt the students; he saw multiple players get into trouble with the law while they were unable to play football.\n\n\"Looking back on it now, I would have probably done it differently,\" Cargile said of the situation that may have led to him and Taft parting ways. \"But a lot of these kids, you have to merge (academics and athletics) together, because for a lot of them, that's what motivates them to be at school every day.\"\n\nHis main concern was that he didn't want to see his kids go down the same road he had in the 1990s and 2000s. Cargile is approaching 20 years free of drug and alcohol abuse and has spent time in jail for multiple offenses.\n\nIn 2015, the Ohio State Board of Education granted Cargile a certificate of qualification for employment (CQE) with the stipulation that he undergo a criminal background check one year later. He has had a spotless record since leaving prison in 2005.\n\n\"I've been to the penitentiary, I've been in and out of jail and treatment facilities. I've lost relationships with family members that I've had to regain. They don't have to do that because I already did. I've borne all that pain,\" Cargile said.\n\nAfter parting ways with Taft, a school he said he has no ill will toward, he was instantly given another opportunity by then-CCPA head coach Jeremy Pflug. Cargile was the defensive coordinator for one year before taking over as the head coach when Pflug left to coach at Woodward.\n\nMore: After losing parents, surviving fire, CCPA's Petey Jones finds crowning moment on football field\n\nWhile the Lions struggled in his first year and ended with a 5-6 record, they have won at least seven games in each of the last three years, including a trip to the regional semifinals in 2024.\n\nSuccess has followed Cargile everywhere he's gone. He had a 38-12 record in five years at Taft. After a college career where he was a three-year letter winner at Ohio State, he spent stints at Withrow, Madeira and his alma mater, Roger Bacon.\n\n\"He was the most talented competitor we played against in the GCL those years. He was an unbelievable running back and a tremendous human being,\" Odom said.\n\nCargile has a soft spot for small, urban schools because of his upbringing through Roger Bacon. He is most comfortable in those environments, and he said he believes that life has led him to those places because that's where he can have the greatest impact on his students.\n\n\"I try to run my program like a Power Five college program. I know I don't have all the resources a lot of these bigger schools have, but one of the things I used to hate hearing coaches and administrators say was, 'You can't do that stuff at Taft or at Withrow.' I've always come from the school of 'you can.'\" Cargile said. \"I'm very firm and very stern in my message to them, but I love my kids at the same time. I try to give them the best opportunities that I can.\"\n\nThe CMAC website listed 40 players on CCPA's 2025 roster. Only five were seniors.\n\nThe Lions, who went 8-3 this season and won a third straight CMAC-Blue title, return quarterback Kemmarion McCray, leading rusher Marlan Robertson, top receivers Kendrick Napier and Mario Meatchem, and defensive stars Sir Michael Miller, Charles Howard, Kenny Powe, Ryan Drew and Ramik Bell.\n\n\"I am so excited and I'm so anxious to get this offseason started. This team that I have coming back, there's no way that we should not be playing in the regional semi or the regional championship next year. I'm anxious for my kids to get to compete with the St. Henrys and the Marion Locals,\" Cargile said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Jeff Cargile brings compassion, winning attitude to CCPA football",

It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I turned 15, like all my friends, I wanted to get a job at a café to earn money. But my father pushed me to start my company young, and it's the reason I'm now financially independent at 20.\n\nI started selling origami butterfly artwork, a skill I picked up from a school trip to Japan and honed during the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nI started selling them at markets in Melbourne when I was 16. When I made my first sale to a lady who bought three of my artworks for $100, I was shocked. It was the first time I realized I could earn money with something I had made with my own hands.\n\nI added jewelry to the product mix not long after starting my company, Kiana Mei Designs, which sells affordable, customizable jewelry, as well as origami artworks.\n\nUntil the end of high school, I balanced school on weekdays and the markets on weekends. I passed my 12th grade with one of the highest grades in my school, which could qualify me for most college courses.\n\nBut I decided to go all in on my business for just one year, focusing on growing it instead of going to college. As I was running my business, I thought, \"What am I actually going to be studying in university that's related to business that I'm not already doing now?\"\n\nI now have a stall at Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne, open from Tuesday to Sunday. I've moved out of my parents' house, am financially independent, and don't regret anything.\n\nBut there are three things I wish I had known before diving headfirst into my business.\n\nThe first thing I wish I knew was the isolation I'd feel as a young business owner.\n\nI was still in school when I first started, so I had friends with whom I was quite close at the time, who shared similar academic interests.\n\nBut when I finished high school and moved out, and I started doing my own thing, those friends drifted away, and I wasn't as close with them anymore. We didn't have much in common.\n\nThere are not a lot of young business owners, especially in Melbourne and in Australia, and especially young female entrepreneurs. I've attended numerous networking events, but the people around me are a lot older than me, so it's harder to relate.\n\nI wish that I'd learned early on how to balance work and life, and how to switch off.\n\nLast Christmas, I think I was selling at my stall for 14 days straight without a break. The physical toll it takes is no joke — I think people don't really realize how taxing it can be on the body to stand all day.\n\nWhen I get sick and have a cold, I lose my voice completely. Last August, I lost my voice for five days, and that meant five days without work because I need to speak to customers.\n\nBut health always comes first, so I try to stay healthy.\n\nI make sure to get a workout in at 5 a.m., then eat a good breakfast before heading to the market. I go to bed around 10 p.m.\n\nIt's important to remember that your product isn't for everyone.\n\nI learned this in the very early days of my business. When customers would walk past my stall without talking to me, I used to feel a sense of rejection.\n\nI would think, \"Why didn't they stop?\" and I would overthink everything.\n\nWhen it comes to retail, you shouldn't overthink it, because not everyone will like your product, and not everyone will like you. You have to find the people who truly appreciate your products.\n\nOver time, I've come to accept that. When I'm at the market, of course, I'll try to speak to everyone, but if someone doesn't say hello back to me, or if someone doesn't want to stop and have a look, then it doesn't mean anything to me.\n\nIt's just on to the next person.",

    "fullText": "LSU Tigers star safety AJ Haulcy is ending his college football career as he declares for the NFL draft, per Hayes Fawcett of On3Sports.\n\nLike teammate Mansoor Delane, Haulcy transferred to the Tigers this past season with hopes of getting more eyes on him and building up his draft stock. Both players succeeded in big ways.\n\nHaulcy led LSU in tackles this past season with 88. He also added three interceptions, four passes broken up, and a forced fumble. He held his own in coverage and was a thumper in the run game. There's nothing else the Tigers could have asked him to do.\n\nThere was a four-week stretch where he finished with at least 12 tackles in each game. It felt like he was involved in every play that went into the box. His best individual game was in the losing effort against the Texas A&M Aggies, when he had 12 tackles with an interception and a pass break up.\n\nThe Texas native is a major college football success story. He came out of high school as a three-star recruit. 247Sports had him ranked as the 150th best safety in that class and the 266th best player in his home state.\n\nHe was viewed with more respect as a transfer, but he still ended up outplaying those expectations. He was the 151st player in the portal and the third-ranked safety. Now, he's going to be one of the first safeties taken in the NFL draft, receiving some second-round evaluations.\n\nHaulcy now becomes the third player from this Tigers team to declare for the draft, joining Delane and Aaron Anderson.",

The account makes itself out to be legitimate, but there's nothing to suggest real reporting, and no other college basketball reporters have this news.\n\nIt's certainly an odd thing to share on Christmas Day. Apparently nothing better to do with time than a fake post about a former Illinois center. There was actually a separate fake post about Cockburn earlier in the week, too.\n\nCockburn has played professionally overseas and seems likely to continue that.\n\nIllinois would take him back if he wanted to return, though, that's for sure.\n\nMORE: This new Caitlin Clark commercial is awesome",

    "fullText": "Matt Patricia is used to postseason runs from his days as the defensive coordinator of the New England Patriots.\n\nHowever, Patricia acknowledges that the preparation for the College Football Playoff is different than the NFL. Patricia is in his first season as Ohio State's defensive coordinator as the second-seeded Buckeyes (12-1) get ready to face 10th-seeded Miami (11-2) in a CFP quarterfinal at the Cotton Bowl on Dec. 31.\n\n“It’s a learning (process) for me. We’d have bye-week kind of moments in the NFL, but this is a really long layover and break,” Patricia said. “Right now, I’m trying to trust the expertise in the building. Some of the things we did transfer, you know, because we have some different kind of scheduling and when everybody is in school and that stuff.”\n\nOhio State was off for two weeks after its 13-10 loss to Indiana in the Big Ten championship game on Dec. 6. Players were mostly occupied with final exams while waiting to see who they would face in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nWith the Buckeyes going for consecutive national championships for the first time in school history, Patricia's first season in Columbus has exceeded expectations. He was hired after Jim Knowles left for Penn State, tasked with leading a unit that returned only three starters, none on the defensive line.\n\nPatricia and Ohio State made an emphatic opening statement in their Aug. 30 14-7 victory over Texas and continued the momentum throughout the season.\n\nThe Buckeyes are ranked either first or second nationally in nine different categories. They lead the nation in scoring defense (8.2 points per game), passing yards (129.1), red zone scores (66.7%) and fewest plays of 10 or more yards (90).\n\nOhio State had three AP All-America first-team selections on the defense — defensive tackle Kayden McDonald, linebacker Arvell Reese and safety Caleb Downs. All three plus linebacker Sonny Styles are projected to be first-round picks in April's NFL draft.\n\nPatricia, who returned to coaching in college for the first time since 2002, is a finalist for the Broyles Award, which is given to the top assistant coach in college football.\n\n“The players have done an unbelievable job. Again, give them all the credit. I think they’ve played so hard and aggressive and flying around on the field. And it is a lot of fun. I tell them all the time, it’s such a privilege to be up there in front of the group and talk to the group,” Patricia said. “And just for me, personally, it has been so much fun to come back to college and have that little bit of a youthful energy with the players that we have here and their excitement to go out and play.”\n\nWhen Patricia was hired, many lauded his ability to adjust his personnel by running multiple fronts and coverages. He also has shown the ability to relate to players.\n\n“When he first stepped on campus here, it was like a long-lost family member that just came back from whatever he came from, but he came back home,” defensive end Kenyatta Jackson said. “And I mean, all the guys love him. Even offensive guys. He don’t just talk to the starters or whatever the case may be, but he talks to everybody. And I think that’s why everybody loves him.”\n\nOne person who hasn't been surprised with Patricia's success is the guy who hired him.\n\n“His background speaks for itself and putting guys into a situation to be successful. And every player just wants someone that’s going to be there to get them better but also wants someone to care about them. He’s done both of those things,\" coach Ryan Day said. \"It’s great to have somebody in the building who has been through some of the games he’s been through, the Super Bowls and a lot of playoff games, so there’s a confidence level the guys have in him. So, I think all of that adds up to what you’re seeing.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "\"Are you coming to the 9 o'clock service with us?\" I asked my 22-year-old son. It was a Saturday night, a month or so after he had moved home after graduating from college.\n\n\"Actually, I'm going to check out the Catholic church,\" he replied.\n\nI paused. The fact that he wanted to attend the Catholic church was somewhat surprising, but not shocking. After all, his girlfriend of three years was Catholic. She lived a few hours away, having moved there to attend graduate school.\n\nI felt disappointed that he would rather attend the Catholic church alone than go to our Protestant church. I wondered if he had rejected his father, me, and our traditions.\n\nWhen my son moved back home after graduating last spring, we welcomed this bonus time with him as we readjusted to sharing a house again.\n\nGone was the gangly teen who left home at age 18, replaced by a young man focused on his new career. It struck me as surreal that we could chat about work like peers over the dinner table, then seconds later, I'd be nagging him to hang up his towel from the bathroom floor.\n\nIt felt like I had my son back, but something had changed.\n\nWhile our family had always attended church, finding support and meaning there, my son had not been enthusiastic about going, especially as a teenager. He never wanted to attend the youth group, saying he didn't click with the other kids. Later, when we dropped him off at college armed with a list of local churches and student fellowship groups to check out, he didn't speak of them.\n\nHe seemed to wander away from his faith for a while, or at least let it simmer in the background.\n\nThat changed when he moved home after college. He started coming to church with us again. It felt like another way my son came back to me. But after checking out the Catholic church in town, he started attending mass there regularly.\n\nI saw that my son was taking his faith journey more seriously, and it made me quietly pleased. Still, it continued to bother me that he was no longer attending the same church as my husband and me.\n\n\"Where's the big guy?\" our pastor inquired about our son a couple of months ago.\n\nWhen I shared the news that my son was attending the Catholic church in town, our pastor nodded thoughtfully. I followed this up with the happy news that my son had proposed to his girlfriend and they were now engaged. When I mentioned his fiancée was Catholic, our pastor broke into a smile.\n\nHe expressed genuine support for my son attending a different church, emphasizing how important it was for our son to pursue a deeper relationship with God at the same place his fiancée worshiped. It would only make him a better husband, he concluded.\n\nI felt a range of emotions: surprise, relief, and happiness. My pastor flipped my perspective, and rightly so. I realized my son wasn't rejecting us; rather, he was pursuing his independence and preparing for a life with his fiancée.\n\nHe wasn't walking away from us, but using the seeds his dad and I may have planted all those years we took him to church to grow his faith along a path that belonged to him.\n\nMy son and his fiancée are planning their wedding for later next year. They'll marry in a Catholic church, and I will be blessed to watch them commit to each other there. I'm grateful he found his faith again, and that what once felt like him drifting away was really him growing toward his own adult faith and future.",

I just wasn’t sure.”\n\nHe said he believes this was not the first time his daughter had visited the property where she died. Authorities are still looking into what led Leah to fall.\n\n“We just kind of always had something in the back of our mind that something could happen,\" he explained.\n\nStill, he said, \"I’m just hoping it [the fall] was instant. I just hope she felt no pain,\" Leah's dad said.\n\nTodd said that visiting properties like the one where his daughter died is “dangerous” and suggested Leah may have been with people she “really don’t know.”\n\nAs of midday on Tuesday, Dec. 23, more than $2,500 has been raised through a GoFundMe campaign started to support Leah’s family.\n\nTom Cavanaugh, a family friend who organized the online fundraiser, said donations will go toward covering Leah’s funeral and memorial costs.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nAccording to Cavanaugh, Leah had an affinity for photography and “loved exploring and photographing abandoned buildings.”\n\n“She was a beautiful and vibrant young lady originally from Florida who lived for the beach and outdoors,” Cavanaugh wrote. “She was always the popular kid in school and got along with everybody. Her family is left absolutely heartbroken.”\n\nLeah is survived by her father, her mother and two brothers, Cavanaugh said.\n\nAn informal memorial will take place at a Kennesaw park on Tuesday, according to WAGA.",

    "fullText": "College football has never been more transactional than it is right now.\n\nWith players allowed to make money through Name, Image and Likeness deals and a transfer portal that currently features 852 athletes, the sport is truly in a new day and age. Private equity is starting to get involved, adding to the corporate feel that is growing.\n\nThat’s what makes the culture that Arizona State football coach Kenny Dillingham has created in Tempe stand out. Yes, Dillingham might be the most easy-going coach in college football when it comes to the transfer portal. Not many other coaches will wish you good luck and promote your transfer on social media.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean ASU is just a bus stop and hoping to reload with transfer portal players every season. There’s a sense of real connection within the building.\n\nSophomore linebacker Martell Hughes was recruited from high school in San Diego as part of the second class signed under Dillingham. Hughes said he was drawn in specifically because of Dillingham.\n\n“The culture that coach Kenny had defined, that he wanted to bring, especially with all the new guys he brought in with the portal,” Hughes said. “The plan he had built for this and the city of Tempe. Just believing in him and the coaching staff is what ultimately brought me here.”\n\nThe word is used throughout the world of sports, yet there is no one singular definition. It’s different everywhere.\n\n“Being a family, being passionate, having the love and want to do this and day in and day out,” Hughes said. “He talks about it every day. Football is hard, and it’s a violent game, but if you don’t love it, there’s no point in doing it. His passion and love for his guys on the team, staff, it just runs through everybody. It’s infectious.”\n\nOr, as Dillingham has made the motto of the team: “Have more fun while working harder than anybody in the country.”\n\nThe phrase is blasted all over the team’s walls and has been repeated countless times by Dillingham and his players. Now, it has come to personify the nature of these Sun Devils.\n\nIt’s one of the reasons why Hughes has stayed in Tempe, instead of entering the portal and trying to get more playing time elsewhere.\n\n“Coming out of high school, they took the chance on me,” Hughes said. “They mapped out a plan for me and for this program. Believing in them. Why would I jump ship when they put their all into me?”\n\nThat belief is on track to pay off as Hughes, after learning and developing from Keyshaun Elliott and Jordan Crook the past two seasons, appears ready to move up the depth chart entering 2026. Hughes had the game-sealing interception in the win against TCU.\n\nEven for players who have spent time in other locker rooms, like graduate student and offensive lineman Ben Coleman, the culture at ASU is distinctive.\n\nColeman played 25 games at the University of California and earned his bachelor's and master's there before transferring to Tempe. He played the last two seasons for Arizona State after receiving an extra year of eligibility.\n\n“It’s different here,” Coleman said. “It’s very personal the way they challenge us, in the weight room, on the football field. The way they will us to compete in everything we do. Doesn’t matter if it’s Madden, (NBA) 2K, bringing a hoop out here, playing knockout. Everything is competing. That’s why we have a basketball hoop in the football team room, for that exact reason.”\n\nThe competition never ends. The team tracks what every player does and compiles it. It's referred to as “Skittles Wars.” From breakfast check-in to study hall and reps in the weight room, nothing goes unnoticed. At the end of the season, a winner is declared.\n\n“You wake up, and the first thing you do before you even open a notebook is, ‘Hey man. Let’s compete right now,’” Coleman said. “If you can’t compete, he doesn’t want anybody there who doesn’t want to compete.”\n\nLike Coleman, defensive lineman Justin Wodtly spent time in other locker rooms, playing at Cincinnati before transferring ahead of the 2024 season. Some of those locker rooms were strictly football, nothing else.\n\n“I’ve had three head coaches,” Wodtly said. “Here, it shows how much Coach Dillingham really cares about the team, how much he cares about building relationships, how much he cares about your life outside of football. Doing all those things is a testament to who he is as a person.”\n\nPerhaps the person who most embodies — literally — the culture that has been created at Arizona State is Wodtly.\n\nOnly 18 months passed before Wodtly decided to make ASU part of his body, getting a sprawling tattoo on his right calf with Sparky’s pitchfork as the centerpiece, set in front of a desert landscape with saguaros, mountains and lightning in the sky.\n\nAnd more could be on the way in the future.\n\n“It’s a huge part of me, who I am,” Wodtly said. “I appreciate this university. I’m very grateful for the time I got to spend here. I might have to add to it soon.”\n\nLogan Stanley is a sports reporter with The Arizona Republic who primarily focuses on high school, college and Olympic sports.

The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.\n\nRead our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree here\n\nWhen work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.\n\nRead our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 here\n\nWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.\n\nRead our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake here\n\nFew games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.\n\nRead our review of Expedition 33 here.\n\nI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time.\n\nRead our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds here\n\nIf you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.\n\nRead our review of Split Fiction here.\n\nThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that \"one more run\" itch.\n\nRead our review of Ball X Pit here\n\nIf you are \n\nRead our review of Blue Prince here\n\nWould you trust your best friends to help you climb a mountain? What about your family? Well, wonder no longer, as, thanks to indie developer Team Peak, you will now be able to do just that (in a safe, non-real-world scenario) with Peak. This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive. With cute visuals, proximity chat, climbing items to help you, and more, all helped push Peak to the top of Steam charts this year, and it is a great time to check out while on break this holiday.\n\nCheck out a bit of the history behind Peak here\n\nWhether it's Ultimate, Brawl, Melee, or any of the other variations, I have never attended a gathering that Super Smash Bros. hasn't improved. The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old. While the world anxiously waits for the word of a Switch 2 Smash, the old versions are just as fun to revisit, so grab some controllers and prepare to fight!\n\nRead our review of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate here",

    "description": "While Bill Gates has said the two-day workweek could come within the next decade, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says Gen Alpha college graduates will be too busy planet-hopping.",
    "fullText": "With Gen Z facing existential career crises, billionaire OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that in just 10 years, college grads will be exploring the solar system—jobs that will reel in sky-high salaries. The tech leader even says he’s envious of young people because our early-career jobs will look “boring” by comparison.\n\nAs AI reshapes the workforce, many Gen Z college graduates are finding out the hard way that their degrees don’t guarantee a smooth career launch.\n\nNow, even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman—one of Silicon Valley’s biggest leaders driving the AI revolution—is admitting the elephant in the room is true: AI will wipe out some jobs entirely. However, the tech billionaire insists the coming decade could be the most exciting time in history to start a career, especially for anyone who’s ever dreamed of working in space.\n\nNot only will they be reeling in sky-high salaries, but Altman says they’ll also be “feeling so bad for you and I that we had to do this really boring, old work and everything is just better.”\n\n“In 2035, that graduating college student, if they still go to college at all, could very well be leaving on a mission to explore the solar system on a spaceship in some completely new, exciting, super well-paid, super interesting job,” Altman told video journalist Cleo Abram.\n\nThough it’s unclear how widespread space exploration will expand in the coming years—considering NASA’s broad goal of getting to Mars in the 2030s—aerospace engineers are growing faster than the national average of all jobs, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And they bring home an envy-inducing annual paycheck of over $130,000.\n\nOther tech pioneers have AI predictions that are more grounded on Earth—but still alluring to workers. For example, billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said that the technology might dramatically reduce the length of the workweek, thanks to humans no longer being needed “for most things.”\n\n“What will jobs be like? Should we just work like two or three days a week?” the tech billionaire told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed that AI has already given his workers “superhuman” skills—something that will only increase as the technology advances.\n\n“I’m surrounded by superhuman people and super intelligence, from my perspective, because they’re the best in the world at what they do. And they do what they do way better than I can do it. And I’m surrounded by thousands of them. Yet it never one day caused me to think, all of a sudden, I’m no longer necessary,” he separately told Cleo Abram on her Huge Conversations podcast series.\n\nWhile Altman admitted that his crystal ball remains foggy—and that the true direction of AI is unclear—he is actually envious of Gen Z professionals starting off their careers: “If I were 22 right now and graduating college, I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history,” he added to Abram.\n\nFortune reached out to OpenAI for comment.\n\nAfter the launch of OpenAI model, GPT-5, Altman declared the world has access to technology equivalent to a “team of PhD-level experts” right in their pocket. And as a result, the CEO said it will be easier than ever for one person to create a business that used to take “hundreds” of people—all it takes is coming up with a great idea and mastering AI tools.\n\n“It is probably possible now to start a company, that is a one-person company that will go on to be worth more than a billion dollars, and more importantly than that, deliver an amazing product and service to the world, and that is like a crazy thing,” he said.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban has gone even further with his prediction, saying that AI could give Elon Musk a run for his money as the world’s richest person.\n\n“We haven’t seen the best or the craziest of what [AI is] going to be able to do,” Cuban told the High Performance podcast. “And not only do I think it’ll create a trillionaire, but it could be just one dude in the basement. That’s how crazy it could be.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on August 11, 2025.\n\n‘Godmother of AI’ says degrees are less important in hiring than how quickly you can ‘superpower yourself’ with new tools\n\nForget the four-day workweek, Elon Musk predicts you won’t have to work at all in ‘less than 20 years’\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos says ‘millions of people’ will be living in space by 2045—and robots will commute on our behalf to the moon\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

The Buckeyes are 8-3, but have not shot the ball particularly well lately, hitting just 26% of their three-pointers over the past five games.\n\nGrambling comes into Tuesday’s game as winners of each of their last two games, bringing their season record to 5-6. They are one of the very worst teams in the nation at taking care of the basketball, turning the ball over on 21.8% of their possessions. While they can be disruptive on the defensive end, they also struggle to take care of it themselves. This is the second meeting every between the two programs, with Ohio State having won the first game in 2015.\n\nThe Buckeyes have fallen to 16th in the Big Ten in three-point shooting at 33.7%. The last time Ohio State shot 33.7% or lower as a team from three-point range was the 2015-16 season, when OSU shot 33.4%.\n\nConnect with Connor: \nTwitter: @lemons_connor",

    "description": "The John R.",
    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it's 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nWhen Rick Barnes was handed the 2018 Coach Wooden \"Keys to Life\" Award, it was noted how his life displayed the character traits of integrity and leadership in the game of basketball, reflecting the values of legendary coach John Wooden.\n\nIt's long been the University of Tennessee coach's mantra, consistently blending culture, development, and adaptability for the young men he's mentored since beginning his coaching career in 1977.\n\nBarnes, who ranks among the all-time Top 20 winningest men's college basketball coaches, hasn't just been a coach who wins games; he's built sustainable programs.\n\nBarnes turned Clemson into a national contender in the 1990s, he elevated Texas into a national power with regular NBA talent, and more recently, he's rebuilt Tennessee into one of the SEC’s most consistent teams.\n\nBarnes went to the Final Four with Texas in 2003, won the Big East Tournament with Providence in 1994 and the SEC Tournament in 2022 with Tennessee.\n\nHe's also won a combined five regular-season conference championships with Texas and Tennessee.\n\nThere have been very few coaches who have succeeded at three different top-tier major schools.\n\nThough he's known for being a demanding coach, he's never fallen short of the respect he's received from players.\n\nBarnes has always been clear about his standards for effort and behavior. His players have learned there are no shortcuts toward minutes earned, and he's always allowed for strong locker-room leadership\n\nMany of his former players often talk about how much Barnes helped them mature as men, not just as athletes, a culture that leads to consistency year after year.\n\nAs for his coaching style, Barnes' teams are almost always physically tough behind a disciplined defense. They've typically been stellar with their half-court defense.\n\nHis teams have long been known for elite defensive efficiency, ball pressure, and rebounding. Defense has consistently given him a reliable floor every season, even when the offense fluctuates.\n\nEmphatic about established player development, Barnes always excels at developing players who elect to stay multiple years under his tutelage. Guards have been known to improve their decision-making and tenacity, his bigs get fundamentally stronger defensively and role players have notoriously grown into stars.\n\nMany of his best teams weren’t loaded with one-and-done talent, but with grown, experienced players who understood their roles.\n\nHis roster-building skills generally start with his knack for recruiting players who fit the system before they even arrive in the locker room.\n\nRather than chasing only top-5 recruits, Barnes prioritizes toughness, coachability and a defensive-mindset.\n\nCurrently, at Tennessee, Barnes has found players who fit the SEC grind and who buy into a team-basketball philosophy.\n\nUltimately, that translates into a mirror image of Barnes, who promotes consistency over flash.\n\nDespite being criticized for not having a national title, Barnes' real strength has producing his fair share of winning seasons, regular NCAA tournament appearances, getting his players to commit to higher standards and promoting the type of reliability that is extremely valuable in college basketball.\n\nThis former Wooden \"Keys to Life\" Award winner will go down as someone known as a teacher, culture-builder and defensive tactician who adapted over six decades without worrying about flash, but more so toughness and competitive consistency year after year.",

    "fullText": "Jacob Rodriguez was sleeping on the floor of his brother’s apartment and learning how to really play defense when he joined Texas Tech for spring practice in 2022, right after a season as a quarterback at Virginia.\n\nSuddenly a walk-on on the other side of the ball, Rodriguez even wondered if he might get cut by the Red Raiders.\n\n\"They’re trying to weed everybody out because it’s coach (Joey) McGuire’s first offseason,\" he said. “So, I'm just out there trying to make the team and then focus on football. It was real weird, totally different position.”\n\nQB-turned-linebacker Rodriguez is now an AP All-American for fourth-ranked Tech, which is in the College Football Playoff for the first time. The team captain with a distinctive mustache, whose wife flies Black Hawk helicopters in the U.S. Army, has a collection of trophies for national defensive player of the year awards, and was fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting. He is the first FBS player in 20 years with at least five forced fumbles (he has seven), two fumble recoveries and four interceptions in the same season.\n\n“He’s just a man of consistency, a man of routine and he’s just a great leader overall,” said Tech senior edge rusher David Bailey, a first-year transfer and also an AP All-America first-teamer.\n\nThe Red Raiders (12-1), in McGuire's fourth season, play No. 5 Oregon (12-1) in the CFP quarterfinal Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. The first-time Big 12 Conference champions already have a school-record 12 wins.\n\nRodriguez won the Chuck Bednarik and Bronko Nagurski awards as the top defensive player, and the Dick Butkus Award as the top linebacker. He got the Lombardi Award that's for exceptional performance while embodying character and discipline like the award's namesake.\n\nRodriguez played a little bit of safety in high school, but when he got to Tech he hadn’t been a linebacker since middle school, when the approach was much different.\n\n“I had no clue what I was doing. I was just going see ball, hit ball,” he said. “You’re playing linebacker, but you don’t have to study film, and you don’t have to understand the position as much.”\n\nAs a prep starting quarterback, Rodriguez accounted for 10,136 total yards (7,085 passing, 3,051 rushing) and 106 touchdowns (68 passing, 38 rushing) as Wichita Falls Rider made the Texas Class 5A playoffs three years in a row. He was then an early enrollee at Virginia, which gave him a scholarship offer as a quarterback. He never threw a pass in his 12 games with the Cavaliers, but had 56 yards rushing and 65 receiving while used as a running back, receiver and tight end. He left there after a coaching change.\n\n“It’s just really cool to see the way that his story has developed, and the kind of guy that he is,” said fifth-year Tech quarterback Behren Morton, a fellow Texan who was in some of the same camps as Rodriguez before college. “He’s probably put on close to 50 pounds, and just totally transformed his body to looking like a mean linebacker.”\n\nRodriguez played special teams and some defensive packages during his Tech debut in 2022, when he had 29 tackles and began to embrace being on that side.\n\n“Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play. I’ve done it on the offensive side of the ball, I’ve done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I’ve done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. “That’s kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.”\n\nHe was limited to five games in 2023 after injuring his foot in the opener on a play that he forced and recovered a fumble. His 127 tackles last year were the most for a Tech player since Lawrence Flugence set an NCAA FBS record with 193 in 2002. He has 117 this season after Tech reportedly invested more than $7 million on transfers along the defensive front, including Bailey, second-team AP All-America interior lineman A.J. Holmes Jr., and third-teamer Lee Hunter.\n\nAs tough as Rodriguez is, the 6-foot-1, 235-pound linebacker said there is no doubt that his wife Emma is even tougher.\n\nThe high school sweethearts got married in July 2023. Emma graduated from the United States Military Academy and is now based at Fort Riley in Kansas.\n\n\"She's the best, and she does so much for me,\" Jacob Rodriguez said. \"It's weird, I feel like to everybody else, that we do long distance and have done it. But I mean to us, it’s normal. It’s something that we’ve always done.”\n\nWhile disappointed he didn't get an invitation to New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony, Rodriguez was grateful and honored by the final results. His 17 first-place votes were nine more than Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin, the fourth-place finisher. Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman ahead of Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love.\n\n“I’m just so appreciative to even be in that conversation,\" Rodriguez said. \"That kind of hit home, was people really cared about me and see what the work that’s been done this year.”\n\nRodriguez has scored three touchdowns this season. He returned a fumble for a score against Oklahoma, and had short rushing TDs on his only carries when taking a direct snap in each of the last two regular-season games.\n\n“It was exciting and it was fun,” he said. “Those are the moments that I’ll never forget, where it’s just having fun playing football.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "South Carolina quarterback Air Noland plans to enter the transfer portal, On3’s Pete Nakos reports.\n\nNoland has spent one season apiece at two programs, as he redshirted at Ohio State, as part of a team for the Buckeyes that won the national title in the College Football Playoff, before coming to South Carolina. He then made his first career appearances this past fall as a backup for the Gamecocks.\n\nAfter not playing while in Columbus, Noland appeared off the sideline in two non-conference wins, one early in the year and one late, this season in Columbia. He came off the sideline in wins over South Carolina State in September and Coastal Carolina in November, as he is 2-3 (66.7%) for 13 yards while also having a rush for four yards.\n\nA native of College Park, Georgia, Noland played his high school football at Langston Hughes in Fairburn. He ranked as a Top-60 overall recruit there and as a four-star prospect in the 2024 recruiting cycle. He also rated as the No. 5 QB in the class and as a Top-10 player out of the state of Georgia. That’s according to Rivals’ Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He’d then arrive as one of the top signees for the Buckeyes in what was the No. 4 class in the country per Rivals’ Industry Team Recruiting Rankings.\n\nHowever, Noland has yet to be able to win a starting job to this point early in his career. He wasn’t expected to start last year at Ohio State, behind names like Will Howard, Devin Brown, Julian Sayin, and Lincoln Kienholz, as well as the eventual arrival the next offseason of Tavien St. Clair. However, after a year of backing up LaNorris Sellers, Noland likely expected to take the job for the Gamecocks as early as next fall, but Sellers is now anticipated to stay for another season at South Carolina rather than entering his name into the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nNoland has yet to get a real opportunity through two seasons at two programs in his collegiate career. He’ll now be looking for that in his third team in as many years, being a redshirt sophomore there with three years of eligibility remaining wherever he ends up next, once his name is officially in come the opening of the portal’s two-week window on January 2nd.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.\n\nThe On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "title": "Meet a 55-year-old automotive technician in Arkansas who didn’t care if his kids went to college: ‘There are options’",
    "description": "Clint Crawford has a message for parents who are concerned about the shortage of white-collar entry-level work: open their minds to the possibility of a fulfilling career otherwise.",
    "fullText": "When something breaks—whether it’s the plumbing or a car—the first call most people make is to a blue-collar worker. That was the lesson he wanted his children to understand.\n\nClint Crawford is a 55-year-old automotive technician at Midas Auto and Repair Shop in Arkansas. He has a message for parents who are concerned about the shortage of white-collar entry-level work: open their minds to the possibility of a fulfilling career elsewhere.\n\nLike the conversation Ford CEO Jim Farley described having at his own dinner table with his son, Crawford believes it should be a debate—one that needs to happen at dinner tables across the country.\n\n“They need to be introduced to alternatives, and we need to place an equal importance on technical programs,” he asserts.\n\nCrawford has a 22-year-old daughter and a 21-year-old son. Both went to college, but it wasn’t expected of them as the default while growing up, as he worked to emphasize the dignity and stability that comes with blue-collar careers.\n\n“If something happens with the plumbing, the first call is either the landlord or the plumber,” Crawford tells Fortune, adding that when a car breaks down, the first call goes to a repair shop.\n\n“The first call that most people are going to make is to that blue-collar worker.”\n\nThose were the examples he gave his children when counseling them on what career to pursue, believing that such workers are essential to the running of the economy and to the smooth functioning of everyday life.\n\n“That way, they could understand that there are options,” Crawford says.\n\nHe also urged his children to be realistic, something many parents can now relate to. While the majority of parents still prefer a four-year college education for their children, a new survey from American Student Assistance found that 35% believe some form of technical education or a blue-collar career may be better suited for their child. In 2019, that figure was 13%.\n\nAnd it makes sense. Most white-collar entry-level jobs require a college degree, which has become a severe economic burden for younger generations. According to a 2024 report by the Education Data Initiative, the average Gen Zer has $22,948 of student loan debt. In addition, companies have reduced their rates of hiring entry-level employees, in part due to tariff disruptions as well as AI automating some of these early work experiences.\n\nCrawford himself was concerned when his son decided to study data science, having heard—like many others—about struggles in hiring. But he realized that “it’s something that he enjoys, and he’s good at. And so computer science it is.”\n\nIdeally, Crawford believes schools and parents should start these types of conversations early on. For his kids, they decided college was, in fact, right for them. But they had a conversation, which he encourages others to have.\n\nFor Crawford’s family, career discussions took place before his kids earned college degrees, and he encouraged his kids to be practical.\n\n“I think a lot of times parents are telling their kids, you know, do what makes you happy.” That’s great, he says, but adds that “the reason we work is to pay bills.” If a worker can’t do that or is underpaid, “it just seems pointless.”\n\nCrawford believes people should consider these jobs as valid options that offer stability—something that seems hard-won these days. Young people should be offered aptitude tests to help determine what kind of work best aligns with their skills. When someone is good at math, he believes they should be encouraged to pursue blue-collar careers that require highly logical and math-heavy processes.\n\nCrawford has found that electricians are “incredibly math-oriented” and that liking math doesn’t mean you have to be a mathematician.\n\n“There are plenty of opportunities out there that require a strong background in math that don’t limit you to teaching math at the high school or college level,” he adds.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Oregon Ducks successfully advanced to the quarterfinals of the College Football Playoff against James Madison. Despite the Ducks keeping their season afloat, coach Dan Lanning said his team has a lot of work to do upon speaking to reporters Saturday following the win.\n\n“We didn’t play our best football,” Lanning said. “We turned the ball over multiple times and we’ve got to play better on defense. It was like a tale of two halves. We played well in the first half but didn’t play well in the second. We can play so much better than that.”\n\nLanning said the Rose Bowl loss to Ohio State this past season still bothers him, but suggests this year's team can find the resilience to pull through to keep rolling.\n\n“Getting better, period,” Lanning said. “Getting better. We got an opportunity to advance, and now we get an opportunity to improve.”\n\nMore specifically, Lanning was not happy with the Ducks' 34-6 halftime lead being squandered away.\n\n“We started off hot,” Lanning said. “We can be better. In the second half, as a team, we didn’t play the way we needed to play. You have to find moments like that when you have a big lead, to be able to choke somebody out and we didn’t do that.”\n\nThe Ducks will play the Texas Tech Red Raidersin the Capital One Orange Bowl on New Year's Day, with kickoff set for noon ET.\n\nGiven the meteoric run the Red Raiders have been on, especially led by linebacker Jacob Rodriguez, Ducks quarterback Dante Moore will have little room for error once the game finally gets underway.\n\nWe'll see if the Ducks can clean up their mistakes.",

Retzlaff took over as BYU’s starter for the final four games of the season following an injury to Kedon Slovis, famously becoming the first Jewish starting quarterback in school history.\n\nThough Retzlaff went 0-4 to finish 2023, he won the starting QB job over transfer Gerry Bohanon in 2024 and piloted the Cougars to a 11-2 mark to tie for first place in the Big 12 Conference and capture an Alamo Bowl victory over Colorado.\n\nRetzlaff was expected to start for BYU again in 2025, but a civil lawsuit filed this past May accusing him of sexual assault and battery resulted in his withdrawal from the school and eventual enrollment at Tulane. The case was ultimately dismissed in June.\n\nDespite joining the Green Wave just weeks before the start of fall camp, Retzlaff won the team’s starting quarterback job and powered Tulane to a 10-2 regular season and American Conference championship game win over North Texas, clinching the program’s first-ever CFP appearance.\n\nEarlier this week, ESPN wrote Retzlaff could be selected as high as the sixth round of April’s NFL draft.",

    "fullText": "Who will Ole Miss play next? Explaining the 2025 CFP bracket opponent for Round 2 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe No. 6 Ole Miss Rebels have emphatically answered the question of whether they can win without Lane Kiffin. In their first game since Kiffin left for LSU, and the biggest game in program history, the Rebels delivered a dominant performance at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, crushing the No. 11 Tulane Green Wave 41-10, to advance in the College Football Playoff. New head coach Pete Golding is now 1-0 in his debut, proving the 12-1 Rebels are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe victory showcased the Rebels' strength and determination despite the unusual mid-playoff coaching change. While Tulane allowed Jon Sumrall, the next head coach at Florida, to coach his final contest for the Green Wave, Ole Miss proved that its players were singularly focused on the championship path.\n\nWhat is certain, however, is that Ole Miss's reward for the decisive win is an immediate clash with one of the best coaches and teams in college football. That team is the No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs, led by two-time national champion head coach Kirby Smart. Georgia once again steamrolled the competition, finishing the season 12-1 and defeating Alabama to claim its fourth SEC championship under Smart. Entering the playoff, Smart owns a career record of 117-20, cementing Georgia as the preeminent power in the sport.\n\nThe Rebels will now travel to New Orleans to face Georgia in the Sugar Bowl quarterfinal on New Year’s Day. The game is a highly anticipated rematch of their regular-season contest on October 18, which Georgia won 43-35 after rattling off 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to hand Ole Miss its only loss of the season. The Bulldogs will be looking to rewrite the script from last season, when they were eliminated in the Sugar Bowl by Notre Dame.\n\nHere’s more on the highly anticipated SEC rematch between Ole Miss and Georgia.\n\nSN AWARDS: 2025 All-America team | Player of the Year | Coach of the Year\n\nMORE: College Football Playoff first round predictions\n\nOle Miss will face No. 3 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Day in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nGeorgia has emerged as one of, if not the, best programs in college football over the past five seasons. The Bulldogs won back-to-back championships in 2021 and 2022, securing the program's first national titles since 1980. This sustained period of dominance has seen them compile an FBS-best record of 64-6 since the start of the 2021 season, making them a perennial force in the playoff conversation.\n\nIn addition to the national titles, the Bulldogs have collected three of the last four SEC Championships, winning in 2022, 2024, and 2025, most recently a dominating 28-7 victory over No. 9 Alabama. The Crimson Tide were the one team that beat the Bulldogs this season, defeating them in September. But, Georgia was dominant in all three phases en route to another conference title in Atlanta.\n\nThis year's Georgia team is as talented as any in the country. On offense, Gunner Stockton is surrounded by talented skill position players, whether Zachariah Branch, Dillon Bell, Nate Frazier, Chauncey Bowens, Oscar Delp and more. On defense, the Bulldogs did not look like a typical Kirby Smart defense — especially when rushing the passer — early in the season, but have now gone four games allowing 10 or less points. There is an argument that though Georgia is No. 3, the best team in America lies in Athens.\n\nMORE: Georgia 2025 College Football Playoff tickets guide\n\nGeorgia and Ole Miss already squared off this year, with the Bulldogs winning 43-35 in Athens. Georgia, who is known for its dominance in the final frame, rattled off 17 fourth quarter points to give the Rebels their first and only loss.\n\nAn unparalleled run of success — two national championships, three SEC titles in four years, and nearly three calendar years without a regular-season loss — firmly establishes Georgia as the premier program in the modern era, setting the standard for every other team entering the newly expanded College Football Playoff.\n\nWith a head coach only in his second game in charge, the Rebels will face off against a program that everyone strives to be on New Years day. The No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs, the closest thing college football has to a dynasty, are awaiting their Lane Kiffin-less opponent in the Sugar Bowl Quarterfinal.\n\nRanking every Heisman winner from 200 to now\n\nFull list of college football's 2025 award winners\n\nTracking QB moves in the college football transfer portal",

    "description": "Trinidad Chabliss and Mississippi have aced their first test without former coach Lane Kiffin. The sixth-ranked Rebels beat No. 17 Tulane 41-10 on Saturday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.",
    "fullText": "OXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Trinidad Chambliss ran for two touchdowns and passed for another, and No. 6 Mississippi looked unfazed by the defection of coach Lane Kiffin, beating No. 17 Tulane 41-10 on Saturday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.\n\nScoring runs of 20 yards by Kewan Lacy and 4 yards by Chambliss gave Ole Miss (12-1) a 14-0 lead before eight minutes had elapsed in the coaching debut of Pete Golding, who was promoted from defensive coordinator after Kiffin left for LSU on Nov. 30.\n\nNext up for Golding and Ole Miss: a CFP quarterfinal against No. 2 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1\n\nTulane (11-3) and quarterback Jake Retzlaff moved the ball effectively at times, but the Rebels — who beat the Green Wave 45-10 on Sept. 20 — remained comfortably ahead throughout. Cornerback Jaylon Braxton had an early interception, and the Rebels’ defense had multiple fumble recoveries and fourth-down stops.\n\nWhile Kiffin had asked to keep coaching Ole Miss through the playoff even while working for its Southeastern Conference rival, athletic director Keith Carter would not allow it. So the Rebels entered arguably the most significant game ever played at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium with a new coach — not to mention an unprecedented level of looming staff and roster uncertainty for a team contending for a national title.\n\nIn Mississippi’s famed Grove, artwork around tailgate tents depicted Kiffin in a negative light, including one showing him on a Christmas “naughty” list, with Golding in the “nice” column.\n\nWhen Golding walked onto the field during warm-ups, the crowd roared. Fans continued cheering as Eli Manning, a former Ole Miss QB and two-time Super Bowl winner with the New York Giants, greeted the new Rebels coach on the sideline.\n\nOn the opposite sideline was Tulane coach Jon Sumrall, who was permitted to keep coaching the Green Wave after being hired by Florida. His hopes of returning to Tulane’s home city of New Orleans to prepare for the Sugar Bowl were dashed, and he’ll be packing up for Gainesville, Florida, to join the Gators.\n\nChambliss, who briefly left the game late in the first half after a big hit during an 11-yard scramble, finished with 282 yards passing. Lacy rushed for 87 yards before heading to the locker room in the fourth quarter with an apparent left shoulder injury. De’Zhaun Stribling caught five passes for 79 yards, including a 13-yard TD.\n\nLSU transfer Logan Diggs added a 3-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.\n\nRetzlaff finished with 306 yards passing and a TD for Tulane, whose loss dropped non-power conference teams to 0-3 in CFP games (with James Madison playing at Oregon later Saturday night). Jamauri McClure gained 84 yards on 15 carries.\n\nTulane: The Green Wave could not afford a poor start on defense and got exactly that as the Rebels scored two TDs on their first seven offensive plays. As in the teams’ first meeting, Tulane moved the ball in spurts, finishing with 421 yards, but could sustain drives long enough to score.\n\nOle Miss: Kiffin’s absence didn’t inhibit the Rebels’ explosiveness on offense — at least not against a team from a non-power conference. The Rebels finished 497 yards of total offense, including four plays that went for 25 yards or more.",

    "description": "I felt ashamed for being overweight in high school, so I stayed consistent with a healthy diet in college. That practice made me a better student.",
    "fullText": "The menus hadn't even closed before I blurted out my order: a salad. It was my way of throwing my friends off the scent, as if a plate of lettuce could erase the truth and hide my late-night snack binging. But deep down, I knew the only person I was fooling was myself.\n\nAt 16, about 4 years ago, standing at 5'9\" and 120 pounds overweight, I felt powerless — not just over my body, but over the insecurities that dictated how I moved through the world.\n\nWeighing over 300 pounds was the elephant in every room I walked into, and most days I felt like the elephant myself. I vividly remember sitting in doctors' offices and being told my BMI was too high, but every time their words felt clinical and detached. What I felt each day was far more immediate, as every choice I made revolved around trying to shrink: grabbing something small at restaurants, ducking out of photos, hesitating to speak up in class for fear of drawing attention.\n\nI was exhausted, yet trying to change felt even more overwhelming. I hoped everything would be different in college.\n\nWhen I arrived at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, the thought of starting fresh collided with the reality that I was still carrying the same weight, physically and emotionally.\n\nWatching everyone else carve out their independence made me realize that if I wanted to take advantage of this new beginning, I couldn't keep living in the shadow of my body insecurities. That recognition, that no one could make this change for me, was the first real decision I ever made on my own.\n\nThe process was messy. I researched and experimented, failed and adjusted, over and over again. I cut out seconds, swapped soda for water, and reminded myself that a slice of cake today would not help me tomorrow.\n\nAt first, it felt impossible. I failed often, sometimes in secret, but each time that I pulled myself back on track, I chipped away at the belief that I was incapable of discipline.\n\nAt first, the changes felt so small they seemed pointless, but gradually I noticed patterns forming. My cravings dulled, my routines steadied, and I began to trust myself in situations that once felt impossible.\n\nI came to understand that progress was not a straight line; it curved, dipped, and sometimes reversed. The true test was whether I could keep going even when no one else was forcing me to.\n\nSuccess didn't come as dramatic numbers on a scale but in quieter victories: having the energy to walk across campus without losing my breath, joining a conversation instead of hanging back, and looking in the mirror without immediately turning away.\n\nThe discipline and resilience I built through that journey have carried into every corner of my college life. Balancing coursework, adjusting to independence, and navigating friendships all required the same patience and persistence I first practiced at the table.\n\nI approached long nights of studying the way I approached exercise: one choice at a time, knowing consistency mattered more than perfection. I learned to prioritize my well-being, to recognize when to push forward and when to rest, and to trust that even when progress didn't look linear, it was still happening.\n\nWith the past in the rearview mirror, the desire for change and knowledge feeds my hunger that was once covered up by sweets and treats. My curiosity for more only grew.\n\nThe skills I have obtained before and during my transformation have taught me to believe that change is good. It pushes you to grow into the person you are meant to be. The hardships, growth, and setbacks have helped build my mindset to continue pushing myself.",

    "description": "Linda Martindale, a boys high school coach, mental fitness expert and mom to collegiate players, says college athletes have this special ingredient.",
    "fullText": "Linda Martindale wasn’t brave, at least she didn’t think she was after she had been hired as a varsity boys basketball coach.\n\n“Once the game started, I was fine,” says Martindale, now in her sixth season leading Lincoln-Sudbury (MA), “but walking into the gym and people thinking I'm the scorekeeper or whatever, I had to sort of overcome this feeling of, ‘Do I belong in the gym?’ ”\n\nShe made the three words her mantra, and she convinced herself she was brave. You need to be as an athlete, or a coach, in today’s world of youth sports.\n\n“I have fond memories of my athletic career, but I also know there was a lot of heartache and it was very difficult,” says Martindale, who played Division II basketball at Alaska-Anchorage and in the old Pac-10 at Arizona in the late 1980s and early 1990s. “But nowadays, it's totally different. Your whole career is splashed all over social media.”\n\nMartindale’s father devoted his life to coaching baseball and football, driving her and her three siblings to be punctual and polite. He was hard on them, she says, but led with love.\n\n“If I had a bad game, the people in the stands knew and my parents knew, and that was it,” Martindale tells USA TODAY Sports. “You'd come home and your parents would say, ‘How did the game go?' You could self-report that. Easy to deal with.\n\n“My oldest son would literally get DMs from strangers that say horrible things if he missed a free throw in the clutch. The landscape is very different. And it obviously trickles down to youth.”\n\nMartindale got certified as a mental fitness coach to help ease the pressure on her three sons and one daughter (all of them have played college sports) but also other young athletes.\n\nShe works with sports teams at Division I Holy Cross and D-III Curry College, as well as individual athletes. She says there’s a secret beyond the physical component to playing sports in college.\n\nWe offer 10 ways, through consultation with Martindale, for parents to help athletes get there.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nWhen Martindale walked into the gym feeling the male eyes on her, she felt she needed an inner coach.\n\nYour coach on the court or field will tell you what to do but, Martindale says, the one in your head will kick you in the butt to help get you where you need to go.\n\nJenny Levy, who has won four national titles as North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, believes so strongly in an inner coach she likes when her players form their own mantras.\n\n“Confidence looks good on you,” she heard her players say to each other in 2013, the year they broke through.\n\n“A lot of coaches will say, ‘This is our saying,’ ” Levy told Martindale on Martindale’s ‘Game Changers’ podcast. “And I think that’s fine – to each his own – but I actually let our team organically come up with their own little things. This is the team having a good time together.”\n\nThe inner voice tells you it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, only what you do.\n\nTo come up with your own mantra, Martindale says, ask yourself why you play a sport? Look for performance cues to grind that thought into you.\n\n“It's not fun to lose, but it's still really fun to compete and to play,” Martindale says. “OK, good, let's start with that. So at least you can say it's not fun to lose, but it's really fun to prepare for the game. We've now established that the majority of the time is fun. Now we can get through the parts that aren't fun.”\n\nWas that ‘fun’? How Coco Gauff’s tough US Open embodies what the word means\n\nKids respond to the truth. We don’t need to always sugarcoat it.\n\nInstead of saying, “It’s not so hard,” acknowledge that something is.\n\nMaybe you’re afraid that you might lose or you’re going to make a fool of yourself in front of everybody.\n\n“I'm happy that you can articulate a fear,” Martindale might tell an athlete. “Now, let's squash it. What are you really afraid of? Is it really embarrassing to lose, or is it embarrassing not to play at all?\n\n“It would be embarrassing if you threw yourself on the floor and screamed and cried in the middle of the game. But nobody thinks it's embarrassing that you sat on the bench, cheered on your team, and then fought another day to try to get some minutes.”\n\nA current role doesn’t mean an ultimate role. Martindale goes back to Tom Brady.\n\nHe was once buried deep on Michigan’s depth chart. But he focused on nailing reps he got in practice. He was at game speed when he found himself starting.\n\n“As parents, we say, ‘I don't think you should have to be the backup quarterback,' \" Martindale says. “ 'I think you should be the quarterback.’ This is not helping. What you need to do is crush being the backup. And then your time comes and you're ready instead of spending so much time worrying that you don't have the role that you want (and) you're not ready for it.”\n\nAnother of her podcast guests, Luke Avdalovic, a former walk-on basketball player at Northern Arizona University, told her: “I had a teammate named JoJo Anderson and he told me, ‘If you want to find a role into this team, find one thing that you’re really good at. Make sure you’re head and shoulders better than every single other person on the team. Then they can’t take you off the floor.’ ”\n\nAvdalovic became a top sharpshooter who rose to the NBA G-League.\n\nAvdalovic has shot so much over the years he feels he’s never really in a slump. Some days he shoots better than others, but that is just the law of averages.\n\n“You can't be a pitcher if you can't pitch poorly,” Martindale says. “You can't be a shooter if you can't miss. It's just not possible (to) be perfect. So what do you do when you're imperfect?”\n\nThe next time your son or daughter has a bad game, ask them, “Did you compete hard?”\n\nYou don’t want them to lose or fail but they need to know how to do both. As parents, and as coaches, our best support can come out of struggles.\n\nYou know the term if you’re a baseball fan. Suddenly, Steve Sax or Chuck Knoblauch can’t make a routine throw from second to first base, or Rick Ankiel can’t throw a strike.\n\n“Yips is not a real thing,” Martindale says.\n\nStruggles come alive, she says, when we say them out loud. Instead, if you’re a parent or a coach, tell your athlete: “I really believe in you. Just keep throwing, you'll get it back, you'll find a rhythm.”\n\nWhen kids feel deep-rooted support, they have more confidence in themselves.\n\nMartindale says today’s world for young athletes is like taking the SATs while your score is being put on a scoreboard.\n\nSometimes, it seems, we expect our kids to be good at everything. Martindale asks the ones with whom she works, “What class are you good at?”\n\nShe doesn’t necessarily mean classes in which they have an “A,” but the ones they enjoy most.\n\nSometimes it takes looking at things through a less critical lens. We have an “A” in science, but we enjoy the challenge of English Lit, in which we have a B-, which energizes us to try and bring up the grade.\n\nEugene Glisky, Martindale’s father, had his ashes buried on the field where he coached near Toronto. She suspects he changed the lives of many young men.\n\nBut she stops short of calling a team a family.\n\n“When a coach says to a parent, ‘I'm gonna treat your son or daughter like my own,' I want to say, ‘No, thank you. I don't need you to treat my son like he’s your own,’ ” Martindale says. “He has a great father. What I really want you to do is treat him like a player and a human being.\n\n“It's a team, which is amazing and I love my kid being part of a team. But it's not a family. Why? Because what happens when your family cuts you?”\n\nThere are times when we need to be Coach, and times when we need to be Mom or Dad. Martindale had to be Coach when Judson, her oldest who now plays basketball for Manchester Basketball Club in the United Kingdom, came out of a game when he was younger and looked at her like, “Why are you pulling me?\n\nHe threw his water bottle, and she turned and said: \"You can take your sneakers off. You're done.\"\n\nThe same coach, though, drove him home from a different game, criticizing him for what he didn’t do while failing to realize he was sick.\n\n\"So many examples of total failure by me,\" she says. \"What kind of mother would be talking to their kid about some offensive set when clearly they needed a mother?\"\n\nLevy, North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, does parent Zoom calls. Before the first one, she asked her players what they wanted her to tell them.\n\n“They said, ‘We don’t want to talk about the game at the tailgate after,’ ” Levy told Martindale. “ ‘We don’t want any parent to have this sad conversation after the wins because their kid didn’t play. We want the parents to sit together. We want them to be positive on the sideline.’ ”\n\nLevy says the players gave her a Letterman top 10 of parent no-no’s, which she shared on the Zoom.\n\n“I think they were pretty shocked,” says Levy, who coaches her daughter, Kate, on the team. “Our kids were like, ‘Last year was not OK. This is what we want and this is what we need this year.’\n\n“And then if we saw it, I had permission from our players to call the parent and say, ‘Hey, you’re at the tailgate and your behavior was below the line for our program.’\n\n“What if I acted like that as a parent? What if I did that in the middle of a tailgate?”\n\nLevy’s point: A kid could be completely happy but if the parent is unhappy with their role, then the kid’s unhappy. And if the parent isn’t feeling like their kid is getting a fair shake, or they’re being really negative toward coaches or teammates, the kid internalizes the feeling.\n\n“Your influence is not neutral, parents,” Levy says.\n\nDuring a clip Martindale shared of her speaking to athletes, she says, “There has to be wins in there. Otherwise, you can't go an entire season and be like, ‘If we don't win a game, this whole season is a waste.’ ”\n\nShe is not necessarily talking about checks in the “W” column as much as what we perceive as personal wins. Maybe you tell a teammate you loved the way he blocked a punt or moved into position on defense. If we don’t have wins, even within losses, you don’t learn how to win.\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nMartindale believes there are five pillars of mental fitness: 1. Staying in the moment; 2. Controlling the controllables; 3. Seeing mistakes as opportunities; 4. Not judging yourself (or others) too harshly and 5. Comparison (positively).\n\nShe says she was once a failure at all of them. Has she since learned a special ingredient we need to have to play college sports?\n\nMartindale thinks Angela Duckworth, director of the Penn-Wharton Behavior Change for Good Initiative, said it best.\n\n“It’s grit,” Martindale has said. “I'm obsessed with grit, because we know it's a single defining characteristic of successful people.\n\n“Can you get up after you get knocked down? The athletes who are successful at every level of college, I think, have this kind of dog mentality that is about grit. And of course, you have to be skilled and you have to be athletic but when we really look at who performs best when it counts, it's people who have failed. Over and over and over. And then now they succeed.”\n\nWe can’t beat our kids up over mistakes. Let them hear the voice in their head that gives them the grace to move forward from them.\n\nThen, as Martindale says: “Watch them fail and then watch what they do after they fail.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., beating Vance by 51% to 49%.\n\nWhen broken down by demographic, Ocasio-Cortez leads Vance among Black voters (79% to 21%), Hispanic voters (64% to 36%), voters who have a college education (56% to 44%), voters aged 18 to 29 (58% to 42%), voters aged 30 to 44 (51% to 49%) and women voters (56% to 44%).\n\nVance, meanwhile, leads among white voters (57% to 43%), voters aged 65 and older (52% to 48%), voters without a college education (51% to 49%) and voters who are men (54% to 46%).\n\nBoth politicians are tied at 50% with voters aged 45 to 64, according to the poll.\n\nThe poll was conducted between Dec. 5 to Dec. 11 with a sample size of 1,521 registered voters.

Gavin Newsom as the front-runner. In a previous interview with CBS News, Newsom said he would consider a presidential campaign after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nAn Echelon Insights poll released Dec. 16 shows Newsom as the top pick for Democratic voters, with 23% of respondents saying they would vote for him in a primary. Behind Newsom is former Vice President Kamala Harris with 22%, followed by former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg with 11%. Ocasio-Cortez placed behind Buttigieg with 9% support.\n\nThe poll was conducted between Dec. 11 and Dec. 15. Of the 1,011 voters who responded to the poll, 498 were surveyed for the hypothetical 2028 Democratic primary matchup.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe University of Texas athletic department has been ranked the most valuable in college sports for 2025, according to a CNBC valuation released this week. Texas’s program is estimated at $1.48 billion, a 16% increase from the prior year and enough to vault the Longhorns past leader Ohio State.\n\nOhio State which held the top spot in last year’s ranking, slipped to second despite a 2% valuation increase, landing at approximately $1.35 billion.\n\nCNBC’s reporter Michael Ozanian values the 75 most valuable college athletic programs at a combined $51.2 billion, up 13% from 2024. The surge reflects escalating revenue streams, including media rights, sponsorships and the expanding impact of name, image and likeness (NIL) deals for student-athletes.\n\nTexas A&M retains the No. 3 spot at roughly $1.32 billion, while Georgia and Michigan round out the top five, each valued at about $1.16 billion. Notre Dame is sixth at $1.13 billion, followed by Tennessee at $1.12 billion and USC at $1.10 billion. Alabama and Nebraska are also among the top 10, all topping the $1 billion threshold.\n\nOf the top 25 athletic departments, 12 programs hail from the Southeastern Conference, with multiple SEC schools valued above $1.3 billion. Oregon sit just below the billion-dollar mark, despite a lucrative tie to Nike.\n\nThe widening valuations demonstrate how the business of college sports continues to grow, fueled largely by football revenues and lucrative conference television deals. The rise of NIL compensation packages has further broadened the financial abilities of elite programs, with some universities leveraging star athletes to enhance revenue and marketability.\n\nThe annual valuation shows a shifting landscape in collegiate athletics, where financial muscle increasingly figures into competitive balance and strategic planning across the four major conferences.\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nPat McAfee delivers reality check to Diego Pavia for Heisman weekend antics\n\nFernando Mendoza won't keep the Heisman Trophy\n\nWhy LSU should be extremely nervous about Michigan firing Sherrone Moore",

    "description": "The College Football Playoff (CFP) kicks off tonight with Oklahoma vs Alabama! Here’s how you can watch each matchup, including tonight’s SEC rematch:",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoffs are finally underway this weekend, as some of the top teams in the country do battle for a shot for a national title. With three teams in the playoff, the Big Ten is well represented, but two of those three teams sit on a bye week as the top two programs in the country. One, the Oregon Ducks, play on Saturday against James Madison.\n\nHere’s how you can watch that game and the other four that take place this weekend.\n\nWeather: 49 degrees, partly cloudy\n\nThis game will wrap up the first-round slate, and Vegas really likes a landslide victory for the Ducks.\n\nBob Chesney, JMU’s head coach, is prepping to leave after this run to coach UCLA and has a foot out of the door already. While the Dukes cruised through Sun Belt play to an 11-1 record, they lost at Louisville, their only Power 4 opponent, by two touchdowns back in Week 2. Many are counting them out of this game, but they boasted both a top-10 offense and defense in the country.\n\nOregon should win this game, but if it sneaks back to 21.5 points again like it has a few times over the last few days, I’ll likely take the Dukes and the points.\n\nWeather: 65 degrees, partly cloudy\n\nAnother playoff game, another two programs who are playing with head coaching chaos. Lane Kiffin’s ugly exit with Ole Miss has already happened, while Tulane’s Jon Sumrall will head to Florida once this CFP run is over.\n\nThe Green Wave lost two games this season, including a blowout at Ole Miss in Week 4. This one goes similarly, even without Kiffin, as the Rebels are clearly the much better team.\n\nThe play: Ole Miss -17.5 (-110)\n\nWeather: 67 degrees, partly cloudy\n\nMike Elko’s Aggies were perfect through their first 11 games, but a loss at Texas in the final game of the season has brought up some questions for this team.\n\nThere is a common opponent for these two teams — Notre Dame, a team considered snubbed despite a 10-2 record. Both squads won late over the Irish by a field goal or less. Despite missing the ACC Championship, Miami was playing its best football in the final four weeks. If I was playing a side, it would likely be the Hurricanes. I think this is the best game of the weekend and I expect a shootout despite the total shrinking from 52.5 at open to 48.5. Give me the over.\n\nThe first game of the CFP is a rematch, as Oklahoma went to Tuscaloosa and beat Alabama, 23-20, earlier this season. Oklahoma was without star edge R Mason Thomas in that game, and quarterback John Mateer was battling an injury. This time around, there are some rumblings that Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson may not be fully healthy. It’s going to be a fascinating game, but I think the Crimson Tide are the better team and that they win this game.\n\nOverall record: 31-32 (-2.18 units)",

We have previously discussed some Alabama prospects like Kadyn Proctor, Tim Keenan III, Deontae Lawson, and Keon Sabb. The Cincinnati Bengals could be looking to add a cornerback to replace Cam Taylor-Britt going into next year. Alabama’s Domani Jackson could be a player who intrigues the Bengals. He feels like a player that could go anywhere from rounds three to five during the draft this year. While he hasn’t had the season that many expected, he is still a solid draft prospect. He is expected to run a 4.3 40-yard dash or potentially even lower. Jackson is a great athlete with return ability, an excellent run defender, and rarely misses a tackle. He has an incredible 2.6% missed tackle rate on the 2025 season.\n\nDomani Jackson (Alabama CB #1)\n-Uses his long frame to force receivers off of their route and disrupt timing of the play\n-Shows scheme flexibility and is capable in both man and zone coverage\n-Has moments where his build and toughness align effectively as a true bump and run… pic.twitter.com/CYIsf4ShLT\n\n— Owen Denny (@OwenDennyNFL) December 4, 2025\n\nOklahoma has a plethora of defensive talent that should be of interest to the Bengals. We have mentioned previously R.Mason Thomas, Robert Spears-Jennings, Kip Lewis, and Gracen Halton. Another player on that defense worth mentioning for the 2026 NFL Draft is Damonic Williams. Williams is a day three space eating defensive tackle. Williams is listed at 6’1” and 323 pounds. He does his best work as a run defender in the middle of the Sooners defense. Williams originally spent a couple of seasons playing for TCU.\n\nDamonic Williams about to wreck SEC O-Lines! 😤\n pic.twitter.com/veDDTDhX1n\n\n— The Main Line (@TheMainLinePod) May 3, 2024\n\nTexas A&M has a lot of talent in the trenches on both sides of the ball. Cashius Howell, Tyler Onyedim, and Albert Regis headline the defensive line. On the offensive line they are loaded with draft-elibile talent like Trey Zuhn III, Dametrious Crownover, Chase Bisontis, and Ar’maj Reed-Adams. If the Bengals decide to not re-sign Dalton Risner, they may look once again toward the draft for a right guard. While that isn’t a guarantee with Jalen Rivers here, it is at least worth mentioning. Reed-Adams is a right guard prospect that could come in and compete to start early. He is a mauling presence on the interior that loves to finish plays, sometimes to his own detriment with penalties. That type of nasty is something this Cincinnati team is missing.\n\nAr’maj Reed-Adams is a DAWG at Right Guard (even took some Right Tackle snaps in this one) pic.twitter.com/tmBzRySVIh\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) May 8, 2025\n\nMiami is equally as impressive on both sides of the ball in the trenches. On offense, they have Francis Mauigoa, Markel Bell, Anez Cooper, and James Brockermyer. On the defensive line they have Rueben Bain Jr., Ahmad Moten Sr., and Akheem Mesidor. Mesidor is an older prospect that will be turning 25 years old. We have seen previously with the pick of Demetrius Knight Jr., that age may not scare the Bengals off from taking an older guy on day two. Mesidor has 30 career sacks between his time at West Virginia and Miami. When healthy, he is an explosive pass rusher with a quick first step and a variety of pass rush moves in his arsenal. He has a 29.9% win rate on true pass sets during the 2025 season.\n\nAkheem Mesidor (#3) Miami vs. Notre Dame – Mesidor will turn 25 years old in April and has put up 7 sacks, 43 pressures, and 4 forced fumbles so far this season. \n\nAt 6’3” 280 pounds he offers inside and outside versatility along the defensive line. He is a high effort player,… pic.twitter.com/gZ8wqkZ7aS\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) November 26, 2025\n\nOle Miss will be entering this game without former head coach Lane Kiffin. Kiffin will not be coaching in the playoffs after taking the LSU job. Ole Miss still has a ton of talented players and should easily handle Tulane this weekend. Zxavian Harris is a big-bodied defensive tackle I have previously discussed. They also have Dae’quan Wright, Harrison Wallace III, and De’Zhaun Stribling as offensive weapons. Another player that continues to intrigue me is Suntarine Perkins. The Bengals have tried to use Demetrius Knight Jr. as a player that can come off the edge at times with limited results. While Knight did put up two sacks this week, it was while playing the role of a spy on Lamar Jackson. If they want a player with real pass rush juice from the linebacker position, Perkins may be there guy. Perkins had 10.5 sacks last season while playing more on the edge. This year, he has just two sacks but has shown that he can play more as an off-ball linebacker, which he needed to do at only 6’1” 210 pounds.\n\nOle Miss's Suntarine Perkins might be my favorite prospect I watched all summer. Can't remember someone his size (6-1, 210) playing on the line of scrimmage in a major conference and still being a difference maker. \n\nDon't care where he plays, I want him on my football team pic.twitter.com/EAjzxQJC8Q\n\n— Mike Renner (@mikerenner_) July 30, 2025\n\nFor Tulane, there really isn’t much to talk about for the draft. Quarterback Jake Retzlaff is a transfer from BYU that might get a camp invitation. He is unlikely to be on a roster in the NFL next year. The best prospect for them is defensive tackle/defensive end Santana Hopper, but it sounds like he will be entering the transfer portal and remaining in college football next year.\n\nTulane first-team all-conference DL Santana Hopper is expected to enter the transfer portal following the College Football Playoff, sources tell @On3sports. \n\nHas 13 career sacks. https://t.co/wMrfFrcNOy pic.twitter.com/rOyVZFN4v7\n\n— Pete Nakos (@PeteNakos) December 16, 2025\n\nAnother contest that is likely to be heavily one sided features Oregon taking on James Madison. Oregon has a ton of draft-eligible talent including Dante Moore (QB), Noah Whittington (RB), Kenyon Sadiq (TE), Isaiah World (OT), Alex Harkey (OT), Emmanuel Pregnon (OG), Iapani Laloulu (OC), Matayo Uiagalelei (DE), Bear Alexander (DT), A’Mauri Washington (DT), Bryce Boettcher (LB), Jadon Canady (CB), and Dillon Thieneman (S). Thieneman is the most likely player that could end up a Cincinnati Bengal. The rangy safety prospect has good straight-line speed and has been highly productive for both Purdue and Oregon during his time in college football.\n\nDillon Thieneman vs. Indiana pic.twitter.com/WEel3shdxI\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) November 20, 2025\n\nSimilar to Tulane, there really isn’t much for James Madison as far as draft prospects for this year. Wayne Knight is probably the best prospect on their team. However, the running back is listed at just 5’7”. He is listed at weighing around 190 pounds and has shown impressive contact balance. Knight has rushed for almost 1300 yards in 2025. He has also added almost 400 more yards as a receiver. Knight will have to play out of his mind against Oregon for James Madison to even keep this one close.\n\nJust incredible contact balance from James Madison’s Wayne Knight to pop through here.\n\nHe’s top three in the Sun Belt in rushing yards after contact pic.twitter.com/6IELz0SmUM\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) December 6, 2025",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nQuarterback Dylan Raiola continues to be a hot-buttoned topic around the college football community, especially given his reported decision to enter the transfer portal.\n\nTeams have started to emerge as possible new spots for Raiola, but according to ESPN's Greg McElroy, one of them seems like an easy choice.\n\n\"If Dante Moore does decide to go to the NFL, well then, the Oregon Ducks offer a place that could be a perfect landing spot,\" McElroy said on \"Always College Football.\"\n\nBut it's much bigger.

    "fullText": "After a whole month of controversy with former head coach Lane Kiffin, the Ole Miss Rebels are finally back on the playing field, hoping to continue the best season in program history.\n\nThey face a familiar matchup this weekend against a Tulane team that they blew out 45-10 earlier this year, and should cruise through their first round College Football Playoff game on Saturday.\n\nThey’re a significant favorite and deservedly so. They outgained the Green Wave by nearly 250 yards in the first matchup, while completely shutting down their passing attack. Offensively, Trinidad Chambliss and Co. were dominant, throwing for over 300 yards while getting 241 more on the ground.\n\nOle Miss scored on eight of its first nine possessions, and Tulane just had no answers defensively. But, the blowout win did show a glaring concern: Ole Miss’s run defense.\n\nThe Rebels could not contain the Tulane ground game, as the Green Wave went for 178 yards on 4.6 yards per carry. And that wasn’t a one-game problem.\n\nAfter being a dominant force up front in 2024, ranking first in rushing yards allowed per game (85.1) and in yards allowed per carry (2.4), Ole Miss has significantly slipped this season. They rank 71st in rushing yards allowed per game (157.1), while being 92nd in yards allowed per carry (4.7).\n\nNow, the issue hasn’t shown up as much this year because Ole Miss’s offense has been elite, and the pass defense has been a top-30 unit in the country this year.\n\nBut, in Ole Miss’s close games this season, they struggled to defend the run. Against Kentucky early in the year, they allowed 172 rushing yards and 4.6 yards per carry. Arkansas went for 221 yards and four scores on six yards per carry in Ole Miss’s 41-35 win. Washington State had 127 yards on 4.5 yards a carry. Oklahoma went for 136 yards and two scores on nearly five yards a carry.\n\nThen, there’s Georgia, who went for 221 yards and a touchdown on the ground in Ole Miss’s lone loss of the year. And that’s who the Rebels will play in the second round of the Playoff, assuming they beat Tulane.\n\nNow, the Rebels are still a stellar 11-1 in the SEC. They’ve managed to win behind that elite defense and good pass defense. And they should run through Tulane this weekend, whose defense can’t keep up with Ole Miss.\n\nBut, if there’s a reason why Ole Miss’s magical season might end earlier than fans hope, it’s the run defense, which can certainly be a prevalent issue against the top teams in the country.",

She enrolled, then inspired her mother, a Starbucks store manager, to join her, turning a workplace perk into a two-generation push toward a goal neither woman thought was financially in reach.\n\n\"I didn't think college was going to be an option because of how much it costs with loans and things like that,\" Yancey, who celebrated her graduation on Monday, told Business Insider. \"I know it's going to make all the difference in the world not having to worry about that.\"\n\nYancey pursued a degree in interdisciplinary arts and performance, with the goal of becoming a music teacher. Her mother graduated last semester with a degree in interdisciplinary studies, concentrating in sales, marketing, and project management.\n\n\"I'm glad that she got to finish school, because that's all she ever wanted, and she stopped originally because she got pregnant with me, but now we finished it together,\" Yancey said.\n\nAs college costs have soared, so has enrollment in Starbucks' College Achievement Plan (SCAP) program, Chief People Officer Sara Kelly told Business Insider. The program, which began in 2014, offers eligible employees 100% upfront tuition coverage for their first bachelor's degree, facilitated through online classes at ASU.\n\n\"Over the last five years, we've seen a 60% increase in participation,\" Kelly said. \"We have 13% of our partners participating as scholars today.\"\n\nThat represents at least one enrolled Starbucks staff member at about 90% of its coffeehouses, Kelly added.\n\nStarbucks isn't the only retail or Fortune 500 employer offering education benefits. Amazon, Walmart, and Chipotle also offer similar programs. However, compared to most programs in the US retail sector, Starbucks doesn't require reimbursement of tuition payments or require students to stay with the company for a certain amount of time after graduation.\n\nYounger students are increasingly questioning the value of a college degree. A May 2024 Deloitte survey found that a third of Gen Z and millennials chose to skip higher education due to rising costs, and the average price of attendance for a student living on campus at an in-state public 4-year institution is $108,584 over 4 years, according to Educationdata — so you can't beat free.\n\n\"This started over 10 years ago, all in service of creating access to education, and the importance of creating access to education,\" Kelly said. \"College is incredibly costly, and so how do we create access to that education for all of our partners? So we're really proud, because we see this as one of the most powerful expressions of our investment in our partners.\"\n\nStarbucks has expanded the SCAP program in recent years, offering access to more than 150 degree pathways, providing enrolled students with a broader range of fields to pursue than in the program's early years. They've also added a \"Pathway to Admission\" support route for partners who don't initially qualify for university admission, allowing them to take preparatory courses and earn their way into ASU. Additionally, a \"plus-one\" benefit is available for eligible military and veteran partners, extending SCAP to a qualifying family member.\n\nThis year, Starbucks introduced new study abroad and coffee education opportunities, offering a hands-on sustainability immersion at Hacienda Alsacia in Costa Rica, where scholars study climate, agronomy, and the future of coffee at their global research and development farm.\n\nOf course, the students aren't the only ones benefiting. The program is a significant retention win for Starbucks. Turnover is at record lows, Kelly said, and baristas who have spoken to Business Insider frequently cite the SCAP program as a reason they've stayed with the company.\n\nThe program also helps to strengthen Starbucks' talent pipeline, as the company has committed to a 90% internal hire rate or fill rate for its retail leadership roles.\n\n\"Our Starbucks college achievement plan partners are part of our pipeline for those management roles, and we're very excited about that,\" Kelly said. \"But do they have to stay with Starbucks? No.\"\n\nStarbucks has never considered adding a retention requirement to the program, Kelly said, because the company wants \"to offer access to education that people can take with them on their journey, no matter where it takes them.\"\n\nFor Yancey, her Starbucks journey is winding down, but it's not over. She continues to work part-time as a barista and has a second job as a music instructor, while planning her next career moves.\n\n\"They find a way to make it work for whoever wants to go into the university through the SCAP program; they find a way for you to complete it,\" Yancey said. \"I don't think finances or learning ability should hold anybody back, and they really delivered on that.\"",

    "fullText": "Two years after the Supreme Court effectively ended race-conscious college admissions nationwide, Johns Hopkins University has seen a significant change in the racial makeup of its freshman class, according to newly released enrollment data.\n\nSince 2023, the number of Asian first-year undergraduate students, as measured by federal reporting standards, has risen nearly 20 percentage points, to 45.1% from 25.6%. Black first-year student representation, meanwhile, has been cut in half, dropping to 4% from 9.8%, as has the Hispanic student population, which fell to 10.1% this year from 20.8% two years ago. White freshman enrollment remained relatively flat, at 21% in 2025, compared with 19.3% in 2023. Those self-reporting as white fell more sharply to 30.9% from 39.1%.\n\nThe data offer a clear, local snapshot of how elite universities may be changing in the wake of the 2023 ruling, which prohibited schools from considering race in admissions. While universities across the country warned the decision could reduce racial diversity, Johns Hopkins’ numbers show an especially stark shift.\n\n“Since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in [Students for Fair Admissions] v Harvard, we have been navigating an evolving legal and regulatory environment,” said university spokesman J.B. Bird in an email to the Baltimore Sun. “We continue to work on opening our doors as wide as possible to students from all backgrounds and perspectives.”\n\nThe research university has seen some success in its efforts to diversify by income level, regardless of race. The 2025 freshman class has the highest-ever number of Pell grant recipients, at 24.1%, up slightly from 23.8% last year and 21.6% the year before. First-generation college student admission remained flat from last year at 20.3% percent, but up from 19.4% in 2023. Both Pell grant recipients and first-generation college students had risen steadily since 2010.\n\nThe university’s new Tuition Promise program could also increase diversity in the coming years, said Amelia, a second-year graduate student who declined to give her last name.\n\nThe program, which begins next year, with January admissions, offers a free education to students whose families earn less than $200,000, and includes living expenses for those making less than $100,000.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision is already changing higher education in more ways than student body demographics can reveal, said Bryan Cook higher education policy director of the nonpartisan Urban Institute think tank. Johns Hopkins is not unique, though the court’s decision more strongly impacted private, elite college and universities that had been trying to recruit more diverse student bodies, Cook said. Schools like community colleges that accept all applications, and state schools that rely primarily on test scores for admissions, would not be affected, he said.\n\nA lot of institutions are having to make significant changes in their policies,” Cook said. “In many cases, this is already changing the demographics of what campuses look like.”\n\nIt’s difficult to determine the whole story, he said, admissions data only shows part of what is happening.\n\n“We know nothing about the demographics of their applicant pool and how that might line up with admissions,” Cook explained. “We don’t know what’s happening universally across all schools.”\n\nThe Urban Institute reached out to universities to request applicant data to improve their understanding, publishing their findings in July of 2025.\n\n“Early analysis from 18 institutions suggests that Black students’ share of the applicant pool increased more between 2023 and 2024 than in any of the prior five years,” the report states, “but their share of the admitted student pool held constant or even decreased. Furthermore, an increasing number of applicants have chosen not to disclose their race or ethnicity.”\n\nAmong elite universities, those admitting less than half of their applicants, Black student admissions fell to 5.9% in 2024 from 6.6% in 2023, while Black admissions at less selective schools remained level.\n\nMost Americans support fair admissions, said Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, the organization that brought the lawsuit against Harvard, resulting in the Supreme Court decision.\n\n“Credible polling from across the political spectrum indicates that Americans agree that a student’s race or ethnicity should not be considered as a factor in whether that student is accepted or rejected at any university,” Blum said.\n\nHopkins student Aaden, who asked to only be identified by his first name.\n\n“I believe it is important to have a diverse student body,” said Aaden, a third-year chemistry student, “although I think if we were picking people because of their race, it’s not fair to Asian and white students. People with lower grades might be picked because of their race.”\n\nAaden lives in Florida, where his parents immigrated from the Caribbean. He said he hasn’t experienced racism on campus but understands how new Black and Hispanic students might feel more isolated this year.\n\nMaria Laskaris, a college counselor from TopTier Admissions, helps students prepare for and get into schools best suited for their needs, beginning younger than high school age. She agreed that the Supreme Court ruling affects primarily highly selective private institutions, but said the changes would not necessarily change how she advises minority student clients.\n\n“I would make sure that any student I advise is aware of the landscape in which they are applying to college and various policies of the colleges they’re interested in,” she said. “It’s about how you set yourself apart. What do you bring to the table that makes you stand out from other applicants?”\n\nTricia Bishop contributed to this report.\n\nHave a news tip?

    "description": "In an era where international talent is at an all-time high, it might be hard to believe that it’s only been just over two decades since Utah’s Andrew Bogut became the first foreign-born winner of the John R. Wooden Award.",
    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it's 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nIn an era where international talent is at an all-time high, it might be hard to believe that it’s only been just over two decades since Utah’s Andrew Bogut became the first foreign-born winner of the John R. Wooden Award.\n\nBogut’s 2004-05 sophomore campaign with the Utes placed him into an exclusive club of college basketball history, as he led the program to the Sweet 16 in the years immediately after longtime head coach and program builder Rick Majerus left the program and received consensus national player of the year honors as a result.\n\nIn the Utes’ first season under Ray Giacolletti, Bogut averaged 20.5 points and 12.2 rebounds per game to lead the team to a 25-4 regular season record overall, with a 13-1 mark in Mountain West play. Bogut’s most impressive outing of the season was a 31-point, 13-rebound clinic in a 71-62 conference win over Wyoming on Valentine’s Day, where he made 11-of-16 attempts from the field.\n\nThe Utes would eventually fall to New Mexico in the 2005 Mountain West championship game, but still received a No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament as an at-large. Bogut continued his dominance in the first round of March Madness, pouring in 24 points on 9-of-13 shooting to lead Utah over a feisty No. 11 seed in UTEP before beating No. 3 seed Oklahoma in the Round of 32.\n\nIn the days after Bogut’s college career ended with a loss to Kentucky in the 2005 Sweet 16, he was awarded the Wooden Award with a decisive finish in the voting ahead of Duke’s JJ Redick and Illinois’ Dee Brown. Being from Australia, Bogut wasn’t too familiar with Coach Wooden’s legacy when he won the award but he still cherished the honor all the same.\n\n\"I'd heard the name before. College basketball isn't very big in Australia,\" Bogut told the Associated Press after winning the award in 2005. \"He's a legendary coach -- one of the best of all-time … It's very special just to have my name engraved on that trophy with the likes of Larry Bird, Michael Jordan and Tim Duncan.”\n\nBogut joined another very exclusive club in basketball history a few months later, as the Milwaukee Bucks selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. Bogut played 14 seasons in the NBA, winning a championship with the Golden State Warriors in 2015 in addition to earning third-team All-NBA honors with the Bucks in 2010.",

    "description": "Freshman forward Sienna Betts, sister of Lauren Betts, made her long awaited debut in a historically high scoring game by the Bruins.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - No. 4 UCLA had by far their best scoring game of the season Tuesday night when they took to the court against the Cal Poly Mustangs and turned in one of their best defensive performances too, finishing the game with a massive 115-28 final score in favor of the Bruins.\n\nIt was UCLA's first triple digit finish of the season and the 87 point margin of victory was the fourth-largest in program history and the largest in the NCAA era.\n\nWhat made the Bruins eclipsing the 100-point threshold that much more impactful was the player who did it. With just under seven minutes to go, freshman forward Sienna Betts spun, stepped back and sank a midrange shot for her fifth point of the game and UCLA's 101st.\n\nBetts, the younger sister of superstar UCLA senior center Lauren Betts, made her long-awaited debut Tuesday night after being kept out of the season so far with an injury. She was subbed in midway through the first quarter and Pauley Pavilion roared as over a month of anticipation was finally released.\n\nFor the Betts sisters, it was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.\n\n\"I just felt super jolly. I was just so happy to be on the court with her. She's just done a lot of work and I know that this process hasn't been easy, but just to have that moment with her, this is something that we've grown up dreaming about, so to be at this level and to be on the court with her is really amazing.\"\n\nIt's been a long road to this point for the younger Betts. Close has spoken at length this season about the drive that Betts has and the disappointment that Betts has felt not being able to be on the court. Still just a freshman, that intense drive can be a spark plug for success, but it can also be straining mentally. Close has made it an important mission to guide Betts through that, and reminding her not only of her talent, but of her value both as a person and a player.\n\n\"I know who Sienna Betts is and I know how good she's going to be,\" head coach Cori Close said at halftime. \"I just want her to give herself some grace right now. She's trying to do everything all at once. She has done a heck of a job in how she's returned to play, what's she's been learning... how she will continue to improve even though it's not the way she wanted too or planned.\"\n\nNow that her first game is behind her, one of two things can happen for Betts. Either the pressure is off her shoulders and she can simply focus on moving forward, or the liklier option, she'll ramp up the intensity as much as she can now that she's got a taste of college ball.\n\n\"Sometimes an overused strength becomes a weakness. And her strength is  she demands a very high level of herself all the time. But, when you over use that or it gets out of balance it can also hold you back. So, I'm encouraging her to think about process, encouraging her to write down all of the things she did well... She made so many maturation steps over this last six or seven weeks. It's hard. If it was easy everyone would do it.\"",

    "description": "There was no shortage of drama this college football season, but how will it close out and who will hoist the championship trophy? Our experts give their picks.",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff has finally arrived — games were played, decisions were made and controversy reigned once again.\n\nThere was no shortage of drama this college football season. With the precipitous falloff of teams like Penn State, Clemson and LSU, the door was opened for newcomers like Tulane, James Madison and punchy little upstart Alabama.\n\nThe most controversial decision the CFP committee made was placing three-loss Alabama and two-loss Miami into the field and leaving Notre Dame out. That's despite the Tide getting shellshocked in the SEC title game and the Hurricanes being ranked behind the Irish since the very first set of rankings came out.\n\nBut alas, the CFP bracket is set, and 12 teams remain. Who will win it all?\n\nOur team of college football experts breaks it all down with their picks for every playoff game. Feel free to disagree, or to make your own picks in the comments below.\n\nA year ago, we saw Ohio State lose its final game before the playoff and then run through the field in one of the greatest postseason winning streaks in the history of the sport. This year, the Buckeyes lost to Indiana in the Big Ten championship game — a defeat that we believe will launch Ryan Day and Co. into another postseason run.\n\nThe Buckeyes are just too talented and playing too good of defense not to run through this field. That pick shouldn't surprise you, but how about my pick for runner-up: the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Tech's front seven is good enough to knock off Big Ten foes Oregon and Indiana and advance to the title bout.\n\nThings got tough for me in the semifinal round. The first two rounds are pretty straightforward. Alabama over Oklahoma was nearly a coin flip, but it feels like Oklahoma's luck is going to run out with an offense that needs to be better. I think Miami has enough to take down Texas A&M, even with new Kansas State coach Collin Klein still calling plays for the Aggies.\n\nAll four top seeds should win in the quarterfinals. The closest game could be the rematch between Ole Miss and Georgia. In the semifinals ... I went back and forth a lot. I think each of the top four seeds is more than capable of winning the national title. Texas Tech upsetting Indiana isn't a statement against the Hoosiers. I have no doubts about how good they are. I just wonder if the loss of Stephen Daley will loom large at some point in the playoff.\n\nOhio State vs. Georgia could be the game of the year and I'm not going to be surprised if it comes down to a late field goal once again. In the title game, I have to go with the Buckeyes over the Red Raiders. Tech's defense has been so, so good at forcing turnovers. But Ohio State's ability to protect the football — the Buckeyes have just nine turnovers in 13 games — will be the difference.\n\nWith the amount of time teams have to prepare, the first round of the playoff should go according to form with home teams holding serve. The one possible exception could be in Norman, where Oklahoma has to beat Alabama for a second time this season to advance. Asking any team to beat a quality opponent twice in a row is difficult in college football, but Alabama's specific weakness — running the football — plays into the hands of Oklahoma's defense to such a degree that the Sooners have a real edge in the matchup.\n\nI also expect to see a reversal from last year, where the four teams that got byes into the quarterfinal all lost. If you talk to enough coaches, they would rather have the extra week of rest over playing a first-round game, so this trend should start to even out soon. A lot of people will pick Oregon to beat Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl, but that defense is going to present real problems for the Ducks. It's hard to envision another Georgia quarterfinal exit given the way they played down the stretch, and both Indiana and Ohio State have taken care of business all season against lesser teams.\n\nIf we get semifinal matchups with Georgia vs. Ohio State and Texas Tech vs. Indiana, we should all feel very lucky because that lineup would truly reflect the four most dominant teams of the year in college football. From there, it would be anybody's ballgame in terms of making the national championship.\n\nIt’s not how you start, it’s how you finish. And throughout this year, nobody has been better at finishing moves than Georgia. The Bulldogs turn boa constrictor in the second half of their games, encircling opponents and then smothering them. They’ll pull the same move in the playoffs, letting Indiana, Ohio State and Oregon get the early acclaim and then suffocating them deep in January. Georgia is ragged, Georgia has exploitable holes, but Georgia’s defense is like the sunset, inevitable and everywhere.\n\nThe playoff gives teams a chance to right wrongs from the regular season, and both Alabama and Oregon will take advantage. Alabama will look like a decent team against Oklahoma, and then validate everyone’s belief in their playoff unworthiness by getting waxed by Indiana.\n\nOregon will have little trouble with JMU and will overcome Texas Tech in the great Booster Battle, and will avenge a regular-season loss to Indiana in the semis.\n\nOhio State vs. Georgia will be the best game of the playoffs; it’s just the Buckeyes’ bad fortune to (again) meet the Dawgs in the semis rather than the finals.\n\nOf course, if my preseason predictions are any indication — I had Texas over Penn State in the title game — I would not recommend wagering any of your actual money on these picks. You’d be better off wagering on Notre Dame to win.\n\nAlabama is the first three-loss team to earn an at-large bid to the CFP. The Crimson Tide won’t let the opportunity go to waste. They’ll avenge their Nov. 15 loss to Oklahoma. If Ty Simpson can protect the ball and reestablish a rhythm, Alabama can dig Oklahoma a hole that it won’t be able to climb out of. The Sooners are averaging just 2.9 yards per carry over their past three games, and quarterback John Mateer — seemingly still affected by his early-season hand injury — has completed just 43.4% of his passes traveling 10-plus air yards in 2025, per PFF.\n\nMiami and Texas A&M will put on the best show of the opening round. The Hurricanes will have chances for big plays. The Aggies’ aggressive defense allowed touchdowns of 50 and 80 yards against South Carolina on Nov. 15 and touchdowns of 29 and 35 yards in the second half of its loss to Texas on Nov. 28. That’s music to the ears of do-it-all wide receiver Malachi Toney and quarterback Carson Beck, who has thrown only one pick in his past four games.\n\nOregon won’t have too much trouble against a pesky James Madison squad, but it will get a glimpse of what’s to come when it faces Sahir West, who stacked three sacks in the Sun Belt title game. That’s because the Ducks’ quarterfinal opponent will be Texas Tech. Bolstered by an elite pairing of linebackers, namely Jacob Rodriguez, the revamped Red Raiders are third nationally with just 3.96 yards per play allowed this season. That defense will deliver when it needs to versus Oregon. Speaking of awesome defenses, Indiana has one, too. The Hoosiers will put an end to an Alabama offense that’s been increasingly one-dimensional.\n\nOle Miss is my surprise pick. Pete Golding is a stabilizing force in Oxford, and he’ll be aided by the return of soon-to-be LSU offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. The Rebels are enjoying their best season in program history, and Lane Kiffin’s departure won’t interrupt that run. Behind a persistent run game and a fun passing attack engineered by Trinidad Chambliss, Ole Miss will outscore Georgia in a rematch of the team’s Oct. 18 meeting. That said, the Rebels’ storybook season will come to a halt against Ohio State, which will snap back into form versus Texas A&M following the Buckeyes’ Big Ten championship defeat.\n\nOhio State will get another crack at Indiana. First the Hoosiers will expose Texas Tech’s red-zone issues — the Red Raiders are a ghastly 101st nationally in touchdown percentage (56.2%) down there — thanks to a Bryant Haines defense that’s tied for fourth in sacks and ranks second in tackles for loss. Indiana got after Julian Sayin and confused him by disguising coverages. The Buckeyes will have a better plan this time around during a week that won’t involve a signing day scare and offensive coordinator Brian Hartline being named USF’s head coach. Ohio State was held to 10 points against Michigan last year before exploding offensively in the CFP. With star receivers Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate, there’s a good chance that happens again. Fernando Mendoza will win the Heisman, but Sayin will win the national title.",

    "description": "I'm trying to let my teen take the driver's seat as they apply to college. We only discuss college during designated times, and it's been challenging.",
    "fullText": "My fifth and final kid is a senior in high school, which means it's time for graduation, award nights, and most importantly, the college application process.\n\nAt a recent college night presentation, I met with a high school counselor. They gave all parents a startling message: You're not in the driver's seat during the application process. You're not even in the passenger seat. You're in the back seat.\n\nI took the counselor's advice and decided to step back, letting my teen take the lead as they apply to colleges. At times, this has been tough, but I keep reminding myself that this is their journey.\n\nThe post-secondary counselor talked with my child about their academic profile, major, and what they were looking for in a college. They discussed that even though my child has the background to get into highly selective (and very expensive) schools, they want to be a high school teacher, so it's not really necessary.\n\nTalking about money with kids is never fun. College is the most fraught money conversation we've had with our kids.\n\nIt was helpful to have another trusted adult discuss my child's preferences with them and help them figure out what matters most when selecting schools. Thankfully, I didn't have to be the one who directed them away from prestigious schools.\n\nI only stepped in to tell my kid how much I could afford on tuition.\n\nRather than continually nagging my kid about applications and to-do lists, I send out meeting invites to complete specific tasks, such as the FAFSA, campus visits, and scholarships.\n\nDuring these scheduled times, we sit at the kitchen table while my kid does the work. I'm available if they need me to complete forms or determine a suitable time for a campus visit.\n\nI then don't bring up college unless they do outside these scheduled times. This is hard. I'm curious to know what they're thinking and if everything is getting done. However, since we started scheduling times, my child is now proactively chatting instead of us having to ask.\n\nThe college application process teaches, sometimes the hard way, the importance of deadlines. Colleges have limits — a limited amount of scholarship money, a max on people admitted, a finite number of rooms in the best dorm — and waiting until or missing the deadline means you miss out.\n\nMy child lost out on presidential scholarships for one of their top schools because they were working to a deadline. The scholarship application process required a two-day in-person interview, and they discovered this the day before the application was due.\n\nWe couldn't make the in-person interview time, so they were unable to apply. It was frustrating, but, it was a lesson learned.\n\nWhen this presidential scholarship mishap happened, I realized how I could be helpful. I created a spreadsheet to compare schools and provide a quick view of deadlines for applications and scholarships.\n\nI'm not going into the Common App or looking over my kids' shoulders as they fill out applications. We review the spreadsheet during our college task meetings, and they get to work.\n\nI then do my best not to look at it, ask them questions, or nag them the rest of the week.\n\nI realized the best way I can stay involved is by celebrating my kids' wins.\n\nI take pictures on tours, read the brochures, and check out the acceptance packet swag. It's an exciting time for both of us, and this helps me feel more involved.\n\nEvery scholarship, every acceptance, regardless of amount or whether they choose that school, is a win and a testament to all we've both done to get to that point.",

    "description": "The Associated Press college football All-American Teams were announced on Monday and eight Ohio State players were named.",
    "fullText": "Now that the 2025 college football regular season is over, we are going to continue to hear about postseason awards and various All-American teams. One of the biggest of those is the Associated Press All-American team, and we saw that announced on Monday, with a lot of Ohio State players involved.\n\nIn total, eight Buckeyes were named across the three teams, with four of those keeping their hope alive in becoming consensus first-team All-Americans. Safety Caleb Downs, defensive tackle Kayden McDonald, linebacker Arvell Reese, and wide receiver Jeremiah Smith were all named to the first team, with all four already being named to the Walter Camp First-Team as well.\n\nBut that wasn't all, because four more Ohio State players appeared on other teams, with linebacker Sonny Styles and wide receiver Carnell Tate being named second-team All-Americans by the Associated Press, while defensive end Caden Curry and quarterback Julian Sayin appeared on the third team.\n\nSmith, widely known as the best receiver in the game, was snubbed for the Biletnikoff Award on Friday. He's caught 80 passes for 1,086 yards and 11 touchdowns. You can bet that he'll make more All-American lists going forward. Smith has had back-to-back 1,000-yard receiving seasons and still has his junior year to go.McDonald has flashed on the scene this year in the middle of the defensive line and is a potential first-round NFL draft pick come April. He clogs up the middle and has tallied 57 tackles with eight tackles for loss and three sacks.\n\nReese has also come out of nowhere to be considered one of the best linebackers in the country and also a potential first-round NFL draft pick. He has been used all over the field because of his ability to run and react to plays at several levels. He's had 62 tackles with ten tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks.Need a news break? Downs has already taken home the Jim Thorpe Award and is considered by many as the best defensive player in the game, though he did not win the Bednarik Award. Like Reese, he is one of the linchpins of the defense, often lining up at all three levels. He has registered 60 total tackles with five tackles for loss, two interceptions, and a sack so far this year.\n\n🥇Team AP All-Americans 🇺🇸 \n\n🏅 @caleb_downs2 \n🏅 @Jermiah_Smith1 \n🏅 @arvxll \n🏅 @KMac_DT pic.twitter.com/gpQQxNAAOb\n\n— Ohio State Football (@OhioStateFB) December 15, 2025\n\nThe announcement of All-American teams will continue on Tuesday when the AFCA team will be announced.

    "fullText": "The second weekend of December provided us with one of the best two-day stretches of the young 2025-26 men’s college basketball season so far.\n\nHere are the 10 teams that got the biggest boosts from the mid-December madness that just transpired.\n\nThe Johnnies had no problem with Iona in a 91-64 win that had special meaning to head coach Rick Pitino. After being essentially exiled from the sport following his dismissal at Louisville, Pitino was thrown a lifeline by Iona in 2021, and then led the Gaels to two NCAA Tournament appearances in three seasons.\n\n“Iona’s got a really good team,” Pitino said after the game. “Iona’s such a special place with great tradition. I owe them so much. We’re going to play this game every year that I’m the coach.”\n\nThe Buckeyes avoided what would have been a big hit to their early NCAA Tournament resume by roaring back from a 16-point second half deficit (regardless of what the tweet below says) and taking down West Virginia in double overtime.\n\nThese are the types of games and moments that are easy to gloss over in the dead of December, but often ultimately decide the last teams in or out of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nConference realignment might have ruined the football version of “Bedlam,” but props to the basketball programs for carrying the torch.\n\nLike Ohio State, Oklahoma really needed this win to keep a “ok, not great” early season resume before diving head first into a conference play gauntlet. The Sooners exploded for 13 made three-pointers to win their fourth consecutive game over Oklahoma State.\n\nYes, Kentucky finally got a win over a team with a pulse, but perhaps more importantly, the Wildcats avoided a loss that felt like it had the potential to push Big Blue Nation over the edge.\n\nThe Wildcats had been the most disappointing team in college basketball through the season’s first six weeks. The fan base did not love the way Mark Pope handled his first real dose of adversity. A home loss to a hated rival that every member of the UK program has looked down at for the entirety of their existence would have created a blue Christmas across the Commonwealth.\n\nIn his first game back from injury, Mo Dioubate was the ultimate difference-maker for Kentucky. The power forward transfer from Alabama scored 14 points and pulled down a season-high 12 rebounds in his first game action since Nov. 13. That’s a huge boost for a team that was in desperate need of one.\n\nThe Broncos continue their early recovery from one of the worst opening night losses in the history of college basketball, their 79-78 defeat at the hands of Division-II opponent Hawaii Pacific. Since then, Boise has taken two far more understandable losses (USC and NC State in Maui) and has knocked off Wichita State, Butler, and now Saint Mary’s in a 68-67 thriller on Sunday.\n\nSt. Mary’s gets a chance with 7 seconds left but an untimely slip from Joshua Dent spoils their plans and Boise State pulls off the upset 68-67 pic.twitter.com/H4vIDduLqA\n\n— NCAA Buzzer Beaters & Game Winners (@NCAABuzzerBters) December 15, 2025\n\nSuddenly, Boise State finds itself inside the top 40 at No. 39 in the latest NET Rankings. That’s the second-best ranking of any team from the Mountain West, trailing only No. 30 Utah State.\n\nThe Mountain West is down this season, so Boise will need to be near-perfect in conference play to have a shot at an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. Thanks to Sunday’s win, though, there is at least a path.\n\nThe Zags got the better of modern rival UCLA in a late-night neutral court battle in Seattle. Graham Ike’s 28 points and overall inside dominance proved to be the biggest difference, as Mark Few’s team withstood a strong shooting performance from the Bruins’ Tyler Bilodeau to win, 82-72.\n\nIf Gonzaga is able to take care of Oregon this Sunday, they’re almost certain to begin play in their final season as a member of the West Coast Conference with just one defeat (a 40-point blowout against Michigan in the Players Era Festival championship game). A gaudy overall record, a top 3 national seed, and a 752nd national debate over whether the Zags are actually good enough to win the national championship appears to be on the horizon for yet another March.\n\nIt’s nice for college basketball to have at least a few unvarying North Stars during this period of overwhelming change.\n\nIt feels a little wrong to call Kansas a “winner” after a weekend where star freshman Darryn Peterson was forced to leave the team’s game at NC State after appearing to aggravate the hamstring injury that has been bothering him since the beginning of the season. Still, the Jayhawks got a miraculous performance from Melvin Council Jr. as they outlasted the Wolfpack, 77-76 in overtime.\n\nCouncil, who said afterwards that the most three-pointers he’d ever made in a game at any level was “two or three,” buried a whopping nine triples and netted a career-high 36 points to keep KU from dropping its fourth game before Christmas.\n\nThe issue with Peterson — who reportedly said on Monday that his issue during the game wasn’t hamstring related — is still of significant concern, but this was a win that Kansas really needed to get in order to round out its non-conference resume. The Jayhawks now have a pretty light slate until the middle of January, which will hopefully give the superstar freshman ample time to heal whatever needs healing.\n\nAre the Razorbacks the best team in the SEC? They’re certainly playing like it.\n\nArkansas notched its second top 20 win in two weeks with a 93-86 triumph over No. 16 Texas Tech Saturday afternoon in Dallas. The win was extra sweet considering it came eight months after the Red Raiders eliminated John Calipari’s team from the NCAA Tournament with a soul-crushing overtime comeback in the Sweet 16.\n\nThe difference for Arkansas against Tech was the continued uptick in production from forward Trevon Brazile. The versatile 6’10 senior hit 4 of his 5 three-point attempts and scored 18 of his team-high 24 points in the second half to help the Razorbacks overcome a double-digit deficit. Brazile also added 10 rebounds.\n\nThe performance of Brazile, coupled with 20-point efforts by both Darius Acuff and Karter Knox, lifted Arkansas to victory despite a 30-point, 11-rebound effort from Texas Tech All-American JT Toppin.\n\nArkansas has one major test — a neutral court showdown against No. 7 Houston on Saturday — remaining before the start of conference play.\n\nBefore this weekend, Arizona already had the best resume in college basketball and a team that appeared fully capable of winning the program’s second national championship.\n\nNow, Tommy Lloyd appears to have unlocked the full potential of 5-star freshman Brayden Burries. That’s not great news for the rest of the Big 12.\n\nBurries, the No. 9 overall player in the 2025 recruiting class according to 247 Sports, averaged just 7.8 points in Arizona’s first five games this season, and didn’t score more than 5 points in the team’s spotlight wins over UConn, Florida and UCLA. Against Alabama on Saturday, the 6’4 shooting guard exploded for a career-high 28 points as the Wildcats stomped No. 12 Alabama in Birmingham, 96-75.\n\nBurries, who hit five three-pointers and was 11-of-19 from the field overall, scored 15 points in four minutes during a game-defining stretch in the second half. For a team whose lone weakness this season had seemed to be outside shooting, the Burries performance proved that Arizona can win big games in virtually any way it needs to.\n\nWith the win over ‘Bama, Arizona is now the first team in 30 years to have five wins over AP top 25 opponents in its first nine games of a season.\n\nNebrasketball secured the best start in the history of the program (11-0) with easily its most impressive win of the season (and arguably the most impressive win of the Fred Hoiberg era), with a thrilling 83-80 road triumph over No. 13 Illinois.\n\nJamarques Lawrence’s game-winning three just before the buzzer also gave us one of the best moments of the first month and-a-half of the season, and nearly killed Cornhusker play-by-play man Kent Pavelka in the process.\n\n41-year Nebraska basketball play-by-play announcer Kent Pavelka’s (@KentPavelka) call of Jamarques Lawrence’s game winning 3 is GOLD 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/Vofj6HyU1E\n\n— NCAA Buzzer Beaters & Game Winners (@NCAABuzzerBters) December 14, 2025\n\nWe also got this on-court view of the game-winner and resulting celebration via injured Cornhuskers guard Connor Essegian.\n\nTHE CRAZIEST THING I’VE EVER RECORDED. GAME TIME🔥👀 pic.twitter.com/9hbDYNeXms\n\n— Connor Essegian (@CEssegian) December 13, 2025\n\nThe ending was dramatic, but this was no fluke result. For 40 minutes, Nebraska — who had yet to notch a truly head-turning victory or play a true road game before Saturday — was the better team. They led Illinois by as many as 14 points in the first half and by as many as 10 in the second.\n\nLawrence got all the glory, but it was Pryce Sandfort and his career-high 32 points that did the most damage for the Huskers in Champaign. Rienk Mast added 17 points and 7 boards.\n\nWith the combination of their 11-0 start and last season’s championship in the inaugural College Basketball Crown post-season tournament, Nebraska has now won 15 consecutive games. That’s both the longest streak in program history and the longest active streak in men’s college basketball.\n\nInfamously, Nebraska is the only power conference program to have never won a game in the NCAA Tournament. Suddenly, it seems like we might very well be just a few months away from that not-so-fun fact disappearing from the Huskers’ resume forever.",

    "title": "After years of losing myself and my female friendships, I got divorced. Now, I've built a life I love with my best friend.",
    "description": "When I got married, I lost touch with my best friend from college. After my divorce, we went on a life-changing trip and decided to become roommates.",
    "fullText": "\"I don't want to go back,\" said Katie, my best friend of 20 years, from across a café table in Cape Town. A tear slid down her cheek.\n\nWe were two single women traveling 8,000 miles from our respective homes — hers a one-bedroom apartment in New York City, and mine a two-story house in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIt was the last day of a two-week girls' trip and the longest stretch we'd spent together since college.\n\nNow, the reality of returning to a life that would rip us apart again was setting in, and our hearts were breaking simultaneously.\n\nI felt invincible again. So, why did it have to end? Sitting in that sunny café, we decided it didn't.\n\nSaying that Katie and I \"met\" in college feels like a gross understatement. Both in need of a roommate, we were set up by mutual friends who swore we were the perfect fit. They were right.\n\nWe became inseparable from the second we stepped into our tiny dorm room as freshmen, and for the next four years, we were a package deal: Liz and Katie. Katie and Liz.\n\nSomehow, we balanced each other perfectly. I was the short blonde, always a bit too eager to break the rules. Katie was the tall brunette who was more methodical when it came to pushing the limits.\n\nTogether, we proved to be unstoppable, and our adventures were endless.\n\nAfter graduation, we made our way to Manhattan. Eventually, I was living with a boyfriend in a cramped but happy studio apartment, and Katie lived across town.\n\nOn my 28th birthday, my partner surprised me with a proposal. Blindsided yet in love, I said yes.\n\nFor six years, I did what a \"good\" wife does: holidays with my husband, trips with my husband.\n\nI even moved states with him, leaving Katie for a house in a small town. It was his dream, not mine.\n\nSome say marriage is like two becoming one, but for me, I was torn into pieces. Not only did I lose myself prioritizing someone else's needs over my own, but I lost my female friendships.\n\nThrough the years, I canceled countless plans and declined dozens of invitations for girls' trips. As a result, Katie and I became distant. Soon, she had a serious boyfriend I'd never met and new friends who didn't even know my name.\n\nThat's when I began restlessly circling through a cookie-cutter neighborhood I hated, avoiding my home and husband, in what felt like total darkness. Finally, I decided not to return to either.\n\nMy husband and I separated, and I spent the end of my 30s in therapy to learn how to honor my own needs. It was not quick, but eventually, I became a friend to myself — and, in turn, the friend I felt Katie deserved.\n\nStanding on my own two feet in the life I wanted, I called my best friend from six states away to say the words that I'd wanted to for so long: \"How about we take a girls' trip?\"\n\nSix months later, Katie and I flew to South Africa.\n\nWe adventured on safari and up Table Mountain. We sipped wine in vineyards and sat on beautiful beaches.\n\nAfter two weeks together, it felt as if two decades of friendship had been renewed in ways we never could have imagined.\n\nI realized that somewhere along the way, I'd fallen for the idea that success for a woman is finding someone to marry. Katie had too, likening being unmarried to failure.\n\nIt took a divorce for me to realize I already had a partner for life. We could choose to be single and still be supported.\n\nInstead of returning to separate homes, Katie and I hatched a plan to be roommates again. Twenty years after moving into that tiny dorm room, we upgraded to a three-bedroom house big enough to hold all the lessons we'd gathered in the decades between.\n\nLiving together, we don't have to wait to take on adventures anymore. Somehow, it feels like they find us around every corner, whether it's an unexpected connection, a new love interest, or simply a chance to laugh.\n\nThe world is ours again: Liz and Katie. Katie and Liz.",

    "description": "Trump is expanding short-term credential programs through the Workforce Pell grant, while the debate over the value of a college degree continues.",
    "fullText": "The four-year college degree no longer has the same pull it once did — and the Trump administration agrees.\n\nThe Department of Education concluded its negotiations on the Workforce Pell program on December 12, a new initiative included in President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nThe program would extend Pell grants to low-income borrowers in short-term certification programs, with the intention of providing more funding for alternative paths to a four-year college degree or trade school.\n\nNicholas Kent, the department's undersecretary, acknowledged during remarks at the beginning of negotiations that a standard four-year college degree is losing its value.\n\n\"Americans are questioning whether the value of higher education is worth the cost. Polling also shows that students do not believe they are graduating with the specific skills that they need,\" Kent said. He added that skepticism about college degrees has led to students \"showing more interest in pathways that get them into the labor force more quickly and without unnecessary debt.\"\n\nCollege still remains the primary path in the US for postsecondary education, and recent data from the New York Federal Reserve showed that it continues to lead to higher earnings. In addition, proponents argue the value of college extends beyond earnings to social opportunities and exposure to new ideas.\n\nHowever, high student debt loads and a growing number of jobs eliminating degree requirements have sparked a growing interest in short-term credential programs and the trades, which the Trump administration is attempting to boost.\n\nChris Madaio, a senior advisor at the nonprofit The Institute for College Access and Success, told Business Insider that with more Pell grant support extended to short-term programs, it's likely that more schools will offer them and more students will enroll.\n\n\"I think it's all ensuring that students take what's right for them,\" Madaio said. \"These programs should pay off for students, and they should give a good value and use students' limited lifetime Pell grant eligibility for something that's going to work for them and potentially allow them to get a job later down the road.\"\n\nThe Department of Education's Workforce Pell proposal will have a period of public comment before it is set to be implemented in July 2026.\n\nIf the rule is implemented as proposed, eligibility guidelines would vary by state. According to the department, each state will determine what qualifies as a high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand job based on what aligns with the industry needs in that state. For example, a state where agriculture dominates the economy might choose to prioritize short-term programs in that field.\n\nMadaio said that this state variance is by design: \"It's really important that states are taking a close look at what they're approving to ensure that there are jobs in that state and that these are valuable workforce training programs for jobs that are needed in that state.\"\n\nAccountability is key here, Madaio said, and states should ensure that schools are delivering on the value of the programs they offer. Otherwise, students could be left paying off loans they cannot afford — and that's something that the gainful employment rule, which the department is set to negotiate in January, will address.\n\n\"These are really positive developments that show that there's a broad agreement across the political spectrum that we owe it to students to make sure that the programs that they're investing in are going to provide a quality education and that they're going to get something out of it,\" Carolyn Fast, director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider.\n\nSome high schools across the country are working to shift the emphasis away from a four-year college as the only option. Business Insider previously visited a public high school in rural Wyoming, for example, that works to equip students for college, career, or the workforce, giving students the freedom to choose the path that best suits their interests.\n\nOverall, the higher education financing landscape is undergoing significant changes. In addition to the negotiations on Workforce Pell and gainful employment, the Department of Education recently concluded negotiations on a repayment overhaul that condenses the number of existing repayment plans, replacing them with less generous options that could lead to higher payments and shorter timelines to debt relief for student-loan borrowers.\n\nAs the slew of higher education changes takes effect, Madaio said that students should expect to see more advertising for short-term programs that are funded by grants. He recommended that students closely examine the actual costs of a program and its outcomes to avoid predatory behavior by schools.\n\n\"A critical piece is for students to do their homework when deciding on a certificate credential program, and then consider what kind of jobs they can get for that, and are those things that they need the training for?\" Madaio said.",

    "description": "Gottlieb played college basketball at Brown and said she had a teammate whose daughter had to shelter in place in a library basement.",
    "fullText": "USC women’s basketball head coach Lindsay Gottlieb opened her postgame news conference after the No. 16 Trojans’ loss to No. 1 UConn on Saturday night with her thoughts on the mass shooting that took place at Brown University.\n\nProvidence police said Sunday morning that they had detained a person of interest after two people were killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting on campus during finals. The person is in their 30s. The shooting happened in an engineering building on campus as people in the area were told to shelter in place for hours afterward as police looked for the shooter.\n\nGottlieb played basketball at Brown and said that she checked her phone after the game to see many text messages about the shooting. She said she felt she needed to address the shooting because it was more important than basketball and that “we can all be better.”\n\n“It doesn’t need to be this way,” Gottlieb said. “Sending thoughts and prayers to my teammates who have kids there. To the parents that have to worry about their children, I’m just going to end it with that, but just to say we’re the only country that lives this way. The college football cycle has been in the news a million times and are we going to report about this? It’s the guns. We’re the only country that lives this way. Parents should not be worried about their kid — I have a teammate who has a daughter who is in the basement of a library because they don’t know what’s going on there. And she’s flying there tomorrow.\"\n\nPolice said the shooter had a handgun and fired more than 40 rounds during the incident. The mayor of Providence, Brett Smiley, said that the building’s outside doors were unlocked but that access to the classrooms where exams were taking place required a badge.\n\nGottlieb has been USC’s coach since 2021 after she spent two seasons as an assistant for the Cleveland Cavaliers following her time as Cal’s head coach. She played at Brown from 1995-99 and immediately got into coaching after her collegiate playing career was over.\n\nUSC lost 79-51 at home to UConn on Saturday night as the Trojans play the season without injured star JuJu Watkins. She injured her knee in the 2025 NCAA tournament before USC fell to UConn in the Elite Eight a season ago. Watkins, who suffered a torn ACL, will miss the entire 2025-26 season.",

    "fullText": "As Fernando Mendoza put the finishing touches on a Heisman Trophy-winning season, he signed an NIL deal with adidas. Shortly after he won college football’s highest honor, the brand paid tribute.\n\nAdidas released a video honoring Mendoza after he won the Heisman on Saturday night. The brand paid homage to his viral quote following the Big Ten Championship when the IU quarterback told FOX Sports’ Jenny Taft, “The Hoosiers are flippin’ champs.”\n\nThroughout the year, Mendoza not only became one of the biggest stars on the field, but one of the top names in the sport. He has a $2.6 million On3 NIL Valuation as Indiana soon prepares for the College Football Playoff as the No. 1 seed.\n\n@IndianaFootballpic.twitter.com/xafU0DhsLC\n\n— adidas US Football (@adidasFballUS) December 14, 2025\n\nJust before IU took on Ohio State in Indianapolis, Mendoza announced his high-profile NIL deal with adidas. He is the latest college football star to partner with the Three Stripes, joining Ohio State receiver Jeremiah Smith and Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola, among others.\n\n“Excited to share that I’ve accepted an opportunity to join adidas!” Mendoza wrote in a LinkedIn post. “I’m very grateful for everyone who has supported me along the way and excited to bring my passion for sport, leadership, and work ethic to the Three Stripes. Let’s get to work.”\n\nMendoza led the nation with 33 touchdown passes this year while completing 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards, to just six interceptions. Additionally, his $2.6 million On3 NIL Valuation ranks No. 5 in college football and No. 7 in the On3 NIL 100, the first of its kind and defacto NIL ranking of the top 100 high school and college athletes ranked by their On3 NIL Valuation.\n\nFernando Mendoza beat out Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia for the award, garnering 643 first-place votes and 2,362 points. Pavia got 189 first-place votes and 1,435 points. It’s the latest chapter in a special season for the former Cal star, who helped lead Indiana to its first outright Big Ten title since 1945.\n\nAfter the announcement, Mendoza delivered a passionate speech. As he wrapped, he had a message for young athletes who think they’re not getting enough attention or are ranked high enough.\n\n“The truth is, you don’t need the most stars, hype or rankings,” Mendoza said. “You just need discipline, heart and people who believe in you. And you need to believe in your own abilities. I hope this moment shows you that chasing your dreams are worth it, no matter how big or impossible they seem.”",

    "description": "Our Memphis vs. Louisville predictions expect the Tigers to cover on Saturday.",
    "fullText": "The No. 11-ranked Louisville Cardinals host the Memphis Tigers in college basketball action on Saturday.\n\nThe Cardinals are an offensive powerhouse and sit as 15.5-point favorites, but my Memphis vs. Louisville predictions think the spread is a tad too wide.\n\nSee why with my college basketball picks for this non-conference clash on December 13.\n\nMemphis vs Louisville best bet: Memphis +15.5 (-105)\n\nThe Louisville Cardinals entered this season with national title aspirations and have rolled to an 8-1 record. After losing their first game of the season at No. 17 Arkansas last week, they bounced back with an 87-78 win against Indiana.\n\nThe Cardinals launch threes at the highest rate in the nation and knock them down at a 36% clip. They're also highly efficient inside the arc and sit in the Top 50 in turnover rate. That said, their stock is at a sell-high point making this line a tad too wide.\n\nThe Memphis Tigers got off to a poor start this season, losing four of their first five games. However, they've gone 7-1 against the spread this season and are trending in the right direction. They're now on a three-game win streak and are fresh off a 78-71 win against Baylor.\n\nFormer five-star recruit Aaron Bradshaw had averaged just 10.8 minutes per game through his first contests with his new school. However, the center has logged 15.5 points in 21.0 minutes per game over his last two contests.\n\nMeanwhile, Louisville's five-star guard Mikel Brown has struggled with his shot after a great start to his college career. The freshman is shooting just 30.8% from the field and 19.5% from the arc over his last five games.\n\nWhen the Tigers faced Purdue (then the No. 1 team in the country) in Nassau three weeks ago, they were 14.5-point underdogs. They were neck-and-neck until the five minutes before the Boilermakers pulled away for a nine-point win.\n\nExpect the Tigers to keep things within a big number against a highly-ranked opponent again.\n\nWhile I'm betting on Memphis to cover this big spread, I still think Louisville is the far better team and will get the win at home.\n\nIf the Tigers want to cover this spread, they need to make sure Louisville doesn't go ballistic from deep. Brown has knocked down fewer than 2.5 threes in four of his last five games.\n\nThe Cardinals have been elite on offense but aren't as good on the other end of the floor. That combined with their blazing-fast pace can lead to inflated offensive numbers for their opponents.\n\nThat's good news for Memphis point guard Dug McDaniel who has dropped more than 5.5 dimes in six of eight games this season.\n\nLouisville center Sananda Fru has grabbed fewer than 7.5 boards in seven of his last eight games.\n\nSpread: Memphis +15.5 (-105) | Louisville -15.5 (-115)\n\nMoneyline: Memphis +950 | Louisville -1700\n\nOver/Under: Over 160.5 | Under 160.5\n\nThe Tigers are 7-1 ATS this season.

    "description": "I told my kids that they can be successful without a college degree, but they decided to attend college anyway. I'm still so proud of them.",
    "fullText": "I was surprised when my daughter told me she wanted not only to attend college but also to pursue medical school. She even planned out her prerequisite classes, residency, and potential debt.\n\nIn our house, we rarely talked about college because I never went. My husband also only did a few semesters at community college.\n\nHigher education was never a requirement in our house. I never expected my daughters to enroll and take on student loan debt because I found a path to entrepreneurship without all of that.\n\nAnd yet, both of my daughters want to go to college, and I respect their decision.\n\nMy mom has been a salon owner in Baltimore for over 35 years. The salon was my after-school program, my social circle, and my introduction to business. I learned early that work is more than a paycheck. It is the foundation for the kind of life you want to live.\n\nMy mom didn't talk about freedom in a motivational sense. She lived it. She set her own schedule and ran the business in a way that made sense for her. Watching that shaped me more than any degree ever could.\n\nWhen I graduated from high school and had my first child at 18, I didn't even consider college — not because I felt incapable. I simply didn't believe a traditional route was required to build the life that I envisioned for myself.\n\nMy mom taught me how to work hard, how to serve people well, and how to think independently. I built my early adulthood on those values and eventually became an entrepreneur myself, returning to my mother's salon as a co-owner. Everything I learned about resilience, money, and adaptability came from living real life, not writing dissertations about it in a lecture hall.\n\nThe lessons my daughters absorbed from me were not about degrees. The lessons were more about self-discipline and financial awareness. I taught them how to budget. I taught them how to track their spending. I taught them why credit matters and how debt can limit your life before adulthood even begins.\n\nWhen my oldest turned 16 and got her first job, she learned to manage money the same way I did. She made mistakes, then corrected them. She saved. She budgeted. She paid attention. Now she supports herself as a server while attending college using financial aid and cash she earns. She files her own taxes. She pays her own bills. She manages tuition payment plans with intention instead of fear.\n\nWatching her handle her life this way reminds me that independence is a muscle; if you teach your kids how to use it, they grow strong without you having to push.\n\nMy youngest, now a high school senior, is also preparing for college. She has a different personality but the same drive. She does her research. She looks up scholarships. She treats her future like something she is shaping, rather than something that is happening to her. I see two young women who understand the financial reality of higher education but aren't intimidated by it.\n\nThere is immense pride in the fact that my daughters are finding their own way in life, but there is also a quiet ache. You spend years pouring into your children. Then, suddenly, you are watching them become adults who no longer want to live the life you envisioned for them.\n\nAvoiding college debt gave me a certain kind of freedom. Teaching my daughters about money and independence gave them the freedom to make choices. Seeing them use those choices to stretch beyond my experiences feels like the true return on everything I poured into them.\n\nThe goal was never to avoid college. It was about creating a foundation strong enough for them to choose their own direction. Watching them do that is the greatest return on investment I could ever receive.",

    "description": "This Playoff is full of talented players.",
    "fullText": "This is only the second season of the 12-team College Football Playoff, but this bracket is among the weirder in the playoff era. Two Group of Five teams? One Group of Five team seemed unfathomable just a few years ago. Now, two are in the playoffs.\n\nThe top four teams are seemingly on another tier in this year’s postseason, but there are some intriguing teams seeded 5-12. Let’s take a look at each team in the playoffs and one player to watch on each team.\n\nWide Receiver, Elijah Sarratt: Stats: 51 receptions, 687 yards, 12 touchdowns\n\nSarratt is a scary good, athletic receiver. He caught what proved to be the game-winning touchdown in the Big Ten Championship in the third quarter. Opposing secondaries are going to have to have a good game plan to prevent him from taking over the game.\n\nDefensive End, Caden Curry: Stats: 11 sacks, 16.5 tackles for loss, 6 quarterback hurries, 1 blocked kick\n\nCurry played with his hair on fire in the Big Ten Championship. That’s nothing new, though. He’s been playing that way all season. With his pass-rushing prowess, Curry can wreck any opposing offensive game plan.\n\nQuarterback, Gunner Stockton: Stats: 70.7 completion percentage, 2,691 yards, 23 touchdowns, 5 interceptions\n\nStockton has settled in nicely after a subpar performance in relief of Carson Beck in the SEC Championship and Playoff Quarterfinals matchup. Opposing defenses can’t take him lightly.\n\nLinebacker, Jacob Rodriguez: Stats: 117 tackles, 11 tackles for loss, 4 interceptions, 7 forced fumbles, 2 fumbles recovered\n\nThere may be no defensive player in college football more impactful than Jacob Rodriguez. The stats speak for themselves. Should Ohio State play the Red Raiders in the National Championship, it will be fascinating to see how the Buckeyes’ offense game plans for Rodriguez.\n\nQuarterback, Dante Moore: Stats: 72.5 completion percentage, 2,733 yards, 24 touchdowns, 6 interceptions\n\nMoore is having a really good season. It will be interesting to see how he will perform on the Playoff stage.\n\nQuarterback, Trinidad Chambliss: Stats: 65.5 completion percentage, 3,016 yards, 18 touchdowns, 3 interceptions; 118 rushes, 470 rushing yards, 6 rushing touchdowns\n\nChambliss started the season as Ole Miss’s backup, but he has taken off as the starter this season and has flourished. It will be interesting to see if he will be distracted by the drama surrounding Lane Kiffin’s departure going into the Playoff.\n\nQuarterback, Marcell Reed: Stats: 61.8 completion percentage, 2,932 yards, 25 touchdowns, 10 interceptions; 89 rushes, 466 rushing yards, 6 rushing touchdowns\n\nIf the Aggies play the Buckeyes in the Quarterfinals at the Cotton Bowl Classic, it will be fascinating to see how the Buckeyes’ defense does against Reed’s dual-threat abilities.\n\nDefensive Lineman, Taylor Wein: Stats: 6 sacks, 14 tackles for loss, 6 quarterback hurries\n\nThe Sooners’ defense is what drives this team. Wein is the engine of it up front. How far the Sooners go will be contingent on his play.\n\nQuarterback, Ty Simpson: Stats: 64.3 completion percentage, 3,268 yards, 26 touchdowns, 5 interceptions\n\nSimpson is a really good quarterback, but he’s coming into the playoffs on a bit of a cold streak. He struggled in the Iron Bowl and the SEC Championship, but Simpson is still a dangerous quarterback who must be taken seriously.\n\nWide Receiver, Malachi Toney: Stats: 84 receptions, 970 yards, 7 touchdowns\n\nToney is a physical beast at wide receiver. He has 25 receptions for 272 yards and two touchdowns in the Hurricanes’ last two games. Should the Buckeyes play the Hurricanes in the Quarterfinals, their secondary could be tested by Toney’s athletic and prolific pass-catching.\n\nOutside Linebacker, Harvey Dyson: Stats: 7 sacks, 10.5 tackles for loss\n\nIf the Green Wave is going to beat Ole Miss, it’s going to start at the line of scrimmage. Dyson is the leader of the Green Wave’s defense.\n\nRunning Back, Wayne Knight: Stats: 190 rushes, 1,263 yards, 9 touchdowns; 37 receptions, 379 receiving yards\n\nKnight is having a really good season in what’s been a dream season for the Dukes. Running games travel, and James Madison will need Knight to have a big day to have a chance at pulling a major upset in Eugene against the Ducks.",

    "fullText": "The first time Fernando Mendoza put his hands on a Heisman Trophy, he did it as a whim on a recruiting trip to Yale.\n\nOn Saturday, he’ll be on stage for the real deal.\n\nMendoza enters having won the Associated Press Player of the Year Award and as the the favorite to win college football’s most prestigious individual award. He would be the first winner from Indiana University and the third with Hispanic roots — titles not lost on the once lightly recruited Miami native who started contemplating this storybook ending a few months ago.\n\n“At the beginning of the year, I saw the list of the top-10 Heisman contenders and evidently (my name) wasn’t there,” he said. “I was like, ‘Wow, I want to make a goal for myself.’ I prayed about, like, if I could make it to the ceremony, how cool that would be. Now that it’s come to fruition, I’m able to share that moment with people who appreciate it. It’s such a cool moment.”\n\nFor Mendoza, his first and likely only season in Bloomington has been filled with memories.\n\nAs fans watched him throw winning touchdown passes late in games against Iowa, Oregon and Penn State what he did behind the scenes — forcing bonds with new teammates, embracing family time and savoring all those special celebrations — helped deliver program-changing victories like a 13-10 victory over No. 1 Ohio State that gave Indiana its first Big Ten title since 1967, a 13-0 mark and the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff.\n\nAlong the way, Mendoza cherished his time studying film with his younger brother, Alberto, meeting with coaches and hearing students serenade him with chants of “HeisMendoza.”\n\nThe funny thing is Fernando Mendoza never sought the spotlight. He just wanted to win.\n\n“He’s just the ultimate professional and a wonderful teammate,” starting center Pat Coogan said. “He prepares like no one I’ve ever seen. He works his butt off like no one I’ve ever seen. He’s just an awesome locker room guy on top of that.”\n\nWhen Mendoza entered the transfer portal last winter, he could have gone essentially anywhere. He chose Indiana because he knew coach Curt Cignetti would push him hard to improve.\n\nMendoza knew of Cignetti’s reputation for developing quarterbacks.\n\nAt North Carolina State, Cignetti worked with Pro Football Hall of Fame semifinalist Philip Rivers and helped recruit Super Bowl champ Russell Wilson. Then as Cignetti guided the most successful transition from the Football Championship Subdivision to the Football Bowl Subdivision he helped three quarterbacks win conference player of the year awards in five seasons.\n\nLast year, his first at Indiana, Cignetti brought in 2023 Mid-American Conference Player of the Year Kurtis Rourke, who led the Hoosiers to a school record 11 victories and their first playoff bid while earning second-team all-Big Ten honors. Rourke finished ninth in the Heisman voting.\n\nWhen Cignetti did his homework on Mendoza, he saw something different from the late-bloomer.\n\n“Being the film junkie I am, and making all the different cutups, occasionally I’d see plays from Fernando at Cal,” Cignetti said. “When he went in the portal, obviously we watched a lot of game tape on him and just really liked his stuff — the quick release, the arm, the mobility. He’s a great person. He really prepares. He’s really smart, and he’s developed quite a bit since he’s been here.”\n\nMendoza’s mobility might not have been as evident in 2024 when he was sacked 41 times.\n\nBut Cignetti embraced taking a two-year starter from a Power Four school with a rich tradition of producing quarterbacks. He was impressed by Mendoza’s crafty work ethic, selfless leadership style and his inspirational journey from grandson of Cuban immigrants to one of America’s best college quarterbacks all while watching his mother battle multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe adversity has helped Mendoza maintain a positive approach with the kind of real-life perspective rarely found in a 22-year-old with the spotlight shining so brightly on him.\n\n“I’ve been lucky enough to have such a great team that I’ve always been in a good position to win games,” Mendoza said. “That’s what’s helped elevate me to the position I’ll be in Saturday night.”\n\nIt didn’t take Mendoza long to win the hearts of Hoosiers fans, who have waited decades to cheer a legitimate Heisman contender.\n\nThe last time was 2001 when quarterback Antwaan Randle El finished sixth in the voting. The best finish by an Indiana player was 1989 when running back Anthony Thompson finished second.\n\nBut Mendoza didn’t impress immediately. His breakout game came in Week 4, a rout over then-No. 8 Illinois when he threw five TD passes for the second straight week. Suddenly, to his surprise, friends began touting him as a Heisman contender.\n\nOne week later, at Iowa, he beat a blitz to find Elijah Sarratt for a 49-yard touchdown with 88 seconds to go. But the play that showed his teammates what Mendoza was all about came when he took a big hit on a run out of bounds that ignited a sideline shoving match.\n\n“I told him we had his back. I said ‘Go out there and just sling it, we have all the confidence in the world in you,’” linebacker Aiden Fisher said. “That dude’s got some confidence, too. He’s got some swagger. He looked at me and said, ‘I got us. don’t even worry about it.’”\n\nHe showed his resilience again at No. 3 Oregon with a tiebreaking 8-yard TD pass to Sarratt after throwing the Pick-6 that tied the score at 20. He did it again in the final minute at Penn State and again in the third quarter against the Buckeyes, putting him here on the cusp of hoisting his own Heisman Trophy.\n\n“The (other finalists) are fantastic players. I think everybody, when you’re a finalist, you’ve got to prepare a speech because anything could happen,” Mendoza said before discussing the Heisman being a goal. “I thought of it, but it was a little bit more of a dream and a long-range goal or a goal you reach a little farther than you think you could reach.”\n\nIt could be right in his hands Saturday night.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee executed Harold Wayne Nichols by lethal injection Thursday in Nashville for the 1988 rape and murder of Karen Pulley, a 20-year-old student at Chattanooga State Community College.\n\nNichols, 64, had confessed to killing Pulley as well as raping several other women in the Chattanooga area. Although he expressed remorse at trial, he admitted he would have continued his violent behavior had he not been arrested. He was sentenced to death in 1990.\n\n“To the people I've harmed, I'm sorry,” Nichols said in his final statement. Before Nichols died, a spiritual adviser prayed over him in the execution chamber and the two recited together the 23rd Psalm and the Lord's Prayer. At several points, they teared up and their voices became strained. After the final “Amen,” the adviser, J.R. Davis, continued talking quietly, with Nichols nodding along.\n\n“Go in peace, my friend. I love you,” Davis told Nichols.\n\nNichols was strapped to a gurney with a sheet pulled up to just above his waist and a long tube running from an adjoining room to an IV inserted on the inside of his elbow. There was a spot of blood near the injection site. At one point he took a very heavy breath and his whole torso rose up. He then took a series of short, huffing breaths that witnesses said sounded like snorting or snoring. Nichols’ face turned red and he groaned. His breathing then appeared to slow, then stop, and his face became purple before he was pronounced dead.\n\nNichols' sister, Deborah Perry, watched the execution from a witness chamber and cried quietly but did not speak.\n\nNichols’ attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have his sentence commuted to life in prison, citing the fact that he took responsibility for his crimes and pleaded guilty. His clemency petition stated “he would be the first person to be executed for a crime he pleaded guilty to since Tennessee re-enacted the death penalty in 1978.”\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to issue a stay of the execution on Thursday.\n\nPulley's sister, Lisette Monroe, had wanted to be present for the execution but became too overwhelmed, her husband and Pulley's brother-in-law, Jeff Monroe, told media afterwards. He read a statement that said the family “was destroyed by evil” the night Pulley was killed.\n\n“Taking a life is serious, and we take no pleasure in it,” he said. “However, the victims, and there were many, were carefully stalked and attacked. The crimes, and there were many, were deliberate, violent, and horrific.”\n\nIn a recent interview, Lisette Monroe, said the wait for Nichols' execution has been “37 years of hell.” She described her sister as “gentle, sweet and innocent,” and said she hopes that after the execution she'll be able to focus on the happy memories of Pulley instead of her murder.\n\nPulley, who was 20 when she was killed, had just finished Bible college and was attending school in Chattanooga to become a paralegal, Jeff Monroe said.\n\n“Karen was bubbly, happy, selfless, and looking forward to the life before her,” he said.\n\nNichols' attorney, Debbie Drew, also spoke after the execution, saying her client had turned his life over to God after speaking to Pulley's mother decades ago, shortly after he was sentenced. His execution “sent the message that no one can rise beyond the crimes they committed decades earlier and that redemption deserves no mercy,” she said.\n\nDavis said after the execution that he had known Nichols for a decade as part of a prison men's group and believes that Nichols' remorse and spiritual transformation were genuine. Davis said Nichols committed “horrible crimes. But killing to teach people not to kill just doesn't make sense.”\n\nNichols had seen two previous execution dates come and go. The state earlier planned to execute him in August 2020, but Nichols was given a reprieve due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMany states have had difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs as anti-death penalty activists have put pressure on drug companies and other suppliers. Between the shortages and legal challenges over botched executions, some states have moved to alternative methods of execution including a firing squad in South Carolina and nitrogen gas in Alabama.\n\nIncluding Nichols, a total of 46 men have died by court-ordered execution this year in the U.S.\n\nCorrects that Pulley was a student at Chattanooga State Community College.\n\nReporter Adrian Sainz contributed from Memphis, Tennessee.",

    "description": "The NCAA Transfer Portal doesn’t officially open for another three weeks, but that hasn’t stopped hundreds of players from announcing their intentions to enter.

    "fullText": "The NCAA Transfer Portal doesn’t officially open for another three weeks, but that hasn’t stopped hundreds of players from announcing their intentions to enter.\n\nOfficially, players can be entered into the portal beginning January 2, and will have a two-week window until January 15 to get in. For players who are playing in the College Football Playoff beyond those dates, they’ll have a five-day window after their team’s final game to get in as well.\n\nMore than 300 players have already expressed their plans to enter the portal, and On3’s rankings team has graded the entrants as of Dec. 11. Last year, more than 4,900 FBS players — including walk-ons — entered their name in the portal between the two windows.\n\nNow with only one window, we could see that number dwindle some, or it could be a mad dash to get into college football’s version of free agency. Here are the top 10 players currently expected to enter next month:\n\nLeavitt entered the 2025 season as a darkhorse Heisman candidate after a breakout campaign as a redshirt freshman, where he completed nearly 62 percent of his passes for 2,885 yards and 24 touchdowns to just six interceptions. He was riddled by injuries though, missing the team’s final five regular-season games. Last month, On3’s Steve Wiltfong and Pete Nakos reported Leavitt was being shopped around to other programs by his representatives, and he didn’t attend the team’s end-of-season banquet over the weekend.\n\nIn spite of very up-and-down quarterback play during his two seasons with the Spartans, Marsh established himself as one of the Big Ten’s premier receivers. In his debut campaign, Marsh tallied 41 catches for 649 yards and three touchdowns. His receiving yards and receptions stand as the most by a true freshman in school history. This year, he hauled in 59 catches, totaling 662 yards and six touchdowns. With two years of eligibility left, he’ll be one of the most sought-after players in the portal.\n\nCarter’s winding career in Knoxville looks to officially be over after two seasons. An early commit during his senior year to the Vols, Carter flirted with other programs ahead of Signing Day in 2023, but did officially ink with Tennessee. He quickly made his presence felt as a freshman, totaling 38 tackles, three tackles for loss and an interception. But issues began to pop up last offseason, and he was nearly dismissed from the team prior to fall camp. He appeared in nine games as a sophomore in a significantly reduced role, and will be looking for a fresh start elsewhere.\n\nA late addition to Notre Dame’s 2023 class, Minchey sat behind Sam Hartman and Riley Leonard his first two seasons with the program. This spring and into the fall, he battled with redshirt freshman CJ Carr for the starting job, with Carr ultimately getting the nod. During his three years in South Bend, Minchey completed 23 of 29 passes for 212 yards and will be one of the more intriguing quarterback options in the portal come January.\n\nDespite coming from the MAC, Trick is the highest-rated pass-rusher currently in the portal. Across his last two seasons, he has appeared in 27 games for the RedHawks, totaling 96 tackles, 18 tackles for loss and 13 sacks. The 6-foot-4, 245-pounder has also been a turnover machine with three forced fumbles and was named first-team All-MAC this year.\n\nA native of Huntington Beach (Calif.), Brown burst onto the scene this fall after missing most of his career due to injury. Fully healthy this season, he caught 71 passes for 1,085 yards and 11 touchdowns while averaging better than 108 yards per contest. The 6-foot, 185-pounder is another who will be highly coveted as a plug-and-play wideout.\n\nDavis joined the Tigers late in the 2025 cycle, flipping from SEC rival Kentucky to Missouri just days before National Signing Day. Rivals ranked him as the country’s No. 7 running back in the class, and he showed why in small spurts as a true freshman. While playing behind All-American Ahmad Hardy and standout Jamal Roberts, he rushed 34 times for 200 yards and a pair of touchdowns. The Cleveland product will have all four years of eligibility remaining after only playing in three games.\n\nDel Grande, a native of Pennsylvania, developed into a three-year starter at left tackle and earned a preseason All-Sun Belt selection in 2025. As a sophomore, in 2024, he helped anchor a unit that led the Sun Belt in fewest sacks allowed (15), a mark which ranked tied for 17th in the NCAA FBS.\n\nDickens started his career at Georgia Tech, but transferred to play for the Flames ahead of last season. In his lone year in Lynchburg, he rushed for 1,339 yards and 16 touchdowns on just 229 carries, averaging 5.8 yards per attempt. His 17 total scores ranked No. 4 nationally, while his rushing average (121.9 YPG) was third-best in the country. The second-team All-CUSA has two years of eligibility left.\n\nA three-year starter at left tackle for the Huskies, Malcore led a unit that paved the way for one of the best rushing offenses in the country in 2024 and 2025. In total, he started 32 games during his time at NIU and projects as a plug-and-play tackle for teams seeking experience along the offensive line this fall.\n\n+ Perry Thompson (No. 13) – The Auburn wide receiver showed up on The Plains with high hopes, but struggled to carve out a significant role behind Eric Singleton, Cam Coleman and Malcolm Simmons. Thompson hauled in 17 passes for 154 yards this season and will have two years of eligibility remaining.\n\n+ CJ Baxter Jr. (No. 14) – A former five-star, Baxter never quite rebounded from the ACL injury he suffered at the beginning of his sophomore season 2024. As a true freshman the year prior, he accounted for 815 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns, but this year he carried just 54 times for 196 yards. The Florida native will be one to watch for a number of Sunshine State programs.\n\n+ Dylan Edwards (No. 15) – Edwards’ journey continues after playing at both Kansas State and Colorado during his first three seasons. An all-purpose weapon, he accounted for nearly 700 yards and seven touchdowns as a sopho\n\n+ Jerrick Gibson (No. 20) – Another highly touted back coming from the Longhorns, Gibson spent two seasons in Austin where he struggled to break through on the depth chart. He played in all 15 games as a freshman after Baxter’s injury, totaling 402 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns. But he only played in four games as a sophomore, rushing for 152 yards before leaving the program in October to preserve his redshirt.\n\n+ Derek Williams (No. 27) – The third notable Texas entrant on the list, Williams appeared in 29 games across his three years on the Forty Acres, registering 76 tackles, two tackles for loss and an interception. He had a breakout season as a true freshman in 2023 with 42 tackles, but suffered a season-ending injury the following year and only appeared in four games in 2024.\n\nHe returned in 2025, but primarily served as a backup to senior Michael Taaffe, a second-team All-American last season.",

    "description": "Trivago CEO Johannes Thomas shares how he rose from intern to chief executive without finishing college, driven by curiosity and learning.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Johannes Thomas, CEO of Trivago. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2011, I took a six-month internship at Trivago. I was in my third year of university, nearing completion of a four-year degree in economics and tourism. I had started a digital travel company on the side, and I planned to learn from the internship and apply the new skills to my own company.\n\nThe internship came with a steep learning curve. Back then, the company had about 50 employees, many of whom were interns. I had a lot of responsibility and room to grow. Being at Trivago felt like playing in a crazy sandbox where I could try anything.\n\nI never had the expectation of following a traditional career path. My father was an entrepreneur who ran a tour company in Germany. I considered joining the family business, but I was interested in the digital side of tourism. Coming from an entrepreneurial family, I was taught to follow my curiosity.\n\nStill, my mother wasn't thrilled when I dropped out of school. She argued that I only had one more year, and I should just finish. I have no regrets about not getting my degree, however. I rarely think about it these days.\n\nMy internship at Trivago was focused on online marketing in the UK. At the time, Google's performance marketing was the new frontier. You couldn't learn about it at school, because once a book was published, its information was outdated.\n\nYou had to learn by trying things out, which gave young people like me a real advantage. Since I was able to understand performance marketing, I was hired to handle global search engine marketing. I stayed in that role for three years before moving on to strategic projects.\n\nI've changed jobs at Trivago every two to three years. I try to make myself obsolete within a team, and always move on to something that's a new learning experience. Since my internship, I've held six different positions.\n\nThe pandemic, which hit when I was chief revenue officer, was a near-death experience for Trivago. We lost 95% of our revenue within a matter of weeks. No one knew when it would come back.\n\nThat's when I stepped away from the company for the first time. I formed a startup with other Trivago folks. I'm still involved with that as an investor, but in 2023 I returned to Trivago as CEO.\n\nWhen I came back, the team was very demoralized. As the leader, I needed to take decisive actions to stabilize the company and create success. Luckily, travel came back stronger than ever. Today, Trivago has about 600 employees (down from about 1,500 before the pandemic), but we're able to make a great impact due to technology like AI.\n\nThree of the four leaders of Trivago started as interns, so my experience is not unique. We aim to be a company where people can grow long-term.\n\nTrivago still has a strong internship program: in fact, I've about doubled the number of interns since 2023. It's great for recruiting. When someone has a six-month internship, you really get to see whether they're going to contribute to your team.\n\nWhen I hire, I always ask people about their portfolio before I ask about their degree. A degree is important for getting into the workforce, but it becomes less important when you're able to demonstrate the real impact you've had. I've been successful because I take initiative and execute ideas. That's more important than any degree.",

    "description": "I once dismissed reality shows like 'RHOSLC,' but now I tune in happily. Watching gives me a way to talk about important issues with my 22-year-old.",
    "fullText": "As a former English literature major, I really thought I was above reality TV.\n\nI don't watch a lot of content, and when I do, I'm more of a \"Game of Thrones\" person than a \"Real Housewives\" person. I love analyzing themes, motives, and emotional arcs, and I assumed the Bravo franchise had nothing to offer but mindless drama.\n\nFor years, I had avoided the shows and would usually leave the room when my teenage daughter turned them on. Today, things have changed. I now happily watch the drama, appreciative of how my daughter and I have connected and found a way to talk about important topics through what many consider to be a guilty-pleasure show.\n\nMy daughter went off to college, and got busier, more independent, and harder to read from a distance. I missed her like crazy and often felt like I had fewer and fewer windows into the woman she was becoming.\n\nSo when she suggested I watch an episode of \"The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,\" a show I'd long viewed as the epitome of trash TV, I surprised us both by reconsidering.\n\nEven though we were two states away from each other, while my daughter is away at school, I decided to watch an episode on my own. I didn't expect to like it, but I love my daughter more than I dislike reality TV, so I gave it a try.\n\nWhen I sat down for my first episode, I expected tacky glam, tired stereotypes, and fake conflict, and I got all of that. But I also saw a lot more, including women wrestling with shame and accountability, resisting unrealistic expectations, confronting faith transitions, and reinventing themselves after major midlife upheavals.\n\nTo my surprise, I was hooked, especially when I started talking through the storylines with my daughter.\n\nI was shocked at how fast the show became our shared language. We started out laughing at the bad behavior and wild fashion, but soon the conversations deepened, and we found ourselves discussing body image, mental health, and relationships, especially women's friendships. In fact, we've talked \n\nWatching \"RHOSLC\" has opened a new connection between my daughter and me at a stage of parenting when I wasn't sure how to reach her. Through our weekly Housewives debriefs, I've learned so much about her views on loyalty, identity, ambition, faith, and belonging.\n\nShe notices patterns in relationships that took me decades to understand. Her emotional intelligence, especially her ability to call out toxicity and name her boundaries, reassures me that she's not just okay, she's thriving.\n\nAnd in turn, I've been able to share my own insights, not in my lecturing \"mom voice,\" but as another woman navigating friendships, reinvention, and societal pressures. Watching the show has created a neutral space where we can meet as equals, rather than parent and child.\n\nI'm still not a fan of how the show perpetuates negative stereotypes, promotes conspicuous consumption, and glamorizes toxic relationships for entertainment value. But I appreciate how the show gives us a way to talk openly about those issues. Watching women in midlife grapple with everything from body image to an empty nest provides young women with a wider, more complex picture of adulthood than they might find elsewhere.\n\nThis experience has changed how I think about connecting with my adult children. Sometimes the best bridge isn't a carefully crafted heart-to-heart, it's the willingness to try new things and meet them where they are. And I'm reminded that I would do anything for my kids. Even watch reality TV.",

    "description": "Former Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray predicts how the College Football Playoff will go and the national champion.",
    "fullText": "Former Georgia Bulldog and college football analyst Aaron Murray released his prediction on the College Football Playoff. He went on his social media account to release the prediction, and he went with his former team, picking the Georgia Bulldogs to win the national championship.\n\nHe pointed out all the winners of each playoff game, so Georgia would defeat the No. 6 Ole Miss Rebels, the No. 10 Miami Hurricanes, and the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers to win the national championship. Another wrinkle in his Georgia pride is he predicts former Georgia quarterback Carson Beck to go far in the playoff, with his Miami Hurricanes beating No. 7 Texas A&M and No. 2 Ohio State on their way to the semifinals. Beck would face his former team in that game if Murray's prediction comes true.\n\nMurray might be showing some bias to his former team, but the Bulldogs should be considered a championship-caliber team. ESPN's Football Power Index structure has the Bulldogs in the second-tier of championship contending teams, behind Indiana and Ohio State.\n\nHowever, Georgia has one of the strongest resumes in the playoff, placing second behind just Indiana in strength of record, a stat that quantifies how good a team is based on if an average Top 25 team would have that team's record or better, given that team's schedule.\n\nBias aside, Aaron Murray's prediction illustrates how easy of a path Georgia has to the national championship. In the Sugar Bowl, the Bulldogs get to play either Ole Miss, a team that they've already beaten, or Tulane, a Group of Five opponent. In the semifinal, they play either Ohio State, who has an 0-2 record vs. Georgia, Texas A&M, who beat just one opponent currently in the top 25 (Notre Dame), or Miami, who has their former quarterback.\n\nGonna be one heck of a playoff but only 1 team can win it all\n\nAnd that team will be THE GEORGIA BULLDAWGS pic.twitter.com/F5YvKyHxxr\n\n— Aaron Murray (@aaronmurray11) December 9, 2025\n\nFollow UGA Wire on Instagram or Threads for more Georgia football coverage!\n\nThis article originally appeared on UGA Wire: Aaron Murray predicts CFP, winner of national championship",

    "description": "Fei-Fei Li, founder of the AI startup World Labs, says she now favors fast learners who embrace AI tools over candidates with traditional degrees.",
    "fullText": "Don't count on a college degree to land your dream job in Silicon Valley.\n\nIncreasingly, founders and tech companies are judging talent by how quickly someone can learn, adapt, and build — not on how long they spent in a lecture hall — reshaping traditional pathways into the workforce.\n\nFei-Fei Li, the Stanford computer science professor widely known as the \"Godmother of AI,\" is one example of this.\n\nIn an interview on \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" this week, she spoke about the value of a degree when it comes to hiring for her AI startup, World Labs.\n\n\"When we interview a software engineer, I personally feel the degree they have matters less to us now,\" Li said.\n\n\"Now, it's more about what have you learned, what tools do you use, how quickly can you superpower yourself in using these tools — and a lot of these are AI tools,\" she said. \"What's your mindset toward using these tools matter more to me.\"\n\nHer hiring bar has become even clearer: she won't hire software engineers who resist AI.\n\n\"At this point in 2025 — hiring at World Labs — I would not hire any software engineer who does not embrace AI collaborative software tools,\" Li said.\n\nIt's not about automating humans out of the equation, she added — it's about identifying people who can grow as fast as the technology around them.\n\n\"If you're able to use these tools, you're able to learn. You can superpower yourself better,\" she said.\n\nLi's stance is part of a broader shift playing out across Silicon Valley, where more founders and even major tech firms are openly questioning the value of higher education.\n\nPalantir's CEO, Alex Karp, has openly challenged the value of a college education, urging young entrepreneurs to skip the lecture hall and learn by doing instead — a view echoed by LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, who has said that adaptability and AI fluency now matter far more than the \"fanciest degrees.\"\n\n\"AI makes skill sets based on years of education irrelevant,\" Dan Rhoton, CEO of Hopeworks, told Business Insider. Hopeworks is a tech-training nonprofit that prepares underrepresented talent for AI-enabled jobs.\n\nAfter 13 years of preparing unemployed young adults ages 17 to 26 in Camden, New Jersey, and Philadelphia for tech careers, Rhoton said he has watched firsthand how AI is upending the value of a college degree.\n\n\"We're seeing more and more employers coming to us, saying, 'We used to require a bachelor's degree in this, but we don't understand why.'\"\n\nInstead, he said, employers now want a \"value proposition,\" which he said any job seeker can achieve by showing an AI-generated solution to a company's specific problems.\n\n\"This is the age of: I'm someone who's going to deliver business value,\" Rhoton said. \"Not: I have the right degree.\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNew Penn State football coach Matt Campbell has already started to hit the ground running on establishing a new identity in State College after building and maintaining a foundation of consistency in Ames across the last decade.\n\nIn doing so, he knows a thing or two about team culture, chemistry and what a winning tradition looks like. He sat down with Josh Pate on the \"Pate Speaker Series\" to unveil his vision.\n\n“We’re going to have to prove it,\" Campbell said. \"Words are great, but we’re going to have to prove it.\"\n\nPenn State underachieved massively this past season, as it limped its way to a bowl game at 6-6 after beginning the year as the preseason No. 2 team in the nation before James Franklin was fired midseason after a berth in the College Football Playoff was no longer sustainable.\n\nCampbell intends to ensure a repeat doesn't happen next fall.\n\n“Toughness still wins in this sport. … Mentally and physically tough.

That’s what’s going to have to reside at Penn State.\"\n\nCampbell certainly has his work cut out for him, but if anything, if there's someone who has done a similar turnaround before, it's him. It just happens to be alongside the biggest job he's ever had in his coaching career.\n\nFor now, though it remains to be seen whether he's still ends up being the right man for the job. We will find out next fall.",

    "title": "Developmental Programs in College Football: Claims vs Execution",
    "description": "Why having a developmental program isn't bad.",
    "fullText": "Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano has made many claims that the Scarlet Knights are a “developmental program”, and for good reason. Over the years, Schiano and his company have taken lower-graded talent, even walk-ons, and turned them into capable starters at the college level. A few recent notable examples of this are offensive tackle Hollin Pierce (walk-on), wide receiver Christian Dremel (walk-on), cornerback Christian Braswell (two-star), safety Christian Izien (three-star), and running back Kyle Monangai (a low three-star). Out of those five players, four have landed on NFL teams, largely due to their exceptional development in college.\n\nThat development has continued into 2025 and has paid dividends on offense last season. Players like KJ Duff, Antwan Raymond, Athan Kaliakmanis, and many of the offensive linemen looked better this season than last. In other words, their college development continued at a very solid pace through the offseason. However, that trend did not continue on the defensive side of the ball. In fact, many players regressed in some areas.\n\nFor example, many of the transfers Rutgers brought in were completely ineffective. There were questions on whether grabbing players from lower levels would help the Knights, since it is a large jump from the group of five to the Big Ten, but to be reduced to what they were just doesn’t make sense. Not only were players like Bradley Weaver, Jett Elad, Eric O’Neill, and Jacobie Henderson solid starters at the lower level, they were stars. Stars who should have been able to adjust to the Big Ten if given the proper guidance. If a few of the defensive portal additions didn’t adjust properly, that would be a different story. However, since none of them did, other than Elad and O’Neill to a very late and very limited degree, it becomes clear that they were not developed properly to compete at this level once they got here.\n\nThe examples continue with returning players as well. Linebacker Dariel Djabome was a star for Rutgers last season. Safety Kaj Sanders showed a lot of promise in his freshman season. Both of them took a step back this season under new position coaches. Players don’t just forget how to play football. Stars don’t just forget how to be stars. The development from last year to this year did not continue, and as a result, players regressed.\n\nMany of the Rutgers faithful are disgruntled with the term “developmental program.” However, how much of that hostility has stemmed from the reality that this so-called developmental program did not develop much last season on defense? If the transfers were developed to be Big Ten-ready, and if the talent from last season on defense continued its progression, the term developmental program would seem more fitting. Perhaps it is not the notion of being a developmental program that’s the issue, but rather the execution of those claims.\n\nRutgers under Greg Schiano will always have the mindset of being a developmental program, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, especially for a program like Rutgers that can’t just recruit several five stars year in and year out. On offense this season, they showed that they can do just that. However, it is the several poor and inexperienced defensive coaching hires that the Knights have made that have made them deviate from actually developing the players on that side of the ball. If Rutgers football can make the appropriate coaching hires on defense this offseason, it should be able to get back on track towards becoming a better overall team.",

    "title": "From Dan Lanning to Bob Chesney; ranking the top HC's in the CFP",
    "description": "With the College Football Playoffs fast approaching, we ranked the top head coaches in the field.",
    "fullText": "In football, the head coach's decisions have the ability to swing games, whether it's a head-scratching play-call or a botched end-of-game situation. Those decisions are magnified in a postseason setting, which is exactly the stakes of the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe best coaches are able to manage the game to their advantage, giving their players the best possible chance to go out and succeed. But others unintentionally find ways to undercut their players and team, resulting in a loss that could've been a win simply with better coaching.\n\nThe 2025 edition of the CFP features a number of high-level coaches.\n\nEven the head coaches of the Group of Five teams in the field, James Madison's Bob Chesney and Tulane's Jon Sumrall, will not be back at their respective programs after accepting Power 4 head coaching positions. Some have championship pedigree; others are just kicking open the door of their careers. One coach, due to the nature of college football in 2025, has never been a head coach but will be thrust into the spotlight come the first round.\n\nIn this piece, we'll be ranking each head coach participating in the CFP from 12 to 1, taking into account all the duties that it takes to be a head football coach in the playoff.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-1, 7-1 SEC\n\nAs a result of Lane Kiffin's pre-CFP departure to LSU, Pete Golding was named the head coach of the Rebels both in the playoff and moving forward. Though he's fielded solid units during his three seasons as the defensive coordinator, it wouldn't be responsible to rank him anywhere else but 12th on this list, as he's never been the head coach for a game at the college level.\n\n2025 Team Record: 10-2, 6-2 ACC\n\nMario Cristobal as a recruiter and Mario Cristobal as a football coach are two different things and thus would place him at different spot on this list. But as a football coach, the former Ducks head man has made numerous questionable on-field decisions during his time with Miami. Let's not forget, two ACC losses had the Hurricanes relying on a win all the way back in August against a Notre Dame quarterback in CJ Carr making his first career start just to eke their way into the final at-large spot.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-2, 8-1 AAC\n\nHaving accepted the head coaching job at Florida, this will be Jon Sumrall's final ride with the Green Wave. He's shown himself as someone who can turn programs around, as he took over a five-win Troy program in 2022 and immediately won 23 combined games in two seasons before taking the Tulane job. The Green Wave won 11 games before he got there and he's more than kept them afloat, elevating them to a playoff appearance. Despite making the CFP, Sumrall's team isn't particularly great at anything and is just 50th in scoring defense, his speciality. For those reasons, Sumrall, still a very good coach and worthy of the Gators' job, lands at No. 10.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 9-0 Sun Belt Conference\n\nTaking over the James Madison program ahead of 2024 season after leading Holy Cross to five consecutive Patriot League titles, the winning ways have continued for the Dukes under Bob Chesney. Curt Cignetti lifted up the program as they became an FBS team in 2022, and Chesney has done even better. The 48-year-old is still relatively on the younger side as a head coach and has proven himself to be a tremendous leader of men in his 16 years as a head coach — so much so that he was hired by UCLA to try to resurrect the Bruins' program.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-1, 7-1 SEC\n\nIt's hard to argue with Mike Elko's record this season, but due to the disappointments of last season's 8-5 campaign and Las Vegas Bowl meltdown loss to the USC Trojans, it's hard to put him any higher on this list. A 7-5 season in 2023 at Duke managed to get him hired to lead the Aggies program and he's done what's asked of him in leading them to the playoff. But you're unlikely to hear Elko's name uttered amongst the inner circle of college football head coaches anytime soon.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 9-1 Big 12\n\nJoey McGuire's in a similar spot as Elko, as he's unlikely to be mentioned with the top head coaches in the sport. Despite that, he's done a good job with this Red Raiders team, albeit with an influx in NIL compensation and transfer portal talent. Regardless, McGuire is ultimately responsible for the coalition of the team as a whole and they've meshed about as well as anyone could've hoped.\n\n2025 Team Record: 10-3, 7-2 SEC\n\nDeBoar catches a lot of heat whenever Alabama loses, but it's always worth a reminder that he's following the legend of Nick Saban — who is un-followable and the Crimson Tide job was always going to be a tough one once he retired because the expectations are set through the roof. All things considered, DeBoer has handled it relatively well. Where he excels is on the offensive side of the ball, as he led an explosive Washington offense in 2023 to the national title game and has the Tide averaging over 30 points per game in the rugged SEC.\n\n2025 Team Record: 10-2, 6-2 SEC\n\nBrent Venables' coaching tenure at Oklahoma has been mired with two disappointing 6-7 seasons, but his defensive coaching prowess has been on full display in 2025, completely carrying him to a top five spot. Despite battling SEC teams for eight of their games, the Sooners' defense ranks seventh in scoring defense and ninth in scoring defense. Without those efforts on that side of the ball, Venables and Oklahoma wouldn't be anywhere close to the position they're in.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 9-1 Big Ten\n\nThere's a clear top four of head coaches in the CFP and Ryan Day just barely misses out on the top three. Yes, he has an 82-11 record, won a national championship last season and just extinguished his four-game losing streak to the rival Michigan Wolverines. But much of the Buckeyes' successes have been due to the coordinator and position coaches, who have been extremely highly-regarded. Day doesn't project as a \"leader of men\" type of coach nor as an X's and O's guy. He's the conductor of the whole show for Ohio State and deserves credit for the national title, but falls behind the following three coaches.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 8-1 SEC\n\nOne of the best things about Kirby Smart during his time at Georgia has been that the Bulldogs have an identity. They know exactly who they are as a team, as they'll punch you in the mouth and drag you to the deep end. It's a mentality thing and one that Smart has instilled within the culture of his program. He's won two national championships and come close to more, with this season presenting itself as another opportunity. Off-the-field player issues aside, Smart is one of the golden standards of head football coaches in the sport.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-1, 8-1 Big Ten\n\nDan Lanning's defensive prowess showed perhaps this season more than any other during his four-year tenure with the Oregon Ducks, but it was his ability to motivate his players that stuck out the most. Any slight against his program gets used to his advantage, as his motivational tactics are top notch. The only thing missing for Lanning — though to be fair it is just his fourth season — is postseason success, as he hasn't led the Ducks to a playoff win. He'll have a good chance to do so in Oregon's first-round matchup with Chesney's James Madison squad.\n\n2025 Team Record: 13-0, 10-0 Big Ten\n\nI mean, just Google him. All Curt Cignetti does is win, and he's done it at every stop. He elevated James Madison into an 11-win team in his second season and has completely uplifted the entire Indiana program from the bottom of the conference and resigned to being a \"basketball school\" to what it is today: champions of the Big Ten and the No. 1 seed in the CFP. Meanwhile, he had a scowl on his face after the conference title game. Cignetti is never satisfied with success and has him team on the path of winning a national championship.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Ranking the top head coaches in the 2025 CFP field",

    "description": "I got pregnant with my daughter in college. Eighteen years later, I can't imagine my daughter being pregnant as she's about to start her new life.",
    "fullText": "I've been helping my 17-year-old daughter, a senior in high school, apply to college.\n\nI've watched her type her applications, and it sparked a flashback to when I sat in the kitchen of my run-down college apartment and learned I was pregnant with her.\n\nI'll never forget the look of the brown linoleum floor illuminated under the harsh fluorescent light, its buzzing the only other sound competing with my sobs. My boyfriend held his head in his hands, the positive pregnancy tests fanned around him like the color sticks at a nail salon.\n\nIs it really possible that I was only a few years older than my daughter is right now? She, who still prefers me to run in and grab the smoothie I preordered because she doesn't like to talk to people? The girl whose room is messier than I ever thought possible? The one whose kindergarten picture was so perfect it took my breath away?\n\nI can't even fathom what it would look like for her to be facing down motherhood in a few short years, so it's stirred some new emotions up for me.\n\nI distinctly remember my boyfriend picking me up for class at the beginning of that semester. The sun was shining, my gold hoops were swinging, and as I hopped into his truck, I felt a surge of hope and excitement for the future.\n\nThat was a few weeks before I would realize that my period was not coming after all. Looking at my daughter now, it's finally hitting me: I was so young.\n\nThe naive self-confidence of my younger, college self crumbled that night in my apartment kitchen, and I can't say that I ever regained it. Becoming a mother at any stage can have that effect on you. It carves you apart, empties you out, and makes you question everything at all times forever.\n\nNow, as my teenage daughter teeters on the cusp of the age I was when I had her, I feel a little bit of loss and grief for my own self at her stage.\n\nSeeing her with the world at her fingertips reminds me of how I felt just before she came into existence. I had no fears. I was confident in a way I would never be again.\n\nBut what I remember the most, among the uncertainty, the anxiety, and the complete reorganizing of myself, is the moment I met her, the instant the nurse laid her on my chest. The moment my newborn baby nestled herself into me, burrowing, it felt as though she had straight into my heart; I felt a complete recognition, like nothing I could ever describe. My only thought was, Oh. It's you.\n\nI remember a complete calm settling into my being, as if we were two souls who had known each other forever, simply meeting again.\n\nI feel like I've spent the past 18 years learning who I am with her and because of her. Overnight, I'm supposed to relearn what it's like to live without her here. I feel a mixture of fear and excitement for her future, much like I did in those early days of her existence.\n\nI also feel grief for the girl I was when I had her, but I don't want her to share in that grief.\n\nI want her to feel the freedom I had at her age, even if I acknowledge the loss of my own.\n\nI want her to have a life I did not have, while never, for a second, feeling guilt for her life.\n\nI want things that feel impossible, for both of us. But she has the world at her fingertips now, and I want so much for her to embrace every bit of it, maybe, selfishly, for both of us.\n\nAnd no matter what happens, I hope and pray that we can always find our way back together, just like that moment we first met, when I can hold her close again and whisper, Oh, it's you.",

    "fullText": "On Saturday, 22-year-old Fernando Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to their first Big Ten championship since 1967 — but the top quarterback's professional résumé looks nearly as impressive as his football record.\n\nWith their 13-10 win over Ohio State, Indiana secured the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history — and Mendoza's performance solidified his Heisman Trophy frontrunner status.\n\nBorn and raised in Miami, Mendoza was a two-star recruit out of high school and overlooked by most Power 4 programs. He was committed to playing at Yale until Cal lost a prospect and called him up with an offer he couldn't turn down: a free education and better football.\n\nAfter three seasons at Cal, where he worked his way up to starting quarterback and graduated from the prestigious Haas School of Business, he transferred to Indiana last winter. The move meant losing his scholarship with Cal, but earning a lot more money in endorsement deals.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, one of the first things he did with his \"name, image, likeness\" earnings was to cover the cost of the two classes he needed to graduate from Cal after his scholarship was terminated.\n\nMendoza, who's now pursuing his master's at Indiana's Kelley School of Business, spends more time on LinkedIn than he does on Instagram, TikTok, or other social platforms.\n\n\"The only social media that's on my phone right now is LinkedIn and YouTube to watch videos,\" he told The Herald Times. He has an Instagram account with more than 80,000 followers, but enlists his younger brother, Alberto, who also plays quarterback for the Hoosiers, to manage it.\n\nA post shared by HeraldTimesOnline (@heraldtimesonline)\n\nMendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also be a top candidate for a job in finance.\n\nHe's spent his last few summers interning at real estate investment firms ACRE and Newmark. Juggling his internships with hours of football practice required a 5:30 a.m. wake-up call and an intricate whiteboard, where he'd keep a running list of action items.\n\nMendoza is just as disciplined with his money as he is with his schedule.\n\n\"He doesn't spend any money on himself,\" his mom told the WSJ. \"All he does is invest.\"\n\nA post shared by Big Ten Network (@bigtennetwork)\n\nHis brother, with whom he shared a room growing up and now shares a car, pointed out that he also doesn't like to spend money on gas.\n\nAlberto told Big Ten Network: \"I go to use the car, and it's empty. There's no more gas in the car, and I'm like, 'We're just gonna use the car and not fill it back up?' And Fernando is like, 'Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.' … And then I have to go to the gas station on like one mile of gas.\"",
