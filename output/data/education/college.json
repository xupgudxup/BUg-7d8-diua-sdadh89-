    "fullText": "This past week was a weird one for upsets. We didn’t get any huge, unexpected upsets of top-tier teams. But we did have some small underdogs pull through on their opponent’s home floor, such as UNC beating Virginia, Texas Tech beating Houston, and Illinois beating Purdue. Let’s see what this week brings!\n\nThe Wildcats have sustained a lot of injuries in the past few weeks, but I don’t think that will matter in this one. We have seen that you beat Vanderbilt by using size and strength in the frontcourt, and this could be a breakout game for any of Malachi Moreno, Andrija Jelavic, or Mo Dioubate.\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide has a myriad of issues going on. Not only are they facing national scrutiny over the eligibility of Charles Bediako, but they also have injuries to Ajay Allen and Aden Holloway. I think there’s just too much going on with Alabama right now for them to be fully focused and engaged with this game, and Missouri has a breakout star emerging in T.O. Barrett.\n\nSean Miller’s Longhorns have shown that they have a high ceiling, coming off a 20-point win over a ranked Georgia team. Auburn has shown us a low floor, with a loss to Missouri already on the schedule. Miller has Dailyn Swain playing the best basketball of his career, and I think he plays a huge role as Texas continues their march to an NCAA Tournament bid in his first season.\n\nI’m going to hop back on my travel schedule soapbox here. Let’s get this straight: Florida State is not good. Cal is better. But FSU has Rodney McCray and Chauncey Wiggins, who both play well at home, and Cal has not won a game outside the state of California this season. I think the road trip gets the better of them here.\n\nSaint Louis is rolling right now — if not for a desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer by Stanford, the Billikens would be undefeated. But all good things must come to an end. The “Battle for the Archbaron’s Cup” has been anything but predictable over the years, and would make a great occasion for Dayton to pull off the upset. Dayton finally has their two centers, Amael L’Etang and Malcolm Thomas, healthy, and may also get back Jordan Derkack for this game.\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nCFB:Most impactful transfer of 2025 college football season\n\nNBA: NBA star Derrick Rose reacts after unexpected surprise ahead of jersey retirement\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl LX graphic resurfaces\n\nTENNIS: Valentin Vacherot hits physics-defying shot at Australian Open\n\nVIRAL: Alex Honnold takes incredible selfie after historic Taipei 101 climb\n\nThe post Predicting upsets in College Basketball this week   appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Depending on the position, a high school diploma could be the ticket to a growing, high-paying job.\n\nBusiness Insider looked at wages and growth projections for jobs that usually need a high school diploma, its equivalent, or a postsecondary nondegree award. We then took the geometric mean of the ones that pay at least $75,000, based on 2024 median annual wage data, and are expected to need more workers, based on projected employment growth from 2024 to 2034. We then ranked the jobs, with the larger the geometric mean, the better the rank.\n\nMany of the top 12 fell into one of three job groups: construction and extraction; protective service; or installation, maintenance, and repair.\n\nFirst-line supervisors of construction trades and extraction workers took the top spot. Employment of these supervisors is expected to grow by 49,000 from its 2024 level, and they typically make about $79,000 annually. It's also one of the roles that typically don't require a degree, but often require job seekers to have relevant experience.\n\nEmployers may be interested in candidates with higher educational attainment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said commercial pilots usually need a postsecondary nondegree award, but some employers may prefer a degree or even require it.\n\nBelow are the top 12, along with information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nTypical education required: High school diploma or equivalent\n\nTypical education required: Postsecondary nondegree award\n\nTypical education required: Postsecondary nondegree award\n\nTypical education required: Postsecondary nondegree award\n\nTypical education required: Postsecondary nondegree award\n\nTypical education required: Postsecondary nondegree award\n\nTypical education required: High school diploma or equivalent\n\nTypical education required: High school diploma or equivalent\n\nTypical education required: High school diploma or equivalent\n\nTypical education required: High school diploma or equivalent\n\nTypical education required: High school diploma or equivalent\n\nTypical education required: High school diploma or equivalent",

    "fullText": "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has laid out an NFL-style system of fines for his players if they violate team rules, including $500 for being late to practice.\n\nHe showed it on the video screen in his first team meeting of 2026 on Jan. 23, as briefly seen in a video posted by his oldest son, Deion Jr. Here is what it said:\n\nLate to meeting or film session: $400\n\nNo-show to meeting or film session: $2,000\n\nLate to strength and conditioning workout: $1,000\n\nNo-show to strength and conditioning workout: $1,500\n\nViolation of team rules: $1,000-$2,500 based on severity.\n\nPublic or social media misconduct: $2,000-$5,000\n\nDamage to university or team property: repair cost +$3,000\n\nLoss of team technology or equipment: replacement cost +$1,000\n\nPlayers also are required to wear Nike shoes and apparel while representing the university at practices, games and organized team activities. Colorado has been a Nike-sponsored school since 1995. Sanders also is sponsored by Nike. Failure to comply also could result in disciplinary action.\n\nThere is an appeal process for players, with final decisions issued within five business days. But it's another example of the professionalization of college sports, with players this year getting paid directly by schools for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nA lack of discipline also apparently was an issue for Colorado last year, when the Buffaloes finished 3-9 during Sanders’ third season in charge.\n\n“All these lates and tardies and all these things, we can’t have that this year,” Colorado receivers coach Jason Phillips told the team. “Those are the things we will eliminate… Two ways to eliminate that. Either you change, or we change you.”\n\nSanders has brought in 42 new scholarship transfer players this year, offsetting more than 35 scholarship players who transferred out.\n\n“You all are hand-picked, hand-picked, hand-picked,” Sanders told the team. “We watched darn near every one of y’all.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

    "fullText": "The 2000s brought about a new archetype of character into pop culture: the “anti-hero.” Exemplified on television with the likes of Walter White and Tony Soprano, the anti-hero is a character who is by no means evil, but often has to do bad things as a means to an end.\n\nIn College Basketball, we’ve seen our share of heroes and villains through the years (here’s looking at you, Grayson Allen). But Charles Bediako, in the year 2025, is the exact anti-hero that the sport needs. His situation should bring about the necessary change that can save college basketball.\n\nIf the name Charles Bediako sounded familiar before he made national headlines this week, it’s because he was the starting center for Alabama in the 2022-2023 season. This team was notable not just because they were the #1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, but also because they had an active team member commit a murder midseason\n\nThey also had a star player and future top-5 NBA draft pick, Brandon Miller, who faced scrutiny over how involved he was in the said murder, in which he would eventually face no charges. That Alabama team was a national story every week that season.\n\nAfter the season ended, Bediako declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his remaining college eligibility. He would then play two full seasons in the G-League, never once getting called up to play in the NBA. And now, with the lines more blurred than ever in terms of what is allowed or not allowed in college basketball, he’s back playing for the Crimson Tide.\n\nWhile the NCAA has officially ruled him ineligible to continue to play college basketball, Bediako got a temporary restraining order from an Alabama judge (who happens to have ties to the program), allowing him to play games in the state of Alabama. Bediako shined in Alabama’s loss to Tennessee on Saturday, scoring 13 points in 25 minutes off the bench.\n\nIf it sounds villainous for someone to go behind the NCAA’s back to try to allow themselves to play in a sport that they left almost three years ago, that’s what makes Bediako the perfect anti-hero. No one can put individual blame on Bediako or on coach Nate Oats for this particular situation. Nate Oats’s career is defined by winning basketball games. And if Bediako can help him win, of course, he’s going to fight to get him back on the roster.\n\nFor Bediako, his goal is to continue to play basketball for as long as he can and make as much money as he can while doing it. So, if he’s not going to get called up to the NBA, and his G-League timer is not getting any longer, why not explore this option of getting to play again at Alabama? You simply can’t blame either Bediako or Oats for this predicament — they’re behaving rationally in their own self-interests.\n\nInstead, blame the NCAA. The NIL era has allowed “the line” to continue to change. What do I mean when I say “the line”? The line is the thing that, once a player crosses, he can no longer come back to college basketball. The line simply used to be “declare for the NBA draft.”\n\nThen it moved to “declare for the draft and hire an agent.” When NIL made agents more commonplace, it then became “play in a professional, pay-to-play” basketball league. But then, players like Creighton’s Fedor Zugic, who had played professionally in Europe, began to challenge this convention.\n\nThen, you have Baylor’s James Nnaji, who was drafted by the NBA but played professionally overseas, being allowed to play college basketball this season. What makes the Bediako situation even more interesting is that Abdullah Ahmed, a player who played in the G-League before ever playing college basketball, is being allowed to play for BYU this season.\n\nSo, I say all of this to say, where is “the line”? And has Bediako crossed it? The Bediako situation is so unique and represents such a unique series of events that it is going to force the NCAA into redefining where the line is and creating a uniform, inarguable policy that will make these situations much more black and white in the future, instead of living in the gray area of temporary restraining orders and court cases.\n\nThat would bring about a positive change to the sport in the long run, which would make Bediako the ultimate anti-hero. Not unlike how Ed O’Bannon became the face of the early NIL movement, Bediako can become the face of the line between professional and college basketball.\n\nCheck out all of our NFL articles: https://www.thebiglead.com/category/nfl/\n\nThe post One of College Basketball’s most controversial decisions has a new twist  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Anna Kendrick, 40, says watching her friends go to college made her second-guess her decision to pursue acting.\n\n\"I was really, really jealous of all my friends that were going to college. Number one, because I felt really insecure about not going to college. I have a whole, you know, complex about it,\" Kendrick said on Friday's episode of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nSeeing her friends quickly build community through classes and sororities made her feel even more unsure as she tried to find her footing in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I was 17 or 18. It's really hard to make friends in LA because of, like, the way the city is laid out, but especially when you don't have a fake ID. Even if I did, I looked about 12, so that wasn't going to work anyway,\" Kendrick said. \"And I was just like absolutely terrified and really wondering if I was like, making a huge mistake.\"\n\nHer perspective began to change when her friends hit sophomore year and had to start figuring out their future paths.\n\n\"Even though the thing that I wanted felt like a total pipe dream, and like, 'What am I doing? This is a disaster. It's so hard to carve out a space for yourself in this industry,'\" Kendrick said.\n\n\"But on the other side of it, holy shit, I did not think like, what a blessing to just know what I want. I was like watching all my friends go, 'Oh my god, I don't know what I want, what to do,'\" she continued.\n\nThe \"Pitch Perfect\" star said her decision not to go to college felt especially difficult because it went against the path her family valued.\n\n\"I was like the first person to not go to college. And my dad was a teacher and everything, so it was like very black sheep behavior to not go to college,\" Kendrick said.\n\nShe added her parents weren't thrilled with her decision, but accepted that she was going to do what she wanted. At the same time, her parents saw college as something she could revisit if acting didn't work out.\n\n\"I think there was always that sense of like, well, if things maybe don't work out that first year, it's not too late to just, you know, so I think that was always like something that they had in mind,\" Kendrick said.\n\nIt also didn't help that questions about college kept coming up when she was in her early 20s, before her acting career had fully taken off.\n\n\"Like, oh my god, I have to say I didn't. And at that point, you know, like 21, 22, I didn't really have much to show for it yet,\" Kendrick said.\n\nKendrick isn't the only Hollywood celebrity who has spoken about not going to college.\n\n\"Harry Potter\" star Daniel Radcliffe told E! News in 2013 that he skipped college because he \"already knew\" what he wanted to do.\n\n\"I think a large part of why people go to college is to figure out what they want to do,\" he said. \"I very much knew what I wanted to do, so I kind of just figured I'd keep carrying on trying to do that.\"\n\nIn 2024, Julia Roberts told British Vogue that she regrets not going to university.\n\n\"It wasn't in my cards,\" Roberts said, adding that her family didn't have the money and she \"had no scholarship potential.\"",

    "fullText": "Growing up in Concord, North Carolina, just outside Charlotte, Jacob Palmer was a classic academic achiever. “I was a good student,” he said in an interview with Fortune. “In high school, I participated in all types of extracurriculars, student leadership, I did a lot of public speaking. I had all sorts of friends.” But he said something changed during the pandemic. “School looked drastically different doing online classes and Zoom calls. It felt very intangible.” He said he figured out pretty quickly that online college “didn’t work for me. I hated it.”\n\nPalmer said that instead of sticking with college, he tried things out, including a stint at a FedEx warehouse for several months, and a change of scenery at his grandparents in rural Virginia, where he worked at a factory for a few months.\n\nWhen he returned home, in need of a job, his mom was putting in a hot tub and she mentioned the electrician working on it was “super passionate and loved his job.” Palmer said he sounded him out, estimating that the electrician was about 29 at the time, and Palmer liked that he worked for himself.\n\n“I had a general interest in working with my hands, fixing and making things, as well as a basic understanding of electrical theory from my time in AP Physics class,” he said. Soon afterward, he started as a full-time apprentice at a small, Charlotte-based contracting firm, earning $15 an hour at first and working his way up the ladder.\n\nHe was far from alone. Palmer’s micro-generation abandoned college in droves during the pandemic, driving 42% of an overall 15% decline in undergraduate enrollment between fall 2010 and fall 2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Overall, college may have peaked, as experts have predicted a “demographic cliff” ever since 2007, when Americans started having fewer children with the coming of the Great Recession, and birthrates have not recovered since, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Palmer was part of a movement deciding to try something else instead of college.\n\n“I spent a few years just untangling the extension cords and doing the grunt work,” he said, earning hours en route to sitting for an electrical license. But even though he didn’t become a college student, he still found himself studying hard, because he had to pass his licensing exam, in January 2024. Just a month later, at 21, he opened his own business, Palmer Electrical. By the end of that year, according to profit and loss statements reviewed by Fortune, he grossed nearly $90,000. This nearly doubled to $175,000 in 2025 and he said he was “thinking $250,000 is a good goal for 2026, but my main focus is still to continue learning and make new opportunities.”",

    "description": "Every Sunday night, my family came together for dinner. But now that both of my sons are in college and I'm an empty nester, I bring dinner to them.",
    "fullText": "In my family, Sunday was always family dinner night. Whether the Packers earned another triumphant win, a swim meet went late, or a last-minute homework assignment loomed on Monday morning, that time to eat and enjoy each other's company was an appointment that could not be canceled.\n\nWhen my two boys headed off to college, Sundays became more subdued. Yes, my husband and I opened a bottle of wine and enjoyed our dinner leisurely, but I craved more. The meal needed something; it needed that seasoning from my sons' snarky retort, a roaring laugh, and even that persistent eye roll.\n\nSince I missed our weekly family dinners, I started a monthly family pizza night across the miles.\n\nThe idea is simple: I pick a day and time, compile the orders, and everyone gets a pizza delivery at the same time. Whether it is my oldest, who wants copious amounts of meat on that slice, or the younger one, who prefers variety, I order enough for everyone — including all the roommates and friends. Then we jump on video calls and chat while we eat.\n\nThe phrase \"everyone is family at the table\" is cliché, but everyone is welcome to join. No, I do not force friends to chat, but they must appreciate my \"rules.\" It is not rapid-fire Socratic questioning, but people cannot just devour food and disappear.\n\nEveryone sends pizza photos, curious comments, and FaceTimes while we are eating. Yes, it sounds like the dinner parties people hosted in 2020, but it works. We catch up, laugh, and just have a collective moment.\n\nSure, I cannot cajole the boys as easily through a screen, but I can get a response that is more than just a one-word text reply.\n\nOf course, some people will say I'm bribing my kids to interact with me, but it doesn't matter to me. The reality is that family traditions are not just holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions. Making time for each other is vital, and food can be the catalyst.\n\nAt, around, and by the table, I have learned much about my sons over the years. It was more than excitement over a good grade or disappointment about a lost swim race. I have seen their better understanding of personal relationships, their appreciation for culture, and their interest in family history.\n\nListening to their word choices and argument construction, and even just watching them sit quietly, is far more telling than another call or text when they are away from home. I might have nurtured them with food, but they grew into the men that they are today because of our family connection.\n\nThis current pizza dinner might be a slice of what we had, but it is one that I crave even more.\n\nWhile my pizza night family dinner solution works with college kids, I look forward to keeping this tradition going long after they graduate. Whether one is in Florida and the other is halfway around the world, we can and should make our family a priority. Every overlooked opportunity is a missed one.\n\nSince pizza, or some version of flatbread, can be found anywhere in the world, there are no excuses for skipping this dinner. Even on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean, family pizza night is on the schedule. No matter how I slice it, the concept works.\n\nFor any parent looking to keep family bonds strong, creative solutions are all around. Whether it is a pizza, grandma's cookies, or a Big Mac, food is a form of communication. My family tradition tells my boys that the time we spend together nourishes me far beyond the food served on the plate.",

    "title": "Two brothers skipped college to start a pickleball company before the game was cool. They cashed in on the pandemic boom and expect 9 figures in revenue in 2026.",
    "description": "Brothers Rob and Mike Barnes started Selkirk Sport in 2014, when they were just 19 and 22 — and when pickleball was considered \"a senior sport.\"",
    "fullText": "If you play pickleball, you've probably seen a Selkirk paddle on the court. You might even use one yourself.\n\nThe Idaho-based, family-run company Selkirk Sport has become practically synonymous with pickleball. It makes premium paddles, shoes, apparel, balls, and nets — \"everything except the court surface,\" said Tom Barnes, the youngest of the three brothers who co-own the company.\n\nThere's just one nonnegotiable: Whatever they produce has to stay in the pickleball lane.\n\n\"We will only ever do pickleball. This was intentional from day one,\" Tom, the director of R&D, told Business Insider during a tour of the company's innovation lab in Coeur d'Alene, where paddles are put through rigorous stress testing using cannons and CT scanners. \"It's called Selkirk Sport. It's not called Selkirk Sports.\"\n\nTom joined the company after his older brothers, Mike and Rob, who started Selkirk alongside their father, Jim, in 2014. At the time, Mike and Rob were just 19 and 22, but it wasn't their first venture.\n\nA few years prior, they'd started a company selling airsoft equipment out of their dad's basement. It was part of a homeschool project. Jim, a retired fireman, saw value in teaching his kids entrepreneurial skills. The company quickly outgrew the basement and took over their childhood home. By 2013, they had leased a small building.\n\nFor a short time, they ran both companies simultaneously, but eventually sold the airsoft business and chose to skip college to go all-in on Selkirk.\n\nIt was a risk. Back then, pickleball had a very different reputation. It was considered \"a senior sport,\" said Rob. He and Mike, who first discovered the game at a local rec center in 2009 and were immediately hooked, were convinced it would take off beyond the retirement community.\n\nThey were right, but it took years — and a global pandemic that encouraged socially distant activities — before the rest of the country caught on.\n\nThe Barnes brothers saw a lot of opportunity in the pickleball space, as there was virtually zero competition.\n\nThe paddle market was wide open, said Mike: \"Everyone had basically the same paddle. There wasn't innovation. There wasn't anything new.\"\n\nThey set out to change that. Their first year in business, 2014, was pure trial and error. They sourced materials, assembled paddles themselves, and tested and tweaked them until they were satisfied.\n\n\"It was definitely more of an art form than a science back then,\" Rob said.\n\nToday, Selkirk has invested millions into an in-house innovation lab dedicated to understanding the physics of pickleball and building high-performance equipment. But, for years, the company broke even, and the brothers barely paid themselves, despite working 100-hour weeks.\n\n\"I calculated it once,\" Mike said. \"When you factor in the hours we worked versus what we paid ourselves, we probably made less than minimum wage for the first eight years.\"\n\nThey never felt discouraged. Pickleball continued gaining traction, and the company grew every year. They said Selkirk has posted double-digit annual growth over the past decade.\n\nThen, the pandemic hit. After a brief shutdown during which public parks and courts were closed, pickleball emerged as a safe, socially distanced activity.\n\n\"And then it just kind of never stopped.\"\n\nAs pickleball has continued to win over Americans — it's been deemed the fastest-growing sport in the US three years in a row by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association (SFIA) — the market has become increasingly competitive.\n\nIn the early years, the brothers were competing with five to 10 brands. Now, it's closer to 600, said Mike: \"After the pandemic, interest rates were low. Lots of easy money and investment flowed into the sport, and so the number of brands exploded.\"\n\nConcentrating on one sport, Mike said, is their edge.\n\n\"We think our ability to focus is one of our secret weapons. You've seen major brands like Head and Adidas try to enter the pickleball market, but they've been really struggling to make an impact. We see pickleball more like golf, where you need to be an endemic brand that's really focused.\"\n\nIt's worked so far. Selkirk went from 16 employees in January 2019 to 230 by January 2026, and said revenue has increased by 1,900% since 2019. The company fulfills roughly 1,000 orders a day and up to 2,500 during the holiday season. They also have more than 1,400 retail partners, including Dick's Sporting Goods and Target, as well as an exclusive partnership with Costco.\n\nThe brothers plan to stay ahead by continuing to invest in R&D to deliver premium products.\n\nOutside capital will help with that.\n\nEarlier this year, Selkirk took its first-ever institutional funding: a $30 million growth equity investment from Bluestone Equity Partners, Forbes reported. It also reported that Selkirk expects to generate at least $100 million in revenue in 2026.\n\nThose are big numbers, but it's been more than a decade in the making, Mike pointed out: \"It's a lot of work. I think there's a lot of glamour nowadays — a lot of hype about what it means to be an entrepreneur — and, at the end of the day, it is about doing the boring things and just waking up and being consistent every day.\"\n\nTaking a chance on a game they believed had potential before most everyone else did helped, added Rob: \"We got into pickleball before it was cool. If you're waiting to jump into the latest trend, you're probably too late.\"",

    "fullText": "Louisville women’s basketball hosting Boston College on Saturday had all the makings of a trap game.\n\nThe seventh-ranked Cardinals were coming off two difficult wins, at Notre Dame and N.C. State, the weekend before. Then, their game against the Eagles, who were on a 13-game losing streak, had to be played a day early due to Winter Storm Fern. Louisville (19-3, 9-0 ACC) didn’t have the cleanest start to the game, turning the ball over six times in the first quarter. But the squad proved its ability to push through mistakes and avoid the trap, recording a 85-56 win over Boston College (4-18,0-9) at the KFC Yum! Center.\n\nUofL downing N.C. State and Notre Dame on the road showed how high its celling could be. Avoiding a letup in less competitive games will be critical for the Cardinals as they remain in the hunt for a regular-season ACC championship. Four of the Cardinals' final nine ACC opponents have losing records in conference play.\n\nMackenly Randolph took her turn leading the Cardinals with a career high-tying 13 points as the team recorded its 12th straight victory. It was the sixth straight game where UofL had a different leading scorer. The offense was needed to make up for the team’s turnover problem, many of which have been unforced. Louisville had a combined 21 turnovers against the Wolfpack and Irish last weekend but had 16 after the third quarter against Boston College.\n\nThe Eagles only totaled nine points off the miscues as part of a struggling offense that knocked down 29% of its shots from the field.\n\nWhen they weren’t turning it over, the Cardinals were efficient shooters. They made 55% of their field goals with all 12 of their available players entering the scoring column. UofL built a 10-0 lead in the first quarter, and Boston College never got closer than eight points for the rest of the game. The Cardinals’ lead ballooned to 42 points in the first four minutes of the fourth quarter, and the squad sailed to a win.\n\nLouisville has a road trip out west next week, beginning with Stanford at 8 p.m. Thursday and California at 2 p.m. next Sunday.\n\nReach Louisville football, women's basketball and baseball beat writer Alexis Cubit at acubit@gannett.com and follow her on X at @Alexis_Cubit.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Boston College vs Louisville women's basketball score, ACC standings",

    "fullText": "The Tennessee Volunteers look to get their season back on track as they head to Tuscaloosa for a showdown with the No. 17 Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nTennessee has lost three of its last five, but that slide can’t be pinned on five-star freshman Nate Ament, who I’m backing to have a big game in my Tennessee vs. Alabama predictions.\n\nHere are my best free college basketball picks for this conference clash on Saturday, January 24.\n\nTennessee vs Alabama best bet: Nate Ament Over 15.5 points (-120)\n\nTennessee forward Nate Ament is averaging 15.4 points and 6.3 rebounds per game and has shown improved efficiency of late. The silky-smooth 6-foot-10 freshman is shooting 49.1% from the field over his last six games after connecting at just a 38% clip across his first 12 contests.\n\nAment has scored 17 or more points in three straight games and draws a favorable matchup tonight against an Alabama team that plays at a blazing-fast pace while offering little resistance on defense.\n\nThe Crimson Tide are 329th nationally in points allowed per game (82.6), with that number ballooning to 86.8 against high-major opponents. They also sit outside the top 300 in free throws allowed per game (25.2), while Ament ranks in the top 15th percentile in free-throw rate.\n\nAment’s ability to score in transition and consistently get to the line should help him eclipse his points total tonight.\n\nLet’s also back Ament to have a productive night on the glass, as Alabama’s extremely fast tempo has the Tide ranked 358th in rebounds allowed per game (41.3).\n\nTennessee hasn’t looked great of late, but neither has Alabama, which is 2–7 ATS in its last nine games against Top-100 KenPom opponents at home. The Vols check in at No. 23 at KenPom and are 14th in adjusted defensive efficiency.\n\nTennessee would have a solid chance to cover this spread even if the Tide were at full strength, and that may not be the case. Alabama’s second- and third-leading scorers, Aden Holloway and Amari Allen, have both been downgraded to questionable for tonight.\n\nWith the Tide possibly missing their second and third-highest scorers against a strong Vols defense, I'm leaning towards the Under on a lofty total.\n\nThe Under has cashed in 10 of 12 meetings between these SEC foes during Rick Barnes' tenure.\n\nSpread: Tennessee +6.5 (-110) | Alabama -6.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Tennessee +230 | Alabama -280\n\nOver/Under: Over 167.5 (-110) | Under 167.5 (-110)\n\nThe Vols have gone 4-0 SU and 3-1 ATS in the last four meetings between these conference foes.

    "description": "D1 college football was my entire life, so when it ended, I completely lost myself and gained weight. I turned to boxing to lose 120 pounds.",
    "fullText": "When my D1 college football career ended, I didn't just lose the game. I lost my identity.\n\nFootball had structured my entire life: my schedule, my body, my purpose. When that structure disappeared, I didn't know who I was anymore. I had been living what I now recognize as a lukewarm lifestyle, doing just enough to get by, but not anchored in anything solid. Without football, there was nothing left to lean on.\n\nI let my life deteriorate, and it took a lot to get back on track.\n\nGrief and uncertainty compounded quickly. I withdrew from people. I stopped training. I stopped caring for my body. I gained weight rapidly and avoided mirrors. By the time I finally confronted reality, I weighed around 300 pounds.\n\nAt my lowest point, I was living at home and working at FedEx, making roughly $400 a week. There is nothing wrong with honest work, but for me, it symbolized how far I had fallen from the man I once believed I was called to be.\n\nI wasn't just overweight. I felt directionless, embarrassed, and spiritually empty.\n\nOne night, exhausted and overwhelmed, I prayed honestly for the first time in a long time. I didn't ask for success or shortcuts. I asked for strength, clarity, and the courage to face myself. That prayer didn't change everything overnight, but it changed the direction of my life.\n\nWhat followed wasn't motivation. It was obedience, discomfort, and discipline.\n\nI knew I had to get uncomfortable if I wanted a different life. Comfort had nearly destroyed me, so I started showing up early, doing things that scared me, and putting myself in environments that demanded confidence before I felt ready. Faith gave me the foundation, but discipline gave me the reps.\n\nI didn't grow up thinking of myself as violent. I didn't believe I was capable of real aggression or dominance. Stepping into a boxing gym changed everything. You can't hide in the ring. Fear, insecurity, and doubt show up immediately. Training humbled me. It also rebuilt me.\n\nSlowly, the weight came off. Over nine months, I lost 120 pounds. The first six months were the most dramatic, nearly 85 pounds, but the physical change was only part of it. I was rebuilding confidence, identity, and belief in myself one disciplined day at a time.\n\nWhen I entered the Houston Golden Gloves tournament, I wasn't chasing a title. I was testing who I had become. Standing in the ring, I realized I wasn't becoming someone new. I was finally operating as the man I always believed I was capable of being. Discipline had uncovered confidence. Faith had restored identity.\n\nThat same approach reshaped the rest of my life.\n\nI transitioned into a new professional path, working remotely. I finally had a financial turnaround. It was the compound effect of disciplined habits applied everywhere.\n\nLosing Clay and losing football forced me to confront a hard truth: Life doesn't pause to let you grieve neatly. Loss comes in waves. Without structure and faith, it can pull you under.\n\nWhat I've learned is that rebuilding doesn't start with motivation. It starts with obedience. Discipline creates stability. Faith gives it meaning.",

    "title": "Letters to Sports: Readers debate whether the Dodgers are ruining baseball",
    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times give their thoughts on the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the Rams, the LeBron James-Jeanie Buss rift and college football.",
    "fullText": "The fury over the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker makes me wonder who's shouting the loudest?\n\nCould it be desperate, unfortunate fans whose beloved teams are owned by inheritors, nepo families, or private equity bros who celebrate their glamorous assets?\n\nSo how about a new metric in the sports page to accompany the ranking of teams and players: ownership. Not simply by wealth, but wisdom, brains and commitment. And for fun let's call it the McCourt-Moreno Index.\n\nIt's time we hold the Marge Schotts of pro sports accountable for the franchises they mismanage.\n\nThere are some alarming implications to Bill Plaschke's \"If it blows up baseball, so be it.\" Perhaps he means that MLB should be reduced to a burning garbage heap with three teams atop — Yankees, Cubs and Dodgers — because they were the only ones who went into the TV business and peddled their services for billions in the three largest TV markets.\n\nMaybe he yearns to transform MLB into the NHL of my childhood, with six teams. That was OK if you lived in a shallow arc extending between New York and Chicago — not so good for everyone else.\n\n\"So be it,\" as Plaschke would say, but I can guarantee I won't be the only one who isn't watching anymore.\n\nNaturally Dodger fans are all excited about the signing of the $60-million-a-year All-Star right fielder, Kyle Tucker. But we're not going to be happy when Dodger Stadium becomes the first MLB ballpark with a two-drink minimum.\n\nAs everyone seems to be raving about the Dodgers' acquisition of Kyle Tucker, I note the following: There is another player who was recently signed by the Yankees for less money and less signing bonus than Tucker who had higher numbers last year in average, home runs and WAR. He also plays more positions. Hadn’t the Dodgers heard of Cody Bellinger? Bellinger as a Yankee will never feel right to me.\n\nAsk a Major League Baseball owner like Arte Moreno, who sells out his ballpark whenever the Dodgers come to Anaheim, and sees Angel broadcast ratings surge whenever his team plays the Dodgers, if he thinks the Dodgers are ruining the game.\n\nThe Rams won the battle of which team gets to lose to Seattle.\n\nThe NFL needs to clarify exactly what does and doesn’t constitute pass interference. There is no consistency as to how it's called with each official seeming to have their own definition of what constitutes pass interference. It has gotten to the point where it’s worse than major league umpires and their own definition of the strike zone. NFL, you need to clean this up because these are major calls that are ruining games.\n\nBill Plaschke finally wrote a column about the Lakers with which I agree. LeBron James is the past, Austin Reaves is the future, and $50 million will help the Lakers rebuild. Yes, it's really as simple as that.\n\nWith the Lakers defense costing them multiple games, reminiscent of the coach Mike (no D)'Antoni days, the only real interesting Laker news last week were the alleged Jeanie Buss comments about the King. They sounded like they were lines taken from a scene in \"The Godfather\" .... \"What have I done to make you treat me so disrespectfully.\" My opinion is that it \"was not personal and strictly business.\"\n\nWhen asked after each game how he'd celebrate another victory, Indiana's Curt Cignetti would say, \"With a beer.\" After guiding his team to an undefeated season, and then winning the national championship, I doubt the Hoosiers' coach will ever have to buy another beer again.\n\nLincoln Riley is officially on the clock. In two years Curt Cignetti took a woebegone college team, with nary a five-star player, to an undefeated national championship. Cignetti has proven that, even in the NIL era, coaching matters. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick …\n\nCurt Cignetti and Indiana football playing in and winning the national championship was a modern-day version of the movie \"Hoosiers\" and would have made coach Norman Dale (actor Gene Hackman) proud. Now the question is, can new UCLA football coach Bob Chesney and his 40-plus transfers be the second coming of Indiana? Only time will tell.\n\nKings president Luc Robitaille appears to be happy with the Kings' status quo that appears to be getting one point every game in an overtime or shootout loss.

    "fullText": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A lawyer for fired University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore declared his innocence Thursday and said charges of home invasion and stalking were based on an effort by a staff member to get a financial windfall from the school's “deep pockets.\"\n\nIn a court filing, defense attorney Ellen Michaels responded to allegations that shocked college football in December. It also signals that Moore, who was fired for a relationship with the staffer and arrested hours later, is fighting the charges and wants the case dismissed.\n\n“This Court is not confronted with a close call or a technical defect,” Michaels wrote. “It is confronted with a prosecution that never should have begun.”\n\nMoore was abruptly fired on Dec. 10 for having an inappropriate relationship and for lying during the university's investigation, his dismissal letter states.\n\nAuthorities say Moore later that day entered the woman’s apartment, blamed her for the firing and grabbed butter knives and kitchen scissors while threatening to kill himself.\n\nA prosecutor quoted Moore as telling the woman, “My blood is on your hands.”\n\nMoore, 39, has pleaded not guilty to charges of felony home invasion, stalking and illegal entry.\n\nMichaels said the warrant to arrest Moore was deeply flawed because police wrongly informed a magistrate that Moore had been stalking the woman for months and was dangerous.\n\nMichaels said police relied on misinformation from the woman's personal lawyer, Heidi Sharp, as it investigated what happened. Michaels doesn't dispute that Moore turned up at the woman's apartment, but she claims there's no evidence that she had told him to stay away.\n\n“A magistrate must be given a fair and accurate picture. When the picture is distorted, the warrant cannot stand,” Michaels wrote.\n\nShe accused Sharp of giving information to police to “villainize Mr. Moore and maximize the chances of obtaining a large settlement from the deep pockets of the University of Michigan.”\n\nA message seeking comment from Sharp was not immediately returned.\n\nEarlier Thursday, a judge held a hearing to get an update on the case. Michaels disclosed that she had filed the request to quash the arrest and would argue it at a future date.\n\nWashtenaw County assistant prosecutor Kati Rezmierski said she had just received the filing. The next hearing was set for Feb. 17.\n\nMoore arrived at the courthouse with his wife, Kelli and waited in an adjacent courtroom for his case to be called. He declined to comment but stood nearby when Michaels briefly spoke to reporters and said he's innocent.\n\nMoore coached the Wolverines for two seasons as the successor to Jim Harbaugh, who won a national championship before quitting to become coach of the NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nKyle Whittingham, who coached Utah for two decades, is the new Michigan coach.",

    "fullText": "The Defense Department is rethinking what it means to serve your country, and it no longer necessarily involves a uniform.\n\nThrough a new initiative called the US Tech Force, the federal government is recruiting college students and Silicon Valley's brightest to spend two years modernizing government systems, working as engineers, data scientists, and technical leaders.\n\n\"We're hoping to get thousands of people out of college for a two-year stint — sort of make it, this is your service to the country as a technologist rather than as a soldier,\" Emil Michael, the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering and the agency's chief technology officer, said last week on the No Priors podcast, a tech show hosted by venture capitalists Sarah Guo and Elad Gil. Michael previously worked as Uber's chief business officer.\n\n\"We're going to try to make that a badge of honor,\" he added.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management, which is headed by former VC Scott Kupor, is coordinating the early-career program in partnership with other agencies, including the Department of Defense.

The ruling from U.S.",
    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”\n\nDuring the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”\n\n“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”\n\nIn his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.\n\n“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment\n\nDuring last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.\n\nAmong the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.\n\nBut in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.\n\nThe decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.\n\nAnother was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nDuring the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country's top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.\n\n“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”\n\nRamya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”\n\n“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",

    "description": "The 2025 college football season is now in the books, which means the final AP Poll of the year is out. Where did the Trojans come in?",
    "fullText": "On Monday night, Indiana defeated Miami to win its first ever national championship. With it, the 2025 college football season is now officially in the books.\n\nOn Tuesday, the final AP Poll of the season was released. USC came in at No. 20—four spots lower than where it ranked in the final regular season poll last month. The Trojans dropped their final game of the year, falling 30-27 to TCU in the Alamo Bowl.\n\nUSC was one of six Big Ten teams ranked in the final poll. The national champion Hoosiers were No. 1, followed by No. 4 Oregon and No. 5 Ohio State. In addition, Iowa was ranked No. 17 and Michigan No. 21.\n\nDoes it make sense to have USC three spots behind an Iowa team that the Trojans finished with the same record as and beat head-to-head? No. Is it worth complaining about at this point? Also no. Finishing a few spots higher in the final poll would not have meant much for USC in the scheme of things.\n\nNext season, USC is slated to face three of the top five teams from the final 2025 rankings. The Trojans will visit Indiana and host Ohio State and Oregon. It will certainly not be an easy road next year as USC enters what could be a make-or-break season for head coach Lincoln Riley.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: USC football ranked No. 20 in final AP Poll of season",

Social media users quickly caught onto the audio and praised the partnership.\n\nSO proud of you @Romeo!! Well deserved! 🥹❤️ #drpepper #goodandnice #drpepperjingle #nationalchampionshipgame #espn\n\n\"Dr Pepper, baby, it's good and nice,\" Bingham sang in a TikTok video posted December 23.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the post had over 44 million views and 50,000 comments from users and brands alike. Bingham's video gained traction on TikTok before the jingle was featured in a TV commercial, prompting some users to predict a collaboration was on the horizon.\n\n\"I am waiting for Dr Pepper to offer a massive contract,\" one commenter said on December 29.\n\n@Dr Pepper please get back to me with a proposition we can make thousands together. #drpepper #soda #beverage\n\nBingham and Dr Pepper did not reveal the terms of their deal and did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSeveral companies, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Panera Bread, and Hyundai, have also pounced on Bingham's comments and requested jingles for their brands.\n\nBingham created a song for Vita Coca, which the beverage brand posted on TikTok on January 16.\n\n@Romeo jingle stays on repeat #vitacoco #fyp #coconutwater #jingle #vitacocotreats\n\nThe partnership between Bingham and Dr Pepper appeared to be in the works for a few weeks leading up to the game, which ESPN reported attracted over 20 million viewers in 2025. On December 31, Dr Pepper commented under Bingham's video, telling them to check their DMs.\n\nSupport for Bingham has continued, with users sharing videos and comments congratulating them on the collaboration. Others have chimed in, saying they hoped Bingham got a good payday.\n\nI hope that girl who did the Dr. pepper jingle got paid very well.

    "description": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.",
    "fullText": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.\n\nThe device – which uses an approach called trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) - was cleared for use by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) to treat ADHD in 2019 based on a small study. These new findings from a larger multicentre trial, published in the journal Nature Medicine, suggest authorities should revisit the original evidence that supported the FDA clearance. Notably, TNS is currently not recommended for use in the UK by NICE guidelines.\n\nThe trial was run in collaboration with University of Southampton and funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Programme, a partnership between the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and the UKRI Medical Research Council (MRC), with further support from the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects five to eight per cent of school-age children worldwide and is associated with age-inappropriate problems with attention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that can impair everyday functioning. Stimulant medications improve symptoms in 70 per cent of those who take them in the short term but there is less evidence of their long-term effects.\n\nTo provide an alternative to medication researchers have developed and trialled approaches that use non-invasive stimulation of the brain, working on the regions that have been identified as influential in ADHD.\n\nOne of these approaches involves stimulating the trigeminal nerve (TNS), targeting a branch of this facial nerve which is thought to activate the brainstem and from there other brain regions that may be relevant to ADHD, in particular the locus coeruleus, which plays a role in arousal which is typically diminished in people with ADHD. TNS is thought to stimulate other brain regions associated with attention such as frontal and thalamic areas via the brainstem in a bottom-up manner.\n\nA previous small trial in the US with 62 children diagnosed with ADHD has shown that when TNS is applied every night for eight hours for one month it is effective in reducing symptoms – this research led to its clearance by the FDA for use in the US. However, the control condition involved no stimulation, and blinding was not tested after one month, raising questions about a potential placebo effect.\n\nThis new UK clinical trial across two sites in London and Southampton tested TNS in a wider range of 150 children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD aged between eight and 18 years old and applied a more rigorous placebo condition. Half of the sample received real TNS for about 9 hours every night for four weeks through battery-powered electrodes applied to the forehead. The other half of the sample received the ‘sham’ condition where electrodes were still applied to the forehead every night for four weeks but participants only received 30 seconds of stimulation every hour at a lower frequency and pulse width, which are thought to be non-effective and hence act as a “control” condition.\n\nOur study shows how important it is to design an appropriate placebo condition in clinical trials of brain therapies. There is a large placebo effect with high-tech brain therapies, in particular for patients and families that have an expectation that they can adjust brain differences associated with ADHD. It is hence paramount to control for placebo effects in modern brain therapies to avoid false hopes.\n\nDr Aldo Conti, postdoctoral researcher at IoPPN and at Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care, King’s College London and first author on the study said: “This multicentre trial was designed to address key limitations of the previous pilot study that informed FDA clearance of TNS for ADHD, particularly by using a rigorously controlled sham condition that supported successful blinding across the treatment period. Unlike the earlier study, which was limited to younger children, we also included adolescents, a clinically important group given well-documented challenges with long-term medication adherence. These design choices enabled a more robust and clinically relevant evaluation of TNS.”\n\nThe trial showed that TNS was safe with no serious adverse events and most participants considered it a mild or no burden to use. However, the results showed no significant change in ADHD symptoms, objective measures of hyperactivity, attention and associated behaviours around mood and sleep.\n\nProfessor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at University of Southampton and study lead for the Southampton site, stated: “Rigorous evidence, such as that generated by this study, is essential for supporting shared decision-making regarding interventions for ADHD. It empowers individuals with ADHD and their families to make informed choices about the treatment of ADHD. Clinicians, individuals with ADHD, and their families need to know which treatments work, and which do not based on the best evidence.”\n\nThe trial was run by the King’s Clinical Trials Unit and recruitment involved the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) clinics within the following NHS trusts: South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare (previously known as SOLENT NHS Trust), Central and North-West London NHS Foundation Trust, Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust and South-West London and St. George’s Mental Health NHS Trust.\n\nExternal trigeminal nerve stimulation in youth with ADHD: a randomized, sham-controlled, phase 2b trial by Conti, A.A. et al was published in Nature Medicine. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-04075-x\n\nProfessor of Cognitive Neuroscience\n\nPostdoctoral Research Associate",

    "fullText": "The Oklahoma Sooners closed the 2025 season with a loss in the College Football Playoff to the Alabama Crimson Tide, a team they beat earlier in the season in Tuscaloosa. And the AP voters punished them for it, dropping the Sooners from No. 8 in the College Football Playoff rankings to No. 13 in the final AP Poll for 2025.\n\nOklahoma fell behind Alabama, Notre Dame, BYU, and Texas. The Crimson Tide were dominated by national champion Indiana in the Rose Bowl. Notre Dame opted out of the Pop Tarts Bowl, and BYU and Texas won their respective exhibition non-playoff games.\n\nThe Sooners may have finished the season with a loss, but proved they were one of the 10 best teams in college football in 2025. Alabama being in front of Oklahoma is understandable. So is Texas, since they beat the Sooners in the Red River Showdown. But it doesn't make sense to drop Oklahoma behind Notre Dame or BYU.\n\nNotre Dame shouldn't get rewarded for opting out of a bowl game cause they were sad they missed the playoff. BYU was proven even more fraudulent by Texas Tech's shutout loss to the Oregon Ducks. The Cougars' only losses on the season came to the Red Raiders, and BYU lost in decisive fashion.\n\nIt's just more disrespect for a Sooners team that earned its way into the No. 8 seed of the College Football Playoff by rattling off road wins over Tennessee and Alabama before beating Missouri and LSU with dominant defensive performances.\n\nOklahoma's been aggressive this offseason to upgrade their offense and retool their defense, and now the AP has provided fuel for the fire to make a return trip to the College Football Playoff in 2026.\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions.

    "description": "Penn State could have a bounce-back season in 2026 and may be on the College Football Playoff bubble according to this early ranking from On3.",
    "fullText": "With the book officially closed on the 2025 college football season and a new national champion having been crowned, it is now time to shift our focus to the 2026 college football season. It's never too early for that, right? As is typically the case when the season comes to a close, the tradition of way-too-early top-25 projections are making the rounds already, and one of the more interesting teams to scout on these lists will be Penn State.\n\nFollowing a program-changing 2025 season with an in-season coaching change and the hiring of Matt Campbell to steer the ship back on course, and with a massive offseason roster overhaul as a result, Penn State may be a difficult team for many to accurately project in the 2026 season. But that will not stop anyone from attempting to gauge where the Nittany Lions will be sitting next season. If one way-too-early top-25 list from On3 is any indication, Penn State could be on the College Football Playoff bubble next fall.\n\nOn3 released its way-too-early top-25 list and gave Penn State a No. 14 projection. Putting Penn State somewhere in the middle of any top-25 projection feels somewhat fair given the changes wiht the program and puts some trust in Campbell to turn things around from Penn State's 2025 season. It also feels like a pretty safe projection to suggest Penn State could be in the playoff hunt but may fall just outside of it.\n\nOhio State tops the On3 top-25 outlook, followed by Georgia, Texas, and Notre Dame, respectively. 2025 national champion Indiana takes the No. 5 slot in the On3 way-too-early top-25, with Oregon right behind the Hoosiers to give the Big Ten three top-10 teams in this projection. Michigan is the only other Big Ten team ranked ahead of Penn State, at No. 11.\n\nOther Big Ten teams ranked in On3's early projection are Washington (No. 18), USC (No. 19), and Iowa (No. 21). Penn State will play road games next season at Michigan and Washington and will host USC. The Nittany Lions will not face Ohio State, Indiana, or Oregon during the regular season in 2026. Also of note, On3 also ranks Virginia Tech, now coached by former Penn State head coach James Franklin, at No. 23.\n\nFollow Kevin McGuire on Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.\n\nFollow Nittany Lions Wire on X, Facebook, and Threads.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: Where Penn State ranks in On3's way-too-early top 25 for 2026 season",

    "fullText": "Undefeated teams in college football history: Here's a list of every perfect national champion all time originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCollege football tends to thrive on chaos.\n\nUpsets are what makes the sport so captivating at times — when a smaller school topples a national power, it reminds fans what they enjoy so much about the landscape of NCAA football. But while upsets are fun, there are sometimes teams that are simply too dominant to overcome.\n\nCollege football has had its share of teams to go unbeaten across an entire season, some of which also claimed a win in that year's national championship. Some undefeated squads didn't get the opportunity to play for the title, while others steamrolled their way to college football glory, whether in the College Football Playoff, Bowl Championship Series or other previous playoff systems.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of the history of undefeated college football teams, including national champions.\n\nMORE: Which teams have the most wins in college football history?\n\nWith college football having a complicated history within its structure, there a few ways to view the history of undefeated teams — regardless of whether they won a national championship or not. In total, there have likely been hundreds teams to finish a college football season unbeaten, but with varying circumstances, tiebreaker and playoff rules and number of games.\n\nPre-1900, when college football was still free of ties and informal with plenty of differing rules, the NCAA has 26 teams on-record to finish their season unbeaten and untied, per the NCAA's 2009 Division I records report, which included any teams with a minimum of five games against opponents above the high school level. From 1900 to 1936, the year the AP Poll was introduced, there were an additional 133 teams to finish a season unbeaten and untied.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1991, the year before the Bowl Coalition was created — helping to better establish a national champion and provide better-quality bowl matchups — the NCAA has 134 teams on-record to finish a season unbeaten and untied.\n\nFrom 1992-2013, which spans between the Bowl Coalition, Bowl Alliance and Bowl Championship Series eras of the postseason, the NCAA has 40 teams on-record to go unbeaten and untied.\n\nHowever, in terms of comparing college football teams, it's easiest to assess the unbeaten teams in the College Football Playoff era, since 2014. Because this playoff format is still used by the NCAA, allows top teams to go head-to-head in the playoff, and limits the number of unbeaten squads, it's the easiest way to assess a \"perfect\" team in recent history.\n\nIn the CFP era, there have been seven FBS teams to go unbeaten in a full season, six of which won the CFP championship. A 13-0 USF team in 2017, which was not selected to the playoff bracket, is the lone non-champion.\n\nTrimming the parameters from 1994-2025, which largely covers the most modern era of college football, there have been a total of 30 FBS teams to go undefeated in a season. Nebraska had three (1994, 1995, 1997), while 11 of those 30 teams did not with the national championship, for varying reasons.\n\nOverall, the history of unbeaten teams is a complicated one, especially when looking at non-national champions. With the CFP in place, the era of multiple undefeated teams in one season is virtually obsolete, helping to quiet those complications. For years, there were consistently undefeated teams that didn't get a shot at the championship, including 1998 Tulane, 2004 Auburn, 2006 Boise State, 2008 Utah and 2010 TCU.\n\nExamining the history of undefeated teams to win the national championship is a bit more defined — while there have been many college football teams to finish a season unbeaten, especially in the early eras of the sport, a more select few have gone unbeaten with a title.\n\nMORE: Most losses in college football history by school\n\nSince 1936, the year the Associated Press released its first Top 25 poll, there have been 64 NCAA-recognized undefeated college football champions. That includes co-title holders.\n\nNotre Dame has six of those perfect championship seasons, while Nebraska and Alabama both have five.\n\nHere's the list of every undefeated national champion, separated by era (CFP, BCS, pre-BCS), according to the NCAA.\n\nMORE:What to know about college football overtime rules\n\nIn January of 2026, Indiana became the most recent undefeated college football team.\n\nPrior to Indiana, the last college football team to finish a season undefeated was the Michigan Wolverines in 2023. Led by head coach John Harbaugh and quarterback J.J. McCarthy, the Big Ten squad went 15-0 and won the College Football Playoff championship over Washington. Michigan's 2023 season resulted in controversy over a sign-stealing scandal, however.\n\nHarbaugh, in his ninth season at Michigan, guided his team to a 12-0 regular season in 2023. The Wolverines then beat Iowa 26-0 in the Big Ten Championship game and took down Alabama 27-20 in overtime of the Rose Bowl, a CFP semifinal game. To win the national title, Michigan beat Washington 34-13, winning the 12 title in program history and first since 1997.\n\nMichigan became the first national champion to have a lead at halftime in every game it played since 2001 Miami. Harbaugh's unit also became the first-ever Big Ten team to go 15-0. Outside of McCarthy, key contributors included guard Zak Zinte, running back Blake Corum, tight end Colston Loveland, defensive lineman Mason Graham and cornerbacks Mike Sainristil and Will Johnson.\n\nThere were a few reasons for controversy around Michigan's 2023 season, though. For one, Harbaugh had been suspended by his university for the first three games of the season due to alleged recruiting violations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, in November of the 2023 season, a sign-stealing scandal became apparent that gained national interests.\n\nIn October 2023, the NCAA began Michigan's football program amid allegations of sign-stealing, the Big Ten announced. The Wolverines were being accused of in-person scouting of future opponents. In early November, staffer Connor Stalions resigned due to his role in the schemes, while Harbaugh was suspended by the Big Ten for the team's final three regular-season games for violating sportsmanship rules.\n\nEventually, the NCAA's investigation officially found in 2025 that Michigan's football program had \"committed violations involving an off-campus, in-person scouting scheme.\" Through interview testimonies, ticket receipts and transfer data and other evidence, Stalions was found to have made scouting violations.\n\n\"During the 2021, 2022 and 2023 football seasons, Stalions directed and arranged for individuals to conduct off-campus, in-person scouting of Michigan's future regular-season opponents. In doing so, Stalions purchased game tickets and transferred them to those individuals, who included another staff member, interns and acquaintances of Stalions. The network of individuals was referred to as the 'KGB.' While in attendance, they filmed the signal callers on the future opponents' sidelines and then provided that film to Stalions,\" the NCAA's report said. \"Using the footage they collected — which Stalions referred to as 'dirty film' — Stalions then deciphered opponents' signals. Stalions and other individuals involved in the scheme acknowledged or corroborated this process.\n\nAdditionally, on one occasion, Stalions personally attended a future opponent's contest. In total, 56 instances of off-campus, in-person scouting of 13 future regular- season opponents occurred across 52 contests.\"\n\nThe NCAA's report also said that Stalions had spent nearly $35,000 on tickets in 2022 alone for the scheme. It also reported that Stalions, Harbaugh, Sherrone Moore and former director of player personnel Denard Robinson all failed to meet \"expectations of cooperation\" in the investigation, ranging from \"destroying relevant materials\" to \"providing false and misleading information during interviews.\"\n\nPunishments for the scandal were also released by the NCAA. Then-Michigan head coach, Sherrone Moore, was suspended three games, Stalions received an eight-year show-cause penalty, Harbaugh received a 10-year show-cause, and a fine was expected to eclipse $30 million for the school, per ESPN.\n\nRegardless of that investigation and the noise in made in the college football world, the Wolverines continued their dominance into the CFP and completed a perfect season. After the title win, Harbaugh left the program to be the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers in the NFL, not dealing with many of the consequences that were handed to the program from the sign-stealing scandal.\n\nMORE:Explaining the 2025 Sherrone Moore scandal at Michigan\n\nTwo teams have gone 16-0 in college football history: Indiana in 2025 and Yale in 1984. While Yale football team accomplished the feat. in 1984, thought, there are plenty of reasons to take that feat with a bit of an asterisk.\n\nThere wasn't just no CFP or no officially recognized national champions in 1894 — there was minimal padding for players and no helmets. It was a much different sport in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\nSince then, there have been a number of teams to go 15-0, but going 16-0 often hasn't been a possibility due to the length of the regular season, or the playoff format. If you count the FCS, there has been one other 16-0 team: North Dakota State in 2019.\n\nWith the creation of the 12-team CFP in 2024, it became possible for an FBS team to play 16 games between the regular season, their conference championship and the playoff bracket. In January 2026, the Indiana Hoosiers joined 1894 Yale as the only 16-0 teams in college football history.\n\nMORE: The full list of biggest blowouts in CFP history",

    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Carson Beck was part of two national championship runs at Georgia.\n\nTo him, those seasons weren't as good as this one was for him at Miami.\n\nBeck's last pass as a college quarterback was an interception, one that essentially sealed Miami's fate in a 27-21 loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff national championship game on Monday night. He had to watch the Hoosiers celebrate on what was his home field, watch the turf littered in crimson-and-white confetti.\n\nAnd yet, when he reflected on the end of his journey, he declared this year at Miami the best of his life.\n\n“Yeah, it was,” Beck said after a 19-for-32 passing, 232-yard, one-touchdown, one-interception performance in the final. “And not because we made the national championship, not because won a bunch of football games or we made great plays or things of that sort. Man, for me, my whole entire life changed.\n\n\"You know, 365 days ago, I was in just a really dark place, and I was trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It was a really difficult thing. There was just a lot going on, mentally, physically, emotionally, to be able to battle and fight through the roller-coaster that life is.\"\n\nAt this time a year ago, Beck was no longer wanted at Georgia, his elbow had just been surgically rebuilt, every move of his personal life became social-media fodder and he knew the doubters were everywhere.\n\nHe almost got the last laugh. Beck started all 16 games for Miami, led the Hurricanes to a 13-3 mark and set a school record by completing 72.4% of his passes. The last pass was a bit underthrown, and there seemed to be some sort of miscommunication on the final play. (“Their defense played really well tonight,\" Beck said.) But Miami knew long before that play that without Beck, they wouldn't have gotten anywhere near the CFP title game.\n\n“He earned the respect of his teammates, teammates working hard with him,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “We win together, we lose together. Proud of him.”\n\nBeck was at Miami for one year. He made clear after his final college game that whatever the future brings, he'll have the Hurricanes to thank.\n\n“I really couldn’t have done it without all these people around me,” Beck said. “This university truly saved me and helped me rebuild into the man that I am today.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS — The field was covered in red-and-white confetti, and the Heisman Trophy quarterback was covered in bruises. The college football season had just come down to the very final minute, and a team of perpetual sorrow was dancing toward glory.\n\nThis is what it looks like when reality surpasses fantasy.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana, emerging from a century of gloom, won the College Football Playoff national championship game, 27-21, against No. 10 Miami on Monday night in what feels like a seismic shift in possibilities for forgotten programs everywhere.\n\nWere they watching Monday night in Starkville, Mississippi?\n\nHow about in Ames, Iowa? Maybe even in the shadow of a new campus stadium in Tampa?\n\n“We’re 16-0 and national champions at Indiana University,” head coach Curt Cignetti said. “I know a lot of people thought that was never possible. It’s probably one of the greatest sports stories of all time.”\n\nThe Hoosiers, a team that had not won a conference championship in nearly 60 years and was more than 200 games below .500 before Cignetti arrived in 2024, went 16-0 and won the national championship just two years after going 3-9. If that kind of turnaround is possible in the new world of college football, can any dream be considered too outlandish in the days to come?\n\nQuarterback Fernando Mendoza, who grew up just miles from Hard Rock Stadium and was all but ignored by his beloved University of Miami as a Columbus High senior, played a virtually flawless game despite a fierce pass rush from the Hurricanes.\n\n“Tonight is going to be an insane night,” Mendoza said during the onfield trophy presentation. “I can’t wait to get back to Bloomington with the guys.”\n\nThere was nothing accidental about what Indiana accomplished this season. The record was perfect, and it was absolutely a reflection of the team’s play.\n\nThe Hoosiers were disciplined (fifth in the nation in penalties per game), they were explosive (second in points per game), they were stingy (second in points allowed per game) and they were smart (first in turnover margin).\n\nThey beat defending national champion Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game, and then crushed Alabama and Oregon by a combined 94-25 in their first two playoff games. All that stood in Indiana’s way was a Miami team that defied projections with upsets of higher-seeded teams in the first two rounds of the playoffs before dispatching Ole Miss in the semifinals.\n\nThe Hoosiers controlled the ball and frustrated the Hurricanes in the first half, and then came up with clutch plays on offense and special teams in the second half as Miami staged a furious comeback.\n\nAnd, in the end, Indiana’s fearlessness was the difference.\n\nAfter Miami had cut the lead to 17-14, the Hoosiers answered with a touchdown drive for the ages. It wasn’t that they held the ball for 12 plays or that they traveled 75 yards. It was that Cignetti put faith in his quarterback on a fourth and 5 instead of punting from the Miami 37, and then again on fourth down from the Miami 4. On the first conversion, Mendoza hit Charlie Becker on a 19-yard, back-shoulder completion. That was just the appetizer.\n\nOn fourth down from the 4, Indiana initially called the field-goal unit on the field. After a timeout, Cignetti sent the offense back out and Mendoza, on a quarterback draw, bounced off defenders and dove into the endzone for the touchdown.\n\n“They called that play and we knew, ‘Hey, we’re going to bet on ourselves one more time in the biggest (moment) of the game,’” Mendoza said.\n\nIn a way, this is what so many fans wanted. A college football postseason with the suspense of an NCAA basketball tournament.\n\nAlabama, Clemson, Georgia and Ohio State had become as ubiquitous in January as Dick Clark and Times Square. From 2014-22, there was not a single national championship game without at least one of those teams. And six of those games included some variation of two of those programs playing each other.\n\nThat’s the hierarchy the transfer portal torched. And this is the future that name, image and likeness money has begat.\n\nMiami, on Monday night, was playing in a national title game for the first time in 23 years. The last time Indiana had even a whiff of national title consideration was when the Hoosiers lost 14-3 to No. 1 USC in the 1968 Rose Bowl and finished No. 4 in the final Associated Press poll.\n\nIt’s a new era of college football.\n\nIt’s not perfect, by any means. It’s not beloved by traditionalists aghast with players jumping from school to school, and it’s practically blasphemous for programs accustomed to sitting atop the mountaintop.\n\nBut, as the 2025 season demonstrated, there is something exhilarating about the unknown. Something thrilling about new faces and stories.\n\nSomething remarkable about a program that could endure 26 losing seasons in 30 years and, with a new coach on board, emerge to go 27-2 across his first two seasons and win a national championship.\n\nWelcome to the new world order.\n\nJohn Romano can be reached at jromano@tampabay.com.

    "fullText": "Carson Beck will have plenty of fond memories to look back on from his college football career.\n\nBut it ended Monday in heartbreak.\n\nWith a chance to lead Miami on a drive for its sixth national championship, Beck threw an interception that sealed Indiana's first. His intended target on the play, Keelan Marion, never saw the ball in the air.\n\nWith the clock ticking under two minutes, Miami's defense held Indiana to a field goal that gave the Hoosiers a 27-21 lead. Beck then led the offense onto the field with 1:42 remaining, in need of a touchdown that could seal a national title on Miami's home field.\n\nMiami overcame a delay of game penalty before the first snap with a pair of first downs that put them over midfield. The first first down of the drive arrived courtesy of a roughing the passer penalty that resulted in the back of Beck's head hitting the turf.\n\nWith the Hurricanes facing first and 10 at the Indiana 41, Beck decided to go for it all with 51 seconds remaining. Marion ran a go route down the left sideline, facing man coverage from cornerback Jamari Sharpe and safety help over the top.\n\nBeck launched a deep ball that never stood a chance.\n\njamari sharpe game sealing interception; miami vs indiana pic.twitter.com/ceKYojVw14\n\n— ◇ (@F0RGIAT0) January 20, 2026\n\nThe ball was short and thrown into double coverage. Sharpe pinpointed it for an interception at the 15-yard line as Marion continued to run toward the end zone.\n\nWith Miami out of timeouts, all that was left for the Hoosiers to clinch the national championship was to run out the clock. They did just that for a 27-21 win.\n\nAnd Beck will finish his college career with two national championships as a backup at Georgia, but none as a starter.\n\nThe turnover was the first of the night for either team on a night when Beck completed 19 of 32 passes for 232 yards with 1 touchdown and the late interception.\n\nBeck was asked after the game how he was feeling on the last drive after the roughing-the-passer hit.\n\n\"My ears are ringing,\" Beck said, per ESPN's Pete Thamel.\n\nBeck also spoke with reporters about the game-sealing interception.\n\nHere’s Carson Beck explaining the final interception. pic.twitter.com/COIrwqYO4C\n\n— Clay Ferraro (@ClayWPLG) January 20, 2026\n\n\"The guy made a really good play,\" Beck said. \"They were in cover 2 and he sunk with no flat threat, made a really good play on the ball.\n\n\"So again, a lot of credit to them and their defense. They played really, really well tonight.\"\n\nPer Thamel, Marion was in tears in the postgame locker room with a towel over his head. He said that the interception was his \"mistake\" and that he didn't realize that Beck had thrown the pass.\n\n\"I didn't even know he had threw the ball,\" Marion said. ... “I got to look for the ball and make that play for him. So that's all on me.”\n\nHere's a look at the Marion's route from the sideline near the end zone. Marion didn't look back for the ball until he crossed the 20-yard line after Sharpe had made his break on the ball. By then, it was too late.\n\nI see what Carson Beck saw here. Why is Keelan Marion running with his head down? I really don’t understand. pic.twitter.com/XopqjBbpVp\n\n— Miami Hurricanes 2026 National Champs 🏆 (@nijayforeverlit) January 20, 2026\n\nThe interception concludes a college career for Beck that started at Georgia in 2020 and featured five seasons including a redshirt campaign with the Bulldogs before he utilized his extra Covid-19 season to transfer to Miami.\n\nMiami didn't win the ACC with Beck at quarterback, but was granted a controversial berth in the College Football Playoff. Beck and the Hurricanes ultimately proved the selection committee correct by winning three playoff games to advance to Monday's championship game.\n\nThey had a chance at the end to upset a historic Indiana team that surged to the top of college football with dominant units on both sides of the ball following decades of irrelevance.\n\nIt's a lot to be proud of. But it's not likely to soothe the pain of how Monday's championship game was lost at the end.",

Last year, Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl.\n\nMiami, where Monday's game will be played, is a particularly convenient location for Trump because he has a residence at Mar-a-Lago in nearby Fort Lauderdale. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago on Friday and stayed there through the weekend, but he is set to return to the White House after the game.\n\nTrump is expected to attend the game with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who graduated from law school at Miami and represented Florida in the U.S. senate before being nominated to join Trump's cabinet.",

There’s also a wealth of present-day interviews with Saban and his wife, the legendary Ms. Terry Saban, whose own influence and impact played a massive role in Nick’s success as a coach and leader.”\n\nSaban retired two years ago from Alabama and now serves as an ESPN analyst – as well as a pitchman for Aflac and Vrbo.\n\n“With my coaching days behind me, Ms. Terry and I have been doing a lot of reflection and realized we were ready to tell our story,” Nick Saban said. “The team at Words + Pictures has encouraged me to really look back not just at my time at Alabama, but every stop along the way – and not just reflect on what happened but consider the process which made it happen. I interacted with a lot of players and coaches along the way and I’m happy to see that so many of them have contributed to this docuseries. There’s a lot to tell, and I’m excited to share it all.”\n\nIn addition to his national titles, Saban’s football programs produced four Heisman Trophy winners and innumerable NFL stars. ESPN says the series will include “more than 30 hours of interviews with Saban, and more than 80 interviews with former players, assistant coaches, rivals, family, friends, and observers, the series offers a rare look at how he became the most successful and influential figure that the game of college football has ever known.”\n\n“There will never be another Nick Saban,” observed Connor Schell, CEO of Words + Pictures. “He’s a football genius, a singular leader, and a true icon who has done more than anyone to shape the modern game of college football and the culture around it. When you work with Coach Saban, you’re constantly reminded how every small detail matters and, in his case, that attention to detail and process has added up to an incredible journey and legacy. Working with Coach Saban and Ms. Terry has been a tremendous experience, and we can’t wait to share their story with the world.”\n\nESPN says the premiere date and full rollout plans for the series will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Grammys, Tonys & More",

    "fullText": "While college football is set to crown its national championship on Monday, Jan. 19 after Indiana's game against Miami, the race for men's college basketball's ultimate prize is heating up about two months before the start of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIn a week, the number of undefeated teams in the sport dwindled from five to three, with No. 2 Iowa State and No. 8 Vanderbilt both suffering two losses. The Cyclones were blown out 84-63 on the road by Kansas before following that up with a 79-70 setback at Cincinnati four days later. The Commodores, meanwhile, lost by 16 on the road against Texas and fell 98-94 at home to reigning national champion Florida.\n\nNo. 1 Arizona continued its perfect start to the season, moving to 18-0 with wins against rival Arizona State and at UCF. No. 10 Nebraska, the only other unbeaten team from a power conference, also kept its unblemished record intact, drubbing Oregon and Northwestern by a combined 54 points.\n\nREQUIRED READING: NCAA tournament bracketology: Race for No. 1 seed leads March Madness projection\n\nThen there's the nation's unlikeliest undefeated squad, Miami (Ohio), which moved to 19-0 thanks to a 105-102 overtime thriller over Buffalo.\n\nWill it be enough to get the RedHawks ranked? And how will results elsewhere in the country affect the newest batch of national rankings?\n\nHere's a look at the updated USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll and AP Top 25 for men's college basketball:\n\nFirst-place votes are in parentheses.\n\nOthers receiving votes: Iowa 52; Wisconsin 20; Miami (Ohio) 19; Utah State 14; Villanova 10; Tennessee 10; Saint Mary's 9; Miami (FL) 8; Texas A&M 5; Kentucky 5; SMU 4; Seton Hall 2; UCF 1; George Mason 1\n\nOthers receiving votes: Wisconsin 64; St. John's 64; Iowa 30; Kentucky 27; Tennessee 20; Utah State 15; UCF 14; Miami 10; George Mason 10; Saint Mary's 5; SMU 3; Villanova 3; Texas A&M 2; NC State 1\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Men's college basketball rankings: Updated Coaches Poll, AP Top 25",

    "fullText": "Way-Too-Early college football rankings for 2026: Indiana, Ohio State, Georgia out in front originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWay-Too-Early Top 25 lists do serve a purpose.\n\nWe get the same push-back every year. How could you possibly rank teams this early with NIL and the transfer portal increasing volatility from year to year in the 12-team College Football Playoff era?\n\nUseless? Nah. This is a useful exercise as a baseline for the 2026-27 college football season.\n\nIt's fun to take a swing at what next season might look like, too.\n\nWe had Penn State, Clemson and LSU in the top 10 on this list last season, and it didn't work out. So what? We also had five of the 10 P4 playoff teams, and two \n\nNo. 1 Indiana plays for the CFP championship on Monday against No. 10 Miami. We had the Hoosiers at No. 10 and Hurricanes at No. 20 in 2025, and it's hard to read both teams given the number of experienced players both teams will lose. It's as combustible as ever after the transfer portal quarterback shuffle, and Sporting News Way Too Early Top 25 reflects that.\n\nThere will be changes before August – and we anticipate this could get nuked by the end of September next season. Guess what? That is the fun part.\n\nMORE CFP CHAMPIONSHIP GAME NEWS:\n\nExpert prediction of Indiana-Miami final\n\nCurt Cignetti's past meets his future in semis\n\nRoster breakdown: Who has more blue-chippers?\n\nWhy Miami gets to keep all CFP revenue\n\nIs Indiana better than Joe Burrow-led LSU?\n\nMiami's run has a March Madness feel\n\nWhy would we doubt Curt Cignetti? The Hoosiers will have heavy losses to the 2026 NFL Draft – including potential No. 1 pick Fernando Mendoza – but Indiana will combine returners such as receiver Charlie Becker and defensive tackle Rolijah Hardy with another strong portal class. TCU quarterback Josh Hoover (3,472 yards, 29 TDs, 13 INTs), Boston College running back Turbo Richard (749 yards, 9 TDs), Michigan State receiver Nick Marsh (662 yards, 6 TDs) and Kansas State edge rusher Tobi Osunsanmi (4 sacks) lead the changes. Indiana had a top-25 recruiting class, too. Ohio State and USC visit Memorial Stadium this year.\n\nMORE: Curt Cignetti's past met its future during College Football Playoff\n\nOhio State coach Ryan Day still has yet to name a new offensive coordinator after Brian Hartline left for South Florida. Defensive coordinator Matt Patricia is back to run what will be a re-tooled defense led by defensive lineman Kenyatta Jackson Jr.  Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin (3,610 yards, 32 TDs, 8 INTs), running back Bo Jackson (1,090 yards, 6 TDs) and receiver Jeremiah Smith (1,243 yards, 12 TDs) return on offense. Five-star freshman Chris Henry Jr. also should make an instant impact. The schedule is high level with road trips to Texas, Iowa, USC and Indiana and home games against Oregon and Michigan.\n\nThe Bulldogs won back-to-back SEC championships under coach Kirby Smart – and quarterback Gunner Stockton returns after a solid first season as a starter. Tackle Monroe Freeling and linebacker CJ Allen declared for the NFL Draft, but running back Nate Frazier (947 yards, 6 TDs) and tackle Earnest Greene are back. Linebacker Raylen Wilson and safety KJ Bolden will be anchors for a solid defense. Road trips to Alabama (Oct. 10) and Ole Miss (Nov. 7) are the marquee games on the schedule.\n\nMORE: Transfer portal winners and losers\n\nArch Manning returns at quarterback, and so does the preseason hype. He will have a loaded group of receivers with Ryan Wingo, Emmett Mosley V and Auburn transfer Cam Coleman – who had 13 TD receptions the last two seasons. Arizona State transfer running back Raleek Brown (1,141 yards, 4) and NC State transfer back  offset Hollywood Smothers (939 yards, 6 TDs) the loss of leading rusher Tre Wisner. Will the Longhorns' offensive line be better? They nabbed Wake Forest's starting left tackle Melvin Siani just before the portal closed. Pitt linebacker Rasheem Biles and Florida State linebacker Justin Cryer add to the defense – which welcomes the return of defensive coordinator Will Muschamp. The Longhorns have a return home game against Ohio State (Sept. 12), and the SEC schedule does not offer many breaks.\n\nHow will the Irish respond to this year's playoff snub under coach Marcus Freeman, who is 43-12 since taking over as head coach? Quarterback CJ Carr – who had 2,751 yards, 24 TDs and six interceptions – is a Heisman Trophy contender. Running back Aneyas Williams and receivers Jaden Greathouse and Jordan Faison should work behind an experienced offensive line. Ohio State transfer wide receiver Quincy Porter is a nice addition. All-American cornerback Leonard Moore is back along with senior linebacker Drayk Bowen. Notre Dame opens with Wisconsin (Sept. 6) at Lambeau Field, and the home matchup with Miami (Nov. 7) will be huge.\n\nMORE: Marcus Freeman choosing ND shows college sports aren't doomed\n\nDante Moore (3,565 yards, 30 TDs, 10 INTs) returns at starting quarterback for the Ducks, and Nebraska transfer Dylan Raiola also is in the QB room. That's a fantastic start for coach Dan Lanning, who replaces coordinators Will Stein and Tosh Lupoi with Drew Mehringer and Chris Hampton. The defense added Minnesota safety Koi Perich – one of the most-exciting players in college football. The Ducks have settled in the Big Ten as an every-year contender, and the schedule features matchups against Ohio State, Michigan and USC.\n\nTexas Tech isn't done yet after making its first CFP appearance under Joey McGuire. The Red Raiders landed Cincinnati quarterback Brendan Sorsby – who had 2,800 passing yards, 28 TDs and seven interceptions. Auburn transfer Malcolm Simmons averaged 18.3 yards per catch. The defense loses impact players such as Jacob Rodriguez, David Bailey and Lee Hunter – so there is work to do to replicate that dominance from 2025. San Diego State edge rusher Trey White – who had 19.5 sacks the last two seasons – and Kansas State transfer Austin Romaine – who has 184 career tackles – should help.\n\nMORE: Brendan Sorsby tops SN's transfer portal QB rankings\n\nThe Hurricanes enjoyed the long-awaited break-through to a CFP championship game under Mario Cristobal, but there will likely be heavy losses from a veteran roster starting at quarterback with Carson Beck. Miami stole Darian Mensah away from Duke just before the CFP championship game. Receiver Malachi Toney and defensive tackle Justin Scott are back – but there will be some interesting roster decisions after the CFP championship game.\n\nCan Brent Venables get Oklahoma back to the College Football Playoff? Quarterback John Mateer, receiver Isaiah Sategna and leading tackler Kip Lewis are returning, but 26 players have entered the portal. Texas receiver Parker Livingstone is a solid pickup, and Michigan linebacker Cole Sullivan adds to a defense that also returns defensive tackle David Stone, Peyton Bowen and Eli Bowen. Oklahoma plays at Michigan (Sept. 12) and Georgia (Sept. 26) in the first month.\n\nHow will Pete Golding navigate his first full season as head coach? Dynamic quarterback Trinidad Chambliss is suing the NCAA to be eligible for another season. If Chambliss is denied, then Auburn transfer quarterback Deuce Knight would likely be the starter. Running back Kewan Lacy (1,567 yards, 24 TDs) is back, and the Rebels did not have a massive exodus in the portal. LSU visits Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on Sept. 19 in Lane Kiffin's return.\n\nThe Cougars are 23-4 the last two seasons. Quarterback Bear Bachmeier and Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year LJ Martin are back from a team that was on the cusp of the College Football Playoff, but the Cougars will have to replace receiver Chase Roberts and BYU added four tackles – including USC's Walker Lyons – via the transfer portal. Linebacker Isaiah Glasker and safety Faleatu Satuala are the key returners on defense. Utah and Notre Dame are the marquee games on the schedule.\n\nThis will be a telling third year for Kalen DeBoer. Ty Simpson declared for the NFL Draft, meaning the quarterback competition between Austin Mack and Keelon Russell is front and center. The Crimson Tide have 20 players who left via the transfer portal, and running back Daniel Hill and receiver Ryan Williams are key returners – but the offense line will need to be rebuilt again. Safety Brady Hubbard is back on defense. Early-season home games against Florida State (Sept. 19) and Georgia (Oct. 10) will be a good gauge for where the Crimson Tide stand.\n\nThird-year coach Mike Elko can build off a CFP appearance. Quarterback Marcel Reed ranked fifth in the SEC with 3,169 passing yards. Reuben Owens III returns and will take on a lead role at running back, and Alabama transfer receiver Isaiah Horton is a key addition. The defense will have to replace the production from All-American Cashius Howell – and the schedule is tougher this time with road trips to LSU (Sept. 26), Alabama (Oct. 24) and Oklahoma (Nov. 24) before the home finale against Texas (Nov. 27).\n\nThe Trojans are 16-10 since joining the Big Ten, and this is another prove-it year for Lincoln Riley. Quarterback Jayden Maiava returns. He ranked fourth in the FBS with 3,711 passing yards. The Trojans also brought in the top recruiting class in the country. Defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn left for Penn State, however, and the Trojans lost 20 players in the transfer portal. Trips to Indiana and Penn State and home games against Ohio State and Oregon are the highlights.\n\nMorgan Scalley takes over for longtime coach Kyle Whittingham, and the Utes should be right back in the mix in the Big 12 race. Quarterbacks Devin Damper and Byrd Ficklin both return, and leading rusher Wayshawn Parker (981 yards, 6 TDs) is back. Safety Tao Johnson is a top returner on defense. Utah closed the season with six straight victories and averaged 46.5 points per game. Will that momentum carrry over with Scalley?\n\nWhittingham takes over at Michigan after Sherrone Moore was fired. New offensive coordinator Jason Beck will get to work with quarterback Bryce Underwood, who had 2,418 yards, 11 TDs and nine interceptions as a freshman. Jordan Marshall and five-star freshman Savion Hiter from a strong backfield, and Texas transfer Jamie Ffrench adds to the receiver room. Utah edge rusher John Henry Daley – who had 11.5 sacks – is a portal prize. The Wolverines play Oklahoma on Sept. 12 and face Indiana, Oregon and Ohio State in Big Ten play.\n\nHow will Lane Kiffin fare in Year 1 at LSU? The “Portal King” reeled in Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt and nine receivers via the transfer portal. Running back Caden Durham also is back. Linebacker Whit Weeks returns to what should be a healthier defense, and Boise State safety Ty Benefield will be a star in this defense.  September features the home opener at Clemson (Sept. 5), Kiffin's return to Ole Miss (Sept. 19) and a home game against Texas A&M (Sept. 26).\n\nPenn State hired Matt Campbell, and 22 players from Iowa State followed him to Happy Valley, including veteran quarterback Rocco Becht (2,584 yards, 16 TDs, 9 INTs). It's an overhaul at almost every position, and the running back room features Iowa State's Carson Hansen and Ohio State transfer James Peoples. We trust Campbell, but this feels like a transition season despite a friendly schedule that does not include Indiana, Ohio State or Oregon.\n\nThis could be Jeff Brohm's best team if Ohio State transfer Lincoln Kienholz takes command of the starting quarterback job. Running backs Isaac Brown (884 yards, 7 TDs) and Keyjuan Brown (704 yards, 6 TDs) are back, and edge rusher Clev Lubin (8.5 sacks, 13.5 TFLs) also returns. Brohm has 27 players coming in via the portal, including Vanderbilt receiver Tre Richardson (806 yards, 7 TDs). The Cardinals have a showcase opener against Ole Miss (Sept. 5) at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nIowa is in its customary spot under long-time coach Kirk Ferentz in these rankings. Wake Forest transfer Jeremy Hecklinski and Hank Brown will battle for the starting QB job. Kamari Moulton returns at running back, and Kade Pieper will anchor the offensive line. Zach Lutmer (71 tackles, 3 INTs) leads the defense. Iowa State, Ohio State, Nebraska and Wisconsin all visit Kinnick Stadium. The Hawkeyes have finished between No. 16 and No. 25 six of the last eight seasons.\n\nThe Cougars are a legit Big 12 sleeper contender under coach Willie Fritz. Quarterback Conner Weigman, Oregon transfer running back Makhi Hughes and receiver Amare Thomas – who had 966 yards and 12 TDs – lead the offense. Five-star quarterback Keisean Henderson could get opportunities too. Tulane guard Shadre Hurst – a second-team SN All-America pick – beefs up the offensive line. The defense has to replace its top two tacklers. A road trip to Texas Tech could be the best game on the Big 12 schedule.\n\nThe Illini are 19-7 the last two seasons under Bret Bielema. Luke Altmyer is gone, and East Carolina transfer Katin Houser is a solid replacement. A supporting cast of running back Caa'Lil Valentine (614 yards, 4 TDs) and receivers Collin Dixon (548 yards, 5 TDs) and Hudson Clement (454 yards, 3 TDs) is back. The defense will have to replace the production left by edge rusher Gabe Jacas. Illinois faces Duke (Sept. 12) early, and the Big Ten schedule features matchups against Oregon and at Ohio State.\n\nSMU is 20-7 with a CFP appearance under Rhett Lashlee since joining the ACC. Quarterback Kevin Jennings returns for his senior season. The Mustangs picked up East Carolina receiver Yanick Smith (583 yards, 5 TDs) via the portal. SMU plays at Notre Dame, and the conference schedule is favorable outside of a trip to Louisville. The Mustangs will be right back in the ACC championship hunt.\n\nDemond Williams (3,065 passing yards, 25 TDs, 8 INTs) is returning at quarterback for Washington after a brief interlude with LSU. He also had 611 rushing yards and six TDs. Oregon running back Jayden Limar is a portal find who replaces Adam Mohamed, who transferred to Cal. Coach Jedd Fisch reeled in a top-10 recruiting class, too. Washington has home games with Indiana and Penn State and road tests at Oregon and USC.\n\nWill Eddie Robinson Coach of the year Clark Lea capitalize on the momentum created by Diego Pavia and All-American tight end Eli Stowers in 2025? Five-star freshman quarterback Jared Curtis is up next, and the Commodores added 16 players via the transfer portal. Clemson safety Ricardo Jones joins CJ Heard in the secondary, and linebacker Bryan Longwell – who has 70 tackles – also returns. The Commodores won't surprise anybody this year – and the matchups with Georgia (Oct. 3) and Alabama (Nov. 14) will tell the tale.\n\nManny Diaz led the Blue Devils to an ACC championship this season, but losing Mensah is a huge blow, especially with backup Henry Belin IV also gone. Running back Nate Sheppard – who had 1,132 yards and 11 TDs – also returns. Duke added 14 players via the transfer portal. The Blue Devils should be one of the best offenses in the ACC, and an early-season game at Illinois (Sept. 12) is a good barometer for success.\n\nDo you believe James Franklin can guide a quick turn-around at Virginia Tech? He flipped several Nittany Lions' recruits and brought 12 Penn State players from the transfer portal, and that includes quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer. This might be a year early, especially with a schedule that includes road trips to Clemson, SMU and Miami.",

    "fullText": "Miami will be playing for a national championship on its home field Monday night as it squares off against the Indiana Hoosiers in Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nThe Hurricanes are one of the most dominant college football programs of the last 50 years, and they are looking to add their sixth national title in this game. However, to an entire generation of college football fans, Miami's appearance in a CFP title game is anything but typical.\n\nThe national title drought for the Hurricanes has lasted 24 years, as they last claimed a trophy during the 2001 season. Miami hasn't even played for a national title since the 2002 season — in which it lost to Ohio State in overtime on a now-infamous pass interference penalty.\n\nThe decades since have not been kind to the Hurricanes. They won 11 games the following year in 2003, but that was the last double-digit win total until a 10-win season under Mark Richt in 2017. After that, the 'Canes didn't reach double-digit wins again until 2024 under Mario Cristobal, who has now won 23 games over the last two campaigns.\n\nMiami football is inarguably \"back,\" and a win over the Hoosiers to claim its sixth national championship would only further solidify that fact.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: When was Miami football's last national championship appearance?",

On Monday night, millions will watch the crimson of the Hoosiers clash with the all-white Hurricanes.\n\nAlthough the game is played at Miami's home turf, Hard Rock Stadium, the Hurricanes are technically the away team.\n\nThere are many significant storylines entering this game, but none more unique than the fact that this year's National Championship game will mark the first time in history that both schools are Adidas-branded.\n\nThis year's national championship is the first all-Adidas matchup in the title game.\n\nIt will be the first Adidas branded team to win a national title since Tennessee in 1998. pic.twitter.com/hnq9di2V4r\n\n— The Next Round (@NextRoundLive) January 13, 2026\n\nNo matter the outcome, this will be the first Adidas-branded school to win a national title since 1998, when the Tennessee Volunteers won it all.\n\nThe Sporting News has all you need to know about Indiana and Miami's uniform threads for the 2026 CFP National Championship game.\n\nMORE CFP CHAMPIONSHIP GAME NEWS:\n\nExpert prediction of Indiana-Miami final\n\nCurt Cignetti's past meets his future in semis\n\nRoster breakdown: Who has more blue-chippers?\n\nIs Indiana better than Joe Burrow-led LSU?\n\nMiami's run has a March Madness feel\n\nWhile the Hoosiers team and fanbase will have to travel to Miami, they have been deemed the home team.

Indiana has not been defeated this season while wearing these uniforms; in fact, they haven't lost a game in any uniform.\n\nThe first edition of the Adidas uniforms dates back to 2004, though many tweaks have been made over the last 22 years. In 2024, Indiana extended their partnership with Adidas, which will run until 2034.\n\nIt might be confusing, but even though the Hurricanes will be playing at home, they have been designated the away team.

The significance of this for those who are superstitious, Miami has not lost a game this season in these uniforms. In fact, they are 5-0 on the season and wore the same all-whites in their playoff wins over Texas A&M and Ohio State.\n\nDespite this being an \"away\" game, it will feel anything but that for the Hurricanes. The university put out a statement to those planning on attending, encouraging the Hurricanes faithful to wear orange.\n\nThis will undoubtedly produce a striking contrast with the all-white uniforms on the field.",

    "description": "Eryn Bostwick said that her high student-loan payments have prevented her from moving forward with IVF treatment.",
    "fullText": "College was always the goal for Eryn Bostwick.\n\nAs a first-generation college student, Bostwick, 37, said her parents wanted to ensure she had the opportunities they didn't have, and they believed that earning a college degree would provide her with financial stability.\n\nBostwick's parents weren't wrong — data show that a four-year college degree leads to higher earnings than a high school diploma. However, to accomplish that goal, Bostwick had to take out student loans and Pell grants. She said she wasn't fully aware of the long-term ramifications of the debt.\n\nShe now has just over $55,000 in student loan debt, which she accrued while pursuing a bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. at public universities with the goal of becoming a college professor. As a result, she's put off major life decisions, like adding to her family.\n\n\"I've always been very careful about when I would feel comfortable bringing a child into this world,\" Bostwick told Business Insider.\n\nIn vitro fertilization, or IVF, was the only way Bostwick could have a child due to existing medical conditions. While Bostwick and her husband were able to afford the initial rounds of treatments, Bostwick left her full-time job in Texas to move back to Ohio to be closer to family, and she was unable to find a job that paid enough to cover IVF, student-loan payments, and her other expenses.\n\nShe now works as a part-time teacher at two different colleges, with an income in the low five figures.\n\n\"Could we go through IVF? Sure, but then we wouldn't be able to afford actually having a child,\" Bostwick said. \"It just felt like there's too much hanging over our heads.\"\n\nMany student-loan borrowers have told Business Insider that they've had to put off major life decisions, like having children, retiring, or purchasing a home, due to their high debt loads. The year ahead could bring even more financial strain to borrowers — President Donald Trump's Education Department will begin implementing a repayment overhaul in July, which includes new repayment plans with higher monthly payments.\n\nThe uncertainty of what's to come in the student-loan industry has borrowers like Bostwick wary of making major life decisions that could become significant financial burdens.\n\n\"It feels like any power was taken from me, all because of a decision I made when I was 18 years old that I didn't completely comprehend, that my parents didn't completely comprehend, that I felt was necessary in order to create this better life for myself,\" Bostwick said. \"And now it's really just become a noose around my neck.\"\n\nBostwick said she has 71 qualifying payments toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years, or 120 qualifying payments.\n\nHowever, she is also enrolled in the SAVE plan, created by former President Joe Biden and intended to provide borrowers with cheaper monthly payments and a shorter timeline to debt relief. Borrowers on the plan have been in forbearance since July 2024 due to litigation, meaning that PSLF borrowers have not been receiving credit toward forgiveness during that period.\n\nAdditionally, Trump's administration announced a proposed settlement to eliminate the plan. If a court approves the settlement, SAVE borrowers would have a limited time to enroll in a new income-driven repayment plan with higher payments.\n\n\"The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement alongside the announcement of the proposed settlement.\n\nIt's not that simple, Bostwick said. Many of the students she teaches are first-generation, like herself, and they pursued higher education because they were told it's the best way to achieve upward mobility and financial stability. Given her experience with student debt, Bostwick said she \"makes it her mission\" to ensure her students are aware of the implications of taking out loans, and that a degree isn't always necessary to pursue certain career paths.\n\n\"I've never once heard somebody say they don't want to be able to take out loans and never pay them back,\" Bostwick said. \"They want to be able to pay their loans back, but the current system makes it nearly impossible.\"\n\nTrump's Department of Education said it's working to improve the system. It just concluded negotiations on proposals aimed at preventing borrowers from taking out unaffordable debt, and it has previously said that its changes to repayment are aimed at reducing complexity in the student-loan industry.\n\nBostwick said she isn't getting her hopes up.\n\n\"I just feel like I've constantly been trying to keep my head above the water, and it's never really been good enough,\" she said. \"It's unbelievably frustrating.\"\n\nHave a story to share?

    "fullText": "The Miami Hurricanes head into the College Football Playoff national championship game with some pretty good news on the injury front. Elija Lofton has been ruled out, and Damari Brown appears to be trending towards a game time decision, but every other contributor avoided being on the availability report and appears good to go, including Ahmad Moten, Sr., Akheem Mesidor, and OJ Frederique.\n\nHowever, thanks to college football’s own controversial rule, the Hurricanes’ defense will still have to try to hold the Indiana Hoosiers in check without one of their most important players – starting cornerback Xavier Lucas.\n\nLucas was flagged for targeting in the second half of Miami’s 31-27 win over Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl. He hit Ole Miss WR Cayden Lee with his shoulder, but the contact occurred to Lee’s head, and Lucas was sent to the showers.\n\nIt’s not being talked about enough how ridiculous it is that Xavier Lucas has to sit out the first half of the title game because he tried to tackle the lower body of a receiver being led into him by his QB as the WR twisted his body down into his helmet.pic.twitter.com/oT3F5l3lnr\n\n— David Furones (@DavidFurones_) January 16, 2026\n\nBased on the NCAA’s rule, Lucas is suspended for the first half of Monday night’s clash with the Indiana Hoosiers. It feels like a heavy and unfair penalty because it is, particularly given it wasn’t an intentional and egregious hit. At some point as a defender, you have to commit to going into a hit, and a wide receiver’s body position changes in a millisecond, and some guys just miss. This was an example of exactly that. Now, as a result of playing football, Lucas will be watching with his helmet in his hand for the first 30 minutes.\n\nMario Cristobal was asked about the hit on Sunday morning at his joint press conference with Indiana’s Curt Cignetti, and he feels as though the rule should be revisited.\n\n“Certainly do. We feel it was unjustly administered, and now it impacts the last game of the season. We do have the ability, again, as an officiating crew and the powers that be to revisit that to give every team due process and their best ability to compete in this game.“\n\nIndiana’s offense is a handful, with Omar Cooper, Jr. Elijah Sarratt, and Charlie Becker forming a terrific trio of pass catchers. Miami is being severely hamstrung by this rule. Hopefully for Miami’s sakes, they can continue to control the game on offense early on with long, sustained drives and keep Indiana’s offense on the sideline.\n\nBecause if they don’t, an already extremely tough offense will be even tougher for the Hurricanes to stop. And on the game’s biggest stage, that’s a real shame.",

    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Robina Aminian's family believes the college student was killed by a bullet fired by Iranian security forces straight into the back of her head.\n\nBut her death in the nationwide protests that challenged the Islamic Republic's theocracy was only the start of the family's agony. In the aftermath of the killing, Aminian's mother had to look through piles of bloodied corpses to find her daughter's body. Then the family raced to escape authorities who might demand payment to release the body and buried her hastily in an unmarked roadside pit.\n\nTheir odyssey reflects the trail of anguish left by Iran's deadly assault on protesters, which has led to desperate relatives searching overflowing morgues across the country. For families, the loss of loved ones is compounded by the difficulty they face in grieving and giving the dead a dignified sendoff.\n\nMore than a week after she was killed, Aminian's relatives say they still have not held a funeral for the young Kurdish woman who was studying fashion in Tehran, the capital.\n\n“She wanted a bright future for herself,” her uncle, Nezar Minoei, said from Oslo. “But unfortunately, the future has been stolen from her.”\n\nDetails about what happened to Aminian are scant. After her death, her mother called relatives outside the country, recounting what she learned from Aminian's friends, who were present when she was killed.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke to three relatives, who all described similar details from the mother's account. An Oslo-based human rights organization, Iran Human Rights, released a report about her killing, citing witness testimony. They verified there was a shooting on the night of Jan. 8 around the campus of the Shariati Technical and Vocational College for Girls.\n\nWith communications greatly limited in Iran, the AP has been unable to independently confirm the family’s account or the wounds to Aminian’s body or to verify its location. The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York has declined to comment.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which relies on a network of activists on the ground and has been accurate during previous unrest in Iran, said at least 3,090 people have been killed. Iran's government has not offered any overall casualties figures.\n\nEverything that Aminian's relatives abroad know about her death comes from a brief phone call her mother was able to make Jan. 10 to relatives in Oslo.\n\nThey say the mother, Amina Norei, got a call Jan. 8 from Aminian’s friends, who said she had been gunned down by security forces. The friends told Norei they were walking away from campus in Tehran after dark when they saw a protest and joined in.\n\nA bullet fired by security forces struck the back of Aminian’s head, her friends told the mother.\n\nVideos shared on social media, verified by the AP, and statements by rights groups, doctors and survivors, describe Iranian agents using rifles and shotguns to disperse protesters across the country.\n\nIran's theocracy, which has used violence in previous rounds of unrest, increasingly refers to demonstrators as “terrorists.\" Authorities allege some demonstrators were armed, but there are no allegations that anyone was armed in Aminian's vicinity at the time of her death.\n\nAminian’s relatives said she was not an activist or involved in politics.\n\nAminian's mother was in Kermanshah, a western city in the Kurdish region of Iran nearly 460 kilometers (230 miles) from Tehran, when she learned about her daughter's death.\n\nShe rushed to Tehran in the middle of the night, she told family. Norei recalled to them how she began unzipping body bag after body bag, looking for Aminian.\n\n“She looked through so many beautiful faces, trying to find her girl,\" Hali Norei, Amnian's aunt, said from Oslo. ”And what is so horrifying for me is imagining what my sister feels as she searches for her daughter.\"\n\nMany other Iranian families are searching overflowing morgues for loved ones, according to rights group Amnesty International. Bodies have piled up in trucks, freight containers and warehouses, the group said.\n\nWhen Norei found her daughter, she was joined by her husband, daughter and son, and the family rushed out with the body, fearing authorities would block their way and insist on a payment to release the corpse, according to Minoei, Aminian’s uncle.\n\n“She actually stole the body,” Minoei said.\n\nIn a statement to the AP, the New York City-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said it has received multiple accounts of intelligence forces demanding money from families in exchange for the return of protesters' bodies. The group called the levies “a well-known, standard practice” in Iran to scare families into not publicly mourning their dead.\n\nOther families reported to the center that they were forced to sign papers falsely declaring that their dead relatives were members of the security forces in order to retrieve the bodies.\n\nIranian state television recently aired a statement saying mortuary and burial services were free, after repeated allegations of the practice.\n\nMinoei said the mother told him that she and her oldest daughter spent the seven-hour ride back to Kermanshah clutching the body in the backseat, blood and tears staining their clothes. When they got home, the mother told him, security forces had surrounded their house.\n\nAmina Norei told her family they had only one option: They drove out of town and dug a pit on the side of the road. They placed the body inside and drove away. Aminian is still believed to be buried there, in an unmarked grave.\n\nRelatives said they have not heard from Amina Norei or other relatives in Iran since Sunday.\n\nJulia Frankel reported from Jerusalem.",

    "fullText": "As we hit the heart of the college basketball season, I’ll be bringing you a moneyline parlay every Saturday for what’s always a stacked slate of NCAA hoops action.\n\nToday, I’m backing undefeated Nebraska, an SMU squad that remains perfect at home, and Arkansas on the road.\n\nBest of all, this parlay has been BOOSTED by our friends at bet365! Here are my college basketball picks for January 17!\n\nTime: 4:00 p.m. ET\nLocation: Evanston, IL\nTV: Big Ten Network\nPick: Nebraska (-245)\n\nThe 17-0 Nebraska Cornhuskers are one of just three unbeaten teams left in college hoops. The Huskers have beaten quality competition, owning five wins over Top-40 KenPom teams — including victories against No. 12 Michigan State and No. 5 Illinois.\n\nThey won’t go undefeated forever, but a Northwestern Wildcats team that has lost eight straight games against high-major opponents isn’t likely to be the one to trip them up.\n\nTime: 12:00 p.m. ET\nLocation: Dallas, TX\nTV: ESPN2\nPick: SMU (+120)\n\nThis sets up as a potential letdown and lookahead spot for the Virginia Cavaliers, who are coming off a big road win at Louisville and have a week off after this game. The Hoos rely heavily on the 3-point shot, which doesn’t always travel well.\n\nMeanwhile, the SMU Mustangs are a perfect 11-0 at home, most recently beating Virginia Tech on a last-second half-court shot Wednesday. SMU boasts elite guard play and held its own on the road at Duke last week despite missing star guard Boopie Miller (20.8 ppg, 7.1 apg).\n\nBack at home with Miller in the lineup, the Mustangs should be in a strong position to get the job done against UVA.\n\nTime: 4:00 p.m. ET\nLocation: Athens, GA\nTV: ESPN2\nPick: Arkansas (+105)\n\nThe No. 21-ranked Georgia Bulldogs have been an offensive juggernaut, leading the nation at 96.4 points per game. That said, I’m not sold on Georgia’s resume, as the Bulldogs rank 116th in strength of schedule and are 0-2 in Quad 1 games.\n\nMeanwhile, the No. 17 Arkansas Razorbacks have faced the 27th-toughest schedule and are 3-4 in Quad 1 contests. Arkansas also boasts the more talented roster and the coaching edge with John Calipari on the sideline.\n\nThat’s enough for me to back the Razorbacks as short road dogs.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

That all starts on Saturday, as Jake Diebler’s Buckeyes welcome Mick Cronin’s UCLA Bruins (12-5, 4-2) to Columbus.\n\nBoth Ohio State and UCLA have feasted on the bottom of the Big Ten so far this year, with neither team beating a fellow Big Ten team that’s in the top half of the conference standings. For Ohio State, Saturday’s game is a Quad-2 opportunity, for UCLA, it’s a Quad-1 game.\n\nOhio State will be without senior forward Brandon Noel, while senior center Christoph Tilly will likely be listed as questionable after being treated for a head injury suffered last weekend at Washington. Ohio State’s newest player, former Penn State forward Puff Johnson, may be on the bench Saturday, but is not expected to suit up one day after being ruled eligible by a court in Franklin County.\n\nFollowing Saturday’s game, Ohio state will face Minnesota at home, Michigan on the road, and Penn State at home.\n\nUCLA will likely be without guard Skyy Clark, who averages 13.5 points per game and is sooting 48.6% from three this season, as he recovers from a hamstring injury.\n\nConnect with Connor: \nTwitter: @lemons_connor",

    "fullText": "Josh Pate declares whether Big Ten has overtaken SEC in college football moving forward originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf it were up to college football podcaster and analyst Josh Pate, the Big Ten-SEC debate as to which conference holds the cards isn't even close.\n\nPate said on a recent edition of \"Josh Pate's College Football Show\" that the Big Ten deserves the same respect, if not more, than the SEC in this current era of college football.\n\n“The SEC is lagging behind the Big Ten, at the top,\" Pate said. \"I would even venture to suggest the middle-tier now is at least comparable if not slightly lagging behind. That’s probably where my perception has changed of late, moreso than at the top. So I’m not beating that drum.”\n\nPate made an interesting follow-up point: it doesn't even matter that the Indiana Hoosiers are currently the class of the league. It's the psychological framework about what makes those players more polished than those from the SEC. And it's greater than just mental and physical toughness, Pate said.\n\nMore: Todd McShay passionately defends Dante Moore's decision to return to Oregon Ducks\n\n“Maybe the average Big Ten player is wired a little bit differently, maybe they focus a little more on the football aspect, the mean-and-potatoes aspect of football, instead of the more highlight-ish, branding aspect of football,” Pate said.\n\nThat \"wired\" approach is the most unique part. It can't be taught. It can't be studied.\n\n“If you think that’s ridiculous, it’s because it is,” Pate said. “But that’s been standard practice in the SEC for awhile. And I don’t find it to be the case in the Big Ten.”\n\nMore: Inside the special moment Indiana's Curt Cignetti will never forget\n\nWhether the narrative returns in favor of the SEC is unclear, but right now, the Big Ten can keep chasing excellence.\n\nEntering Monday night's game, a potential Hoosiers victory over the Miami Hurricanes may further validate Pate's argument while the SEC watches from the sidelines.\n\nWhat Dylan Raiola's commitment to Oregon Ducks signals for Dante Moore's NFL future\n\nCollege football analyst bashes SEC in defense of Big Ten as Indiana clinches title berth\n\nTodd McShay shares massive advice for Oregon QB Dante Moore on heels of NFL Draft decision\n\nIndiana QB Fernando Mendoza gets massive kudos from ex-NFL coach with interesting pro comp",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

    "fullText": "College stars in America have been having a gala time since Name, Image, and Likeness rights came into effect. It allows them to capitalize on their popularity financially, something superstars of the past, including Michael Jordan and LeBron James, were not able to do at the collegiate level. But, as with most things, the change has also had a negative impact on the sport, according to Paul Pierce for one.\n\nThe NBA legend feels that basketball in college has become far less competitive. The drive to get to the top, not just because they’re succeeding professionally, but also monetarily, seems to have gone.\n\nPierce feels budding talents in the NBA have become complacent, because from what they earn in college, they can easily take care of their families. The question is, could this affect the quality of the NBA in the future?\n\nThe ex-Boston Celticsman acknowledged that the NBA is not in trouble just yet. “This year, it’s a great class,” he said on Derrick White‘s podcast. “I think there’s some ballers out there in college. They look good…”\n\n*“But then, you look at some [and] it’s like damn, they don’t even care once they got that money now. You see certain players in high school that get to college now and you go like, what happened?”*\n\nWhite, adding on to what Pierce said, opined that the issue stems from kids growing up poor and suddenly having too much money in their hands in college. Before, it was about getting to the NBA to get that big paycheck. Now, if they do well in college, it’s not a necessity anymore.\n\nAnother problem that White pointed out was players jumping ship when they don’t like their stay in a particular college. “I don’t think the teams are as connected, like, in that culture. Now, I think it’s just random because, like transfer portal and all this is just going on.”\n\n“I think, money has something to do with it, but just, I think the culture is a little bit different now,” White concluded.\n\nPlayers who dream of making money would undoubtedly not care where they get it from. If college ball keeps them and their families relatively comfortable for the time being, its normal for most to take their foot off the pedal for a bit.\n\nPierce brought up a great point, describing how players like Stephen Curry, who did not grow up poor, still had that relentless drive to become a legend. He didn’t have NIL. But he had his father Dell Curry, a former NBA star, to back him. On the other hand, there were those like Ben Simmons, who were projected to be great, but earned their millions, and called it a day.\n\nBottom line, it depends on the mindset. Yes, NIL does influence certain things. But someone with a Curry-esque, or James-esque mentality, would never put their feet up in college.\n\nThe post “They Don’t Even Care”: Paul Pierce Questions if Money Is Ruining College Basketball appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Five days ago, Lane Kiffin and the LSU Tigers had zero quarterbacks. Now they have three intriguing players and one of the best rooms in college football.",
    "fullText": "Just last week, the LSU Tigers had no scholarship quarterbacks on the roster and fans started to freak out. Now, they have assembled one of the strongest rooms in the nation, with as clear a plan for the future as the transfer portal era allows.\n\nAfter picking up their third commit on Wednesday morning, Lane Kiffin is likely done configuring his group. Here is how the quarterback room will look for the 2026 season:\n\nAfter nearly two weeks of searching, meeting and striking out with a couple of options, the Tigers ended up landing what some considered to be the best quarterback in the transfer portal.\n\nLeavitt had some hopes of being a top selection in the upcoming NFL draft, but last year didn't really go as planned. The production was down and a lisfranc injury cut his season short.\n\nLSU has no worry about that dip on the field or that injury. The Tigers will hand Leavitt the most weapons he's had to work with before and Kiffin's teams have become one of the best at developing quarterbacks.\n\nLeavitt has completed 61.4% of his career passes for 4,652 yards and 36 touchdowns to 11 interceptions. He has also run the ball 196 times for 816 yards and 10 more scores. He will be a perfect fit for the Kiffin and Charlie Weis Jr. offense.\n\nLongstreet likely entered the portal with hopes of landing a starting job somewhere, but instead he will remain a backup for this season with the opportunity of learning under Leavitt and Kiffin for a year. Leaving Lincoln Riley isn't something that top quarterbacks are known to do, but this is not a bad spot, either.\n\nWith Leavitt likely heading to the draft next year, Longstreet will be in line to become the starter next season. He was a five-star quarterback in the 2025 class and will have four years of eligibility remaining.\n\nLongstreet is a freak athlete, combining great speed and a very strong arm. It'll be fun to see what kind of player he will be able to develop into.\n\nHe appeared in four games for the USC Trojans this season, completing 13 of his 15 pass attempts for 103 yards and a touchdown. He also ran the ball 11 times for 76 yards and two more scores.\n\nIt was assumed that he was the safety option in case Leavitt went elsewhere, but now LSU gets both. With Peyton Houston coming in as a top high school prospect next year, the Tigers could have their next three starters decided if the transfer portal doesn't break things up.\n\nClark was a three-star transfer and unranked prospect out of high school, but figures to be a top-end backup option. He is known for his cannon of an arm. Kiffin knows what he's doing with small-school, unsuspecting talent.\n\nThe former Elon Phoenix standout completed 56% of his passes last year for 2,321 yards and 18 touchdowns to eight interceptions. He added 189 carries for 614 yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO — Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman spoke with reporters Wednesday for the first time since the Irish were left out of the College Football Playoff.\n\nHe touched on multiple topics, including addressing some big additions through the transfer portal. Here are six things Freeman said:\n\nThe “Here Come the Irish” docuseries on Peacock recently showed the moment the Irish coaches and players found out that Alabama and Miami made the CFP over them.\n\nFreeman stared at the video screen with his mouth open. Players put their faces in their hands.\n\nFreeman said Wednesday that he thought the series properly captured the disappointment and confusion they felt. A month later, he said there’s still disappointment for the Irish, who had been ranked No. 9 or 10 up until the selection show. Miami, which will play Indiana in the national championship Monday, received the last spot in the 12-team CFP.\n\n“But you have to move forward, and that’s what we’ve done as a program,” Freeman said. “That’s what I’ve done as a leader. As I reminded the group in our team meeting on Sunday, it’s our responsibility to make sure we leave no doubt. We can’t blame it on somebody else. Although I may be confused about some of the criteria and the committee’s rankings and all those different things, it’s our job as we move forward to make sure we leave no doubt.”\n\nFreeman said he hasn’t second-guessed his team’s decision to skip a bowl game after being left out of the CFP. He said he was proud of how the captains made the decision and didn’t believe it was an emotional one.\n\nHe asked them again and again if they were sure about the decision.\n\n“Because I didn’t want them to regret it,” Freeman said. “And they were convicted in their decision, and I fully support them.”\n\nFreeman’s name has popped up a few times in this NFL hiring cycle. But he announced he was staying at Notre Dame on Dec. 29, when he posted on social media: “2026…run it back”\n\nFreeman noted that he always tells his players that the future is uncertain.\n\n“But everything I want and everything that I need personally can be achieved right here as a head coach of this program,” he said. “And so I hope this is something we have to address every year. I really do because it means we’re having a lot of success right here at Notre Dame.”\n\nFreeman said he has used discussions with NFL teams to gather information and learn how he can be a better coach. He said he didn’t know if an NFL job would interest him at some point in the future.\n\n“I don’t know enough about it,” he said.” Maybe sometime in the future, if it’s the right time and it’s what I think is right for me, then maybe I’ll pursue it. But I don’t love wasting time thinking about things that aren’t right in front of me, and so I don’t know what I will want in however much length of time from now. I know right now that I am as convicted and motivated to be the best head coach of the Notre Dame football program as I can be.”\n\nLast month, Notre Dame and USC put their 96-game rivalry series on pause because they couldn’t agree to the timing of the 2026 game. The Irish then scheduled BYU for a home-and-home series instead.\n\nFreeman said he believes the rivalry is “important for college football” and the athletic department leaders will work to get it back at some point. But he said the proposed timing wasn’t best for Notre Dame and its 2026 CFP pursuit.\n\n“I’m a competitive individual, right?” Freeman said. “And I want to go play anytime, anywhere, but at the same token, it’s important that I make decisions too that are best for the program. And to move a game that we were pretty sure was going to be Week 12 to Week 0 isn’t what’s best for our program. And they had to make decisions that were best for their program. I don’t blame them. They had to make decisions. We had to make decisions.”\n\nFreeman believes his family’s name was “dragged through the mud unnecessarily” over a recent interaction at a high school wrestling tournament.\n\nAn assistant high school wrestling coach, identified by the South Bend Tribune as Chris Fleeger, accused Freeman of battery at the event, saying Freeman pushed him with two hands. But the St. Joseph County prosecutor’s office said it determined through video evidence and interviews that no criminal battery occurred, and Freeman won’t be charged.\n\n“I was confident in this outcome because I know I did not intentionally touch anyone in a rude, angry or disrespectful way,” Freeman said. “I’m glad this matter has been thoroughly reviewed and resolved.”\n\nFreeman took issue of the initial reporting of the incident by the South Bend Tribune before all of the evidence was released.\n\nNotre Dame said in a statement Sunday that the wrestling coach verbally accosted Freeman’s son, Vinny, a senior who signed to wrestle at Cornell, and Freeman and his wife tried to remove their son from the situation.\n\n“I know I’m a public figure, and I understand the scrutiny that comes with that,” Freeman said. “That scrutiny should not extend to my children or any other child of a public figure.”\n\nThe Irish recently announced the additions of former Ohio State wide receivers Quincy Porter and Mylan Graham.\n\nPorter was the nation’s fifth-ranked wide receiver and the No. 1 player from New Jersey in the 2025 class. He had four catches for 59 yards in four games as an Ohio State freshman after missing some time with an injury.\n\nGraham, who was a five-star prospect and the nation’s fifth-ranked receiver in 2024, had six catches for 93 yards in 2025.\n\n“We knew a lot about them in the high school recruiting process, who they were, the type of players they are,” Freeman said. “And I’m glad we were able to get them.”\n\nNotre Dame also landed in the portal former Alabama edge rusher Keon Keeley, who was a five-star recruit ranked No. 2 in the 247Sports composite rankings in 2023. Keeley originally had committed to Notre Dame out of high school before flipping to Alabama.\n\nFreeman called it “a little delayed gratification.”\n\n“I’ve always believed Keon was a Notre Dame kid coming from his high school,” he said. “He’s such a unique individual. He’s a very talented football player. … When he came on his visit, I’m like, ‘Yep, it’s the same Keon we recruited a couple years ago.’ And he fits here, and I’m excited for his future.”\n\nFreeman said linebacker Drayk Bowen had surgery on the labrum in his hip, but he expects him to return in some capacity this spring.\n\nThe Irish expect linebacker Kyngstonn Viliamu-Asa to be back to full-go around the start of the 2026 season. He is recovering from an ACL injury.",

They starred at Pitt and Nebraska, respectively, before enjoying prolific NFL careers.\n\nHere's the complete list of 18 players and four coaches headed to the Hall in Atlanta.\n\nRB Jerry Azumah – University of New Hampshire (1995-98)\n\nRB Ki-Jana Carter – Penn State (1991-94)\n\nOT Bruce Collie – University of Texas at Arlington (1981-84)\n\nLB George Cumby – Oklahoma (1976-79)\n\nDT Aaron Donald – Pittsburgh (2010-13)\n\nWR/KR Marvin Harrison – Syracuse (1992-95)\n\nRB Garrison Hearst – Georgia (1990-92)\n\nDB Chris Hudson – Colorado (1991-94)\n\nRB Mark Ingram – Alabama (2008-10)\n\nC Olin Kreutz – Washington (1995-97)\n\nLB James Laurinaitis – Ohio State (2005-08)\n\nQB Jordan Lynch – Northern Illinois (2010-13)\n\nWR Herman Moore – Virginia (1988-90)\n\nCB Terence Newman – Kansas State (1999-2002)\n\nOG Bob Novogratz– United States Military Academy (1957-58)\n\nDT Ndamukong Suh – Nebraska (2006-09)\n\nWR Peter Warrick – Florida State (1996-99)\n\nJim Margraff – Johns Hopkins (1990-2018)\n\nChris Petersen – Boise State (2006-13); Washington (2014-19)\n\nKen Sparks – Carson-Newman University (1980-2016)\n\nIngram rushed for 1,658 yards and piled up 20 total touchdowns (17 rushing and three receiving) during the 2009 season. He became the first Alabama player to win the Heisman Trophy, and the Crimson Tide won the BCS national championship. He went on to play 12 seasons in the NFL.\n\nLong before Donald was a three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year, he was ACC Defensive Player of the Year and a whole lot more. In fact, he swept the sport's major defensive awards during his final college season in 2013, when he stacked 28.5 TFLs, 11 sacks and 4 forced fumbles.\n\nSuh went on to earn All-Pro honors five times as a defensive stalwart in the NFL during the 2010s. But first, his play made him a must-watch sensation at Nebraska. In 2008, he recorded two pick 6s, and he notched a receiving touchdown while lining up as a fullback. The next season, he amassed 85 total tackles, 20.5 TFLs and 12 sacks before collecting hardware as college football's top defensive player.\n\nWarrick overlapped with FSU's dominance in the '90s. During the two-time first-team All-American receiver's four seasons with the Seminoles, they were a mainstay at the top of the national polls. He mounted 1,232 receiving yards and 13 total touchdowns in 1998 and then helped FSU win it all in 1999.\n\nHarrison is a Pro Football of Famer, too. He became a household name with the Indianapolis Colts. Before that, however, he developed at Syracuse, where he eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards and tallied two punt return touchdowns in 1995.\n\nPatterson was a TCU staple. He coached the Horned Frogs for 22 seasons, compiling a 181-79 record along the way. He guided them to 11 bowl victories — including a win in the Rose Bowl during the 2010 season another in the Peach Bowl during the 2014 season — and helped them navigate their transitions from Conference USA to the Mountain West and then to the Big 12.\n\nSimilarly, Petersen helped transform Boise State into the football power that it is today. He's the winningest-coach in the Broncos' history. From 2006-13, he went 92-12. In that span, he piloted Boise State to a pair of Fiesta Bowl victories: Those came in 2006 and 2009, each capping undefeated seasons and top-five finishes in the AP Poll. He later led Washington to three straight double-digit-win seasons from 2016-18, picking up a pair of Pac-12 titles in the process.",

    "fullText": "The 2025 college football season concludes on Monday night in Miami Gardens, Florida with the College Football Playoff National Championship Game. After an incredible regular season, an exciting bowl season, and a remarkable playoff, everything comes down to one final game to crown a champion.\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes and the Indiana Hoosiers will kick off at 6:30 p.m. CT at Hard Rock Stadium on January 19th, and a champion will be decided in Year 12 of the CFP and Year 2 of the expanded 12-team playoff.\n\nAfter two very different CFP semifinal games gave us our final two contenders for the national title, it’s time to put a bow on another stellar year of college football and determine who takes home the national championship for 2025.\n\nWhile our focus will be on who the Oklahoma Sooners are still gaining in the transfer portal once it closes on Friday night, we’ll be able to settle in and watch the season’s final game, before a long offseason awaits in college football.\n\nBelow is a full preview for the national championship game. We’ve also included a recap of the 2025 season in week-by-week form, a list of the college football champions at the lower levels, and a list of the FBS college football all-star games that are scheduled in the lead-up to the 2026 NFL Draft in April.\n\nSo, without further ado, the 156th season of college football comes to an end on Monday night. Here’s your preview for the national championship game.\n\nMiami has defeated Texas A&M, Ohio State and Ole Miss in succession to get to this point, after just sneaking into the CFP on selection day. Head coach Mario Cristobal and the Hurricanes have won in different ways during their playoff run, using a suffocating defense in the first two rounds, before getting a big performance from their offense in the semifinal. The ‘Canes have lost twice this season, but they’ve been rolling ever since, and they believe they have the overall talent to pull off a big upset on their home field.\n\nQuarterback Carson Beck had a huge day in the semis, and he’ll have to keep the mistakes down against an opponent that takes advantage of every miscue you make. This is a team that got here based on physicality up front and winning at the line of scrimmage, but a gigantic final test awaits them on Monday night. The U is oh-so close to being “back”, but to win the school’s first national title since 2001, they’ll have to do something no one else has been able to do this year.\n\nIndiana is the only undefeated FBS team, and they earned a bye in the first round of the playoff. Following that off week, they’ve promptly destroyed both Alabama and Oregon on their way to the title round. Head coach Curt Cignetti has turned the Hoosiers into an absolute juggernaut, and this is a veteran team that doesn’t make mistakes and executes at an extremely high level. Their offense is potent, their defense is everywhere, and they’ve taken down teams with far more overall blue-chippers on the roster with regularity.\n\nQuarterback Fernando Mendoza is the Heisman Trophy winner, and he is unbelievably efficient in this offense. With an excellent o-line, and skill players everywhere, it’s hard to keep up with what the Hoosiers are capable of. Defensively, Indiana forces mistakes constantly, and they make good offenses look bad every week. They set their offense up with short fields and squeeze the life out of their opponents. The Hoosiers are heavily favored on Monday, but if the 2025 season has taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected, and that anything is capable of happening.\n\nNCAA Division I FCS: Montana State Bobcats 35, Illinois State Redbirds 34 (OT)\n\nNCAA Division II: Ferris State Bulldogs 42, Harding Bisons 21\n\nNCAA Division III: Wisconsin River-Falls Falcons 24, North Central Cardinals 14\n\nNAIA: Grand View Vikings 22, Kaiser Seahawks 16\n\nNJCAA Division I: Iowa Western Reivers 28, Hutchinson Blue Dragons 10\n\nNJCAA Division III: DuPage Chaparrals 36, North Dakota State College of Science Wildcats 13\n\nCanadian U Sports college football: Montreal Carabins 30, Saskatchewan Huskies 16\n\nHula Bowl: Team Kai 38, Team Aina 21, in DeLand, Florida on January 10th at 11:00 a.m. CT\n\nTropical Bowl: American Team vs. National Team in Orlando, Florida on January 18th at 10:00 a.m. CT\n\nAmerican Bowl: Warhawks vs. Guardians in Lakeland, Florida on January 22nd at 7:00 p.m. CT\n\nEast-West Shrine Bowl: East Team vs. West Team in Frisco, Texas on January 27th at 6:00 p.m. CT\n\nSenior Bowl: American Team vs. National Team in Mobile, Alabama on January 31st at 1:30 p.m. CT\n\nHBCU Legacy Bowl: Team Robinson vs. Team Gaither in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 21st at 3:00 p.m. CT\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions. You can also follow Aaron on X@Aaron_Gelvin.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sooners Wire: Who will win the college football championship for the 2025 season?",

    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff reaches a thrilling conclusion on Monday night, and there are a few avenues to explore if you're looking to attend in person. Below, we've outlined everything you need to know about how to get College Football National Championship tickets in 2026, including a comparison of resale ticket prices.\n\nThe 2025 college football season concludes with a January 19, 2026, match-up between the No. 10 Miami Hurricanes and the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers. The two teams will face off at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, home of the Miami Dolphins. Miami beat Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl, and Indiana defeated Oregon in the Peach Bowl, sending the playoff underdog and top seed to the National Championship, where they're both vying for a shot at their first national title in the CFP era.\n\nGetting your hands on tickets to the championship can be tricky, and most tickets are only available through resale sites at the moment. We've compared prices across some of the top resellers, including StubHub and Vivid Seats.\n\nMost College Football Playoff National Championship tickets are sent to the respective schools involved and sold through each institution. On the Miami Hurricanes website, the Miami ticket allotment has sold out. We're also not seeing any tickets available through the Indiana Hoosiers website. This means that the resale ticket market is the next best place to snag a seat if you're still hoping to attend.\n\nThe official fan-to-fan exchange marketplace for the National Championship is through Ticketmaster, but we're also seeing listings on StubHub and Vivid Seats.\n\nThe cheapest resale listings we're seeing right now come from Vivid Seats, where ticket prices start at $2,899. On StubHub, the cheapest resale ticket listings start at $2,965. On Ticketmaster, the cheapest resale tickets start at $3,094. Prices are accurate at the time of writing, but they often fluctuate throughout the day as tickets are purchased and additional listings are added to the sites. The cheapest tickets are for Upper Level seats, while resale listings close to the field are reaching upwards of $15,000 across all sites.\n\nNote: Certain services and regions prohibit the resale of tickets. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal reselling of tickets, and entry into an event is at the venue's discretion.",

There will be points in bunches available against a porous Arizona State defense surrendering 78.8 ppg and ranking 116th in adjusted defensive efficiency.\n\nBoth teams look to push the pace: the Wildcats rank 26th in adjusted tempo, and the Sun Devils are not far behind at 70th. There will be an abundance of possessions in this high-flying game, and the Wildcats will be able to score efficiently.\n\nArizona guard Jaden Bradley has posted at least five assists in four of his last five games, averaging 5.8 in that span. In an up-tempo game with a high team total, Arizona should do plenty of scoring, and that typically starts with Bradley as the lead guard.\n\nMassambia Diop is a true freshman sensation for the Sun Devils. He’s 7-foot-1 and has tremendous side-to-side agility, so he’ll be on the court for as many minutes as he can handle against a tough opponent with a strong frontcourt.\n\nHe’s picked up his scoring output as he gets more comfortable with the college game, scoring 16+ in each of his last four contests while averaging 19.8 in that span.\n\nMassambia Diop Over 15.5 points\n\nThis wide spread implies Arizona will win in a dominant blowout. While the Wildcats are certainly good enough to make that happen, that’s a narrow outcome to bank on from a betting perspective.\n\nThis is still a rivalry game, after all, and Arizona State has covered the spread in 10 of its last 14 road games.\n\nMassambia Diop Over 15.5 points\n\nSpread: Arizona State +22 | Arizona -22\n\nMoneyline: Arizona State +1600 | Arizona -5000\n\nOver/Under: Over 168 | Under 168\n\nArizona has scored at least 95 points in seven consecutive home games.

    "description": "I graduated from college and moved to New York City to apply for full-time jobs. I haven't found one yet, but I've learned to prioritize my hobbies.",
    "fullText": "Before graduating from Syracuse University last spring with a degree in journalism, it seemed like everyone (including me) was scrambling to make plans, get jobs, and figure out where to move.\n\nI always expected life after college would fall seamlessly into place, that all of my involvement in campus media, internships, and good grades would pay off immediately.\n\nSo, when I learned that my childhood friend was planning to move to New York City, it was the perfect opportunity to take the leap together. I'd always dreamed of moving there, and as the home of many big-name publications, it seemed like the right city to be in to kick-start my career.\n\nCome June, I'd moved, gotten a job at a coffee shop, and continued applying to every dream job under the sun (just like the hundreds of other LinkedIn applicants).\n\nLittle did I know, the barista position I'd only planned to have for a month or two would still be my lifeline seven months later.\n\nAt the beginning of my job search, I was incredibly motivated, but slowly, the rejections began to roll in.\n\nI started feeling like maybe I was the problem, that my experiences and skills weren't good enough. How was I supposed to gain more experience if no one would hire me?\n\nImposter syndrome hit me hard, especially since it seemed like the first question anyone wanted to ask me was, \"What do you do?\"\n\nAt first, I'd provide a whole spiel: I just graduated and am working as a barista while I look for a job in journalism, and interviews are going well. I always felt the need to make it appear as though I was on the brink of getting \"the job.\"\n\nThe catalyst for shifting my mindset came later, over dinner with a friend at our favorite Indian restaurant. We talked about life, relationships, New York work culture, and overall, what it means to unplug from the outside world for a second.\n\nMy friend shared his thoughts on being part of corporate America and said he doesn't base his worth on the job he has or his level of success. His words made me think about my own self-worth and why I'd been placing it all on my career and how qualified I am compared to others.\n\nNow, when I'm faced with the \"what do you do\" question, I say I'm a barista and freelancer looking for full-time work in journalism.\n\nI'm less concerned with explaining why I'm not working in corporate yet and more concerned with maintaining my peace and joy, as well as exploring my other interests.\n\nAlthough people's responses to my answers haven't changed much, my confidence in where I'm at and where I'm going has.\n\nAlthough this isn't the life I envisioned having after graduation, I'm grateful for the time I've had to explore my hobbies and be an active member of my community.\n\nAs an avid yogi and certified yoga teacher, I've enjoyed taking free yoga classes in Bryant Park. It's been a great way to get moving, plus it's given me a reason to stop with the endless job applications and catch up with some friends.\n\nIn my free time after barista shifts, I even parlayed my love of yoga into a three-month stint as a front desk receptionist at a studio in SoHo. In exchange for three hours of dedication a week, I got to take unlimited classes from some of the best yoga teachers I've ever had.\n\nAside from yoga, I also signed up with my roommate to volunteer within my Muslim community and teach religious education classes to kids.\n\nGrowing up, I loved attending these classes; it connected me to my culture and was also how my roommate and I met as kids. So, participating in this has felt like a full-circle moment that I likely wouldn't have had if I were already working full-time.\n\nHowever, despite finding a great community, I've found my feelings of imposter syndrome are still present — fueled by the overwhelming chaos and fast-paced energy of the city.\n\nOver the last few months, I've learned NYC isn't the best place for me — at least not right now.\n\nI always come home feeling like I haven't done enough, and it exhausts me. This is partially a result of my mindset, but I also think it's a direct consequence of living in a place known for its hustle.\n\nAlthough living here has been a great experience and played a huge role in helping me gain confidence, I'm ready for somewhere that's slower-paced.\n\nThere are, of course, still days when I struggle with my own self-talk and understanding my purpose, but I'm confident a move is the best next step for me as I continue working toward my goals and exploring all of the other things that make me who I am.\n\nMy time in the industry will come, and until then, I'll keep side-questing and doing everything I can to remain happy and present.",

    "fullText": "If the season ended today, the Spartans would land as one of the higher seeds in the NCAA Tournament, according to one college hockey analyst.\n\nA popular college hockey social media account released an updated batch of bracketology projections earlier this week, which has the Spartans cemented in the tournament field. College Puck NXT has Michigan State as a No. 2 seed in the Loveland, Colo.-based region. The Spartans would be slated to face No. 3 seed Denver in the first round of the tournament, according to this bracket projection.\n\nMichigan State ranks as the No. 4 team nationally in this week's USCHO.com poll, and holds an impressive 15-5-0 record on the year. The Spartans, though, haven't been as dominant during the regular season as we've seen in the last two seasons -- which they ended up with No. 1 seeds in each year.\n\nMichigan State is set to play a massive two-game road series at No. 2 Wisconsin this weekend. This will certainly be a set of games that could help raise the Spartans' tournament stock should they come out with a win or two.\n\nClick on the post below to see the complete NCAA Tournament bracket projection:\n\nFIRST College Puck NXT Bracketology of 2026\n\nKey Notes🎶\n🧮Seedings & Order based on CURRENT NPI\n🧐 IF the season ended today Hockey East would have ONE NCAA Tourney representative after sending SIX teams to the tourney last season\n🤯ECAC & CCHA would send 6 of 16 teams… pic.twitter.com/W2DzoYv2sx\n\n— College Puck NXT (@CollegePuckNXT) January 12, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page onFacebookto follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "fullText": "After missing his \"College Gameday\" appearance before the Aggies competed against the Hurricanes in the first round of the CFP, former Heisman-winning quarterback and Texas A&M legend Johnny Manziel explained his side of the story on his Glory Daze podcast.\n\nAccording to Manziel, he missed the scheduled appearance as a guest picker due to a virus that made him sick the night before. He originally planned to attend with music artist Drake and watch Texas A&M take on Miami, but the illness prevented that.\n\nManziel played for the Aggies in 2012 and 2013, becoming the first-ever freshman Heisman winner and just the second player to win the award in program history. Here is the full clip of Manziel discussing the incident that led to his missed appearance.\n\nFormer Texas A&M QB Johnny Manziel explained on his podcast what went into him missing his scheduled “College GameDay” appearance for A&M vs. Miami. He said he planned to go to the game with Drake but got sick the night before with an “unbelievable” virus. https://t.co/jYbSoxsig8 pic.twitter.com/Z7guLzSghd\n\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) January 8, 2026\n\nWhile rumors ran rampant across social media when former Aggie basketball player Alex Caruso was named the guest picker in place of Manziel, he seemed to shut those down on the most recent episode of his podcast. Manziel was in attendance for multiple contests at Kyle Field in 2025, while also spending time with current Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed, who displayed much improvement this season at the helm and will return to play for the Maroon and White for his junior season.\n\nThe year didn't conclude as the Aggies had wished, but head coach Mike Elko has led the program to historic heights in just his second season coaching in Bryan-College Station, Texas. Elko's squad secured the school's first 11-0 start since 1992 and its first playoff appearance in 2025.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Dylan on X: @dylanmflippo.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Former Texas A&M QB Johnny Manziel explains \"College Gameday\" absence",

    "description": "With the 2025 portion of the college women's basketball season over, here's who is shaping up to be one of the teams in the 2026 Final Four.",
    "fullText": "It’s a big year for college women’s basketball in Phoenix, with the Final Four heading to Mortgage Matchup Center on April 3-5, and the potential four teams are taking shape.\n\nWhile there are less than three months before the bracket is set, several leading contenders have emerged. Some schools are blue bloods, while others have steadily become powerhouses.\n\nEach team is led by a cast of stars who will undoubtedly make it an exciting stretch ahead of the Final Four.\n\nThe No. 1 Huskies are a heavy favorite to go undefeated in the regular season, which also makes them a heavy favorite for the Final Four.\n\nThe program’s 15-0 start marks its best opening since the 2017-18 season, when it won its first 36 contests before falling, 91-89 in overtime, to Notre Dame in the national championship game.\n\nSophomore forward Sarah Strong, at the forefront of UConn’s success, has made a compelling case for National Player of the Year. Guard Azzi Fudd has also been playing a big role, furthering the Huskies’ bid for a repeat as champions.\n\nIt’s been another big season for No. 2 Texas as the Longhorns basically drifted through nonconference play.\n\nTexas (17-0) didn’t have an easy schedule, but made quick work of several Top 25 teams, including a 76-65 win over then-No. 3 UCLA. Only South Carolina and Ole Miss have challenged the Longhorns so far, with Texas winning by one possession in both games.\n\nFifth-year point guard Rori Harmon is one of the best in the country and has been the engine for the team. Leading scorer Madison Booker has been having another productive season with at least 20 points in five of her past seven games through Jan. 6.\n\nThe Longhorns have a great shot of getting back to the Final Four for the second consecutive year.\n\nUnder coach Dawn Staley, the Gamecocks are always in consideration for the Final Four.\n\nSince losing in last season’s national title game against UConn, South Carolina has dealt with a great deal of adversity in a short span. The Gamecocks received unfortunate news when forward Chloe Kitts tore her ACL in September, sidelining her for the season.\n\nMore recently, key transfer Ta’Niya Latson injured her ankle in late December and has been day-to-day. The starting guard has averaged 16.9 points this season, and was the scoring leader last season at North Carolina State with 25.2 points per game.\n\nHowever, the Gamecocks have found ways to continue their high-level play. Sophomore forward Joyce Edwards leads the team with 21.0 points. Center Madina Okot has been stellar with 11.5 rebounds per game. South Carolina will soon receive more help in the post with Alicia Tournebize, a 6-foot-7-inch player from France, joining the team midseason and gearing up to play.\n\nOne of the more experienced teams in the NCAA, the Bruins have a great shot of making their second straight Final Four appearance, especially with it potentially being center Lauren Betts’ final season.\n\nBetts, expected to go in the top five of the 2026 WNBA Draft, has surpassed 1,500 career points and has made important defensive plays in the biggest moments for the Bruins.\n\nWhile Betts has been key to UCLA’s success, she’s also been surrounded by depth in senior starters Kiki Rice, Gianna Kneepkens, Charlisse Leger-Walker and Gabriela Jaquez.\n\nUCLA’s starting lineup has combined to play 581 collegiate games, which can play a big factor in winning the Big Ten championship and eventually reaching the Final Four.\n\nThere are a lot of SEC teams that have impressed this season, and the Sooners have shown that they deserve to be considered with the likes of Texas and South Carolina.\n\nThe program has steadily improved under fourth-year head coach Jennie Baranczyk, who took Oklahoma to its first Sweet 16 since 2013 last season. Baranczyk has taken the Sooners to at least the second round of the NCAA Tournament in all four seasons.\n\nOklahoma (14-1) has only gotten better, adding highly touted recruit Aaliyah Chavez to its roster. The guard leads the Sooners and is fourth among freshmen nationally with 18.9 points per game.\n\nThe Sooners rank second in scoring offense at 94.5 points per game, while leading the country in field goal percentage defense (29.8%) and rebounds per game (53.1).\n\nSenior center Raegan Beers has continued to be a force on the boards, ranking 10th nationally with 10.8 rebounds per game. She's also second on the team with 17.4 points.\n\nThe only problem is that Oklahoma will have to play Texas and South Carolina in the regular season, and potentially in the SEC Tournament. One of those teams could hurt the others' chances of gaining a higher seed in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nReach the reporter at jenna.ortiz@arizonarepublic.com, as well as @jennarortiz on X.\n\nCatch the best high school sports coverage in the state.

A win for Ohio State would also make them 4-0 in Big Ten road games for the first time since the 2017-18 team, which won its first five Big Ten road games.\n\nWith Brandon Noel out for the foreseeable future with an unspecified foot injury, Gabe Cupps stepped up for Ohio State against Oregon, scoring nine points on 3-of-4 shooting in 23 minutes. Devin Royal registered his third double-double of the season, scoring 14 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in 36 minutes.\n\nThe Huskies could be without two of their four leading scorers on Sunday night, but their availability won’t be known until closer to game time. Senior guard Desmond Claude is currently away from the team due to a personal matter, and was not at practice on Saturday. Sophomore guard Wesley Yates has missed Washington’s last four games with a wrist injury, and will be a game-time decision on Sunday night. Washington coach Danny Sprinkle has not ruled either player out, but said that if Yates plays, his minutes will be limited.\n\nConnect with Connor: \nTwitter: @lemons_connor",

I think it’s really important to re-emphasize. When you watch a team, and I always come in on Sunday and get ready to watch a team or get ready to play, some things stand out. I don’t watch, necessarily, the — hey, that’s a great touchdown pass.

You never see what happened, like the pick six, where a guy misses a block or something happens. So, perimeter blocking. How about the running back steps up and hits a linebacker or safety coming from a 10-yard running start and the running back hits him right in the jaw,” Meyer said. “And Mendoza completes a pass. The route efficiency. There’s no wasted movement when the receivers run their routes. Those aren’t all five-star receivers; those aren’t first-rounders. Those are guys that are really, really good players that play great.\"\n\nThey will have a chance to showcase themselves once more against a Hurricanes team on a mission to continue shocking college football as they upset Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl before ending Ole Miss' season in the Fiesta Bowl to get to the title game themselves.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Indiana Hoosiers are on the doorstep of college football history, carrying an unbeaten season into the national championship game with a chance to accomplish something no modern team ever has.\n\nAt 15-0, Indiana is already one of just five teams in the modern era to reach that mark. A win against the Miami Hurricanes would make the Hoosiers the first major college football program to finish 16-0 since Yale Bulldogs accomplished the feat in 1894 — an era of leather helmets and no forward pass.\n\nWhat makes Indiana’s run even more remarkable is how it was built.

    "fullText": "Indiana left no doubt Friday night, rolling No. 5 Oregon 56–22 in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl to move within one win of a national title.\n\nThe Hoosiers struck immediately when D’Angelo Ponds returned an interception for a touchdown on Oregon’s first offensive snap. Indiana scored touchdowns on five straight possessions, four before halftime, to build a 35–7 lead.\n\nHeisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza threw five touchdown passes, while Oregon quarterback Dante Moore struggled under pressure, committing three first-half turnovers despite passing for 285 yards and two scores. Indiana repeatedly turned short fields into points.\n\nThe 56 points were the most Oregon has allowed in 41 postseason games and the most since Washington scored 70 in 2016. As soon as the final whistle blew on the Hoosiers’ 56–22 College Football Playoff semifinal win, fans turned their attention to the next target: Miami.\n\nWith Hall of Famer Michael Irvin, one of the Hurricanes’ most iconic legends, looming as symbolic motivation, Indiana fans made it clear they believe the belt is coming north.\n\nIrvin has used the phrase “belt to a*s” and the accompanying motion as a declaration of dominance, particularly when speaking about Miami’s swagger and physicality. But after watching Indiana dismantle Oregon on a national stage, Hoosier fans warned Miami that the belt is changing hands.\n\n“Indiana gonna whoop Miami. They gonna take the belt from Michael Irvin,” one fan commented. “The Philly Special,” one said while referring to a video of a Hoosier fan absolutely demolishing a toy duck. “MIAMI IS NEXT,” another warned.\n\nIndiana didn’t just beat Oregon in the Peach Bowl; they humiliated a program that entered the College Football Playoff riding momentum and confidence. By the time the fourth quarter arrived, the outcome was long decided, and the Ducks were simply trying to survive the night.\n\nIndiana (15–0) advances to the College Football Playoff Championship Game, where it will face Miami (13–2) on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nOregon (13–2), meanwhile, heads into the offseason following another lopsided postseason loss. A year after a 41–21 Rose Bowl defeat to Ohio State, the Ducks saw their title hopes end again in emphatic fashion. Both of Oregon’s losses this season came against Indiana, each by double-digit margins, despite the Ducks recording the third 13-win season in program history.\n\nThe post “They Gonna Take the Belt From Michael Irvin”: Indiana Fans Warn Miami After Crushing Oregon in Semis appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Fernando Mendoza and the Hoosiers have once again laid waste to one of the best teams in college football. And only one remains.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA — The air horn at Mercedes-Benz Stadium blasted for the first time Friday night after just 11 seconds. It’s a distinct, piercing sound with a unique local story, ringing through the sky here after every touchdown.\n\nThis city began to sprout up from the ground nearly two centuries ago because it is where the Western & Atlantic railroad made its last stop. With a stake hammered into the ground, they originally called it Terminus — the end of the line.\n\nSince erecting this modern football palace nine years ago and adding the train horn to commemorate how it all began, nearly every great college football team has come through Atlanta on its way to a national title.\n\nBut none have embodied that sound quite like Indiana.\n\nSleek and efficient, powerful and unrelenting, the Indiana Hoosiers — yes, the Indiana Hoosiers — are barreling down the tracks like a locomotive running late for a date with destiny, blowing that horn as a warning to any creature in its path.\n\nHey, after 139 years of mostly bad Indiana football, what’s another 10 days to become the most mesmerizing national champion we’ve ever seen?\n\nPerhaps the Jan. 19 national championship game against Miami will become something other than a Hoosier coronation. But after Indiana’s tour de force through the College Football Playoff, including a savage 56-22 beatdown of Oregon here in the Peach Bowl, rarely have we encountered a college football team that looks and feels more inevitable than this one.\n\n“They’re complete,” Oregon coach Dan Lanning said. “They do a lot, and they do it really, really well. There’s not a weakness in their game. They run the ball well, they stop the run well, they throw the ball well, they defend the pass well, they've been good on special teams. They obviously have a ton of belief, and deservedly so. They’re really good.”\n\nOregon, it turned out, never really had a chance.\n\nWhen these two teams played in mid-October, with Indiana winning 30-20 on the road in Autzen Stadium, the game was competitive enough to make a dramatic rematch seem plausible.\n\nBut it took 11 seconds to realize Indiana football has subsequently evolved into something different. It is now a weapon sharpened for dissection, a machine built for humiliation, deployed with confidence and precision as its coach stalks the sideline with an eternal expression of annoyance.\n\nOn the first play from scrimmage, Indiana cornerback D’Angelo Ponds — one of the many players who followed coach Curt Cignetti from James Madison to Indiana two years ago — read the eyes of Oregon quarterback Dante Moore, jumped the route and snagged a pick-6 to trip that air horn for the first time.\n\nThen Indiana did it four more times before the first half concluded, each one chipping away at Oregon’s belief until it became a myth. By the time both teams went to the locker room with the Hoosiers leading 35-7, the only point of comparison for a CFP semifinal in this building was LSU’s 63-28 win over Oklahoma six years ago.\n\nSince that season, 2019 LSU has remained the gold standard for modern-era college football dominance, a team so ruthless in the way it attacked opponents that most realized after awhile they never had a chance in the first place.\n\nIndiana is one more performance like this from taking their crown.\n\n“A lot of people [who doubted us] really don't know our team,” Cignetti said. “They don't know what we're made of, what we got, and I get it. There was a lot of skepticism after last year that we were a fluke. That team did a lot of great things and got it all started. We’ve just built off our successes, and we've won some big games on the road, and it helps when you have a quarterback play his best football when the game's online in the fourth quarter. And so, you know, here we are.”\n\nPlayer for player, the Hurricanes will believe they’re the better team based on recruiting rankings, physical size and NFL Draft stock. But so did Oregon and Alabama, which lost to the Hoosiers by a combined 69 points in this playoff.\n\nWith Indiana, it’s not about the measurables. All season long, the Hoosiers have been a nuclear missile of execution and attitude, mocking anyone who dared not believe a program with a litany of laments and losing seasons could turn into this juggernaut practically overnight.\n\nIt was the seventh time against an FBS opponent this year Indiana has won by 30 or more points, and at every turn, they’ve thirsted for more. Beating Ohio State to become Big Ten champs for the first time since 1967? Not enough. A Rose Bowl romp over Alabama? They expected it long before we realized it was possible.\n\nEven when this game against Oregon was well in hand in the fourth quarter, Indiana kept delivering indignities. Only after one final 24-yard touchdown run by Kaelon Black, which drew the slightest smile from Cignetti’s lips with 5:14 to go, had Indiana’s appetite been satisfied. For a little while, anyway.\n\n“Our philosophy is to attack,” Cignetti said. “The reason we are where we are is because we prepared the right way, and that's why we've been able to meet the challenge and put it on the field.”\n\nAnd when the game finally ended, it looked like the most perfunctory of Indiana’s three big celebrations this postseason. This wasn’t like the relief of conquering the Big Ten or the sheer joy of reducing college football’s most iconic brand to a bystander in Pasadena. This was the moment before the moment, the one that seems poised to stamp Indiana as the greatest turnaround story maybe in the history of American sports.\n\n“I don’t think there’s any time to celebrate because this is what everybody dreams of,” Mendoza said.\n\nNow just one game remains as the Indiana train rolls through Atlanta, headed to Miami at maximum speed. To Terminus and beyond.",

    "description": "For the second year in a row, Oregon was blown out in the College Football Playoff when it fell to Indiana. Where do the Ducks go from here.",
    "fullText": "ATLANTA — Oregon will chew on this one for 239 days, reliving a 56-22 blowout loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl again and again until its 2026 season kicks off against Boise State on Sept 5.\n\nIf only these new Hoosiers were still the same-old Hoosiers. If only. The Indiana program’s evolution into a Power Four devourer of worlds was the one hurdle in the Ducks’ path during a season that can split into two camps: on one side, two losses in two games against Hoosiers; on the other, 13 wins in as many tries against everyone else.\n\nOregon bulldozed No. 12 seed James Madison in the opening round of the College Football Playoff and then did the same to No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl. But Indiana presented a challenge Oregon couldn’t overcome. That no one else has conquered the Hoosiers doesn’t make this one any easier to swallow.\n\nPATH TO PLAYOFF: \n“I think it's probably too premature for me to speak on what happened tonight until I go back and really evaluate it,” said Oregon coach Dan Lanning. “I also think you can't discredit that we played well. We've played well at times even here in the postseason. Yeah, there will be an opportunity for reflection and evaluation, but I couldn't speak on that right now.”\n\nOn the heels of a second one-sided playoff loss to a Big Ten foe in as many years — the 2024 Ducks went unbeaten in the regular season and won the conference but suffered a 41-24 loss to Ohio State in the Rose Bowl that was over in the first half — Oregon can only wonder:\n\nHow did this happen? And what do we have to change to finally capture an elusive national title?\n\n“Man, you hurt for those guys because the world is going to judge everybody in that room based on the result tonight,” said Lanning. “They're not failures. These guys won a lot of damn ball games. They've had a lot of success. They've changed some peoples' lives, but right now, that moment is going to hurt.”\n\nThe first question is easy to answer. Indiana is unquestionably the better team, defying recruiting rankings that heavily favor Oregon. In every way and on nearly every play, the Hoosiers dictated the terms to the Ducks, just as they did earlier this month in a similar rout of No. 9 seed Alabama in the Rose Bowl.\n\nBut in addition to being more physical and more explosive on both sides of the ball, Indiana was unmoved by the high-pressure stakes that have come with each new achievement this team has unlocked during a breathtaking 2025 season.\n\nThe same can’t be said of Oregon. To suffer another meltdown on this stage raises significant concerns about the Ducks’ preparedness and mindset in neutral-site games against the best of the best.\n\n“Man, I feel like the gameplan we had was awesome,” said Oregon guard Dave Iuli. “I just feel like, you know, we went out there and didn’t execute our jobs. Usually, when it comes to critical moments like this with three teams left or four teams left, the biggest thing is executing. Once people stopped executing, we stopped winning.”\n\nQuarterback Dante Moore tossed a pick-six on the first play from scrimmage. He fumbled with 9:29 left in the second quarter to goose an Indiana touchdown drive that put the Hoosiers up 21-7. He fumbled again about seven minutes later to set up another touchdown, making it 35-7 at the half.\n\nWith lead running backs Noah Whittington and Jordon Davison unable to play due to injury, backups Dierre Hill Jr. and Jay Harris combined for 121 yards on 21 carries. But the Ducks ran for 93 yards on 3.6 yards per carry as a team, counting sacks, with 71 yards coming on a Hill run in the third quarter when they were down 35 points.\n\nOffensively, Oregon was wobbled early and remained off-balance the rest of the way, unable to regain its footing as Indiana pinned its ears back and threw the kitchen sink at Moore.\n\n“They have a great defense, great disguise and different looks, but you can't win football games if you're causing turnovers,” Moore said. “But overall, I mean, Indiana’s defense is great, defensive coordinator, but at the end of the day, we beat ourselves.”\n\nDefensively, a group that engulfed the Duke and the Red Raiders was helpless against Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza and a brilliant, steady-handed receiver corps headed by Elijah Sarrat (75 yards and two touchdowns), Omar Cooper Jr. (one score) and Charlie Becker (48 yards and two scores).\n\nWhile the Hoosiers had three sacks and 10 tackles for loss, Oregon’s defensive front barely sniffed Mendoza, who continued his Joe Burrow-like postseason run by hitting on 17 of 20 passes for 177 yards and five touchdowns. Through two playoff games, he has more touchdowns, eight, than incompletions, five.\n\nAnd while the Ducks committed three game-changing giveaways in the first half, Indiana continued to play nearly perfect football. The Hoosiers turned the ball over with a fumble on their 18th play from scrimmage in the season opener against Old Dominion but have not lost a fumble since.\n\nAdding insult to injury, an Oregon punt near its own goal line in the fourth quarter was blocked by Indiaan, which then scored on a short Mendoza pass to Sarratt for a third touchdown drive lasting fewer than 22 yards.\n\n“Yeah, it sucks right now,” said linebacker Bryce Boettcher. “I'm not going to lie. Not how I envisioned it whatsoever. Obviously prepared to win, and Indiana was a better team tonight. Doesn't take away from our season. We had one heck of a season.”\n\nIt's possible to look at this loss with a slightly optimistic slant: Oregon was minus-three in turnover margin and doomed its own chances against the No. 1-ranked team in the country. The loss hurts, sure, but the Ducks have still gone 26-3 since joining the Big Ten last season. There is no question this is an elite program.\n\nYet regular-season success is just not translating to the postseason. As the Ducks head into a crucial offseason defined by their ability to rebuild a roster set to be picked apart by graduation and early NFL draft entries, Lanning’s biggest charge will be assessing and fixing the flaws that have led to two humbling playoff losses in as many years.\n\nOne common thread has been a flat and sluggish start. The Buckeyes buried the Ducks by taking a 34-0 lead in the second quarter of last January’s Rose Bowl. Indiana led by 28 at the break. While the Ducks flopped out of the gate and never recovered, the Hoosiers resembled an unstoppable, merciless, Terminator-like machine that craves to not just beat their opponent but bury them.\n\nTo say the Ducks were simply outmanned by one eventual champion in Ohio State and a potentially historic squad in Indiana is way too tidy an explanation. That excuse works for the have-nots in the Big Ten and elsewhere, teams that expect to be body-slammed by the best of the best in the Power Four.\n\nThat’s not Oregon. The Ducks have higher aspirations; in fact, the program rightfully believes it can beat anyone, anywhere, under any conditions, after spending most of this century knocking on the door of the national title.\n\nBut it was one thing to reach the title game against Auburn in the Bowl Championship Series era and against Ohio State in the first year of the four-team playoff format. Winning the 12-team reboot requires much more: Teams need to be almost perfectly constructed and mentally unflappable to thrive against this gauntlet.\n\nAgain, that’s not Oregon, which is built to reach this point but not to advance. For a program that believes a title is part of its destiny, this loss should trigger a long offseason of soul-searching, with plenty of questions but no obvious answers.\n\n“I think every man can learn from adversity. I just told that whole locker room, right, this is going to be about how you respond in life,” said Lanning.\n\n“This is going to be a life lesson that a lot of people never get. We just got our butt kicked. Right? That's going to happen in life, right, and not just Dante. Every single person in the locker room, every coach, every person can learn, ‘Hey, how do you respond to that?’”\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Oregon after CFP blowout loss in Peach Bowl faces soul-searching",

Third-party deals, often arranged by businesses created to back the schools, are being used as workarounds this so-called salary cap.\n\nThe CSC, through its NIL Go portal, is supposed to evaluate those deals to make sure they are for a valid business purpose and fall within a fair range of compensation for the services being provided.\n\nThe CSC did not list examples of unapproved contracts, but college football has seen its share of seven-figure deals luring players to new schools since the transfer portal opened on Jan. 2.\n\nOne high-profile case involved Washington quarterback Demond Williams Jr., who initially sought to enter the transfer portal and turn his back on a reported deal worth $4 million with the Huskies. Legal threats ensued and Williams changed course and stayed at Washington.\n\n\"Making promises of third-party NIL money now and figuring out how to honor those promises later leaves student-athletes vulnerable to deals not being cleared, promises not being able to be kept, and eligibility being placed at risk,\" the CSC letter said.\n\nThe commission listed two rules about contracts it evaluates, some of which have been termed “agency agreement” or “services agreement” in what look like attempts to bypass the rules.\n\n—\"The label on the contract does not change the analysis; if an entity is agreeing to pay a student-athlete for their NIL, the agreement must be reported to NIL Go within the reporting deadline.\"\n\n—\"An NIL agreement or payment with an associated entity or individual ... must include direct activation of the student-athlete’s NIL rights.\" This is a reference to the practice of “warehousing” NIL rights by paying first, then deciding how to use them later.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Indiana vs. Oregon\n\nCollege Football Playoff schedule 2026\n\nWhen the No. 7 Indiana Hoosiers defeated the No. 3 Oregon Ducks in Autzen Stadium on October 11, Curt Cignetti and the Hoosiers finally announced their status as the new college football powerhouse. This 30-20 performance in one of the sport's most hostile environments was the season’s inflection point, cementing Indiana’s spectacular rise from historical underdog to national title contender.\n\nNow, less than three months later, the undefeated Hoosiers and the 13-1 Ducks meet again in the 2026 College Football Playoff semifinals. This is a clash of two established heavyweights, the last two Big Ten champions, led by two of the sport’s most successful and dynamic program builders, meeting with everything on the line.\n\nCignetti is the ultimate program architect, having accomplished a turnaround many call the greatest in college football history. Taking over the losingest program in the sport, Cignetti immediately installed a championship culture, leading the Hoosiers to a remarkable 25-2 record in two years in Bloomington. That run peaked just days ago with a 38-3 thrashing of perennial powerhouse Alabama in the Rose Bowl. Now in his second season, Cignetti has led Indiana to an undefeated campaign, the program's first-ever No. 1 ranking, and their first outright Big Ten championship since 1945.\n\nAcross the field is Dan Lanning, the defensive mastermind who has rapidly transformed Oregon into a consistent powerhouse, never missing a beat in a new conference landscape. Since taking over in Eugene, Lanning is a staggering 48-7, a tenure that includes leading Oregon to an undefeated season and Big Ten championship in their first year in the conference. While the Ducks experienced playoff heartbreak last season, they have since rattled off two dominating wins in the 2025 postseason to set up a rematch with the only team that has beat them this season.\n\nThe electric tension of this high-stakes rematch is amplified by the star power under center — two phenomenal quarterbacks whose seasons have carried their teams to the precipice of a national championship appearance. Fernando Mendoza became the first Indiana player ever to win the Heisman Trophy, leading the nation in total touchdowns. For Oregon, the offense flows through the arm of Dante Moore, who has orchestrated one of the most explosive and balanced attacks in the nation, thriving in Lanning’s system with pinpoint accuracy and commanding control.\n\nThe No. 1 Hoosiers and No. 5 Ducks have been, without question, two of the best teams in college football in 2025: both rank top-10 in scoring offense and scoring defense, boast explosive stars on both sides of the ball, and are guided by two of the sharpest coaches in the game. That's why they own a combined record of 27-1 and now face off for a national championship berth, with one team a win away from bringing home its first title in school history.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scoring updates and highlights for Indiana vs. Oregon in the College Football Playoff semifinals.

    "description": "\"For Love & Money\" answers your relationship and money questions. This week, a reader is angry about her parents' adapted parenting style.",
    "fullText": "I am the oldest daughter of three siblings. I'm three years older than my brother and 12 years older than my sister. We have a great, tight-knit family, and my parents have always showered us with love.\n\nHowever, my issue is that my parents have changed their parenting style, and my younger sister is having a very different experience from the one I had, even though my dad still works the same job as he did 12 years ago, and my mom still stays home.\n\nI had to work and take out loans to attend college and cover my lifestyle needs after graduating from high school. However, I found out over the holidays that my sister, who graduates this spring, will attend college entirely on my parents' dime. She has never had to work a job because they worry it will distract her from her grades.\n\nI barely concealed my anger when I found out, but the more I think about it, the angrier I get. I don't want to start anything with my parents, and I do like where I am in life, but my late teens and early 20s were really difficult for me, and I am still repaying student loans. I know if I don't confront them about this now, I'm likely to blow up on them about it eventually. How do I talk to them about this?\n\nOn a crisp April day in 2004, my mom picked me up from my homeschool co-op with a surprise in the back seat: a tiny baby girl, 15 years my junior. In the early days, I helped my mom care for my little sister, but within a few years, I transitioned to being more like a frequent houseguest after leaving for college. I wanted to bond with my sister during my visits home, but I often found myself distracted by my parents' brand-new parenting style, in which screen limits ceased to exist and the \"Oh come on, you aren't sick!\" of my childhood was replaced with \"I don't think she feels good\" every time my sister misbehaved.\n\nComedian Nate Bergatze has a great bit on this phenomenon, describing his much younger sister apparently being \"raised by her best friends\" rather than by the tightly structured, rule-heavy parents who defined his own upbringing.\n\nAs I was writing this column, I texted my mother to ask her about the disparity. She explained, \"As a young parent, you think your kids aren't bothered or harmed by various external hardships. But as you get older, you see the impact, and so you become more protective of your younger child's emotional health, and that might look like too much grace.\"\n\nMy mom's explanation seems to tally with your experience. Your struggles in your late teens and early 20s are likely the very reason your parents have tried to ease your sister's entrée to adulthood. This may translate into something that looks like favoritism, but it actually reflects the time and energy they've spent reviewing your upbringing and what they wish they'd done differently for you.\n\nThere's also a good chance your parents' financial situation has improved in the last 12 years, saving steadily despite having the same jobs they've always had. Parenting philosophies tend to align with a family's financial means. For instance, if I have money to spend on the new Nike sneakers that all the cool kids at school are wearing, I'll build a whole case in my mind around my kid's self-esteem to justify buying them. However, if I don't have the money to do so, I suddenly have no interest in raising materialistic conformists. Perhaps your parents valued self-sufficiency when you were coming of age, due to their financial constraints at the time, but now value stability and provision, given they can afford it.\n\nUnderstanding an explanation, however, doesn't mean the changes your parents have made for your sister don't hurt you, or that you need to spare your parents' feelings about their impact on you. As you alluded to, talking about these things is the best way to keep ourselves from falling out over them.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean you need to have a huge, emotional conversation about it, however. Instead, the dialogue should take the form that best suits your goals. If you want your parents' financial support to pay off your remaining college debt, I suggest approaching the conversation seriously. Schedule the discussion in advance, and during the meeting, focus on your financial need and only mention your sister's situation as the reason you felt you could ask. Don't accuse your parents of favoritism or dwell on your hurt feelings.\n\nYou could say something like, \"You mentioned paying for my sister's tuition the other day, and I'm so glad you're able to do that. I remember how stressful it was for me to work and take out loans during college. I understand that our family's financial situation was different back then, and I don't blame you for it. However, now that you're in a more stable position, I was wondering if you could help cover some of my education costs as well, since I still have a lot of college debt.\" This way, the comparison speaks for itself without putting your parents on the defensive.\n\nHowever, if you've accepted the way things are, but would like to address the hurt you feel, I wouldn't schedule a whole conversation for it. I would simply start talking about it as it comes up — even joking about it, Nate Bargatze-style. For instance, when I texted my mom to get a quote about parenting her youngest very differently than her older children, I didn't offer a qualifier or soften my reasoning for why she might be an expert on the topic. She knows I feel this way because when my sister dyed her hair blue at 15, I reminded everyone that when I came home from college at 19 with a cartilage piercing, Mom made me take it out.\n\nYour family will likely recognize the real sense of injustice behind your jokes and comments. Sure, it may annoy them, and it will absolutely annoy your sister, but there's nothing wrong with gently telling your truth. Your parents have changed their parenting style without apology; this is your honest response.\n\nI only gave my mom 10 minutes to respond with a quote because I was on a deadline, after all. She didn't argue the past; she explained it. Because we all know how it was. We make allowances for one another's humanity — my entitled demands for quotes, her evolving her parenting style, which I couldn't reap the benefits of. To me, that's the real proof of loving families like mine and yours; we can handle the truth because we know what we share is bigger than all of it. We keep these loving relationships strong by not holding resentment or anger inside, but instead addressing those feelings as honestly and constructively as we can.\n\nLooking for advice on how your savings, debt, or another financial challenge is affecting your relationships?

    "fullText": "The parents of a college football cheerleader found dead have filed a $1 million lawsuit.\n\nBrianna Aguilera, a 19-year-old college football cheerleader, was found dead in Austin, Texas during rivalry weekend. The college student was found dead at the bottom of an apartment complex. The Austin Police Department suggested that Aguilera took her own life, though the cheerleader's mother strongly disagreed.\n\nStephanie Rodriguez, the mother of the deceased cheerleader, ripped Austin Police for their investigation.\n\n“Please don’t believe this lazy investigator and Investigation!” Stephanie Rodriguezwrote on Facebook.\n\nNow, the parents of the cheerleader have filed a $1 million lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against Austin Blacks Rugby Club and the University of Texas’ Latin Economics and Business Association. The seven-figure lawsuit accuses the two school organizations of allegedly serving their daughter alcohol before her death.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Aguilera was served her first drink around 6 p.m. She was allegedly continued to be served drinks for several hours, before stumbling away. Aguilera ended up at an apartment where she was supposed to spend the night. Ultimately, she fell to her death around midnight.\n\n“We believe even more today this was not a suicide as has been suggested by police. This was either an accident or something much more sinister,” Tony Buzbee, lead attorney with the Buzbee Law Firm, who is representing Aguilera’s parents, said at a press conference.\n\nHe added: “If the police department will not do its job, then we will do it for them.\"\n\nThe police said that they found a deleted suicide note on Aguilera's phone. However, attorneys representing Aguilera's family say that it was just a drafted essay.\n\nAn official cause of death has yet to be released. An investigation into the death remains to be underway.",

    "fullText": "Jan. 8 (UPI) -- Carson Beck took a deep breath and delivered a simple message to Miami teammates Thursday before leading a game-winning drive against Ole Miss and clinching a spot in the College Football Playoff finale:\n\n\"We've got three minutes for the rest of our lives.\"\n\nThe sixth-year quarterback finished the Hurricanes' final drive with his first rushing score since September. The 3-yard run, which came with 19 seconds remaining, lifted the Hurricanes to a 31-27 Fiesta Bowl victory and into their first national title game since 2003.\n\n\"I'm so proud of this team,\" said Beck, who threw for 268 yards and two scores. \"We never flinched in the face of adversity. When we had to respond, we responded.\"\n\nCARSON BECK TAKES THE LEAD FOR THE CANES IN THE NICK OF TIME pic.twitter.com/5ZuJlwISkX— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) January 9, 2026\n\nThe No. 10 Hurricanes (13-2) and No. 6 Rebels (13-2) exchanged the lead six times, including four times in the fourth quarter of the electric College Football Playoff semifinal in Glendale, Ariz. Neither team led by more than seven points.\n\nBeck's Hurricanes, who dominated time of possession in the first half, nearly unraveled due to dropped passes, penalties and an overall lack of discipline down the stretch, but found chemistry when it mattered most.\n\nThey will battle the top-ranked Indiana Hoosiers or No. 5 Oregon Ducks, the other two semifinalists, for a chance to claim their sixth national crown.\n\n\"We are focused on enjoying this one, but we've gotta get focused on going 1-0 one more time,\" Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal said.\n\nThe Hurricanes out-gained the Rebels 459 to 398 in total yards and held an edge in time of possession of nearly 22 minutes, but also committed 10 penalties and logged the game's lone turnover.\n\nPowerful Hurricanes trench play, with dominant defensive and offensive line performances, muted Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and the Rebels' previously potent offense throughout the first two quarters.\n\nCarter Davis split the uprights for a 38-yard field goal on the Hurricanes' first drive of the night for the only points of the first quarter. Rebels running back Kewan Lacy then gutted the Hurricanes defense with a career-long 73-yard touchdown run 10 seconds into the second quarter.\n\nBut Lacy, who picked up a hamstring injury, didn't see another carry in the first half. Hurricanes running back CharMar Brown scored on a 4-yard run to end the next drive.\n\nRebels kicker Lucas Carneiro tied the score with a 42-yard field goal on the next possession, but the Hurricanes answered with their second score of the night. That score -- a 52-yard pass from Beck to wide receiver Keelan Marion -- and an extra point gave a 17-10 lead for the Hurricanes.\n\nCarneiro made a 58-yard kick just before halftime to cut the deficit to four points at the break.\n\nDavis and Carneiro each missed 51-yard kicks on the first two drives of the second half. Rebels safety Kapena Gushiken snatched a deflected pass for an interception of Beck on the next possession.\n\nCarneiro hit the left upright and bounced in another three points for the Rebels about three minutes later, trimming the deficit to 17-16.\n\nThe Rebels unearthed their pass rush at the start of the fourth quarter, picking up two sacks on the Hurricanes' first drive of the frame. They then put together their longest drive of the night, using 14 plays to get another Carneiro field goal and take back the lead with about seven minutes remaining.\n\nFreshman phenom Malachi Toney took momentum back when he caught a short pass from Beck on the next drive and revved for a 36-yard touchdown, helping the Hurricanes take a 24-19 advantage.\n\nBut Chambliss used his legs and live arm to wrestle back the advantage less than two minutes later. The Rebels quarterback threw a 24-yard dart to tight end Dae'Quan Wright for that score. He followed with a successful two-point conversion throw to wide receiver Caleb Odom for a 27-24 edge with 3:13 remaining.\n\nBeck responded by using 14 plays to get the Hurricanes to the Rebels 3-yard line. He took the next snap, scanned through progressions to his right and darted to a clear patch of grass on his left before finding the end zone with his clutch gallop.\n\nChambliss used the game's final seconds to march the Rebels deep into Hurricanes territory, but his final pass dropped incomplete as time expired.\n\nThe Rebels quarterback completed 23 of 37 passes for 277 yards and a score in the loss. Beck completed 23 of 37 passes for the Hurricanes, including seven completions to Marion, who totaled a game-high 114 yards.\n\nToney amassed 81 yards on five catches, including his touchdown. Hurricanes running back Mark Fletcher Jr. ran for 133 yards on 22 carries. Lacy totaled 103 yards and a score on 11 carries, with the majority of his production coming from his career-long sprint.\n\nOregon (13-1) will meet Indiana (14-0) in the second College Football Playoff semifinal at 7:30 p.m. EST Friday in Atlanta. The winner will face the Hurricanes in the national title game Jan. 19 in Miami Gardens, Fla.",

    "fullText": "Betting on himself pays off in a heartbeat. And Carson Beck’s decision to stay in college football for one more season turns golden as Miami heads to the CFP finals with a 31–27 win over Ole Miss. This is their first championship berth since 2001, and all thanks to Beck’s last-minute game-changing TDs that turned things around. Now, Beck sums up the moment like a hero.\n\n“We never flinched,” Miami quarterback Carson Beck said after the game. “We, I mean, in the face of adversity, when we had to respond, we responded. You could just see it in their eye. You could see it in their eye. We all had a good feeling that what just happened was about to happen.\n\n“I actually went in drive, and you were trying to loosen them up by some right before you drove it down for the win. I told them, we got three minutes for the rest of our lives, bro. No shit else matters, alright? I don’t mean to cuss. Emotions are rolling, but nothing else matters. We got three minutes to go do this, man.”\n\nCarson Beck scrambled for a three-yard rushing touchdown with 18 seconds left, sending Miami past Ole Miss. Something that he later calls “the best feeling I ever had in my life.” The game swung wildly in the fourth quarter as Ole Miss brightly took control of the game.\n\nQuarterback Trinidad Chambliss connected with Wright on a 24-yard touchdown pass to put the Rebels ahead 27-24 with 3:13 minutes remaining. Despite that, Beck steadies the Hurricanes, calmly leading the game-changing drive.\n\nThe post Carson Beck Reveals Last 3 Minute Moment Before Historic Miami Touchdown appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLane Kiffin may no longer be on the Ole Miss Rebels' sideline, but as the team continues its College Football Playoff run, he remains a central talking point.\n\nThe coach's controversial move to join the LSU Tigers at the end of Ole Miss' regular season, just before his team was about to begin preparations for the CFP, was the biggest story of the 2025 coaching cycle in college football. And despite Kiffin no longer coaching the Rebels, he is able to continue financially benefiting from his old team's playoff victories.\n\nLanguage in Kiffin's LSU contract allows him to still receive the bonuses for playoff success he would have received from Ole Miss had he stayed at the school.\n\nHere's what to know about how much Lane Kiffin makes from Ole Miss' CFP wins.\n\nMORE: Which Ole Miss assistants followed Lane Kiffin to LSU?\n\nThe Advocate reported that Kiffin agreed to a seven-year deal, $91 million deal in Baton Rouge, which also has opportunities to earn more via incentives. Additionally, language in Kiffin's contract reportedly requires a raise from LSU to make him the highest-paid coach in the country if he wins a national championship.\n\nIn the deal, LSU committed to paying any bonuses Kiffin would have received during Ole Miss' playoff run, per ESPN.\n\nKiffin is reportedly set to make $13 million annually, making him one of the highest-paid coaches in college football. Georgia's Kirby Smart is the only coach who makes more annually, based on reported figures.\n\nKiffin's Ole Miss salary in 2025 was exactly $9 million, per USA Today, which made him the 11th highest-paid head coach in college football. Kiffin signed a six-year extension worth $54 million in 2023 with Ole Miss.\n\nMORE: The highest paid coaches in college football\n\nLSU included language in Kiffin's new contract that allows him to financially benefit from when his former team, Ole Miss, wins playoff games. When Ole Miss beat Tulane in the first round of the CFP, Kiffin received $250,000, per Front Office Sports. And he received $500,000 after Ole Miss upset Georgia to reach the semifinals.\n\nDepending on how far Ole Miss advances, Kiffin could receive plenty more from the Tigers.\n\nHere is the structure of how much Kiffin receives for Ole Miss CFP wins, per Front Office Sports:\n\n$150,000 for advancing to the first round of the CFP\n\n$250,000 for appearing in the quarterfinals\n\n$500,000 if Ole Miss advances to the semifinals\n\n$750,000 if Ole Miss advances to the national championship\n\n$1 million if Ole Miss wins the title\n\nMORE: When does LSU play Ole Miss in 2026?",

    "fullText": "Miami Madness: How Hurricanes won CFP semifinal thriller against Ole Miss originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIs the College Football Playoff now the College Football Tournament?\n\nThat's how this feels now. The CFP is the CFT – and that is how the ACC is back in the championship game. \"January Madness\" doesn't have the same ring to it.\n\nWhat about \"Miami Madness\"? It's here.\n\nHow else can you explain how the Hurricanes will play for the College Football Playoff championship on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.? No. 10 Miami created that with a thrilling 31-27 victory against No. 6 Ole Miss in the College Football Playoff semifinal at Vrbo Fiesta Bowl on Thursday.\n\nQuarterback Carson Beck – a sixth-year senior transfer from Georgia – high-stepped into the end zone with a 3-yard touchdown run with 18 seconds remaining. That was the score in a back-and-forth with Ole Miss star quarterback Trinidad Chambliss in a 25-point fourth quarter that resembled the final minutes of a March Madness thriller.\n\nIt wasn't over until Chambliss' desperation pass into the end zone between Ethan O'Connor and Zechariah Poyser fell incomplete. There was no late flag this time.\n\nMiami (13-2) beat Ole Miss (13-2), and now faces the winner of the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl between No. 1 Indiana (14-0) and No. 5 Oregon (13-1).\n\nIs this how the 12-team College Football Playoff is going to work? Do you love it?\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nOle Miss kicker Lucas Carneiro took center stage in CFP\n\nWhat is next for Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss?\n\nThe Hurricanes had +2700 odds to win the national championship coming into the CFP as the “bubble team.” Miami was on the outside looking in through most of November, but they leap-frogged No. 11 Notre Dame in the final set of rankings as the last at-large team in the field.\n\nThe Hurricanes watched five-loss Duke win the ACC championship game against Virginia, but the Hurricanes were the team the conference campaigned for to get into the field. By no coincidence, ACC commissioner Jim Phillips could be seen on the sideline Thursday wearing an orange-and-white tie. This is a huge win for the conference made better by knocking the SEC out of the field.\n\nMORE: SEC lags behind in bowl standings\n\nThe Hurricanes have pulled off upsets against Texas A&M and Ohio State, then won the thriller against Ole Miss to keep the momentum going. They will be underdogs again against the Hoosiers or Ducks. So it could be argued that Miami – the program with five national championships – is your realistic College Football Playoff version of a Cinderella.\n\nMiami led 17-13 at halftime – but it felt like the Hurricanes should have led by more. The Hurricanes out-gained the Rebels 228-145, ran 19 more offensive plays and controlled time of possession at 22 minutes and 14 seconds compared to Ole Miss at seven minutes and 16 seconds.\n\nThe Hurricanes made those little plays that made a difference. Miami faced a third-and-8 in the second quarter. Beck fired a short pass to receiver Malachi Toney, who stepped out of the tackle by Suntarine Perkins and picked up the first down.\n\nThe Hurricanes turned that into a 4-yard TD run by CharMar Brown with 7:23 left in the half. Beck hit a wide-open Keelan Marion for a 52-yard TD on the next drive. Ole Miss countered that with a pair of field goals from Lucas Carneiro from 42 and 58 yards, respectively, for the 17-13 halftime score.\n\nThe Hurricanes tried to give it back in the second half. Miami defensive players dropped four interceptions in the game and had a series of head-scratching penalties. Ole Miss had a 24-19 lead before Toney took a screen pass from Beck for a 36-yard TD with 5:04 remaining for a  24-19 lead.\n\nOle Miss got the ball back with 5:04 remaining, and Chambliss continued his heater that led the Rebels to a 39-34 victory in the Allstate Sugar Bowl. Chambliss threw a 24-yard TD pass to Dae'Quan Wright with 3:13 remaining for a 27-24 lead. Miami answered with a 15-play, 75-yard drive led by Beck, who finished 23 of 37 for 268 yards, two TDs and one interception.\n\nChambliss – who finished 23 of 37 for 277 yards and a TD – nearly led the Rebels to the CFP championship game. This was the team whose coach Lane Kiffin took the LSU job at the end of the regular season. Yet an instant classic that had four lead changes ended with Miami going home for the national championship.\n\nThis would only add to the \"Madness.\" Consider that since 2014, only one men's basketball team that held the No. 1 overall seed going into the NCAA Tournament has won the national championship. That was No. 1 UConn, which won back-to-back national titles. The previous season, the Huskies beat No. 5 Miami in the Final Four.\n\nWere those Hurricanes under Jim Larranaga any more of a long-shot than the ones on the football field that have burned through No. 7 Texas A&M and No. 2 Ohio State – the defending national champion – before beating the Rebels on Thursday?\n\nMiami's defense has injuries. A defense that had 12 sacks in the first two rounds with Rueben Bain Jr. had just one sack against the Rebels. Yet Miami coach Mario Cristobal has found a way to push this team into the championship game with a patient running game – Miami had 51 rushing attempts while Ole Miss had 21 with Mark Fletcher Jr. totaling 22 carries for 133 yards – and Beck is now 37-5 as a starter.\n\nThey'll be in their backyard too, the unintended home-field advantage that will come with a list of Miami icons watching from the sidelines. Did anybody think this was possible when the Hurricanes played their final home game in the regular season against NC State on Nov. 15 before five straight wins away from home?\n\nThere is only one word for that.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOle Miss players likely didn’t spend their College Football Playoff run wondering what former coach Lane Kiffin was up to or what he had to say, but the rest of the college football world has had just about no escape from Kiffin since he bolted for LSU in November.\n\nThe highly paid coach has long been active on social media, even amid a tumultuous few weeks that saw him leave Oxford for Baton Rouge, and he followed Ole Miss’ journey to the semifinals every step of the way.\n\nAfter the Rebels lost a thrilling Fiesta Bowl on Thursday night and saw their run come to an end, Kiffin reacted on X.\n\nHere’s a look at what Kiffin had to say about his former team and the officials after Ole Miss was eliminated.\n\nMORE:Why Lane Kiffin left Ole Miss for LSU\n\nKiffin tweeted a broken heart gif after Ole Miss' defeat, but he praised the Rebels for \"amazing effort and grit\" despite the loss.\n\n\"Best season ever in the history of Ole Miss!!\" Kiffin said, certainly remembering that he was part of it for the first 12 games.\n\nOnce the dust settled, though, Kiffin had a bone to pick with the officials for their decision not to call a penalty on the final play of the game.\n\nKiffin argued De'Zhaun Stribling was interfered with on Ole Miss' Hail Mary attempt at the end of the fourth quarter, with replay showing Stribling grabbed by a defender and at least partly pulled down.\n\nPass interference 💯!!! https://t.co/99jrGosJ5w\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) January 9, 2026\n\nPass interference calls are generally rare on Hail Mary attempts because of the amount of hand fighting that is naturally part of a scrum, but some on Ole Miss' side — including coach Pete Golding, who gestured toward the officials when the clock struck zero — believed Miami put the Stribling at enough of a disadvantage to necessitate a penalty.\n\nMORE:Explaining the no-call at end of Fiesta Bowl\n\nWhile Miami will play on, Ole Miss' loss might be some final closure on what became a months-long saga with Lane Kiffin at the center. Kiffin and LSU will focus on the 2026 season, while Golding will get the chance to fully prepare for his first season at Ole Miss once he finds out whether Trinidad Chambliss will be his quarterback.",

    "fullText": "Sample of roughly 500 posts shows how frequently people are creating sexualized images with Elon Musk’s AI chatbot\n\nNew research that samples X users prompting Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok demonstrates how frequently people are creating sexualized images with it. Nearly three-quarters of posts collected and analyzed by a PhD researcher at Dublin’s Trinity College were requests for nonconsensual images of real women or minors with items of clothing removed or added.\n\nThe posts offer a new level of detail on how the images are generated and shared on X, with users coaching one another on prompts; suggesting iterations on Grok’s presentations of women in lingerie or swimsuits, or with areas of their body covered in semen; and asking Grok to remove outer clothing in replies to posts containing self-portraits by female users.\n\nAmong hundreds of posts identified by Nana Nwachukwu as direct, nonconsensual requests for Grok to remove or replace clothing, dozens reviewed by the Guardian show users posting pictures of women including celebrities, models, stock photos and women who are not public figures posing in snapshots.\n\nSeveral posts in the trove reviewed by the Guardian have received tens of thousands of impressions and come from premium, “blue check” accounts, including accounts with tens of thousands of followers. Premium accounts with more than 500 followers and 5m impressions over three months are eligible for revenue-sharing under X’s eligibility rules.\n\nIn one Christmas Day post, an account with more than 93,000 followers presented side-by-side images of an unknown woman’s backside with the caption: “Told Grok to make her butt even bigger and switch leopard print to USA print. 2nd pic I just told it to add cum on her ass lmao.”\n\nA 3 January post, representative of dozens reviewed by the Guardian, captioned an apparent holiday snap of an unknown woman: “@grok replace give her a dental floss bikini.” Within two minutes, Grok provided a photorealistic image that satisfied the request. Other posts in the trove show more sophisticated employment of JSON-prompt engineering to induce Grok to generate novel sexualized images of fictitious women.\n\nThe data does not cover all such requests made to Grok. While content analysis firm Copyleaks reported on 31 December that X users were generating “roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute”, Nwachukwu said that her sample is limited to just more than 500 posts she was able to collect with X’s API via a developer account. She said that the true scale “could be thousands, it could be hundreds of thousands” but that changes made by Musk to the API mean that “it is much harder to see what is happening” on the platform. On Wednesday, Bloomberg News cited researchers who found that Grok users were generating up to 6,700 undressed images per hour.\n\nNwachukwu, an expert on AI governance and a longtime observer of and participant in social media safety initiatives, said that she first noticed requests along these lines from X users back in 2023.\n\nAt the time, she said, “Grok did not oblige the requests. It wasn’t really good at doing those things.” The bot’s responses began changing in 2024, and reached a critical mass late last year.\n\nIn October 2025, she noticed that “people were putting Halloween attire on themselves using Grok. Of course, a section of users realized we can also ask it to change what other people are wearing.” By year’s end, “there was a huge uptick in people asking Grok to put different people in bikinis or other types of suggestive clothing”.\n\nThere were other indications last year of an increased willingness to tolerate or even encourage the generation of sexually suggestive material with Grok.\n\nIn August, xAI incorporated a “spicy mode” setting in the mobile version of Grok’s text-to-video generation tool, leading the Verge to characterize it as “a service designed specifically to make suggestive videos”.\n\nNwachukwu’s data is just the latest indication of how the platform under Musk has become a magnet for forms of content that other platforms work to exclude, including hate speech, gore content and copyrighted material.\n\nOn Friday, Grok issued a bizarre public apology over the incident on X, claiming that “xAI is implementing stronger safeguards to prevent this”. On Tuesday, X Safety posted a promise to ban users who shared child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Musk himself said: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”\n\nNwachukwu said, however, that posts like those she has already collected are still appearing on the platform. Musk is giving “the middle finger to everyone who has asked for the platform to be moderated”, she said. The billionaire slashed Twitter’s trust and safety teams when he took over in 2022.\n\nShe added that other AI chatbots do not have the same issues.\n\n“Other generative AI platforms – ChatGPT or Gemini – they have safeguards,” she said. “If you ask them to generate something that looks like a person, it would never be a depiction of that person. They don’t generate depictions of real human beings.”\n\nThe revelations about the nonconsensual imagery on X has already drawn the attention of regulators in the UK, Europe, India, and Australia.\n\nNwachukwu, who is from Nigeria, pointed to a specific harm being done in the posts to “women from conservative societies”.\n\n“There’s a lot of targeting of people from conservative beliefs, conservative societies: west Africa, south Asia. This represents a different kind of harm for them,” she said.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Ole Miss Rebels sit just two wins away from their first national championship in school history. Ole Miss’ playoff run has been surprising, as the team played most of the season without its head coach, Lane Kiffin.\n\nOver the past two months, Ole Miss navigated Kiffin leaving for LSU while installing a new head coach, Pete Golding. Despite the distractions, the team is 2-0 in the College Football Playoff, marking its first-ever postseason berth.\n\nLet’s take a look back at Kiffin’s dramatic decision to leave Ole Miss for LSU.\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal\n\nKiffin leaving Ole Miss for LSU was a weeks-long, drawn-out saga that only exists in a sport like college football. According to reports, Kiffin was lured away from Ole Miss with a massive NIL budget the Rebels could not match, among other perks.\n\nThe move was officially announced by LSU on Nov. 20, 2025, ending weeks of speculation and drama.\n\nMORE: A look at some of Lane Kiffin's early transfer portal losses in 2026\n\nLSU fired Brian Kelly on Oct. 26. Just a few weeks later on Nov. 17, Kiffin emerged as the Tigers' sole focus in their coaching search. In the days that followed, Kiffin's family was seen taking visits to Baton Rouge, as well as Gainesville, for the open Florida job.\n\nWhile Ole Miss reportedly wanted an answer from Kiffin on his future that week, the decision continued to drag on. The school reportedly gave Kiffin an ultimatum to make a decision before the Egg Bowl on Nov. 28, which Kiffin denied.\n\nAs his team was preparing for the Egg Bowl against Mississippi State, Kiffin declined to discuss his future during media availability. He did, however, reiterate how happy he was in Oxford.\n\nLane Kiffin: \"I love it here. It's been amazing and we're in the greatest run in the history of Ole Miss at this point... I'm just living in the moment.\"\n\n— Bryan Fischer (@BryanDFischer) November 19, 2025\n\n%3Cscript%20async%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.twitter.com%2Fwidgets.js%22%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E\n\nI asked Lane Kiffin if he expects to coach the Egg Bowl.\n\n\"Why would I not expect to coach next week? … We're gameplanning, we just practiced. I don't even understand how that would happen.\"\n\n— Chris Vannini (@ChrisVannini) November 19, 2025\n\nOn Nov. 20, a week before the Mississippi State game, Kiffin had a meeting with Ole Miss AD Keith Carter. Although a resolution or formal announcement was expected to come from it, Carter released a statement saying that a formal announcement would come after the Egg Bowl:\n\nLet’s lock in and focus on keeping the Golden Egg! pic.twitter.com/5xPfDozhl2\n\n— Keith Carter (@KeithCarterOM) November 21, 2025\n\nAlthough there were plenty of distractions surrounding Ole Miss in the days leading up to the Egg Bowl, the game was an important one. With a loss, Ole Miss was likely out of the CFP entirely. Although Kiffin didn't address his future, he did discuss the noise surrounding the program in the recent days:\n\n\"This noise ... this has been going on for weeks. This isn't new for us.\"\n\nLane Kiffin on the rumors swirling about where he'll coach next season 👀\n\n(via @SECNetwork)pic.twitter.com/hHJ6AIlHCA\n\n— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) November 28, 2025\n\nOle Miss defeated Mississippi State 38-19. After the game, Kiffin told ESPN sideline reporter Taylor McGregor that he was still unsure about what he was going to do about his future and that he would have \"a lot of praying\" to do as he made his decision.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon following the Egg Bowl, Kiffin met with the Ole Miss AD again. Although LSU remained 'very confident' it was going to land Kiffin, the prolonging of a decision put things slightly in doubt.\n\nIn the evening hours, LSU reportedly finalizing its deals with Kiffin was delayed by Ole Miss' playoff hopes. It was later reported that Kiffin wanted to finish the season with Ole Miss through its playoff run, while simultaneously threatening to poach players if he could not.\n\nCBS Sports later confirmed reports of Kiffin threatening to take players and staff to LSU with him:\n\nThe Ole Miss coach wasn't going to leave for Baton Rouge without a fight, though. In a conversation described as tense, Kiffin didn't want to back down from his desire to coach the team through the postseason.\n\nWhen Ole Miss showed no interest in allowing him to do so, Kiffin, according to sources, threatened to take the offensive staff with him immediately if Carter and Boyce didn't relent. They held firm; Kiffin would not be coaching the team in the playoff.\n\nAs word of Kiffin's tactics spread, multiple Ole Miss football players confronted him in his office Sunday about it. Kiffin refused to directly answer whether he had told his on-field offensive staffers that if they didn't get on the plane with him to Baton Rouge the next day, they wouldn't have a spot on his LSU staff.\n\n\"I'm not making them go,\" Kiffin told the players. \"They can do whatever they want.\"\n\nSunday morning on Nov. 30 still had plenty of drama. A 9a.m. central time team meeting Kiffin had scheduled was pushed to 1 p.m.. By 3 p.m. Eastern, Kiffin made it official with an announcement via X:\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) November 30, 2025\n\nGreeted with boos and middle fingers from Ole Miss fans, Kiffin boarded a private plane to Baton Rouge. During an interview with ESPN's Marty Smith, Kiffin stated that although he wanted to coach the team through the playoff, he respected the school's decision\n\nMy interview with @Lane_Kiffin prior to his departure from Oxford to Baton Rouge.\n\n•Why he chose LSU over Ole Miss\n•Why he wasn’t in Sunday’s Ole Miss team meeting\n•His response to not coaching Ole Miss in the playoff\n•Why this took so long\n•Peter Carroll’s important msg pic.twitter.com/GfBkE7fnHU\n\n— Marty Smith (@MartySmithESPN) December 1, 2025\n\nEven after Kiffin was officially introduced at LSU, he touched on his tough decision to leave Ole Miss, as well as his desire to coach the Rebels through the playoff.\n\n\"Extremely difficult decision,\" Kiffin said in his introductory presser at LSU the following Monday. \"In that, we tried every single thing possible to continue to coach the team through the playoffs and to continue to coach the players. In the end that was their decision, and we totally respect that and appreciate the time and energy that we tried to figure out a plan to do the best thing at the time for those players.\"\n\nKiffin leaving Ole Miss didn't come as much of a surprise. LSU, one of the best college football jobs in the country, has the type of talent and resources that Ole Miss simply cannot match. In his presser, Kiffin added that he relied on mentors like Pete Carroll, who channeled his father, Monte Kiffin.\n\n\"I felt like everybody that I talked to outside of the state that I was in all basically said the same thing, Kiffin said. \"They all said, man, you are going to regret it if you don’t take the shot and you don’t go to LSU. It’s the best job in America with the best resources and to win it. It’s obviously been done here before by a number of people.\n\n\"Pete Carroll, really he told me that he always told my dad that he would look out for me. When we were talking, he really channelled him from knowing him for so long, and he said, this is exactly what he would do. He would tell you, boy, go get it; go for it.\"\n\nAlthough several Ole Miss assistants followed Kiffin to Baton Rouge, including offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr., running backs coach Chris Smith and linebackers coach and tight ends coach Joe Cox, only a few are remaining with the team through Thursday's Fiesta Bowl.\n\nPer ESPN on Jan.6, Weis Jr. and Smith are expected to continue coaching Ole Miss against Miami on Thursday evening. Other assistants that followed Kiffin like Cox and receivers coach George McDonald are expected to stay behind.\n\nMORE:Ranking the four remaining 2025 College Football Playoff\n\nLane Kiffin signed a seven-year, $13 million contract with LSU, which will earn him close to $91 million. His new salary makes him one of college football's highest-paid head coaches, right there with Georgia's Kirby Smart.\n\nOle Miss reportedly was set to match LSU's reported offerings around $13 million a year, but it's unclear if the numbers matched LSU's exactly.\n\nKiffin's salary in 2025 was right at $9 million per USA Today, which made him the 11th highest-paid head coach in college football. According to the Clarion Ledger, Kiffin signed a six-year extension worth $54 million in 2023 with Ole Miss.\n\nAlthough the numbers for 2025-26 aren't public just yet,  LSU reportedly also is set to commit $25-30 million per year for roster-building with Kiffin.\n\nA 2024 estimate had Ole Miss' roster from last season costing $10 million. You can guesstimate that number is higher for big-name stars like Trinidad Chambliss, Kewan Lacy and others, but it's nowhere close to LSU's reported commitment under Kiffin.\n\nKiffin compiled a 55-19 overall record in six seasons at Ole Miss, and he left as the school's third winningest head coach.\n\nMORE: Bowl season winners & losers",

Originally from Grand Rapids, Mich., Chambliss was an unrated recruit coming out of high school and started his college career at Ferris State due to a lack of Division I offers.\n\nHe spent four seasons under longtime Ferris State coach Tony Anesse, although he was the team’s starter for only one season. Here’s a look back at Chambliss’ Ferris State career before arriving at Ole Miss.\n\nMORE:How Trinidad Chambliss went from Ferris State to SEC's 2025 breakout star\n\nTrinidad Chambliss played DII football at Ferris State. The program is led by head coach Tony Annese, who first arrived at the program in 2012. He's taken the program to new heights, including back-to-back national titles in 2021 and 2022, and two other consecutive national championships in 2024 and 2025, the latter of which was won by Chambliss under center.\n\nOver his 13 seasons with the Bulldogs, Annese has compiled an impressive 153-21 record. He has also helped Ferris State take home seven GLIAC titles, including its first since 1999. The Bulldogs also reached the national title game in 2018.\n\nMORE: What do Ole Miss fans mean when they say \"Hotty Toddy\"\n\nFerris State is located in Big Rapids, Mich., about 56 miles north of Grand Rapids, where Chambliss grew up. In high school, Chambliss played both basketball and football for Forest Hills High School in Grand Rapids. As a senior in 2020-21, he helped lead his basketball team to a state semifinal appearance.\n\nHe signed with Ferris State’s class of 2021 but didn’t see significant playing time until his junior season in 2024.\n\nMORE:More on Trinidad Chambliss' Michigan roots\n\nChambliss became the Bulldogs' starter in 2024, and helped lead Ferris State to a national title. He threw for 2,925 with 26 touchdowns and just six interceptions, and Ferris State defeated Valdosta State 49-14 in the title game. Chambliss threw three touchdowns passes and rushed for another two in the win.\n\nChambliss was part of two national championship teams as a backup quarterback in 2021 and 2022. He led Ferris State to its third national title in four seasons as the starter in 2024.\n\nFerris State's strong reputation has continued since Chambliss left for Ole Miss. The 2025 Bulldogs finished as national champs with a perfect 16-0 record, capped off with a 42-21 win over Harding in the national title game.\n\nMORE:Meet Pete Golding, the man that replaced Lane Kiffin at Ole Miss\n\nAlthough he received an influx of interest from schools after winning a national title for Ferris State in mid-December 2024, Chambliss didn't enter the winter transfer portal window.\n\nBut as more schools started reaching out and offering him life-changing NIL opportunities in the spring, he saw it as an opportunity he couldn't pass up. He entered the spring transfer portal window—which has since been limited by the NCAA to just one window in January—in April 2025. He committed to Ole Miss and the Rebels a couple of weeks later.\n\nHe even began the 2025 season behind Ole Miss quarterback Austin Simmons but earned the starting job after Simmons got injured in Week 3. He's thrown for a career-high 3,660 yards with 21 touchdowns and three interceptions at Ole Miss.",

    "title": "A gap year program is lining up six-figure startup salaries for teens",
    "description": "Common Gap links high school graduates to paid jobs at startups as an alternative to attending college.",
    "fullText": "The college application season is well underway, and high school seniors are facing some big decisions. Chief among them: What about a gap year?\n\nNow, a new program wants to formalize that path. Common Gap, launching Thursday, aims to match ambitious teens taking a year off before or during college with startup jobs.\n\nDelaying, dropping out of, or skipping college altogether have long been popular in Silicon Valley. Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Larry Ellison have all done some version of it. As artificial intelligence hype draws young founders to San Francisco, programs at companies like Palantir Technologies are rolling out anti-college initiatives for high school graduates. Meanwhile, startup entrepreneurship programs like Y Combinator skew increasingly younger, as taking a gap year has become less contrarian and more mainstream for aspiring technocrats.\n\nAs part of Common Gap's program, participating startups must agree to pay the high school graduates at least $75,000 a year. Oliver Zhou, the founder of the initiative, expects most offers will exceed $100,000. Common Gap doesn't have its own funding, since the participating companies will pay the students' salaries, and it won't turn a profit.\n\nZhou sees early-career prospects as a major unlock in the AI talent race, which last summer sent offers for the most technical machine learning roles into the millions: \"Why wait for them to graduate?\" He told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nZhou, 24, wishes he had taken a gap year. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania a year early and founded Deep24, a Y Combinator-backed startup that analyzes productivity data to help users manage their time effectively, in 2024. He also previously worked as a product manager at Uber.\n\n\"If you choose to go to college, you're going very intentionally,\" he said of those who will complete the Common Gap.\n\nCommon Gap takes its name from the Common App, a platform used by college-bound students to apply to over 1,000 schools with one application.\n\nPrograms for early-career techies aren't necessarily new. The Thiel Fellowship, founded in 2011, awards early-stage founders $200,000 and requires participants to drop out of college. Some venture capital firms, like Kleiner Perkins, have programs like the Common Gap, which matches college students with internships at startups in their portfolios.\n\nSeveral startups have already signed on with Common Gap, including Austin-based SuperBuilders, which makes technology for Alpha School, an AI-powered private school. Many other partners are AI-focused — a health tech company, an insurance startup, and Zhou's Deep24. His company and others in Common Gap went through the Silicon Valley entrepreneurship program Y Combinator. Zhou is working on programming for participants who will work at San Francisco-based startups.\n\nThe application process will skip the traditional résumé drop and instead asks applicants to share \"the most impressive thing you've done or built,\" Zhou said, with an optional video interview component. Zhou is also considering using AI as an initial filter in early interview rounds.\n\n\"I certainly think that college is not right for everyone, and it has kind of become a default,\" he said. \"Being able to do real work, rather than just turning in assignments for someone to grade, is quite rewarding — and good learning.\"",

Is it only when a team loses, or does a Cinderella run end when the Cinderella becomes favored?\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes have sprung two upsets already in the College Football Playoff, but they are now favored against the Mississippi Rebels in the first semifinal.\n\nMy Miami vs. Mississippi predictions and college football picks lean heavily on Cinderella, even if Cinderella is now favored.\n\nKickoff comes at 7:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, January 8.\n\nThe thought of Miami reaching the national championship game after its questionable inclusion in the College Football Playoff should make Notre Dame fans and BYU fans livid. Yet, here we are.\n\nThe Hurricanes’ defense is distinctly the best unit in this game, and it is playing at its best of the season. Meanwhile, the Rebels’ offense is losing assistants with each round of the Playoff, courtesy of former head coach Lane Kiffin.\n\nThat matchup should dictate this game, lending itself to a Miami win and a continued Cinderella-ish run.\n\nMississippi may have the best offensive line that Miami has faced yet in the Playoff, but with how defensive ends Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor are playing, that should not matter. Furthermore, Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss is less of a scramble threat than Texas A&M’s Marcel Reed and less adept at getting rid of the ball under pressure than Ohio State’s Julian Sayin.\n\nExpect the Miami Hurricanes’ defensive front to make Chambliss look like a Division II quarterback while Miami’s offense enjoys facing the worst defense it has seen in the Playoff.\n\nMiami's offense might not look outright good in this matchup, but it should look better than it has yet in the Playoff. This is the worst defense it has faced thus far. Furthermore, shortening the game with a heavy dosage of Mark Fletcher Jr. will only help the Hurricanes' defensive front.\n\nMark Fletcher Jr. Over 88.5 rushing yards\n\nMalachi Toney anytime touchdown\n\nAny Miami faith should also go hand in hand with the Under. Handing off to Mark Fletcher Jr. will help keep Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss off the field; it will also keep the Hurricanes' defensive line more aggressive.\n\nMark Fletcher Jr. Over 88.5 Rushing Yards\n\nSpread: Miami -3.5 | Mississippi +3.5\n\nMoneyline: Miami -164 | Mississippi +138\n\nOver/Under: Over 51.5 | Under 51.5\n\nMiami is 2-0 against the spread this season as a one-score favorite and 4-1 ATS as a one-score favorite in the last three seasons.

Now, the CEO of the world’s biggest talent company, Randstad, has confirmed what many young grads are already fearing: The traditional college-to-office pipeline is dead.\n\n“People need to reflect on—taking a student loan, going to college and being trained or educated for a profession that is rapidly changing—whether that’s still the right path,” Sander van ’t Noordende, the global CEO of Randstad, told Fortune.\n\n“We all grew up, with our parents saying, ‘go do something in college or university and then do something in an office,’ that path that used to work for a long time is starting to break,” he added.\n\n“You already see that with the graduates finding it harder to find a job. You see that in professions like marketing, communications, design… just look at how good AI already is at some of that.”\n\nUnder his helm, the staffing company places around half a million workers in jobs every week—and he has bad news for those who have already forked out thousands for their degree in the hopes of nabbing a cushy office role: You may have more luck landing bartending, barista, or building jobs.\n\nTech leaders have consistently warned that AI is already as good as entry-level workers and that it could halve white-collar jobs by 2030. In fact, a “first-of-its-kind” Stanford University study has warned that the new technology is already having “significant and disproportionate impact” on Gen Z. Bartenders and baristas are even seeing bigger pay raises than desk workers, right now.\n\n“Jobs will change—and are changing—but also new jobs will emerge,” van ’t Noordende echoed. “There is a massive demand in skilled trades, mechanical engineers, machine operators, maintenance engineers, forklift drivers, truck drivers—you name it.”\n\nWith the white-collar job market seemingly frozen, van ’t Noordende said it’s no longer “good advice” to tell young people to follow their passions.\n\n“No, learn a craft or a trade or a skill or a profession, where you can make a good living and provide for you and your family, is much better advice than follow your passion.”\n\nFurther making his case: The U.K. government has just announced it’ll be splurging $965 million into apprenticeships to help place tens of thousands of unemployed young people into the jobs that they think are the future—and they’re all in hospitality, retail, and AI.\n\nBut for those hell-bent on going to college, van ’t Noordende stressed that STEM subjects—which are studied in China at twice the rate of the U.S. and parts of Europe—will likely remain in demand.\n\nAnd his advice to those who’ve already wasted time and money on a degree that’s dwindling in relevance? “Retrain. Learning new skills always good.”\n\n“Look around you, and where you see the opportunities that match with your skills and your background and go there,” van ’t Noordende added. But he warned that at some point, you may just “have to bite the bullet and say, ‘Okay, this is not working.’”\n\nThe CEO stressed that you’re not alone; many people are currently doing exactly that. And that ultimately, going from a desk job to becoming a plumber, teacher, or nurse, van ’t Noordende says, requires a mindset shift. It’s not a failure if you end up doing work outside your field of study—it’s just adjusting to what actually works. “You have to come off your chair and build skills,” he added.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "I developed stabbing stomach pain as a college football player. It turned out to be stage 4 colon cancer.",
    "description": "Khalil Smith thought he was just training hard and adjusting to college life. It turned out his stabbing stomach pains were a result of colon cancer.",
    "fullText": "It felt like someone was stabbing me in the stomach.\n\nAt the time, there were plenty of halfway reasonable explanations why my stomach might be hurting. Maybe it's a cold. Maybe I have the flu. Maybe this is just me getting used to college food. Or maybe I just got punched in the stomach a few too many times.\n\nI was a 19-year-old freshman running back at West Virginia Wesleyan College. Living away from home, training hard, studying, there were bound to be reasons why my stomach hurt. Except this hurt just wouldn't go away.\n\nFor more than six months, I was living with a strange kind of persistent, stabbing pain that would return again and again through the course of the day. It didn't seem to matter if I popped a Tums or changed what I ate. It's hard to put food down when it feels like you're being consistently pummeled from the inside. The pain got so bad that I was subsisting on a diet of little more than chocolate milk and mixed fruit from the dining hall.\n\nI knew I was getting skinnier, but I thought, \"Hey, that's what training hard can do.\" It's not uncommon to lose a little weight during football season.\n\nIt wasn't until the springtime, after I'd turned 20, that I realized how serious the weight loss had gotten. My friends and I were home messing around, cracking jokes, and jumping on the scale to see who'd lost and gained weight since college started. I stepped on the scale, and it registered 155 pounds. I had lost 30 pounds in half a year. That's when my dad called the doctor and made sure I got an appointment the next day.\n\nAfter a few visits, doctors discovered I was bleeding internally, and I was sent to the hospital for tests, including a colonoscopy. They couldn't even get the camera through my colon during the exam, because it was completely blocked. Later on, doctors told me my tumors were as big as a pineapple. Five pounds worth, and two of them had broken open and were spreading.\n\nI had stage four cancer — it was aggressive, and it was traveling throughout my body.\n\nHow could this be happening? I was a young college athlete, just out of high school, and a pretty healthy guy. How could I have late-stage colon cancer?\n\nBut I did. And I'm not alone. More and more, doctors are diagnosing young people with late-stage, aggressive colon cancers like mine, occurring decades earlier than what's \"normal,\" and catching everyone by surprise.\n\nGetting cancer felt like getting my free will ripped away from me. I lived in the hospital, underwent major surgery, got my insides stripped out, and then had a colostomy bag put in temporarily to deal with my waste. It was isolating, and I felt like I was living in a different universe.\n\nAfterwards, once the colostomy bag was removed and I was able to go to the bathroom on my own again, I had to get a physical therapist just to re-learn how to do the simple things in life. Things that weren't easy to me anymore included getting up, using the toilet, or having the ability to just move around the way I used to.\n\nOn top of that, I was outfitted with a port for chemotherapy infusions, lost my hair, and dealt with how those toxic treatments completely sap your energy.\n\nAnd yet, even after all the treatment was over, doctors were still finding more cancer in my body. They did one more major surgery, put in another temporary colostomy bag, and tried a new kind of chemotherapy. Six more months of treatment. The cancer still wasn't eradicated. At this point in time, I'd done two major surgeries and 12 rounds of chemo, and the doctors were still telling me, \"Well, we have to do another surgery and a different type of chemo.\"\n\nMy faith in my oncologist was waning, my frustration mounting. I'm thinking: You keep telling me if I do these things, I'm going to be all right, and it's going to be gone, but it's the same cycle over and over again. I was starting to feel like a test patient.\n\nThat's when, with some help from my football coaches, I sought a second opinion out of state. Finally, I was tested for Lynch syndrome, the genetic condition sometimes called \"cancer family syndrome\" or \"hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\" because of how it predisposes people to several kinds of cancers, but especially colon cancer, usually in their 40s and 50s.\n\nOnce I had my proper diagnosis, the disease became easier to treat. Oncologists have recently discovered how well Lynch syndrome responds to immunotherapy, where you recruit your own immune system to recognize and fight cancer, sometimes without any need for toxic radiation or chemotherapy.\n\nI went back to my doctor again, who agreed to take a different approach and do immunotherapy this time, with no chemo required. The difference was amazing. Instead of lying in bed all day, exhausted, I was able to live a relatively normal life during this round of treatment. I wouldn't say my energy was 100%, but maybe 80%, which is a really major improvement from life during chemo.\n\nI not only felt better, but I was also getting better. Doctors were able to stop my immunotherapy treatments completely in mid-2024, and I've been all clear since then.\n\nI still get scans about every three months. I know I'll have to be vigilant; my condition puts me at a lifelong higher risk of developing cancer because the mutations that are built into my DNA make it easier for the disease to sprout up.\n\nSchool was my much-needed dose of normalcy through all of the cancer treatment. I told myself I was still going to graduate on time, even if I couldn't be an athlete. My doctors suggested taking a break to heal, and while I understood where they were coming from, I just knew for my own mental health I had to maintain at least some of the \"normal\" things in life while I was a cancer patient. It helped me stay motivated, knowing that at least I could still graduate on time, even if I couldn't play football.\n\nI also kept on working out, getting in regular exercise throughout my treatments. Even when I was getting chemotherapy infusions, I'd strap on a bag to let the chemo drip into me while I moved around, and head to the track for three to five miles of walking. Some days I could only walk very slowly, others it was a brisk pace, depending on my energy. I think the movement really helped manage the side effects, making them milder. Even though I did have some symptoms, and chemo was rough, I felt like keeping my body active and getting that blood flowing and moving around was so beneficial.\n\nAfter two years off the field, with a clean bill of health, I returned to the football team my senior year. It felt good to be back on the field, but my body was not the same anymore.\n\nI have issues with neuropathy, a type of treatment-related nerve damage that makes my hands and feet tingle and go numb. This makes me hyper-sensitive to cold temperatures, making it hard to drive a car when it's cold out or even open up the freezer and pull something out. It's kind of hard to catch a football when you can't really feel your hands, or run when your feet are numb. Eventually, I decided it was time to quit the sport I love, but it felt good doing it on my own terms, and playing for one last season.\n\nI still work out almost every day, but it's not the same as having a team sport. I've started some personal training, training people who were inspired by how well I recovered and how much muscle I was able to build back after my treatments.\n\nI have also changed my diet. After living with a colostomy bag a few times and seeing exactly what comes out of your body after you eat, you start to think about food differently. Some of that stuff is not being digested at all, especially the artificial colors in brightly colored cereals. I don't eat as much junk food or cereal as I used to, in part because seeing those bright blue, purple, and green colors coming out of my body scared me straight. I try to stick to a diet that's good for muscle building and longevity, mainly focusing on lean proteins like chicken and fish, plus lots of leafy greens, with room for a little bit of red meat now and then to keep my iron levels up, but not as much as I used to eat.\n\nI hope my story can be helpful to others going through cancer treatment. I have run a few clothing drives, and donate to my local hospital just so cancer patients like me can have snacks and blankets, comfortable stuff while they're waiting around.\n\nI know how it can feel when your family is going through such a hard time. It's always good to have somebody see you, someone who has experienced it, to help you get through a tough time.",

    "title": "Couch: Lansing Community College's nationally ranked women's basketball team has reloaded, with one goal",
    "description": "The No. 9-ranked Stars bolstered their schedule and expanded their talent base in an effort to achieve the goal that's eluded them the last two years.",
    "fullText": "LANSING — For Lansing Community College’s women’s basketball program, the previous two seasons were a combination of wonder and winning, building and bonding. The rebirth of the Stars’ program under Megan Hudson has been an awesome story.\n\nBut it’s also twice finished in frustration and heartbreak, back-to-back 25-win seasons ending a win shy of the NJCAA Division II national tournament.\n\nAll you have to do is look at the schedule and the roster this season to know there’s one goal: Get to the national tournament.\n\n“100%. It’s eyes on the prize,” Hudson said, midway through her third season.\n\n“I mean, it’s everything,” said sophomore point guard Claire Tobias, from Holt.\n\nThe Stars are 11-2 entering Wednesday night’s home game against Jackson College (5:30 p.m., Gannon Gymnasium). Jackson beat them in the district championship two years ago. LCC then begins conference play at home Saturday against Glen Oaks Community College (1 p.m., Gannon Gymnasium).\n\nThe LCC men, also off to a good start (9-4), host Mott at 7:30 on Wednesday and Glen Oaks at 3 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThat non-conference record by the LCC women has been earned this season. Hudson challenged her team in ways she hadn’t the first two years — playing three straight ranked teams in three days at a tournament at St. Clair County in November, beating two of them and losing a competitive game to now-No. 2 Illinois Central, then playing at No. 6 Schoolcraft, losing by four, before winning three games at an event in Florida in December, including over No. 12 Parkland.\n\nAll of it has put the Stars firmly on the national radar, ranked No. 9 nationally in the latest poll, which came out Tuesday.\n\nIt’s the respect Hudson has been seeking. “Because I feel the basketball we’re playing is on that level,” she said.\n\n“I have been trying to figure out the formula for national competition, to continue to grow, to get to a space that we can make the national tournament and, when we get there, we can compete nationally,” Hudson continued. “And it was clearly articulated to me that you need to travel to play outside of your region and you have to play ranked teams.”\n\nShe was told that by fellow coaches and, not in so many words, by the NJCAA tournament selection committee, which didn’t give the Stars one of the few at-large bids when they fell to Schoolcraft last March in their district championship game.\n\nHudson also knew that she needed to challenge this particular team early, a squad with 10 freshmen.\n\n“I knew that I had a very young team coming in, a very, very talented young team coming in,” Hudson said, “and that they need to understand what that landscape looks like, and to play the best of the best and to be able to compete at that level.”\n\nHudson’s team still has a local flare to it — Tobias, sophomore post Ashlynn Putman (Mason), redshirt-sophomore Ivana McCollum (Waverly), along with freshmen guards Sophie Klinger (East Lansing) and Jocelyn Kotowicz (St. Johns) are all regular contributors, with Tobias and Putman starting all 13 games.\n\nBut Hudson’s recruiting reach has expanded significantly — to Detroit, Flint, Bay City, Berrien Springs, Kansas, Texas.\n\nThe foundation and culture built the last two seasons has made LCC an attractive destination and the recruiting pitch easier.\n\nFor example, transfer Destiny Ochs, a 5-foot-9 wing from Topeka, Kansas, found LCC on her own, first by poking around the NJCAA website.\n\n“Lansing stood out to me,” Ochs said. “I looked them up, and the school popped out to me. I could tell they're really focused on their education, they looked like they had a good basketball program they were building. And I just looked at their Twitter, too. And I saw that they're committing a lot more girls. It’s more of a diverse team than it was last year. So I was just really interested. I reached out from there.”\n\nHudson emailed her back the next day and the recruitment blossomed.\n\nFreshman power forward and center Aubreona Smith — affectionally known to her teammates as “Smitty” — met Hudson after one of her games at Berrien Springs. There were a number of coaches there to see her, but she and Hudson connected right away.\n\n“She stood out the most to me,” Smith said. “I feel like you should go somewhere you’re wanted and not just be a number.”\n\nShe liked that LCC had a psychology program and felt like home. And, “I like to win.”\n\nThis is no longer just a dream. Nor just a feel-good story. Hudson has something to sell, proof of concept, and can be choosy in who she recruits, as well.\n\nHer first two teams were talented in their own right. This one is deeper — 13 deep regularly.\n\n“I have easily seven different kids that could go off for 20 (points) on any given night,” Hudson said.\n\n“We have so many guards this year, they just love to run,” Tobias added. “We have so many people coming off the bench, if one person's tired, we have another one just as fast. We outrun everyone. I love that feeling, as someone who just loves to push the ball up (the court). … And Smitty coming in, her and Ash (Putman) being our bigs have been great.”\n\nSmith are Putman are part of a balanced scoring attack, with Putman leading the team at 11.3 points per game (an 8.2 rebounds), with Smith at 10.8 (and 7.8 rebounds). Armonie Smith, a 5-9 freshman guard from Flint, averages 11.2 points, with freshman guard Demi Bolton, who played at Ferndale, at 9.1 per game. Tobias averages 7.6 points and team-leading 2.4 assists. Freshman Georgia Kuyers — who followed former LCC star Kara Bartels (now at CMU) from Zeeland West — is averaging 6.7 rebounds in 17.3 minutes. Nine players are averaging 15 minutes or more per game, with Putnam and Tobias the only two over 20.\n\n“I think our athleticism and the fact that we can go so deep in the roster, that's been a little bit different. … That's helped us this year,” Putman said.\n\nAlso helping — even when it doesn’t feel like it: the travel and the schedule.\n\n“I think it was necessary,” Putman said. “It was hard at times, and obviously we dropped a couple (games) to the Illinois (Central) team and Schoolcraft. But playing the high-caliber teams early and getting a feel for that early, I think is beneficial for us when we go down the road and play at regionals and nationals.”\n\n“We we feel like we have figured out the recipe a bit on getting the girls ready for what that's going to feel like in a different way than we have in the past,” Hudson said, “what it feels like to play multiple games back to back, what it feels like to be in high-pressure situations and make better decisions, and you don't get that if you're not playing the best.”\n\nAs the goal has become more focused, Hudson and her staff have tried to make sure this is still an inviting program and an atmosphere that isn’t entirely about winning under pressure. For example, they take dance breaks during workouts — where one player teaches the rest of the team a dance. They give each other verbal flowers after every practice. It’s still a mom and pop operation, too — literally. Hudson’s mother, Pat Feehery, buys the team snacks.\n\nAt the community college level, there’s always a ton a newness. Maintaining culture and leadership comes down to the staff and your sophomores.\n\n“I've been very, very pleased with our (group),” Hudson said, also happy that her team posted a 3.3 first-semester GPA, the highest in her time with the program. “The sophomores have been outstanding, major anchors to what we're doing here. The freshmen, to have the mentality they have, is fun to see.”\n\nContract Graham Couch at gcouch@lsj.com.
