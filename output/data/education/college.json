    "fullText": "The second weekend of December provided us with one of the best two-day stretches of the young 2025-26 men’s college basketball season so far.\n\nHere are the 10 teams that got the biggest boosts from the mid-December madness that just transpired.\n\nThe Johnnies had no problem with Iona in a 91-64 win that had special meaning to head coach Rick Pitino. After being essentially exiled from the sport following his dismissal at Louisville, Pitino was thrown a lifeline by Iona in 2021, and then led the Gaels to two NCAA Tournament appearances in three seasons.\n\n“Iona’s got a really good team,” Pitino said after the game. “Iona’s such a special place with great tradition. I owe them so much. We’re going to play this game every year that I’m the coach.”\n\nThe Buckeyes avoided what would have been a big hit to their early NCAA Tournament resume by roaring back from a 16-point second half deficit (regardless of what the tweet below says) and taking down West Virginia in double overtime.\n\nThese are the types of games and moments that are easy to gloss over in the dead of December, but often ultimately decide the last teams in or out of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nConference realignment might have ruined the football version of “Bedlam,” but props to the basketball programs for carrying the torch.\n\nLike Ohio State, Oklahoma really needed this win to keep a “ok, not great” early season resume before diving head first into a conference play gauntlet. The Sooners exploded for 13 made three-pointers to win their fourth consecutive game over Oklahoma State.\n\nYes, Kentucky finally got a win over a team with a pulse, but perhaps more importantly, the Wildcats avoided a loss that felt like it had the potential to push Big Blue Nation over the edge.\n\nThe Wildcats had been the most disappointing team in college basketball through the season’s first six weeks. The fan base did not love the way Mark Pope handled his first real dose of adversity. A home loss to a hated rival that every member of the UK program has looked down at for the entirety of their existence would have created a blue Christmas across the Commonwealth.\n\nIn his first game back from injury, Mo Dioubate was the ultimate difference-maker for Kentucky. The power forward transfer from Alabama scored 14 points and pulled down a season-high 12 rebounds in his first game action since Nov. 13. That’s a huge boost for a team that was in desperate need of one.\n\nThe Broncos continue their early recovery from one of the worst opening night losses in the history of college basketball, their 79-78 defeat at the hands of Division-II opponent Hawaii Pacific. Since then, Boise has taken two far more understandable losses (USC and NC State in Maui) and has knocked off Wichita State, Butler, and now Saint Mary’s in a 68-67 thriller on Sunday.\n\nSt. Mary’s gets a chance with 7 seconds left but an untimely slip from Joshua Dent spoils their plans and Boise State pulls off the upset 68-67 pic.twitter.com/H4vIDduLqA\n\n— NCAA Buzzer Beaters & Game Winners (@NCAABuzzerBters) December 15, 2025\n\nSuddenly, Boise State finds itself inside the top 40 at No. 39 in the latest NET Rankings. That’s the second-best ranking of any team from the Mountain West, trailing only No. 30 Utah State.\n\nThe Mountain West is down this season, so Boise will need to be near-perfect in conference play to have a shot at an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. Thanks to Sunday’s win, though, there is at least a path.\n\nThe Zags got the better of modern rival UCLA in a late-night neutral court battle in Seattle. Graham Ike’s 28 points and overall inside dominance proved to be the biggest difference, as Mark Few’s team withstood a strong shooting performance from the Bruins’ Tyler Bilodeau to win, 82-72.\n\nIf Gonzaga is able to take care of Oregon this Sunday, they’re almost certain to begin play in their final season as a member of the West Coast Conference with just one defeat (a 40-point blowout against Michigan in the Players Era Festival championship game). A gaudy overall record, a top 3 national seed, and a 752nd national debate over whether the Zags are actually good enough to win the national championship appears to be on the horizon for yet another March.\n\nIt’s nice for college basketball to have at least a few unvarying North Stars during this period of overwhelming change.\n\nIt feels a little wrong to call Kansas a “winner” after a weekend where star freshman Darryn Peterson was forced to leave the team’s game at NC State after appearing to aggravate the hamstring injury that has been bothering him since the beginning of the season. Still, the Jayhawks got a miraculous performance from Melvin Council Jr. as they outlasted the Wolfpack, 77-76 in overtime.\n\nCouncil, who said afterwards that the most three-pointers he’d ever made in a game at any level was “two or three,” buried a whopping nine triples and netted a career-high 36 points to keep KU from dropping its fourth game before Christmas.\n\nThe issue with Peterson — who reportedly said on Monday that his issue during the game wasn’t hamstring related — is still of significant concern, but this was a win that Kansas really needed to get in order to round out its non-conference resume. The Jayhawks now have a pretty light slate until the middle of January, which will hopefully give the superstar freshman ample time to heal whatever needs healing.\n\nAre the Razorbacks the best team in the SEC? They’re certainly playing like it.\n\nArkansas notched its second top 20 win in two weeks with a 93-86 triumph over No. 16 Texas Tech Saturday afternoon in Dallas. The win was extra sweet considering it came eight months after the Red Raiders eliminated John Calipari’s team from the NCAA Tournament with a soul-crushing overtime comeback in the Sweet 16.\n\nThe difference for Arkansas against Tech was the continued uptick in production from forward Trevon Brazile. The versatile 6’10 senior hit 4 of his 5 three-point attempts and scored 18 of his team-high 24 points in the second half to help the Razorbacks overcome a double-digit deficit. Brazile also added 10 rebounds.\n\nThe performance of Brazile, coupled with 20-point efforts by both Darius Acuff and Karter Knox, lifted Arkansas to victory despite a 30-point, 11-rebound effort from Texas Tech All-American JT Toppin.\n\nArkansas has one major test — a neutral court showdown against No. 7 Houston on Saturday — remaining before the start of conference play.\n\nBefore this weekend, Arizona already had the best resume in college basketball and a team that appeared fully capable of winning the program’s second national championship.\n\nNow, Tommy Lloyd appears to have unlocked the full potential of 5-star freshman Brayden Burries. That’s not great news for the rest of the Big 12.\n\nBurries, the No. 9 overall player in the 2025 recruiting class according to 247 Sports, averaged just 7.8 points in Arizona’s first five games this season, and didn’t score more than 5 points in the team’s spotlight wins over UConn, Florida and UCLA. Against Alabama on Saturday, the 6’4 shooting guard exploded for a career-high 28 points as the Wildcats stomped No. 12 Alabama in Birmingham, 96-75.\n\nBurries, who hit five three-pointers and was 11-of-19 from the field overall, scored 15 points in four minutes during a game-defining stretch in the second half. For a team whose lone weakness this season had seemed to be outside shooting, the Burries performance proved that Arizona can win big games in virtually any way it needs to.\n\nWith the win over ‘Bama, Arizona is now the first team in 30 years to have five wins over AP top 25 opponents in its first nine games of a season.\n\nNebrasketball secured the best start in the history of the program (11-0) with easily its most impressive win of the season (and arguably the most impressive win of the Fred Hoiberg era), with a thrilling 83-80 road triumph over No. 13 Illinois.\n\nJamarques Lawrence’s game-winning three just before the buzzer also gave us one of the best moments of the first month and-a-half of the season, and nearly killed Cornhusker play-by-play man Kent Pavelka in the process.\n\n41-year Nebraska basketball play-by-play announcer Kent Pavelka’s (@KentPavelka) call of Jamarques Lawrence’s game winning 3 is GOLD 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/Vofj6HyU1E\n\n— NCAA Buzzer Beaters & Game Winners (@NCAABuzzerBters) December 14, 2025\n\nWe also got this on-court view of the game-winner and resulting celebration via injured Cornhuskers guard Connor Essegian.\n\nTHE CRAZIEST THING I’VE EVER RECORDED. GAME TIME🔥👀 pic.twitter.com/9hbDYNeXms\n\n— Connor Essegian (@CEssegian) December 13, 2025\n\nThe ending was dramatic, but this was no fluke result. For 40 minutes, Nebraska — who had yet to notch a truly head-turning victory or play a true road game before Saturday — was the better team. They led Illinois by as many as 14 points in the first half and by as many as 10 in the second.\n\nLawrence got all the glory, but it was Pryce Sandfort and his career-high 32 points that did the most damage for the Huskers in Champaign. Rienk Mast added 17 points and 7 boards.\n\nWith the combination of their 11-0 start and last season’s championship in the inaugural College Basketball Crown post-season tournament, Nebraska has now won 15 consecutive games. That’s both the longest streak in program history and the longest active streak in men’s college basketball.\n\nInfamously, Nebraska is the only power conference program to have never won a game in the NCAA Tournament. Suddenly, it seems like we might very well be just a few months away from that not-so-fun fact disappearing from the Huskers’ resume forever.",

    "title": "After years of losing myself and my female friendships, I got divorced. Now, I've built a life I love with my best friend.",
    "description": "When I got married, I lost touch with my best friend from college. After my divorce, we went on a life-changing trip and decided to become roommates.",
    "fullText": "\"I don't want to go back,\" said Katie, my best friend of 20 years, from across a café table in Cape Town. A tear slid down her cheek.\n\nWe were two single women traveling 8,000 miles from our respective homes — hers a one-bedroom apartment in New York City, and mine a two-story house in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIt was the last day of a two-week girls' trip and the longest stretch we'd spent together since college.\n\nNow, the reality of returning to a life that would rip us apart again was setting in, and our hearts were breaking simultaneously.\n\nI felt invincible again. So, why did it have to end? Sitting in that sunny café, we decided it didn't.\n\nSaying that Katie and I \"met\" in college feels like a gross understatement. Both in need of a roommate, we were set up by mutual friends who swore we were the perfect fit. They were right.\n\nWe became inseparable from the second we stepped into our tiny dorm room as freshmen, and for the next four years, we were a package deal: Liz and Katie. Katie and Liz.\n\nSomehow, we balanced each other perfectly. I was the short blonde, always a bit too eager to break the rules. Katie was the tall brunette who was more methodical when it came to pushing the limits.\n\nTogether, we proved to be unstoppable, and our adventures were endless.\n\nAfter graduation, we made our way to Manhattan. Eventually, I was living with a boyfriend in a cramped but happy studio apartment, and Katie lived across town.\n\nOn my 28th birthday, my partner surprised me with a proposal. Blindsided yet in love, I said yes.\n\nFor six years, I did what a \"good\" wife does: holidays with my husband, trips with my husband.\n\nI even moved states with him, leaving Katie for a house in a small town. It was his dream, not mine.\n\nSome say marriage is like two becoming one, but for me, I was torn into pieces. Not only did I lose myself prioritizing someone else's needs over my own, but I lost my female friendships.\n\nThrough the years, I canceled countless plans and declined dozens of invitations for girls' trips. As a result, Katie and I became distant. Soon, she had a serious boyfriend I'd never met and new friends who didn't even know my name.\n\nThat's when I began restlessly circling through a cookie-cutter neighborhood I hated, avoiding my home and husband, in what felt like total darkness. Finally, I decided not to return to either.\n\nMy husband and I separated, and I spent the end of my 30s in therapy to learn how to honor my own needs. It was not quick, but eventually, I became a friend to myself — and, in turn, the friend I felt Katie deserved.\n\nStanding on my own two feet in the life I wanted, I called my best friend from six states away to say the words that I'd wanted to for so long: \"How about we take a girls' trip?\"\n\nSix months later, Katie and I flew to South Africa.\n\nWe adventured on safari and up Table Mountain. We sipped wine in vineyards and sat on beautiful beaches.\n\nAfter two weeks together, it felt as if two decades of friendship had been renewed in ways we never could have imagined.\n\nI realized that somewhere along the way, I'd fallen for the idea that success for a woman is finding someone to marry. Katie had too, likening being unmarried to failure.\n\nIt took a divorce for me to realize I already had a partner for life. We could choose to be single and still be supported.\n\nInstead of returning to separate homes, Katie and I hatched a plan to be roommates again. Twenty years after moving into that tiny dorm room, we upgraded to a three-bedroom house big enough to hold all the lessons we'd gathered in the decades between.\n\nLiving together, we don't have to wait to take on adventures anymore. Somehow, it feels like they find us around every corner, whether it's an unexpected connection, a new love interest, or simply a chance to laugh.\n\nThe world is ours again: Liz and Katie. Katie and Liz.",

    "description": "Trump is expanding short-term credential programs through the Workforce Pell grant, while the debate over the value of a college degree continues.",
    "fullText": "The four-year college degree no longer has the same pull it once did — and the Trump administration agrees.\n\nThe Department of Education concluded its negotiations on the Workforce Pell program on December 12, a new initiative included in President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nThe program would extend Pell grants to low-income borrowers in short-term certification programs, with the intention of providing more funding for alternative paths to a four-year college degree or trade school.\n\nNicholas Kent, the department's undersecretary, acknowledged during remarks at the beginning of negotiations that a standard four-year college degree is losing its value.\n\n\"Americans are questioning whether the value of higher education is worth the cost. Polling also shows that students do not believe they are graduating with the specific skills that they need,\" Kent said. He added that skepticism about college degrees has led to students \"showing more interest in pathways that get them into the labor force more quickly and without unnecessary debt.\"\n\nCollege still remains the primary path in the US for postsecondary education, and recent data from the New York Federal Reserve showed that it continues to lead to higher earnings. In addition, proponents argue the value of college extends beyond earnings to social opportunities and exposure to new ideas.\n\nHowever, high student debt loads and a growing number of jobs eliminating degree requirements have sparked a growing interest in short-term credential programs and the trades, which the Trump administration is attempting to boost.\n\nChris Madaio, a senior advisor at the nonprofit The Institute for College Access and Success, told Business Insider that with more Pell grant support extended to short-term programs, it's likely that more schools will offer them and more students will enroll.\n\n\"I think it's all ensuring that students take what's right for them,\" Madaio said. \"These programs should pay off for students, and they should give a good value and use students' limited lifetime Pell grant eligibility for something that's going to work for them and potentially allow them to get a job later down the road.\"\n\nThe Department of Education's Workforce Pell proposal will have a period of public comment before it is set to be implemented in July 2026.\n\nIf the rule is implemented as proposed, eligibility guidelines would vary by state. According to the department, each state will determine what qualifies as a high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand job based on what aligns with the industry needs in that state. For example, a state where agriculture dominates the economy might choose to prioritize short-term programs in that field.\n\nMadaio said that this state variance is by design: \"It's really important that states are taking a close look at what they're approving to ensure that there are jobs in that state and that these are valuable workforce training programs for jobs that are needed in that state.\"\n\nAccountability is key here, Madaio said, and states should ensure that schools are delivering on the value of the programs they offer. Otherwise, students could be left paying off loans they cannot afford — and that's something that the gainful employment rule, which the department is set to negotiate in January, will address.\n\n\"These are really positive developments that show that there's a broad agreement across the political spectrum that we owe it to students to make sure that the programs that they're investing in are going to provide a quality education and that they're going to get something out of it,\" Carolyn Fast, director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider.\n\nSome high schools across the country are working to shift the emphasis away from a four-year college as the only option. Business Insider previously visited a public high school in rural Wyoming, for example, that works to equip students for college, career, or the workforce, giving students the freedom to choose the path that best suits their interests.\n\nOverall, the higher education financing landscape is undergoing significant changes. In addition to the negotiations on Workforce Pell and gainful employment, the Department of Education recently concluded negotiations on a repayment overhaul that condenses the number of existing repayment plans, replacing them with less generous options that could lead to higher payments and shorter timelines to debt relief for student-loan borrowers.\n\nAs the slew of higher education changes takes effect, Madaio said that students should expect to see more advertising for short-term programs that are funded by grants. He recommended that students closely examine the actual costs of a program and its outcomes to avoid predatory behavior by schools.\n\n\"A critical piece is for students to do their homework when deciding on a certificate credential program, and then consider what kind of jobs they can get for that, and are those things that they need the training for?\" Madaio said.",

    "description": "Gottlieb played college basketball at Brown and said she had a teammate whose daughter had to shelter in place in a library basement.",
    "fullText": "USC women’s basketball head coach Lindsay Gottlieb opened her postgame news conference after the No. 16 Trojans’ loss to No. 1 UConn on Saturday night with her thoughts on the mass shooting that took place at Brown University.\n\nProvidence police said Sunday morning that they had detained a person of interest after two people were killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting on campus during finals. The person is in their 30s. The shooting happened in an engineering building on campus as people in the area were told to shelter in place for hours afterward as police looked for the shooter.\n\nGottlieb played basketball at Brown and said that she checked her phone after the game to see many text messages about the shooting. She said she felt she needed to address the shooting because it was more important than basketball and that “we can all be better.”\n\n“It doesn’t need to be this way,” Gottlieb said. “Sending thoughts and prayers to my teammates who have kids there. To the parents that have to worry about their children, I’m just going to end it with that, but just to say we’re the only country that lives this way. The college football cycle has been in the news a million times and are we going to report about this? It’s the guns. We’re the only country that lives this way. Parents should not be worried about their kid — I have a teammate who has a daughter who is in the basement of a library because they don’t know what’s going on there. And she’s flying there tomorrow.\"\n\nPolice said the shooter had a handgun and fired more than 40 rounds during the incident. The mayor of Providence, Brett Smiley, said that the building’s outside doors were unlocked but that access to the classrooms where exams were taking place required a badge.\n\nGottlieb has been USC’s coach since 2021 after she spent two seasons as an assistant for the Cleveland Cavaliers following her time as Cal’s head coach. She played at Brown from 1995-99 and immediately got into coaching after her collegiate playing career was over.\n\nUSC lost 79-51 at home to UConn on Saturday night as the Trojans play the season without injured star JuJu Watkins. She injured her knee in the 2025 NCAA tournament before USC fell to UConn in the Elite Eight a season ago. Watkins, who suffered a torn ACL, will miss the entire 2025-26 season.",

Shortly after he won college football’s highest honor, the brand paid tribute.\n\nAdidas released a video honoring Mendoza after he won the Heisman on Saturday night. The brand paid homage to his viral quote following the Big Ten Championship when the IU quarterback told FOX Sports’ Jenny Taft, “The Hoosiers are flippin’ champs.”\n\nThroughout the year, Mendoza not only became one of the biggest stars on the field, but one of the top names in the sport.

He is the latest college football star to partner with the Three Stripes, joining Ohio State receiver Jeremiah Smith and Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola, among others.\n\n“Excited to share that I’ve accepted an opportunity to join adidas!” Mendoza wrote in a LinkedIn post. “I’m very grateful for everyone who has supported me along the way and excited to bring my passion for sport, leadership, and work ethic to the Three Stripes. Let’s get to work.”\n\nMendoza led the nation with 33 touchdown passes this year while completing 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards, to just six interceptions. Additionally, his $2.6 million On3 NIL Valuation ranks No. 5 in college football and No. 7 in the On3 NIL 100, the first of its kind and defacto NIL ranking of the top 100 high school and college athletes ranked by their On3 NIL Valuation.\n\nFernando Mendoza beat out Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia for the award, garnering 643 first-place votes and 2,362 points. Pavia got 189 first-place votes and 1,435 points. It’s the latest chapter in a special season for the former Cal star, who helped lead Indiana to its first outright Big Ten title since 1945.\n\nAfter the announcement, Mendoza delivered a passionate speech. As he wrapped, he had a message for young athletes who think they’re not getting enough attention or are ranked high enough.\n\n“The truth is, you don’t need the most stars, hype or rankings,” Mendoza said. “You just need discipline, heart and people who believe in you. And you need to believe in your own abilities. I hope this moment shows you that chasing your dreams are worth it, no matter how big or impossible they seem.”",

    "description": "Our Memphis vs. Louisville predictions expect the Tigers to cover on Saturday.",
    "fullText": "The No. 11-ranked Louisville Cardinals host the Memphis Tigers in college basketball action on Saturday.\n\nThe Cardinals are an offensive powerhouse and sit as 15.5-point favorites, but my Memphis vs. Louisville predictions think the spread is a tad too wide.\n\nSee why with my college basketball picks for this non-conference clash on December 13.\n\nMemphis vs Louisville best bet: Memphis +15.5 (-105)\n\nThe Louisville Cardinals entered this season with national title aspirations and have rolled to an 8-1 record. After losing their first game of the season at No. 17 Arkansas last week, they bounced back with an 87-78 win against Indiana.\n\nThe Cardinals launch threes at the highest rate in the nation and knock them down at a 36% clip. They're also highly efficient inside the arc and sit in the Top 50 in turnover rate. That said, their stock is at a sell-high point making this line a tad too wide.\n\nThe Memphis Tigers got off to a poor start this season, losing four of their first five games. However, they've gone 7-1 against the spread this season and are trending in the right direction. They're now on a three-game win streak and are fresh off a 78-71 win against Baylor.\n\nFormer five-star recruit Aaron Bradshaw had averaged just 10.8 minutes per game through his first contests with his new school. However, the center has logged 15.5 points in 21.0 minutes per game over his last two contests.\n\nMeanwhile, Louisville's five-star guard Mikel Brown has struggled with his shot after a great start to his college career. The freshman is shooting just 30.8% from the field and 19.5% from the arc over his last five games.\n\nWhen the Tigers faced Purdue (then the No. 1 team in the country) in Nassau three weeks ago, they were 14.5-point underdogs. They were neck-and-neck until the five minutes before the Boilermakers pulled away for a nine-point win.\n\nExpect the Tigers to keep things within a big number against a highly-ranked opponent again.\n\nWhile I'm betting on Memphis to cover this big spread, I still think Louisville is the far better team and will get the win at home.\n\nIf the Tigers want to cover this spread, they need to make sure Louisville doesn't go ballistic from deep. Brown has knocked down fewer than 2.5 threes in four of his last five games.\n\nThe Cardinals have been elite on offense but aren't as good on the other end of the floor. That combined with their blazing-fast pace can lead to inflated offensive numbers for their opponents.\n\nThat's good news for Memphis point guard Dug McDaniel who has dropped more than 5.5 dimes in six of eight games this season.\n\nLouisville center Sananda Fru has grabbed fewer than 7.5 boards in seven of his last eight games.\n\nSpread: Memphis +15.5 (-105) | Louisville -15.5 (-115)\n\nMoneyline: Memphis +950 | Louisville -1700\n\nOver/Under: Over 160.5 | Under 160.5\n\nThe Tigers are 7-1 ATS this season.

    "title": "I'm an entrepreneur who never went to college and taught my kids to avoid debt. They both decided to go to college anyway.",
    "description": "I told my kids that they can be successful without a college degree, but they decided to attend college anyway. I'm still so proud of them.",
    "fullText": "I was surprised when my daughter told me she wanted not only to attend college but also to pursue medical school. She even planned out her prerequisite classes, residency, and potential debt.\n\nIn our house, we rarely talked about college because I never went. My husband also only did a few semesters at community college.\n\nHigher education was never a requirement in our house. I never expected my daughters to enroll and take on student loan debt because I found a path to entrepreneurship without all of that.\n\nAnd yet, both of my daughters want to go to college, and I respect their decision.\n\nMy mom has been a salon owner in Baltimore for over 35 years. The salon was my after-school program, my social circle, and my introduction to business. I learned early that work is more than a paycheck. It is the foundation for the kind of life you want to live.\n\nMy mom didn't talk about freedom in a motivational sense. She lived it. She set her own schedule and ran the business in a way that made sense for her. Watching that shaped me more than any degree ever could.\n\nWhen I graduated from high school and had my first child at 18, I didn't even consider college — not because I felt incapable. I simply didn't believe a traditional route was required to build the life that I envisioned for myself.\n\nMy mom taught me how to work hard, how to serve people well, and how to think independently. I built my early adulthood on those values and eventually became an entrepreneur myself, returning to my mother's salon as a co-owner. Everything I learned about resilience, money, and adaptability came from living real life, not writing dissertations about it in a lecture hall.\n\nThe lessons my daughters absorbed from me were not about degrees. The lessons were more about self-discipline and financial awareness. I taught them how to budget. I taught them how to track their spending. I taught them why credit matters and how debt can limit your life before adulthood even begins.\n\nWhen my oldest turned 16 and got her first job, she learned to manage money the same way I did. She made mistakes, then corrected them. She saved. She budgeted. She paid attention. Now she supports herself as a server while attending college using financial aid and cash she earns. She files her own taxes. She pays her own bills. She manages tuition payment plans with intention instead of fear.\n\nWatching her handle her life this way reminds me that independence is a muscle; if you teach your kids how to use it, they grow strong without you having to push.\n\nMy youngest, now a high school senior, is also preparing for college. She has a different personality but the same drive. She does her research. She looks up scholarships. She treats her future like something she is shaping, rather than something that is happening to her. I see two young women who understand the financial reality of higher education but aren't intimidated by it.\n\nThere is immense pride in the fact that my daughters are finding their own way in life, but there is also a quiet ache. You spend years pouring into your children. Then, suddenly, you are watching them become adults who no longer want to live the life you envisioned for them.\n\nAvoiding college debt gave me a certain kind of freedom. Teaching my daughters about money and independence gave them the freedom to make choices. Seeing them use those choices to stretch beyond my experiences feels like the true return on everything I poured into them.\n\nThe goal was never to avoid college. It was about creating a foundation strong enough for them to choose their own direction. Watching them do that is the greatest return on investment I could ever receive.",

    "fullText": "This is only the second season of the 12-team College Football Playoff, but this bracket is among the weirder in the playoff era. Two Group of Five teams? One Group of Five team seemed unfathomable just a few years ago. Now, two are in the playoffs.\n\nThe top four teams are seemingly on another tier in this year’s postseason, but there are some intriguing teams seeded 5-12. Let’s take a look at each team in the playoffs and one player to watch on each team.\n\nWide Receiver, Elijah Sarratt: Stats: 51 receptions, 687 yards, 12 touchdowns\n\nSarratt is a scary good, athletic receiver. He caught what proved to be the game-winning touchdown in the Big Ten Championship in the third quarter. Opposing secondaries are going to have to have a good game plan to prevent him from taking over the game.\n\nDefensive End, Caden Curry: Stats: 11 sacks, 16.5 tackles for loss, 6 quarterback hurries, 1 blocked kick\n\nCurry played with his hair on fire in the Big Ten Championship. That’s nothing new, though. He’s been playing that way all season. With his pass-rushing prowess, Curry can wreck any opposing offensive game plan.\n\nQuarterback, Gunner Stockton: Stats: 70.7 completion percentage, 2,691 yards, 23 touchdowns, 5 interceptions\n\nStockton has settled in nicely after a subpar performance in relief of Carson Beck in the SEC Championship and Playoff Quarterfinals matchup. Opposing defenses can’t take him lightly.\n\nLinebacker, Jacob Rodriguez: Stats: 117 tackles, 11 tackles for loss, 4 interceptions, 7 forced fumbles, 2 fumbles recovered\n\nThere may be no defensive player in college football more impactful than Jacob Rodriguez. The stats speak for themselves. Should Ohio State play the Red Raiders in the National Championship, it will be fascinating to see how the Buckeyes’ offense game plans for Rodriguez.\n\nQuarterback, Dante Moore: Stats: 72.5 completion percentage, 2,733 yards, 24 touchdowns, 6 interceptions\n\nMoore is having a really good season. It will be interesting to see how he will perform on the Playoff stage.\n\nQuarterback, Trinidad Chambliss: Stats: 65.5 completion percentage, 3,016 yards, 18 touchdowns, 3 interceptions; 118 rushes, 470 rushing yards, 6 rushing touchdowns\n\nChambliss started the season as Ole Miss’s backup, but he has taken off as the starter this season and has flourished. It will be interesting to see if he will be distracted by the drama surrounding Lane Kiffin’s departure going into the Playoff.\n\nQuarterback, Marcell Reed: Stats: 61.8 completion percentage, 2,932 yards, 25 touchdowns, 10 interceptions; 89 rushes, 466 rushing yards, 6 rushing touchdowns\n\nIf the Aggies play the Buckeyes in the Quarterfinals at the Cotton Bowl Classic, it will be fascinating to see how the Buckeyes’ defense does against Reed’s dual-threat abilities.\n\nDefensive Lineman, Taylor Wein: Stats: 6 sacks, 14 tackles for loss, 6 quarterback hurries\n\nThe Sooners’ defense is what drives this team. Wein is the engine of it up front. How far the Sooners go will be contingent on his play.\n\nQuarterback, Ty Simpson: Stats: 64.3 completion percentage, 3,268 yards, 26 touchdowns, 5 interceptions\n\nSimpson is a really good quarterback, but he’s coming into the playoffs on a bit of a cold streak. He struggled in the Iron Bowl and the SEC Championship, but Simpson is still a dangerous quarterback who must be taken seriously.\n\nWide Receiver, Malachi Toney: Stats: 84 receptions, 970 yards, 7 touchdowns\n\nToney is a physical beast at wide receiver. He has 25 receptions for 272 yards and two touchdowns in the Hurricanes’ last two games. Should the Buckeyes play the Hurricanes in the Quarterfinals, their secondary could be tested by Toney’s athletic and prolific pass-catching.\n\nOutside Linebacker, Harvey Dyson: Stats: 7 sacks, 10.5 tackles for loss\n\nIf the Green Wave is going to beat Ole Miss, it’s going to start at the line of scrimmage. Dyson is the leader of the Green Wave’s defense.\n\nRunning Back, Wayne Knight: Stats: 190 rushes, 1,263 yards, 9 touchdowns; 37 receptions, 379 receiving yards\n\nKnight is having a really good season in what’s been a dream season for the Dukes. Running games travel, and James Madison will need Knight to have a big day to have a chance at pulling a major upset in Eugene against the Ducks.",

    "fullText": "The first time Fernando Mendoza put his hands on a Heisman Trophy, he did it as a whim on a recruiting trip to Yale.\n\nOn Saturday, he’ll be on stage for the real deal.\n\nMendoza enters having won the Associated Press Player of the Year Award and as the the favorite to win college football’s most prestigious individual award. He would be the first winner from Indiana University and the third with Hispanic roots — titles not lost on the once lightly recruited Miami native who started contemplating this storybook ending a few months ago.\n\n“At the beginning of the year, I saw the list of the top-10 Heisman contenders and evidently (my name) wasn’t there,” he said. “I was like, ‘Wow, I want to make a goal for myself.’ I prayed about, like, if I could make it to the ceremony, how cool that would be. Now that it’s come to fruition, I’m able to share that moment with people who appreciate it. It’s such a cool moment.”\n\nFor Mendoza, his first and likely only season in Bloomington has been filled with memories.\n\nAs fans watched him throw winning touchdown passes late in games against Iowa, Oregon and Penn State what he did behind the scenes — forcing bonds with new teammates, embracing family time and savoring all those special celebrations — helped deliver program-changing victories like a 13-10 victory over No. 1 Ohio State that gave Indiana its first Big Ten title since 1967, a 13-0 mark and the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff.\n\nAlong the way, Mendoza cherished his time studying film with his younger brother, Alberto, meeting with coaches and hearing students serenade him with chants of “HeisMendoza.”\n\nThe funny thing is Fernando Mendoza never sought the spotlight. He just wanted to win.\n\n“He’s just the ultimate professional and a wonderful teammate,” starting center Pat Coogan said. “He prepares like no one I’ve ever seen. He works his butt off like no one I’ve ever seen. He’s just an awesome locker room guy on top of that.”\n\nWhen Mendoza entered the transfer portal last winter, he could have gone essentially anywhere. He chose Indiana because he knew coach Curt Cignetti would push him hard to improve.\n\nMendoza knew of Cignetti’s reputation for developing quarterbacks.\n\nAt North Carolina State, Cignetti worked with Pro Football Hall of Fame semifinalist Philip Rivers and helped recruit Super Bowl champ Russell Wilson. Then as Cignetti guided the most successful transition from the Football Championship Subdivision to the Football Bowl Subdivision he helped three quarterbacks win conference player of the year awards in five seasons.\n\nLast year, his first at Indiana, Cignetti brought in 2023 Mid-American Conference Player of the Year Kurtis Rourke, who led the Hoosiers to a school record 11 victories and their first playoff bid while earning second-team all-Big Ten honors. Rourke finished ninth in the Heisman voting.\n\nWhen Cignetti did his homework on Mendoza, he saw something different from the late-bloomer.\n\n“Being the film junkie I am, and making all the different cutups, occasionally I’d see plays from Fernando at Cal,” Cignetti said. “When he went in the portal, obviously we watched a lot of game tape on him and just really liked his stuff — the quick release, the arm, the mobility. He’s a great person. He really prepares. He’s really smart, and he’s developed quite a bit since he’s been here.”\n\nMendoza’s mobility might not have been as evident in 2024 when he was sacked 41 times.\n\nBut Cignetti embraced taking a two-year starter from a Power Four school with a rich tradition of producing quarterbacks. He was impressed by Mendoza’s crafty work ethic, selfless leadership style and his inspirational journey from grandson of Cuban immigrants to one of America’s best college quarterbacks all while watching his mother battle multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe adversity has helped Mendoza maintain a positive approach with the kind of real-life perspective rarely found in a 22-year-old with the spotlight shining so brightly on him.\n\n“I’ve been lucky enough to have such a great team that I’ve always been in a good position to win games,” Mendoza said. “That’s what’s helped elevate me to the position I’ll be in Saturday night.”\n\nIt didn’t take Mendoza long to win the hearts of Hoosiers fans, who have waited decades to cheer a legitimate Heisman contender.\n\nThe last time was 2001 when quarterback Antwaan Randle El finished sixth in the voting. The best finish by an Indiana player was 1989 when running back Anthony Thompson finished second.\n\nBut Mendoza didn’t impress immediately. His breakout game came in Week 4, a rout over then-No. 8 Illinois when he threw five TD passes for the second straight week. Suddenly, to his surprise, friends began touting him as a Heisman contender.\n\nOne week later, at Iowa, he beat a blitz to find Elijah Sarratt for a 49-yard touchdown with 88 seconds to go. But the play that showed his teammates what Mendoza was all about came when he took a big hit on a run out of bounds that ignited a sideline shoving match.\n\n“I told him we had his back. I said ‘Go out there and just sling it, we have all the confidence in the world in you,’” linebacker Aiden Fisher said. “That dude’s got some confidence, too. He’s got some swagger. He looked at me and said, ‘I got us. don’t even worry about it.’”\n\nHe showed his resilience again at No. 3 Oregon with a tiebreaking 8-yard TD pass to Sarratt after throwing the Pick-6 that tied the score at 20. He did it again in the final minute at Penn State and again in the third quarter against the Buckeyes, putting him here on the cusp of hoisting his own Heisman Trophy.\n\n“The (other finalists) are fantastic players. I think everybody, when you’re a finalist, you’ve got to prepare a speech because anything could happen,” Mendoza said before discussing the Heisman being a goal. “I thought of it, but it was a little bit more of a dream and a long-range goal or a goal you reach a little farther than you think you could reach.”\n\nIt could be right in his hands Saturday night.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee executed Harold Wayne Nichols by lethal injection Thursday in Nashville for the 1988 rape and murder of Karen Pulley, a 20-year-old student at Chattanooga State Community College.\n\nNichols, 64, had confessed to killing Pulley as well as raping several other women in the Chattanooga area. Although he expressed remorse at trial, he admitted he would have continued his violent behavior had he not been arrested. He was sentenced to death in 1990.\n\n“To the people I've harmed, I'm sorry,” Nichols said in his final statement. Before Nichols died, a spiritual adviser prayed over him in the execution chamber and the two recited together the 23rd Psalm and the Lord's Prayer. At several points, they teared up and their voices became strained. After the final “Amen,” the adviser, J.R. Davis, continued talking quietly, with Nichols nodding along.\n\n“Go in peace, my friend. I love you,” Davis told Nichols.\n\nNichols was strapped to a gurney with a sheet pulled up to just above his waist and a long tube running from an adjoining room to an IV inserted on the inside of his elbow. There was a spot of blood near the injection site. At one point he took a very heavy breath and his whole torso rose up. He then took a series of short, huffing breaths that witnesses said sounded like snorting or snoring. Nichols’ face turned red and he groaned. His breathing then appeared to slow, then stop, and his face became purple before he was pronounced dead.\n\nNichols' sister, Deborah Perry, watched the execution from a witness chamber and cried quietly but did not speak.\n\nNichols’ attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have his sentence commuted to life in prison, citing the fact that he took responsibility for his crimes and pleaded guilty. His clemency petition stated “he would be the first person to be executed for a crime he pleaded guilty to since Tennessee re-enacted the death penalty in 1978.”\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to issue a stay of the execution on Thursday.\n\nPulley's sister, Lisette Monroe, had wanted to be present for the execution but became too overwhelmed, her husband and Pulley's brother-in-law, Jeff Monroe, told media afterwards. He read a statement that said the family “was destroyed by evil” the night Pulley was killed.\n\n“Taking a life is serious, and we take no pleasure in it,” he said. “However, the victims, and there were many, were carefully stalked and attacked. The crimes, and there were many, were deliberate, violent, and horrific.”\n\nIn a recent interview, Lisette Monroe, said the wait for Nichols' execution has been “37 years of hell.” She described her sister as “gentle, sweet and innocent,” and said she hopes that after the execution she'll be able to focus on the happy memories of Pulley instead of her murder.\n\nPulley, who was 20 when she was killed, had just finished Bible college and was attending school in Chattanooga to become a paralegal, Jeff Monroe said.\n\n“Karen was bubbly, happy, selfless, and looking forward to the life before her,” he said.\n\nNichols' attorney, Debbie Drew, also spoke after the execution, saying her client had turned his life over to God after speaking to Pulley's mother decades ago, shortly after he was sentenced. His execution “sent the message that no one can rise beyond the crimes they committed decades earlier and that redemption deserves no mercy,” she said.\n\nDavis said after the execution that he had known Nichols for a decade as part of a prison men's group and believes that Nichols' remorse and spiritual transformation were genuine. Davis said Nichols committed “horrible crimes. But killing to teach people not to kill just doesn't make sense.”\n\nNichols had seen two previous execution dates come and go. The state earlier planned to execute him in August 2020, but Nichols was given a reprieve due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMany states have had difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs as anti-death penalty activists have put pressure on drug companies and other suppliers. Between the shortages and legal challenges over botched executions, some states have moved to alternative methods of execution including a firing squad in South Carolina and nitrogen gas in Alabama.\n\nIncluding Nichols, a total of 46 men have died by court-ordered execution this year in the U.S.\n\nCorrects that Pulley was a student at Chattanooga State Community College.\n\nReporter Adrian Sainz contributed from Memphis, Tennessee.",

    "fullText": "The NCAA Transfer Portal doesn’t officially open for another three weeks, but that hasn’t stopped hundreds of players from announcing their intentions to enter.\n\nOfficially, players can be entered into the portal beginning January 2, and will have a two-week window until January 15 to get in. For players who are playing in the College Football Playoff beyond those dates, they’ll have a five-day window after their team’s final game to get in as well.\n\nMore than 300 players have already expressed their plans to enter the portal, and On3’s rankings team has graded the entrants as of Dec. 11. Last year, more than 4,900 FBS players — including walk-ons — entered their name in the portal between the two windows.\n\nNow with only one window, we could see that number dwindle some, or it could be a mad dash to get into college football’s version of free agency. Here are the top 10 players currently expected to enter next month:\n\nLeavitt entered the 2025 season as a darkhorse Heisman candidate after a breakout campaign as a redshirt freshman, where he completed nearly 62 percent of his passes for 2,885 yards and 24 touchdowns to just six interceptions. He was riddled by injuries though, missing the team’s final five regular-season games. Last month, On3’s Steve Wiltfong and Pete Nakos reported Leavitt was being shopped around to other programs by his representatives, and he didn’t attend the team’s end-of-season banquet over the weekend.\n\nIn spite of very up-and-down quarterback play during his two seasons with the Spartans, Marsh established himself as one of the Big Ten’s premier receivers. In his debut campaign, Marsh tallied 41 catches for 649 yards and three touchdowns. His receiving yards and receptions stand as the most by a true freshman in school history. This year, he hauled in 59 catches, totaling 662 yards and six touchdowns. With two years of eligibility left, he’ll be one of the most sought-after players in the portal.\n\nCarter’s winding career in Knoxville looks to officially be over after two seasons. An early commit during his senior year to the Vols, Carter flirted with other programs ahead of Signing Day in 2023, but did officially ink with Tennessee. He quickly made his presence felt as a freshman, totaling 38 tackles, three tackles for loss and an interception. But issues began to pop up last offseason, and he was nearly dismissed from the team prior to fall camp. He appeared in nine games as a sophomore in a significantly reduced role, and will be looking for a fresh start elsewhere.\n\nA late addition to Notre Dame’s 2023 class, Minchey sat behind Sam Hartman and Riley Leonard his first two seasons with the program. This spring and into the fall, he battled with redshirt freshman CJ Carr for the starting job, with Carr ultimately getting the nod. During his three years in South Bend, Minchey completed 23 of 29 passes for 212 yards and will be one of the more intriguing quarterback options in the portal come January.\n\nDespite coming from the MAC, Trick is the highest-rated pass-rusher currently in the portal. Across his last two seasons, he has appeared in 27 games for the RedHawks, totaling 96 tackles, 18 tackles for loss and 13 sacks. The 6-foot-4, 245-pounder has also been a turnover machine with three forced fumbles and was named first-team All-MAC this year.\n\nA native of Huntington Beach (Calif.), Brown burst onto the scene this fall after missing most of his career due to injury. Fully healthy this season, he caught 71 passes for 1,085 yards and 11 touchdowns while averaging better than 108 yards per contest. The 6-foot, 185-pounder is another who will be highly coveted as a plug-and-play wideout.\n\nDavis joined the Tigers late in the 2025 cycle, flipping from SEC rival Kentucky to Missouri just days before National Signing Day. Rivals ranked him as the country’s No. 7 running back in the class, and he showed why in small spurts as a true freshman. While playing behind All-American Ahmad Hardy and standout Jamal Roberts, he rushed 34 times for 200 yards and a pair of touchdowns. The Cleveland product will have all four years of eligibility remaining after only playing in three games.\n\nDel Grande, a native of Pennsylvania, developed into a three-year starter at left tackle and earned a preseason All-Sun Belt selection in 2025. As a sophomore, in 2024, he helped anchor a unit that led the Sun Belt in fewest sacks allowed (15), a mark which ranked tied for 17th in the NCAA FBS.\n\nDickens started his career at Georgia Tech, but transferred to play for the Flames ahead of last season. In his lone year in Lynchburg, he rushed for 1,339 yards and 16 touchdowns on just 229 carries, averaging 5.8 yards per attempt. His 17 total scores ranked No. 4 nationally, while his rushing average (121.9 YPG) was third-best in the country. The second-team All-CUSA has two years of eligibility left.\n\nA three-year starter at left tackle for the Huskies, Malcore led a unit that paved the way for one of the best rushing offenses in the country in 2024 and 2025. In total, he started 32 games during his time at NIU and projects as a plug-and-play tackle for teams seeking experience along the offensive line this fall.\n\n+ Perry Thompson (No. 13) – The Auburn wide receiver showed up on The Plains with high hopes, but struggled to carve out a significant role behind Eric Singleton, Cam Coleman and Malcolm Simmons. Thompson hauled in 17 passes for 154 yards this season and will have two years of eligibility remaining.\n\n+ CJ Baxter Jr. (No. 14) – A former five-star, Baxter never quite rebounded from the ACL injury he suffered at the beginning of his sophomore season 2024. As a true freshman the year prior, he accounted for 815 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns, but this year he carried just 54 times for 196 yards. The Florida native will be one to watch for a number of Sunshine State programs.\n\n+ Dylan Edwards (No. 15) – Edwards’ journey continues after playing at both Kansas State and Colorado during his first three seasons. An all-purpose weapon, he accounted for nearly 700 yards and seven touchdowns as a sopho\n\n+ Jerrick Gibson (No. 20) – Another highly touted back coming from the Longhorns, Gibson spent two seasons in Austin where he struggled to break through on the depth chart. He played in all 15 games as a freshman after Baxter’s injury, totaling 402 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns. But he only played in four games as a sophomore, rushing for 152 yards before leaving the program in October to preserve his redshirt.\n\n+ Derek Williams (No. 27) – The third notable Texas entrant on the list, Williams appeared in 29 games across his three years on the Forty Acres, registering 76 tackles, two tackles for loss and an interception. He had a breakout season as a true freshman in 2023 with 42 tackles, but suffered a season-ending injury the following year and only appeared in four games in 2024.\n\nHe returned in 2025, but primarily served as a backup to senior Michael Taaffe, a second-team All-American last season.",

    "description": "Trivago CEO Johannes Thomas shares how he rose from intern to chief executive without finishing college, driven by curiosity and learning.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Johannes Thomas, CEO of Trivago. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2011, I took a six-month internship at Trivago. I was in my third year of university, nearing completion of a four-year degree in economics and tourism. I had started a digital travel company on the side, and I planned to learn from the internship and apply the new skills to my own company.\n\nThe internship came with a steep learning curve. Back then, the company had about 50 employees, many of whom were interns. I had a lot of responsibility and room to grow. Being at Trivago felt like playing in a crazy sandbox where I could try anything.\n\nI never had the expectation of following a traditional career path. My father was an entrepreneur who ran a tour company in Germany. I considered joining the family business, but I was interested in the digital side of tourism. Coming from an entrepreneurial family, I was taught to follow my curiosity.\n\nStill, my mother wasn't thrilled when I dropped out of school. She argued that I only had one more year, and I should just finish. I have no regrets about not getting my degree, however. I rarely think about it these days.\n\nMy internship at Trivago was focused on online marketing in the UK. At the time, Google's performance marketing was the new frontier. You couldn't learn about it at school, because once a book was published, its information was outdated.\n\nYou had to learn by trying things out, which gave young people like me a real advantage. Since I was able to understand performance marketing, I was hired to handle global search engine marketing. I stayed in that role for three years before moving on to strategic projects.\n\nI've changed jobs at Trivago every two to three years. I try to make myself obsolete within a team, and always move on to something that's a new learning experience. Since my internship, I've held six different positions.\n\nThe pandemic, which hit when I was chief revenue officer, was a near-death experience for Trivago. We lost 95% of our revenue within a matter of weeks. No one knew when it would come back.\n\nThat's when I stepped away from the company for the first time. I formed a startup with other Trivago folks. I'm still involved with that as an investor, but in 2023 I returned to Trivago as CEO.\n\nWhen I came back, the team was very demoralized. As the leader, I needed to take decisive actions to stabilize the company and create success. Luckily, travel came back stronger than ever. Today, Trivago has about 600 employees (down from about 1,500 before the pandemic), but we're able to make a great impact due to technology like AI.\n\nThree of the four leaders of Trivago started as interns, so my experience is not unique. We aim to be a company where people can grow long-term.\n\nTrivago still has a strong internship program: in fact, I've about doubled the number of interns since 2023. It's great for recruiting. When someone has a six-month internship, you really get to see whether they're going to contribute to your team.\n\nWhen I hire, I always ask people about their portfolio before I ask about their degree. A degree is important for getting into the workforce, but it becomes less important when you're able to demonstrate the real impact you've had. I've been successful because I take initiative and execute ideas. That's more important than any degree.",

I love analyzing themes, motives, and emotional arcs, and I assumed the Bravo franchise had nothing to offer but mindless drama.\n\nFor years, I had avoided the shows and would usually leave the room when my teenage daughter turned them on. Today, things have changed. I now happily watch the drama, appreciative of how my daughter and I have connected and found a way to talk about important topics through what many consider to be a guilty-pleasure show.\n\nMy daughter went off to college, and got busier, more independent, and harder to read from a distance. I missed her like crazy and often felt like I had fewer and fewer windows into the woman she was becoming.\n\nSo when she suggested I watch an episode of \"The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,\" a show I'd long viewed as the epitome of trash TV, I surprised us both by reconsidering.\n\nEven though we were two states away from each other, while my daughter is away at school, I decided to watch an episode on my own. I didn't expect to like it, but I love my daughter more than I dislike reality TV, so I gave it a try.\n\nWhen I sat down for my first episode, I expected tacky glam, tired stereotypes, and fake conflict, and I got all of that. But I also saw a lot more, including women wrestling with shame and accountability, resisting unrealistic expectations, confronting faith transitions, and reinventing themselves after major midlife upheavals.\n\nTo my surprise, I was hooked, especially when I started talking through the storylines with my daughter.\n\nI was shocked at how fast the show became our shared language. We started out laughing at the bad behavior and wild fashion, but soon the conversations deepened, and we found ourselves discussing body image, mental health, and relationships, especially women's friendships. In fact, we've talked \n\nWatching \"RHOSLC\" has opened a new connection between my daughter and me at a stage of parenting when I wasn't sure how to reach her. Through our weekly Housewives debriefs, I've learned so much about her views on loyalty, identity, ambition, faith, and belonging.\n\nShe notices patterns in relationships that took me decades to understand. Her emotional intelligence, especially her ability to call out toxicity and name her boundaries, reassures me that she's not just okay, she's thriving.\n\nAnd in turn, I've been able to share my own insights, not in my lecturing \"mom voice,\" but as another woman navigating friendships, reinvention, and societal pressures. Watching the show has created a neutral space where we can meet as equals, rather than parent and child.\n\nI'm still not a fan of how the show perpetuates negative stereotypes, promotes conspicuous consumption, and glamorizes toxic relationships for entertainment value. But I appreciate how the show gives us a way to talk openly about those issues. Watching women in midlife grapple with everything from body image to an empty nest provides young women with a wider, more complex picture of adulthood than they might find elsewhere.\n\nThis experience has changed how I think about connecting with my adult children. Sometimes the best bridge isn't a carefully crafted heart-to-heart, it's the willingness to try new things and meet them where they are. And I'm reminded that I would do anything for my kids. Even watch reality TV.",

    "description": "Former Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray predicts how the College Football Playoff will go and the national champion.",
    "fullText": "Former Georgia Bulldog and college football analyst Aaron Murray released his prediction on the College Football Playoff. He went on his social media account to release the prediction, and he went with his former team, picking the Georgia Bulldogs to win the national championship.\n\nHe pointed out all the winners of each playoff game, so Georgia would defeat the No. 6 Ole Miss Rebels, the No. 10 Miami Hurricanes, and the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers to win the national championship. Another wrinkle in his Georgia pride is he predicts former Georgia quarterback Carson Beck to go far in the playoff, with his Miami Hurricanes beating No. 7 Texas A&M and No. 2 Ohio State on their way to the semifinals. Beck would face his former team in that game if Murray's prediction comes true.\n\nMurray might be showing some bias to his former team, but the Bulldogs should be considered a championship-caliber team. ESPN's Football Power Index structure has the Bulldogs in the second-tier of championship contending teams, behind Indiana and Ohio State.\n\nHowever, Georgia has one of the strongest resumes in the playoff, placing second behind just Indiana in strength of record, a stat that quantifies how good a team is based on if an average Top 25 team would have that team's record or better, given that team's schedule.\n\nBias aside, Aaron Murray's prediction illustrates how easy of a path Georgia has to the national championship. In the Sugar Bowl, the Bulldogs get to play either Ole Miss, a team that they've already beaten, or Tulane, a Group of Five opponent. In the semifinal, they play either Ohio State, who has an 0-2 record vs. Georgia, Texas A&M, who beat just one opponent currently in the top 25 (Notre Dame), or Miami, who has their former quarterback.\n\nGonna be one heck of a playoff but only 1 team can win it all\n\nAnd that team will be THE GEORGIA BULLDAWGS pic.twitter.com/F5YvKyHxxr\n\n— Aaron Murray (@aaronmurray11) December 9, 2025\n\nFollow UGA Wire on Instagram or Threads for more Georgia football coverage!\n\nThis article originally appeared on UGA Wire: Aaron Murray predicts CFP, winner of national championship",

    "fullText": "Don't count on a college degree to land your dream job in Silicon Valley.\n\nIncreasingly, founders and tech companies are judging talent by how quickly someone can learn, adapt, and build — not on how long they spent in a lecture hall — reshaping traditional pathways into the workforce.\n\nFei-Fei Li, the Stanford computer science professor widely known as the \"Godmother of AI,\" is one example of this.\n\nIn an interview on \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" this week, she spoke about the value of a degree when it comes to hiring for her AI startup, World Labs.\n\n\"When we interview a software engineer, I personally feel the degree they have matters less to us now,\" Li said.\n\n\"Now, it's more about what have you learned, what tools do you use, how quickly can you superpower yourself in using these tools — and a lot of these are AI tools,\" she said. \"What's your mindset toward using these tools matter more to me.\"\n\nHer hiring bar has become even clearer: she won't hire software engineers who resist AI.\n\n\"At this point in 2025 — hiring at World Labs — I would not hire any software engineer who does not embrace AI collaborative software tools,\" Li said.\n\nIt's not about automating humans out of the equation, she added — it's about identifying people who can grow as fast as the technology around them.\n\n\"If you're able to use these tools, you're able to learn. You can superpower yourself better,\" she said.\n\nLi's stance is part of a broader shift playing out across Silicon Valley, where more founders and even major tech firms are openly questioning the value of higher education.\n\nPalantir's CEO, Alex Karp, has openly challenged the value of a college education, urging young entrepreneurs to skip the lecture hall and learn by doing instead — a view echoed by LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, who has said that adaptability and AI fluency now matter far more than the \"fanciest degrees.\"\n\n\"AI makes skill sets based on years of education irrelevant,\" Dan Rhoton, CEO of Hopeworks, told Business Insider. Hopeworks is a tech-training nonprofit that prepares underrepresented talent for AI-enabled jobs.\n\nAfter 13 years of preparing unemployed young adults ages 17 to 26 in Camden, New Jersey, and Philadelphia for tech careers, Rhoton said he has watched firsthand how AI is upending the value of a college degree.\n\n\"We're seeing more and more employers coming to us, saying, 'We used to require a bachelor's degree in this, but we don't understand why.'\"\n\nInstead, he said, employers now want a \"value proposition,\" which he said any job seeker can achieve by showing an AI-generated solution to a company's specific problems.\n\n\"This is the age of: I'm someone who's going to deliver business value,\" Rhoton said. \"Not: I have the right degree.\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNew Penn State football coach Matt Campbell has already started to hit the ground running on establishing a new identity in State College after building and maintaining a foundation of consistency in Ames across the last decade.\n\nIn doing so, he knows a thing or two about team culture, chemistry and what a winning tradition looks like. He sat down with Josh Pate on the \"Pate Speaker Series\" to unveil his vision.\n\n“We’re going to have to prove it,\" Campbell said. \"Words are great, but we’re going to have to prove it.\"\n\nPenn State underachieved massively this past season, as it limped its way to a bowl game at 6-6 after beginning the year as the preseason No. 2 team in the nation before James Franklin was fired midseason after a berth in the College Football Playoff was no longer sustainable.\n\nCampbell intends to ensure a repeat doesn't happen next fall.\n\n“Toughness still wins in this sport. … Mentally and physically tough. We know how to build mental and physical toughness in a football team,\" Campbell said.\n\nToughness remains a key pillar, which is something Campbell wants to have his players master on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\"Our discipline has got us to play and beat the best of the best,” Campbell said. \"Those values still reside in any championship football team and football program. That’s what’s going to have to reside at Penn State.\"\n\nCampbell certainly has his work cut out for him, but if anything, if there's someone who has done a similar turnaround before, it's him. It just happens to be alongside the biggest job he's ever had in his coaching career.\n\nFor now, though it remains to be seen whether he's still ends up being the right man for the job.

    "title": "Developmental Programs in College Football: Claims vs Execution",
    "description": "Why having a developmental program isn't bad.",
    "fullText": "Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano has made many claims that the Scarlet Knights are a “developmental program”, and for good reason. Over the years, Schiano and his company have taken lower-graded talent, even walk-ons, and turned them into capable starters at the college level. A few recent notable examples of this are offensive tackle Hollin Pierce (walk-on), wide receiver Christian Dremel (walk-on), cornerback Christian Braswell (two-star), safety Christian Izien (three-star), and running back Kyle Monangai (a low three-star). Out of those five players, four have landed on NFL teams, largely due to their exceptional development in college.\n\nThat development has continued into 2025 and has paid dividends on offense last season. Players like KJ Duff, Antwan Raymond, Athan Kaliakmanis, and many of the offensive linemen looked better this season than last. In other words, their college development continued at a very solid pace through the offseason. However, that trend did not continue on the defensive side of the ball. In fact, many players regressed in some areas.\n\nFor example, many of the transfers Rutgers brought in were completely ineffective. There were questions on whether grabbing players from lower levels would help the Knights, since it is a large jump from the group of five to the Big Ten, but to be reduced to what they were just doesn’t make sense. Not only were players like Bradley Weaver, Jett Elad, Eric O’Neill, and Jacobie Henderson solid starters at the lower level, they were stars. Stars who should have been able to adjust to the Big Ten if given the proper guidance. If a few of the defensive portal additions didn’t adjust properly, that would be a different story. However, since none of them did, other than Elad and O’Neill to a very late and very limited degree, it becomes clear that they were not developed properly to compete at this level once they got here.\n\nThe examples continue with returning players as well. Linebacker Dariel Djabome was a star for Rutgers last season. Safety Kaj Sanders showed a lot of promise in his freshman season. Both of them took a step back this season under new position coaches. Players don’t just forget how to play football. Stars don’t just forget how to be stars. The development from last year to this year did not continue, and as a result, players regressed.\n\nMany of the Rutgers faithful are disgruntled with the term “developmental program.” However, how much of that hostility has stemmed from the reality that this so-called developmental program did not develop much last season on defense? If the transfers were developed to be Big Ten-ready, and if the talent from last season on defense continued its progression, the term developmental program would seem more fitting. Perhaps it is not the notion of being a developmental program that’s the issue, but rather the execution of those claims.\n\nRutgers under Greg Schiano will always have the mindset of being a developmental program, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, especially for a program like Rutgers that can’t just recruit several five stars year in and year out. On offense this season, they showed that they can do just that. However, it is the several poor and inexperienced defensive coaching hires that the Knights have made that have made them deviate from actually developing the players on that side of the ball. If Rutgers football can make the appropriate coaching hires on defense this offseason, it should be able to get back on track towards becoming a better overall team.",

    "description": "With the College Football Playoffs fast approaching, we ranked the top head coaches in the field.",
    "fullText": "In football, the head coach's decisions have the ability to swing games, whether it's a head-scratching play-call or a botched end-of-game situation. Those decisions are magnified in a postseason setting, which is exactly the stakes of the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe best coaches are able to manage the game to their advantage, giving their players the best possible chance to go out and succeed. But others unintentionally find ways to undercut their players and team, resulting in a loss that could've been a win simply with better coaching.\n\nThe 2025 edition of the CFP features a number of high-level coaches.\n\nEven the head coaches of the Group of Five teams in the field, James Madison's Bob Chesney and Tulane's Jon Sumrall, will not be back at their respective programs after accepting Power 4 head coaching positions. Some have championship pedigree; others are just kicking open the door of their careers. One coach, due to the nature of college football in 2025, has never been a head coach but will be thrust into the spotlight come the first round.\n\nIn this piece, we'll be ranking each head coach participating in the CFP from 12 to 1, taking into account all the duties that it takes to be a head football coach in the playoff.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-1, 7-1 SEC\n\nAs a result of Lane Kiffin's pre-CFP departure to LSU, Pete Golding was named the head coach of the Rebels both in the playoff and moving forward. Though he's fielded solid units during his three seasons as the defensive coordinator, it wouldn't be responsible to rank him anywhere else but 12th on this list, as he's never been the head coach for a game at the college level.\n\n2025 Team Record: 10-2, 6-2 ACC\n\nMario Cristobal as a recruiter and Mario Cristobal as a football coach are two different things and thus would place him at different spot on this list. But as a football coach, the former Ducks head man has made numerous questionable on-field decisions during his time with Miami. Let's not forget, two ACC losses had the Hurricanes relying on a win all the way back in August against a Notre Dame quarterback in CJ Carr making his first career start just to eke their way into the final at-large spot.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-2, 8-1 AAC\n\nHaving accepted the head coaching job at Florida, this will be Jon Sumrall's final ride with the Green Wave. He's shown himself as someone who can turn programs around, as he took over a five-win Troy program in 2022 and immediately won 23 combined games in two seasons before taking the Tulane job. The Green Wave won 11 games before he got there and he's more than kept them afloat, elevating them to a playoff appearance. Despite making the CFP, Sumrall's team isn't particularly great at anything and is just 50th in scoring defense, his speciality. For those reasons, Sumrall, still a very good coach and worthy of the Gators' job, lands at No. 10.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 9-0 Sun Belt Conference\n\nTaking over the James Madison program ahead of 2024 season after leading Holy Cross to five consecutive Patriot League titles, the winning ways have continued for the Dukes under Bob Chesney. Curt Cignetti lifted up the program as they became an FBS team in 2022, and Chesney has done even better. The 48-year-old is still relatively on the younger side as a head coach and has proven himself to be a tremendous leader of men in his 16 years as a head coach — so much so that he was hired by UCLA to try to resurrect the Bruins' program.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-1, 7-1 SEC\n\nIt's hard to argue with Mike Elko's record this season, but due to the disappointments of last season's 8-5 campaign and Las Vegas Bowl meltdown loss to the USC Trojans, it's hard to put him any higher on this list. A 7-5 season in 2023 at Duke managed to get him hired to lead the Aggies program and he's done what's asked of him in leading them to the playoff. But you're unlikely to hear Elko's name uttered amongst the inner circle of college football head coaches anytime soon.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 9-1 Big 12\n\nJoey McGuire's in a similar spot as Elko, as he's unlikely to be mentioned with the top head coaches in the sport. Despite that, he's done a good job with this Red Raiders team, albeit with an influx in NIL compensation and transfer portal talent. Regardless, McGuire is ultimately responsible for the coalition of the team as a whole and they've meshed about as well as anyone could've hoped.\n\n2025 Team Record: 10-3, 7-2 SEC\n\nDeBoar catches a lot of heat whenever Alabama loses, but it's always worth a reminder that he's following the legend of Nick Saban — who is un-followable and the Crimson Tide job was always going to be a tough one once he retired because the expectations are set through the roof. All things considered, DeBoer has handled it relatively well. Where he excels is on the offensive side of the ball, as he led an explosive Washington offense in 2023 to the national title game and has the Tide averaging over 30 points per game in the rugged SEC.\n\n2025 Team Record: 10-2, 6-2 SEC\n\nBrent Venables' coaching tenure at Oklahoma has been mired with two disappointing 6-7 seasons, but his defensive coaching prowess has been on full display in 2025, completely carrying him to a top five spot. Despite battling SEC teams for eight of their games, the Sooners' defense ranks seventh in scoring defense and ninth in scoring defense. Without those efforts on that side of the ball, Venables and Oklahoma wouldn't be anywhere close to the position they're in.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 9-1 Big Ten\n\nThere's a clear top four of head coaches in the CFP and Ryan Day just barely misses out on the top three. Yes, he has an 82-11 record, won a national championship last season and just extinguished his four-game losing streak to the rival Michigan Wolverines. But much of the Buckeyes' successes have been due to the coordinator and position coaches, who have been extremely highly-regarded. Day doesn't project as a \"leader of men\" type of coach nor as an X's and O's guy. He's the conductor of the whole show for Ohio State and deserves credit for the national title, but falls behind the following three coaches.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 8-1 SEC\n\nOne of the best things about Kirby Smart during his time at Georgia has been that the Bulldogs have an identity. They know exactly who they are as a team, as they'll punch you in the mouth and drag you to the deep end. It's a mentality thing and one that Smart has instilled within the culture of his program. He's won two national championships and come close to more, with this season presenting itself as another opportunity. Off-the-field player issues aside, Smart is one of the golden standards of head football coaches in the sport.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-1, 8-1 Big Ten\n\nDan Lanning's defensive prowess showed perhaps this season more than any other during his four-year tenure with the Oregon Ducks, but it was his ability to motivate his players that stuck out the most. Any slight against his program gets used to his advantage, as his motivational tactics are top notch. The only thing missing for Lanning — though to be fair it is just his fourth season — is postseason success, as he hasn't led the Ducks to a playoff win. He'll have a good chance to do so in Oregon's first-round matchup with Chesney's James Madison squad.\n\n2025 Team Record: 13-0, 10-0 Big Ten\n\nI mean, just Google him. All Curt Cignetti does is win, and he's done it at every stop. He elevated James Madison into an 11-win team in his second season and has completely uplifted the entire Indiana program from the bottom of the conference and resigned to being a \"basketball school\" to what it is today: champions of the Big Ten and the No. 1 seed in the CFP. Meanwhile, he had a scowl on his face after the conference title game. Cignetti is never satisfied with success and has him team on the path of winning a national championship.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Ranking the top head coaches in the 2025 CFP field",

    "fullText": "I've been helping my 17-year-old daughter, a senior in high school, apply to college.\n\nI've watched her type her applications, and it sparked a flashback to when I sat in the kitchen of my run-down college apartment and learned I was pregnant with her.\n\nI'll never forget the look of the brown linoleum floor illuminated under the harsh fluorescent light, its buzzing the only other sound competing with my sobs. My boyfriend held his head in his hands, the positive pregnancy tests fanned around him like the color sticks at a nail salon.\n\nIs it really possible that I was only a few years older than my daughter is right now? She, who still prefers me to run in and grab the smoothie I preordered because she doesn't like to talk to people? The girl whose room is messier than I ever thought possible? The one whose kindergarten picture was so perfect it took my breath away?\n\nI can't even fathom what it would look like for her to be facing down motherhood in a few short years, so it's stirred some new emotions up for me.\n\nI distinctly remember my boyfriend picking me up for class at the beginning of that semester. The sun was shining, my gold hoops were swinging, and as I hopped into his truck, I felt a surge of hope and excitement for the future.\n\nThat was a few weeks before I would realize that my period was not coming after all. Looking at my daughter now, it's finally hitting me: I was so young.\n\nThe naive self-confidence of my younger, college self crumbled that night in my apartment kitchen, and I can't say that I ever regained it. Becoming a mother at any stage can have that effect on you. It carves you apart, empties you out, and makes you question everything at all times forever.\n\nNow, as my teenage daughter teeters on the cusp of the age I was when I had her, I feel a little bit of loss and grief for my own self at her stage.\n\nSeeing her with the world at her fingertips reminds me of how I felt just before she came into existence. I had no fears. I was confident in a way I would never be again.\n\nBut what I remember the most, among the uncertainty, the anxiety, and the complete reorganizing of myself, is the moment I met her, the instant the nurse laid her on my chest. The moment my newborn baby nestled herself into me, burrowing, it felt as though she had straight into my heart; I felt a complete recognition, like nothing I could ever describe. My only thought was, Oh. It's you.\n\nI remember a complete calm settling into my being, as if we were two souls who had known each other forever, simply meeting again.\n\nI feel like I've spent the past 18 years learning who I am with her and because of her. Overnight, I'm supposed to relearn what it's like to live without her here. I feel a mixture of fear and excitement for her future, much like I did in those early days of her existence.\n\nI also feel grief for the girl I was when I had her, but I don't want her to share in that grief.\n\nI want her to feel the freedom I had at her age, even if I acknowledge the loss of my own.\n\nI want her to have a life I did not have, while never, for a second, feeling guilt for her life.\n\nI want things that feel impossible, for both of us. But she has the world at her fingertips now, and I want so much for her to embrace every bit of it, maybe, selfishly, for both of us.\n\nAnd no matter what happens, I hope and pray that we can always find our way back together, just like that moment we first met, when I can hold her close again and whisper, Oh, it's you.",

    "fullText": "On Saturday, 22-year-old Fernando Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to their first Big Ten championship since 1967 — but the top quarterback's professional résumé looks nearly as impressive as his football record.\n\nWith their 13-10 win over Ohio State, Indiana secured the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history — and Mendoza's performance solidified his Heisman Trophy frontrunner status.\n\nBorn and raised in Miami, Mendoza was a two-star recruit out of high school and overlooked by most Power 4 programs. He was committed to playing at Yale until Cal lost a prospect and called him up with an offer he couldn't turn down: a free education and better football.\n\nAfter three seasons at Cal, where he worked his way up to starting quarterback and graduated from the prestigious Haas School of Business, he transferred to Indiana last winter. The move meant losing his scholarship with Cal, but earning a lot more money in endorsement deals.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, one of the first things he did with his \"name, image, likeness\" earnings was to cover the cost of the two classes he needed to graduate from Cal after his scholarship was terminated.\n\nMendoza, who's now pursuing his master's at Indiana's Kelley School of Business, spends more time on LinkedIn than he does on Instagram, TikTok, or other social platforms.\n\n\"The only social media that's on my phone right now is LinkedIn and YouTube to watch videos,\" he told The Herald Times. He has an Instagram account with more than 80,000 followers, but enlists his younger brother, Alberto, who also plays quarterback for the Hoosiers, to manage it.\n\nA post shared by HeraldTimesOnline (@heraldtimesonline)\n\nMendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also be a top candidate for a job in finance.\n\nHe's spent his last few summers interning at real estate investment firms ACRE and Newmark. Juggling his internships with hours of football practice required a 5:30 a.m. wake-up call and an intricate whiteboard, where he'd keep a running list of action items.\n\nMendoza is just as disciplined with his money as he is with his schedule.\n\n\"He doesn't spend any money on himself,\" his mom told the WSJ. \"All he does is invest.\"\n\nA post shared by Big Ten Network (@bigtennetwork)\n\nHis brother, with whom he shared a room growing up and now shares a car, pointed out that he also doesn't like to spend money on gas.\n\nAlberto told Big Ten Network: \"I go to use the car, and it's empty. There's no more gas in the car, and I'm like, 'We're just gonna use the car and not fill it back up?' And Fernando is like, 'Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.' … And then I have to go to the gas station on like one mile of gas.\"",

No. 5 UConn will take on No. 18 Florida inside of Madison Square Garden.\n\nDan Hurley's Huskies suffered their first loss of the season against Arizona on Nov. 19, but they quickly recovered with four straight victories.

A victory over a top-five opponent would put the Gators back on the right track, though, as they look to build momentum before diving into their SEC schedule.\n\nThe Sporting News has all the details on how to watch UConn vs. Florida.\n\nUConn vs. Florida will air nationally on ESPN.
