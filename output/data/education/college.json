    "fullText": "Ole Miss vs. Miami predictions: Expert picks and odds for 2025 CFP semifinal at Fiesta Bowl originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNo. 6 Ole Miss will meet No. 10 Miami in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl on Thursday, Jan. 8.\n\nKickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The game will be televised on ESPN.\n\nOle Miss (13-1) stunned No. 3 Georgia 39-34 in the Allstate Sugar Bowl behind an incredible effort from quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, who led a second-half comeback with 362 passing yards and two TDs. Pete Golding – who replaced Lane Kiffin after the coach left for LSU – has a chance to lead the Rebels to the CFP championship game for the first time in school history.\n\nMiami (12-2) made a program statement with a 24-14 victory against No. 2 Ohio State in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic. Beck averages 120.5 passing yards with two TDs and no interceptions in two playoff games. Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor have led a nasty defense that has allowed 8.5 points through two playoff games. Mario Cristobal has a chance to push the Hurricanes to their first national championship game since 2003 – which was also at the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nMORE: Hurricane Bane is a Category 5 for Miami\n\nHere is an early look at the betting odds and our pick for the winner of the Fiesta Bowl. Odds courtesy of Caesars:\n\nMoneyline: Miami -160, Ole Miss +135\n\nOle Miss is 1-1 ATS as an underdog this season, and both games were against Georgia. The Rebels were 5-1 S/U in games with a spread of seven points or less. The Hurricanes are 2-0 S/U and 2-0 ATS when favored by seven points or less.\n\nMiami's pass rush wrecked the Ohio State game plan in the CFP quarterfinals. Bain has four of the Hurricanes' 12 sacks in the playoff. Mesidor has three sacks in those two games, and they have combined for 26 pressures.\n\nChambliss, however, presents a different challenge with his escapability outside the pocket. That pass rush will have to land, and Chambliss made Georgia pay with receivers Harrison Wallace III and De'Zhaun Stribling. How many risks will Chambliss take against a Miami secondary that features Bryce Fitzgerald (6 INTs), Jakobe Thomas (5 INTs) and Keionte Scott (2 INTs), who had the game-turning pick six against the Buckeyes?\n\nThe other piece is Kewan Lacy, a tough running back who has played through a shoulder injury the last two games. The Rebels are a different challenge for Miami defensive coordinator Corey Hetherman.\n\nMiami will attack Georgia with Mark Fletcher Jr., a tough inside runner who will try to attack the middle with defensive tackles Zxavian Harris and Will Echoles. Sunatrine Perkins and Princewell Umanmielen add to that pass rush. Malachi Toney and CJ Daniels will challenge the Ole Miss secondary in the intermediate passing game.\n\nHow will Beck handle the opportunity to get to the CFP championship game? Beck has thrown just one interception since the 26-20 loss to SMU on Nov. 1, and he has great protection from an offensive line led by Francis Mauigoa.\n\nMiami has not allowed more than 26 points in a game this season – but they have not faced a quarterback like Chambliss either. That is where this matchup will be decided. He passed for 300 or more yards in four of Ole Miss' last five games, and the Rebels are riding the same momentum wave as the Hurricanes. This makes for an almost impossible choice.\n\nSN AWARDS: 2025 All-America team | Player of the Year | Coach of the Year\n\nWhere Texas Tech-Oregon ranks among low-scoring CFP games\n\nYep, Arch Manning leads the 2026 Heisman race\n\nRanking top QBs in transfer portal",

    "fullText": "In a Sugar Bowl classic between two SEC teams fighting for a spot in the College Football Playoff semifinals, one of the biggest winners was in Baton Rouge. Financially, at least.\n\nLane Kiffin, the former Ole Miss coach who left the program last month for LSU, will receive a $500,000 bonus from his new employer thanks to his former team reaching the CFP semifinal via a thrilling 39-34 win over Georgia. The bonus is part of an agreement LSU reached with the coach to lure him from Oxford, offering him the same bonuses he would have received for each CFP victory had he stayed at Ole Miss.\n\nKiffin had already received a $250,000 bonus after the Rebels defeated Tulane in the first round. If they defeat No. 10 Miami in the next round, Kiffin will add another $750,000 to his tally.\n\nAnd if they were to win one more for the program’s first title in decades? One of the most bittersweet $1 million payments in the history of sports.\n\nPete Golding, the defensive coordinator who stayed at Ole Miss to take over as head coach, will receive the same bonuses. On his way out, Kiffin insisted on staying to coach the Rebels in the playoff, but the school understandably didn’t want a coach of another SEC team to be running its program during a key part of recruiting season.\n\nIt was an open question whether Kiffin would show up in New Orleans on Thursday to watch his former players and coaches face Georgia, but he decided to stick with his current school instead. He made an appearance on the court at the LSU women’s basketball team’s game, embracing head coach Kim Mulkey.\n\nNo. 5-ranked LSU took its first loss of the season, falling 80-78 to No. 11 Kentucky. After the game, it appears Kiffin did make it to New Orleans, or at least his family did.\n\nWhat a great finish!!! So much fun!! Only two more to go ⁦@OleMissFB⁩ 🇹🇹 🪄 🏆 #BTA pic.twitter.com/axTTTHP5pO\n\n— Lane Kiffin (@Lane_Kiffin) January 2, 2026\n\nMeanwhile, Ole Miss fans were making their thoughts about the man their team was enriching very clear, with a “F*** Lane Kiffin” chant at the end of the game. The state’s governor had a similar outlook.\n\n— Governor Tate Reeves (@tatereeves) January 2, 2026\n\nThis was a situation that was surreal from the moment Kiffin started taking other schools’ calls, and it won’t get any better with Ole Miss have a very real chance at the CFP championship game.",

    "fullText": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Trinidad Chambliss passed for 362 yards and two touchdowns, and Lucas Carneiro kicked his third field goal of the game with 6 seconds left to put No. 6 Mississippi in front for good in a 39-34 victory over third-ranked Georgia in a College Football Playoff in the Sugar Bowl on Thursday night.\n\nIn an unusual twist, the Ole Miss was awarded a safety on its final kickoff when Georgia’s return team tried a cross-field lateral that hit the pylon.\n\nGeorgia then recovered an onside kick and ran one more play in which they executed numerous laterals before the play fizzled, sending Ole Miss (13-1, CFP No. 6 seed) on to a semifinal against Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nKicking off on the heels of two lopsided CFP quarterfinals at the Orange and Rose bowls, the Sugar Bowl provided drama until the end.\n\nAfter seeing a 21-12 halftime lead turn into a 34-24 deficit with 9:02 to play, Georgia (12-2, CFP No. 3 seed) then rallied to tie it, first driving for Gunner Stockton’s 18-yard TD pass to Zachariah Branch before Peyton Woodring’s short field goal tied it with 55 seconds left in regulation.\n\nChambliss responded by setting up the winning kick with a 40-yard pass to De’Zhaun Stribling on third down from Mississippi’s own 30-yard line. A few plays later, Carneiro, who’d already broken Sugar Bowl records with field goals of 55 and 56 yards, hit from 47 and sprinted triumphantly toward the Ole Miss sideline as the Rebels (13-1, CFP No. 6 seed) jubilantly swarmed around him.",

    "fullText": "Behind a historic second-half performance from Trinidad Chambliss and a game-winning 47-yard field goal from Lucas Carneiro, No. 6 Mississippi was able to win a shootout and pull off the come-from-behind victory over No. 3 Georgia in the CFP Sugar Bowl quarterfinal on Thursday, Jan. 1, advancing to the CFP Fiesta Bowl semifinal.\n\nAnd the Rebels did it all without the coach who led them to their first-ever CFP berth in Lane Kiffin.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Georgia vs Ole Miss live updates, Trinidad Chambliss gives Rebels lead in Sugar Bowl\n\nChambliss set a new Sugar Bowl record by completing 13 consecutive passes, which included two ridiculous throws on the run to Kewan Lacey in the fourth quarter, before an incompletion on a batted down pass at the 6:19 mark of the fourth quarter. He finished 30-of-46 passes for 362 yards and two touchdown passes.\n\nThe Rebels' five-point win over the Bulldogs served to be the closest game of the CFP quarterfinals, and the closest game of the 2025-26 College Football Playoff. Next up for the Rebels will be No. 10 Miami in the CFP Fiesta Bowl semifinal on Thursday, Jan. 8 at 7:30 p.m. ET at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nGiven the nature of the upset and the fact Kiffin infamously left the Rebels before their CFP berth, social media didn't hold back when it decided to roast the current Tigers coach, who spent the day watching Kim Mulkey and the LSU women's basketball team get upset by Kentucky.\n\nHere's a snippet of those reactions:\n\nHere's a look at social media after Ole Miss' win over Georgia in the CFP Sugar Bowl quarterfinal:\n\nLegendary performance by Ole Miss.

    "fullText": "Twelve has been trimmed to four as the College Football Playoff heads into the national semifinals with No. 1 seed Indiana set to meet No. 5 Oregon in the Peach Bowl and No. 6 Ole Miss matched with No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nThe Hoosiers mauled No. 9 Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl behind another perfect game from Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza, who finished with more touchdown passes, three, than incompletions, two.\n\nThe Rebels dug out of a 21-12 halftime deficit and won 39-34 against No. 3 Georgia, pulling away late with a 47-yard field goal with six seconds left.\n\nOregon smothered No. 4 Texas Tech 23-0 in the Orange Bowl thanks to four turnovers by the Red Raiders, including a key end-zone interception by quarterback Behren Morton in the third quarter.\n\nIn the biggest upset of this year’s tournament, Miami outmuscled No. 2 Ohio State for a 24-14 win in the Cotton Bowl, sending the defending national champions into the offseason on a two-game losing streak.\n\nBefore turning to the next round, here are the biggest winners and losers from the quarterfinals:\n\nThey’re No. 1 in the nation for a reason. But for the doubters and cynics, this destruction of mighty Alabama makes a point that’s impossible to ignore: Indiana’s not just a great story but a potential juggernaut capable of beating the absolute snot out of any team in the tournament. More aggressive than the Tide, more physical, more composed and clearly better prepared, the Hoosiers showed zero rust after a month-long break after the Big Ten championship game. Build a time machine, go back a few years or so, find your younger self and whisper this sentence in your ear: Alabama just lost the Rose Bowl to Indiana by 35 points.\n\nNow 2-0 without Lane Kiffin, the Rebels avenged their one regular-season loss thanks to a brilliant night from senior Trinidad Chambliss, who had 362 yards passing and two touchdowns without an interception. Down 21-12 at halftime, Ole Miss began to take over in the third quarter and then delivered two key scores early in the fourth. Along the way to the game-winning field goal, the Rebels had to deal with several questionable penalty calls (or lack thereof) and needed to regain their composure after Georgia tied the game with a minute to go. That Ole Miss continues to defy the odds really speaks to new coach Pete Golding’s work keeping the team together.\n\nThe image of Oregon as a finesse program persists despite ample evidence to the contrary. The latest example was the Ducks’ shutout in the Orange Bowl, which saw the defense never allow the Red Raiders to come up for air in giving up just 215 yards on 3.5 yards per play. While the running game sputtered and gained just 64 yards, Oregon quarterback Dante Moore hit on 26 of 33 attempts for 234 yards. But the defense did the dirty work in this win, including not just that end-zone pick but a previous strip-sack fumble return earlier in the third quarter that set up the Ducks’ first touchdown.\n\nThe way Miami beat Ohio State matters. Going up against a team many expected to repeat and a defense that ranked first nationally in the major categories, the Hurricanes dictated the tempo and the tone by dominating the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. That was embodied during a five-minute drive late in the fourth quarter that helped Miami bury the Buckeyes. Matchups also matter in the postseason, and Miami might’ve met a friendly opponent in Ohio State’s slower playing style. But there’s no question after the Cotton Bowl that the Hurricanes have the ability to win two more games and the program’s first national championship since 2001.\n\nAlabama hadn’t lost by 30 or more points since 1998. The Crimson Tide were so clearly the inferior team – in talent, coaching, drive, toughness – that the 35-point loss wasn’t surprising, necessarily speaking. But that doesn’t make this any less embarrassing: After fighting back from 17 points down to beat Oklahoma in the opening round, Alabama never even put up a whisper of an argument against the Hoosiers and seemed happy to shut things down early in the second half and look toward next season. This was the program’s seventh loss in two years under coach Kalen DeBoer after dropping nine games across Nick Saban’s final six seasons.\n\nThere’s a question to be asked about how good Ohio State was, really, after losing to Indiana and Miami in its final two games. Yeah, the Buckeyes beat Texas, but that was in the season opener. Their next-best win came against Michigan. The defense was terrific all year but couldn’t get key stops against Miami, especially with the game on the line. The offensive line was great until these past two games, giving up five sacks to both Indiana and Miami after just six in the first 12 games. While plenty of talent is coming back to Columbus, Ohio State has to speed things up offensively after playing too sluggishly this season.\n\nThe Bulldogs seemed on the verge of delivering a knockout blow coming out of the half after a 21-point second quarter. To give back the game at that point underlines Georgia’s unpredictability even during a 12-1 regular season, especially with an offense that was better running the ball than in 2024 but often unable to put teams away. Georgia will be haunted by a great scoring opportunity late in the game, with the Rebels up 34-31: Second-and-goal at the 3-yard line turned into fouth-and-6 and the game-tying field goal instead of the go-ahead score. To not get six points was out of character for a team that came into the Sugar Bowl ranked third in the country with a 79.3% touchdown rate in the red zone.\n\nThe Orange Bowl was a bad look for the Big 12, which joined the ACC in sending just one team into the tournament but had that team ejected right off the bat while Miami has already claimed two playoff wins. The loss also comes after a postseason where Big 12 teams had earned bowl victories against teams from the ACC, SEC and the Big Ten. This still goes down as a banner season for Texas Tech despite the ugly way things ended against Oregon, though it’s clear the Red Raiders will need to reopen the pocketbooks to compile another playoff-worthy roster next season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: College Football Playoff winners, losers from quarterfinals",

The Rebels claim the 1960 national title after a 10-0-1 season that ended with a 14-6 Sugar Bowl win over Rice.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana and No. 5 Oregon? Neither team has a national title to its name.

Can the Hurricanes pressure Trinidad Chambliss the same way? Chambliss’ escapability was on full display against Georgia, especially in the second half. He showed how great of an improvisor he can be after Georgia’s pass rush flushed him from the pocket.\n\nThe Rebels’ win denied Miami QB Carson Beck the opportunity to play his old team for a shot at the national title.

Oregon’s win over Texas Tech was impressive but it could also have been a lot bigger. The Ducks’ offense squandered a lot of opportunities after getting into Texas Tech territory.",

The ESPN College GameDay crew overwhelmingly sided with Georgia to handle business against Ole Miss in the Sugar Bowl. The Bulldogs’ postseason experience, defensive strength and a regular season win in Athens weighed on many minds.\n\nThat confidence did not survive Thursday night in New Orleans.\n\nOle Miss stunned third-ranked Georgia 39-34 in a chaotic College Football Playoff quarterfinal that featured 30 combined fourth quarter points, multiple lead changes and one of the most unusual endings in bowl history. A safety on the final kickoff was the result of a desperate Georgia lateral that struck the pylon and sealed the Rebels’ victory. It sent them to the Fiesta Bowl for a semifinal matchup against Miami.\n\nNo love for Ole Miss #SugarBowl#CFBPlayoffpic.twitter.com/eJcNIRwSIF\n\n— Jeff Hauser (@radiohauser) January 2, 2026\n\nThe Rebels, now 13-1 and the CFP’s No. 6 seed, looked nothing like the underdog most of the pregame panel envisioned. Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss carved up the Bulldogs for 362 yards and two touchdowns, repeatedly answering Georgia rallies with poise and precision. His 40-yard strike to De’Zhaun Stribling on third down late in the fourth quarter set up Lucas Carneiro’s decisive 47-yard field goal with six seconds remaining.\n\nCarneiro was flawless all night, drilling three field goals, including Sugar Bowl-record kicks of 55 and 56 yards as Ole Miss totaled 473 yards of offense. Georgia finished with 355 yards but couldn’t come up with the final stop when it mattered.\n\nGeorgia had erased a 10-point deficit in the final minutes, tying the game on Peyton Woodring’s field goal with 55 seconds left.

(AP) — Alabama rallied from a 17-point deficit once in the College Football Playoff, but there would not be a repeat performance against No. 1 Indiana in a quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nThe Crimson Tide tried everything possible to stage a historic comeback on the site of so many memorable moments for the program, from a 1926 win that marked the arrival of southern football as a powerhouse on par with the rest of the country, to a 2024 overtime loss that would be legendary head coach Nick Saban's final game, but not even benching star quarterback Ty Simpson in the second half could provide a spark in a 38-3 loss to the Hoosiers.\n\nThe cracks that had been evident throughout a tumultuous season, from the shock opening loss to Florida State that only got worse as the year went on to why Alabama (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) found itself trailing by three scores against Oklahoma in the first round on Dec. 19, finally brought the inevitable conclusion for a talented, but flawed, team.\n\nWithout the benefit of any semblance of a running game, Simpson struggled to create big plays against Indiana's stout defense, going 12 of 16 for 67 yards and running for 17 yards with a lost fumble. The desperation to keep up with Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza had Alabama going for it on fourth down from its own 34 early in the second quarter, leading to an odd Wildcat pop pass that was stopped short.\n\nAustin Mack, who followed head coach Kalen DeBoer from Washington to Alabama before the 2024 season, took over late in the third quarter and managed a field goal on his first drive. That was as much as the third-year sophomore could muster, ending up 11 of 16 for 103 yards with three sacks.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "Biggest College Football Playoff blowouts: Here are the largest margins of victory in CFP history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe nature of the College Football Playoff is to pin the best teams in the country against one another, allowing debates over the best squad to be settled in the race for a national championship.\n\nWith 136 FBS teams, the selection process for the CFP can be controversial, but for the most part, only the elite teams wind up competing in the playoff bracket. Every once in a while though, that doesn't matter much, as a CFP matchup becomes a one-sided affair.\n\nFrom the 2023 national championship game, to some lighter first-round opponents in the first-ever 12-team CFP in 2024, there have been some significant blowouts in the history of college football's postseason.\n\nHere are the 13 biggest blowouts in the history of the College Football Playoff.\n\nMORE: How every Heisman Trophy winner fared in the NFL\n\nThe biggest blowout in CFP history came in a title game, as in 2023, Georgia bludgeoned TCU 65-7 to win the national championship. While the Horned Frogs had made the game by beating Michigan 51-45 in the semifinal, they found no such luck against the Bulldogs.\n\nThe 58-point victory for Georgia wasn't just the most lopsided win in a CFP title game; it marked the biggest win in any title game, and at the time, it was the largest margin of victory in any bowl game at the FBS level.\n\nAs the Bulldogs repeated as the champions and completed a 15-0 season, Stetson Bennett threw for 304 yards and four touchdowns, adding another two scores on the ground. Branson Robinson scored twice on the ground, Kendall Milton had a rushing touchdown, Ladd McConkey caught two touchdowns and Brock Bowers and Adonai Mitchell both caught one pass in the end zone — all while TCU scored just one first-quarter touchdown.\n\nMORE: Revisiting the infamous Uga-Bevo attack video with Texas and Georgia\n\nFinal Score: Oregon 59, Florida State 20\n\nA Pac-12-ACC matchup came in the 2015 Rose Bowl, as second-seeded Oregon took on third-seeded Florida State in Pasadena. Unfortunately for the Seminoles, the CFP semifinal game was all Ducks.\n\nOregon beat the defending national champs 59-20, advancing to the inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship Game. In the game, the Ducks totaled 639 total yards, including 301 rushing, breaking the record for the most points (59) scored in a Rose Bowl.\n\nMarcus Mariota had 338 passing yards, two touchdown passes, one interception and a rushing touchdown in the win, while Thomas Tyner and Royce Freeman added four more scores on the ground. The Ducks went on to fall by 22 points to Ohio State in the championship.\n\nMORE:Complete history of Lee Corso's College GameDay headgear picks\n\nFinal Score: Alabama 38, Michigan State 0\n\nAlabama was an established powerhouse under Nick Saban by 2015, and he continued flexing his coaching muscles in that year's College Football Playoff. Matched up against Michigan State in the semifinal, the Crimson Tide made light work of the Spartans.\n\nWhile most of Alabama's work was done in the second half, including Jake Coker's two touchdown passes to Calvin Ridley. Derrick Henry was his typical dominant self as well, running for 75 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAlabama picked off MSU quarterback Connor Cook twice, controlling the game from start to finish as it advanced to the title game.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 16 greatest Alabama players of all time\n\nFinal Score: LSU 63, Oklahoma 28\n\nThere's a reason the 2019 LSU Tigers are considered one of the best teams in college football history. In their semifinal playoff game, the Tigers exploded for 63 points against the country's fourth-ranked team, Oklahoma.\n\nEven by the end of the first quarter, LSU led 21-7, and by halftime, it was 49-14. The Sooners simply could not contain Joe Burrow and Ed Orgeron's offense; on the day, Burrow had 493 passing yards and an unreal seven touchdown passes, tying the NCAA records for touchdown passes in a half and touchdown passes in a bowl game. Burrow also ran for an eighth touchdown.\n\nJustin Jefferson caught four of Burrow's touchdowns, setting a College Football Playoff record, Terrace Marshall Jr. had two and Thaddeus Moss had another.\n\nMORE: Most NFL Draft picks by a school in one year\n\nFinal Score: Indiana 38, Alabama 3\n\nTo open their 2026 College Football Playoff run, Indiana, one of the all-time worst football programs in college football history, was tasked with one of the best all-time programs: Alabama. History didn't matter very much in the CFP quarterfinal game.\n\nIndiana stampeded through Alabama, 38-3, stymying Kalen DeBoer's offense all day while Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes. The Hoosiers advanced to the semifinal with the victory, becoming the title favorite with defending champion Ohio State's loss.\n\nAlabama totaled just three points all day in the 2026 Rose Bowl for one of the biggest playoff blowouts ever.\n\nMORE: Where Indiana ranks among all-time losing CFB programs\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 31, Ohio State 0\n\nThere's only two shutouts on this list of CFP blowouts, and one came in 2016, when Clemson decimated Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl, which was a playoff semifinal game.\n\nUrban Meyer coached his unit to a 31-0 win, scoring in all four quarters while his defense didn't allow a single point to the Buckeyes. Despite Deshaun Watson's two interceptions, he also ran for two scores and threw for another.\n\nOhio State registered just nine first-downs all night, with quarterback J.T. Barrett throwing a pair of interceptions as Clemson moved onto the championship.\n\nMORE:The 7 biggest national championship upsets ever\n\nFinal Score: Ole Miss 41, Tulane 10\n\nTulane had a hard time keeping up with Ole Miss in the first round of the playoff in 2025, letting up two quick touchdown drives to start the game and only finding the end zone once in a 41-10 loss.\n\nThe Green Wave actually racked up more than 400 yards of offense, but they struggled to finish drives, turned the ball over three times and slipped up again defensively in the second half after a promising finish to the first half.\n\nOle Miss totaled 497 yards of offense in the win, including 346 passing yards with Trinidad Chambliss in full command.\n\nFinal Score: Penn State 38, SMU 10\n\nIn the first year of the 12-team CFP, Penn State earned the right to host a first-round game in Beaver Stadium, and the opposing environment did not go well for the SMU Mustangs. They were blown out, 38-10, as the Nittany Lions moved onto the quarterfinals.\n\nPenn State's first offensive score didn't come until the five-minute mark of the second quarter, but James Franklin's team was already up multiple scored by then — SMU quarterback Kevin Jennings threw two pick-sixes in the first half.\n\nThe Mustangs didn't find the end zone until the fourth quarter, and even on a day where quarterback Drew Allar had just 127 yards and no touchdowns, Penn State rolled to a CFP win.\n\nMORE: How Penn State's 'White Out' became an annual tradition\n\nFinal Score: Alabama 52, Ohio State 24\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide capped a perfect season with a huge win over Ohio State in the 2021 CFP championship, scoring 35 points in the first half alone to coast against the Buckeyes.\n\nAll night, the Crimson Tide offense was on fire — quarterback Mac Jones threw for 464 yards and five touchdown passes, running back Najee Harris scored three times, and Heisman Trophy winning-receiver Devonta Smith took his 12 catches for 215 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe Buckeyes were playing keep-up from the start, and Alabama won yet another national title under Nick Saban.\n\nMORE: Revisiting Alabama's loaded 2015 coaching staff\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 44, Alabama 16\n\nAlabama came into the 2019 title game as the No. 1-ranked team, but the final score said otherwise. The second-ranked Clemson Tigers had no issues en route to a 15-0 record and national title, winning by 28 points.\n\nTrevor Lawrence had a clean 347 passing yards and three touchdown passes, which went to Justyn Ross, Tee Higgins and Travis Etienne, who also scored twice on the ground. Dabo Swinney's squad used 17 second-quarter points to build its advantage.\n\nClemson won its second national title in three years with its blowout win.\n\nMORE: Where is Clemson located?\n\nFinal Score: Clemson 30, Notre Dame 3\n\nIn a CFP semifinal game, Clemson came in and routed Notre Dame in the 2018 Cotton Bowl in Arlington, Texas. The Tigers, who also went on to blow out Alabama in the championship game, walked away with a dominant 30-3 win over the Fighting Irish.\n\nClemson entered with a 13-0 record behind quarterback Trevor Lawrence, and even a suspension for three players, including starting defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence, coming into the game didn't slow the Tigers down.\n\nOf Clemson's 30 points, 27 went unanswered from the first-quarter on. Lawrence threw touchdown passes to Justyn Ross (2) and Tee Higgins, then Travis Etienne put a cap on the win with a 62-yard touchdown run in the third quarter.\n\nMORE: Why are LSU and Clemson both called 'Death Valley'?\n\nFinal Score: Ohio State 42, Tennessee 17\n\nIn hindsight, the fact that Ohio State was the No. 9 seed in the 2024 College Football Playoff bracket looks laughable, but the eventual-champion Buckeyes faced significant questions coming onto the playoff after losing their regular-season finale to Michigan.\n\nHowever, Ryan Day's unit came out and dominated to open the CFP, cruising to a 21-0 start in the first quarter against Josh Huepel's Tennessee squad.\n\nThe Buckeyes advanced to the quarterfinals with a 42-17 win as quarterback Will Howard threw for 311 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, freshman phenom Jeremiah Smith caught two touchdown passes with 103 yards, and running backs TreVeyson Henderson and Quinshon Judkins both scored twice.\n\nMORE: The history of Ohio State coaches' records vs. Michigan\n\nFinal Score: Georgia 34, Michigan 11\n\nAt the 2021 Orange Bowl, Georgia met Michigan for one of the two CFP semifinal games. And on New Year's Eve, it was all Bulldogs.\n\nKirby Smart and Georgia, which would go on to beat Alabama in the title game, took down Jim Harbaugh's Wolverines by 23 points, getting out to a 27-3 lead by halftime and winning 34-11.\n\nStetson Bennett threw for 310 yards and three touchdowns in the win, throwing his scoring passes to Brock Bowers, James Cook and Jermaine Burton.\n\nMORE: Georgia's timeline of trouble under Kirby Smart\n\nHere's a look at the past CFP national title winners.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about College Football Playoff format",

During their sole previous Rose Bowl appearance in 1968, the Hoosiers lost to USC.\n\nIndiana’s football program spent most of its time stuck in the Big Ten conference basement, but that era is over.\n\nNow, with new blood infused by head coach Curt Cignetti and an offense led by Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza, the Hoosiers have turned the page and shattered expectations.\n\nAfter a quarter of brushing off their rust following a three-week break, No. 1 Indiana rolled to a 38-3 Rose Bowl victory over No. 9 Alabama Thursday afternoon in front of a crowd of 90,278. It is the largest postseason margin of defeat in Crimson Tide history.\n\n\"We've come through in clutch moments,\" Cignetti said during his ESPN postgame interview. \"I'm proud of the way they've responded.\"\n\nIndiana scored its first touchdown on a 21-yard pass from Mendoza to Charlie Becker to make it 10-0. It was the first touchdown scored by a Hoosier at the Rose Bowl in program history, the perfect way to establish Indiana’s domination.\n\nIndiana’s defense established its dominance during a pivotal stretch in the second quarter when Alabama could not afford to let the Hoosiers stretch their lead.\n\nFacing fourth-and-one at the Alabama 34, Indiana coach Curt Cignetti called timeout when it was clear the Tide were in a trick play formation. After the timeout, Alabama tried to get the Indiana defense to jump offsides but couldn’t get a penalty and burned a timeout of its own. The teams lined up one more time on fourth down, with Crimson Tide running back Daniel Hill passing to receiver Germie Bernard. Indiana’s Isaiah Jones and Rolijah Hardy combined to stuff Bernand for no gain and a game-defining turnover on downs.\n\nHoosiers fans celebrated the early success after taking over the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day. The sea of cherry red fans planted their flag and made themselves heard. Any time the word Alabama was mentioned, Indiana fans booed and asserted homefield advantage. With the skies clearing after a morning of heavy rain, Hoosiers joyously broke out “Who’s your daddy?” chants.\n\nCignetti kept taking jabs at the Tide defense with heavy use of the run game early in the contest. When it was his turn to pass, Mendoza was nearly perfect. He finished 14 of 16 passing for 192 yards and three touchdowns. He was sacked three times, but Mendoza never turned the ball over.\n\nMendoza contributed to the strong Indiana run game, frustrating the gashed Tide defense. With all his receivers covered, he scrambled for a back-breaking eight-yard run in the third quarter to tighten Indiana’s control of the game.\n\nThe following play, Mendoza threw a 24-yard touchdown to Elijah Sarrat to make it 24-0. He finished with 38 rushing yards.\n\nEntering the game, Indiana wanted to contain Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson. He gave up a critical first-half fumble and struggled to find seams in the Indiana defense. Tide coach Kalen DeBoer eventually benched Simpson, who had been limited by injuries part of this season, at halftime.\n\nCrimson Tide second-string quarterback Austin Mack finished the game with 103 passing yards. Simpson finished the game with 67. Mack threw a 34-yard pass to Bernard in the third quarter, which led to a 28-yard field goal that made the score 24-3.\n\nThe Hoosiers tacked on a Kaelon Black 25-yard rushing touchdown to make it 31-3. He finished the game with 99 yards and one touchdown.\n\nAs clouds dissipated, the Hoosiers booked their ticket to the Peach Bowl, where they will face Oregon in their pursuit of the ultimate team award – the national championship.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

The Crimson Tide (11-4; No. 11 AP, No. 9 CFP) then found early success with two quick first downs into Hoosiers’ territory before the defense stepped up to force a punt.\n\nFrom there, Indiana came to life, taking a 17-0 halftime lead on a 31-yard field goal by Nicolas Radicic and two touchdown passes from Mendoza. Avoiding an early deficit was crucial, as it had been something of a constant in the previous losses by idle teams.\n\nThe Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-0 hole at the break against the Hurricanes, and the Red Raiders allowed 104 yards to the Ducks while gaining minus-2 yards in the first quarter. In last year's Granddaddy of Them All, Oregon gave up the first 34 points in a 41-21 loss to eventual national champion Ohio State.\n\nNot spotting Alabama an early advantage allowed Indiana to continue playing to its strengths and eventually wear down the SEC at-large participant.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes, Indiana’s defense thoroughly throttled Alabama, and the top-seeded Hoosiers roared into the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 38-3 victory in the 112th Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nMendoza passed for 192 yards in his first game since winning his school’s first Heisman Trophy, but the hard-nosed Hoosiers (14-0, No. 1 CFP seed) won the Rose Bowl for the first time in school history by dominating the Crimson Tide (11-4, No. 9 CFP seed) at the line of scrimmage.\n\nIndiana scored the game’s first 24 points before pouring it on with fourth-quarter rushing TDs from Kaelon Black and Roman Hemby, wrapping up a jubilant win in the 112th edition of the Granddaddy of Them All.\n\nCharlie Becker, Omar Cooper Jr. and Elijah Sarratt caught TD passes, while Black rushed for 99 yards. Indiana outgained Alabama 407-193, steadily delighting a decidedly pro-Indiana crowd that celebrated its long-struggling team’s first Rose Bowl game appearance since 1968 with chants of “Hoosier Daddy?” in the final minutes.\n\nIndiana had not won any bowl game since the Copper Bowl in 1991, but history has been no match for Curt Cignetti and his dominant Hoosiers during the coach’s two transcendent seasons.\n\nThe Hoosiers are headed to the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9 for a CFP semifinal rematch with fifth-seeded Oregon, which routed Texas Tech 23-0 earlier Thursday in the Orange Bowl. Indiana beat the then-No. 3 Ducks 30-20 in Eugene last October in one of Cignetti’s most impressive Big Ten victories.\n\nIndiana is two wins away from the first national championship in school history after becoming the first team to advance following a first-round bye in the current 12-team playoff format. The first six bye teams — including the first two this season — couldn’t come back strong from an extra-long layoff, but the Hoosiers took care of business while improving to 25-2 under Cignetti.\n\nThe Crimson Tide’s second season under Kalen DeBoer ended in the same venue as their final season under Nick Saban two years ago. Alabama was outclassed one week after an impressive road win over Oklahoma, managing just 151 yards before the meaningless final minutes of this blowout.\n\nTy Simpson passed for 67 yards before backup Austin Mack replaced him in the third quarter. Mack immediately got the Tide rolling on a 65-yard drive leading to a short field goal, but the Hoosiers responded with two unstoppable TD drives.\n\nIndiana dominated the famous Rose Bowl turf, which stayed pristine despite nearly 24 hours of steady rain before kickoff. The storms dissipated while the Hoosiers took their first-half lead, and blue skies appeared in the second half.\n\nAfter the first scoreless first quarter in a Rose Bowl in 26 years, Indiana’s second drive stretched 84 yards and 16 plays over nearly nine minutes before Nicolas Radicic’s 31-yard field goal on the first snap of the second quarter.\n\nIndiana’s defense then stopped Alabama on fourth and 1 at the Tide 34, and Mendoza fired a long, high pass to the leaping Becker four plays later for a 21-yard touchdown.\n\nSimpson fumbled in Indiana territory after a courageous first-down scramble late in the first half, and the Hoosiers methodically drove for Mendoza’s 1-yard TD pass with 17 seconds left to Cooper, the hero of Indiana’s dramatic victory over Penn State.\n\nAfter halftime, Mendoza led a steady 79-yard drive ending in his 24-yard TD pass to the leaping Sarratt.\n\nThe victory is the latest step in the monumental two-season turnaround of what was the losingest program in college football when Cignetti took charge. After winning 11 games and reaching the CFP last season, the Hoosiers steamrolled through their schedule this fall before beating defending national champion Ohio State for the Big Ten title and ascending to the No. 1 spot in the AP Top 25 for the first time.\n\nAlabama: It was remarkable to see the most successful program of the 21st century get dominated up front. The Tide’s inability to run the ball was a season-long problem, but it was particularly painful in Pasadena. Whether through personnel or scheme, DeBoer’s offense must take a step forward next year to reach the standard expected at Bama.\n\nIndiana: The Hoosiers acted like they’ve been here before, even though they haven’t. Cignetti’s group has a businesslike demeanor that wasn’t remotely altered by Alabama’s reputation and history.\n\nAlabama: Host East Carolina on Sept. 5.\n\nIndiana: A trip to Atlanta to face the powerhouse Ducks, who lost last season’s Rose Bowl to Ohio State as the No. 1 seed.",

    "fullText": "The New Year’s Day College Football Playoff tripleheader wraps up with the Mississippi Rebels facing the Georgia Bulldogs in the Sugar Bowl.\n\nThis matchup is a rematch of a regular-season instant classic, one Georgia won behind a stunning fourth-quarter comeback. Ole Miss hasn’t lost since, however, and even without Lane Kiffin on the sideline, the Rebels rolled Tulane in the opening round.\n\nWill Kiffin’s absence finally show in tonight's CFP quarterfinal?\n\nMy Mississippi vs. Georgia predictions and college football picks break down the matchup and deliver the best bets for the Sugar Bowl on Thursday, January 1.\n\nThis will be a close game, but Georgia will come out on top. Kirby Smart and the Dawgs’ big-game experience will be the difference at the end of the day.\n\nWell, that and that relentless Georgia rushing attack.\n\nThe Mississippi Rebels passed their first test without Lane Kiffin with flying colors, absolutely crushing the Tulane Green Wave 41-10 in the first round of the College Football Playoff. But their first real challenge comes in the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day against their SEC rivals, the Georgia Bulldogs.\n\nThe Bulldogs were the last team to defeat the Rebels, winning an epic comeback 43-35 on October 18, in a game that saw Georgia outscore Mississippi 17-0 in the fourth quarter.\n\nNow, Georgia has won nine in a row, which includes avenging its lone loss of the season by defeating rival Alabama in the SEC Championship Game in dominant fashion.\n\nBut while the Bulldogs are rolling, it doesn’t mean they aren’t vulnerable. This isn’t the Georgia team of years past, which had historically good defenses. The Dawgs are good, just not great. And good passing teams have been a problem.\n\nGeorgia ranks 55th in defensive success rate on dropbacks and 63rd in opponent points per quality drive. And led by QB Trinidad Chambliss, the Rebels are a quality offense.\n\nChambliss didn’t begin the season as Mississippi’s starter, but he’s left no doubt about who’s the man since taking over. The Rebels rank ninth in EPA per play and 15th in offensive success rate and are seventh in both EPA and success rate on dropbacks.\n\nBut what makes this Mississippi offense more of a problem for Georgia than, say, Alabama, is its balance.\n\nWith star running back Kewan Lacy complementing Chambliss, the Rebels can be hard for anyone to slow down, especially with offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. staying with the team.\n\nGeorgia's still a very good team and has the edge in big-game coaching and experience. And while that could be the difference in who wins the Sugar Bowl,  Mississippi will make the Bulldogs work for it and keep this game close.\n\nWith Chambliss being the key to the outcome of the Sugar Bowl, it only makes sense that he is the focus of this SGP.\n\nIn 11 games as the starter, Chambliss threw for 3,239 yards with 18 touchdowns and just three interceptions. He also added 485 yards and another eight scores on the ground. In the last meeting against Georgia, he threw for 263 yards and two TDs, rushed for 42 yards, and scored two more TDs.\n\nHis dynamic ability is a problem for anyone to stop. So, let’s go Over 247.5 passing yards, which he has done in 10 of his 11 starts, and add him to score an anytime touchdown.\n\nTrinidad Chambliss Over 247.5 passing yards\n\nTrinidad Chambliss anytime touchdown\n\nTo make this a deep ball SGP, let's take Chambliss from finding the end zone not just once, but multiple times in the Sugar Bowl.\n\nTrinidad Chambliss Over 247.5 passing yards\n\nSpread: Mississippi +6.5 | Georgia -6.5\n\nMoneyline: Mississippi +190 | Georgia -230\n\nOver/Under: Over 55.5 | Under 55.5\n\nMississippi has covered the Spread in nine of its last 13 games for +4.60 Units and a 32% ROI.

Oregon, meanwhile, took care of James Madison 51-34 at home in the first round.\n\nBoth of these teams have high-powered offenses. Oregon quarterback Dante Moore has the Ducks humming, averaging 39.2 points per game, good for ninth nationally. Tech's offense is equally explosive and has the nation's No. 2 scoring offense, led by signal-caller Behren Morton.\n\nThis game could come down to whichever defense gets off the field quicker. Both teams are also quite solid. Texas Tech allows just 254.4 yards per game, ranking third nationally in total defense. Oregon, meanwhile, gives up 271.4 per game. Another big factor to keep an eye on this one is turnovers. Texas Tech's defense has forced 31 turnovers this year, which leads the FBS. In Oregon's lone 30-20 loss to Indiana earlier this season, the Ducks had two turnovers.\n\nOregon is looking to prove it's a legitimate playoff contender, despite getting embarrassed in last year's quarterfinal round against Ohio State. Texas Tech, meanwhile, is on the CFP for the first time in school history, and looking to show it's right where it's supposed to be.\n\nWe should be in for a great one in Miami, Fla.

Alabama — the program that defined a dynasty for multiple generations — an underdog? Indiana — a team that hadn't won an outright conference title in 80 years before 2025 — the behemoth? It’s a parallel universe warped by the sheer force of the Hoosiers' ascendance, and yet, here we stand in Pasadena, preparing for the most upside-down clash the Granddaddy of Them All has ever hosted.\n\nThe landscape of college football has been altered by the arrival of Curt Cignetti in Bloomington, who, in a shockingly short period, has turned the Hoosiers into a national power. Cignetti’s 26-2 record in just two seasons has shattered every previous standard for coaching success in Bloomington. Behind the play of Heisman-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza, Indiana didn't just win the Big Ten; they steamrolled it, capping their 13-0 run with a defensive masterpiece against the reigning national champion Ohio State. This is a program with an elite defense, a dominating rushing attack, and a self-assured belief that they are three precious victories away from the first national title in school history.\n\nFor Alabama, head coach Kalen DeBoer — who inherited the impossible task of succeeding Nick Saban — has guided the Crimson Tide through a season of uncharacteristic struggles. Alabama scraped its way into the Playoff with three losses, proving its championship mettle in a first-round victory over Oklahoma where the Tide came back from down 17-0 on the road. Yet, the prevailing whisper in Pasadena remains: you can never count out the Tide, no matter the circumstances.\n\nWhen the College Football Playoff quarterfinal kicks off on Thursday at the Rose Bowl, the stunning reality will finally sink in: The No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers are the gatekeepers to the national semifinals. Standing in their way, playing the role of spoiler and proving that the Tide still rolls, are the No. 9 Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nThis is not just a game; it is a cultural collision. The football blue blood of the South, synonymous with unparalleled gridiron excellence, faces off against the basketball blue blood of the Midwest, which now finds itself as the newest college football powerhouse. This is a clash of legacies, a battle of coaches, and a dizzying moment of truth for a sport that has not witnessed a disruption quite like the Hoosiers’ takeover.\n\nSTREAM:Watch Alabama vs. Indiana live with Fubo (free trial)\n\nSN's PLAYOFF HQ: Live CFP scores | Updated CFP bracket | Full CFP schedule\n\nThis section will be updated closer to kickoff on Jan. 1, 2026.\n\nAlabama vs. Indiana weather updates from rainy Rose Bowl\n\nCurt Cignetti's best quotes at Indiana\n\nMeet Fernando Mendoza's brother, Indiana's heir apparent at QB\n\nHow Indiana went from most losses in college football to No. 1 ranking\n\nTime: 4p.m. ET, 1 p.m. local time\n\nThe Grandaddy of them all will take place on New Year's Day, as it does every year, maintaining its century-old tradition as the oldest and most iconic bowl game.\n\nThe 112th edition between Alabama and Indiana will kick off at 4:00 p.m. ET and 1:00 p.m. local time.\n\nThe Rose Bowl will be broadcast nationally on ESPN.

    "description": "Our free college football picks expect Texas State to flaunt their class vs. Rice in the Armed Forces Bowl. Free Rice vs. Texas State predictions for January 2, 2026.",
    "fullText": "The last day of bowl season kicks off on Tuesday morning in Fort Worth, TX, as the Rice Owls face the Texas State Bobcats in the Armed Forces Bowl at Amon G. Carter Stadium.\n\nRice is one of three 5-7 teams featuring in a bowl game, and my Rice vs. Texas State predictions believe the Owls are up against it, facing a quality Texas State team that is better than its 6-6 record indicates.\n\nRead on for my college football picks for Friday, January 2.\n\nTexas State will win this game and move to 7-6. The Bobcats suffered many close and heartbreaking defeats this season, but they’re still a solid team headed in the right direction under G.J. Kinne. This isn’t the kind of squad that has any business flirting with a losing record, whereas Rice is guaranteed to finish below .500.\n\nThe Rice Owls arrive in bowl season thanks to their APR Score and not anything that they’ve done on the football field. They clawed their way to five wins, but Scott Abell’s squad still has a lot of work to do before it can be considered a quality football team.\n\nThe Texas State Bobcats, on the other hand, have much more impressive metrics than you’d expect from a 6-6 team playing in the Group of 5.\n\nThe offense ranks Top 10 in EPA per play, led by star quarterback Brad Jackson (3,742 total yards, 34 TDs), workhorse running back Lincoln Pare (1,328 scrimmage yards, 13 TDs), and star receivers Beau Sparks and Chris Dawn Jr. (combined 2,044 yards, 11 TDs) behind a quality offensive line.\n\nThat potent unit will be close to full strength for this bowl game with no announced opt-outs as of December 31. They should exploit a beatable Rice defense that allowed more explosive plays than any other team in the country and checks in at 118th in EPA per play.\n\nOn the flip side, Rice will be without starting quarterback Chase Jenkins, and perhaps two of its top skill position players (wideout Drayden Dickmann and running back Daelen Alexander).\n\nThis unit was already bad (114th in success rate) and wants to keep the ball on the ground (fourth in rush rate), which might prove difficult against a Texas State defense ranking 55th in rush defense grade per PFF.\n\nThis is one of the highest totals we’ve seen in a Rice game all season, so my natural inclination is to bite the bullet and play the Under. The Owls play at a very slow pace (118th in snaps per minute) and simply aren’t built to play from behind or get into a shootout, which the game script calls for.\n\nThe defense will give up plenty, but that probably happens early in the ball game. Kinne will simply want to get his team out of Fort Worth with a victory, and can likely do so by a sizable margin even if he has his team cool the jets in the second half.\n\nSpread: Rice +14.5 | Texas State -14.5\n\nMoneyline: Rice +560 | Texas State -800\n\nOver/Under: Over 56.5 | Under 56.5\n\nRice is 2-5 ATS in its last seven games.

Here are my picks for the New Year's slate of playoff games:\n\nMiami is having its best season in 23 years. But Ohio State is simply too good for the Hurricanes to overcome.\n\nWith Miami and Texas Tech both losing, we get a semifinals consisting solely of SEC and Big Ten teams—yet another sign that those two conferences are a clear tier above the rest.\n\nIndiana beats Alabama in the Rose Bowl, and it isn't considered an upset. Imagine telling that to someone from pretty much any other year in college football history.\n\nOle Miss lost to Georgia earlier this season with Lane Kiffin. The Rebels suffer the same fate without him\n\nBased on my above predictions, we would get the following matchups in the semifinals:\n\n-Fiesta Bowl: (3) Georgia vs. (2) Ohio State\n\n-Peach Bowl: (5) Oregon vs. (1) Indiana\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Trojans Wire's Adam Bradford picks CFP quarterfinals",

    "fullText": "The Oregon Ducks have been waiting for this moment for exactly one year.\n\nThe last time the calendar switched over to a new year, the Ducks went to the Rose Bowl, where Ohio State swiftly bounced them out of the College Football Playoff. Although the opponent and site are different, Dan Lanning's crew is looking for some redemption.\n\nThis time, it will be Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl for Oregon in the quarterfinals of this postseason. Should they win, the Ducks will go on to the Peach Bowl in Atlanta to face either Alabama and their old nemesis Kalen DeBoer or Indiana, the team that handed Oregon its only loss this year.\n\nThe Red Raiders aren't a pushover, however, and the Ducks will have to play well in order to move on. Texas Tech is 12-1 and is the Big XII champion. They have a formidable offense and defense. All 12 of their victories have been over a 20-point margin. Playing in a close game or from behind isn't their forte. The Ducks are hoping to do just that and are counting on their past success in the Big Ten to carry them through on New Year's Day.\n\nIt's been almost two weeks since Oregon defeated James Madison 51-34 and are even more healthy going into this game with Texas Tech. But receiver Evan Stewart, who has been out all year and speculated to be available for this game, has been listed as out. Other than that, the Duck offense should be running on full cylinders against a very good Red Raider defense.\n\nOregon vs. Texas Tech will be broadcast nationally on ESPN in the Orange Bowl and the quarterfinals of the College Football Playoff, with the winner moving on to play either Alabama or Indiana in the Peach Bowl in Atlanta Jan. 9. The game will feature play-by-play announcer Joe Tessitore and analyst Jesse Palmer, along with sideline reporters Katie George and Stormy Buonantony. Fans can stream on ESPN+.\n\nLocation: Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, FL.\n\nThe Oregon Ducks vs. Texas Tech Red Raiders game starts at 9:00 a.m. PST on Jan. 1, 2026, in Miami Gardens, FL.\n\nOdds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook as of Wednesday, Dec. 31\n\nMoneyline: Oregon -134, Texas Tech +114\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: How to watch Oregon vs Texas Tech, streaming and betting info",

    "description": "Nigel Williams said that college-aged applicants should demonstrate their relationship-building skills.",
    "fullText": "Last year, BlackRock accepted less than 3% of the people who applied for its early-career programs. Nigel Williams, the firm's head of talent acquisition, has a few pieces of advice for those hoping to nab one of the coveted acceptance letters.\n\nWilliams said that college students interested in working at the asset management behemoth should do four things before preparing for an interview: research the firm, have a personal elevator pitch, brainstorm specific examples of success, and reach out to an employee beforehand.\n\nWith their \"elevator pitch,\" Williams said, applicants should explain what's important to them, where they excel, and how they've overcome difficulties or solved problems.\n\n\"Why would you be great for the company? Being able to give an example, be specific,\" Williams said, adding that general statements don't tend to land as well.\n\nResearching the firm will help applicants anchor their chosen examples in what BlackRock in particular is looking for. Part of what defines the firm, Williams said, is relationship-building. Many applicants know or reach out to someone who works at BlackRock before the interview to learn about the company culture, he said.\n\nLast year, more than 60,000 people applied for the early-career programs, and BlackRock offered some 1,500 jobs globally for its internship and program analyst positions. Every applicant completes a one-way HireVue interview.\n\nFor those who do make it further into the application process, Williams said he's always interested in learning about \"what makes people tick,\" whether by having them talk through what they've learned from solving a challenging situation, or asking about what they would have done differently.\n\nAs BlackRock continues to accelerate its technological prowess, Williams also said that AI has transformed his hiring process. Strong applicants can demonstrate both their fluency with AI tools and prompting, and their interpersonal skills.\n\nWhen it comes to younger talent, Williams said he's not just looking for a certain GPA or major, but also those who are engaged in their school communities. BlackRock has, for example, had a lot of success when hiring student athletes.\n\nOf those who do make it into the summer intern program, around 75% receive offers to return as analysts after graduating from college, which may be especially helpful in a brutal job market for young talent.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHow would you grade what Miami defensive end Rueben Bain and the Hurricanes' defense brought to the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic?\n\nTry \"Category 5.\" That is how Miami legend Michael Irvin described the Hurricanes from the sideline during the first half.\n\n\"Category 5 you can't even hunker down in,\" Irvin screamed from the sidelines in the first half. \"All s— get torn up.'\n\n\"Hurricane Rueben\" tore it up, all right. Defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. was the center of the Miami storm that overtook AT&T Stadium. He made that kind of impact in the first half and when it mattered most in the fourth quarter for the Hurricanes.\n\nNo. 10 Miami beat No. 2 Ohio State 24-14 on Wednesday in the biggest College Football Playoff upset ever – a payback receipt from the 2003 BCS championship game the program had been dying to redeem.\n\nRemember, No. 2 Ohio State upset No. 1 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3, 2003 – a game that featured 52 future NFL Draft picks. The Buckeyes took the mantle as a perennial national championship contender that night, too.\n\nIt was a role reversal this time.The Buckeyes (12-2) were the defending national champion. Ohio State allowed 8.2 points per game and had at least one consensus All-American at every level of their defense, including Kayden McDonald, Arvell Reese and Caleb Downs.\n\nMORE: Who does Miami face next?\n\nThey just didn't have Bain. The Hurricanes (12-2) out-flanked the Ohio State offense and Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin – who took five sacks in the loss. Bain – a consensus All-American – led that defense to the CFP semifinals at the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 8 – one step closer to a championship appearance at their home field in Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.\n\nMiami will face either No. 3 Georgia (12-1) or No. 6 Ole Miss (12-1) in the CFP semifinals, and that promises to be another \"rock fight\" which coach Mario Cristobal has embraced. He was asked about that physical play on the ESPN telecast afterward.\n\n\"Our guys have really worked on being a physical, violent bunch and you know what?\" Cristobal said before stopping himself. \"Coach Johnson!\"\n\nThat's Jimmy Johnson, of course, the coach who led Miami to a national championship in 1987. Irivin, Johnson, Ray Lewis and all the legends from that heyday witnessed the next Hurricanes' icon at work.\n\nBain made his presence felt in the first quarter when he set the edge by pushing Ohio State guard Austin Siereveld into running back Bo Jackson for a tackle for loss.\n\nRUEBEN BAIN JR. MADE THE TACKLE WHILE BEING BLOCKED 😳 pic.twitter.com/wlP4Tojdvm\n\n— ACC Network (@accnetwork) January 1, 2026\n\nBain had a sack in the second quarter, and edge rusher Akheem Mesidor added two sacks. That dynamic pass-rushing tandem kept the Buckeyes out of sorts for the first half. Bain shielded Sayin by jumping into the air on a screen pass, which defensive back Keionte Scott jumped and took 72 yards for a TD and a 14-0 lead with 11:49 left in the second quarter.\n\nThe Hurricanes limited the Buckeyes to 154 yards – including minus-three rushing yards – in the first half. Miami quarterback Carson Beck meanwhile, hit 14 of 18 passes for 98 yards and a touchdown.\n\nOhio State struck back in the second half. Sayin heated up, the Buckeyes had two TD drives of 11 and 10 plays, respectively, and cut the lead to 17-14 on a 14-yard TD pass to Jeremiah Smith with 13:28 remaining in the fourth quarter. Bain had been mostly quiet to that point, other than drawing a double team that set up a sack by Wesley Bissainthe.\n\nWhen the Buckeyes got the ball back, Bain stepped up again. After a third-and-15 conversion to Smith, Bain drew a holding penalty. Then he chased Sayin into a check-down that forced a punt. That was the defining sequence of the fourth quarter. Bain was relentless.\n\nThey say if you can’t get pressure rushing 4 then you aren’t a great defensive line, well Rueben Bain Jr. just got to the QB while rushing 3.\n\nTop-10 pick, explosiveness is other worldly and his speed is devious pic.twitter.com/6lm5Y0GRPW\n\n— BKS Sports (@BKSecretsports) January 1, 2026\n\nMiami drove 70 yards for the game-sealing TD – a 5-yard TD run by CharMar Brown. The Hurricanes had their biggest win since the 37-14 victory against No. 2 Nebraska at the 2002 BCS championship at the Rose Bowl.\n\nThis isn't that team. Those Hurricanes' teams had a lineage of seen-on-Sunday legends. This one is built around Beck – who finished 19 of 26 for 138 yards and running back Mark Fletcher Jr., who had 19 rushing attempts for 90 yards. Bain and Mesidor led the defense, and it was impressive.\n\nSayin finished 22 of 35 for 287 yards, a TD and two interceptions. Smith – a Miami, native – had seven catches for 157 yards and a TD. Yet the Buckeyes had just 24 rushing attempts for 45 yards. They also didn't have the best player in this playoff.\n\nThat is Bain. He has four of Miami's 12 sacks in two playoff games. He has to be in consideration to be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, and with this defense the Hurricanes have a legitimate chance for a national championship for the first time since that fateful night in Tempe, Ariz. Now, the Hurricanes are back, and a SEC semifinalist is next.",

Day hasn't called plays for the Buckeyes in a couple of years, but the head coach is no stranger to calling plays as a head coach.\n\nIn the first half against, Day's return to play-calling couldn't have gone much worse. Ohio State was shutout for the first time in since the 2016 CFP semifinals against Clemson, and to make matters worse, QB Julian Sayin even threw a pick-six while the Buckeyes had -3 rushing yards, their worst first-half total since 2004.\n\nWhile Ohio State's offense played better in the second half, it wasn't enough to defeat Miami. Now, Buckeyes fans will wonder whether Day made the wrong decision to take play-calling away from the Cotton Bowl.

Ohio State missed the College Football Playoff that year, the second time in three seasons that occurred.\n\nAfter that season, Day hired Chip Kelly to call plays, and when Kelly left for the NFL in 2025, Hartline assumed the responsibilities.\n\nMORE: Revisiting 2003 Miami vs. Ohio State BCS championship game\n\nHartline agreed to be the next head coach at South Florida, and was officially introduced during the first week of December. However, Hartline is remaining on Ohio State's coaching staff until the Buckeyes season is over.\n\nWith Hartline juggling responsibilities for both South Florida and Ohio State, Ryan Day felt it was important to take some pressure off him. While Ohio State competes for a national title, Hartline is trying to build his team at USF.",

    "fullText": "A reflective, grateful and emotional Gary Danielson asked a rhetorical question after sharing his Sun Bowl sign-off message with his expansive CBS team, \"How are we going to get off the air?\"\n\nThe answer to the question came less than 10 seconds later.\n\nAs the analyst was searching for the final words of his final college football broadcast to punctuate a 36-year run calling ball, CBS cut him off.\n\nCBS cut off Gary Danielson as he was still delivering his sign-off message into retirement. https://t.co/pMsRFHRQxS pic.twitter.com/7qHTCKhIz1\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) December 31, 2025\n\nIn the corner of the frame, a hand can be seen counting down the final seconds of the farewell to the former Purdue, Detroit Lions and Cleveland Browns quarterback.\n\nThat's when Danielson appeared to call an audible.\n\n\"Sometimes you can say, how do you get off? Danielson said before pointing to his producer and adding, \"This guy right here.\"\n\nAbruptly, CBS went to commercial break, wrapping the broadcast. Hard outs are part of live TV, and Danielson of course knows that, but that ad interruption brought an untimely end to an otherwise beautiful tribute to one of the greatest voices in college football history.\n\nMinutes earlier, Danielson — flanked by play-by-play announcer Brad Nessler and sideline reporter Jenny Dell — heard about and watched back some of the great moments during his illustrious career in the booth.\n\n\"To have done it with somebody that is unmatched in what you do has been a privilege,\" Nessler said. \"It's been an honor. I'm going to miss you. Our team's going to miss you. Our crew's going to miss you. CBS is going to miss you.\n\n\"And damn it, college football's going to miss you, buddy.\"\n\nDanielson has been part of CBS' top college football broadcasting pair since 2006 and is a six-time Emmy nominee.\n\nA mainstay in the afternoon slot, he became a staple in SEC coverage and lately had expanded his footprint to the Big Ten with CBS.\n\n\"Everybody says, what do you want to be remembered as? That's cool, but it's what I want to remember. And this is the stuff I remember,\" Danielson says as a slideshow of pictures rolled, documenting his time with his coworkers at CBS.\n\nThose weren't his final words on air. But maybe they should be the ones we remember.",

    "description": "Miami and Ohio State collide for a spot in the CFP semis. Which players on both teams could be Seahawks draft targets?",
    "fullText": "As the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks prepare for the game of the year, the College Football Playoff is hitting its stride. The quarterfinals are underway, and we have a massive one tonight between Ohio State and Miami.\n\nThe Buckeyes are the defending champs, while the Hurricanes are trying to bring back the 80’s as we head into the new year. There are some massive prospects, literally and figuratively, that the Seahawks will likely be watching tonight, from a scouting perspective.\n\nDon’t be surprised if a few Seattle scouts are in Dallas tonight for this massive game at the Cotton Bowl.\n\nFrancis Mauigoa, OL, Miami – the former five-star recruit was one of the first major additions to what Mario Cristobal’s run in rebuilding the Hurricanes program.\n\nThe 6-6, 315 lbs left tackle has been a steady staple for a Miami team that is about to take on its most toughest test of the season. Against Notre Dame and Texas A&M this season, Mauigoa was good, not great.\n\nI think he’s got a chance to go in the top ten, but I also think he’s better suited as a guard, and so there is potential for a slide. He’s a guy that maybe worth trading up for.\n\nAkheem Mesidor, Edge, Miami – While Reuben Bain Jr. gets all the hype, his edge rushing partner has shown to be just as dominant in 2025.\n\nMesidor, a six year college veteran, is having his best year yet for the Hurricanes. On the year, Mesidor has 51 total tackles with 13.5 tackles for a loss, including 8.5 sacks. His age is a factor, he’ll be 25 when he plays his first NFL game, so he’s probably a one contract type of player, but he’s an interesting day three option.\n\nSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State – Probably one of the safest picks at the linebacker position in this upcoming draft. Arvell Reese gets all the hype, and rightfully so, but Styles is as solid and safe of a pick, while being a stud championship caliber player.\n\nOn this Seahawks defense, it’s hard not to look at the linebacker spot as an area where John Schneider and Mike Macdonald want to improve. Ernest Jones is a good player, but he could use some help and depth at the position, especially someone as athletic as Styles.\n\nStyles may not feel like the most splashy first round draft pick, but he could be an immediate positive addition to this already great defense.\n\nKayden McDonald, DT, Ohio State – People will push against Seattle going defensive tackle so early in the draft, but I think it’s fair to wonder if going dline makes the most sense. Leonard Williams, Tank Lawrence, and Uchenna Nwosu have all been fantastic. They are also all on the backside of their careers, and it’s fair to wonder if this season is the peak of their powers.\n\nMcDonald may be the best defensive tackle in this class and another guy that is worth trading up for. The All-American has 57 combined tackles this year, eight tackles for a loss and 3 sacks from the nose tackle position. You simply do not run on him.\n\nMcDonald can be the perfect succession plan for the Seahawks with Leonard Williams. McDonald allows Williams to cut back on his snaps, staying healthy and explosive through the end of his contract. Leonard Williams is the perfect mentor for McDonald and could allow this team to essentially add a second Bryon Murphy.",

    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg famously dropped out of college to focus on Facebook. The cofounder of Manus says he took the same path — and now they have merged.",
    "fullText": "Meta was cofounded by a college dropout — and so was its latest acquisition.\n\nJi Yichao, the cofounder and chief scientist of Manus, the AI startup snapped up by Meta, shared two pictures on X: one of his younger self behind a laptop, and another of a young Mark Zuckerberg, seemingly in the same room, also working at a laptop.\n\nBoth pictures appear to have been taken at the so-called \"Facebook House\" in Palo Alto, California, a five-bed home where Zuckerberg worked on Facebook after famously dropping out of Harvard University in 2004. The house was later rented by budding entrepreneurs and business students.\n\n\"21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge,\" Ji wrote in the Monday X post.\n\nThe 32-year-old Ji was the public face of Manus for its launch in March, introducing its \"general-purpose\" AI agent designed to carry out tasks autonomously. Meta announced its acquisition of Manus on Monday, which the Wall Street Journal reported exceeded $2 billion.\n\nAccording to reports in Chinese media, Ji started a computer science degree at the Beijing Information Science and Technology University (BISTU) in 2010, but later dropped out to focus on entrepreneurship. He returned to BISTU in 2015 and graduated in 2018, according to a blog from the university. Manus did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nZuckerberg and Ji have plenty of company. Meta's other big AI acquisition this year, Scale AI, was founded by another college dropout — Alexandr Wang. Microsoft cofounders Bill Gates and Paul Allen dropped out of college, along with Apple CEO Steve Jobs, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and many more.\n\n21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge. https://t.co/NpnNkqhuso pic.twitter.com/s6v7kDsq1y\n\nJi's post comes as college degrees are under renewed scrutiny. Gen Z in particular has been questioning whether a degree is worth the debt, while others are wondering if college can future-proof their career prospects in a job market being shaken up by AI.\n\nFei-Fei Li, a Stanford professor known as the \"Godmother of AI,\" said earlier this month that a college degree matters less now when her company hires software engineers.\n\nHowever, data published by the New York Federal Reserve in April suggested that a college degree can still pay off in the long run — provided students pick the right degree.\n\nManus was launched in March by the Chinese AI product studio Butterfly Effect. The startup relocated to Singapore in mid-2025 and said it has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue. Meta said it would continue to offer Manus' subscription as a separate business while integrating the startup's technology into its own platforms.",

    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff quarterfinals kick off with a Miami (Fla.) vs. Ohio State showdown. We've compiled everything you need to know about how to watch the Cotton Bowl, including live streaming options for those without cable.\n\nThe No. 10 Miami Hurricanes will take on the No. 2 Ohio State Buckeyes, the reigning Cotton Bowl and National Champions. Miami has had a great run this year, only dropping two games during the regular season and defeating No. 7 Texas A&M 10-3 in the first round of the playoffs. Ohio State has also offered up a worthy season, winning 12 games in a row before fumbling their last regular-season game against No. 1 Indiana. Whether they can shake off the loss and repeat last year's success remains to be seen, but we'll make sure you can tune in so you don't miss a second of the action.\n\nKeep reading to learn the best ways to live stream tonight's game. The streaming options we highlight will also allow you to watch the remainder of the College Football Playoff games, from the New Year's Day quarterfinals to the National Championship.\n\nThe Cotton Bowl will air on ESPN in the US. The Miami vs. Ohio State game is scheduled to kick off on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nIf you don't have cable, there are several avenues to explore when it comes to live streaming the Cotton Bowl. ESPN Unlimited is ESPN's direct counterpart and a must-have for cord-cutting sports fans. Subscriptions cost $30 a month and unlock all things ESPN, as well as ESPN2, the ACC Network, the SEC Network, ABC on ESPN content, ESPN Plus streaming exclusives, and much more. You can also save with a limited-time deal when you bundle ESPN Unlimited with Disney Plus and Hulu.\n\nESPN Unlimited has everything from ESPN Plus, in addition to all that the ESPN linear networks have to offer.\n\nIf you'd prefer to watch through a streaming service that carries other channels (in addition to ESPN) or offers a free trial, then a live TV streaming service will be able to do the trick. DirecTV and Fubo are two of the best live TV streaming services we've tested that also offer free trials to new customers.\n\nDirecTV MySports carries ESPN and around 20 other key networks (like TNT, the NFL Network, and local channels where applicable) in its sports-centric genre pack. The plan also unlocks access to ESPN Unlimited at no extra cost. Subscriptions cost $70 a month, but new users can get their first two months for $60 a month after a five-day free trial.\n\nDirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network.\n\nFubo Sports + News is another genre-specific plan with robust sports offerings and ESPN Unlimited access. The plan offers ESPN and around 28 other popular channels. Subscriptions cost $56 a month, but new users can get their first month for $46 after a one-day free trial.\n\nThe new Fubo Sports + News pack is only available in select areas. It combines 20+ major sports channels (including the new ESPN Unlimited) and select local networks (ABC, CBS, and FOX).\n\nCFP fans traveling away from home don't need to miss out on any of the action with the help of a VPN, or virtual private network. VPNs are handy tech tools that let people change their device's virtual location so that they operate just like they would back home. This way, viewers can keep up with all their usual websites and apps from anywhere. Since the services we've highlighted require country-specific payment methods, this option will work best for those who are simply traveling abroad at the moment and hoping to use their existing subscriptions.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start when it comes to VPNs, our go-to recommendation this year has been NordVPN. It's a top-notch option with a massive selection of servers and cybersecurity perks. Plus, it's user-friendly and comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can learn more about the app in our NordVPN review.\n\nNordVPN is one of the top VPN services in the business. It offers excellent value with a strong selection of features and a low monthly price. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs.\n\nNote: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Texas Tech Red Raiders are making their first-ever College Football Playoff debut, set to take on the Oregon Ducks in the Orange Bowl quarterfinal matchup.\n\nA big reason for Tech's success this season is how well linebacker Jacob Rodriguez has been playing. He leads the Red Raiders in tackles with 117 total stops on the year, and has helped lead Texas Tech into an elite defense this season.\n\nBut what you may not know about the veteran linebacker is that he actually only started playing defense once he got to Texas Tech in 2022, previously starting his career at Virginia as an offensive player.\n\nLet's take a look at how Rodriguez transformed his college career, moving from offense to defense.\n\nMORE:History behind Texas Tech's tortilla-throwing tradition\n\nRodriguez attended Rider High School in Wichita Falls, Texas, where he played both quarterback and free safety. Per his Texas Tech bio, he passed for 7,085 yards with 68 touchdowns, adding 3,051 yards and 38 touchdowns on the ground. His high school made two trips to the  Class 5A Division II state semifinals during his sophomore and senior seasons.\n\nPer his 247Sports recruiting page, Rodrigues also played basketball and participated in the long jump, triple jump and relays for his track and field team.\n\nMORE:Revisiting Patrick Mahomes' Texas Tech career\n\nGiven his multi-position background in high school, he was listed as an athlete by 247Sports. The outlet listed him as a 3-star, ranked as the No. 26 athlete from the class of 2021.\n\nHe received offers from a number of power-conference schools, such as Baylor, Houston, Indiana, Kansas State, Iowa State and Virginia. He committed to the Cavaliers' 2021 class in April 2020 and remained committed up through his Dec. signing. Despite other schools wanting him to play defense, UVA actually recruited Rodriguez as a quarterback.\n\n“That had a little effect on my decision,” Rodriguez said in April 2020 via the Times Record News. “Beyond playing football, I want to go into coaching. I feel like learning the quarterback position at the college level gives me a better understanding of play calls and how to learn how to do things as a whole on offense.\"\n\nBut once he got to Virginia, he was utilized at a number of positions on offense, including receiver and fullback. He appeared in all 12 games as a true freshman, getting eight receptions for 65 yards and a touchdown with another 10 carries for 56 yards on the ground.\n\nHe played behind UVA quarterback Brennan Armstrong, who broke single-season records for the Cavaliers in 2021.\n\nPer a recent ESPN feature on Rodriguez, UVA coaches told him they planned to make him into the next Taysom Hill. But his time in Charlottesville lasted just one season, as he entered the transfer portal in Dec. 2021 after UVA head coach Bronco Mendenhall abruptly resigned after six seasons as the Cavs head coach.\n\nMORE:Picks, predictions  for 2025 CFP quarterfinal games\n\nRodriguez entered the portal largely because of Mendenhall leaving.\n\n\"I loved it there and loved the people there,\" Rodriguez said via ESPN of his time at Virginia. \"But I kind of went there to play for him.\"\n\nTexas Tech head coach Joey McGuire, who had recruited Rodriguez in high school while he was at Baylor, offered Rodriguez a spot on the team as a walk-on, but was placed on scholarship before the 2022 season.\n\nPrior to him transferring to Texas Tech, the Red Raiders coaches informed him he would not be joining as a quarterback. Although it took some time, Rodriguez started figuring out the defensive side of things in 2022.\n\n\"Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play,\" Rodriguez said via NWA Online of the position change. \"I've done it on the offensive side of the ball, I've done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I've done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. \"That's kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.\"\n\nLOOK:Texas Tech's 'Too-Cold' uniforms\n\nRodriguez finished with a combined 59 total tackles during his first two seasons at linebacker. But you can see the huge numbers he's put up during his junior and senior seasons:\n\nUnsurprisingly, Rodriguez cleaned up during the college football awards season. Here's a look at each award he took home:\n\nChuck Bednarik Award (nation's top defensive player)\n\nButkus Award (nation's top linebacker)\n\nBronko Nagurski Trophy (nation's top defensive player)\n\nLombardi Award (nation's top lineman or linebacker)\n\nPony Express Award (nation's top duo with David Bailey)\n\nDespite a campaign for him to be a Heisman finalist, was not invited to New York City. Even still, the linebacker impressively finished fifth in Heisman voting, receiving 17 first-place votes.\n\nMORE:Why Michigan landed the perfect replacement for Sherrone Moore in Kyle Whittingham",

    "fullText": "ARLINGTON, Texas — The Cotton Bowl certainly has gotten much more significant for Ohio State during three trips in a row to the game.\n\nThis time, the second-seeded Buckeyes (12-1) are defending national champions as they get ready to play College Football Playoff first-timer Miami (11-2, CFP No. 10 seed) in a quarterfinal here Wednesday night. The Cotton Bowl last January was a CFP semifinal when Ohio State beat Texas for the third of four wins needed last postseason for a sixth Associated Press national title.\n\nAs for the first of those appearances in North Texas two years ago, that was the last season before the CFP expanded from four to 12 teams and when it wasn’t the Cotton Bowl’s turn as one of the playoff games. The Buckeyes arrived then coming off a regular season-ending loss to rival Michigan after a 10-0 start. Their starting quarterback (Kyle McCord) had transferred and NFL-bound All-American receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. opted out of playing in what was a 14-3 loss to Missouri.\n\n“Just more stakes than the first game I’ve ever played in here. ... Now it’s a bowl game with the playoffs on the line, so it just means more,” senior receiver Carnell Tate said Monday on the field at AT&T Stadium.\n\n“It wasn’t CFP, so I felt like the job was not accomplished. We kind of fell short of our initial goal, and then when we played here, our quarterback ended up transferring. It was a whole lot of stuff going on,” senior cornerback Davison Igbinosun said. “It was definitely a tough game. It really didn’t feel like a typical Ohio State game, and then here last year and back in the playoffs, and that was a great game.”\n\nOhio State hasn’t played since losing 13-10 to No. 1 Indiana in the Big Ten Championship Game matchup of undefeated teams on Dec. 6, and still got a first-round bye.\n\nMiami, which is 24 years removed from its last national title, made its CFP debut with a 10-3 win in the first round at No. 7 seed Texas A&M on Dec. 20. The Hurricanes made the 12-team playoff field even after not making the ACC title game and that league’s champ (five-loss Duke) not getting a bid.\n\nWhen the Hurricanes left Dallas after a 26-20 overtime loss at SMU on Nov. 1, their second loss in three games after a 5-0 start, they weren’t even sure they would make the playoff. Now they are back in Texas for their second playoff game in a row and with another five-game winning streak.\n\n“That was a low point for us in the season, and in that locker room, it was as simple as a decision has to be made,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “It came down to the simplicity of taking all the clips of us in our first five games and putting it on a reel and just letting it play. No audio, no one’s talking, no nothing. Just shut the lights, remind ourselves of who we are. And there’s nothing more powerful than the power of choice.”\n\nHeisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin with Ohio State and Miami’s Carson Beck have both been part of national championship teams. Now the two most accurate Football Bowl Subdivision passers are trying to win a title as a starting quarterback.\n\nSayin was the Buckeyes’ backup last year behind Will Howard. Beck transferred to Miami after being at Georgia from 2020-24, when he was a youngster on the Bulldogs’ back-to-back national championship teams in 2021 and 2022 — he did get some late snaps in that second title game, a 65-7 romp over TCU.\n\nThe Cotton Bowl will be the first CFP game for Sayin, the sophomore who has thrown for 3,323 yards with 31 TDs and six interceptions. He has completed 78.4% of his passes (279 of 356). Beck made his first CFP start going 14-of-20 for 103 yards and a touchdown on a windy day in College Station. He has completed 74.5% of his passes (277 of 372) for 3,175 yards, 26 TDs and 10 interceptions.\n\nMiami’s last shot at back-to-back national championships ended in a double-overtime loss to Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3, 2003, before most of the current players were born and the only other time these teams have met in a bowl game.\n\nOhio State, which won the first CFP national championship at AT&T Stadium at the end of the 2014 season, is now trying to win consecutive national titles for the first time. The Buckeyes are in their seventh CFP overall, and are the only team to appear in five of the last seven — all of those since Ryan Day became their head coach.\n\nThe only other time the Hurricanes played in the Cotton Bowl was at the end of the 1990 season, their last as an independent before moving to the Big East. They beat Texas 46-3 in Cotton Bowl Stadium.\n\nNO. 10 MIAMI VS. NO. 2 OHIO STATE\n\nCotton Bowl, 7:30 Wednesday, Arlington, Texas\n\nTV: ESPN Line/OU: Ohio State by 9 ½; 40 ½",

    "fullText": "ARLINGTON, Texas — Caleb Downs had to be reminded that he was getting ready for his sixth College Football Playoff game, which probably won’t be rare a decade from now but is unique in just the second year of the expanded 12-team format.\n\nThe Ohio State safety smiled at the thought and figured it couldn’t hurt to have played in the CFP as a freshman at Alabama, losing 27-20 to Michigan in overtime before transferring to the Wolverines’ biggest rival and winning four postseason games and a national championship with the Buckeyes a year ago.\n\n“That could be a positive, just knowing that I’ve been in this situation so many times,” said Downs, a two-time Associated Press All-American. “At the end of the day, it’s not about me. It’s about everybody else feeling confident during the game. Really just trying to push that to all my teammates.”\n\nHe’s talking younger teammates such as freshman Devin Sanchez, a backup cornerback who has tried to imagine the nerves and emotions in the hours before kickoff in a Cotton Bowl quarterfinal against No. 10 Miami.\n\nThe Hurricanes (11-2, CFP No. 10 seed) are first-time CFP qualifiers, but got a start on those nerves with the 10-3 first-round victory at Texas A&M on Dec. 20.\n\nThe third-ranked Buckeyes (12-1, CFP No. 2) got a first-round bye despite losing to top-ranked Indiana in the Big Ten championship game.\n\n“Lean on them a lot, more than you think,” Sanchez said. “They’re guys that have been here a lot of times, a couple of guys have been to the Cotton Bowl for the third straight year in a row. So this is not a new place for them. As a new guy, there’s nothing I can do but lean on them. The speed will be a little different. The intensity will be up a little bit more. Just lean on those guys, and when my number’s called just be able to go out there and make sure that they trust me to be out there.”\n\nDowns remembers the nerves from his CFP debut with the Crimson Tide. He was in the Rose Bowl, a spectacle he had seen on TV as a kid.\n\n“That was probably the biggest game I had played at the time,” said Downs, one of the top players in the 2024 portal as the first freshman to lead the storied Alabama program in tackles. “Knowing that, it was a little bit of nerves.”\n\nThe Buckeyes were in the Cotton Bowl for last season’s semifinals, beating Texas 28-14 after comfortable wins over Tennessee at home and No. 1 Oregon in a Rose Bowl quarterfinal.\n\nDowns found a way to leave the Rose Bowl with a better feeling. Now he’ll be back on the field where he intercepted Texas’ Quinn Ewers almost a year ago, in what will be his 44th game in just three seasons.\n\n“I think just in general with Caleb, just the amount of experience he has playing football is probably the most important thing,” first-year defensive coordinator Matt Patricia said. “His professionalism and how he prepares is probably the best example that I can point to for all the players.”\n\nDowns, a projected first-round pick should he decide to enter the NFL draft in April, isn’t the only experienced defensive back. Davison Igbinosun and Jermaine Matthews Jr., the starting cornerbacks in front of Sanchez, have been around awhile.\n\nIgbinosun was on the 2023 Ohio State team that also played in the Cotton Bowl, a 14-3 loss to Missouri after missing out on the last four-team playoff.\n\nA year later, Downs was with him, believing the experience of being in the playoff didn’t matter as much as losing in the playoff.\n\n“It definitely added a little bit of fuel to the fire because I lost my freshman year,” Downs said. “It made me want to come back and play better. I think that was a lot of what everybody else on the team felt because they didn’t have the success they wanted to earlier in their career. I think that was a hungry team. And we’ve got to be the same way this year.”",

    "description": "All hail the god of college football: The Transfer Portal.",
    "fullText": "I was really trying to wait on this. But you know. That’s how football goes.\n\nThe transfer portal doesn’t open for another 2 weeks – unless you’re reading this in the future, in which case, hi, I hope things are getting better! – and yet it’s all anyone seems to be talking about these days (especially over on Rock M+‘s football forums!) Players are moving left and right, Eli Drinkwitz is publicly pleading for certain players to come back… it’s a real mess. But it’s our mess.\n\nSo for the foreseeable future (aka one month from when I’m writing this), we’re going to use this post as a home base for transfer portal activity. We’ve put together a handy little table showing you all the players we think Mizzou is/should be targeting (the ‘Targets’ tab) and another showing which Mizzou players are moving out and going else where (the ‘Outgoing Activity’ tab.)\n\nWe hope this helps you organize yourselves. We’ll post much more about player movement over at Rock M+, but we’ll keep you updated with major news and updates here.\n\nWith New Years, and the transfer portal, right around the corner, Mizzou fans are so close to seeing what direction Drinkwitz takes the team in 2026. Here are a couple transfer portal updates from the past few days.\n\nNot quite Mizzou related, unless the extremely unlikely happens, but it is big SEC news that Auburn receiver Cam Coleman has declared his intentions to enter the portal. Coleman jumps to the top-rated portal player on all major recruiting outlets. Whoever lands the former Auburn receiver will have an instant-impact monster on their team for next year.\n\nPower Mizzou reported that Old Dominion receiver Ja’Cory Thomas has shown interest in Mizzou and will likely plan a visit soon. Thomas spent one year at ODU and was at Hutchinson CC prior. He was teammates with Mizzou commit Demarcus Johnson in 2024 when Hutchinson went 10-1 and won a JUCO National Championship.\n\n– 1 year of eligibility remaining\n– 41 catches, 719 yards, 5 touchdowns, 17.5 avg in 2025\n– 74.8 overall grade from PFF in 668 total snaps\n– Decent run blocker (71.4 PFF grade)\n\nMerry Christmas! Wanted to give a recap of a couple interesting things that have happened over the last few days in regards to Mizzou recruiting.\n\nFirst, the team lost Brad Larrondo, who has served as a key asset to Mizzou’s NIL deals. Larrondo helps Mizzou athletes earn deals and make money specifically in football and men’s basketball. Although he isn’t directly a part of Mizzou’s staff, this is a major blow with how big NIL has become. That being said, Drinkwitz ensured fans that there isn’t anything to worry about.\n\nGood luck to Brad and thankful for all he did, but MIZZOU NIL was started way before Brad, and is a STRONG POSITION! Carry on! #NewWay#TheMizzouWay https://t.co/ghsL5IcPIo\n\n— Eliah Drinkwitz (@CoachDrinkwitz) December 24, 2025\n\nOn another note, Mizzou RB Jamal Roberts sent a tweet out in regards to his former teammate Chase Hendricks entering the portal. Hendricks also played at St. Mary’s High School with Mizzou WR Kevin Coleman, who just used up his final year of eligibility.\n\n— Jamal Roberts (@0fficialmal20) December 24, 2025\n\nWith Marquise Davis and Joshua Manning expected to hit the portal, Mizzou will definitely be shopping in the portal for a wide receiver and Hendricks could definitely be one of the guys.\n\nWell, we need to get started somewhere. And where we’re starting feels… kind of bad?\n\nMizzou has already (publicly) lost five players to the portal, and they’re almost all in positions of need. Brendon Haygood and Marquise Davis’s departures have left Eli Drinkwitz publicly begging for Jamal Roberts to come back to the squad and take less money than he could earn on the open market. Assuming he does (think positive, think positive), Mizzou will probably be OK on running back talent, though it wouldn’t be a surprise to see Drink scoop someone up.\n\nThe wide receiver room, on the other hand, is turning into a bit of a shit show. Josh Manning’s departure is a massive disappointment to those of us who were ready to see him and Donovan Olugbode take the SEC by storm next year, and James Madison II’s early transfer saw another promising freshman talent quickly take the nearest exit. Javion Hilson’s departure is disappointing given his five-star recruiting status, but it’s also not too shocking that a surprise commitment from last year’s class didn’t stick for long.\n\nWe’ve also already got some lobbying from “rostered” players, with signee Jayden McGregory calling on his former teammate, Iowa State’s Zay Robinson, to join him in Columbia.\n\nCmon mud🤞🏾🐯 let’s run it back @XzavionRobinso4 pic.twitter.com/7JFaTQNowz\n\n— 4⭐️Jayden “JMAC” McGregory (@Jay_McGregory) December 9, 2025",

    "fullText": "Stop me if you’ve heard this before…\n\nTwo blue-blood college football programs with a rich history of national championships are set to square off, but the past few years have been much kinder to one team than the other.\n\nOne team is the defending national champion, the previous year having ended its relatively brief national title drought by thoroughly dominating a fellow, one-loss blue blood program in the championship game. This program last won a national title a decade prior, so the gap between titles had become uncomfortably long for this program’s fanbase. Of course, the previous year’s title game wasn’t nearly as close as the final score suggests. The now-defending champs raced out to a multi-touchdown lead by halftime, and lead 20+ points in the third quarter.\n\nAlthough the defending champs lost quite a bit of a talent to the NFL, including multiple first round draft picks in the previous year’s draft, this team is still stacked with future-NFL talent up and the down the roster. This team’s star safety and stable of future-pro wide receivers are particularly problematic for their opponents. The quarterback is also a Heisman finalist. Nearly every pundit in the nation believes this is the most talented team in the country, and nobody is expecting this team to lose.\n\nOn the other side of the field is the underdog. A talented team in its own right that is coming out of a long rebuild – the previous three years saw this team go a combined 21-15. But signs of progress are there. At the helm is a former offensive assistant who returned to helm this program 16 years later after building his head coaching experience. This team’s relatively new coach is a particularly strong recruiter, and this program is coming off multiple Top 10 ranked recruiting classes. Signs of emergence really started to show once this program was able to consistently beat its rivals, even though those wins did not necessarily translate to conference or national titles.\n\nThis season, the underdog built its reputation on defense. No team managed to score in the 30’s, including its premier non-conference opponent – a top 10 team that itself had national title aspirations, but finished its season with two losses and on the outside looking in. In fact, the offense looked so anemic at times that this team won a road game despite scoring just 10 points. So defense is definitely this team’s calling card, but the offense’s best weapon is a freshman stud who was the conference’s freshman of the year.\n\nThe “underdog” is both 2025 Miami and 2002 Ohio State:\n\nOhio State was a combined 21-15 from 1999 to 2001. Miami was a nearly identical 22-16 from 2022-2024.\n\nDespite the mediocre record, Ohio State was coming off back-to-back wins over arch-rival Michigan in 2001 and 2002. Despite the mediocre record, Miami was coming off back-to-back wins over arch-rival Florida State in 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe premiere non-conference win for 2002 Ohio State was 25-7 at home against Washington St., which finished the regular season with two losses and ranked No. 10 in the AP Poll. The premiere non-conference win for 2025 Miami was 27-24 at home against Notre Dame, which finished the regular season with two losses and ranked No. 9 in the AP Poll.\n\nHead Coach Jim Tressell was an assistant offensive coach for Ohio State from 1983 to 1985 before returning to Ohio State 16 years later in 2001. Head Coach Mario Cristobal was an assistant offensive coach for Miami from 2004 to 2006 before returning to Miami 16 years later in 2022.\n\nAccording to 247Sports, the Buckeyes had top ten recruiting classes in 2000 and 2001 (No. 6 and 9). The Hurricanes had top ten recruiting classes in 2023 and 2024 (No. 7 and 4).\n\nThe 2002 Ohio State Buckeyes typically held teams to under 20 points, never allowing a team to score 30, which was necessary considering how anemic their offense was at times. The 2025 Miami Hurricanes typically held teams under 20 points, never allowing a team to score 30, which was necessary considering how anemic their offense was at times.\n\n2002 Ohio State’s best offensive weapon was true freshman RB Maurice Clarett, that season’s Big Ten Freshman of the Year. 2025 Miami’s best offensive weapon is true freshman WR Malachi Toney, this season’s ACC Freshman of the Year.\n\nThe “defending champion” is both 2002 Miami and 2025 Ohio State:\n\nOhio State won the 2024 national title, beating blue-blood Notre Dame in a game that was 31-7 in the 3rd Quarter. Miami won the 2001 national title, beating blue-blood Nebraska in a game that was 34-0 at halftime.\n\nOhio State last won a national title a decade prior in 2014. Miami last won a national title a decade prior in 1991.\n\nFollowing their 2024 title run, in the 2025 NFL Draft the Buckeyes had 4 first round selections (WR Emeka Egbuka, G Donovan Jackson, DT Tyliek Williams, and DT Josh Simmons) plus another 3 second round selections (RB Quinshon Judkins, RB TreVeyon Henderson, and DE JT Tuimoloau). In the 2002 NFL Draft, the Hurricanes had 5 first round selections (OT Bryan McKinnie, TE Jeremy Shockey, CB Philip Buchanon, FS Ed Reed, and CB Mike Rumph) plus another second round selection (RB Clinton Portis).\n\nThe 2025 Ohio State Buckeyes are led by Heisman Finalist, QB Julian Sayin. The 2002 Miami Hurricanes were led by Heisman Finalist, QB Ken Dorsey.\n\nArguably 2025 Ohio State’s best offensive weapons were receivers for their Heisman Finalist quarterback, namely WRs Jeremiah Smith, Carnell Tate, and Brandon Inniss. Arguably 2002 Miami’s best offensive weapons were receivers for their Heisman Finalist quarterback, namely WRs Andre Johnson and Roscoe Parrish plus TE Kellen Winslow, Jr.\n\nArguably 2025 Ohio State’s defensive leaders are S Caleb Downs and LB Arvell Reese. Arguably 2002 Miami’s defensive leaders were S Sean Taylor and LB Jonathan Vilma.\n\nIt’s like looking into a mirror a quarter-of-a-century apart. For ‘Canes fans, hopefully history repeats itself.",

    "description": "Three AI engineers explain how returning to school, internships, and college relationships led to jobs at startups and major tech companies.",
    "fullText": "AI has become one of the most popular fields in tech. The people working in it didn't all follow the same path to get there, but for some, college played a crucial role in their success.\n\nFor one AI startup engineer, returning to school provided an opportunity to explore what an AI career would be like before committing to it. For another, moving to the US for a graduate program opened doors to being closer to the center of the action in Big Tech. In another case, relationships formed during college — with peers, professors, and mentors — continued to shape his career even long after graduation.\n\nBelow are three people who pivoted into AI roles and shared with Business Insider how they leveraged their college experience to break into the field. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nVarun Goyal is a 25-year-old AI startup engineer, based in California.\n\nIn my final year of undergraduate studies, I stood at a crossroads between quantitative trading and pursuing a career in technology. Blinded by the initial high salary and prestige, I joined a firm in India as a quantitative strategist for the summer.\n\nI enjoyed it, but I wanted to push boundaries in my career and was increasingly convinced that I should return to school to explore more options. I decided to move from India to the US for my master's degree in computer science.\n\nReturning to school gave me the opportunity to pursue research and engage with senior industry professionals in both fields. This was the biggest benefit for me when I was deciding what I wanted my daily life and career to look like in 10 years.\n\nIn graduate school, the AI boom was also happening. It kept me up at night in the best way possible. I ultimately applied to both industries and had a few quant interviews, but I decided to join an AI startup in 2024 after graduating. I took a lower base salary than what I would have earned in quant, but I felt AI gave me more options down the line.\n\nWithout going back for my master's, I wouldn't have had this opportunity, and I love working in AI.\n\nDeep Shah is a 30-year-old software engineer at Google, based in Mountain View, CA.\n\nGrowing up, I wanted to develop my own computer games, which was the primary reason I chose to pursue a career in computer engineering. I also learned through conversations with peers older than me that the field involved a lot of automating machines to work on my behalf, which excited me. This was my first experience with mentorship.\n\nWhen I was pursuing my bachelor's degree, I got involved with professors who believed in and supported me. Having someone expose me to machine learning or AI problems they're excited about, no matter how small or large, taught me skills that are rarely learned just by doing the core work.\n\nEach mentor will teach you different things, and the person doesn't necessarily need to be a professor. They could be an alum or someone who's more senior at your college. Working with a mentor is also a valuable addition to your résumé, demonstrating that you already possess the skills and experience necessary to succeed in a professional environment.\n\nLater in my career, leaning on peers and mentors provided me with opportunities to further advance my career at Google. I joined Google Bangalore in 2018 after speaking with a friend who worked there. He helped me decide the role I was applying for could be the right fit for me.\n\nIn 2021, I was still at Google Bangalore and wanted to contribute to improving the user experience on Google search. The team working on that project was based in Mountain View, CA, and my skill set was a very good match, so I decided to relocate to the US to join that team.\n\nBuilding my networking skills with peers and mentors throughout my education directly contributed to my later success at Google.\n\nKriti Goyal is a 28-year-old AI machine learning engineer at a Big Tech company, based in Seattle.\n\nI always thought I would study medicine until my cousin showed me a Code.org video with Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and other tech rockstars, about how coding is the quickest way to convert an idea into a product. That changed my life.\n\nI'm now part of the Foundation Model main framework team for a major Big Tech company in the US. This year, I completed five years with them, during which time I've held four different roles. I used my master's to move to the US and further my career.\n\nI originally interned at my current company in India. I enjoyed working in India, but the core business decisions and strategizing for the next projects were made at the company headquarters here in the US.\n\nI had two ways to go about moving to the US. One was to try to move within my company or pursue a master's degree. Two reasons I chose the master's path are the knowledge and extra specialty you can develop through projects, as well as the connections you make. The biggest thing I took away from my program was the people I met.\n\nWhen I arrived in the US, I knew a few people from my former company from my time in India, so I reached out to them directly instead of applying through the job board. I got the interview for a machine learning engineering internship quite easily because the company was already familiar with my work.\n\nLearning and networking can be done in many places; it doesn't have to be university. In a city like San Francisco or New York, you could hustle and get the networking benefits of a university and a structured system.\n\nI think it's now possible to skip that education stage. But I have seen a bias in hiring for specific teams, and it's not unbreakable yet. I was changing countries and cultures, and university was a great way to get through the immigration system and understand the culture. I needed it, and I feel fortunate to be where I am in my career because I made the decision to pursue my master's degree.\n\nDo you have a story to share about breaking into the AI field?

    "description": "The tech billionaire said there would be “a lot of cool stuff” for 20-year-olds to build now.",
    "fullText": "Nino Paoli is a former Dow Jones News Fund news fellow at Fortune.\n\nSam Altman, one of the most powerful leaders in Silicon Valley, is jealous of Gen Z college dropouts.\n\n“I’m envious of the current generation of 20-year-old dropouts,” the OpenAI CEO told Rowan Cheung during an interview at the DevDay conference. “Because the amount of stuff you can build… the opportunity space is so incredibly wide.”\n\nAltman said in the past couple of years he has not had a “real chunk of free mental space” to think about what he’d build now. “But I know that there would be a lot of cool stuff to build,” he said.\n\nAltman dropped out of Stanford University in 2005 after two years of studying computer science. An “unexpected opportunity arose” for 19-year-old Altman, who left Stanford to cofound the location-sharing app Loopt.\n\nAs CEO of the company, Altman helped bring in more than $30 million in funding including from notable VC firms like Sequoia Capital. Loopt went through startup accelerator Y Combinator, and after the app was acquired, he became the president of YC. He later cofounded OpenAI in December 2015 with a slew of people, including the world’s richest man, Elon Musk.\n\nDespite his rise to success with tech startups, Altman said he longs to brainstorm other businesses.\n\n“The degree to which OpenAI is, like, taking over all of my mental space, and I don’t get to go think about how to build a new startup, is a little bit sad,” Altman said.\n\nAltman joins a list of college dropouts that have become tech leaders in Silicon Valley, including Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe tech billionaire also said in August he’s envious of young people because current early-career jobs will look “boring” by comparison to jobs in 10 years’ time.\n\nAs Gen Z is in the midst of a job crisis, higher education is being scrutinized even more as the right path for tech entrepreneurs and startup hopefuls.\n\nIn September, GV CEO David Krane—and employee No. 84 at Google—said his son spent the entire summer break between college semesters working in AI, and was questioning if higher education was a “scam.”\n\nOnly 41% of junior U.S. professionals say a college degree is necessary for career success, according to a new LinkedIn Workforce Confidence survey. And CEOs of big tech companies are echoing similar sentiments.\n\n“There’s going to have to be a reckoning,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Theo Von in a “This Past Weekend” episode in April. “Maybe not everyone needs to go to college,” because there are a lot of jobs that don’t require it, he added.\n\n“People are probably coming around to that opinion a little more now than maybe, like, 10 years ago,” Zuckerberg said.\n\nA version of this story published on Fortune.com on October 8, 2025.",

    "fullText": "The demolition of Hawai’i’s Aloha Stadium is finally underway after several delays.\n\nOnce home to the NFL Pro Bowl, college football’s Hawaiʻi Bowl and University of Hawaiʻi football, Aloha Stadium is transitioning into a new scaled-down stadium with an accompanying entertainment district.\n\nAs part of the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District (NASED) project, the new stadium is set for a projected grand opening in March 2029, and is expected to have a seating capacity of 22,500, less than half of the previous 50,000 seats it held.\n\n“The demolition/dismantling of Aloha Stadium has begun,” Aloha Stadium Authority chairman Eric Fujimoto said at the NASED monthly meeting on Dec. 18. The removal of furnishings and the subsequent dismantling of the facility are expected to take approximately 10 months.\n\nThe beginning of the demolition process marks a major milestone for a plan that has been repeatedly delayed. The reopening of the stadium was initially scheduled to be on time for the Rainbow Warriors’ football season in 2028, but was pushed back to 2029 in August of this year.\n\nBefore its final closing after years of maintenance issues, Aloha Stadium was an innovative steel-constructed venue with movable seating sections for different sports and events.\n\nHowever, the stadium, also known as the Metal Mecca, met its downfall because of that very design structure.\n\nThe steel structure was not a good match for Hawai’i’s humid climate, which led to severe, damaging rust that required frequent repairs.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the stadium with a costly history was put to rest.\n\nWith the demolition now in full swing, attention turns to the broader vision of the NASED project. The construction of the new, smaller stadium and the surrounding entertainment district is expected to cost the state $350 million.\n\nThe new Aloha Stadium’s entertainment district is expected to include 4,000 to 4,500 housing units, multiple hotels, retail and dining spaces and cultural attractions. Residential construction is projected to take place shortly after the opening of the newly renovated Aloha Stadium, as early as 2029 or 2030.\n\nDiego Rivera - The Sporting Tribune\n\nThe University of Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors celebrate linebacker Jalen Smith's (3) fumble recovery during an NCAA football game against the Utah State Aggies, Saturday, October 11, 2025.\n\nAfter playing its home games at the Clarence T.C. Ching Athletics Complex since the closing of Aloha Stadium, University of Hawai’i football is set to move back into the new facility in 2029 under a license agreement negotiated with Hawai’i Athletics Director Matt Elliott.\n\n“While there is still much work ahead, the progress being made gives all of us reason to be optimistic,” Elliott said in a September press release. “We are excited to see momentum building and remain committed to doing our part to bring this long-awaited vision to life.”\n\nAs demolition progresses and construction plans take shape, the NASED project ushers in a new era for Hawai’i sports.",

    "title": "Letters to Sports: Playing the blame game in USC-Notre Dame debacle",
    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section share their thoughts on the USC-Notre Dame rivalry, the Rams, UCLA, Angels and college football.",
    "fullText": "Bill Plaschke writes, “If the Trojans truly want to return to greatness, being selected for the CFP is the goal. Not beating Notre Dame. Not even beating UCLA.” That's 100% wrong.\n\nAs a USC alum (1965) and longtime fan, those are the only things that do matter. I have often said that if USC beats UCLA or Notre Dame, the coach deserves another season. To give up this grand tradition in pursuit of the arguably artificial and profit-driven CFP would be an unforgivable sin.\n\nA USC national football championship without playing Notre Dame rings hollow — an asterisked title, a meal that never satisfies, a taste you can’t quite wash away. It may shine in the record books, but it will always feel unfinished to those who know what real college football tradition demands. Earth to Lincoln Riley: an undefeated season is still a loss without playing the Fighting Irish. What’s next? If UCLA becomes competitive, then there will be no crosstown game?\n\nSo the Fighting Irish own a series edge of 53-37, have won 3 in a row, 7 of the last 8, and 11 of the last 15 games. Yet Bill Plaschke now claims that Notre Dame is running away from the series and is afraid of \"Ole SC.\" To paraphrase the late, great Jim Healy, Plaschke is on the Leonard Tose highway!\n\nNotre Dame is the Burger King of college football — always having it their way. From backdoor deals with the corrupt [CFP] guaranteeing a playoff spot if they finish ranked in the top 12 to refusing to join a conference so that they can pocket all bowl game money, the Irish are treated like college football royalty. Glad USC told the Irish toddlers they can’t have ice cream for breakfast!\n\n“USC and Notre Dame recognize how special our rivalry is to our fans …\" A joint statement by the athletic directors of the two schools. Really? Fake news!\n\nNo USC-Notre Dame football game! Who’s next to be cut from the Notre Dame football schedule, Navy? Oh wait, the Irish can’t afford to drop Navy. That might hurt their chance$ at a playoff berth.\n\nI don't think firing the Rams' special teams coach is the answer. How about running some tackling drills with the defensive backs during the week. I know there's \"no crying in baseball,\" but is it now \"there's no tackling in football?\" Throw in some deep coverage drills too!\n\nSo it looks like athletic director Martin Jarmond has forced UCLA followers to accept his decisions made outside of public scrutiny once again with a contract extension for Mick Cronin. If you haven’t noticed, UCLA basketball has been sliding into mediocrity. Seats at home games are increasingly vacant. USC is outrecruiting UCLA. Prices for seats would make you think you are going to see a top-tier team. UCLA has been sitting on distant memories. How long will it take to fully trash those memories? Jarmond’s easy-way-out decision is dooming the basketball program.\n\nHaving been a Kings fan since Luc Robitaille's rookie year, I have seen some very good Kings teams and some very bad ones. But never have I seen a team with so much potential and skill be so absolutely lethargic and unwatchable this season. This team currently ranks 31st out of 32 teams in overall scoring and power-play percentage. How bad is it? As of Christmas Eve, in the last 5 games the team has a total of 8 goals and 8 assists, or 16 points, the sum total of all 18 skaters on the ice over 5 games. Connor McDavid, the leading NHL scorer, has racked up 15 points in his last 5 games … just one skater. The saying goes that the fish rots from the head. Time to show coach Jim Hiller and his entire staff the door. A fresh start, a new motivator. Is Darryl Sutter available again?\n\nRonald J Peters\nColorado Springs, Colo.\n\nIn his Dec. 22 analysis, Bill Shaikin implies that payroll is the difference between winning and losing baseball teams. For the Angels, the on-field problems are rooted in off-the-field issues that have gone largely unchecked for at least a decade. As Angel fans, we can only hope that the settling of the Tyler Skaggs lawsuit, a low 2026 payroll, and one-year contracts to the GM and manager indicate that Arte Moreno is readying the Angels for sale. New ownership and upper management are what’s needed, not a higher payroll.\n\nIt was fitting that rapper 50 Cent performed live during Oklahoma’s first-round College Football Playoff loss, since the Sooners basically showed up for only two quarters.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

    "description": "As we close out 2025, why not look back at an excellent year of college and amateur golf.",
    "fullText": "Another year of college and amateur golf is in the books.\n\nAs the year winds down, it's time to look back at some of the best moments throughout the year in the college and amateur game. Whether it was teenagers breaking out on a national stage or established players making history in their own journey, it was an exciting year for fans who follow golf up-and-coming stars.\n\nLet's take a look back at some of the biggest stories of the year, starting with perhaps the biggest breakout of them all.\n\nFirst, Howell won medalist honors at a U.S. Open qualifier to earn his first major championship start. Then he won medalist honors at the U.S. Junior Amateur. That wasn't enough. He got into the U.S. Amateur match-play bracket via a playoff and proceeded to win the biggest amateur championship in the world and represented the U.S. on the Walker Cup team, going 2-1. Mason Howell is here.\n\nAs time goes on, we'll be able to look at this result and truly measure its significance in the sport, but Northwestern knocking off No. 1 Stanford in the championship match at the NCAA Women's Golf Championship is arguably the biggest upset in women's college golf history. Anything can happen in match play, and Northwestern pulled off the miraculous win for its first championship in school history.\n\nIt's hard to describe what an incredible week it was at the Walker Cup. Cypress Point is one of the cathedrals of golf in the entire world, ranked No.1 on Golfweek's Best list of Classic Courses in the U.S., and it was a perfect venue for many of the best amateurs in the U.S. and Great Britain & Ireland to battle it out. The crowds were spectacular, sights breathtaking and Cypress Point got to show off in primetime. Hard to find how it wasn't an unforgetable week for players and fans alike.\n\nFrom one Pacific coast beauty to another, Bandon Dunes was spectacular theater for the 2025 U.S. Women's Amateur, but perhaps it's fitting that Megha Ganne found a way to come out on top. She's long been a star in the game of golf, but her triumph at Bandon Dunes was her crowning achievement on one of the biggest stages in golf. She was spectacular all week in Oregon and got to hoist the trophy after a dominant week.\n\nLuke Clanton was a professional for more than half the year, but the first five months of 2025 belonged to Clanton in the amateur game. The former No. 1 earned his PGA Tour card thanks to his play in those events, and he also dominated at the collegiate level, winning the Ben Hogan Award and nearly claiming the Fred Haskins, too. Now, it seems he's due for his first PGA Tour win in 2026.\n\nFrom one former Florida State No. 1 amateur to another, Woad was a constant presence near the top of leaderboards all year. So much so, that she won the Women's Irish Open as an amateur and then finished third at the Amundi Evian Championship, locking up her LPGA card and turning pro the next week. And then guess what? She went and won the women's Scottish Open. She won the 2024 Augusta National Women's Amateur to put her on the map, but she was destined to be a star long before.\n\nAnd how did Woad get her card? LEAP is how. The program, which is similar to PGA Tour University in that college players earn points based on finishes in top college and amateur events to provide a pathway directly to the Tour, had a stellar debut with Woad earning her card after the third-place finish at the Amundi Evian. Don't be surprised to see Kiara Romero earn her LPGA card via the same pathway in 2026.\n\nThere was a college golfer who made Division II history this fall. Drew Zielinski, a senior at Lee University, won the Golfweek Fripp Island to Bermuda Invitational, becoming the first player to win a D-II event that offered an exemption into a PGA Tour event. He later played in the Butterfield Bermuda Championship, where he finished T-15 in the field in birdies made but just missed the cut.\n\nTwo golfers at Purdue Fort Wayne jumped into an icy pond to save a man from drowning. What an incredible story of heroism.\n\nNiel Phillips had a day he will never forget in October. He aced the same hole not once, but twice in the same day. Phillips began the first round on Monday on the 182-yard hole, and he pulled a 6-iron and made it on his first shot of the day. He shot even-par 72 in the opening round before returning to the eighth hole in the afternoon for the second shotgun start of the day. This time, he hit a 7-iron. Different club, same result. His second ace in about 6 hours in the same spot where he made the first one.\n\nSeve. Jose Maria. Sergio. Jon. Carla. Carla Bernat Escuder added her name to the list of Spanish legends who have won at Augusta National, becoming the first woman from Spain to win the Augusta National Women's Amateur.\n\nIt's coming. A 59 in a college golf event is going to happen soon, possibly in the spring. It happened early this year in a practice round, with Utah's Sergio Jimenez accomplishing the feat. But how long until it happens in competition?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Looking back at the best moments from college and amateur golf in 2025",

    "description": "A three-game win streak hasn't kept Florida from dipping in the College Basketball Power Index. The Gators remain just outside the top 10.",
    "fullText": "Despite a three-game win streak going into the Christmas break, the Florida Gators continue to drop in the ESPN College Basketball Power Index.\n\nLast ranked No. 11 following a win over George Washington, Florida fell one spot to No. 12 after decisive wins over Saint Francis and Colgate — both considered Quadrant 4 matchups by the NET rankings.\n\nThe Gators have a 19.0 overall BPI, up from 18.5 on Dec. 16. The offense improved to 8.8 (20th) from 8.0 (24th), while the Florida defense dipped to 10.2 (T-10th) from 10.3 (8th) in that time. ESPN projects Florida to go 21.5-9.5 overall — a 0.5-game increase — and 12.5-5.5 in conference play, a 0.4-game improvement.\n\n“The College Basketball Power Index (BPI) is a measure of team strength that is meant to be the best predictor of performance going forward,” ESPN explains. “BPI represents how many points above or below average a team is. Strength of Record (SOR) is a measure of team accomplishment based on how difficult a team’s W-L record is to achieve. Game predictions account for opponent strength, pace of play, site, travel distance, day’s rest and altitude, and are used to simulate the season 10,000 times to produce season projections.”\n\nFlorida remains the favorite to win the SEC, with 41% odds — up from 38.2% chance last week. The Vanderbilt Commodores (29%) and Tennessee Volunteers (21.3%) have the next best odds to win the conference, followed by Alabama Crimson Tide (15%) and Kentucky (14%). No other SEC team has better than a 4.4% chance to win the conference.\n\nFlorida's remaining strength of schedule is now 24th in the country, up from 44th before a three-game stretch against Quadrant 4 opponents. Florida still has Dartmouth on the schedule, and then it's all SEC from there. The Gators' strength of schedule (to date) ranks fifth in the country, while the non-conference slate ranks sixth nationally.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida Gators basketball ESPN BPI rankings Dec. 26",

    "title": "'This s*** is crazy' — Baylor's addition of James Nnaji further blurs line between pro and college hoops",
    "description": "The combination of schools looking for players outside the traditional recruiting realm and judges eroding the NCAA’s ability to enforce eligibility rules has led everyone here, whether they like it or not.",
    "fullText": "It’s rare for a college basketball story to enter the mainstream sports conversation on Christmas Eve, but Baylor’s announcement that it had added center James Nnaji — the 31st pick in the 2023 NBA Draft – was enough of a “What are we doing here?” moment for it to break through.\n\nThough college sports is now professional in almost every sense — including players who have signed pro contracts in Europe and the NBA G League finding their way to college basketball this year — the Nnaji development feels like new territory. This isn’t someone who slipped through the cracks or got bad advice, turned pro out of high school and ran into a career dead end. Nnaji, who has been playing in Europe, was one draft slot away from being a first-round pick with a guaranteed NBA contract. He played in the NBA Summer League and has even been part of a trade.\n\n“Santa Claus is delivering mid season acquisitions…this s*** is crazy!!” UConn coach Dan Hurley wrote on X shortly after the news became public.\n\nIs this really the type of player who should be part of college basketball? Who knows, maybe Arizona can get LeBron James on the bench for its Final Four push if he wants to play with his son Bryce.\n\nThat would be absurd, of course — and, to be clear, expressly against NCAA rules since these pro-to-college cases must take place within five years of high school — but you can be forgiven if it seems like anything goes these days.\n\nAnd guess what? As more college programs pursue mid-year additions, some have even checked in with G League players on two-way contracts who have appeared in actual NBA games. That seems inevitable at some point, too, given where this trend seems to be headed.\n\nBut don’t blame Baylor or any program for pursuing those players.\n\nWhile you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in college sports who thinks this is a good development, schools are merely doing what the NCAA has given them the green light to do as it waits and hopes for some kind of antitrust protection from Congress that would allow for the actual enforcement of the rulebook rather than a mishmash of eligibility rulings.\n\nIt’s tempting to wail away on the NCAA’s ineffectiveness here, especially if you’re, say, a Kentucky fan who remembers when the NCAA denied Enes Kanter’s eligibility because he received $33,000 over his necessary living expenses from a pro team in Turkey. That seems picayune compared to what’s happening regularly now, where schools are arranging for far higher payments to European teams just to get players bought out of contracts so they can come to college.\n\nAt the same time, the NCAA is in an incredibly difficult spot. Their executives and attorneys understand that each time the line of demarcation moves, as it has here, it chips away at the NCAA’s ability to ensure college sports are played by college students, not people who bypassed that opportunity and want to suddenly turn back because NIL has become so lucrative.\n\nBut the NCAA also sees a legal environment with a deluge of eligibility cases, with some judges granting sixth and seventh years to players. Gonzaga’s Tyon Grant-Foster, who will turn 26 before the NCAA tournament, was originally denied eligibility but granted a preliminary injunction in Washington to play this season — seven years after he enrolled in junior college.\n\nNCAA officials would argue nothing major has changed from a policy standpoint; rather, what’s different is the willingness of schools to recruit and enroll those players — and, of course, the willingness of those players to come play college basketball. Before there was big NIL money involved, it just wouldn’t have been something to consider. Now, it’s often a far more lucrative path than trying to make it to the NBA from the G League.\n\nThe combination of schools looking for players outside the traditional recruiting realm and judges eroding the NCAA’s ability to enforce eligibility rules has led everyone here, whether they like it or not.\n\nSports attorney Darren Heitner theorized Friday in his “Newsletter, Image, Likeness” blog on the legal landscape in college sports that this could also be part a calculated strategy by the NCAA to present college basketball as “one option within a broader professional and semi-professional basketball market that includes the G League, international leagues and other alternatives” to make the argument that the NCAA isn’t a monopoly.\n\n“If the NCAA can establish through these eligibility decisions that college basketball and professional leagues occupy the same competitive labor market, it will fundamentally reshape the antitrust analysis in ongoing and future cases,” Heitner wrote.\n\nThe question, though, is to what end? Is the point of this enterprise now merely about legal survival while college basketball transforms into a place for guys stuck in the NBA developmental system to come and get a big payday?\n\nThat doesn’t seem right. And even if the NCAA can get some kind of protection from Congress — it’s been six years and counting since the organization started down that path, so no guarantees there — it’s hard to imagine some of this stuff just comes to a hard stop. Once the window opens this wide, it’s difficult to close.\n\nMaybe it’s time for college basketball and the NBA to sit down and figure out a different model, one that perhaps mimics hockey’s system where players can be drafted but play in college until they decide to sign with their pro team.\n\nImagine a world where nobody has to enter the NBA Draft, they’re just automatically in the pool of draft-eligible players the year they turn 18 years old. At that point, decisions about what’s best for their development would take place collectively between the NBA franchise that drafted them and their college team. Perhaps you could even construct a system where a drafted player can join the NBA or G League team on a provisional basis after the college season and then go back to college if they feel like they need another year.\n\nOf course that would require a lot of work, cooperation and collective bargaining changes on the NBA side. But it makes a lot more sense than college coaches who need another body to bypass a high school kid and instead recruit a grown man who never intended to go to college with a six-figure payday.\n\nIf they’re simply going to wait around for Congress to deliver guardrails, Nnaji is going to be the first of many former NBA Draft picks to find their way back to college basketball and make the NCAA look like it has no rules at all.",

    "description": "If Whittingham does take the Michigan job, it could have a ripple effect throughout college football in the state of Utah.",
    "fullText": "It’s been a whirlwind two weeks for the University of Utah after Kyle Whittingham stepped down as head coach.\n\nAfter stepping down at Utah, the 66-year-old Whittingham continued to keep his options open, and on Friday, ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that Whittingham and Michigan are progressing toward a deal to make the longtime Ute Michigan’s new head coach.\n\nWhittingham’s deal with Michigan is expected to be finalized today, Thamel reported.\n\nIf Whittingham does take the Michigan job, it could have a ripple effect throughout college football in the state of Utah.\n\nWith the transfer portal opening on Jan. 2, Whittingham will quickly have to assemble his staff at Michigan.\n\nWhile Whittingham’s search for assistants will no doubt have a national reach, the former Utah coach has a notable coaching tree, and he could lean on his current and former assistant coaches while building a staff in Ann Arbor.\n\nHere are three notable names from Utah schools that Whittingham could potentially target while assembling a coaching staff.\n\nWhittingham is expected to target offensive coordinator Jason Beck for the same job at Michigan, according to CBS Sports’ Matt Zenitz.\n\nBeck turned around Utah’s offense in just one season, engineering the best year-to-year offensive improvement at Utah since at least 1996, according to the school.\n\nLed by mostly backup quarterbacks in 2024, Utah’s offense struggled, scoring 23.6 points per game (No. 102 in the nation) and totaling just 329.8 yards per game on offense (No. 115 in the nation).\n\nBeck, who was New Mexico’s offensive coordinator in 2024, brought quarterback Devon Dampier and receiver Ryan Davis from Albuquerque, and added running back Wayshawn Parker. Those new players, led by a veteran offensive line, injected much-needed life into Utah’s offense.\n\nBeck’s RPO-heavy scheme was run well by Dampier, and Utah’s offense scored 40.9 points per game (No. 5 in the nation) and rushed for 269.8 yards per game (No. 2 in the nation).\n\nBeck engineered one of the most successful offenses in the Whittingham era, so it would make sense that Whittingham would want continuity in Michigan, instead of starting fresh with a new offensive coordinator.\n\nOne of Whittingham’s first calls to his old staff at Utah would have to be to offensive line coach Jim Harding.\n\nHarding has been one of the top offensive line coaches in the nation during his time at Utah and did his best coaching job this season.\n\nWith a veteran group of returning starters, including tackles Spencer Fano and Caleb Lomu, Utah had one of the best offensive lines in the nation.\n\nThe Utes’ front five powered Utah to 3,237 rushing yards, just 27 yards off of breaking the school rushing record of 3,263, set in 1984.\n\nFano and Lomu are both potential first-round picks in this year’s NFL draft, with Fano considered the best offensive tackle available.\n\nThis summer, Harding landed a commitment from offensive tackle Kelvin Obot, who is Utah’s first-ever 247Sports composite five-star.\n\nHarding’s ability to recruit and develop talent on the offensive line has made him one of the country’s best position coaches and an attractive target for Whittingham’s staff at Michigan.\n\nJay Hill coached under Whittingham from 2005-2013 in various positions, including as Utah’s cornerbacks coach.\n\nHill left Utah in 2014 to become Weber State’s head coach, and in nine season in Ogden, Hill led the Wildcats to six playoff appearances.\n\nFollowing the 2022 season, Hill became Kalani Sitake’s defensive coordinator at BYU and turned around the Cougars’ defense.\n\nUnder Hill’s watch, BYU went from No. 96 in points allowed in 2022 (29.5 points per game) to No. 18 in 2024 (19.6 points per game) and No. 21 in 2025 (19 points per game).\n\nWith Whittingham’s connection to Hill, the current BYU defensive coordinator could be one of the top targets to call the Wolverines’ defense.",

    "fullText": "Lively college towns are pinnacles of American higher education.\n\nThe communities immediately surrounding college campuses can define what a student's college experience looks like, from having access to restaurants and bars to meeting students from nearby institutions.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a college or university to attend, location can be just as important as academics for some students.\n\nIn a recent study, WalletHub analyzed over 400 cities across the US and ranked them based on affordability, social scene, and academic prospects in 2025.\n\nTo analyze the cost of living (or \"wallet friendliness\"), WalletHub researchers examined data such as average housing costs, the cost of higher education, the share of rental units, and the average cost of pizza and burgers in each city.\n\nIts social rank was determined by factors like the share of the population aged 18-35, the share of single people, the student gender balance, and cafes, breweries, food trucks, and nightlife per capita, among other factors.\n\nWalletHub also looked at the quality of higher education, job-growth rate, earning potential for college graduates, and unemployment rate, among other factors, to determine each city's academic and economic opportunity rank.\n\nThe study used data from federal agencies including the US Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Center for Education Statistics, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as data from companies like TransUnion, TripAdvisor, and Yelp, along with other WalletHub research.\n\nThe list of top college towns — defined by WalletHub as cities with a college student population of over 7,500 students — includes a range of major cities and small education hubs.\n\nWhile some locations are major education hubs and house big universities alongside small private and public community colleges, we've listed the main flagship institution for each location.\n\nSee which college towns and cities made it to the top 20.\n\nThe home of Yale University, New Haven was ranked 38th in the study's academic and economic opportunities list, and it came second overall for quality of higher education, only behind Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nHowever, it also had the lowest rank out of top 20 cities in the study's social environment rank, and WalletHub noted it had one of the highest costs for higher education.\n\nRanked as the ninth-highest city in the study's social environment ranking, Charleston had the sixth-highest social ranking out of the top 20 cities.\n\nSchool: University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nMadison, Wisconsin, home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was ranked as the 42nd-best city in terms of social environment in the study, which looked at 415 towns and cities.\n\nSalt Lake City, home to the University of Utah, was ranked as the 17th best college town in America.\n\nOut of the top 20 cities, it had the lowest ranking on the study's economic and academic opportunity rank, which considered factors such as job-growth rate, earning potential for college graduates, and unemployment rate.\n\nSchool: University of Washington\n\nDespite its overall high ranking, Seattle was ranked as the lowest city in the top 20 in the wallet friendliness category, coming 360th out of the 415 places in the study.\n\nSchool: Florida State University\n\nThe capital city of Florida and home to Florida State University, Tallahassee, was the second-highest ranked city for wallet friendliness within the top 20, although it also had the second-lowest social rank out of the cities in the top 20.\n\nSchools: University of Miami, Florida International University\n\nMiami was ranked as the 14th best college town in the country, and the city also received the third-highest social rank in the top 20, ranking fourth overall out of all cities in the study.\n\nSchool: Scottsdale Community College\n\nScottsdale, Arizona, which houses the Scottsdale Community College and was ranked as the 13th best college town in the US, had the second-lowest ranking for wallet friendliness out of the top 20 cities.\n\nWalletHub also noted it had the second fewest students per capita of all the 415 cities in the study, behind only Cape Coral, Florida.\n\nSchools: Grand Canyon University\n\nPhoenix was ranked the 12th best college town in the US. The city is home to Grand Canyon University and is near other major universities in nearby towns.\n\nSchool: University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University\n\nHome to the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University among other institutions, Pittsburgh received the second-highest social rank out of top 20 cities, ranking third overall. The city was also ranked as the lowest out of the top 20 in the economic and academic opportunity rank.\n\nThe home of the University of Florida was the highest-ranked for wallet friendliness within the top 20 college towns.\n\nIt also had the fourth-lowest cost of higher education out of the 415 cities studied by WalletHub.\n\nHome to the University of Virginia, Charlottesville was ranked the third highest for academic and economic opportunity out of the top 20 college towns.\n\nSchool: University of Nevada, Reno\n\nRanked as the eighth-best college town in the US, Reno is home to the University of Nevada, Reno.\n\nSchools: Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia State University, Emory University, Spelman College, Morehouse College\n\nAtlanta is home to over a dozen major universities and over 50 higher education institutions.

    "description": "Justin Howells started at Target as a part-time hourly worker 23 years ago in San Diego and is now group vice president for the Pacific Northwest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Justin Howells, Target's group vice president for Pacific Northwest stores. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started as a Target team member 23 years ago, working part-time while attending college in San Diego.\n\nIt was not supposed to be a career — I just needed book money and some extra cash.\n\nOver time, I grew up, got married, had kids, and my career expanded. I've led stores, opened stores, and done everything in between, from that entry-level job to where I am now as group vice president for the Pacific Northwest, a role I've held for the last two years.\n\nThe core of what makes Target is our team.\n\nIt's like a small family in every building, and it's why I have stayed with the company as long as I have. There's a culture of development; a desire to teach and help you improve.\n\nNow, as a leader, I think it's important to let people get good at what they do.\n\nSometimes that takes time, but I've always appreciated an environment that allows me to learn from my mistakes as well as be good at what I'm currently working on.\n\nI've been really fortunate to work for a lot of people who don't just think about what I'm doing at the job. They care about how we're performing and what I'm adding to the company, but they've also cared about me as a person and my personal development.\n\nWe try to spend a lot of time talking to our team about what they want to achieve in their lives, and I think that's what has created such a stable structure within the teams I've worked for. It's the reason I stay.\n\nI enjoy retail, too. I like putting stuff on shelves and printing labels. To me, that's exciting. Other people might love to travel to other countries or be a teacher, but we need people for different things. I'm the person to help you find Tide and toothpaste.\n\nIn my view, the No. 1 rule is to have respect for everybody around you. Even now, I'll pick up trash off the floor. I'll clean the parking lot. Nobody is too good to do the job in front of you.\n\nIf you always have that mindset, you'll learn a lot from the people that you're working with.\n\nIt's also important to share what your dreams are and where you want to go in life.\n\nI started as a guy who pulled things forward on shelves every night of the week while I was in school, but I was always vocal about how I wanted to do the next thing. I told people I wanted to be a team leader, then I wanted to be an executive team leader, and then I wanted to be a store director.\n\nTalking about it and letting people know what your ambitions are is really important.\n\nAnd if you really want to go far in your career, continue to invest time and energy in the people around you.\n\nI don't pull things forward on shelves every night anymore; I have teams across multiple stores that do that for us, and I can't get anywhere without them.\n\nI never know when I might be standing next to a future group vice president who's putting away items in our stock room.\n\nWe keep the door open to everybody in case they might be interested in doing more.\n\nThey might have started because they thought, \"Hey, this is a good way for me to pay for books or bus money, but there's more for me in this company.\"\n\nThe possibilities are really endless if they're interested.",

    "description": "At Cincinnati College Prep, Jeff Cargile wants his students to succeed as much in the classroom as on the field. Get to know this football coach.",
    "fullText": "Jeff Cargile has been a beacon of hope for the Cincinnati College Prep Academy football team.\n\nIn four seasons, he's led the Lions to a 29-14 overall record, a three-peat of league titles and the school's first-ever regional semifinal appearance.\n\nBut the thing he's most proud of is that the team had a 3.1 grade-point average in the first quarter of this school year.\n\n\"Coaching football for me is more than just X's and O's. It's the life lessons that are taught along the way,\" Cargile wrote in an Oct. 19 Facebook post.\n\nHis coaching acumen and desire to see his students achieve bigger and better things helped turn CCPA into a consistent winner on and off the field.\n\n\"He's always been a guy with a lot of love. He doesn't know a stranger and he doesn't know an enemy,\" said St. Henry (Kentucky) head coach Tim Odom, who played against Cargile in high school and alongside him at Ohio State.\n\nIn 2019, Cargile's Taft Senators played in the Division V, Region 20 semifinals and had high hopes for the 2020 season.\n\nBut during that COVID-shortened season, Cincinnati Public Schools did not kick off until mid-September. It was the only school district in Southwest Ohio not to begin playing in late August. Cargile was among those who spoke publicly, saying they thought the decision hurt the students; he saw multiple players get into trouble with the law while they were unable to play football.\n\n\"Looking back on it now, I would have probably done it differently,\" Cargile said of the situation that may have led to him and Taft parting ways. \"But a lot of these kids, you have to merge (academics and athletics) together, because for a lot of them, that's what motivates them to be at school every day.\"\n\nHis main concern was that he didn't want to see his kids go down the same road he had in the 1990s and 2000s. Cargile is approaching 20 years free of drug and alcohol abuse and has spent time in jail for multiple offenses.\n\nIn 2015, the Ohio State Board of Education granted Cargile a certificate of qualification for employment (CQE) with the stipulation that he undergo a criminal background check one year later. He has had a spotless record since leaving prison in 2005.\n\n\"I've been to the penitentiary, I've been in and out of jail and treatment facilities. I've lost relationships with family members that I've had to regain. They don't have to do that because I already did. I've borne all that pain,\" Cargile said.\n\nAfter parting ways with Taft, a school he said he has no ill will toward, he was instantly given another opportunity by then-CCPA head coach Jeremy Pflug. Cargile was the defensive coordinator for one year before taking over as the head coach when Pflug left to coach at Woodward.\n\nMore: After losing parents, surviving fire, CCPA's Petey Jones finds crowning moment on football field\n\nWhile the Lions struggled in his first year and ended with a 5-6 record, they have won at least seven games in each of the last three years, including a trip to the regional semifinals in 2024.\n\nSuccess has followed Cargile everywhere he's gone. He had a 38-12 record in five years at Taft. After a college career where he was a three-year letter winner at Ohio State, he spent stints at Withrow, Madeira and his alma mater, Roger Bacon.\n\n\"He was the most talented competitor we played against in the GCL those years. He was an unbelievable running back and a tremendous human being,\" Odom said.\n\nCargile has a soft spot for small, urban schools because of his upbringing through Roger Bacon. He is most comfortable in those environments, and he said he believes that life has led him to those places because that's where he can have the greatest impact on his students.\n\n\"I try to run my program like a Power Five college program. I know I don't have all the resources a lot of these bigger schools have, but one of the things I used to hate hearing coaches and administrators say was, 'You can't do that stuff at Taft or at Withrow.' I've always come from the school of 'you can.'\" Cargile said. \"I'm very firm and very stern in my message to them, but I love my kids at the same time. I try to give them the best opportunities that I can.\"\n\nThe CMAC website listed 40 players on CCPA's 2025 roster. Only five were seniors.\n\nThe Lions, who went 8-3 this season and won a third straight CMAC-Blue title, return quarterback Kemmarion McCray, leading rusher Marlan Robertson, top receivers Kendrick Napier and Mario Meatchem, and defensive stars Sir Michael Miller, Charles Howard, Kenny Powe, Ryan Drew and Ramik Bell.\n\n\"I am so excited and I'm so anxious to get this offseason started. This team that I have coming back, there's no way that we should not be playing in the regional semi or the regional championship next year. I'm anxious for my kids to get to compete with the St. Henrys and the Marion Locals,\" Cargile said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Jeff Cargile brings compassion, winning attitude to CCPA football",

    "description": "Kiana Mei, 20, runs a jewelry brand and opted out of college. It's tiring, isolating work, but she says she doesn't regret it.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kiana Mei, 20, a small-business owner from Australia. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I turned 15, like all my friends, I wanted to get a job at a café to earn money. But my father pushed me to start my company young, and it's the reason I'm now financially independent at 20.\n\nI started selling origami butterfly artwork, a skill I picked up from a school trip to Japan and honed during the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nI started selling them at markets in Melbourne when I was 16. When I made my first sale to a lady who bought three of my artworks for $100, I was shocked. It was the first time I realized I could earn money with something I had made with my own hands.\n\nI added jewelry to the product mix not long after starting my company, Kiana Mei Designs, which sells affordable, customizable jewelry, as well as origami artworks.\n\nUntil the end of high school, I balanced school on weekdays and the markets on weekends. I passed my 12th grade with one of the highest grades in my school, which could qualify me for most college courses.\n\nBut I decided to go all in on my business for just one year, focusing on growing it instead of going to college. As I was running my business, I thought, \"What am I actually going to be studying in university that's related to business that I'm not already doing now?\"\n\nI now have a stall at Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne, open from Tuesday to Sunday. I've moved out of my parents' house, am financially independent, and don't regret anything.\n\nBut there are three things I wish I had known before diving headfirst into my business.\n\nThe first thing I wish I knew was the isolation I'd feel as a young business owner.\n\nI was still in school when I first started, so I had friends with whom I was quite close at the time, who shared similar academic interests.\n\nBut when I finished high school and moved out, and I started doing my own thing, those friends drifted away, and I wasn't as close with them anymore. We didn't have much in common.\n\nThere are not a lot of young business owners, especially in Melbourne and in Australia, and especially young female entrepreneurs. I've attended numerous networking events, but the people around me are a lot older than me, so it's harder to relate.\n\nI wish that I'd learned early on how to balance work and life, and how to switch off.\n\nLast Christmas, I think I was selling at my stall for 14 days straight without a break. The physical toll it takes is no joke — I think people don't really realize how taxing it can be on the body to stand all day.\n\nWhen I get sick and have a cold, I lose my voice completely. Last August, I lost my voice for five days, and that meant five days without work because I need to speak to customers.\n\nBut health always comes first, so I try to stay healthy.\n\nI make sure to get a workout in at 5 a.m., then eat a good breakfast before heading to the market. I go to bed around 10 p.m.\n\nIt's important to remember that your product isn't for everyone.\n\nI learned this in the very early days of my business. When customers would walk past my stall without talking to me, I used to feel a sense of rejection.\n\nI would think, \"Why didn't they stop?\" and I would overthink everything.\n\nWhen it comes to retail, you shouldn't overthink it, because not everyone will like your product, and not everyone will like you. You have to find the people who truly appreciate your products.\n\nOver time, I've come to accept that. When I'm at the market, of course, I'll try to speak to everyone, but if someone doesn't say hello back to me, or if someone doesn't want to stop and have a look, then it doesn't mean anything to me.\n\nIt's just on to the next person.",

    "fullText": "LSU Tigers star safety AJ Haulcy is ending his college football career as he declares for the NFL draft, per Hayes Fawcett of On3Sports.\n\nLike teammate Mansoor Delane, Haulcy transferred to the Tigers this past season with hopes of getting more eyes on him and building up his draft stock. Both players succeeded in big ways.\n\nHaulcy led LSU in tackles this past season with 88. He also added three interceptions, four passes broken up, and a forced fumble. He held his own in coverage and was a thumper in the run game. There's nothing else the Tigers could have asked him to do.\n\nThere was a four-week stretch where he finished with at least 12 tackles in each game. It felt like he was involved in every play that went into the box. His best individual game was in the losing effort against the Texas A&M Aggies, when he had 12 tackles with an interception and a pass break up.\n\nThe Texas native is a major college football success story. He came out of high school as a three-star recruit. 247Sports had him ranked as the 150th best safety in that class and the 266th best player in his home state.\n\nHe was viewed with more respect as a transfer, but he still ended up outplaying those expectations. He was the 151st player in the portal and the third-ranked safety. Now, he's going to be one of the first safeties taken in the NFL draft, receiving some second-round evaluations.\n\nHaulcy now becomes the third player from this Tigers team to declare for the draft, joining Delane and Aaron Anderson.",

    "fullText": "Matt Patricia is used to postseason runs from his days as the defensive coordinator of the New England Patriots.\n\nHowever, Patricia acknowledges that the preparation for the College Football Playoff is different than the NFL. Patricia is in his first season as Ohio State's defensive coordinator as the second-seeded Buckeyes (12-1) get ready to face 10th-seeded Miami (11-2) in a CFP quarterfinal at the Cotton Bowl on Dec. 31.\n\n“It’s a learning (process) for me. We’d have bye-week kind of moments in the NFL, but this is a really long layover and break,” Patricia said. “Right now, I’m trying to trust the expertise in the building. Some of the things we did transfer, you know, because we have some different kind of scheduling and when everybody is in school and that stuff.”\n\nOhio State was off for two weeks after its 13-10 loss to Indiana in the Big Ten championship game on Dec. 6. Players were mostly occupied with final exams while waiting to see who they would face in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nWith the Buckeyes going for consecutive national championships for the first time in school history, Patricia's first season in Columbus has exceeded expectations. He was hired after Jim Knowles left for Penn State, tasked with leading a unit that returned only three starters, none on the defensive line.\n\nPatricia and Ohio State made an emphatic opening statement in their Aug. 30 14-7 victory over Texas and continued the momentum throughout the season.\n\nThe Buckeyes are ranked either first or second nationally in nine different categories. They lead the nation in scoring defense (8.2 points per game), passing yards (129.1), red zone scores (66.7%) and fewest plays of 10 or more yards (90).\n\nOhio State had three AP All-America first-team selections on the defense — defensive tackle Kayden McDonald, linebacker Arvell Reese and safety Caleb Downs. All three plus linebacker Sonny Styles are projected to be first-round picks in April's NFL draft.\n\nPatricia, who returned to coaching in college for the first time since 2002, is a finalist for the Broyles Award, which is given to the top assistant coach in college football.\n\n“The players have done an unbelievable job. Again, give them all the credit. I think they’ve played so hard and aggressive and flying around on the field. And it is a lot of fun. I tell them all the time, it’s such a privilege to be up there in front of the group and talk to the group,” Patricia said. “And just for me, personally, it has been so much fun to come back to college and have that little bit of a youthful energy with the players that we have here and their excitement to go out and play.”\n\nWhen Patricia was hired, many lauded his ability to adjust his personnel by running multiple fronts and coverages. He also has shown the ability to relate to players.\n\n“When he first stepped on campus here, it was like a long-lost family member that just came back from whatever he came from, but he came back home,” defensive end Kenyatta Jackson said. “And I mean, all the guys love him. Even offensive guys. He don’t just talk to the starters or whatever the case may be, but he talks to everybody. And I think that’s why everybody loves him.”\n\nOne person who hasn't been surprised with Patricia's success is the guy who hired him.\n\n“His background speaks for itself and putting guys into a situation to be successful. And every player just wants someone that’s going to be there to get them better but also wants someone to care about them. He’s done both of those things,\" coach Ryan Day said. \"It’s great to have somebody in the building who has been through some of the games he’s been through, the Super Bowls and a lot of playoff games, so there’s a confidence level the guys have in him. So, I think all of that adds up to what you’re seeing.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "description": "My adult son moved home and attended a different church from me. I wondered if he was pushing me away, but he's forging his own path.",
    "fullText": "\"Are you coming to the 9 o'clock service with us?\" I asked my 22-year-old son. It was a Saturday night, a month or so after he had moved home after graduating from college.\n\n\"Actually, I'm going to check out the Catholic church,\" he replied.\n\nI paused. The fact that he wanted to attend the Catholic church was somewhat surprising, but not shocking. After all, his girlfriend of three years was Catholic. She lived a few hours away, having moved there to attend graduate school.\n\nI felt disappointed that he would rather attend the Catholic church alone than go to our Protestant church. I wondered if he had rejected his father, me, and our traditions.\n\nWhen my son moved back home after graduating last spring, we welcomed this bonus time with him as we readjusted to sharing a house again.\n\nGone was the gangly teen who left home at age 18, replaced by a young man focused on his new career. It struck me as surreal that we could chat about work like peers over the dinner table, then seconds later, I'd be nagging him to hang up his towel from the bathroom floor.\n\nIt felt like I had my son back, but something had changed.\n\nWhile our family had always attended church, finding support and meaning there, my son had not been enthusiastic about going, especially as a teenager. He never wanted to attend the youth group, saying he didn't click with the other kids. Later, when we dropped him off at college armed with a list of local churches and student fellowship groups to check out, he didn't speak of them.\n\nHe seemed to wander away from his faith for a while, or at least let it simmer in the background.\n\nThat changed when he moved home after college. He started coming to church with us again. It felt like another way my son came back to me. But after checking out the Catholic church in town, he started attending mass there regularly.\n\nI saw that my son was taking his faith journey more seriously, and it made me quietly pleased. Still, it continued to bother me that he was no longer attending the same church as my husband and me.\n\n\"Where's the big guy?\" our pastor inquired about our son a couple of months ago.\n\nWhen I shared the news that my son was attending the Catholic church in town, our pastor nodded thoughtfully. I followed this up with the happy news that my son had proposed to his girlfriend and they were now engaged. When I mentioned his fiancée was Catholic, our pastor broke into a smile.\n\nHe expressed genuine support for my son attending a different church, emphasizing how important it was for our son to pursue a deeper relationship with God at the same place his fiancée worshiped. It would only make him a better husband, he concluded.\n\nI felt a range of emotions: surprise, relief, and happiness. My pastor flipped my perspective, and rightly so. I realized my son wasn't rejecting us; rather, he was pursuing his independence and preparing for a life with his fiancée.\n\nHe wasn't walking away from us, but using the seeds his dad and I may have planted all those years we took him to church to grow his faith along a path that belonged to him.\n\nMy son and his fiancée are planning their wedding for later next year. They'll marry in a Catholic church, and I will be blessed to watch them commit to each other there. I'm grateful he found his faith again, and that what once felt like him drifting away was really him growing toward his own adult faith and future.",

    "fullText": "The father of Leah Palmirotto, a 19-year-old who fell from a building featured in Stranger Things, is speaking out after her death earlier this month\n\nTodd Palmirotto Jr. said he believes this was not the first time his daughter had visited the property\n\nHe remembered her as \"perfect\" and said he hopes her death was \"instant\"\n\nThe father of a young woman is speaking out after she died earlier this month in a fall from an unused college building that had been featured in Netflix's Stranger Things.\n\nLeah Palmirotto, 19, is believed to have been exploring the vacant structure on Emory University’s Briarcliff campus with a group of people when she fell to her death, according to local news reports.\n\nShe was pronounced dead at the scene on Friday, Dec. 19.\n\nThe building had been used as the Hawkins National Laboratory in Stranger Things and was also previously featured in The Vampire Diaries.\n\nIn an interview this week, Todd Palmirotto Jr., Leah’s father, recalled the moment police came to his door with news of her death, according to local outlet WAGA.\n\n“She was perfect,” Todd said, adding, “I was blown away. I just wasn’t sure.”\n\nHe said he believes this was not the first time his daughter had visited the property where she died. Authorities are still looking into what led Leah to fall.\n\n“We just kind of always had something in the back of our mind that something could happen,\" he explained.\n\nStill, he said, \"I’m just hoping it [the fall] was instant. I just hope she felt no pain,\" Leah's dad said.\n\nTodd said that visiting properties like the one where his daughter died is “dangerous” and suggested Leah may have been with people she “really don’t know.”\n\nAs of midday on Tuesday, Dec. 23, more than $2,500 has been raised through a GoFundMe campaign started to support Leah’s family.\n\nTom Cavanaugh, a family friend who organized the online fundraiser, said donations will go toward covering Leah’s funeral and memorial costs.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nAccording to Cavanaugh, Leah had an affinity for photography and “loved exploring and photographing abandoned buildings.”\n\n“She was a beautiful and vibrant young lady originally from Florida who lived for the beach and outdoors,” Cavanaugh wrote. “She was always the popular kid in school and got along with everybody. Her family is left absolutely heartbroken.”\n\nLeah is survived by her father, her mother and two brothers, Cavanaugh said.\n\nAn informal memorial will take place at a Kennesaw park on Tuesday, according to WAGA.",

    "description": "College football has never been more transactional than it is right now. That’s what makes the culture that Kenny Dillingham has created stand out.",
    "fullText": "College football has never been more transactional than it is right now.\n\nWith players allowed to make money through Name, Image and Likeness deals and a transfer portal that currently features 852 athletes, the sport is truly in a new day and age. Private equity is starting to get involved, adding to the corporate feel that is growing.\n\nThat’s what makes the culture that Arizona State football coach Kenny Dillingham has created in Tempe stand out. Yes, Dillingham might be the most easy-going coach in college football when it comes to the transfer portal. Not many other coaches will wish you good luck and promote your transfer on social media.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean ASU is just a bus stop and hoping to reload with transfer portal players every season. There’s a sense of real connection within the building.\n\nSophomore linebacker Martell Hughes was recruited from high school in San Diego as part of the second class signed under Dillingham. Hughes said he was drawn in specifically because of Dillingham.\n\n“The culture that coach Kenny had defined, that he wanted to bring, especially with all the new guys he brought in with the portal,” Hughes said. “The plan he had built for this and the city of Tempe. Just believing in him and the coaching staff is what ultimately brought me here.”\n\nThe word is used throughout the world of sports, yet there is no one singular definition. It’s different everywhere.\n\n“Being a family, being passionate, having the love and want to do this and day in and day out,” Hughes said. “He talks about it every day. Football is hard, and it’s a violent game, but if you don’t love it, there’s no point in doing it. His passion and love for his guys on the team, staff, it just runs through everybody. It’s infectious.”\n\nOr, as Dillingham has made the motto of the team: “Have more fun while working harder than anybody in the country.”\n\nThe phrase is blasted all over the team’s walls and has been repeated countless times by Dillingham and his players. Now, it has come to personify the nature of these Sun Devils.\n\nIt’s one of the reasons why Hughes has stayed in Tempe, instead of entering the portal and trying to get more playing time elsewhere.\n\n“Coming out of high school, they took the chance on me,” Hughes said. “They mapped out a plan for me and for this program. Believing in them. Why would I jump ship when they put their all into me?”\n\nThat belief is on track to pay off as Hughes, after learning and developing from Keyshaun Elliott and Jordan Crook the past two seasons, appears ready to move up the depth chart entering 2026. Hughes had the game-sealing interception in the win against TCU.\n\nEven for players who have spent time in other locker rooms, like graduate student and offensive lineman Ben Coleman, the culture at ASU is distinctive.\n\nColeman played 25 games at the University of California and earned his bachelor's and master's there before transferring to Tempe. He played the last two seasons for Arizona State after receiving an extra year of eligibility.\n\n“It’s different here,” Coleman said. “It’s very personal the way they challenge us, in the weight room, on the football field. The way they will us to compete in everything we do. Doesn’t matter if it’s Madden, (NBA) 2K, bringing a hoop out here, playing knockout. Everything is competing. That’s why we have a basketball hoop in the football team room, for that exact reason.”\n\nThe competition never ends. The team tracks what every player does and compiles it. It's referred to as “Skittles Wars.” From breakfast check-in to study hall and reps in the weight room, nothing goes unnoticed. At the end of the season, a winner is declared.\n\n“You wake up, and the first thing you do before you even open a notebook is, ‘Hey man. Let’s compete right now,’” Coleman said. “If you can’t compete, he doesn’t want anybody there who doesn’t want to compete.”\n\nLike Coleman, defensive lineman Justin Wodtly spent time in other locker rooms, playing at Cincinnati before transferring ahead of the 2024 season. Some of those locker rooms were strictly football, nothing else.\n\n“I’ve had three head coaches,” Wodtly said. “Here, it shows how much Coach Dillingham really cares about the team, how much he cares about building relationships, how much he cares about your life outside of football. Doing all those things is a testament to who he is as a person.”\n\nPerhaps the person who most embodies — literally — the culture that has been created at Arizona State is Wodtly.\n\nOnly 18 months passed before Wodtly decided to make ASU part of his body, getting a sprawling tattoo on his right calf with Sparky’s pitchfork as the centerpiece, set in front of a desert landscape with saguaros, mountains and lightning in the sky.\n\nAnd more could be on the way in the future.\n\n“It’s a huge part of me, who I am,” Wodtly said. “I appreciate this university. I’m very grateful for the time I got to spend here. I might have to add to it soon.”\n\nLogan Stanley is a sports reporter with The Arizona Republic who primarily focuses on high school, college and Olympic sports.

The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.\n\nRead our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree here\n\nWhen work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.\n\nRead our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 here\n\nWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.\n\nRead our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake here\n\nFew games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.\n\nRead our review of Expedition 33 here.\n\nI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time.\n\nRead our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds here\n\nIf you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.\n\nRead our review of Split Fiction here.\n\nThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that \"one more run\" itch.\n\nRead our review of Ball X Pit here\n\nIf you are \n\nRead our review of Blue Prince here\n\nWould you trust your best friends to help you climb a mountain? What about your family? Well, wonder no longer, as, thanks to indie developer Team Peak, you will now be able to do just that (in a safe, non-real-world scenario) with Peak. This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive. With cute visuals, proximity chat, climbing items to help you, and more, all helped push Peak to the top of Steam charts this year, and it is a great time to check out while on break this holiday.\n\nCheck out a bit of the history behind Peak here\n\nWhether it's Ultimate, Brawl, Melee, or any of the other variations, I have never attended a gathering that Super Smash Bros. hasn't improved. The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old. While the world anxiously waits for the word of a Switch 2 Smash, the old versions are just as fun to revisit, so grab some controllers and prepare to fight!\n\nRead our review of Super Smash Bros.

The tech leader even says he’s envious of young people because our early-career jobs will look “boring” by comparison.\n\nAs AI reshapes the workforce, many Gen Z college graduates are finding out the hard way that their degrees don’t guarantee a smooth career launch.\n\nNow, even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman—one of Silicon Valley’s biggest leaders driving the AI revolution—is admitting the elephant in the room is true: AI will wipe out some jobs entirely. However, the tech billionaire insists the coming decade could be the most exciting time in history to start a career, especially for anyone who’s ever dreamed of working in space.\n\nNot only will they be reeling in sky-high salaries, but Altman says they’ll also be “feeling so bad for you and I that we had to do this really boring, old work and everything is just better.”\n\n“In 2035, that graduating college student, if they still go to college at all, could very well be leaving on a mission to explore the solar system on a spaceship in some completely new, exciting, super well-paid, super interesting job,” Altman told video journalist Cleo Abram.\n\nThough it’s unclear how widespread space exploration will expand in the coming years—considering NASA’s broad goal of getting to Mars in the 2030s—aerospace engineers are growing faster than the national average of all jobs, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And they bring home an envy-inducing annual paycheck of over $130,000.\n\nOther tech pioneers have AI predictions that are more grounded on Earth—but still alluring to workers. For example, billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said that the technology might dramatically reduce the length of the workweek, thanks to humans no longer being needed “for most things.”\n\n“What will jobs be like? Should we just work like two or three days a week?” the tech billionaire told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed that AI has already given his workers “superhuman” skills—something that will only increase as the technology advances.\n\n“I’m surrounded by superhuman people and super intelligence, from my perspective, because they’re the best in the world at what they do. And they do what they do way better than I can do it. And I’m surrounded by thousands of them. Yet it never one day caused me to think, all of a sudden, I’m no longer necessary,” he separately told Cleo Abram on her Huge Conversations podcast series.\n\nWhile Altman admitted that his crystal ball remains foggy—and that the true direction of AI is unclear—he is actually envious of Gen Z professionals starting off their careers: “If I were 22 right now and graduating college, I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history,” he added to Abram.\n\nFortune reached out to OpenAI for comment.\n\nAfter the launch of OpenAI model, GPT-5, Altman declared the world has access to technology equivalent to a “team of PhD-level experts” right in their pocket. And as a result, the CEO said it will be easier than ever for one person to create a business that used to take “hundreds” of people—all it takes is coming up with a great idea and mastering AI tools.\n\n“It is probably possible now to start a company, that is a one-person company that will go on to be worth more than a billion dollars, and more importantly than that, deliver an amazing product and service to the world, and that is like a crazy thing,” he said.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban has gone even further with his prediction, saying that AI could give Elon Musk a run for his money as the world’s richest person.\n\n“We haven’t seen the best or the craziest of what [AI is] going to be able to do,” Cuban told the High Performance podcast. “And not only do I think it’ll create a trillionaire, but it could be just one dude in the basement. That’s how crazy it could be.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on August 11, 2025.\n\n‘Godmother of AI’ says degrees are less important in hiring than how quickly you can ‘superpower yourself’ with new tools\n\nForget the four-day workweek, Elon Musk predicts you won’t have to work at all in ‘less than 20 years’\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos says ‘millions of people’ will be living in space by 2045—and robots will commute on our behalf to the moon\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

The Buckeyes are 8-3, but have not shot the ball particularly well lately, hitting just 26% of their three-pointers over the past five games.\n\nGrambling comes into Tuesday’s game as winners of each of their last two games, bringing their season record to 5-6. They are one of the very worst teams in the nation at taking care of the basketball, turning the ball over on 21.8% of their possessions. While they can be disruptive on the defensive end, they also struggle to take care of it themselves. This is the second meeting every between the two programs, with Ohio State having won the first game in 2015.\n\nThe Buckeyes have fallen to 16th in the Big Ten in three-point shooting at 33.7%. The last time Ohio State shot 33.7% or lower as a team from three-point range was the 2015-16 season, when OSU shot 33.4%.\n\nConnect with Connor: \nTwitter: @lemons_connor",

    "title": "Wooden Award Flashback: Rick Barnes cements legacy as one of college basketball's great coaches",
    "description": "The John R.",
    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it's 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nWhen Rick Barnes was handed the 2018 Coach Wooden \"Keys to Life\" Award, it was noted how his life displayed the character traits of integrity and leadership in the game of basketball, reflecting the values of legendary coach John Wooden.\n\nIt's long been the University of Tennessee coach's mantra, consistently blending culture, development, and adaptability for the young men he's mentored since beginning his coaching career in 1977.\n\nBarnes, who ranks among the all-time Top 20 winningest men's college basketball coaches, hasn't just been a coach who wins games; he's built sustainable programs.\n\nBarnes turned Clemson into a national contender in the 1990s, he elevated Texas into a national power with regular NBA talent, and more recently, he's rebuilt Tennessee into one of the SEC’s most consistent teams.\n\nBarnes went to the Final Four with Texas in 2003, won the Big East Tournament with Providence in 1994 and the SEC Tournament in 2022 with Tennessee.\n\nHe's also won a combined five regular-season conference championships with Texas and Tennessee.\n\nThere have been very few coaches who have succeeded at three different top-tier major schools.\n\nThough he's known for being a demanding coach, he's never fallen short of the respect he's received from players.\n\nBarnes has always been clear about his standards for effort and behavior. His players have learned there are no shortcuts toward minutes earned, and he's always allowed for strong locker-room leadership\n\nMany of his former players often talk about how much Barnes helped them mature as men, not just as athletes, a culture that leads to consistency year after year.\n\nAs for his coaching style, Barnes' teams are almost always physically tough behind a disciplined defense. They've typically been stellar with their half-court defense.\n\nHis teams have long been known for elite defensive efficiency, ball pressure, and rebounding. Defense has consistently given him a reliable floor every season, even when the offense fluctuates.\n\nEmphatic about established player development, Barnes always excels at developing players who elect to stay multiple years under his tutelage. Guards have been known to improve their decision-making and tenacity, his bigs get fundamentally stronger defensively and role players have notoriously grown into stars.\n\nMany of his best teams weren’t loaded with one-and-done talent, but with grown, experienced players who understood their roles.\n\nHis roster-building skills generally start with his knack for recruiting players who fit the system before they even arrive in the locker room.\n\nRather than chasing only top-5 recruits, Barnes prioritizes toughness, coachability and a defensive-mindset.\n\nCurrently, at Tennessee, Barnes has found players who fit the SEC grind and who buy into a team-basketball philosophy.\n\nUltimately, that translates into a mirror image of Barnes, who promotes consistency over flash.\n\nDespite being criticized for not having a national title, Barnes' real strength has producing his fair share of winning seasons, regular NCAA tournament appearances, getting his players to commit to higher standards and promoting the type of reliability that is extremely valuable in college basketball.\n\nThis former Wooden \"Keys to Life\" Award winner will go down as someone known as a teacher, culture-builder and defensive tactician who adapted over six decades without worrying about flash, but more so toughness and competitive consistency year after year.",

    "fullText": "Jacob Rodriguez was sleeping on the floor of his brother’s apartment and learning how to really play defense when he joined Texas Tech for spring practice in 2022, right after a season as a quarterback at Virginia.\n\nSuddenly a walk-on on the other side of the ball, Rodriguez even wondered if he might get cut by the Red Raiders.\n\n\"They’re trying to weed everybody out because it’s coach (Joey) McGuire’s first offseason,\" he said. “So, I'm just out there trying to make the team and then focus on football. It was real weird, totally different position.”\n\nQB-turned-linebacker Rodriguez is now an AP All-American for fourth-ranked Tech, which is in the College Football Playoff for the first time. The team captain with a distinctive mustache, whose wife flies Black Hawk helicopters in the U.S. Army, has a collection of trophies for national defensive player of the year awards, and was fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting. He is the first FBS player in 20 years with at least five forced fumbles (he has seven), two fumble recoveries and four interceptions in the same season.\n\n“He’s just a man of consistency, a man of routine and he’s just a great leader overall,” said Tech senior edge rusher David Bailey, a first-year transfer and also an AP All-America first-teamer.\n\nThe Red Raiders (12-1), in McGuire's fourth season, play No. 5 Oregon (12-1) in the CFP quarterfinal Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. The first-time Big 12 Conference champions already have a school-record 12 wins.\n\nRodriguez won the Chuck Bednarik and Bronko Nagurski awards as the top defensive player, and the Dick Butkus Award as the top linebacker. He got the Lombardi Award that's for exceptional performance while embodying character and discipline like the award's namesake.\n\nRodriguez played a little bit of safety in high school, but when he got to Tech he hadn’t been a linebacker since middle school, when the approach was much different.\n\n“I had no clue what I was doing. I was just going see ball, hit ball,” he said. “You’re playing linebacker, but you don’t have to study film, and you don’t have to understand the position as much.”\n\nAs a prep starting quarterback, Rodriguez accounted for 10,136 total yards (7,085 passing, 3,051 rushing) and 106 touchdowns (68 passing, 38 rushing) as Wichita Falls Rider made the Texas Class 5A playoffs three years in a row. He was then an early enrollee at Virginia, which gave him a scholarship offer as a quarterback. He never threw a pass in his 12 games with the Cavaliers, but had 56 yards rushing and 65 receiving while used as a running back, receiver and tight end. He left there after a coaching change.\n\n“It’s just really cool to see the way that his story has developed, and the kind of guy that he is,” said fifth-year Tech quarterback Behren Morton, a fellow Texan who was in some of the same camps as Rodriguez before college. “He’s probably put on close to 50 pounds, and just totally transformed his body to looking like a mean linebacker.”\n\nRodriguez played special teams and some defensive packages during his Tech debut in 2022, when he had 29 tackles and began to embrace being on that side.\n\n“Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play. I’ve done it on the offensive side of the ball, I’ve done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I’ve done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. “That’s kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.”\n\nHe was limited to five games in 2023 after injuring his foot in the opener on a play that he forced and recovered a fumble. His 127 tackles last year were the most for a Tech player since Lawrence Flugence set an NCAA FBS record with 193 in 2002. He has 117 this season after Tech reportedly invested more than $7 million on transfers along the defensive front, including Bailey, second-team AP All-America interior lineman A.J. Holmes Jr., and third-teamer Lee Hunter.\n\nAs tough as Rodriguez is, the 6-foot-1, 235-pound linebacker said there is no doubt that his wife Emma is even tougher.\n\nThe high school sweethearts got married in July 2023. Emma graduated from the United States Military Academy and is now based at Fort Riley in Kansas.\n\n\"She's the best, and she does so much for me,\" Jacob Rodriguez said. \"It's weird, I feel like to everybody else, that we do long distance and have done it. But I mean to us, it’s normal. It’s something that we’ve always done.”\n\nWhile disappointed he didn't get an invitation to New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony, Rodriguez was grateful and honored by the final results. His 17 first-place votes were nine more than Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin, the fourth-place finisher. Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman ahead of Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love.\n\n“I’m just so appreciative to even be in that conversation,\" Rodriguez said. \"That kind of hit home, was people really cared about me and see what the work that’s been done this year.”\n\nRodriguez has scored three touchdowns this season. He returned a fumble for a score against Oklahoma, and had short rushing TDs on his only carries when taking a direct snap in each of the last two regular-season games.\n\n“It was exciting and it was fun,” he said. “Those are the moments that I’ll never forget, where it’s just having fun playing football.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "South Carolina quarterback Air Noland plans to enter the transfer portal, On3’s Pete Nakos reports.\n\nNoland has spent one season apiece at two programs, as he redshirted at Ohio State, as part of a team for the Buckeyes that won the national title in the College Football Playoff, before coming to South Carolina. He then made his first career appearances this past fall as a backup for the Gamecocks.\n\nAfter not playing while in Columbus, Noland appeared off the sideline in two non-conference wins, one early in the year and one late, this season in Columbia. He came off the sideline in wins over South Carolina State in September and Coastal Carolina in November, as he is 2-3 (66.7%) for 13 yards while also having a rush for four yards.\n\nA native of College Park, Georgia, Noland played his high school football at Langston Hughes in Fairburn. He ranked as a Top-60 overall recruit there and as a four-star prospect in the 2024 recruiting cycle. He also rated as the No. 5 QB in the class and as a Top-10 player out of the state of Georgia. That’s according to Rivals’ Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He’d then arrive as one of the top signees for the Buckeyes in what was the No. 4 class in the country per Rivals’ Industry Team Recruiting Rankings.\n\nHowever, Noland has yet to be able to win a starting job to this point early in his career. He wasn’t expected to start last year at Ohio State, behind names like Will Howard, Devin Brown, Julian Sayin, and Lincoln Kienholz, as well as the eventual arrival the next offseason of Tavien St. Clair. However, after a year of backing up LaNorris Sellers, Noland likely expected to take the job for the Gamecocks as early as next fall, but Sellers is now anticipated to stay for another season at South Carolina rather than entering his name into the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nNoland has yet to get a real opportunity through two seasons at two programs in his collegiate career. He’ll now be looking for that in his third team in as many years, being a redshirt sophomore there with three years of eligibility remaining wherever he ends up next, once his name is officially in come the opening of the portal’s two-week window on January 2nd.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.\n\nThe On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "description": "Clint Crawford has a message for parents who are concerned about the shortage of white-collar entry-level work: open their minds to the possibility of a fulfilling career otherwise.",
    "fullText": "When something breaks—whether it’s the plumbing or a car—the first call most people make is to a blue-collar worker. That was the lesson he wanted his children to understand.\n\nClint Crawford is a 55-year-old automotive technician at Midas Auto and Repair Shop in Arkansas. He has a message for parents who are concerned about the shortage of white-collar entry-level work: open their minds to the possibility of a fulfilling career elsewhere.\n\nLike the conversation Ford CEO Jim Farley described having at his own dinner table with his son, Crawford believes it should be a debate—one that needs to happen at dinner tables across the country.\n\n“They need to be introduced to alternatives, and we need to place an equal importance on technical programs,” he asserts.\n\nCrawford has a 22-year-old daughter and a 21-year-old son. Both went to college, but it wasn’t expected of them as the default while growing up, as he worked to emphasize the dignity and stability that comes with blue-collar careers.\n\n“If something happens with the plumbing, the first call is either the landlord or the plumber,” Crawford tells Fortune, adding that when a car breaks down, the first call goes to a repair shop.\n\n“The first call that most people are going to make is to that blue-collar worker.”\n\nThose were the examples he gave his children when counseling them on what career to pursue, believing that such workers are essential to the running of the economy and to the smooth functioning of everyday life.\n\n“That way, they could understand that there are options,” Crawford says.\n\nHe also urged his children to be realistic, something many parents can now relate to. While the majority of parents still prefer a four-year college education for their children, a new survey from American Student Assistance found that 35% believe some form of technical education or a blue-collar career may be better suited for their child. In 2019, that figure was 13%.\n\nAnd it makes sense. Most white-collar entry-level jobs require a college degree, which has become a severe economic burden for younger generations. According to a 2024 report by the Education Data Initiative, the average Gen Zer has $22,948 of student loan debt. In addition, companies have reduced their rates of hiring entry-level employees, in part due to tariff disruptions as well as AI automating some of these early work experiences.\n\nCrawford himself was concerned when his son decided to study data science, having heard—like many others—about struggles in hiring. But he realized that “it’s something that he enjoys, and he’s good at. And so computer science it is.”\n\nIdeally, Crawford believes schools and parents should start these types of conversations early on. For his kids, they decided college was, in fact, right for them. But they had a conversation, which he encourages others to have.\n\nFor Crawford’s family, career discussions took place before his kids earned college degrees, and he encouraged his kids to be practical.\n\n“I think a lot of times parents are telling their kids, you know, do what makes you happy.” That’s great, he says, but adds that “the reason we work is to pay bills.” If a worker can’t do that or is underpaid, “it just seems pointless.”\n\nCrawford believes people should consider these jobs as valid options that offer stability—something that seems hard-won these days. Young people should be offered aptitude tests to help determine what kind of work best aligns with their skills. When someone is good at math, he believes they should be encouraged to pursue blue-collar careers that require highly logical and math-heavy processes.\n\nCrawford has found that electricians are “incredibly math-oriented” and that liking math doesn’t mean you have to be a mathematician.\n\n“There are plenty of opportunities out there that require a strong background in math that don’t limit you to teaching math at the high school or college level,” he adds.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Oregon Ducks successfully advanced to the quarterfinals of the College Football Playoff against James Madison. Despite the Ducks keeping their season afloat, coach Dan Lanning said his team has a lot of work to do upon speaking to reporters Saturday following the win.\n\n“We didn’t play our best football,” Lanning said. “We turned the ball over multiple times and we’ve got to play better on defense. It was like a tale of two halves. We played well in the first half but didn’t play well in the second. We can play so much better than that.”\n\nLanning said the Rose Bowl loss to Ohio State this past season still bothers him, but suggests this year's team can find the resilience to pull through to keep rolling.\n\n“Getting better, period,” Lanning said. “Getting better. We got an opportunity to advance, and now we get an opportunity to improve.”\n\nMore specifically, Lanning was not happy with the Ducks' 34-6 halftime lead being squandered away.\n\n“We started off hot,” Lanning said. “We can be better. In the second half, as a team, we didn’t play the way we needed to play. You have to find moments like that when you have a big lead, to be able to choke somebody out and we didn’t do that.”\n\nThe Ducks will play the Texas Tech Red Raidersin the Capital One Orange Bowl on New Year's Day, with kickoff set for noon ET.\n\nGiven the meteoric run the Red Raiders have been on, especially led by linebacker Jacob Rodriguez, Ducks quarterback Dante Moore will have little room for error once the game finally gets underway.\n\nWe'll see if the Ducks can clean up their mistakes.",

Retzlaff took over as BYU’s starter for the final four games of the season following an injury to Kedon Slovis, famously becoming the first Jewish starting quarterback in school history.\n\nThough Retzlaff went 0-4 to finish 2023, he won the starting QB job over transfer Gerry Bohanon in 2024 and piloted the Cougars to a 11-2 mark to tie for first place in the Big 12 Conference and capture an Alamo Bowl victory over Colorado.\n\nRetzlaff was expected to start for BYU again in 2025, but a civil lawsuit filed this past May accusing him of sexual assault and battery resulted in his withdrawal from the school and eventual enrollment at Tulane. The case was ultimately dismissed in June.\n\nDespite joining the Green Wave just weeks before the start of fall camp, Retzlaff won the team’s starting quarterback job and powered Tulane to a 10-2 regular season and American Conference championship game win over North Texas, clinching the program’s first-ever CFP appearance.\n\nEarlier this week, ESPN wrote Retzlaff could be selected as high as the sixth round of April’s NFL draft.",

    "fullText": "Who will Ole Miss play next? Explaining the 2025 CFP bracket opponent for Round 2 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe No. 6 Ole Miss Rebels have emphatically answered the question of whether they can win without Lane Kiffin. In their first game since Kiffin left for LSU, and the biggest game in program history, the Rebels delivered a dominant performance at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, crushing the No. 11 Tulane Green Wave 41-10, to advance in the College Football Playoff. New head coach Pete Golding is now 1-0 in his debut, proving the 12-1 Rebels are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe victory showcased the Rebels' strength and determination despite the unusual mid-playoff coaching change. While Tulane allowed Jon Sumrall, the next head coach at Florida, to coach his final contest for the Green Wave, Ole Miss proved that its players were singularly focused on the championship path.\n\nWhat is certain, however, is that Ole Miss's reward for the decisive win is an immediate clash with one of the best coaches and teams in college football. That team is the No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs, led by two-time national champion head coach Kirby Smart. Georgia once again steamrolled the competition, finishing the season 12-1 and defeating Alabama to claim its fourth SEC championship under Smart. Entering the playoff, Smart owns a career record of 117-20, cementing Georgia as the preeminent power in the sport.\n\nThe Rebels will now travel to New Orleans to face Georgia in the Sugar Bowl quarterfinal on New Year’s Day. The game is a highly anticipated rematch of their regular-season contest on October 18, which Georgia won 43-35 after rattling off 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to hand Ole Miss its only loss of the season. The Bulldogs will be looking to rewrite the script from last season, when they were eliminated in the Sugar Bowl by Notre Dame.\n\nHere’s more on the highly anticipated SEC rematch between Ole Miss and Georgia.\n\nSN AWARDS: 2025 All-America team | Player of the Year | Coach of the Year\n\nMORE: College Football Playoff first round predictions\n\nOle Miss will face No. 3 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Day in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nGeorgia has emerged as one of, if not the, best programs in college football over the past five seasons. The Bulldogs won back-to-back championships in 2021 and 2022, securing the program's first national titles since 1980. This sustained period of dominance has seen them compile an FBS-best record of 64-6 since the start of the 2021 season, making them a perennial force in the playoff conversation.\n\nIn addition to the national titles, the Bulldogs have collected three of the last four SEC Championships, winning in 2022, 2024, and 2025, most recently a dominating 28-7 victory over No. 9 Alabama. The Crimson Tide were the one team that beat the Bulldogs this season, defeating them in September. But, Georgia was dominant in all three phases en route to another conference title in Atlanta.\n\nThis year's Georgia team is as talented as any in the country. On offense, Gunner Stockton is surrounded by talented skill position players, whether Zachariah Branch, Dillon Bell, Nate Frazier, Chauncey Bowens, Oscar Delp and more. On defense, the Bulldogs did not look like a typical Kirby Smart defense — especially when rushing the passer — early in the season, but have now gone four games allowing 10 or less points. There is an argument that though Georgia is No. 3, the best team in America lies in Athens.\n\nMORE: Georgia 2025 College Football Playoff tickets guide\n\nGeorgia and Ole Miss already squared off this year, with the Bulldogs winning 43-35 in Athens. Georgia, who is known for its dominance in the final frame, rattled off 17 fourth quarter points to give the Rebels their first and only loss.\n\nAn unparalleled run of success — two national championships, three SEC titles in four years, and nearly three calendar years without a regular-season loss — firmly establishes Georgia as the premier program in the modern era, setting the standard for every other team entering the newly expanded College Football Playoff.\n\nWith a head coach only in his second game in charge, the Rebels will face off against a program that everyone strives to be on New Years day. The No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs, the closest thing college football has to a dynasty, are awaiting their Lane Kiffin-less opponent in the Sugar Bowl Quarterfinal.\n\nRanking every Heisman winner from 200 to now\n\nFull list of college football's 2025 award winners\n\nTracking QB moves in the college football transfer portal",

    "description": "Trinidad Chabliss and Mississippi have aced their first test without former coach Lane Kiffin. The sixth-ranked Rebels beat No. 17 Tulane 41-10 on Saturday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.",
    "fullText": "OXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Trinidad Chambliss ran for two touchdowns and passed for another, and No. 6 Mississippi looked unfazed by the defection of coach Lane Kiffin, beating No. 17 Tulane 41-10 on Saturday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.\n\nScoring runs of 20 yards by Kewan Lacy and 4 yards by Chambliss gave Ole Miss (12-1) a 14-0 lead before eight minutes had elapsed in the coaching debut of Pete Golding, who was promoted from defensive coordinator after Kiffin left for LSU on Nov. 30.\n\nNext up for Golding and Ole Miss: a CFP quarterfinal against No. 2 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1\n\nTulane (11-3) and quarterback Jake Retzlaff moved the ball effectively at times, but the Rebels — who beat the Green Wave 45-10 on Sept. 20 — remained comfortably ahead throughout. Cornerback Jaylon Braxton had an early interception, and the Rebels’ defense had multiple fumble recoveries and fourth-down stops.\n\nWhile Kiffin had asked to keep coaching Ole Miss through the playoff even while working for its Southeastern Conference rival, athletic director Keith Carter would not allow it. So the Rebels entered arguably the most significant game ever played at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium with a new coach — not to mention an unprecedented level of looming staff and roster uncertainty for a team contending for a national title.\n\nIn Mississippi’s famed Grove, artwork around tailgate tents depicted Kiffin in a negative light, including one showing him on a Christmas “naughty” list, with Golding in the “nice” column.\n\nWhen Golding walked onto the field during warm-ups, the crowd roared. Fans continued cheering as Eli Manning, a former Ole Miss QB and two-time Super Bowl winner with the New York Giants, greeted the new Rebels coach on the sideline.\n\nOn the opposite sideline was Tulane coach Jon Sumrall, who was permitted to keep coaching the Green Wave after being hired by Florida. His hopes of returning to Tulane’s home city of New Orleans to prepare for the Sugar Bowl were dashed, and he’ll be packing up for Gainesville, Florida, to join the Gators.\n\nChambliss, who briefly left the game late in the first half after a big hit during an 11-yard scramble, finished with 282 yards passing. Lacy rushed for 87 yards before heading to the locker room in the fourth quarter with an apparent left shoulder injury. De’Zhaun Stribling caught five passes for 79 yards, including a 13-yard TD.\n\nLSU transfer Logan Diggs added a 3-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.\n\nRetzlaff finished with 306 yards passing and a TD for Tulane, whose loss dropped non-power conference teams to 0-3 in CFP games (with James Madison playing at Oregon later Saturday night). Jamauri McClure gained 84 yards on 15 carries.\n\nTulane: The Green Wave could not afford a poor start on defense and got exactly that as the Rebels scored two TDs on their first seven offensive plays. As in the teams’ first meeting, Tulane moved the ball in spurts, finishing with 421 yards, but could sustain drives long enough to score.\n\nOle Miss: Kiffin’s absence didn’t inhibit the Rebels’ explosiveness on offense — at least not against a team from a non-power conference. The Rebels finished 497 yards of total offense, including four plays that went for 25 yards or more.",

    "title": "I was over 300 pounds in high school. Then, college life pushed me to lose over a third of my body weight.",
    "description": "I felt ashamed for being overweight in high school, so I stayed consistent with a healthy diet in college. That practice made me a better student.",
    "fullText": "The menus hadn't even closed before I blurted out my order: a salad. It was my way of throwing my friends off the scent, as if a plate of lettuce could erase the truth and hide my late-night snack binging. But deep down, I knew the only person I was fooling was myself.\n\nAt 16, about 4 years ago, standing at 5'9\" and 120 pounds overweight, I felt powerless — not just over my body, but over the insecurities that dictated how I moved through the world.\n\nWeighing over 300 pounds was the elephant in every room I walked into, and most days I felt like the elephant myself. I vividly remember sitting in doctors' offices and being told my BMI was too high, but every time their words felt clinical and detached. What I felt each day was far more immediate, as every choice I made revolved around trying to shrink: grabbing something small at restaurants, ducking out of photos, hesitating to speak up in class for fear of drawing attention.\n\nI was exhausted, yet trying to change felt even more overwhelming. I hoped everything would be different in college.\n\nWhen I arrived at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, the thought of starting fresh collided with the reality that I was still carrying the same weight, physically and emotionally.\n\nWatching everyone else carve out their independence made me realize that if I wanted to take advantage of this new beginning, I couldn't keep living in the shadow of my body insecurities. That recognition, that no one could make this change for me, was the first real decision I ever made on my own.\n\nThe process was messy. I researched and experimented, failed and adjusted, over and over again. I cut out seconds, swapped soda for water, and reminded myself that a slice of cake today would not help me tomorrow.\n\nAt first, it felt impossible. I failed often, sometimes in secret, but each time that I pulled myself back on track, I chipped away at the belief that I was incapable of discipline.\n\nAt first, the changes felt so small they seemed pointless, but gradually I noticed patterns forming. My cravings dulled, my routines steadied, and I began to trust myself in situations that once felt impossible.\n\nI came to understand that progress was not a straight line; it curved, dipped, and sometimes reversed. The true test was whether I could keep going even when no one else was forcing me to.\n\nSuccess didn't come as dramatic numbers on a scale but in quieter victories: having the energy to walk across campus without losing my breath, joining a conversation instead of hanging back, and looking in the mirror without immediately turning away.\n\nThe discipline and resilience I built through that journey have carried into every corner of my college life. Balancing coursework, adjusting to independence, and navigating friendships all required the same patience and persistence I first practiced at the table.\n\nI approached long nights of studying the way I approached exercise: one choice at a time, knowing consistency mattered more than perfection. I learned to prioritize my well-being, to recognize when to push forward and when to rest, and to trust that even when progress didn't look linear, it was still happening.\n\nWith the past in the rearview mirror, the desire for change and knowledge feeds my hunger that was once covered up by sweets and treats. My curiosity for more only grew.\n\nThe skills I have obtained before and during my transformation have taught me to believe that change is good. It pushes you to grow into the person you are meant to be. The hardships, growth, and setbacks have helped build my mindset to continue pushing myself.",

    "description": "Linda Martindale, a boys high school coach, mental fitness expert and mom to collegiate players, says college athletes have this special ingredient.",
    "fullText": "Linda Martindale wasn’t brave, at least she didn’t think she was after she had been hired as a varsity boys basketball coach.\n\n“Once the game started, I was fine,” says Martindale, now in her sixth season leading Lincoln-Sudbury (MA), “but walking into the gym and people thinking I'm the scorekeeper or whatever, I had to sort of overcome this feeling of, ‘Do I belong in the gym?’ ”\n\nShe made the three words her mantra, and she convinced herself she was brave. You need to be as an athlete, or a coach, in today’s world of youth sports.\n\n“I have fond memories of my athletic career, but I also know there was a lot of heartache and it was very difficult,” says Martindale, who played Division II basketball at Alaska-Anchorage and in the old Pac-10 at Arizona in the late 1980s and early 1990s. “But nowadays, it's totally different. Your whole career is splashed all over social media.”\n\nMartindale’s father devoted his life to coaching baseball and football, driving her and her three siblings to be punctual and polite. He was hard on them, she says, but led with love.\n\n“If I had a bad game, the people in the stands knew and my parents knew, and that was it,” Martindale tells USA TODAY Sports. “You'd come home and your parents would say, ‘How did the game go?' You could self-report that. Easy to deal with.\n\n“My oldest son would literally get DMs from strangers that say horrible things if he missed a free throw in the clutch. The landscape is very different. And it obviously trickles down to youth.”\n\nMartindale got certified as a mental fitness coach to help ease the pressure on her three sons and one daughter (all of them have played college sports) but also other young athletes.\n\nShe works with sports teams at Division I Holy Cross and D-III Curry College, as well as individual athletes. She says there’s a secret beyond the physical component to playing sports in college.\n\nWe offer 10 ways, through consultation with Martindale, for parents to help athletes get there.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nWhen Martindale walked into the gym feeling the male eyes on her, she felt she needed an inner coach.\n\nYour coach on the court or field will tell you what to do but, Martindale says, the one in your head will kick you in the butt to help get you where you need to go.\n\nJenny Levy, who has won four national titles as North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, believes so strongly in an inner coach she likes when her players form their own mantras.\n\n“Confidence looks good on you,” she heard her players say to each other in 2013, the year they broke through.\n\n“A lot of coaches will say, ‘This is our saying,’ ” Levy told Martindale on Martindale’s ‘Game Changers’ podcast. “And I think that’s fine – to each his own – but I actually let our team organically come up with their own little things. This is the team having a good time together.”\n\nThe inner voice tells you it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, only what you do.\n\nTo come up with your own mantra, Martindale says, ask yourself why you play a sport? Look for performance cues to grind that thought into you.\n\n“It's not fun to lose, but it's still really fun to compete and to play,” Martindale says. “OK, good, let's start with that. So at least you can say it's not fun to lose, but it's really fun to prepare for the game. We've now established that the majority of the time is fun. Now we can get through the parts that aren't fun.”\n\nWas that ‘fun’? How Coco Gauff’s tough US Open embodies what the word means\n\nKids respond to the truth. We don’t need to always sugarcoat it.\n\nInstead of saying, “It’s not so hard,” acknowledge that something is.\n\nMaybe you’re afraid that you might lose or you’re going to make a fool of yourself in front of everybody.\n\n“I'm happy that you can articulate a fear,” Martindale might tell an athlete. “Now, let's squash it. What are you really afraid of? Is it really embarrassing to lose, or is it embarrassing not to play at all?\n\n“It would be embarrassing if you threw yourself on the floor and screamed and cried in the middle of the game. But nobody thinks it's embarrassing that you sat on the bench, cheered on your team, and then fought another day to try to get some minutes.”\n\nA current role doesn’t mean an ultimate role. Martindale goes back to Tom Brady.\n\nHe was once buried deep on Michigan’s depth chart. But he focused on nailing reps he got in practice. He was at game speed when he found himself starting.\n\n“As parents, we say, ‘I don't think you should have to be the backup quarterback,' \" Martindale says. “ 'I think you should be the quarterback.’ This is not helping. What you need to do is crush being the backup. And then your time comes and you're ready instead of spending so much time worrying that you don't have the role that you want (and) you're not ready for it.”\n\nAnother of her podcast guests, Luke Avdalovic, a former walk-on basketball player at Northern Arizona University, told her: “I had a teammate named JoJo Anderson and he told me, ‘If you want to find a role into this team, find one thing that you’re really good at. Make sure you’re head and shoulders better than every single other person on the team. Then they can’t take you off the floor.’ ”\n\nAvdalovic became a top sharpshooter who rose to the NBA G-League.\n\nAvdalovic has shot so much over the years he feels he’s never really in a slump. Some days he shoots better than others, but that is just the law of averages.\n\n“You can't be a pitcher if you can't pitch poorly,” Martindale says. “You can't be a shooter if you can't miss. It's just not possible (to) be perfect. So what do you do when you're imperfect?”\n\nThe next time your son or daughter has a bad game, ask them, “Did you compete hard?”\n\nYou don’t want them to lose or fail but they need to know how to do both. As parents, and as coaches, our best support can come out of struggles.\n\nYou know the term if you’re a baseball fan. Suddenly, Steve Sax or Chuck Knoblauch can’t make a routine throw from second to first base, or Rick Ankiel can’t throw a strike.\n\n“Yips is not a real thing,” Martindale says.\n\nStruggles come alive, she says, when we say them out loud. Instead, if you’re a parent or a coach, tell your athlete: “I really believe in you. Just keep throwing, you'll get it back, you'll find a rhythm.”\n\nWhen kids feel deep-rooted support, they have more confidence in themselves.\n\nMartindale says today’s world for young athletes is like taking the SATs while your score is being put on a scoreboard.\n\nSometimes, it seems, we expect our kids to be good at everything. Martindale asks the ones with whom she works, “What class are you good at?”\n\nShe doesn’t necessarily mean classes in which they have an “A,” but the ones they enjoy most.\n\nSometimes it takes looking at things through a less critical lens. We have an “A” in science, but we enjoy the challenge of English Lit, in which we have a B-, which energizes us to try and bring up the grade.\n\nEugene Glisky, Martindale’s father, had his ashes buried on the field where he coached near Toronto. She suspects he changed the lives of many young men.\n\nBut she stops short of calling a team a family.\n\n“When a coach says to a parent, ‘I'm gonna treat your son or daughter like my own,' I want to say, ‘No, thank you. I don't need you to treat my son like he’s your own,’ ” Martindale says. “He has a great father. What I really want you to do is treat him like a player and a human being.\n\n“It's a team, which is amazing and I love my kid being part of a team. But it's not a family. Why? Because what happens when your family cuts you?”\n\nThere are times when we need to be Coach, and times when we need to be Mom or Dad. Martindale had to be Coach when Judson, her oldest who now plays basketball for Manchester Basketball Club in the United Kingdom, came out of a game when he was younger and looked at her like, “Why are you pulling me?\n\nHe threw his water bottle, and she turned and said: \"You can take your sneakers off. You're done.\"\n\nThe same coach, though, drove him home from a different game, criticizing him for what he didn’t do while failing to realize he was sick.\n\n\"So many examples of total failure by me,\" she says. \"What kind of mother would be talking to their kid about some offensive set when clearly they needed a mother?\"\n\nLevy, North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, does parent Zoom calls. Before the first one, she asked her players what they wanted her to tell them.\n\n“They said, ‘We don’t want to talk about the game at the tailgate after,’ ” Levy told Martindale. “ ‘We don’t want any parent to have this sad conversation after the wins because their kid didn’t play. We want the parents to sit together. We want them to be positive on the sideline.’ ”\n\nLevy says the players gave her a Letterman top 10 of parent no-no’s, which she shared on the Zoom.\n\n“I think they were pretty shocked,” says Levy, who coaches her daughter, Kate, on the team. “Our kids were like, ‘Last year was not OK. This is what we want and this is what we need this year.’\n\n“And then if we saw it, I had permission from our players to call the parent and say, ‘Hey, you’re at the tailgate and your behavior was below the line for our program.’\n\n“What if I acted like that as a parent? What if I did that in the middle of a tailgate?”\n\nLevy’s point: A kid could be completely happy but if the parent is unhappy with their role, then the kid’s unhappy. And if the parent isn’t feeling like their kid is getting a fair shake, or they’re being really negative toward coaches or teammates, the kid internalizes the feeling.\n\n“Your influence is not neutral, parents,” Levy says.\n\nDuring a clip Martindale shared of her speaking to athletes, she says, “There has to be wins in there. Otherwise, you can't go an entire season and be like, ‘If we don't win a game, this whole season is a waste.’ ”\n\nShe is not necessarily talking about checks in the “W” column as much as what we perceive as personal wins. Maybe you tell a teammate you loved the way he blocked a punt or moved into position on defense. If we don’t have wins, even within losses, you don’t learn how to win.\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nMartindale believes there are five pillars of mental fitness: 1. Staying in the moment; 2. Controlling the controllables; 3. Seeing mistakes as opportunities; 4. Not judging yourself (or others) too harshly and 5. Comparison (positively).\n\nShe says she was once a failure at all of them. Has she since learned a special ingredient we need to have to play college sports?\n\nMartindale thinks Angela Duckworth, director of the Penn-Wharton Behavior Change for Good Initiative, said it best.\n\n“It’s grit,” Martindale has said. “I'm obsessed with grit, because we know it's a single defining characteristic of successful people.\n\n“Can you get up after you get knocked down? The athletes who are successful at every level of college, I think, have this kind of dog mentality that is about grit. And of course, you have to be skilled and you have to be athletic but when we really look at who performs best when it counts, it's people who have failed. Over and over and over. And then now they succeed.”\n\nWe can’t beat our kids up over mistakes. Let them hear the voice in their head that gives them the grace to move forward from them.\n\nThen, as Martindale says: “Watch them fail and then watch what they do after they fail.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999. He spent 10 years coaching his two sons’ baseball and basketball teams. He and his wife, Colleen, are now sports parents for two high schoolers.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., beating Vance by 51% to 49%.\n\nWhen broken down by demographic, Ocasio-Cortez leads Vance among Black voters (79% to 21%), Hispanic voters (64% to 36%), voters who have a college education (56% to 44%), voters aged 18 to 29 (58% to 42%), voters aged 30 to 44 (51% to 49%) and women voters (56% to 44%).\n\nVance, meanwhile, leads among white voters (57% to 43%), voters aged 65 and older (52% to 48%), voters without a college education (51% to 49%) and voters who are men (54% to 46%).\n\nBoth politicians are tied at 50% with voters aged 45 to 64, according to the poll.\n\nThe poll was conducted between Dec. 5 to Dec. 11 with a sample size of 1,521 registered voters.

Behind Newsom is former Vice President Kamala Harris with 22%, followed by former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg with 11%. Ocasio-Cortez placed behind Buttigieg with 9% support.\n\nThe poll was conducted between Dec. 11 and Dec. 15.

    "fullText": "SEC dominates Top 25 college athletic department valuation rankings originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe University of Texas athletic department has been ranked the most valuable in college sports for 2025, according to a CNBC valuation released this week. Texas’s program is estimated at $1.48 billion, a 16% increase from the prior year and enough to vault the Longhorns past leader Ohio State.\n\nOhio State which held the top spot in last year’s ranking, slipped to second despite a 2% valuation increase, landing at approximately $1.35 billion.\n\nCNBC’s reporter Michael Ozanian values the 75 most valuable college athletic programs at a combined $51.2 billion, up 13% from 2024. The surge reflects escalating revenue streams, including media rights, sponsorships and the expanding impact of name, image and likeness (NIL) deals for student-athletes.\n\nTexas A&M retains the No. 3 spot at roughly $1.32 billion, while Georgia and Michigan round out the top five, each valued at about $1.16 billion. Notre Dame is sixth at $1.13 billion, followed by Tennessee at $1.12 billion and USC at $1.10 billion. Alabama and Nebraska are also among the top 10, all topping the $1 billion threshold.\n\nOf the top 25 athletic departments, 12 programs hail from the Southeastern Conference, with multiple SEC schools valued above $1.3 billion. Oregon sit just below the billion-dollar mark, despite a lucrative tie to Nike.\n\nThe widening valuations demonstrate how the business of college sports continues to grow, fueled largely by football revenues and lucrative conference television deals. The rise of NIL compensation packages has further broadened the financial abilities of elite programs, with some universities leveraging star athletes to enhance revenue and marketability.\n\nThe annual valuation shows a shifting landscape in collegiate athletics, where financial muscle increasingly figures into competitive balance and strategic planning across the four major conferences.\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nPat McAfee delivers reality check to Diego Pavia for Heisman weekend antics\n\nFernando Mendoza won't keep the Heisman Trophy\n\nWhy LSU should be extremely nervous about Michigan firing Sherrone Moore",

    "description": "The College Football Playoff (CFP) kicks off tonight with Oklahoma vs Alabama! Here’s how you can watch each matchup, including tonight’s SEC rematch:",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoffs are finally underway this weekend, as some of the top teams in the country do battle for a shot for a national title. With three teams in the playoff, the Big Ten is well represented, but two of those three teams sit on a bye week as the top two programs in the country. One, the Oregon Ducks, play on Saturday against James Madison.\n\nHere’s how you can watch that game and the other four that take place this weekend.\n\nWeather: 49 degrees, partly cloudy\n\nThis game will wrap up the first-round slate, and Vegas really likes a landslide victory for the Ducks.\n\nBob Chesney, JMU’s head coach, is prepping to leave after this run to coach UCLA and has a foot out of the door already. While the Dukes cruised through Sun Belt play to an 11-1 record, they lost at Louisville, their only Power 4 opponent, by two touchdowns back in Week 2. Many are counting them out of this game, but they boasted both a top-10 offense and defense in the country.\n\nOregon should win this game, but if it sneaks back to 21.5 points again like it has a few times over the last few days, I’ll likely take the Dukes and the points.\n\nWeather: 65 degrees, partly cloudy\n\nAnother playoff game, another two programs who are playing with head coaching chaos. Lane Kiffin’s ugly exit with Ole Miss has already happened, while Tulane’s Jon Sumrall will head to Florida once this CFP run is over.\n\nThe Green Wave lost two games this season, including a blowout at Ole Miss in Week 4. This one goes similarly, even without Kiffin, as the Rebels are clearly the much better team.\n\nThe play: Ole Miss -17.5 (-110)\n\nWeather: 67 degrees, partly cloudy\n\nMike Elko’s Aggies were perfect through their first 11 games, but a loss at Texas in the final game of the season has brought up some questions for this team.\n\nThere is a common opponent for these two teams — Notre Dame, a team considered snubbed despite a 10-2 record. Both squads won late over the Irish by a field goal or less. Despite missing the ACC Championship, Miami was playing its best football in the final four weeks. If I was playing a side, it would likely be the Hurricanes. I think this is the best game of the weekend and I expect a shootout despite the total shrinking from 52.5 at open to 48.5. Give me the over.\n\nThe first game of the CFP is a rematch, as Oklahoma went to Tuscaloosa and beat Alabama, 23-20, earlier this season. Oklahoma was without star edge R Mason Thomas in that game, and quarterback John Mateer was battling an injury. This time around, there are some rumblings that Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson may not be fully healthy. It’s going to be a fascinating game, but I think the Crimson Tide are the better team and that they win this game.\n\nOverall record: 31-32 (-2.18 units)",

    "description": "Dillon Thieneman could be an upgrade for Cincinnati at safety.",
    "fullText": "With the College Football Playoff kicking off, here are some of the most notable NFL Draft prospects to watch for this weekend.\n\nAlabama against Oklahoma is a rematch from earlier this season. Oklahoma pulled out a close victory against the Crimson Tide 23 to 21 in that game. I expect this game to come right down to the wire once again. We have previously discussed some Alabama prospects like Kadyn Proctor, Tim Keenan III, Deontae Lawson, and Keon Sabb. The Cincinnati Bengals could be looking to add a cornerback to replace Cam Taylor-Britt going into next year. Alabama’s Domani Jackson could be a player who intrigues the Bengals. He feels like a player that could go anywhere from rounds three to five during the draft this year. While he hasn’t had the season that many expected, he is still a solid draft prospect. He is expected to run a 4.3 40-yard dash or potentially even lower. Jackson is a great athlete with return ability, an excellent run defender, and rarely misses a tackle. He has an incredible 2.6% missed tackle rate on the 2025 season.\n\nDomani Jackson (Alabama CB #1)\n-Uses his long frame to force receivers off of their route and disrupt timing of the play\n-Shows scheme flexibility and is capable in both man and zone coverage\n-Has moments where his build and toughness align effectively as a true bump and run… pic.twitter.com/CYIsf4ShLT\n\n— Owen Denny (@OwenDennyNFL) December 4, 2025\n\nOklahoma has a plethora of defensive talent that should be of interest to the Bengals. We have mentioned previously R.Mason Thomas, Robert Spears-Jennings, Kip Lewis, and Gracen Halton. Another player on that defense worth mentioning for the 2026 NFL Draft is Damonic Williams. Williams is a day three space eating defensive tackle. Williams is listed at 6’1” and 323 pounds. He does his best work as a run defender in the middle of the Sooners defense. Williams originally spent a couple of seasons playing for TCU.\n\nDamonic Williams about to wreck SEC O-Lines! 😤\n pic.twitter.com/veDDTDhX1n\n\n— The Main Line (@TheMainLinePod) May 3, 2024\n\nTexas A&M has a lot of talent in the trenches on both sides of the ball. Cashius Howell, Tyler Onyedim, and Albert Regis headline the defensive line. On the offensive line they are loaded with draft-elibile talent like Trey Zuhn III, Dametrious Crownover, Chase Bisontis, and Ar’maj Reed-Adams. If the Bengals decide to not re-sign Dalton Risner, they may look once again toward the draft for a right guard. While that isn’t a guarantee with Jalen Rivers here, it is at least worth mentioning. Reed-Adams is a right guard prospect that could come in and compete to start early. He is a mauling presence on the interior that loves to finish plays, sometimes to his own detriment with penalties. That type of nasty is something this Cincinnati team is missing.\n\nAr’maj Reed-Adams is a DAWG at Right Guard (even took some Right Tackle snaps in this one) pic.twitter.com/tmBzRySVIh\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) May 8, 2025\n\nMiami is equally as impressive on both sides of the ball in the trenches. On offense, they have Francis Mauigoa, Markel Bell, Anez Cooper, and James Brockermyer. On the defensive line they have Rueben Bain Jr., Ahmad Moten Sr., and Akheem Mesidor. Mesidor is an older prospect that will be turning 25 years old. We have seen previously with the pick of Demetrius Knight Jr., that age may not scare the Bengals off from taking an older guy on day two. Mesidor has 30 career sacks between his time at West Virginia and Miami. When healthy, he is an explosive pass rusher with a quick first step and a variety of pass rush moves in his arsenal. He has a 29.9% win rate on true pass sets during the 2025 season.\n\nAkheem Mesidor (#3) Miami vs. Notre Dame – Mesidor will turn 25 years old in April and has put up 7 sacks, 43 pressures, and 4 forced fumbles so far this season. \n\nAt 6’3” 280 pounds he offers inside and outside versatility along the defensive line. He is a high effort player,… pic.twitter.com/gZ8wqkZ7aS\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) November 26, 2025\n\nOle Miss will be entering this game without former head coach Lane Kiffin. Kiffin will not be coaching in the playoffs after taking the LSU job. Ole Miss still has a ton of talented players and should easily handle Tulane this weekend. Zxavian Harris is a big-bodied defensive tackle I have previously discussed. They also have Dae’quan Wright, Harrison Wallace III, and De’Zhaun Stribling as offensive weapons. Another player that continues to intrigue me is Suntarine Perkins. The Bengals have tried to use Demetrius Knight Jr. as a player that can come off the edge at times with limited results. While Knight did put up two sacks this week, it was while playing the role of a spy on Lamar Jackson. If they want a player with real pass rush juice from the linebacker position, Perkins may be there guy. Perkins had 10.5 sacks last season while playing more on the edge. This year, he has just two sacks but has shown that he can play more as an off-ball linebacker, which he needed to do at only 6’1” 210 pounds.\n\nOle Miss's Suntarine Perkins might be my favorite prospect I watched all summer. Can't remember someone his size (6-1, 210) playing on the line of scrimmage in a major conference and still being a difference maker. \n\nDon't care where he plays, I want him on my football team pic.twitter.com/EAjzxQJC8Q\n\n— Mike Renner (@mikerenner_) July 30, 2025\n\nFor Tulane, there really isn’t much to talk about for the draft. Quarterback Jake Retzlaff is a transfer from BYU that might get a camp invitation. He is unlikely to be on a roster in the NFL next year. The best prospect for them is defensive tackle/defensive end Santana Hopper, but it sounds like he will be entering the transfer portal and remaining in college football next year.\n\nTulane first-team all-conference DL Santana Hopper is expected to enter the transfer portal following the College Football Playoff, sources tell @On3sports. \n\nHas 13 career sacks. https://t.co/wMrfFrcNOy pic.twitter.com/rOyVZFN4v7\n\n— Pete Nakos (@PeteNakos) December 16, 2025\n\nAnother contest that is likely to be heavily one sided features Oregon taking on James Madison. Oregon has a ton of draft-eligible talent including Dante Moore (QB), Noah Whittington (RB), Kenyon Sadiq (TE), Isaiah World (OT), Alex Harkey (OT), Emmanuel Pregnon (OG), Iapani Laloulu (OC), Matayo Uiagalelei (DE), Bear Alexander (DT), A’Mauri Washington (DT), Bryce Boettcher (LB), Jadon Canady (CB), and Dillon Thieneman (S). Thieneman is the most likely player that could end up a Cincinnati Bengal. The rangy safety prospect has good straight-line speed and has been highly productive for both Purdue and Oregon during his time in college football.\n\nDillon Thieneman vs. Indiana pic.twitter.com/WEel3shdxI\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) November 20, 2025\n\nSimilar to Tulane, there really isn’t much for James Madison as far as draft prospects for this year. Wayne Knight is probably the best prospect on their team. However, the running back is listed at just 5’7”. He is listed at weighing around 190 pounds and has shown impressive contact balance. Knight has rushed for almost 1300 yards in 2025. He has also added almost 400 more yards as a receiver. Knight will have to play out of his mind against Oregon for James Madison to even keep this one close.\n\nJust incredible contact balance from James Madison’s Wayne Knight to pop through here.\n\nHe’s top three in the Sun Belt in rushing yards after contact pic.twitter.com/6IELz0SmUM\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) December 6, 2025",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nQuarterback Dylan Raiola continues to be a hot-buttoned topic around the college football community, especially given his reported decision to enter the transfer portal.\n\nTeams have started to emerge as possible new spots for Raiola, but according to ESPN's Greg McElroy, one of them seems like an easy choice.\n\n\"If Dante Moore does decide to go to the NFL, well then, the Oregon Ducks offer a place that could be a perfect landing spot,\" McElroy said on \"Always College Football.\"\n\nBut it's much bigger.

He’s good on the edge. He’s fast. He’s played inside a little bit. He’s played on the edge.”\n\nGainer recorded 27 tackles and 2.5 sacks in his one season at UNC. He finished his college career with 237 total tackles.\n\n“He played inside at Florida State, if I remember, in college,” Maye said. “He moved to the edge once he got to North Carolina. So, I know he was with Vegas, and it’s good to see him back. I think everybody’s just trying to see what they can do just to help us, whether it’s on game day, throughout practice or whatever he can do.”\n\nGainer appeared in 17 games as a rookie with the Las Vegas Raiders, playing mostly in a special teams capacity. The 25-year-old provides good size to the practice squad and a great motor, according to Maye.\n\n“I know he’s going to work hard, and I know he’s got a good work ethic,” Maye said.\n\nMike Vrabel-Bashing Radio Host Shreds Patriots Coach Amid Josh McDaniels Debate",

    "fullText": "After a whole month of controversy with former head coach Lane Kiffin, the Ole Miss Rebels are finally back on the playing field, hoping to continue the best season in program history.\n\nThey face a familiar matchup this weekend against a Tulane team that they blew out 45-10 earlier this year, and should cruise through their first round College Football Playoff game on Saturday.\n\nThey’re a significant favorite and deservedly so. They outgained the Green Wave by nearly 250 yards in the first matchup, while completely shutting down their passing attack. Offensively, Trinidad Chambliss and Co. were dominant, throwing for over 300 yards while getting 241 more on the ground.\n\nOle Miss scored on eight of its first nine possessions, and Tulane just had no answers defensively. But, the blowout win did show a glaring concern: Ole Miss’s run defense.\n\nThe Rebels could not contain the Tulane ground game, as the Green Wave went for 178 yards on 4.6 yards per carry. And that wasn’t a one-game problem.\n\nAfter being a dominant force up front in 2024, ranking first in rushing yards allowed per game (85.1) and in yards allowed per carry (2.4), Ole Miss has significantly slipped this season. They rank 71st in rushing yards allowed per game (157.1), while being 92nd in yards allowed per carry (4.7).\n\nNow, the issue hasn’t shown up as much this year because Ole Miss’s offense has been elite, and the pass defense has been a top-30 unit in the country this year.\n\nBut, in Ole Miss’s close games this season, they struggled to defend the run. Against Kentucky early in the year, they allowed 172 rushing yards and 4.6 yards per carry. Arkansas went for 221 yards and four scores on six yards per carry in Ole Miss’s 41-35 win. Washington State had 127 yards on 4.5 yards a carry. Oklahoma went for 136 yards and two scores on nearly five yards a carry.\n\nThen, there’s Georgia, who went for 221 yards and a touchdown on the ground in Ole Miss’s lone loss of the year. And that’s who the Rebels will play in the second round of the Playoff, assuming they beat Tulane.\n\nNow, the Rebels are still a stellar 11-1 in the SEC. They’ve managed to win behind that elite defense and good pass defense. And they should run through Tulane this weekend, whose defense can’t keep up with Ole Miss.\n\nBut, if there’s a reason why Ole Miss’s magical season might end earlier than fans hope, it’s the run defense, which can certainly be a prevalent issue against the top teams in the country.",

    "title": "Starbucks is doubling down on its free bachelor's degree program as enrollment surges 60%",
    "description": "Starbucks' Chief People Officer Sara Kelly spoke to Business Insider about the company's increasingly popular free college program.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks receives more than a million job applications a year, the company's Chief People Officer says one reason is a quietly powerful lure: the promise of a fully-funded bachelor's degree from Arizona State University.\n\nFor Brea Yancey, a barista in Washington state who has worked at the company for eight years, that benefit hasn't just reshaped her future — it reshaped her family's. She enrolled, then inspired her mother, a Starbucks store manager, to join her, turning a workplace perk into a two-generation push toward a goal neither woman thought was financially in reach.\n\n\"I didn't think college was going to be an option because of how much it costs with loans and things like that,\" Yancey, who celebrated her graduation on Monday, told Business Insider. \"I know it's going to make all the difference in the world not having to worry about that.\"\n\nYancey pursued a degree in interdisciplinary arts and performance, with the goal of becoming a music teacher. Her mother graduated last semester with a degree in interdisciplinary studies, concentrating in sales, marketing, and project management.\n\n\"I'm glad that she got to finish school, because that's all she ever wanted, and she stopped originally because she got pregnant with me, but now we finished it together,\" Yancey said.\n\nAs college costs have soared, so has enrollment in Starbucks' College Achievement Plan (SCAP) program, Chief People Officer Sara Kelly told Business Insider. The program, which began in 2014, offers eligible employees 100% upfront tuition coverage for their first bachelor's degree, facilitated through online classes at ASU.\n\n\"Over the last five years, we've seen a 60% increase in participation,\" Kelly said. \"We have 13% of our partners participating as scholars today.\"\n\nThat represents at least one enrolled Starbucks staff member at about 90% of its coffeehouses, Kelly added.\n\nStarbucks isn't the only retail or Fortune 500 employer offering education benefits. Amazon, Walmart, and Chipotle also offer similar programs. However, compared to most programs in the US retail sector, Starbucks doesn't require reimbursement of tuition payments or require students to stay with the company for a certain amount of time after graduation.\n\nYounger students are increasingly questioning the value of a college degree. A May 2024 Deloitte survey found that a third of Gen Z and millennials chose to skip higher education due to rising costs, and the average price of attendance for a student living on campus at an in-state public 4-year institution is $108,584 over 4 years, according to Educationdata — so you can't beat free.\n\n\"This started over 10 years ago, all in service of creating access to education, and the importance of creating access to education,\" Kelly said. \"College is incredibly costly, and so how do we create access to that education for all of our partners? So we're really proud, because we see this as one of the most powerful expressions of our investment in our partners.\"\n\nStarbucks has expanded the SCAP program in recent years, offering access to more than 150 degree pathways, providing enrolled students with a broader range of fields to pursue than in the program's early years. They've also added a \"Pathway to Admission\" support route for partners who don't initially qualify for university admission, allowing them to take preparatory courses and earn their way into ASU. Additionally, a \"plus-one\" benefit is available for eligible military and veteran partners, extending SCAP to a qualifying family member.\n\nThis year, Starbucks introduced new study abroad and coffee education opportunities, offering a hands-on sustainability immersion at Hacienda Alsacia in Costa Rica, where scholars study climate, agronomy, and the future of coffee at their global research and development farm.\n\nOf course, the students aren't the only ones benefiting. The program is a significant retention win for Starbucks. Turnover is at record lows, Kelly said, and baristas who have spoken to Business Insider frequently cite the SCAP program as a reason they've stayed with the company.\n\nThe program also helps to strengthen Starbucks' talent pipeline, as the company has committed to a 90% internal hire rate or fill rate for its retail leadership roles.\n\n\"Our Starbucks college achievement plan partners are part of our pipeline for those management roles, and we're very excited about that,\" Kelly said. \"But do they have to stay with Starbucks? No.\"\n\nStarbucks has never considered adding a retention requirement to the program, Kelly said, because the company wants \"to offer access to education that people can take with them on their journey, no matter where it takes them.\"\n\nFor Yancey, her Starbucks journey is winding down, but it's not over. She continues to work part-time as a barista and has a second job as a music instructor, while planning her next career moves.\n\n\"They find a way to make it work for whoever wants to go into the university through the SCAP program; they find a way for you to complete it,\" Yancey said. \"I don't think finances or learning ability should hold anybody back, and they really delivered on that.\"",

    "fullText": "Two years after the Supreme Court effectively ended race-conscious college admissions nationwide, Johns Hopkins University has seen a significant change in the racial makeup of its freshman class, according to newly released enrollment data.\n\nSince 2023, the number of Asian first-year undergraduate students, as measured by federal reporting standards, has risen nearly 20 percentage points, to 45.1% from 25.6%. Black first-year student representation, meanwhile, has been cut in half, dropping to 4% from 9.8%, as has the Hispanic student population, which fell to 10.1% this year from 20.8% two years ago. White freshman enrollment remained relatively flat, at 21% in 2025, compared with 19.3% in 2023. Those self-reporting as white fell more sharply to 30.9% from 39.1%.\n\nThe data offer a clear, local snapshot of how elite universities may be changing in the wake of the 2023 ruling, which prohibited schools from considering race in admissions. While universities across the country warned the decision could reduce racial diversity, Johns Hopkins’ numbers show an especially stark shift.\n\n“Since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in [Students for Fair Admissions] v Harvard, we have been navigating an evolving legal and regulatory environment,” said university spokesman J.B. Bird in an email to the Baltimore Sun. “We continue to work on opening our doors as wide as possible to students from all backgrounds and perspectives.”\n\nThe research university has seen some success in its efforts to diversify by income level, regardless of race. The 2025 freshman class has the highest-ever number of Pell grant recipients, at 24.1%, up slightly from 23.8% last year and 21.6% the year before. First-generation college student admission remained flat from last year at 20.3% percent, but up from 19.4% in 2023. Both Pell grant recipients and first-generation college students had risen steadily since 2010.\n\nThe university’s new Tuition Promise program could also increase diversity in the coming years, said Amelia, a second-year graduate student who declined to give her last name.\n\nThe program, which begins next year, with January admissions, offers a free education to students whose families earn less than $200,000, and includes living expenses for those making less than $100,000.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision is already changing higher education in more ways than student body demographics can reveal, said Bryan Cook higher education policy director of the nonpartisan Urban Institute think tank. Johns Hopkins is not unique, though the court’s decision more strongly impacted private, elite college and universities that had been trying to recruit more diverse student bodies, Cook said. Schools like community colleges that accept all applications, and state schools that rely primarily on test scores for admissions, would not be affected, he said.\n\nA lot of institutions are having to make significant changes in their policies,” Cook said. “In many cases, this is already changing the demographics of what campuses look like.”\n\nIt’s difficult to determine the whole story, he said, admissions data only shows part of what is happening.\n\n“We know nothing about the demographics of their applicant pool and how that might line up with admissions,” Cook explained. “We don’t know what’s happening universally across all schools.”\n\nThe Urban Institute reached out to universities to request applicant data to improve their understanding, publishing their findings in July of 2025.\n\n“Early analysis from 18 institutions suggests that Black students’ share of the applicant pool increased more between 2023 and 2024 than in any of the prior five years,” the report states, “but their share of the admitted student pool held constant or even decreased. Furthermore, an increasing number of applicants have chosen not to disclose their race or ethnicity.”\n\nAmong elite universities, those admitting less than half of their applicants, Black student admissions fell to 5.9% in 2024 from 6.6% in 2023, while Black admissions at less selective schools remained level.\n\nMost Americans support fair admissions, said Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, the organization that brought the lawsuit against Harvard, resulting in the Supreme Court decision.\n\n“Credible polling from across the political spectrum indicates that Americans agree that a student’s race or ethnicity should not be considered as a factor in whether that student is accepted or rejected at any university,” Blum said.\n\nHopkins student Aaden, who asked to only be identified by his first name.\n\n“I believe it is important to have a diverse student body,” said Aaden, a third-year chemistry student, “although I think if we were picking people because of their race, it’s not fair to Asian and white students. People with lower grades might be picked because of their race.”\n\nAaden lives in Florida, where his parents immigrated from the Caribbean. He said he hasn’t experienced racism on campus but understands how new Black and Hispanic students might feel more isolated this year.\n\nMaria Laskaris, a college counselor from TopTier Admissions, helps students prepare for and get into schools best suited for their needs, beginning younger than high school age. She agreed that the Supreme Court ruling affects primarily highly selective private institutions, but said the changes would not necessarily change how she advises minority student clients.\n\n“I would make sure that any student I advise is aware of the landscape in which they are applying to college and various policies of the colleges they’re interested in,” she said. “It’s about how you set yourself apart. What do you bring to the table that makes you stand out from other applicants?”\n\nTricia Bishop contributed to this report.\n\nHave a news tip?

    "description": "In an era where international talent is at an all-time high, it might be hard to believe that it’s only been just over two decades since Utah’s Andrew Bogut became the first foreign-born winner of the John R. Wooden Award.",
    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it's 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nIn an era where international talent is at an all-time high, it might be hard to believe that it’s only been just over two decades since Utah’s Andrew Bogut became the first foreign-born winner of the John R. Wooden Award.\n\nBogut’s 2004-05 sophomore campaign with the Utes placed him into an exclusive club of college basketball history, as he led the program to the Sweet 16 in the years immediately after longtime head coach and program builder Rick Majerus left the program and received consensus national player of the year honors as a result.\n\nIn the Utes’ first season under Ray Giacolletti, Bogut averaged 20.5 points and 12.2 rebounds per game to lead the team to a 25-4 regular season record overall, with a 13-1 mark in Mountain West play. Bogut’s most impressive outing of the season was a 31-point, 13-rebound clinic in a 71-62 conference win over Wyoming on Valentine’s Day, where he made 11-of-16 attempts from the field.\n\nThe Utes would eventually fall to New Mexico in the 2005 Mountain West championship game, but still received a No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament as an at-large. Bogut continued his dominance in the first round of March Madness, pouring in 24 points on 9-of-13 shooting to lead Utah over a feisty No. 11 seed in UTEP before beating No. 3 seed Oklahoma in the Round of 32.\n\nIn the days after Bogut’s college career ended with a loss to Kentucky in the 2005 Sweet 16, he was awarded the Wooden Award with a decisive finish in the voting ahead of Duke’s JJ Redick and Illinois’ Dee Brown. Being from Australia, Bogut wasn’t too familiar with Coach Wooden’s legacy when he won the award but he still cherished the honor all the same.\n\n\"I'd heard the name before. College basketball isn't very big in Australia,\" Bogut told the Associated Press after winning the award in 2005. \"He's a legendary coach -- one of the best of all-time … It's very special just to have my name engraved on that trophy with the likes of Larry Bird, Michael Jordan and Tim Duncan.”\n\nBogut joined another very exclusive club in basketball history a few months later, as the Milwaukee Bucks selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. Bogut played 14 seasons in the NBA, winning a championship with the Golden State Warriors in 2015 in addition to earning third-team All-NBA honors with the Bucks in 2010.",

    "title": "Sienna Betts makes her college debut for No. 4 UCLA in 87 point blowout of Cal Poly",
    "description": "Freshman forward Sienna Betts, sister of Lauren Betts, made her long awaited debut in a historically high scoring game by the Bruins.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - No. 4 UCLA had by far their best scoring game of the season Tuesday night when they took to the court against the Cal Poly Mustangs and turned in one of their best defensive performances too, finishing the game with a massive 115-28 final score in favor of the Bruins.\n\nIt was UCLA's first triple digit finish of the season and the 87 point margin of victory was the fourth-largest in program history and the largest in the NCAA era.\n\nWhat made the Bruins eclipsing the 100-point threshold that much more impactful was the player who did it. With just under seven minutes to go, freshman forward Sienna Betts spun, stepped back and sank a midrange shot for her fifth point of the game and UCLA's 101st.\n\nBetts, the younger sister of superstar UCLA senior center Lauren Betts, made her long-awaited debut Tuesday night after being kept out of the season so far with an injury. She was subbed in midway through the first quarter and Pauley Pavilion roared as over a month of anticipation was finally released.\n\nFor the Betts sisters, it was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.\n\n\"I just felt super jolly. I was just so happy to be on the court with her. She's just done a lot of work and I know that this process hasn't been easy, but just to have that moment with her, this is something that we've grown up dreaming about, so to be at this level and to be on the court with her is really amazing.\"\n\nIt's been a long road to this point for the younger Betts. Close has spoken at length this season about the drive that Betts has and the disappointment that Betts has felt not being able to be on the court. Still just a freshman, that intense drive can be a spark plug for success, but it can also be straining mentally. Close has made it an important mission to guide Betts through that, and reminding her not only of her talent, but of her value both as a person and a player.\n\n\"I know who Sienna Betts is and I know how good she's going to be,\" head coach Cori Close said at halftime. \"I just want her to give herself some grace right now. She's trying to do everything all at once. She has done a heck of a job in how she's returned to play, what's she's been learning... how she will continue to improve even though it's not the way she wanted too or planned.\"\n\nNow that her first game is behind her, one of two things can happen for Betts. Either the pressure is off her shoulders and she can simply focus on moving forward, or the liklier option, she'll ramp up the intensity as much as she can now that she's got a taste of college ball.\n\n\"Sometimes an overused strength becomes a weakness. And her strength is  she demands a very high level of herself all the time. But, when you over use that or it gets out of balance it can also hold you back. So, I'm encouraging her to think about process, encouraging her to write down all of the things she did well... She made so many maturation steps over this last six or seven weeks. It's hard. If it was easy everyone would do it.\"",

    "title": "College Football Playoff picks, predictions for 2025-2026 bracket: Who will win it all?",
    "description": "There was no shortage of drama this college football season, but how will it close out and who will hoist the championship trophy? Our experts give their picks.",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff has finally arrived — games were played, decisions were made and controversy reigned once again.\n\nThere was no shortage of drama this college football season. With the precipitous falloff of teams like Penn State, Clemson and LSU, the door was opened for newcomers like Tulane, James Madison and punchy little upstart Alabama.\n\nThe most controversial decision the CFP committee made was placing three-loss Alabama and two-loss Miami into the field and leaving Notre Dame out. That's despite the Tide getting shellshocked in the SEC title game and the Hurricanes being ranked behind the Irish since the very first set of rankings came out.\n\nBut alas, the CFP bracket is set, and 12 teams remain. Who will win it all?\n\nOur team of college football experts breaks it all down with their picks for every playoff game. Feel free to disagree, or to make your own picks in the comments below.\n\nA year ago, we saw Ohio State lose its final game before the playoff and then run through the field in one of the greatest postseason winning streaks in the history of the sport. This year, the Buckeyes lost to Indiana in the Big Ten championship game — a defeat that we believe will launch Ryan Day and Co. into another postseason run.\n\nThe Buckeyes are just too talented and playing too good of defense not to run through this field. That pick shouldn't surprise you, but how about my pick for runner-up: the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Tech's front seven is good enough to knock off Big Ten foes Oregon and Indiana and advance to the title bout.\n\nThings got tough for me in the semifinal round. The first two rounds are pretty straightforward. Alabama over Oklahoma was nearly a coin flip, but it feels like Oklahoma's luck is going to run out with an offense that needs to be better. I think Miami has enough to take down Texas A&M, even with new Kansas State coach Collin Klein still calling plays for the Aggies.\n\nAll four top seeds should win in the quarterfinals. The closest game could be the rematch between Ole Miss and Georgia. In the semifinals ... I went back and forth a lot. I think each of the top four seeds is more than capable of winning the national title. Texas Tech upsetting Indiana isn't a statement against the Hoosiers. I have no doubts about how good they are. I just wonder if the loss of Stephen Daley will loom large at some point in the playoff.\n\nOhio State vs. Georgia could be the game of the year and I'm not going to be surprised if it comes down to a late field goal once again. In the title game, I have to go with the Buckeyes over the Red Raiders. Tech's defense has been so, so good at forcing turnovers. But Ohio State's ability to protect the football — the Buckeyes have just nine turnovers in 13 games — will be the difference.\n\nWith the amount of time teams have to prepare, the first round of the playoff should go according to form with home teams holding serve. The one possible exception could be in Norman, where Oklahoma has to beat Alabama for a second time this season to advance. Asking any team to beat a quality opponent twice in a row is difficult in college football, but Alabama's specific weakness — running the football — plays into the hands of Oklahoma's defense to such a degree that the Sooners have a real edge in the matchup.\n\nI also expect to see a reversal from last year, where the four teams that got byes into the quarterfinal all lost. If you talk to enough coaches, they would rather have the extra week of rest over playing a first-round game, so this trend should start to even out soon. A lot of people will pick Oregon to beat Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl, but that defense is going to present real problems for the Ducks. It's hard to envision another Georgia quarterfinal exit given the way they played down the stretch, and both Indiana and Ohio State have taken care of business all season against lesser teams.\n\nIf we get semifinal matchups with Georgia vs. Ohio State and Texas Tech vs. Indiana, we should all feel very lucky because that lineup would truly reflect the four most dominant teams of the year in college football. From there, it would be anybody's ballgame in terms of making the national championship.\n\nIt’s not how you start, it’s how you finish. And throughout this year, nobody has been better at finishing moves than Georgia. The Bulldogs turn boa constrictor in the second half of their games, encircling opponents and then smothering them. They’ll pull the same move in the playoffs, letting Indiana, Ohio State and Oregon get the early acclaim and then suffocating them deep in January. Georgia is ragged, Georgia has exploitable holes, but Georgia’s defense is like the sunset, inevitable and everywhere.\n\nThe playoff gives teams a chance to right wrongs from the regular season, and both Alabama and Oregon will take advantage. Alabama will look like a decent team against Oklahoma, and then validate everyone’s belief in their playoff unworthiness by getting waxed by Indiana.\n\nOregon will have little trouble with JMU and will overcome Texas Tech in the great Booster Battle, and will avenge a regular-season loss to Indiana in the semis.\n\nOhio State vs. Georgia will be the best game of the playoffs; it’s just the Buckeyes’ bad fortune to (again) meet the Dawgs in the semis rather than the finals.\n\nOf course, if my preseason predictions are any indication — I had Texas over Penn State in the title game — I would not recommend wagering any of your actual money on these picks. You’d be better off wagering on Notre Dame to win.\n\nAlabama is the first three-loss team to earn an at-large bid to the CFP. The Crimson Tide won’t let the opportunity go to waste. They’ll avenge their Nov. 15 loss to Oklahoma. If Ty Simpson can protect the ball and reestablish a rhythm, Alabama can dig Oklahoma a hole that it won’t be able to climb out of. The Sooners are averaging just 2.9 yards per carry over their past three games, and quarterback John Mateer — seemingly still affected by his early-season hand injury — has completed just 43.4% of his passes traveling 10-plus air yards in 2025, per PFF.\n\nMiami and Texas A&M will put on the best show of the opening round. The Hurricanes will have chances for big plays. The Aggies’ aggressive defense allowed touchdowns of 50 and 80 yards against South Carolina on Nov. 15 and touchdowns of 29 and 35 yards in the second half of its loss to Texas on Nov. 28. That’s music to the ears of do-it-all wide receiver Malachi Toney and quarterback Carson Beck, who has thrown only one pick in his past four games.\n\nOregon won’t have too much trouble against a pesky James Madison squad, but it will get a glimpse of what’s to come when it faces Sahir West, who stacked three sacks in the Sun Belt title game. That’s because the Ducks’ quarterfinal opponent will be Texas Tech. Bolstered by an elite pairing of linebackers, namely Jacob Rodriguez, the revamped Red Raiders are third nationally with just 3.96 yards per play allowed this season. That defense will deliver when it needs to versus Oregon. Speaking of awesome defenses, Indiana has one, too. The Hoosiers will put an end to an Alabama offense that’s been increasingly one-dimensional.\n\nOle Miss is my surprise pick. Pete Golding is a stabilizing force in Oxford, and he’ll be aided by the return of soon-to-be LSU offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. The Rebels are enjoying their best season in program history, and Lane Kiffin’s departure won’t interrupt that run. Behind a persistent run game and a fun passing attack engineered by Trinidad Chambliss, Ole Miss will outscore Georgia in a rematch of the team’s Oct. 18 meeting. That said, the Rebels’ storybook season will come to a halt against Ohio State, which will snap back into form versus Texas A&M following the Buckeyes’ Big Ten championship defeat.\n\nOhio State will get another crack at Indiana. First the Hoosiers will expose Texas Tech’s red-zone issues — the Red Raiders are a ghastly 101st nationally in touchdown percentage (56.2%) down there — thanks to a Bryant Haines defense that’s tied for fourth in sacks and ranks second in tackles for loss. Indiana got after Julian Sayin and confused him by disguising coverages. The Buckeyes will have a better plan this time around during a week that won’t involve a signing day scare and offensive coordinator Brian Hartline being named USF’s head coach. Ohio State was held to 10 points against Michigan last year before exploding offensively in the CFP. With star receivers Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate, there’s a good chance that happens again. Fernando Mendoza will win the Heisman, but Sayin will win the national title.",

    "description": "I'm trying to let my teen take the driver's seat as they apply to college. We only discuss college during designated times, and it's been challenging.",
    "fullText": "My fifth and final kid is a senior in high school, which means it's time for graduation, award nights, and most importantly, the college application process.\n\nAt a recent college night presentation, I met with a high school counselor. They gave all parents a startling message: You're not in the driver's seat during the application process. You're not even in the passenger seat. You're in the back seat.\n\nI took the counselor's advice and decided to step back, letting my teen take the lead as they apply to colleges. At times, this has been tough, but I keep reminding myself that this is their journey.\n\nThe post-secondary counselor talked with my child about their academic profile, major, and what they were looking for in a college. They discussed that even though my child has the background to get into highly selective (and very expensive) schools, they want to be a high school teacher, so it's not really necessary.\n\nTalking about money with kids is never fun. College is the most fraught money conversation we've had with our kids.\n\nIt was helpful to have another trusted adult discuss my child's preferences with them and help them figure out what matters most when selecting schools. Thankfully, I didn't have to be the one who directed them away from prestigious schools.\n\nI only stepped in to tell my kid how much I could afford on tuition.\n\nRather than continually nagging my kid about applications and to-do lists, I send out meeting invites to complete specific tasks, such as the FAFSA, campus visits, and scholarships.\n\nDuring these scheduled times, we sit at the kitchen table while my kid does the work. I'm available if they need me to complete forms or determine a suitable time for a campus visit.\n\nI then don't bring up college unless they do outside these scheduled times. This is hard. I'm curious to know what they're thinking and if everything is getting done. However, since we started scheduling times, my child is now proactively chatting instead of us having to ask.\n\nThe college application process teaches, sometimes the hard way, the importance of deadlines. Colleges have limits — a limited amount of scholarship money, a max on people admitted, a finite number of rooms in the best dorm — and waiting until or missing the deadline means you miss out.\n\nMy child lost out on presidential scholarships for one of their top schools because they were working to a deadline. The scholarship application process required a two-day in-person interview, and they discovered this the day before the application was due.\n\nWe couldn't make the in-person interview time, so they were unable to apply. It was frustrating, but, it was a lesson learned.\n\nWhen this presidential scholarship mishap happened, I realized how I could be helpful. I created a spreadsheet to compare schools and provide a quick view of deadlines for applications and scholarships.\n\nI'm not going into the Common App or looking over my kids' shoulders as they fill out applications. We review the spreadsheet during our college task meetings, and they get to work.\n\nI then do my best not to look at it, ask them questions, or nag them the rest of the week.\n\nI realized the best way I can stay involved is by celebrating my kids' wins.\n\nI take pictures on tours, read the brochures, and check out the acceptance packet swag. It's an exciting time for both of us, and this helps me feel more involved.\n\nEvery scholarship, every acceptance, regardless of amount or whether they choose that school, is a win and a testament to all we've both done to get to that point.",

    "fullText": "Now that the 2025 college football regular season is over, we are going to continue to hear about postseason awards and various All-American teams. One of the biggest of those is the Associated Press All-American team, and we saw that announced on Monday, with a lot of Ohio State players involved.\n\nIn total, eight Buckeyes were named across the three teams, with four of those keeping their hope alive in becoming consensus first-team All-Americans. Safety Caleb Downs, defensive tackle Kayden McDonald, linebacker Arvell Reese, and wide receiver Jeremiah Smith were all named to the first team, with all four already being named to the Walter Camp First-Team as well.\n\nBut that wasn't all, because four more Ohio State players appeared on other teams, with linebacker Sonny Styles and wide receiver Carnell Tate being named second-team All-Americans by the Associated Press, while defensive end Caden Curry and quarterback Julian Sayin appeared on the third team.\n\nSmith, widely known as the best receiver in the game, was snubbed for the Biletnikoff Award on Friday. He's caught 80 passes for 1,086 yards and 11 touchdowns. You can bet that he'll make more All-American lists going forward. Smith has had back-to-back 1,000-yard receiving seasons and still has his junior year to go.McDonald has flashed on the scene this year in the middle of the defensive line and is a potential first-round NFL draft pick come April. He clogs up the middle and has tallied 57 tackles with eight tackles for loss and three sacks.\n\nReese has also come out of nowhere to be considered one of the best linebackers in the country and also a potential first-round NFL draft pick. He has been used all over the field because of his ability to run and react to plays at several levels. He's had 62 tackles with ten tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks.Need a news break? Downs has already taken home the Jim Thorpe Award and is considered by many as the best defensive player in the game, though he did not win the Bednarik Award. Like Reese, he is one of the linchpins of the defense, often lining up at all three levels. He has registered 60 total tackles with five tackles for loss, two interceptions, and a sack so far this year.\n\n🥇Team AP All-Americans 🇺🇸 \n\n🏅 @caleb_downs2 \n🏅 @Jermiah_Smith1 \n🏅 @arvxll \n🏅 @KMac_DT pic.twitter.com/gpQQxNAAOb\n\n— Ohio State Football (@OhioStateFB) December 15, 2025\n\nThe announcement of All-American teams will continue on Tuesday when the AFCA team will be announced.

    "fullText": "The second weekend of December provided us with one of the best two-day stretches of the young 2025-26 men’s college basketball season so far.\n\nHere are the 10 teams that got the biggest boosts from the mid-December madness that just transpired.\n\nThe Johnnies had no problem with Iona in a 91-64 win that had special meaning to head coach Rick Pitino. After being essentially exiled from the sport following his dismissal at Louisville, Pitino was thrown a lifeline by Iona in 2021, and then led the Gaels to two NCAA Tournament appearances in three seasons.\n\n“Iona’s got a really good team,” Pitino said after the game. “Iona’s such a special place with great tradition. I owe them so much. We’re going to play this game every year that I’m the coach.”\n\nThe Buckeyes avoided what would have been a big hit to their early NCAA Tournament resume by roaring back from a 16-point second half deficit (regardless of what the tweet below says) and taking down West Virginia in double overtime.\n\nThese are the types of games and moments that are easy to gloss over in the dead of December, but often ultimately decide the last teams in or out of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nConference realignment might have ruined the football version of “Bedlam,” but props to the basketball programs for carrying the torch.\n\nLike Ohio State, Oklahoma really needed this win to keep a “ok, not great” early season resume before diving head first into a conference play gauntlet. The Sooners exploded for 13 made three-pointers to win their fourth consecutive game over Oklahoma State.\n\nYes, Kentucky finally got a win over a team with a pulse, but perhaps more importantly, the Wildcats avoided a loss that felt like it had the potential to push Big Blue Nation over the edge.\n\nThe Wildcats had been the most disappointing team in college basketball through the season’s first six weeks. The fan base did not love the way Mark Pope handled his first real dose of adversity. A home loss to a hated rival that every member of the UK program has looked down at for the entirety of their existence would have created a blue Christmas across the Commonwealth.\n\nIn his first game back from injury, Mo Dioubate was the ultimate difference-maker for Kentucky. The power forward transfer from Alabama scored 14 points and pulled down a season-high 12 rebounds in his first game action since Nov. 13. That’s a huge boost for a team that was in desperate need of one.\n\nThe Broncos continue their early recovery from one of the worst opening night losses in the history of college basketball, their 79-78 defeat at the hands of Division-II opponent Hawaii Pacific. Since then, Boise has taken two far more understandable losses (USC and NC State in Maui) and has knocked off Wichita State, Butler, and now Saint Mary’s in a 68-67 thriller on Sunday.\n\nSt. Mary’s gets a chance with 7 seconds left but an untimely slip from Joshua Dent spoils their plans and Boise State pulls off the upset 68-67 pic.twitter.com/H4vIDduLqA\n\n— NCAA Buzzer Beaters & Game Winners (@NCAABuzzerBters) December 15, 2025\n\nSuddenly, Boise State finds itself inside the top 40 at No. 39 in the latest NET Rankings. That’s the second-best ranking of any team from the Mountain West, trailing only No. 30 Utah State.\n\nThe Mountain West is down this season, so Boise will need to be near-perfect in conference play to have a shot at an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. Thanks to Sunday’s win, though, there is at least a path.\n\nThe Zags got the better of modern rival UCLA in a late-night neutral court battle in Seattle. Graham Ike’s 28 points and overall inside dominance proved to be the biggest difference, as Mark Few’s team withstood a strong shooting performance from the Bruins’ Tyler Bilodeau to win, 82-72.\n\nIf Gonzaga is able to take care of Oregon this Sunday, they’re almost certain to begin play in their final season as a member of the West Coast Conference with just one defeat (a 40-point blowout against Michigan in the Players Era Festival championship game). A gaudy overall record, a top 3 national seed, and a 752nd national debate over whether the Zags are actually good enough to win the national championship appears to be on the horizon for yet another March.\n\nIt’s nice for college basketball to have at least a few unvarying North Stars during this period of overwhelming change.\n\nIt feels a little wrong to call Kansas a “winner” after a weekend where star freshman Darryn Peterson was forced to leave the team’s game at NC State after appearing to aggravate the hamstring injury that has been bothering him since the beginning of the season. Still, the Jayhawks got a miraculous performance from Melvin Council Jr. as they outlasted the Wolfpack, 77-76 in overtime.\n\nCouncil, who said afterwards that the most three-pointers he’d ever made in a game at any level was “two or three,” buried a whopping nine triples and netted a career-high 36 points to keep KU from dropping its fourth game before Christmas.\n\nThe issue with Peterson — who reportedly said on Monday that his issue during the game wasn’t hamstring related — is still of significant concern, but this was a win that Kansas really needed to get in order to round out its non-conference resume. The Jayhawks now have a pretty light slate until the middle of January, which will hopefully give the superstar freshman ample time to heal whatever needs healing.\n\nAre the Razorbacks the best team in the SEC? They’re certainly playing like it.\n\nArkansas notched its second top 20 win in two weeks with a 93-86 triumph over No. 16 Texas Tech Saturday afternoon in Dallas. The win was extra sweet considering it came eight months after the Red Raiders eliminated John Calipari’s team from the NCAA Tournament with a soul-crushing overtime comeback in the Sweet 16.\n\nThe difference for Arkansas against Tech was the continued uptick in production from forward Trevon Brazile. The versatile 6’10 senior hit 4 of his 5 three-point attempts and scored 18 of his team-high 24 points in the second half to help the Razorbacks overcome a double-digit deficit. Brazile also added 10 rebounds.\n\nThe performance of Brazile, coupled with 20-point efforts by both Darius Acuff and Karter Knox, lifted Arkansas to victory despite a 30-point, 11-rebound effort from Texas Tech All-American JT Toppin.\n\nArkansas has one major test — a neutral court showdown against No. 7 Houston on Saturday — remaining before the start of conference play.\n\nBefore this weekend, Arizona already had the best resume in college basketball and a team that appeared fully capable of winning the program’s second national championship.\n\nNow, Tommy Lloyd appears to have unlocked the full potential of 5-star freshman Brayden Burries. That’s not great news for the rest of the Big 12.\n\nBurries, the No. 9 overall player in the 2025 recruiting class according to 247 Sports, averaged just 7.8 points in Arizona’s first five games this season, and didn’t score more than 5 points in the team’s spotlight wins over UConn, Florida and UCLA. Against Alabama on Saturday, the 6’4 shooting guard exploded for a career-high 28 points as the Wildcats stomped No. 12 Alabama in Birmingham, 96-75.\n\nBurries, who hit five three-pointers and was 11-of-19 from the field overall, scored 15 points in four minutes during a game-defining stretch in the second half. For a team whose lone weakness this season had seemed to be outside shooting, the Burries performance proved that Arizona can win big games in virtually any way it needs to.\n\nWith the win over ‘Bama, Arizona is now the first team in 30 years to have five wins over AP top 25 opponents in its first nine games of a season.\n\nNebrasketball secured the best start in the history of the program (11-0) with easily its most impressive win of the season (and arguably the most impressive win of the Fred Hoiberg era), with a thrilling 83-80 road triumph over No. 13 Illinois.\n\nJamarques Lawrence’s game-winning three just before the buzzer also gave us one of the best moments of the first month and-a-half of the season, and nearly killed Cornhusker play-by-play man Kent Pavelka in the process.\n\n41-year Nebraska basketball play-by-play announcer Kent Pavelka’s (@KentPavelka) call of Jamarques Lawrence’s game winning 3 is GOLD 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/Vofj6HyU1E\n\n— NCAA Buzzer Beaters & Game Winners (@NCAABuzzerBters) December 14, 2025\n\nWe also got this on-court view of the game-winner and resulting celebration via injured Cornhuskers guard Connor Essegian.\n\nTHE CRAZIEST THING I’VE EVER RECORDED. GAME TIME🔥👀 pic.twitter.com/9hbDYNeXms\n\n— Connor Essegian (@CEssegian) December 13, 2025\n\nThe ending was dramatic, but this was no fluke result. For 40 minutes, Nebraska — who had yet to notch a truly head-turning victory or play a true road game before Saturday — was the better team. They led Illinois by as many as 14 points in the first half and by as many as 10 in the second.\n\nLawrence got all the glory, but it was Pryce Sandfort and his career-high 32 points that did the most damage for the Huskers in Champaign. Rienk Mast added 17 points and 7 boards.\n\nWith the combination of their 11-0 start and last season’s championship in the inaugural College Basketball Crown post-season tournament, Nebraska has now won 15 consecutive games. That’s both the longest streak in program history and the longest active streak in men’s college basketball.\n\nInfamously, Nebraska is the only power conference program to have never won a game in the NCAA Tournament. Suddenly, it seems like we might very well be just a few months away from that not-so-fun fact disappearing from the Huskers’ resume forever.",

    "fullText": "\"I don't want to go back,\" said Katie, my best friend of 20 years, from across a café table in Cape Town. A tear slid down her cheek.\n\nWe were two single women traveling 8,000 miles from our respective homes — hers a one-bedroom apartment in New York City, and mine a two-story house in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIt was the last day of a two-week girls' trip and the longest stretch we'd spent together since college.\n\nNow, the reality of returning to a life that would rip us apart again was setting in, and our hearts were breaking simultaneously.\n\nI felt invincible again. So, why did it have to end? Sitting in that sunny café, we decided it didn't.\n\nSaying that Katie and I \"met\" in college feels like a gross understatement. Both in need of a roommate, we were set up by mutual friends who swore we were the perfect fit. They were right.\n\nWe became inseparable from the second we stepped into our tiny dorm room as freshmen, and for the next four years, we were a package deal: Liz and Katie. Katie and Liz.\n\nSomehow, we balanced each other perfectly. I was the short blonde, always a bit too eager to break the rules. Katie was the tall brunette who was more methodical when it came to pushing the limits.\n\nTogether, we proved to be unstoppable, and our adventures were endless.\n\nAfter graduation, we made our way to Manhattan. Eventually, I was living with a boyfriend in a cramped but happy studio apartment, and Katie lived across town.\n\nOn my 28th birthday, my partner surprised me with a proposal. Blindsided yet in love, I said yes.\n\nFor six years, I did what a \"good\" wife does: holidays with my husband, trips with my husband.\n\nI even moved states with him, leaving Katie for a house in a small town. It was his dream, not mine.\n\nSome say marriage is like two becoming one, but for me, I was torn into pieces. Not only did I lose myself prioritizing someone else's needs over my own, but I lost my female friendships.\n\nThrough the years, I canceled countless plans and declined dozens of invitations for girls' trips. As a result, Katie and I became distant. Soon, she had a serious boyfriend I'd never met and new friends who didn't even know my name.\n\nThat's when I began restlessly circling through a cookie-cutter neighborhood I hated, avoiding my home and husband, in what felt like total darkness. Finally, I decided not to return to either.\n\nMy husband and I separated, and I spent the end of my 30s in therapy to learn how to honor my own needs. It was not quick, but eventually, I became a friend to myself — and, in turn, the friend I felt Katie deserved.\n\nStanding on my own two feet in the life I wanted, I called my best friend from six states away to say the words that I'd wanted to for so long: \"How about we take a girls' trip?\"\n\nSix months later, Katie and I flew to South Africa.\n\nWe adventured on safari and up Table Mountain. We sipped wine in vineyards and sat on beautiful beaches.\n\nAfter two weeks together, it felt as if two decades of friendship had been renewed in ways we never could have imagined.\n\nI realized that somewhere along the way, I'd fallen for the idea that success for a woman is finding someone to marry. Katie had too, likening being unmarried to failure.\n\nIt took a divorce for me to realize I already had a partner for life. We could choose to be single and still be supported.\n\nInstead of returning to separate homes, Katie and I hatched a plan to be roommates again. Twenty years after moving into that tiny dorm room, we upgraded to a three-bedroom house big enough to hold all the lessons we'd gathered in the decades between.\n\nLiving together, we don't have to wait to take on adventures anymore. Somehow, it feels like they find us around every corner, whether it's an unexpected connection, a new love interest, or simply a chance to laugh.\n\nThe world is ours again: Liz and Katie. Katie and Liz.",
