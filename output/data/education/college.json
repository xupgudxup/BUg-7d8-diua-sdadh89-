    "description": "I got pregnant with my daughter in college. Eighteen years later, I can't imagine my daughter being pregnant as she's about to start her new life.",
    "fullText": "I've been helping my 17-year-old daughter, a senior in high school, apply to college.\n\nI've watched her type her applications, and it sparked a flashback to when I sat in the kitchen of my run-down college apartment and learned I was pregnant with her.\n\nI'll never forget the look of the brown linoleum floor illuminated under the harsh fluorescent light, its buzzing the only other sound competing with my sobs. My boyfriend held his head in his hands, the positive pregnancy tests fanned around him like the color sticks at a nail salon.\n\nIs it really possible that I was only a few years older than my daughter is right now? She, who still prefers me to run in and grab the smoothie I preordered because she doesn't like to talk to people? The girl whose room is messier than I ever thought possible? The one whose kindergarten picture was so perfect it took my breath away?\n\nI can't even fathom what it would look like for her to be facing down motherhood in a few short years, so it's stirred some new emotions up for me.\n\nI distinctly remember my boyfriend picking me up for class at the beginning of that semester. The sun was shining, my gold hoops were swinging, and as I hopped into his truck, I felt a surge of hope and excitement for the future.\n\nThat was a few weeks before I would realize that my period was not coming after all. Looking at my daughter now, it's finally hitting me: I was so young.\n\nThe naive self-confidence of my younger, college self crumbled that night in my apartment kitchen, and I can't say that I ever regained it. Becoming a mother at any stage can have that effect on you. It carves you apart, empties you out, and makes you question everything at all times forever.\n\nNow, as my teenage daughter teeters on the cusp of the age I was when I had her, I feel a little bit of loss and grief for my own self at her stage.\n\nSeeing her with the world at her fingertips reminds me of how I felt just before she came into existence. I had no fears. I was confident in a way I would never be again.\n\nBut what I remember the most, among the uncertainty, the anxiety, and the complete reorganizing of myself, is the moment I met her, the instant the nurse laid her on my chest. The moment my newborn baby nestled herself into me, burrowing, it felt as though she had straight into my heart; I felt a complete recognition, like nothing I could ever describe. My only thought was, Oh. It's you.\n\nI remember a complete calm settling into my being, as if we were two souls who had known each other forever, simply meeting again.\n\nI feel like I've spent the past 18 years learning who I am with her and because of her. Overnight, I'm supposed to relearn what it's like to live without her here. I feel a mixture of fear and excitement for her future, much like I did in those early days of her existence.\n\nI also feel grief for the girl I was when I had her, but I don't want her to share in that grief.\n\nI want her to feel the freedom I had at her age, even if I acknowledge the loss of my own.\n\nI want her to have a life I did not have, while never, for a second, feeling guilt for her life.\n\nI want things that feel impossible, for both of us. But she has the world at her fingertips now, and I want so much for her to embrace every bit of it, maybe, selfishly, for both of us.\n\nAnd no matter what happens, I hope and pray that we can always find our way back together, just like that moment we first met, when I can hold her close again and whisper, Oh, it's you.",

    "fullText": "On Saturday, 22-year-old Fernando Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to their first Big Ten championship since 1967 — but the top quarterback's professional résumé looks nearly as impressive as his football record.\n\nWith their 13-10 win over Ohio State, Indiana secured the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history — and Mendoza's performance solidified his Heisman Trophy frontrunner status.\n\nBorn and raised in Miami, Mendoza was a two-star recruit out of high school and overlooked by most Power 4 programs. He was committed to playing at Yale until Cal lost a prospect and called him up with an offer he couldn't turn down: a free education and better football.\n\nAfter three seasons at Cal, where he worked his way up to starting quarterback and graduated from the prestigious Haas School of Business, he transferred to Indiana last winter. The move meant losing his scholarship with Cal, but earning a lot more money in endorsement deals.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, one of the first things he did with his \"name, image, likeness\" earnings was to cover the cost of the two classes he needed to graduate from Cal after his scholarship was terminated.\n\nMendoza, who's now pursuing his master's at Indiana's Kelley School of Business, spends more time on LinkedIn than he does on Instagram, TikTok, or other social platforms.\n\n\"The only social media that's on my phone right now is LinkedIn and YouTube to watch videos,\" he told The Herald Times. He has an Instagram account with more than 80,000 followers, but enlists his younger brother, Alberto, who also plays quarterback for the Hoosiers, to manage it.\n\nA post shared by HeraldTimesOnline (@heraldtimesonline)\n\nMendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also be a top candidate for a job in finance.\n\nHe's spent his last few summers interning at real estate investment firms ACRE and Newmark. Juggling his internships with hours of football practice required a 5:30 a.m. wake-up call and an intricate whiteboard, where he'd keep a running list of action items.\n\nMendoza is just as disciplined with his money as he is with his schedule.\n\n\"He doesn't spend any money on himself,\" his mom told the WSJ. \"All he does is invest.\"\n\nA post shared by Big Ten Network (@bigtennetwork)\n\nHis brother, with whom he shared a room growing up and now shares a car, pointed out that he also doesn't like to spend money on gas.\n\nAlberto told Big Ten Network: \"I go to use the car, and it's empty. There's no more gas in the car, and I'm like, 'We're just gonna use the car and not fill it back up?' And Fernando is like, 'Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.' … And then I have to go to the gas station on like one mile of gas.\"",

No. 5 UConn will take on No. 18 Florida inside of Madison Square Garden.\n\nDan Hurley's Huskies suffered their first loss of the season against Arizona on Nov. 19, but they quickly recovered with four straight victories.

A victory over a top-five opponent would put the Gators back on the right track, though, as they look to build momentum before diving into their SEC schedule.\n\nThe Sporting News has all the details on how to watch UConn vs. Florida.\n\nUConn vs. Florida will air nationally on ESPN.
