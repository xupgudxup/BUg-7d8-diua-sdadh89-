    "fullText": "Michigan basketball was the favorite against rival Michigan State in East Lansing -- a rare occurrence for the maize and blue. The Wolverines hadn't won at the Breslin Center in years and had lost four straight to the rival Spartans.\n\nHowever, on Friday, not only did Michigan go into enemy territory and beat MSU, it did so convincingly in the end. But it wasn't without drama.\n\nThe Wolverines took a 16-point lead into the locker room at halftime, only to see much of that lead evaporate minutes into the second half. With just eight minutes remaining in the game, MSU took the lead, and it looked dire for the maize and blue. But with some clutch shots from Elliot Cadeau and Will Tschetter, Michigan retook the lead and never looked back, cruising to an 83-71 win.\n\nAnd, as it turns out, much of America saw the effort.\n\nAccording to Fox Sports PR, it was Fox's best-ever Friday game in terms of viewership, the fifth-most viewed college basketball game in the network's history, and more.\n\nThe Michigan–Michigan State rivalry game on FOX Friday Night College Hoops drew 2.76M viewers, the fifth most-watched men’s college basketball broadcast in network history. pic.twitter.com/mShYnhXG7i\n\n— FOX College Hoops (@CBBonFOX) February 3, 2026\n\nThat adds insult to injury for the Spartans, who have been struggling to come to terms with Michigan's win on Friday.\n\nIn the aftermath, Wolverines head coach Dusty May decried Jeremy Fears Jr.'s play in the game, which led to some words from Tom Izzo.\n\nThe two teams will match up again in Ann Arbor to close out the regular season in March.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: Michigan–MSU on Fox sets network records in Friday night viewership",

    "fullText": "Michigan football went 9-4 in 2025 despite having a lot going on behind the scenes. The hope with new head coach Kyle Whittingham leading the charge is that the Wolverines won't just rebound, they'll thrive.\n\nBut given the schedule, it will be something of an uphill battle for the maize and blue.\n\nMichigan will play Ohio State, Oregon, Indiana, Penn State, Iowa, Oklahoma, and more in 2026, with the first two matchups mentioned being on the road. Even so, CBS Sports' Brad Crawford (who usually isn't effusive in praise for the maize and blue) is optimistic about Whittingham's first year in Ann Arbor.\n\nIn Crawford's too-early CFP 12-team projection, the Wolverines make the cut as the 10-seed, meaning that they would be 12th overall and face Texas Tech, with the winner of the game set to face Indiana.\n\nAn early season win over Oklahoma win come in clutch for first-year Michigan coach Kyle Whittingham, who has more assets with the Wolverines than he ever possessed at Utah. Whittingham often gets the most out of his roster, and with enhanced resources, he should quickly push Michigan back in the playoff conversation. In this scenario as the 10-seed, the Wolverines would become the playoff's second-ever three-loss team, but first to not reach their league title game to get in. The losses? Oregon, Indiana and Ohio State.\n\nHaving three losses in the 2026 season wouldn't be a surprise given the perceived strength of schedule. However, making it into the 12-team invitational without losing that third game in the Big Ten Championship Game would be a bit of a surprise, given that no one has made it in with a 9-3 record before.\n\nCould that equate to a successful season? Making the playoff but with losses to Ohio State, Oregon, and Indiana? Perhaps, but most likely not in Michigan fans' eyes. Even if the schedule is more daunting this year than last.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: CBS Sports projects Michigan football to 2026 College Football Playoff",

    "description": "Two years ago, I started taking ballet classes. The studio is a much-needed third place for me to escape from stress, meet new people, and learn.",
    "fullText": "Two years ago, I found myself sitting in my car outside a dance studio for my first ballet class. I laughed a little as I texted a friend that I was nervous to go inside.\n\nI was 23, and my last experience with any sort of dance had been many years prior. I also had no natural musicality.\n\nThough I'd always been captivated by dancers and enchanted by the natural work ethic of prima ballerinas, what really inspired me to get out of my comfort zone was the desire for a \"third place.\"\n\nThe term, coined by sociologists, refers to a social setting beyond work and home. As a recent college graduate who'd been feeling stuck in my daily work-from-home routine and missing my long-distance friends, finding a place where I could build a community and escape life's stresses felt especially relevant.\n\nLittle did I know that years later I'd still be returning to ballet classes week after week.\n\nNot only have I learned the right way to point my foot, but I've also learned some valuable lessons that I carry far beyond the studio.\n\nWalking into the studio for my first class, I wasn't thinking I'd end up en pointe by the end of the week, but I hoped I'd enjoy it, make new friends, and learn something new.\n\nI stumbled a bit through the routines, but luckily, the instructor was careful to go slowly and show why each movement needed to be deliberate and graceful.\n\nIt was comforting to look at the other students and share a look of confusion, and a few classes later, it was nice to feel the same pride when we nailed a combination.\n\nWith so many of my friends a long plane ride away, it's been refreshing to have a local group of people with whom I can surround myself and learn something new.\n\nI know the rough sketches of what's going on in my fellow students' lives and the personalities of each teacher, and although I may not see everyone outside the studio, there's a reliable rhythm to knowing what my Wednesday nights will look like.\n\nThe studio owner and I have known each other for over two years now, and she's seen me progress into someone who actually understands the ballet commands she relays in French. We have a regular rapport, and she knows when my birthday is.\n\nHere, my peers see me in a different light than my friends and colleagues do, in my pale pink ballet slippers with my hair tied back, finally mastering bending my elbow just so.\n\nGrowing up, dance was a skill I admired, but not something I ever saw myself doing. I didn't feel confident enough to perform alongside others who might be more naturally talented.\n\nInstead, I gravitated toward playing tennis and writing — skills I felt more confident in, and still do today — but as I got older, I realized I could still choose to do ballet.\n\nOf course, I don't want to make a fool of myself, but as an adult ballerina, I have no vision of becoming a principal dancer in the New York City Ballet. Knowing that has been incredibly freeing as I laugh my way through grand battements and look at myself in the mirror during rond de jambes.\n\nThough I'm not perfect at it, I have fun and find myself learning and growing each and every class. Plus, I also have the opportunity to join in performances, which I hope to do for the first time this year.\n\nI appreciate that ballet has given me a place to learn and make mistakes without professional or personal consequences.\n\nEvery time I enter the studio, I know I'm doing something for both my younger self and who I am now, and that means the world to me.",

    "fullText": "Perfect Tides perfectly captures the older millennial college experience, and a time when nobody worried about being embarrassing online\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nI’ve noticed an interesting micro-trend emerging in the last few years: millennial nostalgia games. Not just ones that adopt the aesthetic of Y2K gaming – think Crow Country or Fear the Spotlight’s deliberately retro PS1-style fuzzy polygons – but semi-autobiographical games specifically about the millennial experience. I’ve played three in the past year. Despelote is set in 2002 in Ecuador and is played through the eyes of a football-obsessed eight-year-old. The award-winning Consume Me is about being a teen girl battling disordered eating in the 00s. And this week I played a point-and-click adventure game about being a college student in the early 2000s.\n\nPerfect Tides: Station to Station is set in New York in 2003 – a year that is the epitome of nostalgia for the micro-generation that grew up without the internet but came of age online. It was before Facebook, before the smartphone, but firmly during the era of late-night forum browsing and instant-messenger conversations. The internet wasn’t yet a vector for mass communication, but it could still bring you together with other people who loved the things that you loved, people who read the same hipster blogs and liked the same bands. The protagonist, Mara, is a student and young writer who works in her college library.\n\nThe earnestness with which Perfect Tides presents the college experience – quoting full paragraphs from pretentious texts, awkward interactions with classmates, stilted phone calls with Mara’s boyfriend back home – predates the concept of cringe. A key difference between the millennial generation and that of gen Z is that millennials did not grow up curating an online image on social media, and therefore had a much lesser terror of being perceived. We’d put up entire albums of terrible, blurry photos from a single night out, write nonstop on LiveJournal, produce appalling juvenilia and then post it on fanfic or art forums.\n\nNaturally, we find this embarrassing now, as do the younger generation, who enjoy making fun of millennial cringe. But Perfect Tides takes place in a time where nobody was worried about being embarrassing online or, indeed, in person. It’s a time before “hipster” emerged as an insult. Mara inhales everything around her – an anarchist philosophy book, music and movies, everything she hears professors say in class, new relationships – and reading, talking to other characters, and writing essays deepens her understanding of these topics, opening up new avenues of conversation in turn. It’s a cute way of gamifying the process of expanding your intellectual and taste horizons. She’s at an age where every experience and idea is new.\n\nPerfect Tides shares an aesthetic with Consume Me. Each embrace the sometimes messy pixel-art of 90s computer adventure games – but Consume Me’s tone is comedic and satirical where Perfect Tides’ is earnest. Both, however, are part of a long tradition of coming-of-age stories that emerge from every generation that has had the luxury of education and a free-form young adulthood. “Emerging adulthood”, a phrase coined by psychologist Jeffrey Arnett in 2000, is a useful descriptor for this stage of life: the extended period of identity formation, distinct from adolescence, that usually happens between 18 and 29 in societies where it is economically possible and culturally permissible for young adults to pursue further education.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is an especially redolent and memorable period of life, which is why there are so very many novels, films and TV shows about young adulthood. Playing Perfect Tides reminded me of Douglas Coupland’s youth-memoir novel, Generation X, which was part of the cultural canon when I was a teenager. And it makes sense that the first generation to truly grow up with games – my generation – is now making sense of those experiences through creating games. The bildungsroman of the 1800s has become the autobiographical indie game of the 2020s.\n\nIt is the very specificity of Perfect Tides – the year, the setting, Mara herself – that makes it feel so human and personal. You don’t have to be part of a specific generation to appreciate that generation’s art: when I read autofiction set in the 1960s or the 80s, I learn something about what it felt like to be alive in that time. When I play these millennial autofiction games, I relate to them more closely – there are aspects of Mara’s young-adulthood experience that closely mirror my own – but I’m still learning something. By spending a little time in these fictionalised memories, I’m learning how someone else experienced those same formative years.\n\nLook, I just can’t face another capitalist-dystopia piece of media at the moment. So I’m going to have to save Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator for a little later in the year, when I’m feeling more resilient. In this strategy-game-meets-stock-market simulator, you bet your credits on the life outcomes of fictional alien babies, watching their lives play out in text alerts. This anticapitalist satirical offering is from the people at Strange Scaffold, a studio that has now made a profitable habit of turning tweet-length jokes into full games (see also Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion and An Airport for Aliens Run By Dogs).\n\nAvailable on: PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 1-3 hours\n\nSony has patented the idea of personalised AI podcasts hosted by characters from its games. I am equal parts horrified and darkly amused by the thought of PaRappa the Rapper reading out patch notes.\n\nUK game retailer GAME has died yet another death, reports the Game Business, having struggled since the early 2010s. Its last three shops will close, and most of its other operations have already wound down. It will continue to exist within Sports Direct and House of Fraser stores.\n\nI’m still not done thinking about Hollow Knight Silksong, so I enjoyed this article by Nicole Clark, on the new feminist games website Mothership, about the game’s unexpected compassion.\n\nBloomberg visited Obsidian – one of Microsoft’s most interesting developers – for this studio profile, in which its leaders talk about how they ended up releasing three games in 2025.\n\nAnd finally: my book about Nintendo is finally out this week in the US, and next week in the UK. I’m doing a bunch of launch events in Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews, London and Brighton. I’d love to see you there – tickets are here.\n\nThere’s a reason that Wii Bowling remains my mum’s favourite game of all time | Dominik Diamond\n\nCairn – obsession, suffering and awe in a climbing game that hits exhausting new heights | ★★★★☆\n\nIron Lung – YouTuber Markiplier crash lands with big-screen sci-fi horror | ★★☆☆☆\n\nThis week’s question comes from reader Gavin:\n\n“Could you explain the current debate around physical game ownership v digital? And the grey area of buying a digital code in a physical box? I can’t imagine those codes will be collector’s items in 10 years’ time ...”\n\nOnce upon a time, all video games came on cassette tapes, discs or cartridges, usually in tragically damage-prone cardboard boxes, with paper manuals. Then, when digital downloads became practical, we had a choice: either you buy your game on a disc in a box, or you go for the convenience of a downloaded version that exists on your hard drive. Now, however, it is difficult or even impossible to buy many games in a physical format. And even when you do, the disc simply prompts a 50GB download, or the box contains nothing but a redeemable code.\n\nDigital downloads are preferable for the businesses that run the gaming industry, for two reasons. Firstly: there are no manufacturing, packaging and shipping costs. Secondly: Sony, Apple, Steam, Microsoft or Nintendo gets around a 30% cut of every game sold digitally on their platforms, which is essentially free money for them. At one point, game retailers had too much power for these platform holders to abandon physical games: too many copies of FIFA and COD were sold at branches of GAME. But now, with bricks-and-mortar game retail a vanishing business, digital downloads are the norm.\n\nDigital downloads are convenient for players, of course, but they also come with huge disadvantages. What you’re buying is a licence, which at some theoretical future point could expire or become unusable, rendering your games unplayable. You can’t sell on a digital code or transfer ownership. For this reason a lot of people still prefer physical media, of all kinds. And everybody hates code-in-a-box. It’s the worst of both worlds.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "fullText": "There is a common angst among college football fans with the College Football Playoff, the length of the grind and for teams like Notre Dame, they’ve had to adjust much of what they do to get to the end.\n\nLast season, the Irish and Ohio State, and this year with Indiana and Miami, saw their seasons conclude almost two months after the regular season ended. The hope was that the CFP committee would make some adjustments to the schedule, but as we found out on Tuesday, that won’t be the case.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the quarterfinal games for 2026 will be played on Dec. 30th and Jan. 1st, and then just over two weeks later the semifinals will be played. The scheduled is very similar for the 2027 season as well, and it just doesn’t feel like college football.\n\nAs Josh Pate pointed out, Saturday, Nov. 14th is the midpoint of the “season” which is crazy to think about. There is no need for such a large gap, and I personally hate that these games aren’t played on Saturday’s. Sure, contending with the NFL isn’t a great idea, but college football has plenty of history playing on Saturday’s. The long layoffs are unnecessary as well, as players are accustomed to just a week to prepare for the next game.\n\nHopefully some changes will be made going forward, but for at least the next two seasons, the CFP schedule will be long and drawn out.\n\nUpcoming College Football Playoff dates for the quarterfinals and semi-finals the next two years.

    "fullText": "The way of the college football world today breaks down to this: coaches don’t get many opportunities to screw up, and anything short of a national championship is considered a screw up. So, given that current logic, it’s no surprise that the Houston Chronicle recently published a column noting that Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian sits atop a steadily warming hot-ish seat after the Longhorns missed the College Football Playoff last season.\n\nFrom the Chronicle: “Steve Sarkisian is not on any hot seat by a long shot. Not after going 35-8 the past three years (with two of the losses in the College Football Playoff semifinals and three other losses to Georgia and, oh yeah, Florida). He reached the CFP two of the previous three seasons and barely missed this past season. But he’s on the warming seat. And he’s got company. Sarkisian is preparing for his sixth season at Texas after seeing 26 of his players transfer out and 19 transfer in, including the portal’s top-ranked wide receiver, two outstanding running backs and two elite linebackers. The big number of those leaving suggest Texas badly missed its evaluations on more than two dozen players or drastically upgraded all of those positions. Actually, both of those premises could be true. Sarkisian at least grasps the sense of urgency among Longhorn Nation because this isn’t a place where you want to miss the playoff two years in a row. But he’s not alone. I’d say the top five coaches with the most heat on them, in order, are Alabama’s Kalen DeBoer, Oregon’s Dan Lanning, Sarkisian, LSU’s Lane Kiffin and USC’s Lincoln Riley. None of these obviously are in a must-win situation like some others. … Those on the hottest of hot seats are Baylor’s Dave Aranda (three losing seasons in the past four years), Florida State’s Mike Norvell (coming off 2-10 and 5-7 seasons), Wisconsin’s Luke Fickell (16-21 over three years), Maryland’s Mike Locksley (1-8 in Big Ten two straight years) and South Carolina’s Shane “Did you see our first half against the Aggies?” Beamer. … Of the group needing to break through and avoid slipping backward, they just need to win big and dispel the notion that they have hit a wall and have to get past it. DeBoer, it says here, is the best coach in the nation not named Kirby Smart, Curt Cignetti or Ryan Day, yet a large percentage of Crimson Tide fans think his days might be numbered if a third year isn’t more successful after missing the CFP in Year 1 and winning one CFP game over an average Oklahoma team in Year 2. Lanning has been a borderline disaster in the CFP, getting squashed by Ohio State in 2024 and mauled by Indiana in 2025 (after dominating Texas Tech). Kiffin may or may not have a honeymoon in his first season at Baton Rouge, but he’s still not been on the sidelines for a CFP game yet in his career. Riley can sure develop a quarterback or two with Caleb Williams and Jayden Maiava, but when is the breakthrough season coming?

    "fullText": "It’s pretty safe the say that the general sentiment around college football is that Notre Dame will make its return to the College Football Playoff in 2026.\n\nThe Irish were left out of this year’s 12-team event, as many believed that they deserved to be in. After what we saw unfold, it was pretty safe to say that Notre Dame should have been in, as it very well could have won it all.\n\nAs for this coming season, CBS Sports Brad Crawford released his way-too-early CFP bracket projection, and he’s got the Irish as the No. 2 seed. Miami, one of Notre Dame’s opponents, takes the to spot, so it seems like whoever loses that game finds their footing once again. Texas and Indiana round out his top-4.\n\nIn this scenario, the Irish would take on the winner of the 7 vs. 10 matchup as Crawford has Texas A&M and Oregon battling it out in the first round. Overall, it’s an interesting take, with four Big Ten and SEC teams, Texas Tech making it again and Memphis as the Group of 5 team.\n\nIt will be interesting to come back to this when the regular season is over, but it doesn’t seem like the worst field considering which teams are participating.\n\nWay-Too-Early College Football Playoff projection for the 2026 season, via @BCrawford247 👀\n\nWhat would you change?\n\n🔗 https://t.co/QnshRG871e pic.twitter.com/Dlc3J28sIW\n\n— CBS Sports College Football 🏈 (@CBSSportsCFB) February 3, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: What seed is Notre Dame in CBS Sports early 2026 CFP projection?",

    "title": "Why SEC will regret College Football Playoff staying at 12 teams",
    "description": "When the SEC’s membership voted to add a ninth conference game, you must wonder whether they thought a 16-team playoff would be in place in 2026.",
    "fullText": "When the SEC’s membership voted to add a ninth conference game, you must wonder whether they thought a 16-team playoff would be in place by the time the expanded conference schedule went into effect.\n\nYou also must wonder whether those SEC members still would’ve voted to expand the conference schedule, if they’d known the 12-team playoff would endure for the 2026 season.\n\nOn this edition of “SEC Football Unfiltered,” a podcast from the USA TODAY Network, hosts Blake Toppmeyer and John Adams unpack the SEC’s inability to strike a compromise with the Big Ten to reach on playoff expansion — and why the nine-game conference schedule might work to the SEC’s detriment in 2026.\n\nThey also debate whether the SEC should have gotten on board with the Big Ten’s plan for a 24-team playoff.\n\nAdams: I’ve long advocated for the SEC expanding its conference schedule to create a better product. However, I’m skeptical that the extra conference game will help the SEC’s playoff pursuits in 2026. You must ask: How much will the selection committee reward strength of schedule? Answer: Probably not as much as the SEC desires.\n\nA nine-game SEC schedule would have paired neatly with a 16-team playoff. SEC teams that finished 9-3 would’ve been prime candidates for at-large selection, in a 16-team field.\n\nThe selection committee still places a lot of value win-loss record, and an extra conference game will make it more difficult for SEC teams to reach 10-2.\n\nToppmeyer: The SEC needed a 16-team bracket for its nine-game conference schedule to pay off. The playoff committee has never selected a 9-3 team for a spot in the 12-team playoff, consistently rejecting SEC teams that pair nine wins with a lofty strength of schedule. Will the committee suddenly start admitting 9-3 SEC teams just because the conference added another league game? I’m skeptical of that.\n\nKudos to the Big Ten’s maneuvering. It argued for the SEC to add a ninth conference game, then threw up a roadblock toward expanding to a 5+11 playoff bracket that the SEC, Big 12 and ACC favored.\n\nWithout Big Ten support, the 5+11 playoff idea could not get approved. So, the SEC strengthened its schedule without successfully creating any more playoff bids. A 12-team playoff that’s worked well for the Big Ten persists.\n\nUnlike the SEC, the Big Ten does not require its members to play either a Power Four opponent or Notre Dame in the non-conference schedule, although many do.\n\nOverall, the Big Ten played the SEC like a fiddle.\n\nAdams: No. This combination of a nine-game SEC schedule with a 12-team playoff might not work to the SEC’s benefit, but that’s not enough reason to get lured into a 24-team playoff. A playoff of such size would turn the sport on its head and devalue the regular season.\n\nWhen we’re talking about almost the entire US LBM Coaches Poll Top 25 making the playoff, it's gotten too big.\n\nToppmeyer: No. If the SEC wants 16, then continue negotiating to try to bring that into effect in subsequent years.\n\nCommitting to 24, when three of the four power conferences want 16, just wouldn’t make sense. College football’s regular season is its greatest attribute. I’m skeptical of any playoff format that would dilute the regular season. The Big Team’s 24-team proposal would do that.\n\nBlake Toppmeyer is the USA TODAY Network's national college football columnist. John Adams is the senior sports columnist for the Knoxville News Sentinel. \n\nIf you purchase through our links, the USA Today Network may earn a commission.

    "fullText": "Allen Wang and Eric Liu, two UC Berkeley dropouts, think they can help college students find love using AI.\n\nTheir dating startup, Ditto, leverages AI to match people based on the data users input into the service. It then plans the date for them.\n\n\"We're bringing people back to in-real-life interactions,\" Wang, 23, told Business Insider.\n\nAfter users make a profile, they directly message Ditto's AI chatbot via text— no app required — about their type and dating preferences. On Wednesdays, users get a text about a potential match. After each date, Ditto follows up for feedback and uses that information as additional data for future matches.\n\n\"People are tired of being trapped behind the apps,\" Wang said.\n\nDitto will announce on Tuesday that it has raised $9.2 million in seed funding, led by venture capital firm Peak XV, with participation from firms like Alumni Ventures, Gradient, and Scribble Ventures.\n\nThe seed funding will primarily be spent on hiring talent across AI and growth, Wang said, as well as toward Ditto's marketing. The company has 10 staffers and has raised a total of $9.5 million to date. Ditto launched its product in early 2025.\n\nDitto isn't the only AI dating app gaining momentum right now.\n\nOther startups like Sitch, Known, and Amata have raised millions for similar products that pitch AI-powered matchmaking as the new alternative to swiping through profiles. Dating app mainstays like Tinder and Bumble, meanwhile, are also testing the AI waters to reignite user interest.\n\nDitto's AI tries to determine whether two people would be a good match by using profile details, such as users' hobbies or interests, to simulate a date, Wang said.\n\n\"Would you guys have a good conversation? Do you guys have matched humor level? Do you guys have similar vibes and values?\" Wang said.\n\nThe dating startup world has a history of targeting college students as early users. For instance, Tinder's early success came in part from its marketing on college campuses.\n\n\"College kids are very adaptive to new technology,\" Wang said.\n\nThe app now has about 42,000 people signed up across several college campuses in California. With its recent funding, Ditto plans to expand to more college campuses.\n\nOne tactic that helps get college-aged users on board: parties.\n\nDitto plans to host several yacht parties across the US, beginning with a Valentine's Day party in Los Angeles (it hosted its first yacht party this summer). At the parties, 100 college students will \n\n\"We are prioritizing growth over monetization,\" Wang said, adding that the startup is interviewing users about what price they'd be willing to pay for dates from the service.\n\nRead the 12-page pitch deck Ditto used to raise $9.2 million:\n\nNote: Some details have been redacted.\n\nDating apps have a \"paradigm shift every decade,\" the slide says.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, online dating websites emerged. Then in the 2010s, mobile dating apps took over. Ditto pitched investors that AI is the next frontier.\n\nThe slide describes Ditto as an AI social agent network where \"AI turns profiles into live agents that can interact on their own.\"\n\n\"Gen Z is tired of swiping and chatting online,\" the slide says. \"They prefer 'coffee chat vibe check' style social: IRL, genuine, light.\"\n\nThe slide also incorporates some old-school video game aesthetics, inspired by Super Mario Bros.\n\nOn a website, users fill out a questionnaire and tell Ditto about their \"type.\" Then, Ditto will start texting users directly.\n\nThe text includes a collage of the user's photos.\n\nAI helps Ditto \"understand the intrinsic and deeper values\" about why two people could be a good match, Wang told Business Insider.\n\nDitto takes user data and feeds it into an analysis agent, which performs image analysis, attractiveness analysis, and profile tagging.\n\nThen, in the \"pre-date reasoning\" phase, a matchmaking agent does a \"vibe check\" and \"hobby match\" before running a \"date simulation.\" The date simulation agent then runs through things like \"first impression\" or \"conversation flow\" before presenting a user with a match.",

    "fullText": "To this point in the season, we haven’t had a ton of major upsets among the top teams in the country. In fact, the top 10 teams in the AP poll have a combined 16 losses, an average of 1.6 per team. That means one of two things – either the teams at the top of the sport have really separated themselves from the rest of the nation, or they’re due for some regression! Let’s see what happens over the next month and a half!\n\nThe Wolfpack have really hit their stride as of late, running their offense behind a pick-and-roll and pick-and-pop scheme with Quadir Copeland handling the ball, Derrion Williams setting the screen, and Paul McNeil and Tre Hollomon spacing the floor. It’s fun to watch, and I don’t think that SMU is going to have any answers for it, lacking the personnel to switch on the screen.\n\nMORE: ESPN, NFL finalize billion-dollar media deal after government approval\n\nThe year is 2026, and the Blue Demons finally have a home-court advantage. In Big East play, DePaul has only lost once at home, and it was to the top-of-the-conference UConn Huskies. CJ Gunn is the type of scorer who can catch fire and ignite an entire arena, and I think Tuesday is the night when DePaul is officially back on the map.\n\nCross-country road trips have meant doom in the Big Ten this season. Here we have Iowa traveling to the Pacific Northwest to take on a healthy and rejuvenated Washington team with Wesley Yates and Jacob Ognacevic back. Plus, the stylings of Ben McCollum generally lead to low-possession games where upsets are more likely.\n\nThe Redhawks are still unbeaten heading into February, but they are starting to show some cracks. On Saturday, they trailed Northern Illinois by double-digits before coming back to win. In the first meeting between these two teams, Miami needed overtime and then a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to come out victorious on their home floor. Now the game is in Buffalo, and the Bulls are hungry for revenge.\n\nWinning in the Fertitta Center is never easy, but if Johnny Dawkins’ squad is good enough to beat Texas Tech, they can take down Houston, too. Stylistically, I think this is a good matchup for UCF. Houston loves to blitz and trap ball screens, and UCF has smart ball-handlers who should be able to handle the pressure and make good decisions. I think it’s quite likely that UCF’s forwards can get Houston into foul trouble.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo’s mom hints at next NBA team\n\nMLB: Mets sign former Dodgers World Series champion\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Mattress Mack reveals massive $2 million Super Bowl 60 wager\n\nENTERTAINMENT: WWE star calls Pat McAfee to reveal shocking 2026 Royal Rumble return\n\nVIRAL: Kendall Jenner halts interview for Tom Brady Super Bowl 60 prediction on FaceTime\n\nThe post Predicting upsets in College Basketball this week  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Not only are the two teams fighting for important bragging rights, they also are near the bubble of the NCAA tournament, so it was a very important game for both squads.\n\nHarvard controlled most of the game in its opening minutes, but when Drew Fortescue slotted in a goal just 3 minutes in, things were already leaning BC’s way. The Eagles started to take over more of the possession time as the first period progressed, and quickly culminating with two goals by James Hagens to extend BC’s lead to 3-0 only 15 minutes of game time after the opening faceoff.\n\nIn the second period, it was Harvard that made quick work of things. They scored in under 30 seconds to start the second period to steal back some momentum. But the Crimson train did not keep rolling, and the rest of the second period was dominated by the Eagles, who outshot their opponent 20-1 for the remainder of that period. Dean Letourneau tipped in a laser shot by James Hagens to bring BC’s lead back out to 4-1 with just 20 seconds remaining, which once again gave BC all of the momentum heading into the intermission.\n\nThe third period was mostly a formality, even as Harvard pressured with an empty net. They couldn’t get more than just a few shots on net, and eventually Lukas Gustafsson completely ended their night with a corner snipe in the final minutes. Boston College came away with the 5-1 victory to advance to the Beanpot’s final round against either Boston University or Northeastern on Monday February 9th",

    "fullText": "The 2026 college football recruiting cycle will officially end Wednesday, but the 2027 crop is already off to a roaring start with a half-dozen five-star recruits already committed.\n\nThe latest, No. 1 running back Kemon Spell, chose Georgia over Penn State, Notre Dame and dozens of other offers on Monday. The former Nittany Lions commit is pledge No. 6 in this cycle for Kirby Smart and Co. and gives the Bulldogs a huge piece to build around — both on the trail and on the field in upcoming years.\n\nWith Spell now committed, six of the nation’s five-star prospects are already off the board in the 2027 cycle. All six are top-15 prospects nationally, with three ranking as the top player at their positions.\n\nBelow is a look at the six committed five-stars in the 2027 cycle, as of Feb. 2:\n\nSchool: McKeesport (McKeesport, PA)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 3 NATL. (No. 1 RB)\n\nScouting Summary: All-encompassing running back that can win with power and elusiveness on inside and outside runs. 5-foot-9, 200-plus pounds with tremendous twitch and leg drive. Plays with low pad level and an excellent center of gravity in order to deliver blows and take them himself. Has breakaway speed in order to hit the homerun. Ran sub-11 in the 100m during his sophomore track season. Shows the ability to catch the ball away from his frame as a pass catcher. Has all the physical and athletic tools to make an immediate impact at the next level and beyond. Younger prospect for the cycle.”\n\nSchool: Cedar Hill (Texas)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 6 NATL. (No. 1 DL)\n\nScouting Summary: “Uber-athletic defensive line prospect with true game-wrecking ability. Measured in at around 6-foot-3, 300 pounds prior to his junior season. Tests as an elite athlete in the combine setting, easily cracking 5.0 seconds in the 40-yard dash. Carries that athleticism over to the field where he has flashes of dominance on Friday nights. Lines up all over the defensive line for Cedar Hill (Texas) while facing top competition. Dangerous pass rusher from any spot. Combines explosive get-off with the movement skills of a much smaller player, carrying elite testing numbers directly onto the field. Consistently collapses pockets and disrupts plays before they develop.\n\n…Has legitimate game-wrecking moments on film. The quickness to dart into the backfield and the speed to hunt down ball carriers is eye-popping. May not possess premier length. Father was a third-round pick by the Dallas Cowboys. Tracking as the top defensive line prospect early on in the 2027 cycle with the upside to be an early NFL Draft pick.”\n\nSchool: Brother Martin (La.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 7 NATL. (No. 1 WR)\n\nScouting Summary: “The most dynamic pass-catcher early in the 2027 cycle and a threat to score every time he touches the ball. Measured at around 5-foot-11, 185 pounds prior to his junior season. One of the fastest top prospects in the cycle, running a scintillating 10.3-second mark in the 100 meters as a sophomore. Brings that elite speed to the gridiron—lethal on vertical routes, easily pulling away from defensive backs downfield. Tough to tackle in the open field and will take it the distance if he finds space at the second level. Shows natural shiftiness as a route-runner, giving him the ability to separate at every level. Among the more productive top wide receivers in the 2027 cycle as a junior.\n\n…Can continue improving his ability to attack catches with his arms extended, but has shown an expanded catch radius with several highlight-reel grabs. One of the youngest top prospects in the class with a late July birthday prior to his freshman season of college football. Athleticism, budding polish, and big-play ability make him one of the top overall playmakers in the cycle with the potential to develop into a first-round NFL Draft pick.”\n\nSchool: Blessed Trinity Catholic (Ga.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 10 NATL. (No. 2 EDGE)\n\nAbout: Jacobs has long been one of the most feared pass-rushers in Georgia. The UGA legacy tallied 102 total tackles in 11 games this fall and is now near 300 for his prep career. He piled up 16 sacks as a junior for BTC and has established himself as one of the premier defensive prospects in the nation, regardless of class. He chose Ohio State over Texas A&M and Miami. Jacobs is the top-ranked junior in the Peach State.\n\nSchool: Wayne (Ohio)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 12 NATL. (No. 3 WR)\n\nAbout: The five-star pass-catcher has already been committed to Ohio State for over a year. He made his pledge on Nov. 23, 2024 and has shown no signs of backing off since, even with the departure of Brian Hartline. The Buckeyes inked five-star WR Chris Henry Jr. after a long-standing commitment and they’ll now hope to do the same with Brown. He’s the top-ranked prospect in Ohio.\n\nSchool: Fort Gibson (Okla.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 13 NATL. (No. 3 OT)\n\nScouting Summary: “Hyper-athletic offensive tackle prospect with rare natural movement skills and a frame that points to immense long-term upside as one of the highest-ceiling linemen early in the 2027 cycle. Measured around 6-foot-7, 260 pounds with elite length (arms over 34 inches) and big hands prior to his junior season. Has the frame to add significant mass once in a college strength program. Lines up at right tackle for his high school, where his athletic traits immediately stand out. Moves with rare fluidity for his size and plays with surprising power through his lower half, generating torque and leverage at the point of attack. Shows balance and body control that project well to the next level. Displays loose flexibility and consistently lowers his pads to handle shorter defenders. Plays with a physical edge and looks to finish blocks through the whistle.\n\n…Further showcases his athleticism as a disruptive defensive end. Doubles as a talented basketball player on the high school and AAU circuit who can run the court and play above the rim. Will need to add considerable mass and adjust to stronger competition at the next level, which could delay early playing time. Possesses an outstanding developmental profile with the big frame, movement skills, and multi-sport coordination that give him the upside to develop into an early-round NFL Draft pick.”",

    "fullText": "The House Committee on Education and Workforce has asked the University of Utah to schedule a briefing to discuss the school’s plans to take money from a New York-based private equity firm.\n\nThe committee, which has jurisdiction over federal education policy, is examining the growing trend of schools seeking institutional partners to capitalize their athletic departments. The group is assessing whether legislative action might be needed to address concerns about the downstream impact of these deals.\n\nColorado's Dempsey Goes From House Objector to China Scholar\n\nSports Tech Mergers Double in Value in 'Landmark Year'\n\nCollege Recruiting Costs Shrink as Football Powers Adapt to Portal\n\nIn a letter sent to Utah president Taylor Randall on Monday morning, a copy of which was viewed by Sportico, the committee requested that the school share information regarding the details and motives behind its potential partnership with Otro Capital, which its trustees greenlit in December.\n\n“While recognizing the escalating costs in collegiate athletics, including revenue share obligations under the House v. NCAA settlement, NIL-related expenses and coaching salaries, the committee seeks to better understand the university’s rationale for entering into this arrangement,” committee chair Tim Walberg (R—Mich.) and Burgess Owens (R—Utah), a former NFL and University of Miami player and chairman of the subcommittee on Higher Education Workforce Development, wrote in the letter. “The information and briefing requested will assist the committee in determining whether legislative action may be necessary to protect students, schools and the integrity of college athletics.”\n\nAs conversations between schools and institutional funds have grown more public, so too have concerns from lawmakers. Last month, on the verge of the College Football Playoff title game, Reps. Michael Baumgartner (R—Wash.) and Haley Stevens (D—Mich.) wrote a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker asking him to limit the emergence of PE deals that “threaten the integrity of university governance and the quality of college sports in ways that will have disastrous consequences for athletes, students and fans.”\n\nLocal state-level lawmakers in both Utah and Washington have proposed bills that would also make it harder to execute these deals.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce’s letter to Randall requests that the university share terms of the arrangement and answer three specific questions:\n\nWhat factors and considerations led the university to pursue this partnership, and why was this approach selected over other potential financing options?\n\nWhat steps is the university taking to maintain institutional control and to protect student-athlete welfare, including compliance with Title IX under this partnership structure?\n\nHow might this partnership affect student costs, particularly with respect to mandatory student fees that subsidize the athletic department, and are any changes to the fee structure anticipated following implementation?\n\nRepresentatives for Utah and its athletic department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe University of Utah trustees voted during their December meeting to allow Randall, athletic department Mark Harlan and others to finalize a deal with Otro. While it’s unclear if that final arrangement has been signed, the structure of the deal was openly discussed. Utah is spinning the Utes’ athletics revenue streams into a for-profit entity, and plans to sell an equity stake in that business.\n\nRandall played a prominent part in the formal 110-minute pitch to the trustees, helping explain the macro reasons why Utah is seeking the money, and why Otro Capital was the right partner.\n\nFinancial specifics, however, have been sparse. The school has declined to share details on a deal that likely tops nine figures. A Sportico open records request for any term sheet between the school and Otro, filed back in September, is yet to be fulfilled following multiple university extensions.\n\nUtah is not alone in seeking institutional money to adapt to the modern economics of college sports. The Big Ten, for example, was recently on the verge of a $2.4 billion partnership with a California pension fund, but those talks are now on hold after pushback from some conference members about the 20-year revenue share commitment that came with the deal.\n\nThe Big 12 is in advanced talks on a potential $500 million deal with Collegiate Athletic Solutions (CAS), a fund backed by RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital, that would let schools take upfront money in exchange for revenue sharing on the back end. That deal, unlike the proposals involving Utah and the Big Ten, does not involve any equity changing hands.\n\nSeparately, a number of other schools, such as Kentucky and Clemson, have created similar separate commercial entities, but they are yet to take outside institutional investment. Those deals are widely considered necessary step for public schools to take on institutional money for athletics.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce, which dates back to 1867, has 21 majority members, and 16 minority members. Under House Rule X, the committee is tasked with reviewing and coordinating “laws, programs and government activities relating to domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student assistance within the jurisdiction of other committees.”\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2025?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings\n\nEverything to Know About the 2025 Emirates NBA Cup",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (DC News Now) — In their Morgan State college dorm in the mid-1990’s, Daronte Jones and Melvin Coleman stayed busy.\n\n“We did a lot of battles in Madden,” Coleman told DC News Now. “I’d be in the bed asleep it would be a Saturday and [Daronte] would walk and grab the controller and put the controller by my bed and soon I’d wake up and he’d jump back in like I don’t see him and be like, ‘oh so what you calling me out?”\n\nIn January, three decades after his Madden battles as a college football player with his roommate, and many professional and college football coaching stops, Jones has been hired as the Washington Commanders new defensive coordinator.\n\nFor Jones – it’s a homecoming. He hails from Prince George’s County, where he attended Bishop McNamara high school in Forestville, Maryland.\n\nIt’s not just his college friends and teammates who remember the Madden matchups. His good friend and teammate from Bishop McNamara Mike Jones also took part in the legendary video games matchups – though he didn’t know at the time he was facing a defensive mastermind.\n\n“He’s definitely the reason why I stopped playing Madden,” Mike said. “Cause he’s reading all your plays and this was the time when he was early in his coaching career… I’m like dude I’m playing for leisure.”\n\nDuring his college career, Daronte suffered a neck injury that kept him off the field. Coleman said Daronte would spend more time in the play calling booth during games and was earning a bigger grasp of the game. He said it showed in Madden too.\n\n“That kind of helped us being coaches and our playing careers were done,” Coleman said. “We learned how to think on the run, think quick, make adjustments quick.”\n\nYou could call Daronte’s coaching career the Daronte Jones World Tour.\n\nIt started in 2001 as a graduate assistant at Division II Lenoir-Rhyne. Coleman said Daronte conducted an interview with the school before they went on their spring break trip senior year. The following years took Jones to Nicholls State (then Division I-AA) as safeties coach, defensive coordinator jobs at high schools in Louisiana and his first return to the DMV where he served as Bowie State’s assistant head coach and defensive coordinator from 2005 to 2009.\n\nJones bounced around more after that. He was cornerbacks coach at UCLA in 2010, defensive backs coach for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League in 2011, Hawaii’s secondary coach in 2012-14 and Wisconsin’s defensive backs coach in 2015.\n\nThen, Jones made the jump to the NFL — first as the Miami Dolphins assistant defensive backs coach, then the Cincinnati Bengals cornerbacks coach, then the Minnesota Vikings defensive backs coach. After a brief stint as LSU’s defensive coordinator in 2021 where he coached star cornerback Derek Stingley Jr., Jones returned to the Vikings, where he stayed until this offseason.\n\n“For most people who think that this is a person who’s coming out of nowhere, that’s not true,” Mike Jones said. “This guy has been grinding close to over 20 years. He’s been grinding and getting information from the best minds in football.”\n\nFor Mike and Coleman, watching Daronte flourish in the football world has been meaningful, but they’ve also seen his growth as a coach.\n\n“Secondary wise, pass defense wise, everywhere he’s gone they’ve gotten better,” Coleman, who is now the safeties coach at Morgan State said. “Somebody is doing well, somebody is probably making the pro bowl. Somebody is probably making all-conference. So the proof is in the work.”\n\nSince 2023, Daronte had worked directly under Brian Flores in Minnesota. Coleman said that Daronte’s coaching influences and style comes from several different legendary coaching trees.\n\n“With him being around [Vic] Fangio, Marvin Lewis, [Mike] Zimmer, Vance Joseph and now Flores,” Coleman said. “He’s got a lot work from them. He got a lot of tape to take from them.”\n\nIn recent seasons, with Daronte serving as the team’s defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator, the Vikings’ defense has played aggressively, focusing on trying to force turnovers and blitzing at some of the highest rates in the NFL.\n\nDaronte’s high school teammate Mike Jones, who is now a counselor at Bishop McNamara says the way he played was pretty similar to how his defenses play.\n\n“He was always in the right spot… When we look at those old films when we get together, he pops on film,” Mike said. “He’s always going all out.”\n\nMike said Daronte earned the nickname “Crow” because “he made crow sounds in the backfield.”\n\n“He would make these crow sounds like he’s lurking in the secondary,” Mike said. “He would take on the biggest person on the team in practice even though he was gonna get knocked down… He’s not scared.”\n\nAccording to his friends, Daronte’s days at McNamara mean a lot to him. Several years ago, Daronte donated to the Bishop McNamara football program. His contributions provide student athletes with scholarship assistance. Daronte’s name is now etched on a plaque in the McNamara locker room, noted him as a 1996 graduate and that year’s male athlete of the year. Daronte played football, wrestling and track & field at McNamara.\n\n“He’s been able to come back and give back to the community itself in terms of the program and the school,” Bishop McNamara football head coach Greg Calhoun said. “But he’s also been able to take advantage of the opportunities to give back.”\n\nCalhoun told DC News Now that he referenced Daronte as inspiration and motivation for his players and as an example to potential recruits.\n\n“I actually just had a set of recruits come through and we just showed his locker again as we always do,” Calhoun said. “A lot of great coaches out here in the world but for him to be selected for that job and that opportunity in this community, is huge.”\n\nBishop McNamara plays in one of, if not the best high school football conferences in the country, the WCAC. The Mustangs last won a WCAC championship in 1990. Since, the conference has been dominated by blue blood programs DeMatha, Gonzaga, St. John’s and Good Counsel.\n\nBut in 2025, months before Daronte being hired by the Commanders, a few seasons into his tenure in Forestville, Calhoun helped his team take a massive step forward. The Mustangs beat their rival Gonzaga, 21-0 on October 11. Gonzaga was the eventual WCAC runners-up.\n\nThe following week, McNamara fell just short to eventual undefeated WCAC champion DeMatha, 12-7. They were one of two teams to come within five points or less of the Stags all season long. It was also DeMatha’s second lowest scoring output of the season.\n\n“We’re not always the first names mentioned in that league,” Mike said. “Now we have something that we can definitely hang our hat on in conversations… Now we have the defensive coordinator of our local team.”\n\nCalhoun believes that an esteemed alum calling plays down the road, could further fuel his players.\n\n“Just knowing that you have somebody of that magnitude at that level kind of puts that pressure on you obviously as the current student in that process, just letting you know you have some big shoes to fill,” Calhoun told DC News Now. “You have some expectations, you have some standards and that’s something that we work to build here in this process and our guys take pride and value in that.”\n\nAnd while Daronte rises in the football coaching ranks, he’s still a boy from Prince George’s County, Maryland.\n\n“I know growing up, everybody was like DC, DC, DC, but now it’s like PG County,” Coleman said. “We’ve got players, we’ve got ballers, we’ve got good thinkers and I think it’s just you’re proud to represent where you’re from.”\n\nAs for what Commanders fans should expects going forward, Coleman said Daronte is “a guy that’s going to be on a mission to be great. To not lose.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIllinois Fighting Illini men's basketball coach Brad Underwood saw his team overcome road adversity once again, as it snagged a critical road win Sunday afternoon to extend its winning streak to 11 by overcoming a talented No.5-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers team, 78-69.\n\nIt wasn't just any win. It's a microcosm of a season marked by raw, elite talent finally gelling together as the season's critical stretch run really gets going. Sunday at Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln was no different, as for the second consecutive weekend, the No.9-ranked Illini took down an AP Top 5 road opponent after doing the same against the Purdue Boilermakers in West Lafayette last Saturday.\n\nIt's the first time the Illini have done so in program history, but it came with a bit of extra motivation that has since begun to circulate in the hours after the revenge win.\n\nMore specifically, the team's whiteboard. There weren't X's and O's, nor was there a diagram explaining the ways Illinois can continue to remain atop a crowded Big Ten title race with a little over a month left in the season.\n\nInstead, it was four simple words: \"Rob the [expletive] bank.\"\n\nWhether it was a jab at the arena's name or otherwise, it certainly seemed to fire up Illinois as it now holds a win against every conference opponent it's played so far.\n\nUnderwood said his players were relaxed and composed in the second half after overcoming a 39-33 halftime deficit. The Illini outscored the Cornhuskers 45-30 in the final 20 minutes, as freshman guard Keaton Wagler finished with 28 points.\n\n“Chemistry and connectivity,\" Underwood told reporters. \"Just the communication… We’ve made huge strides there and we’re competing on every play,” Underwood said.\n\nMORE: Dusty May set the tone before tipoff and Michigan followed\n\nThe Illini are going to attempt to keep their winning streak alive Wednesday night from State Farm Center in Champaign, hosting the Northwestern Wildcats. Unlike Illinois, Northwestern has struggled to stay above .500 for much of the season and is trying to bounce back after dropping a 76-62 game to the Washington Huskies Saturday night.\n\nTip is set for 8 p.m. ET on Big Ten Network as the Illini try to sweep the season series.\n\nHubert Davis buyout, contract details as UNC Tar Heels coach\n\n'Basketball Saved My Life': Why Master P came home to rebuild New Orleans\n\nPenny Hardaway buyout, contract details as Memphis Tigers coach\n\nWhy FOX blocked St. John’s from participating in a major college basketball event",

    "fullText": "Emily Beutner, the daughter of Los Angeles mayoral candidate Austin Beutner, died on Jan. 6\n\nThe 22-year-old college student died at the hospital after she was found seemingly “suffering a medical emergency” by a highway in Palmdale, Calif.\n\n“My family has experienced the unimaginable loss of our beloved daughter,” the mayoral candidate said\n\nThe 22-year-old daughter of Los Angeles mayoral candidate Austin Beutner has died after seemingly experiencing a medical emergency. Her death is being investigated as a homicide.\n\nEmily Beutner died on Jan. 6 after she was spotted seemingly “suffering a medical emergency” on the side of the highway in Palmdale, Calif., shortly after 12 a.m. local time, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) said in a press release obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nA witness in the area — the intersection of Sierra Highway and Technology Drive — had alerted authorities to a woman in a “state of medical distress,” Lt. Michael Modica told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe politician’s daughter was treated at the scene and transported to a hospital, where she was later pronounced dead, according to the LASD.\n\nLASD homicide investigators “responded and assumed control of the death investigation,” the sheriff’s department said. Speaking with the Times, however, Modica warned that this should not be taken as an indication of Emily’s cause of death, as this is typical for a young person found dead in a situation like this one.\n\nAs of Feb. 1, the cause of death has not yet been determined, with Emily’s case remaining open, according to Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office records viewed by PEOPLE.\n\nAustin shared a statement with the Times in the wake of his daughter’s death.\n\n“My family has experienced the unimaginable loss of our beloved daughter,” the mayoral candidate said. “We ask for privacy and your prayers at this time.”\n\nEmily is one of four adult children Austin shares with his wife, Virginia, according to his campaign website. She was a junior at Loyola Marymount University (LMU), where she was studying studio arts, according to a statement shared by the university in the wake of her death.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“Please join me in extending our deepest condolences to Emily’s family and loved ones, and in holding Emily and all who are grieving her loss in our collective thoughts and prayers,” said LMU President Thomas Poon.\n\nPoon also said that the L.A.-based private university will honor Emily with a plaque at its student memorial.\n\nAustin’s opponent in the mayoral race, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, also issued a statement following Emily’s death.\n\n“I am profoundly saddened by the news of the tragic passing of Austin Beutner’s daughter,” Bass said. “There is no way to describe the depth of pain experienced by parents who have lost a child. My heart is broken for the Beutner family, and I offer Austin, his wife Virginia, and their entire family my deepest condolences.\"\n\n\"I will hold them close in my heart,” the mayor’s statement continued, “and I am ready to assist the family with whatever they might need.”",

    "description": "\"It used to be common advice to figure out what you're good at, focus on that, and outsource everything else. We think that's bad advice.\"",
    "fullText": "Mike and Rob Barnes were just 19 and 22 when they founded Selkirk Sport, a pickleball equipment brand, in 2014.\n\nThe brothers had no college degrees, no outside investors, and no guarantee that pickleball, which was widely seen as a niche sport for seniors at the time, would ever catch on.\n\nBut they were hooked on the game, played on what resembles a miniature tennis court with a paddle roughly 16 inches long and a perforated plastic ball.\n\nThe unique thing about pickleball, invented on Bainbridge Island in 1965 by three dads looking to entertain their families, is its low barrier to entry.\n\n\"You can teach someone within an hour, and they'll have fun. Versus a game like tennis, where you have to put in a ton of hours to learn,\" Rob told Business Insider from the Selkirk HQ in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, where he, Mike, and their younger brother Tom were homeschooled and encouraged to pursue entrepreneurial projects. Mike and Rob started their first business in 2009, selling airsoft equipment and supplies.\n\n\"I remember there was a point where dad talked to us and said, 'OK, you can go to college, and you can go down that path, or you can keep doing what you're doing and just double down' — and we were like, let's double down, see what happens,\" recalled Rob.\n\nIt paid off in a big way. The family-run company, which Tom joined after a career in the Marines, is a leading pickleball brand known for its premium paddles, which have been the hero product since day 1. The brothers expect to generate at least $100 million in revenue in 2026 and have expanded to more than 200 employees.\n\n\"We're definitely big believers in education,\" Mike chimed in. \"It just doesn't necessarily have to be traditional education.\"\n\nLike their schooling, the way they operate their business is unconventional. Here are two business rules they live by.\n\nThe Barnes brothers don't believe there's a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to go about business.\n\n\"In a formal education environment, you often learn there's one way of doing things — and your goal is to avoid making a mistake,\" said Mike. \"That creates a mindset where people are just trying to learn the best practice so they don't mess up. Our mindset is more like, let's look at all the different ways people have done things and decide what actually makes sense for us.\"\n\nInstead of defaulting to industry norms, they focus on \"strategic practices\" that are grounded in evidence, context, and their specific business goals.\n\n\"'Best practice' is almost a bad word in our company,\" Mike said. \"If someone says, 'Let's do this because it's the best practice,' you actually have to bring in evidence and explain why it's 'best.'\"\n\nKeep in mind that \"no one's built a great business by doing everything exactly the same way everyone else does,\" added Rob. \"Be willing to be counterintuitive and challenge the status quo.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, Selkirk has embraced vertical integration.\n\n\"It used to be common advice to figure out what you're good at, focus on that, and outsource everything else,\" said Mike. \"We think that's bad advice, so we do pretty much the opposite. If something creates value for the customer, we try to do it in-house.\"\n\nThat includes research and development, which many competitors outsource to manufacturers. Selkirk has the only private sports science lab in pickleball, which they've invested roughly $1 million into.\n\nTheir hands-on approach requires a tolerance for mistakes.\n\n\"You have to be willing to move and make decisions knowing you're going to mess some things up,\" said Rob. \"Our dad always said, 'If you're never breaking dishes, it means you're not doing anything.'\"\n\nHe pointed to Theodore Roosevelt's famous \"Man in the Arena\" speech, which he has framed and acts as a guiding philosophy. The message, he said, is that criticism is inevitable when you're actually doing something.\n\n\"The synopsis is, everybody can judge the man in the arena who has blood and sweat on him. If you're doing anything meaningful, people are going to judge you constantly, so you might as well get in there, try to make a difference, and accept that mistakes are part of the process.\"",

    "description": "Nadya Grisczenkow struggled to find a job after college so she became a full-time nanny.   It brought her balance, happiness, and a solid paycheck.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nadya Grisczenkow, a 25-year-old nanny based in Boston. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nEveryone says you go to college, work hard, and you'll get a good job, and that just wasn't happening for me.\n\nI started applying to jobs, mostly social media and creative roles, during my senior year at Monclair State University in the spring of 2024. I felt defeated as graduation approached, and I didn't have any job offers from traditional applications or the PR firm I was interning at. I remember thinking, \"I feel like I'm doing all the right things.\"\n\nMy favorite quote of all time is \"what you're not changing, you're choosing,\" so I decided to pivot for the summer. I moved back in with my parents and siblings, hopped on a website for care providers and people searching for care to find a part-time nanny job, and became dead set on finding a full-time 9-to-5 by the fall.\n\nThat summer changed the trajectory of my life. Now I'm a full-time nanny, and I don't see myself going back. I made up to $1,600 weekly with the first family that hired me.\n\nI got hired as a part-time nanny for an amazing family, a husband, a very pregnant wife, and their toddler, but I saw it as an in-between before finding a corporate job.\n\nAs a new grad, navigating the job market was so overwhelming — there was a constant struggle to get my name to the top of the pile of applications. I kept getting my hopes up only to be let down, and the rejections took a toll on me. It got to a point where I really didn't know what I was doing wrong, but I felt like finding a traditional job was the only option.\n\nIt felt like everyone, even my sisters, we're saying things like \"Well, you can't just nanny,\" and it made me feel invalidated. As the oldest of five siblings, I felt a lot of internal pressure to set a good example for them.\n\nA few months later, my nanny family offered me a lucrative, full-time nanny position for their second child. I hadn't received any other job offers, and this position allowed me to work with a family I loved and spend more time with my sisters.\n\nThere was no reason to even think about turning it down, but I kept telling myself I needed to get out of nannying to feel fulfilled or make the people in my life proud. I feel like so many people don't see nannying as a legitimate position.\n\nIt also felt like I'd be disappointing myself because I had put so much pressure on myself to find a 9-to-5 job in the field I graduated in. We're ingrained to believe we should pursue a typical corporate job, but I had a gut feeling that wasn't the path for me.\n\nI realized this is my life, and I enjoy nannying, so I took the job.\n\nAfter accepting the full-time offer, I worried I might get \"stuck\" nannying or that I'd feel like the odd one out among my friends because I'm changing diapers all day instead of having meetings. When I started working with a wonderful family and making $30 an hour, those fears melted away.\n\nI really lucked out with my nanny family, because the mom, Hannah, and I became a true dynamic duo. We would take the kids everywhere together while her husband worked from home. She is now my best friend.\n\nThere were times I felt burned out from being around kids all day — it's certainly not for the weak — but I was so happy and enjoyed supporting their family. I'm now living in Boston, working for a new family with three kids, and travel-nannying on the side.\n\nI feel like when we're thinking about our careers, we're taught to figure out our natural skillset and how we can use it to get to the next level. As the oldest sibling, I've always been the nurturing, type A person who's used to managing chaotic energy. I enjoy feeling helpful and supportive.\n\nI thought back to my PR internship and realized that I sat at my cubicle and never felt truly useful. I was an intern, so of course I was doing bottom-of-the-barrel admin tasks, but I didn't feel like I was being used to the best of my abilities.\n\nAs a nanny, I feel so validated, seen, and fulfilled when I'm able to use my skillset to support my nanny family. Not everyone will understand nannying as a career choice, but I feel like I'm finally using my skills in the best way possible.\n\nI feel like I always put so much pressure on myself to have my next steps figured out, but I don't see any reason to shift out of nannying for a traditional 9-to-5. This version of my life makes me feel happy.\n\nOnce I learned to free myself from expectation, I realized that no matter what path I choose, I'll be successful if I feel fulfilled.\n\nMy current version of success means working a lot, maintaining a balanced life, supporting an amazing family, and making a lot of money. I shifted from wanting to be a successful corporate worker to feeling really confident in my choice as a nanny.\n\nDo you have a story to share about taking an unconventional career path? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Michigan State football is reportedly among the list of schools with the most transfer portal departures in all of college football.\n\nThe last month has been a busy one for the Spartans when it comes to the transfer portal, with an abundance of players coming and going from the program. The number of players leaving reportedly ranked among the top of all of college football, according to On3.\n\nAmong all teams in college football, Michigan State was No. 7 in total player departures with 37 players leaving via the transfer portal. Michigan State was No. 2 among Big Ten teams, behind only Penn State who ranked No. 3 nationally, with 46 players departing via the portal.\n\nAs expected with any coaching change, we saw a large number of Spartans leave from this past year's team. This included both high-level players such as wide receiver Nick Marsh, running back Makhi Frazier and quarterback Aidan Chiles, and also a lot of backups and reserves. Ultimately, we will not know until the fall if Michigan State is better or worse off with the players that have left and been replaced by incoming transfer portal additions. But, this high number of players leaving the program through the portal is something that at least is noteworthy and interesting to see.\n\nClick on the post below to see the complete rankings of teams with the most players leaving through the transfer portal from On3:\n\nNEW: Schools with the most College Football Transfer Portal departures🔁https://t.co/lbDS9V8lFd pic.twitter.com/DZrnqLIDi1\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "description": "In college, Cameron Mofid set out on a mission to visit every country — not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront his obsessive-compulsive disorder.",
    "fullText": "As a kid, I pored over maps, flags, and history books, curious about what life looked like in far-off corners of the world. At the same time, I was quietly struggling with debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder, which often left me feeling trapped inside my own mind.\n\nOne night during my freshman year at the University of Miami, I came across an article in my apartment that stunned me. It said that more people had been to space than had visited every country in the world.\n\nFinding that out changed the direction of my life. I decided to set out on a mission to visit every country, not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront my OCD and prove to myself that it didn't have to dictate the limits of my life.\n\nOver the next few years of college, I saved aggressively while working in nightlife marketing in Miami, putting aside just enough to make the trip possible if I budgeted carefully and kept costs low.\n\nWhen I told my parents about my plan, they laughed and shrugged it off, not quite taking me seriously. Not long after, I called one of my best friends. He laughed too and said just two words: \"Good luck.\"\n\nAfter graduating, I made it my mission. I backpacked mostly alone across conflict zones, remote islands, and places at the center of ancient history. On April 3, 2025, I reached my 195th and final country in North Korea. The journey was verified by NomadMania, the world's largest travel community, which confirmed that I was the youngest person ever to have visited every country.\n\nAfter completing my mission, a few places stood out as truly unforgettable. These are three cities I always suggest others experience — and one I wouldn't rush back to.\n\nOut of the hundreds of cities I've visited in my life, Sydney is my favorite. What stood out most was how relaxed and welcoming people were. The pace reminded me of my hometown in San Diego, with the same laid-back energy but an even greater sense of warmth.\n\nOne morning, while sitting at a café, an older couple at the table next to me struck up a conversation and started sharing their favorite places around the city. They talked about the coastal walks they loved, which neighborhoods were worth spending time in, and the restaurants they kept going back to. Interactions like that happened often enough that the friendliness stopped feeling like a novelty and became part of everyday life.\n\nAs I explored the city, I kept noticing how naturally beautiful it was. More than 100 beaches are within reach, including Bondi, where I watched surfers roll in with the tide. In the city center, I wandered through different neighborhoods and took in the mix of historic architecture and modern design. The sunsets were especially memorable. I watched ferries cut across the water as the skyline came into view, framed by the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge.\n\nSydney is the kind of city I could easily imagine building a life in.\n\nValletta felt like a living crossroads of history from the moment I arrived. Sitting at the center of the Mediterranean, the city reflects centuries of Italian, Arab, British, and North African influence, all packed into a compact, walkable capital.\n\nI'd walk past waterfront cafés and, minutes later, find myself standing on the city's fortified walls, looking out over waters once traveled by Phoenician traders, Ottoman fleets, and British warships.\n\nWhat surprised me most about Valletta was how under-visited it felt compared to much of southern Europe. Even during peak season, it never felt overrun. A short ferry ride away, I spent time on the island of Gozo, where life moved even slower. I visited ancient temples older than the Egyptian pyramids and passed through small villages where fishing and farming still shape daily life.\n\nExperiencing Gozo made Valletta feel even more special: a historic capital with easy access to a quieter, older side of the Mediterranean.\n\nKrabi wasn't even on my radar at first, and it ended up being one of the last places I reached on my journey. A Thai friend I'd met years earlier on the junior tennis circuit told me it was the most beautiful part of the country and insisted I couldn't miss it.\n\nHe was right. Krabi Town is the province's main city, but most travelers use \"Krabi\" to refer to the surrounding beaches and islands — and few places on Earth combine land and sea as dramatically. At Railay Beach, limestone cliffs rise from turquoise water, creating a backdrop unlike anything else I've seen.\n\nI took day trips through Phang Nga Bay and out toward the nearby Phi Phi Islands, weaving past mangrove forests and hidden coves that felt largely untouched. And then there was the food. For a few dollars, I could get a delicious local meal and a fresh dragon fruit smoothie from a roadside stall or beachside café.\n\nKrabi is a reminder that some of the most memorable places aren't always part of the original plan.\n\nIndia was one of the countries I was most excited to visit, and it delivered some amazing experiences. Seeing the Taj Mahal in Agra lived up to every expectation, and witnessing the ancient religious rituals along the Ganges in Varanasi was one of the most powerful cultural moments I've experienced anywhere in the world.\n\nThat said, New Delhi isn't a place I feel a strong pull to return to. The air quality was poor enough that I found myself coughing constantly, making it uncomfortable to spend much time outside. In a city of more than 22 million people, the traffic was relentless, adding to a sense of chaos that, unlike in other busy cities I've loved, never felt energizing.

    "description": "After college, my partner and I moved to New York City to live together and start our careers. I had no idea how much I'd miss living with my friends.",
    "fullText": "I still remember pulling out of the driveway of the house I'd shared with the same five girls for three years.\n\nI sat in the passenger seat, waving goodbye as my boyfriend drove away. We both cried, unable to fathom that college was really over.\n\nAs we road-tripped from Ann Arbor, Michigan, back to the Northeast (where we're both from), we felt excited for the next chapter of our lives — starting our careers in New York City and moving in together. But we were also going through our own forms of a breakup, just not with each other.\n\nMy housemates and I weren't just housemates. We were pandemic-era housemates, meaning we ate breakfast together at our tiny kitchen table every morning and took our remote classes from the same living room couch.\n\nMy boyfriend had a similar experience, living with friends in a house around the corner from mine.\n\nSomewhere along the way, both of our friend groups became like family, barging into each other's houses without notice and spending endless hours together.\n\nI had no idea just how much I'd miss that.\n\nJust one month after graduation, I had a cute, albeit tiny, apartment in Manhattan with swanky restaurants on each corner, a pickleball court nearby, and 24/7 access to pizza and bagels. And I was doing it all with my boyfriend by my side.\n\nI had achieved the dream so many Long Island-raised kids like myself had growing up.\n\nBut as much as I tried to romanticize my compact kitchen appliances and lack of windows (and consequently, sunlight), I longed for sunny days on my front porch in Ann Arbor with my five best friends sipping lattes out of mason jars, talking about absolutely nothing.\n\nMy boyfriend missed his version of this, too, sipping bottles of beer with his five housemates, talking mostly about football.\n\nWe both longed to be somewhere else. And I, for one, felt guilty.\n\nStruggling to adjust to our 9-to-5 schedules in a new city, we often found ourselves sitting around the apartment, lacking the energy to do all the fun things we used to love.\n\nI did make some new friends, but I struggled to put in the effort to maintain them. I often wondered if it was even possible to find the same level of friendship I had with my college housemates.\n\nI'd replay the highlight reel of memories in my mind — prank wars that would last for weeks, communicating with our next-door neighbors via handwritten signs taped to our windows, and nights in watching old One Direction music videos.\n\nAlthough we still kept in touch via our group chat, it just wasn't the same as waking up every morning to all my favorite people in one place.\n\nIt was as if I'd been living in my very own sitcom for three years — one that could never be recreated — with the perfect mix of characters, all in the right place at the right time.\n\nAnd like all sitcoms, it had to come to an end. I was holding out hope for a spinoff, but I had to let go.\n\nI realized that what I really needed most was time. There wasn't one thing in particular that magically made me stop missing my friends so much. It took about a year to adapt to my new routine and start feeling like myself again.\n\nIn the meantime, I let myself be sad, and I stopped feeling guilty about it. I leaned on the one person who understood my sadness on a personal level: my boyfriend.\n\nWe talked about missing our best friends, Ann Arbor, and our life together before we moved to New York City. It felt good to have someone who was going through the same thing.\n\nSlowly but surely, we adjusted to our new reality and started finding joy in the little things, like decorating our apartment, trying new bagel spots, and perfecting homemade vodka sauce.\n\nAs for my housemates, we continue to find unique ways to stay in touch. We partake in our own Secret Santa each year. We email each other life updates through personalized newsletters that are way too detailed. We schedule visits throughout the year and meet up around the country. Every time we do, it's like we're back home.\n\nOf course, I still miss them. But I've learned to cherish the people that are nearby — both new friends I've met in the city and old ones I grew up with back on Long Island. I've also made more of an effort to spend time with family. Thankfully, they're only a train ride away.\n\nTwo and a half years postgrad, my boyfriend and I still live together, but now we have a new apartment with a full-sized oven and more windows to let in plenty of sunlight.\n\nWe see our best friends a few times a year and spend the remaining 300-and-something days trying to convince them all to move to New York. And in the meantime, we've built a life we're happy with.",

    "fullText": "This past week was a weird one for upsets. We didn’t get any huge, unexpected upsets of top-tier teams. But we did have some small underdogs pull through on their opponent’s home floor, such as UNC beating Virginia, Texas Tech beating Houston, and Illinois beating Purdue. Let’s see what this week brings!\n\nThe Wildcats have sustained a lot of injuries in the past few weeks, but I don’t think that will matter in this one. We have seen that you beat Vanderbilt by using size and strength in the frontcourt, and this could be a breakout game for any of Malachi Moreno, Andrija Jelavic, or Mo Dioubate.\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide has a myriad of issues going on. Not only are they facing national scrutiny over the eligibility of Charles Bediako, but they also have injuries to Ajay Allen and Aden Holloway. I think there’s just too much going on with Alabama right now for them to be fully focused and engaged with this game, and Missouri has a breakout star emerging in T.O. Barrett.\n\nSean Miller’s Longhorns have shown that they have a high ceiling, coming off a 20-point win over a ranked Georgia team. Auburn has shown us a low floor, with a loss to Missouri already on the schedule. Miller has Dailyn Swain playing the best basketball of his career, and I think he plays a huge role as Texas continues their march to an NCAA Tournament bid in his first season.\n\nI’m going to hop back on my travel schedule soapbox here. Let’s get this straight: Florida State is not good. Cal is better. But FSU has Rodney McCray and Chauncey Wiggins, who both play well at home, and Cal has not won a game outside the state of California this season. I think the road trip gets the better of them here.\n\nSaint Louis is rolling right now — if not for a desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer by Stanford, the Billikens would be undefeated. But all good things must come to an end. The “Battle for the Archbaron’s Cup” has been anything but predictable over the years, and would make a great occasion for Dayton to pull off the upset. Dayton finally has their two centers, Amael L’Etang and Malcolm Thomas, healthy, and may also get back Jordan Derkack for this game.\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nCFB:Most impactful transfer of 2025 college football season\n\nNBA: NBA star Derrick Rose reacts after unexpected surprise ahead of jersey retirement\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl LX graphic resurfaces\n\nTENNIS: Valentin Vacherot hits physics-defying shot at Australian Open\n\nVIRAL: Alex Honnold takes incredible selfie after historic Taipei 101 climb\n\nThe post Predicting upsets in College Basketball this week   appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Depending on the position, a high school diploma could be the ticket to a growing, high-paying job.\n\nBusiness Insider looked at wages and growth projections for jobs that usually need a high school diploma, its equivalent, or a postsecondary nondegree award. We then took the geometric mean of the ones that pay at least $75,000, based on 2024 median annual wage data, and are expected to need more workers, based on projected employment growth from 2024 to 2034. We then ranked the jobs, with the larger the geometric mean, the better the rank.\n\nMany of the top 12 fell into one of three job groups: construction and extraction; protective service; or installation, maintenance, and repair.\n\nFirst-line supervisors of construction trades and extraction workers took the top spot. Employment of these supervisors is expected to grow by 49,000 from its 2024 level, and they typically make about $79,000 annually. It's also one of the roles that typically don't require a degree, but often require job seekers to have relevant experience.\n\nEmployers may be interested in candidates with higher educational attainment.

    "fullText": "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has laid out an NFL-style system of fines for his players if they violate team rules, including $500 for being late to practice.\n\nHe showed it on the video screen in his first team meeting of 2026 on Jan. 23, as briefly seen in a video posted by his oldest son, Deion Jr. Here is what it said:\n\nLate to meeting or film session: $400\n\nNo-show to meeting or film session: $2,000\n\nLate to strength and conditioning workout: $1,000\n\nNo-show to strength and conditioning workout: $1,500\n\nViolation of team rules: $1,000-$2,500 based on severity.\n\nPublic or social media misconduct: $2,000-$5,000\n\nDamage to university or team property: repair cost +$3,000\n\nLoss of team technology or equipment: replacement cost +$1,000\n\nPlayers also are required to wear Nike shoes and apparel while representing the university at practices, games and organized team activities. Colorado has been a Nike-sponsored school since 1995. Sanders also is sponsored by Nike. Failure to comply also could result in disciplinary action.\n\nThere is an appeal process for players, with final decisions issued within five business days. But it's another example of the professionalization of college sports, with players this year getting paid directly by schools for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nA lack of discipline also apparently was an issue for Colorado last year, when the Buffaloes finished 3-9 during Sanders’ third season in charge.\n\n“All these lates and tardies and all these things, we can’t have that this year,” Colorado receivers coach Jason Phillips told the team. “Those are the things we will eliminate… Two ways to eliminate that. Either you change, or we change you.”\n\nSanders has brought in 42 new scholarship transfer players this year, offsetting more than 35 scholarship players who transferred out.\n\n“You all are hand-picked, hand-picked, hand-picked,” Sanders told the team. “We watched darn near every one of y’all.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

    "fullText": "The 2000s brought about a new archetype of character into pop culture: the “anti-hero.” Exemplified on television with the likes of Walter White and Tony Soprano, the anti-hero is a character who is by no means evil, but often has to do bad things as a means to an end.\n\nIn College Basketball, we’ve seen our share of heroes and villains through the years (here’s looking at you, Grayson Allen). But Charles Bediako, in the year 2025, is the exact anti-hero that the sport needs. His situation should bring about the necessary change that can save college basketball.\n\nIf the name Charles Bediako sounded familiar before he made national headlines this week, it’s because he was the starting center for Alabama in the 2022-2023 season. This team was notable not just because they were the #1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, but also because they had an active team member commit a murder midseason\n\nThey also had a star player and future top-5 NBA draft pick, Brandon Miller, who faced scrutiny over how involved he was in the said murder, in which he would eventually face no charges. That Alabama team was a national story every week that season.\n\nAfter the season ended, Bediako declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his remaining college eligibility. He would then play two full seasons in the G-League, never once getting called up to play in the NBA. And now, with the lines more blurred than ever in terms of what is allowed or not allowed in college basketball, he’s back playing for the Crimson Tide.\n\nWhile the NCAA has officially ruled him ineligible to continue to play college basketball, Bediako got a temporary restraining order from an Alabama judge (who happens to have ties to the program), allowing him to play games in the state of Alabama. Bediako shined in Alabama’s loss to Tennessee on Saturday, scoring 13 points in 25 minutes off the bench.\n\nIf it sounds villainous for someone to go behind the NCAA’s back to try to allow themselves to play in a sport that they left almost three years ago, that’s what makes Bediako the perfect anti-hero. No one can put individual blame on Bediako or on coach Nate Oats for this particular situation. Nate Oats’s career is defined by winning basketball games. And if Bediako can help him win, of course, he’s going to fight to get him back on the roster.\n\nFor Bediako, his goal is to continue to play basketball for as long as he can and make as much money as he can while doing it. So, if he’s not going to get called up to the NBA, and his G-League timer is not getting any longer, why not explore this option of getting to play again at Alabama? You simply can’t blame either Bediako or Oats for this predicament — they’re behaving rationally in their own self-interests.\n\nInstead, blame the NCAA. The NIL era has allowed “the line” to continue to change. What do I mean when I say “the line”? The line is the thing that, once a player crosses, he can no longer come back to college basketball. The line simply used to be “declare for the NBA draft.”\n\nThen it moved to “declare for the draft and hire an agent.” When NIL made agents more commonplace, it then became “play in a professional, pay-to-play” basketball league. But then, players like Creighton’s Fedor Zugic, who had played professionally in Europe, began to challenge this convention.\n\nThen, you have Baylor’s James Nnaji, who was drafted by the NBA but played professionally overseas, being allowed to play college basketball this season. What makes the Bediako situation even more interesting is that Abdullah Ahmed, a player who played in the G-League before ever playing college basketball, is being allowed to play for BYU this season.\n\nSo, I say all of this to say, where is “the line”? And has Bediako crossed it? The Bediako situation is so unique and represents such a unique series of events that it is going to force the NCAA into redefining where the line is and creating a uniform, inarguable policy that will make these situations much more black and white in the future, instead of living in the gray area of temporary restraining orders and court cases.\n\nThat would bring about a positive change to the sport in the long run, which would make Bediako the ultimate anti-hero. Not unlike how Ed O’Bannon became the face of the early NIL movement, Bediako can become the face of the line between professional and college basketball.\n\nCheck out all of our NFL articles: https://www.thebiglead.com/category/nfl/\n\nThe post One of College Basketball’s most controversial decisions has a new twist  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Anna Kendrick, 40, says watching her friends go to college made her second-guess her decision to pursue acting.\n\n\"I was really, really jealous of all my friends that were going to college. Number one, because I felt really insecure about not going to college. I have a whole, you know, complex about it,\" Kendrick said on Friday's episode of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nSeeing her friends quickly build community through classes and sororities made her feel even more unsure as she tried to find her footing in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I was 17 or 18. It's really hard to make friends in LA because of, like, the way the city is laid out, but especially when you don't have a fake ID. Even if I did, I looked about 12, so that wasn't going to work anyway,\" Kendrick said. \"And I was just like absolutely terrified and really wondering if I was like, making a huge mistake.\"\n\nHer perspective began to change when her friends hit sophomore year and had to start figuring out their future paths.\n\n\"Even though the thing that I wanted felt like a total pipe dream, and like, 'What am I doing? This is a disaster. It's so hard to carve out a space for yourself in this industry,'\" Kendrick said.\n\n\"But on the other side of it, holy shit, I did not think like, what a blessing to just know what I want. I was like watching all my friends go, 'Oh my god, I don't know what I want, what to do,'\" she continued.\n\nThe \"Pitch Perfect\" star said her decision not to go to college felt especially difficult because it went against the path her family valued.\n\n\"I was like the first person to not go to college. And my dad was a teacher and everything, so it was like very black sheep behavior to not go to college,\" Kendrick said.\n\nShe added her parents weren't thrilled with her decision, but accepted that she was going to do what she wanted. At the same time, her parents saw college as something she could revisit if acting didn't work out.\n\n\"I think there was always that sense of like, well, if things maybe don't work out that first year, it's not too late to just, you know, so I think that was always like something that they had in mind,\" Kendrick said.\n\nIt also didn't help that questions about college kept coming up when she was in her early 20s, before her acting career had fully taken off.\n\n\"Like, oh my god, I have to say I didn't. And at that point, you know, like 21, 22, I didn't really have much to show for it yet,\" Kendrick said.\n\nKendrick isn't the only Hollywood celebrity who has spoken about not going to college.\n\n\"Harry Potter\" star Daniel Radcliffe told E! News in 2013 that he skipped college because he \"already knew\" what he wanted to do.\n\n\"I think a large part of why people go to college is to figure out what they want to do,\" he said. \"I very much knew what I wanted to do, so I kind of just figured I'd keep carrying on trying to do that.\"\n\nIn 2024, Julia Roberts told British Vogue that she regrets not going to university.\n\n\"It wasn't in my cards,\" Roberts said, adding that her family didn't have the money and she \"had no scholarship potential.\"",

    "description": "Remote college in 2020 didn't work for Jacob Palmer. “It felt very intangible, is the best way that I have found to say it ... It didn’t work for me. I hated it.”",
    "fullText": "Growing up in Concord, North Carolina, just outside Charlotte, Jacob Palmer was a classic academic achiever. “I was a good student,” he said in an interview with Fortune. “In high school, I participated in all types of extracurriculars, student leadership, I did a lot of public speaking. I had all sorts of friends.” But he said something changed during the pandemic. “School looked drastically different doing online classes and Zoom calls. It felt very intangible.” He said he figured out pretty quickly that online college “didn’t work for me. I hated it.”\n\nPalmer said that instead of sticking with college, he tried things out, including a stint at a FedEx warehouse for several months, and a change of scenery at his grandparents in rural Virginia, where he worked at a factory for a few months.\n\nWhen he returned home, in need of a job, his mom was putting in a hot tub and she mentioned the electrician working on it was “super passionate and loved his job.” Palmer said he sounded him out, estimating that the electrician was about 29 at the time, and Palmer liked that he worked for himself.\n\n“I had a general interest in working with my hands, fixing and making things, as well as a basic understanding of electrical theory from my time in AP Physics class,” he said. Soon afterward, he started as a full-time apprentice at a small, Charlotte-based contracting firm, earning $15 an hour at first and working his way up the ladder.\n\nHe was far from alone. Palmer’s micro-generation abandoned college in droves during the pandemic, driving 42% of an overall 15% decline in undergraduate enrollment between fall 2010 and fall 2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Overall, college may have peaked, as experts have predicted a “demographic cliff” ever since 2007, when Americans started having fewer children with the coming of the Great Recession, and birthrates have not recovered since, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Palmer was part of a movement deciding to try something else instead of college.\n\n“I spent a few years just untangling the extension cords and doing the grunt work,” he said, earning hours en route to sitting for an electrical license. But even though he didn’t become a college student, he still found himself studying hard, because he had to pass his licensing exam, in January 2024. Just a month later, at 21, he opened his own business, Palmer Electrical. By the end of that year, according to profit and loss statements reviewed by Fortune, he grossed nearly $90,000. This nearly doubled to $175,000 in 2025 and he said he was “thinking $250,000 is a good goal for 2026, but my main focus is still to continue learning and make new opportunities.”",

    "description": "Every Sunday night, my family came together for dinner. But now that both of my sons are in college and I'm an empty nester, I bring dinner to them.",
    "fullText": "In my family, Sunday was always family dinner night. Whether the Packers earned another triumphant win, a swim meet went late, or a last-minute homework assignment loomed on Monday morning, that time to eat and enjoy each other's company was an appointment that could not be canceled.\n\nWhen my two boys headed off to college, Sundays became more subdued. Yes, my husband and I opened a bottle of wine and enjoyed our dinner leisurely, but I craved more. The meal needed something; it needed that seasoning from my sons' snarky retort, a roaring laugh, and even that persistent eye roll.\n\nSince I missed our weekly family dinners, I started a monthly family pizza night across the miles.\n\nThe idea is simple: I pick a day and time, compile the orders, and everyone gets a pizza delivery at the same time. Whether it is my oldest, who wants copious amounts of meat on that slice, or the younger one, who prefers variety, I order enough for everyone — including all the roommates and friends. Then we jump on video calls and chat while we eat.\n\nThe phrase \"everyone is family at the table\" is cliché, but everyone is welcome to join. No, I do not force friends to chat, but they must appreciate my \"rules.\" It is not rapid-fire Socratic questioning, but people cannot just devour food and disappear.\n\nEveryone sends pizza photos, curious comments, and FaceTimes while we are eating. Yes, it sounds like the dinner parties people hosted in 2020, but it works. We catch up, laugh, and just have a collective moment.\n\nSure, I cannot cajole the boys as easily through a screen, but I can get a response that is more than just a one-word text reply.\n\nOf course, some people will say I'm bribing my kids to interact with me, but it doesn't matter to me. The reality is that family traditions are not just holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions. Making time for each other is vital, and food can be the catalyst.\n\nAt, around, and by the table, I have learned much about my sons over the years. It was more than excitement over a good grade or disappointment about a lost swim race. I have seen their better understanding of personal relationships, their appreciation for culture, and their interest in family history.\n\nListening to their word choices and argument construction, and even just watching them sit quietly, is far more telling than another call or text when they are away from home. I might have nurtured them with food, but they grew into the men that they are today because of our family connection.\n\nThis current pizza dinner might be a slice of what we had, but it is one that I crave even more.\n\nWhile my pizza night family dinner solution works with college kids, I look forward to keeping this tradition going long after they graduate. Whether one is in Florida and the other is halfway around the world, we can and should make our family a priority. Every overlooked opportunity is a missed one.\n\nSince pizza, or some version of flatbread, can be found anywhere in the world, there are no excuses for skipping this dinner. Even on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean, family pizza night is on the schedule. No matter how I slice it, the concept works.\n\nFor any parent looking to keep family bonds strong, creative solutions are all around. Whether it is a pizza, grandma's cookies, or a Big Mac, food is a form of communication. My family tradition tells my boys that the time we spend together nourishes me far beyond the food served on the plate.",

    "title": "Two brothers skipped college to start a pickleball company before the game was cool. They cashed in on the pandemic boom and expect 9 figures in revenue in 2026.",
    "description": "Brothers Rob and Mike Barnes started Selkirk Sport in 2014, when they were just 19 and 22 — and when pickleball was considered \"a senior sport.\"",
    "fullText": "If you play pickleball, you've probably seen a Selkirk paddle on the court. You might even use one yourself.\n\nThe Idaho-based, family-run company Selkirk Sport has become practically synonymous with pickleball. It makes premium paddles, shoes, apparel, balls, and nets — \"everything except the court surface,\" said Tom Barnes, the youngest of the three brothers who co-own the company.\n\nThere's just one nonnegotiable: Whatever they produce has to stay in the pickleball lane.\n\n\"We will only ever do pickleball. This was intentional from day one,\" Tom, the director of R&D, told Business Insider during a tour of the company's innovation lab in Coeur d'Alene, where paddles are put through rigorous stress testing using cannons and CT scanners. \"It's called Selkirk Sport. It's not called Selkirk Sports.\"\n\nTom joined the company after his older brothers, Mike and Rob, who started Selkirk alongside their father, Jim, in 2014. At the time, Mike and Rob were just 19 and 22, but it wasn't their first venture.\n\nA few years prior, they'd started a company selling airsoft equipment out of their dad's basement. It was part of a homeschool project. Jim, a retired fireman, saw value in teaching his kids entrepreneurial skills. The company quickly outgrew the basement and took over their childhood home. By 2013, they had leased a small building.\n\nFor a short time, they ran both companies simultaneously, but eventually sold the airsoft business and chose to skip college to go all-in on Selkirk.\n\nIt was a risk. Back then, pickleball had a very different reputation. It was considered \"a senior sport,\" said Rob. He and Mike, who first discovered the game at a local rec center in 2009 and were immediately hooked, were convinced it would take off beyond the retirement community.\n\nThey were right, but it took years — and a global pandemic that encouraged socially distant activities — before the rest of the country caught on.\n\nThe Barnes brothers saw a lot of opportunity in the pickleball space, as there was virtually zero competition.\n\nThe paddle market was wide open, said Mike: \"Everyone had basically the same paddle. There wasn't innovation. There wasn't anything new.\"\n\nThey set out to change that. Their first year in business, 2014, was pure trial and error. They sourced materials, assembled paddles themselves, and tested and tweaked them until they were satisfied.\n\n\"It was definitely more of an art form than a science back then,\" Rob said.\n\nToday, Selkirk has invested millions into an in-house innovation lab dedicated to understanding the physics of pickleball and building high-performance equipment. But, for years, the company broke even, and the brothers barely paid themselves, despite working 100-hour weeks.\n\n\"I calculated it once,\" Mike said. \"When you factor in the hours we worked versus what we paid ourselves, we probably made less than minimum wage for the first eight years.\"\n\nThey never felt discouraged. Pickleball continued gaining traction, and the company grew every year. They said Selkirk has posted double-digit annual growth over the past decade.\n\nThen, the pandemic hit. After a brief shutdown during which public parks and courts were closed, pickleball emerged as a safe, socially distanced activity.\n\n\"And then it just kind of never stopped.\"\n\nAs pickleball has continued to win over Americans — it's been deemed the fastest-growing sport in the US three years in a row by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association (SFIA) — the market has become increasingly competitive.\n\nIn the early years, the brothers were competing with five to 10 brands. Now, it's closer to 600, said Mike: \"After the pandemic, interest rates were low. Lots of easy money and investment flowed into the sport, and so the number of brands exploded.\"\n\nConcentrating on one sport, Mike said, is their edge.\n\n\"We think our ability to focus is one of our secret weapons. You've seen major brands like Head and Adidas try to enter the pickleball market, but they've been really struggling to make an impact. We see pickleball more like golf, where you need to be an endemic brand that's really focused.\"\n\nIt's worked so far. Selkirk went from 16 employees in January 2019 to 230 by January 2026, and said revenue has increased by 1,900% since 2019. The company fulfills roughly 1,000 orders a day and up to 2,500 during the holiday season. They also have more than 1,400 retail partners, including Dick's Sporting Goods and Target, as well as an exclusive partnership with Costco.\n\nThe brothers plan to stay ahead by continuing to invest in R&D to deliver premium products.\n\nOutside capital will help with that.\n\nEarlier this year, Selkirk took its first-ever institutional funding: a $30 million growth equity investment from Bluestone Equity Partners, Forbes reported. It also reported that Selkirk expects to generate at least $100 million in revenue in 2026.\n\nThose are big numbers, but it's been more than a decade in the making, Mike pointed out: \"It's a lot of work. I think there's a lot of glamour nowadays — a lot of hype about what it means to be an entrepreneur — and, at the end of the day, it is about doing the boring things and just waking up and being consistent every day.\"\n\nTaking a chance on a game they believed had potential before most everyone else did helped, added Rob: \"We got into pickleball before it was cool. If you're waiting to jump into the latest trend, you're probably too late.\"",

    "fullText": "Louisville women’s basketball hosting Boston College on Saturday had all the makings of a trap game.\n\nThe seventh-ranked Cardinals were coming off two difficult wins, at Notre Dame and N.C. State, the weekend before. Then, their game against the Eagles, who were on a 13-game losing streak, had to be played a day early due to Winter Storm Fern. Louisville (19-3, 9-0 ACC) didn’t have the cleanest start to the game, turning the ball over six times in the first quarter. But the squad proved its ability to push through mistakes and avoid the trap, recording a 85-56 win over Boston College (4-18,0-9) at the KFC Yum! Center.\n\nUofL downing N.C. State and Notre Dame on the road showed how high its celling could be. Avoiding a letup in less competitive games will be critical for the Cardinals as they remain in the hunt for a regular-season ACC championship. Four of the Cardinals' final nine ACC opponents have losing records in conference play.\n\nMackenly Randolph took her turn leading the Cardinals with a career high-tying 13 points as the team recorded its 12th straight victory. It was the sixth straight game where UofL had a different leading scorer. The offense was needed to make up for the team’s turnover problem, many of which have been unforced. Louisville had a combined 21 turnovers against the Wolfpack and Irish last weekend but had 16 after the third quarter against Boston College.\n\nThe Eagles only totaled nine points off the miscues as part of a struggling offense that knocked down 29% of its shots from the field.\n\nWhen they weren’t turning it over, the Cardinals were efficient shooters. They made 55% of their field goals with all 12 of their available players entering the scoring column. UofL built a 10-0 lead in the first quarter, and Boston College never got closer than eight points for the rest of the game. The Cardinals’ lead ballooned to 42 points in the first four minutes of the fourth quarter, and the squad sailed to a win.\n\nLouisville has a road trip out west next week, beginning with Stanford at 8 p.m. Thursday and California at 2 p.m. next Sunday.\n\nReach Louisville football, women's basketball and baseball beat writer Alexis Cubit at acubit@gannett.com and follow her on X at @Alexis_Cubit.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Boston College vs Louisville women's basketball score, ACC standings",

    "description": "Get the best Tennessee vs. Alabama predictions ahead of Saturday's matchup in Tuscaloosa. Free college basketball picks for January 24.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Volunteers look to get their season back on track as they head to Tuscaloosa for a showdown with the No. 17 Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nTennessee has lost three of its last five, but that slide can’t be pinned on five-star freshman Nate Ament, who I’m backing to have a big game in my Tennessee vs. Alabama predictions.\n\nHere are my best free college basketball picks for this conference clash on Saturday, January 24.\n\nTennessee vs Alabama best bet: Nate Ament Over 15.5 points (-120)\n\nTennessee forward Nate Ament is averaging 15.4 points and 6.3 rebounds per game and has shown improved efficiency of late. The silky-smooth 6-foot-10 freshman is shooting 49.1% from the field over his last six games after connecting at just a 38% clip across his first 12 contests.\n\nAment has scored 17 or more points in three straight games and draws a favorable matchup tonight against an Alabama team that plays at a blazing-fast pace while offering little resistance on defense.\n\nThe Crimson Tide are 329th nationally in points allowed per game (82.6), with that number ballooning to 86.8 against high-major opponents. They also sit outside the top 300 in free throws allowed per game (25.2), while Ament ranks in the top 15th percentile in free-throw rate.\n\nAment’s ability to score in transition and consistently get to the line should help him eclipse his points total tonight.\n\nLet’s also back Ament to have a productive night on the glass, as Alabama’s extremely fast tempo has the Tide ranked 358th in rebounds allowed per game (41.3).\n\nTennessee hasn’t looked great of late, but neither has Alabama, which is 2–7 ATS in its last nine games against Top-100 KenPom opponents at home. The Vols check in at No. 23 at KenPom and are 14th in adjusted defensive efficiency.\n\nTennessee would have a solid chance to cover this spread even if the Tide were at full strength, and that may not be the case. Alabama’s second- and third-leading scorers, Aden Holloway and Amari Allen, have both been downgraded to questionable for tonight.\n\nWith the Tide possibly missing their second and third-highest scorers against a strong Vols defense, I'm leaning towards the Under on a lofty total.\n\nThe Under has cashed in 10 of 12 meetings between these SEC foes during Rick Barnes' tenure.\n\nSpread: Tennessee +6.5 (-110) | Alabama -6.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Tennessee +230 | Alabama -280\n\nOver/Under: Over 167.5 (-110) | Under 167.5 (-110)\n\nThe Vols have gone 4-0 SU and 3-1 ATS in the last four meetings between these conference foes.

    "description": "D1 college football was my entire life, so when it ended, I completely lost myself and gained weight. I turned to boxing to lose 120 pounds.",
    "fullText": "When my D1 college football career ended, I didn't just lose the game. I lost my identity.\n\nFootball had structured my entire life: my schedule, my body, my purpose. When that structure disappeared, I didn't know who I was anymore. I had been living what I now recognize as a lukewarm lifestyle, doing just enough to get by, but not anchored in anything solid. Without football, there was nothing left to lean on.\n\nI let my life deteriorate, and it took a lot to get back on track.\n\nGrief and uncertainty compounded quickly. I withdrew from people. I stopped training. I stopped caring for my body. I gained weight rapidly and avoided mirrors. By the time I finally confronted reality, I weighed around 300 pounds.\n\nAt my lowest point, I was living at home and working at FedEx, making roughly $400 a week. There is nothing wrong with honest work, but for me, it symbolized how far I had fallen from the man I once believed I was called to be.\n\nI wasn't just overweight. I felt directionless, embarrassed, and spiritually empty.\n\nOne night, exhausted and overwhelmed, I prayed honestly for the first time in a long time. I didn't ask for success or shortcuts. I asked for strength, clarity, and the courage to face myself. That prayer didn't change everything overnight, but it changed the direction of my life.\n\nWhat followed wasn't motivation. It was obedience, discomfort, and discipline.\n\nI knew I had to get uncomfortable if I wanted a different life. Comfort had nearly destroyed me, so I started showing up early, doing things that scared me, and putting myself in environments that demanded confidence before I felt ready. Faith gave me the foundation, but discipline gave me the reps.\n\nI didn't grow up thinking of myself as violent. I didn't believe I was capable of real aggression or dominance. Stepping into a boxing gym changed everything. You can't hide in the ring. Fear, insecurity, and doubt show up immediately. Training humbled me. It also rebuilt me.\n\nSlowly, the weight came off. Over nine months, I lost 120 pounds. The first six months were the most dramatic, nearly 85 pounds, but the physical change was only part of it. I was rebuilding confidence, identity, and belief in myself one disciplined day at a time.\n\nWhen I entered the Houston Golden Gloves tournament, I wasn't chasing a title. I was testing who I had become. Standing in the ring, I realized I wasn't becoming someone new. I was finally operating as the man I always believed I was capable of being. Discipline had uncovered confidence. Faith had restored identity.\n\nThat same approach reshaped the rest of my life.\n\nI transitioned into a new professional path, working remotely. I finally had a financial turnaround. It was the compound effect of disciplined habits applied everywhere.\n\nLosing Clay and losing football forced me to confront a hard truth: Life doesn't pause to let you grieve neatly. Loss comes in waves. Without structure and faith, it can pull you under.\n\nWhat I've learned is that rebuilding doesn't start with motivation. It starts with obedience. Discipline creates stability. Faith gives it meaning.",

    "title": "Letters to Sports: Readers debate whether the Dodgers are ruining baseball",
    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times give their thoughts on the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker, the Rams, the LeBron James-Jeanie Buss rift and college football.",
    "fullText": "The fury over the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker makes me wonder who's shouting the loudest?\n\nCould it be desperate, unfortunate fans whose beloved teams are owned by inheritors, nepo families, or private equity bros who celebrate their glamorous assets?\n\nSo how about a new metric in the sports page to accompany the ranking of teams and players: ownership. Not simply by wealth, but wisdom, brains and commitment. And for fun let's call it the McCourt-Moreno Index.\n\nIt's time we hold the Marge Schotts of pro sports accountable for the franchises they mismanage.\n\nThere are some alarming implications to Bill Plaschke's \"If it blows up baseball, so be it.\" Perhaps he means that MLB should be reduced to a burning garbage heap with three teams atop — Yankees, Cubs and Dodgers — because they were the only ones who went into the TV business and peddled their services for billions in the three largest TV markets.\n\nMaybe he yearns to transform MLB into the NHL of my childhood, with six teams. That was OK if you lived in a shallow arc extending between New York and Chicago — not so good for everyone else.\n\n\"So be it,\" as Plaschke would say, but I can guarantee I won't be the only one who isn't watching anymore.\n\nNaturally Dodger fans are all excited about the signing of the $60-million-a-year All-Star right fielder, Kyle Tucker. But we're not going to be happy when Dodger Stadium becomes the first MLB ballpark with a two-drink minimum.\n\nAs everyone seems to be raving about the Dodgers' acquisition of Kyle Tucker, I note the following: There is another player who was recently signed by the Yankees for less money and less signing bonus than Tucker who had higher numbers last year in average, home runs and WAR. He also plays more positions. Hadn’t the Dodgers heard of Cody Bellinger? Bellinger as a Yankee will never feel right to me.\n\nAsk a Major League Baseball owner like Arte Moreno, who sells out his ballpark whenever the Dodgers come to Anaheim, and sees Angel broadcast ratings surge whenever his team plays the Dodgers, if he thinks the Dodgers are ruining the game.\n\nThe Rams won the battle of which team gets to lose to Seattle.\n\nThe NFL needs to clarify exactly what does and doesn’t constitute pass interference. There is no consistency as to how it's called with each official seeming to have their own definition of what constitutes pass interference. It has gotten to the point where it’s worse than major league umpires and their own definition of the strike zone. NFL, you need to clean this up because these are major calls that are ruining games.\n\nBill Plaschke finally wrote a column about the Lakers with which I agree. LeBron James is the past, Austin Reaves is the future, and $50 million will help the Lakers rebuild. Yes, it's really as simple as that.\n\nWith the Lakers defense costing them multiple games, reminiscent of the coach Mike (no D)'Antoni days, the only real interesting Laker news last week were the alleged Jeanie Buss comments about the King. They sounded like they were lines taken from a scene in \"The Godfather\" .... \"What have I done to make you treat me so disrespectfully.\" My opinion is that it \"was not personal and strictly business.\"\n\nWhen asked after each game how he'd celebrate another victory, Indiana's Curt Cignetti would say, \"With a beer.\" After guiding his team to an undefeated season, and then winning the national championship, I doubt the Hoosiers' coach will ever have to buy another beer again.\n\nLincoln Riley is officially on the clock. In two years Curt Cignetti took a woebegone college team, with nary a five-star player, to an undefeated national championship. Cignetti has proven that, even in the NIL era, coaching matters. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick …\n\nCurt Cignetti and Indiana football playing in and winning the national championship was a modern-day version of the movie \"Hoosiers\" and would have made coach Norman Dale (actor Gene Hackman) proud. Now the question is, can new UCLA football coach Bob Chesney and his 40-plus transfers be the second coming of Indiana? Only time will tell.\n\nKings president Luc Robitaille appears to be happy with the Kings' status quo that appears to be getting one point every game in an overtime or shootout loss. Should we start referring to him as Luc RobitailleandthenloseinOT?\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views. Letters should be brief and become the property of The Times.

    "fullText": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A lawyer for fired University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore declared his innocence Thursday and said charges of home invasion and stalking were based on an effort by a staff member to get a financial windfall from the school's “deep pockets.\"\n\nIn a court filing, defense attorney Ellen Michaels responded to allegations that shocked college football in December. It also signals that Moore, who was fired for a relationship with the staffer and arrested hours later, is fighting the charges and wants the case dismissed.\n\n“This Court is not confronted with a close call or a technical defect,” Michaels wrote. “It is confronted with a prosecution that never should have begun.”\n\nMoore was abruptly fired on Dec. 10 for having an inappropriate relationship and for lying during the university's investigation, his dismissal letter states.\n\nAuthorities say Moore later that day entered the woman’s apartment, blamed her for the firing and grabbed butter knives and kitchen scissors while threatening to kill himself.\n\nA prosecutor quoted Moore as telling the woman, “My blood is on your hands.”\n\nMoore, 39, has pleaded not guilty to charges of felony home invasion, stalking and illegal entry.\n\nMichaels said the warrant to arrest Moore was deeply flawed because police wrongly informed a magistrate that Moore had been stalking the woman for months and was dangerous.\n\nMichaels said police relied on misinformation from the woman's personal lawyer, Heidi Sharp, as it investigated what happened. Michaels doesn't dispute that Moore turned up at the woman's apartment, but she claims there's no evidence that she had told him to stay away.\n\n“A magistrate must be given a fair and accurate picture. When the picture is distorted, the warrant cannot stand,” Michaels wrote.\n\nShe accused Sharp of giving information to police to “villainize Mr. Moore and maximize the chances of obtaining a large settlement from the deep pockets of the University of Michigan.”\n\nA message seeking comment from Sharp was not immediately returned.\n\nEarlier Thursday, a judge held a hearing to get an update on the case. Michaels disclosed that she had filed the request to quash the arrest and would argue it at a future date.\n\nWashtenaw County assistant prosecutor Kati Rezmierski said she had just received the filing. The next hearing was set for Feb. 17.\n\nMoore arrived at the courthouse with his wife, Kelli and waited in an adjacent courtroom for his case to be called. He declined to comment but stood nearby when Michaels briefly spoke to reporters and said he's innocent.\n\nMoore coached the Wolverines for two seasons as the successor to Jim Harbaugh, who won a national championship before quitting to become coach of the NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nKyle Whittingham, who coached Utah for two decades, is the new Michigan coach.",

Michael previously worked as Uber's chief business officer.\n\n\"We're going to try to make that a badge of honor,\" he added.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management, which is headed by former VC Scott Kupor, is coordinating the early-career program in partnership with other agencies, including the Department of Defense.

    "description": "A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.  The ruling from U.S.",
    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”\n\nDuring the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”\n\n“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”\n\nIn his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.\n\n“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment\n\nDuring last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.\n\nAmong the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.\n\nBut in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.\n\nThe decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.\n\nAnother was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nDuring the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country's top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.\n\n“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”\n\nRamya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”\n\n“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",

    "description": "The 2025 college football season is now in the books, which means the final AP Poll of the year is out. Where did the Trojans come in?",
    "fullText": "On Monday night, Indiana defeated Miami to win its first ever national championship. With it, the 2025 college football season is now officially in the books.\n\nOn Tuesday, the final AP Poll of the season was released. USC came in at No. 20—four spots lower than where it ranked in the final regular season poll last month. The Trojans dropped their final game of the year, falling 30-27 to TCU in the Alamo Bowl.\n\nUSC was one of six Big Ten teams ranked in the final poll. The national champion Hoosiers were No. 1, followed by No. 4 Oregon and No. 5 Ohio State. In addition, Iowa was ranked No. 17 and Michigan No. 21.\n\nDoes it make sense to have USC three spots behind an Iowa team that the Trojans finished with the same record as and beat head-to-head? No. Is it worth complaining about at this point? Also no. Finishing a few spots higher in the final poll would not have meant much for USC in the scheme of things.\n\nNext season, USC is slated to face three of the top five teams from the final 2025 rankings. The Trojans will visit Indiana and host Ohio State and Oregon. It will certainly not be an easy road next year as USC enters what could be a make-or-break season for head coach Lincoln Riley.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: USC football ranked No. 20 in final AP Poll of season",

    "fullText": "The power of TikTok propelled one user's content to primetime television, and people are loving it.\n\nTikToker Romeo Bingham, 25, is receiving an outpouring of support after their viral Dr Pepper jingle was picked up by the brand and used in a commercial that aired during Monday's College Football Playoff National Championship game. Social media users quickly caught onto the audio and praised the partnership.\n\nSO proud of you @Romeo!! Well deserved! 🥹❤️ #drpepper #goodandnice #drpepperjingle #nationalchampionshipgame #espn\n\n\"Dr Pepper, baby, it's good and nice,\" Bingham sang in a TikTok video posted December 23.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the post had over 44 million views and 50,000 comments from users and brands alike. Bingham's video gained traction on TikTok before the jingle was featured in a TV commercial, prompting some users to predict a collaboration was on the horizon.\n\n\"I am waiting for Dr Pepper to offer a massive contract,\" one commenter said on December 29.\n\n@Dr Pepper please get back to me with a proposition we can make thousands together. #drpepper #soda #beverage\n\nBingham and Dr Pepper did not reveal the terms of their deal and did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSeveral companies, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Panera Bread, and Hyundai, have also pounced on Bingham's comments and requested jingles for their brands.\n\nBingham created a song for Vita Coca, which the beverage brand posted on TikTok on January 16.\n\n@Romeo jingle stays on repeat #vitacoco #fyp #coconutwater #jingle #vitacocotreats\n\nThe partnership between Bingham and Dr Pepper appeared to be in the works for a few weeks leading up to the game, which ESPN reported attracted over 20 million viewers in 2025. On December 31, Dr Pepper commented under Bingham's video, telling them to check their DMs.\n\nSupport for Bingham has continued, with users sharing videos and comments congratulating them on the collaboration. Others have chimed in, saying they hoped Bingham got a good payday.\n\nI hope that girl who did the Dr. pepper jingle got paid very well. Cause I just saw the commercial.\n\nAnd the marketing strategy seems to be working for Bingham. As of Wednesday, Bingham is operating a website offering the Dr Pepper effect to brands.\n\n\"I'm buying a Dr Pepper just because,\" one user wrote on TikTok.",

    "description": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.",
    "fullText": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.\n\nThe device – which uses an approach called trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) - was cleared for use by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) to treat ADHD in 2019 based on a small study. These new findings from a larger multicentre trial, published in the journal Nature Medicine, suggest authorities should revisit the original evidence that supported the FDA clearance. Notably, TNS is currently not recommended for use in the UK by NICE guidelines.\n\nThe trial was run in collaboration with University of Southampton and funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Programme, a partnership between the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and the UKRI Medical Research Council (MRC), with further support from the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects five to eight per cent of school-age children worldwide and is associated with age-inappropriate problems with attention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that can impair everyday functioning. Stimulant medications improve symptoms in 70 per cent of those who take them in the short term but there is less evidence of their long-term effects.\n\nTo provide an alternative to medication researchers have developed and trialled approaches that use non-invasive stimulation of the brain, working on the regions that have been identified as influential in ADHD.\n\nOne of these approaches involves stimulating the trigeminal nerve (TNS), targeting a branch of this facial nerve which is thought to activate the brainstem and from there other brain regions that may be relevant to ADHD, in particular the locus coeruleus, which plays a role in arousal which is typically diminished in people with ADHD. TNS is thought to stimulate other brain regions associated with attention such as frontal and thalamic areas via the brainstem in a bottom-up manner.\n\nA previous small trial in the US with 62 children diagnosed with ADHD has shown that when TNS is applied every night for eight hours for one month it is effective in reducing symptoms – this research led to its clearance by the FDA for use in the US. However, the control condition involved no stimulation, and blinding was not tested after one month, raising questions about a potential placebo effect.\n\nThis new UK clinical trial across two sites in London and Southampton tested TNS in a wider range of 150 children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD aged between eight and 18 years old and applied a more rigorous placebo condition. Half of the sample received real TNS for about 9 hours every night for four weeks through battery-powered electrodes applied to the forehead. The other half of the sample received the ‘sham’ condition where electrodes were still applied to the forehead every night for four weeks but participants only received 30 seconds of stimulation every hour at a lower frequency and pulse width, which are thought to be non-effective and hence act as a “control” condition.\n\nOur study shows how important it is to design an appropriate placebo condition in clinical trials of brain therapies. There is a large placebo effect with high-tech brain therapies, in particular for patients and families that have an expectation that they can adjust brain differences associated with ADHD. It is hence paramount to control for placebo effects in modern brain therapies to avoid false hopes.\n\nDr Aldo Conti, postdoctoral researcher at IoPPN and at Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care, King’s College London and first author on the study said: “This multicentre trial was designed to address key limitations of the previous pilot study that informed FDA clearance of TNS for ADHD, particularly by using a rigorously controlled sham condition that supported successful blinding across the treatment period. Unlike the earlier study, which was limited to younger children, we also included adolescents, a clinically important group given well-documented challenges with long-term medication adherence. These design choices enabled a more robust and clinically relevant evaluation of TNS.”\n\nThe trial showed that TNS was safe with no serious adverse events and most participants considered it a mild or no burden to use. However, the results showed no significant change in ADHD symptoms, objective measures of hyperactivity, attention and associated behaviours around mood and sleep.\n\nProfessor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at University of Southampton and study lead for the Southampton site, stated: “Rigorous evidence, such as that generated by this study, is essential for supporting shared decision-making regarding interventions for ADHD. It empowers individuals with ADHD and their families to make informed choices about the treatment of ADHD. Clinicians, individuals with ADHD, and their families need to know which treatments work, and which do not based on the best evidence.”\n\nThe trial was run by the King’s Clinical Trials Unit and recruitment involved the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) clinics within the following NHS trusts: South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare (previously known as SOLENT NHS Trust), Central and North-West London NHS Foundation Trust, Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust and South-West London and St. George’s Mental Health NHS Trust.\n\nExternal trigeminal nerve stimulation in youth with ADHD: a randomized, sham-controlled, phase 2b trial by Conti, A.A. et al was published in Nature Medicine. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-04075-x\n\nProfessor of Cognitive Neuroscience\n\nPostdoctoral Research Associate",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's late January, and college football analysts are already predicting what next season may look like.\n\nFormer ESPN analyst David Pollack is already locked into the immediate future and is zeroing in on the five best teams he could see overtaking the preseason discussions come August.\n\nEven though the Indiana Hoosierswon the national championship against the Miami Hurricanes Monday night, Pollack opted not to put them in his personal preseason rankings.\n\nInstead, one of two Big Ten teams Pollack is dead set on rebounding is the Ohio State Buckeyes as his No. 2 team. The other is the Oregon Ducks at No. 3, who return quarterback Dante Moore.\n\nMORE: Indiana makes college football history, validates Big Ten dominance in national title win\n\n\"From what I saw from Julian Sayin [in 2025], I’ve 100 percent got Ohio State in my Top 5,\" Pollack said on \"See Ball Get Ball.\" \"Is 4 Jeremiah Smith still there? Ok, offense is going to be easy.  Bo Jackson is back, the offensive line is back.  Chris Henry Jr., I played with his dad; he looks like the next freak (at OSU), so that’s another 1-2 punch [at receiver]. They’re going to lose a lot of guys, but I trust Ohio State to be back in the Top 5.”\n\nLuckily for Pollack, every player he mentioned is projected to return to Columbus. The Buckeyes are only a year removed from winning a national title, so it certainly isn't out of the question for them to be back in the mix again this fall and for years to come.\n\nSimilar to other teams around the league, the Buckeyes are now trying to live up to the blueprint the Hoosiers have set for themselves after completing an undefeated season.\n\nEven though it's unclear if the Hoosiers can maintain this level of dominance, the Buckeyes certainly want to prove they can return to the top of college football.\n\nCome August, they'll have a clean slate to make it happen. Motivation or not, Pollack has the Texas Longhorns and quarterback Arch Manning as the team to beat in college football next season.\n\nMORE: Tom Brady, Raiders owner Mark Davis scout Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza at CFP title game\n\nBoth teams reunite in Austin next year for what should be a game to remember Saturday, Sept. 12.\n\nPaul Finebaum says what CFB community has thought about Indiana, Curt Cignetti all along\n\nJoel Klatt opens up about why Indiana football's national title win is 'exceedingly rare'\n\nCollege football analyst rips those in denial of Curt Cignetti's, Indiana's success\n\nTodd McShay delivers ultimate Indiana football blueprint for why it's sport's best team",

    "fullText": "The Oklahoma Sooners closed the 2025 season with a loss in the College Football Playoff to the Alabama Crimson Tide, a team they beat earlier in the season in Tuscaloosa. And the AP voters punished them for it, dropping the Sooners from No. 8 in the College Football Playoff rankings to No. 13 in the final AP Poll for 2025.\n\nOklahoma fell behind Alabama, Notre Dame, BYU, and Texas. The Crimson Tide were dominated by national champion Indiana in the Rose Bowl. Notre Dame opted out of the Pop Tarts Bowl, and BYU and Texas won their respective exhibition non-playoff games.\n\nThe Sooners may have finished the season with a loss, but proved they were one of the 10 best teams in college football in 2025. Alabama being in front of Oklahoma is understandable. So is Texas, since they beat the Sooners in the Red River Showdown. But it doesn't make sense to drop Oklahoma behind Notre Dame or BYU.\n\nNotre Dame shouldn't get rewarded for opting out of a bowl game cause they were sad they missed the playoff. BYU was proven even more fraudulent by Texas Tech's shutout loss to the Oregon Ducks. The Cougars' only losses on the season came to the Red Raiders, and BYU lost in decisive fashion.\n\nIt's just more disrespect for a Sooners team that earned its way into the No. 8 seed of the College Football Playoff by rattling off road wins over Tennessee and Alabama before beating Missouri and LSU with dominant defensive performances.\n\nOklahoma's been aggressive this offseason to upgrade their offense and retool their defense, and now the AP has provided fuel for the fire to make a return trip to the College Football Playoff in 2026.\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions.

    "description": "Penn State could have a bounce-back season in 2026 and may be on the College Football Playoff bubble according to this early ranking from On3.",
    "fullText": "With the book officially closed on the 2025 college football season and a new national champion having been crowned, it is now time to shift our focus to the 2026 college football season. It's never too early for that, right? As is typically the case when the season comes to a close, the tradition of way-too-early top-25 projections are making the rounds already, and one of the more interesting teams to scout on these lists will be Penn State.\n\nFollowing a program-changing 2025 season with an in-season coaching change and the hiring of Matt Campbell to steer the ship back on course, and with a massive offseason roster overhaul as a result, Penn State may be a difficult team for many to accurately project in the 2026 season. But that will not stop anyone from attempting to gauge where the Nittany Lions will be sitting next season. If one way-too-early top-25 list from On3 is any indication, Penn State could be on the College Football Playoff bubble next fall.\n\nOn3 released its way-too-early top-25 list and gave Penn State a No. 14 projection. Putting Penn State somewhere in the middle of any top-25 projection feels somewhat fair given the changes wiht the program and puts some trust in Campbell to turn things around from Penn State's 2025 season. It also feels like a pretty safe projection to suggest Penn State could be in the playoff hunt but may fall just outside of it.\n\nOhio State tops the On3 top-25 outlook, followed by Georgia, Texas, and Notre Dame, respectively. 2025 national champion Indiana takes the No. 5 slot in the On3 way-too-early top-25, with Oregon right behind the Hoosiers to give the Big Ten three top-10 teams in this projection. Michigan is the only other Big Ten team ranked ahead of Penn State, at No. 11.\n\nOther Big Ten teams ranked in On3's early projection are Washington (No. 18), USC (No. 19), and Iowa (No. 21). Penn State will play road games next season at Michigan and Washington and will host USC. The Nittany Lions will not face Ohio State, Indiana, or Oregon during the regular season in 2026. Also of note, On3 also ranks Virginia Tech, now coached by former Penn State head coach James Franklin, at No. 23.\n\nFollow Kevin McGuire on Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.\n\nFollow Nittany Lions Wire on X, Facebook, and Threads.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: Where Penn State ranks in On3's way-too-early top 25 for 2026 season",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCollege football tends to thrive on chaos.\n\nUpsets are what makes the sport so captivating at times — when a smaller school topples a national power, it reminds fans what they enjoy so much about the landscape of NCAA football. But while upsets are fun, there are sometimes teams that are simply too dominant to overcome.\n\nCollege football has had its share of teams to go unbeaten across an entire season, some of which also claimed a win in that year's national championship. Some undefeated squads didn't get the opportunity to play for the title, while others steamrolled their way to college football glory, whether in the College Football Playoff, Bowl Championship Series or other previous playoff systems.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of the history of undefeated college football teams, including national champions.\n\nMORE: Which teams have the most wins in college football history?\n\nWith college football having a complicated history within its structure, there a few ways to view the history of undefeated teams — regardless of whether they won a national championship or not. In total, there have likely been hundreds teams to finish a college football season unbeaten, but with varying circumstances, tiebreaker and playoff rules and number of games.\n\nPre-1900, when college football was still free of ties and informal with plenty of differing rules, the NCAA has 26 teams on-record to finish their season unbeaten and untied, per the NCAA's 2009 Division I records report, which included any teams with a minimum of five games against opponents above the high school level. From 1900 to 1936, the year the AP Poll was introduced, there were an additional 133 teams to finish a season unbeaten and untied.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1991, the year before the Bowl Coalition was created — helping to better establish a national champion and provide better-quality bowl matchups — the NCAA has 134 teams on-record to finish a season unbeaten and untied.\n\nFrom 1992-2013, which spans between the Bowl Coalition, Bowl Alliance and Bowl Championship Series eras of the postseason, the NCAA has 40 teams on-record to go unbeaten and untied.\n\nHowever, in terms of comparing college football teams, it's easiest to assess the unbeaten teams in the College Football Playoff era, since 2014. Because this playoff format is still used by the NCAA, allows top teams to go head-to-head in the playoff, and limits the number of unbeaten squads, it's the easiest way to assess a \"perfect\" team in recent history.\n\nIn the CFP era, there have been seven FBS teams to go unbeaten in a full season, six of which won the CFP championship. A 13-0 USF team in 2017, which was not selected to the playoff bracket, is the lone non-champion.\n\nTrimming the parameters from 1994-2025, which largely covers the most modern era of college football, there have been a total of 30 FBS teams to go undefeated in a season. Nebraska had three (1994, 1995, 1997), while 11 of those 30 teams did not with the national championship, for varying reasons.\n\nOverall, the history of unbeaten teams is a complicated one, especially when looking at non-national champions. With the CFP in place, the era of multiple undefeated teams in one season is virtually obsolete, helping to quiet those complications. For years, there were consistently undefeated teams that didn't get a shot at the championship, including 1998 Tulane, 2004 Auburn, 2006 Boise State, 2008 Utah and 2010 TCU.\n\nExamining the history of undefeated teams to win the national championship is a bit more defined — while there have been many college football teams to finish a season unbeaten, especially in the early eras of the sport, a more select few have gone unbeaten with a title.\n\nMORE: Most losses in college football history by school\n\nSince 1936, the year the Associated Press released its first Top 25 poll, there have been 64 NCAA-recognized undefeated college football champions. That includes co-title holders.\n\nNotre Dame has six of those perfect championship seasons, while Nebraska and Alabama both have five.\n\nHere's the list of every undefeated national champion, separated by era (CFP, BCS, pre-BCS), according to the NCAA.\n\nMORE:What to know about college football overtime rules\n\nIn January of 2026, Indiana became the most recent undefeated college football team.\n\nPrior to Indiana, the last college football team to finish a season undefeated was the Michigan Wolverines in 2023. Led by head coach John Harbaugh and quarterback J.J. McCarthy, the Big Ten squad went 15-0 and won the College Football Playoff championship over Washington. Michigan's 2023 season resulted in controversy over a sign-stealing scandal, however.\n\nHarbaugh, in his ninth season at Michigan, guided his team to a 12-0 regular season in 2023. The Wolverines then beat Iowa 26-0 in the Big Ten Championship game and took down Alabama 27-20 in overtime of the Rose Bowl, a CFP semifinal game. To win the national title, Michigan beat Washington 34-13, winning the 12 title in program history and first since 1997.\n\nMichigan became the first national champion to have a lead at halftime in every game it played since 2001 Miami. Harbaugh's unit also became the first-ever Big Ten team to go 15-0. Outside of McCarthy, key contributors included guard Zak Zinte, running back Blake Corum, tight end Colston Loveland, defensive lineman Mason Graham and cornerbacks Mike Sainristil and Will Johnson.\n\nThere were a few reasons for controversy around Michigan's 2023 season, though. For one, Harbaugh had been suspended by his university for the first three games of the season due to alleged recruiting violations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, in November of the 2023 season, a sign-stealing scandal became apparent that gained national interests.\n\nIn October 2023, the NCAA began Michigan's football program amid allegations of sign-stealing, the Big Ten announced. The Wolverines were being accused of in-person scouting of future opponents. In early November, staffer Connor Stalions resigned due to his role in the schemes, while Harbaugh was suspended by the Big Ten for the team's final three regular-season games for violating sportsmanship rules.\n\nEventually, the NCAA's investigation officially found in 2025 that Michigan's football program had \"committed violations involving an off-campus, in-person scouting scheme.\" Through interview testimonies, ticket receipts and transfer data and other evidence, Stalions was found to have made scouting violations.\n\n\"During the 2021, 2022 and 2023 football seasons, Stalions directed and arranged for individuals to conduct off-campus, in-person scouting of Michigan's future regular-season opponents. In doing so, Stalions purchased game tickets and transferred them to those individuals, who included another staff member, interns and acquaintances of Stalions. The network of individuals was referred to as the 'KGB.' While in attendance, they filmed the signal callers on the future opponents' sidelines and then provided that film to Stalions,\" the NCAA's report said. \"Using the footage they collected — which Stalions referred to as 'dirty film' — Stalions then deciphered opponents' signals. Stalions and other individuals involved in the scheme acknowledged or corroborated this process.\n\nAdditionally, on one occasion, Stalions personally attended a future opponent's contest. In total, 56 instances of off-campus, in-person scouting of 13 future regular- season opponents occurred across 52 contests.\"\n\nThe NCAA's report also said that Stalions had spent nearly $35,000 on tickets in 2022 alone for the scheme. It also reported that Stalions, Harbaugh, Sherrone Moore and former director of player personnel Denard Robinson all failed to meet \"expectations of cooperation\" in the investigation, ranging from \"destroying relevant materials\" to \"providing false and misleading information during interviews.\"\n\nPunishments for the scandal were also released by the NCAA. Then-Michigan head coach, Sherrone Moore, was suspended three games, Stalions received an eight-year show-cause penalty, Harbaugh received a 10-year show-cause, and a fine was expected to eclipse $30 million for the school, per ESPN.\n\nRegardless of that investigation and the noise in made in the college football world, the Wolverines continued their dominance into the CFP and completed a perfect season. After the title win, Harbaugh left the program to be the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers in the NFL, not dealing with many of the consequences that were handed to the program from the sign-stealing scandal.\n\nMORE:Explaining the 2025 Sherrone Moore scandal at Michigan\n\nTwo teams have gone 16-0 in college football history: Indiana in 2025 and Yale in 1984. While Yale football team accomplished the feat. in 1984, thought, there are plenty of reasons to take that feat with a bit of an asterisk.\n\nThere wasn't just no CFP or no officially recognized national champions in 1894 — there was minimal padding for players and no helmets. It was a much different sport in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\nSince then, there have been a number of teams to go 15-0, but going 16-0 often hasn't been a possibility due to the length of the regular season, or the playoff format. If you count the FCS, there has been one other 16-0 team: North Dakota State in 2019.\n\nWith the creation of the 12-team CFP in 2024, it became possible for an FBS team to play 16 games between the regular season, their conference championship and the playoff bracket. In January 2026, the Indiana Hoosiers joined 1894 Yale as the only 16-0 teams in college football history.\n\nMORE: The full list of biggest blowouts in CFP history",

    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Carson Beck was part of two national championship runs at Georgia.\n\nTo him, those seasons weren't as good as this one was for him at Miami.\n\nBeck's last pass as a college quarterback was an interception, one that essentially sealed Miami's fate in a 27-21 loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff national championship game on Monday night. He had to watch the Hoosiers celebrate on what was his home field, watch the turf littered in crimson-and-white confetti.\n\nAnd yet, when he reflected on the end of his journey, he declared this year at Miami the best of his life.\n\n“Yeah, it was,” Beck said after a 19-for-32 passing, 232-yard, one-touchdown, one-interception performance in the final. “And not because we made the national championship, not because won a bunch of football games or we made great plays or things of that sort. Man, for me, my whole entire life changed.\n\n\"You know, 365 days ago, I was in just a really dark place, and I was trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It was a really difficult thing. There was just a lot going on, mentally, physically, emotionally, to be able to battle and fight through the roller-coaster that life is.\"\n\nAt this time a year ago, Beck was no longer wanted at Georgia, his elbow had just been surgically rebuilt, every move of his personal life became social-media fodder and he knew the doubters were everywhere.\n\nHe almost got the last laugh. Beck started all 16 games for Miami, led the Hurricanes to a 13-3 mark and set a school record by completing 72.4% of his passes. The last pass was a bit underthrown, and there seemed to be some sort of miscommunication on the final play. (“Their defense played really well tonight,\" Beck said.) But Miami knew long before that play that without Beck, they wouldn't have gotten anywhere near the CFP title game.\n\n“He earned the respect of his teammates, teammates working hard with him,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “We win together, we lose together. Proud of him.”\n\nBeck was at Miami for one year. He made clear after his final college game that whatever the future brings, he'll have the Hurricanes to thank.\n\n“I really couldn’t have done it without all these people around me,” Beck said. “This university truly saved me and helped me rebuild into the man that I am today.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS — The field was covered in red-and-white confetti, and the Heisman Trophy quarterback was covered in bruises. The college football season had just come down to the very final minute, and a team of perpetual sorrow was dancing toward glory.\n\nThis is what it looks like when reality surpasses fantasy.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana, emerging from a century of gloom, won the College Football Playoff national championship game, 27-21, against No. 10 Miami on Monday night in what feels like a seismic shift in possibilities for forgotten programs everywhere.\n\nWere they watching Monday night in Starkville, Mississippi?\n\nHow about in Ames, Iowa? Maybe even in the shadow of a new campus stadium in Tampa?\n\n“We’re 16-0 and national champions at Indiana University,” head coach Curt Cignetti said. “I know a lot of people thought that was never possible. It’s probably one of the greatest sports stories of all time.”\n\nThe Hoosiers, a team that had not won a conference championship in nearly 60 years and was more than 200 games below .500 before Cignetti arrived in 2024, went 16-0 and won the national championship just two years after going 3-9. If that kind of turnaround is possible in the new world of college football, can any dream be considered too outlandish in the days to come?\n\nQuarterback Fernando Mendoza, who grew up just miles from Hard Rock Stadium and was all but ignored by his beloved University of Miami as a Columbus High senior, played a virtually flawless game despite a fierce pass rush from the Hurricanes.\n\n“Tonight is going to be an insane night,” Mendoza said during the onfield trophy presentation. “I can’t wait to get back to Bloomington with the guys.”\n\nThere was nothing accidental about what Indiana accomplished this season. The record was perfect, and it was absolutely a reflection of the team’s play.\n\nThe Hoosiers were disciplined (fifth in the nation in penalties per game), they were explosive (second in points per game), they were stingy (second in points allowed per game) and they were smart (first in turnover margin).\n\nThey beat defending national champion Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game, and then crushed Alabama and Oregon by a combined 94-25 in their first two playoff games. All that stood in Indiana’s way was a Miami team that defied projections with upsets of higher-seeded teams in the first two rounds of the playoffs before dispatching Ole Miss in the semifinals.\n\nThe Hoosiers controlled the ball and frustrated the Hurricanes in the first half, and then came up with clutch plays on offense and special teams in the second half as Miami staged a furious comeback.\n\nAnd, in the end, Indiana’s fearlessness was the difference.\n\nAfter Miami had cut the lead to 17-14, the Hoosiers answered with a touchdown drive for the ages. It wasn’t that they held the ball for 12 plays or that they traveled 75 yards. It was that Cignetti put faith in his quarterback on a fourth and 5 instead of punting from the Miami 37, and then again on fourth down from the Miami 4. On the first conversion, Mendoza hit Charlie Becker on a 19-yard, back-shoulder completion. That was just the appetizer.\n\nOn fourth down from the 4, Indiana initially called the field-goal unit on the field. After a timeout, Cignetti sent the offense back out and Mendoza, on a quarterback draw, bounced off defenders and dove into the endzone for the touchdown.\n\n“They called that play and we knew, ‘Hey, we’re going to bet on ourselves one more time in the biggest (moment) of the game,’” Mendoza said.\n\nIn a way, this is what so many fans wanted. A college football postseason with the suspense of an NCAA basketball tournament.\n\nAlabama, Clemson, Georgia and Ohio State had become as ubiquitous in January as Dick Clark and Times Square. From 2014-22, there was not a single national championship game without at least one of those teams. And six of those games included some variation of two of those programs playing each other.\n\nThat’s the hierarchy the transfer portal torched. And this is the future that name, image and likeness money has begat.\n\nMiami, on Monday night, was playing in a national title game for the first time in 23 years. The last time Indiana had even a whiff of national title consideration was when the Hoosiers lost 14-3 to No. 1 USC in the 1968 Rose Bowl and finished No. 4 in the final Associated Press poll.\n\nIt’s a new era of college football.\n\nIt’s not perfect, by any means. It’s not beloved by traditionalists aghast with players jumping from school to school, and it’s practically blasphemous for programs accustomed to sitting atop the mountaintop.\n\nBut, as the 2025 season demonstrated, there is something exhilarating about the unknown. Something thrilling about new faces and stories.\n\nSomething remarkable about a program that could endure 26 losing seasons in 30 years and, with a new coach on board, emerge to go 27-2 across his first two seasons and win a national championship.\n\nWelcome to the new world order.\n\nJohn Romano can be reached at jromano@tampabay.com.

    "fullText": "Carson Beck will have plenty of fond memories to look back on from his college football career.\n\nBut it ended Monday in heartbreak.\n\nWith a chance to lead Miami on a drive for its sixth national championship, Beck threw an interception that sealed Indiana's first. His intended target on the play, Keelan Marion, never saw the ball in the air.\n\nWith the clock ticking under two minutes, Miami's defense held Indiana to a field goal that gave the Hoosiers a 27-21 lead. Beck then led the offense onto the field with 1:42 remaining, in need of a touchdown that could seal a national title on Miami's home field.\n\nMiami overcame a delay of game penalty before the first snap with a pair of first downs that put them over midfield. The first first down of the drive arrived courtesy of a roughing the passer penalty that resulted in the back of Beck's head hitting the turf.\n\nWith the Hurricanes facing first and 10 at the Indiana 41, Beck decided to go for it all with 51 seconds remaining. Marion ran a go route down the left sideline, facing man coverage from cornerback Jamari Sharpe and safety help over the top.\n\nBeck launched a deep ball that never stood a chance.\n\njamari sharpe game sealing interception; miami vs indiana pic.twitter.com/ceKYojVw14\n\n— ◇ (@F0RGIAT0) January 20, 2026\n\nThe ball was short and thrown into double coverage. Sharpe pinpointed it for an interception at the 15-yard line as Marion continued to run toward the end zone.\n\nWith Miami out of timeouts, all that was left for the Hoosiers to clinch the national championship was to run out the clock. They did just that for a 27-21 win.\n\nAnd Beck will finish his college career with two national championships as a backup at Georgia, but none as a starter.\n\nThe turnover was the first of the night for either team on a night when Beck completed 19 of 32 passes for 232 yards with 1 touchdown and the late interception.\n\nBeck was asked after the game how he was feeling on the last drive after the roughing-the-passer hit.\n\n\"My ears are ringing,\" Beck said, per ESPN's Pete Thamel.\n\nBeck also spoke with reporters about the game-sealing interception.\n\nHere’s Carson Beck explaining the final interception. pic.twitter.com/COIrwqYO4C\n\n— Clay Ferraro (@ClayWPLG) January 20, 2026\n\n\"The guy made a really good play,\" Beck said. \"They were in cover 2 and he sunk with no flat threat, made a really good play on the ball.\n\n\"So again, a lot of credit to them and their defense. They played really, really well tonight.\"\n\nPer Thamel, Marion was in tears in the postgame locker room with a towel over his head. He said that the interception was his \"mistake\" and that he didn't realize that Beck had thrown the pass.\n\n\"I didn't even know he had threw the ball,\" Marion said. ... “I got to look for the ball and make that play for him. So that's all on me.”\n\nHere's a look at the Marion's route from the sideline near the end zone. Marion didn't look back for the ball until he crossed the 20-yard line after Sharpe had made his break on the ball. By then, it was too late.\n\nI see what Carson Beck saw here. Why is Keelan Marion running with his head down? I really don’t understand. pic.twitter.com/XopqjBbpVp\n\n— Miami Hurricanes 2026 National Champs 🏆 (@nijayforeverlit) January 20, 2026\n\nThe interception concludes a college career for Beck that started at Georgia in 2020 and featured five seasons including a redshirt campaign with the Bulldogs before he utilized his extra Covid-19 season to transfer to Miami.\n\nMiami didn't win the ACC with Beck at quarterback, but was granted a controversial berth in the College Football Playoff. Beck and the Hurricanes ultimately proved the selection committee correct by winning three playoff games to advance to Monday's championship game.\n\nThey had a chance at the end to upset a historic Indiana team that surged to the top of college football with dominant units on both sides of the ball following decades of irrelevance.\n\nIt's a lot to be proud of. But it's not likely to soothe the pain of how Monday's championship game was lost at the end.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThis year's College Football Playoff championship game is unlike any other.\n\nIndiana is not only playing for a title, but is decisively favored to win a title. A Hoosiers victory would complete one of the all-time great turnarounds in sports history, as they went just 7-27 in the three seasons prior to coach Curt Cignetti's arrival in Bloomington.\n\nLIVE:Follow Miami vs. Indiana updates from 2026 CFP championship game\n\nMiami is quite an underdog story as well. While the Hurricanes have an expensive roster, they entered the playoff as the No. 10 seed and had to win twice as an underdog before handling business against Ole Miss in the semifinal. A win for Mario Cristobal's squad would complete an improbable run that began with a surprise inclusion in the 12-team bracket in early December.\n\nThe national championship game includes plenty of new faces, but one very familiar face could be in attendance.\n\nHere's what you need to know about U.S. president Donald Trump's whereabouts for the College Football Playoff championship game.\n\nMORE CFP CHAMPIONSHIP GAME NEWS:\n\nExpert prediction of Indiana-Miami final\n\nHow Mario Cristobal, Miami have become clutch\n\nCurt Cignetti's past meets his future in semis\n\nRoster breakdown: Who has more blue-chippers?\n\nWhy Miami gets to keep all CFP revenue\n\nIs Indiana better than Joe Burrow-led LSU?\n\nMiami's run has a March Madness feel\n\n7:45 p.m.: The president is in the house.

On Monday afternoon, the White House's official X account posted about him going to the game:\n\nNATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP ON THE LINE.\n\nPresident Trump will be in attendance for the College Football Playoff National Championship TONIGHT. 🏆 pic.twitter.com/4TgbXAJx1Q\n\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 19, 2026\n\n%3Cscript%20async%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.twitter.com%2Fwidgets.js%22%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E\n\nEarlier Monday, Trump released a presidential message commemorating the College Football Playoff championship game.\n\n\"Tonight, the College Football Playoff National Championship brings a season of dedication, sacrifice, and hard work to a climactic conclusion.  It stands as the final measure of months of preparation, resolve, and competition that have long defined college football—a beloved and uniquely American tradition,\" Trump said, adding, \"Melania and I congratulate the Indiana Hoosiers and the Miami Hurricanes on making it to the College Football Playoff National Championship.\"\n\nTrump previously attended the national championship game in 2018, when Alabama won an overtime thriller over Georgia, and in 2020, when Joe Burrow and LSU finished off a historically dominant season against Clemson.\n\nMORE:What made Fernando Mendoza college football's model QB\n\nTrump has been a frequent fan at college football games during his political career. Indiana vs. Miami would be the 12th college football game he has attended since he was elected to his first term in 2016, and it would be the eighth he's attended as a sitting president.\n\nIn addition to attending the Army-Navy Game in December, Trump attended a Washington Commanders game against the Detroit Lions late in the NFL season and even made an appearance in the Fox broadcast booth. Last year, Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl.\n\nMiami, where Monday's game will be played, is a particularly convenient location for Trump because he has a residence at Mar-a-Lago in nearby Fort Lauderdale. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago on Friday and stayed there through the weekend, but he is set to return to the White House after the game.\n\nTrump is expected to attend the game with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who graduated from law school at Miami and represented Florida in the U.S. senate before being nominated to join Trump's cabinet.",

    "fullText": "As ESPN readies to air the College Football Playoff National Championship game, the sports network is announcing plans for a documentary series on the coach who has won more national championships than anyone else – Nick Saban.\n\nThe six-part series titled Saban, from ESPN and Word + Pictures, is directed by Russell Dinallo and produced by Words + Pictures’ Connor Schell, Libby Geist, Aaron Cohen, and Alexa Conway along with Tom Rinaldi, with Gabe Honig serving as co-executive producer and showrunner. It will document the man who won seven college football national championships – one at LSU and six at the University of Alabama.\n\nCollege Football Playoff National Championship: How To Watch Indiana Vs. Miami On TV & Online\n\nNFL Playoffs Schedule: How To Watch All Divisional Round Games Live Online & On TV\n\nDish Countersues Disney In Fight Over Sling TV Passes\n\nWatch a teaser for the Saban series below.\n\n“The series will peel back the curtain on the long closely guarded world of Saban,” notes a release, “with hundreds of hours of never-before-seen footage from the locker room and practice fields, as well as many other behind-the-scenes moments in his career at Alabama, and prior to that LSU, the Miami Dolphins, and Michigan State among other stops. There’s also a wealth of present-day interviews with Saban and his wife, the legendary Ms. Terry Saban, whose own influence and impact played a massive role in Nick’s success as a coach and leader.”\n\nSaban retired two years ago from Alabama and now serves as an ESPN analyst – as well as a pitchman for Aflac and Vrbo.\n\n“With my coaching days behind me, Ms. Terry and I have been doing a lot of reflection and realized we were ready to tell our story,” Nick Saban said. “The team at Words + Pictures has encouraged me to really look back not just at my time at Alabama, but every stop along the way – and not just reflect on what happened but consider the process which made it happen. I interacted with a lot of players and coaches along the way and I’m happy to see that so many of them have contributed to this docuseries. There’s a lot to tell, and I’m excited to share it all.”\n\nIn addition to his national titles, Saban’s football programs produced four Heisman Trophy winners and innumerable NFL stars. ESPN says the series will include “more than 30 hours of interviews with Saban, and more than 80 interviews with former players, assistant coaches, rivals, family, friends, and observers, the series offers a rare look at how he became the most successful and influential figure that the game of college football has ever known.”\n\n“There will never be another Nick Saban,” observed Connor Schell, CEO of Words + Pictures. “He’s a football genius, a singular leader, and a true icon who has done more than anyone to shape the modern game of college football and the culture around it. When you work with Coach Saban, you’re constantly reminded how every small detail matters and, in his case, that attention to detail and process has added up to an incredible journey and legacy. Working with Coach Saban and Ms. Terry has been a tremendous experience, and we can’t wait to share their story with the world.”\n\nESPN says the premiere date and full rollout plans for the series will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Grammys, Tonys & More",

    "fullText": "While college football is set to crown its national championship on Monday, Jan. 19 after Indiana's game against Miami, the race for men's college basketball's ultimate prize is heating up about two months before the start of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIn a week, the number of undefeated teams in the sport dwindled from five to three, with No. 2 Iowa State and No. 8 Vanderbilt both suffering two losses. The Cyclones were blown out 84-63 on the road by Kansas before following that up with a 79-70 setback at Cincinnati four days later. The Commodores, meanwhile, lost by 16 on the road against Texas and fell 98-94 at home to reigning national champion Florida.\n\nNo. 1 Arizona continued its perfect start to the season, moving to 18-0 with wins against rival Arizona State and at UCF. No. 10 Nebraska, the only other unbeaten team from a power conference, also kept its unblemished record intact, drubbing Oregon and Northwestern by a combined 54 points.\n\nREQUIRED READING: NCAA tournament bracketology: Race for No. 1 seed leads March Madness projection\n\nThen there's the nation's unlikeliest undefeated squad, Miami (Ohio), which moved to 19-0 thanks to a 105-102 overtime thriller over Buffalo.\n\nWill it be enough to get the RedHawks ranked? And how will results elsewhere in the country affect the newest batch of national rankings?\n\nHere's a look at the updated USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll and AP Top 25 for men's college basketball:\n\nFirst-place votes are in parentheses.\n\nOthers receiving votes: Iowa 52; Wisconsin 20; Miami (Ohio) 19; Utah State 14; Villanova 10; Tennessee 10; Saint Mary's 9; Miami (FL) 8; Texas A&M 5; Kentucky 5; SMU 4; Seton Hall 2; UCF 1; George Mason 1\n\nOthers receiving votes: Wisconsin 64; St. John's 64; Iowa 30; Kentucky 27; Tennessee 20; Utah State 15; UCF 14; Miami 10; George Mason 10; Saint Mary's 5; SMU 3; Villanova 3; Texas A&M 2; NC State 1\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Men's college basketball rankings: Updated Coaches Poll, AP Top 25",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWay-Too-Early Top 25 lists do serve a purpose.\n\nWe get the same push-back every year. How could you possibly rank teams this early with NIL and the transfer portal increasing volatility from year to year in the 12-team College Football Playoff era?\n\nUseless? Nah. This is a useful exercise as a baseline for the 2026-27 college football season.\n\nIt's fun to take a swing at what next season might look like, too.\n\nWe had Penn State, Clemson and LSU in the top 10 on this list last season, and it didn't work out. So what? We also had five of the 10 P4 playoff teams, and two \n\nNo. 1 Indiana plays for the CFP championship on Monday against No. 10 Miami. We had the Hoosiers at No. 10 and Hurricanes at No. 20 in 2025, and it's hard to read both teams given the number of experienced players both teams will lose. It's as combustible as ever after the transfer portal quarterback shuffle, and Sporting News Way Too Early Top 25 reflects that.\n\nThere will be changes before August – and we anticipate this could get nuked by the end of September next season. Guess what? That is the fun part.\n\nMORE CFP CHAMPIONSHIP GAME NEWS:\n\nExpert prediction of Indiana-Miami final\n\nCurt Cignetti's past meets his future in semis\n\nRoster breakdown: Who has more blue-chippers?\n\nWhy Miami gets to keep all CFP revenue\n\nIs Indiana better than Joe Burrow-led LSU?\n\nMiami's run has a March Madness feel\n\nWhy would we doubt Curt Cignetti? The Hoosiers will have heavy losses to the 2026 NFL Draft – including potential No. 1 pick Fernando Mendoza – but Indiana will combine returners such as receiver Charlie Becker and defensive tackle Rolijah Hardy with another strong portal class. TCU quarterback Josh Hoover (3,472 yards, 29 TDs, 13 INTs), Boston College running back Turbo Richard (749 yards, 9 TDs), Michigan State receiver Nick Marsh (662 yards, 6 TDs) and Kansas State edge rusher Tobi Osunsanmi (4 sacks) lead the changes. Indiana had a top-25 recruiting class, too. Ohio State and USC visit Memorial Stadium this year.\n\nMORE: Curt Cignetti's past met its future during College Football Playoff\n\nOhio State coach Ryan Day still has yet to name a new offensive coordinator after Brian Hartline left for South Florida. Defensive coordinator Matt Patricia is back to run what will be a re-tooled defense led by defensive lineman Kenyatta Jackson Jr.  Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin (3,610 yards, 32 TDs, 8 INTs), running back Bo Jackson (1,090 yards, 6 TDs) and receiver Jeremiah Smith (1,243 yards, 12 TDs) return on offense. Five-star freshman Chris Henry Jr. also should make an instant impact. The schedule is high level with road trips to Texas, Iowa, USC and Indiana and home games against Oregon and Michigan.\n\nThe Bulldogs won back-to-back SEC championships under coach Kirby Smart – and quarterback Gunner Stockton returns after a solid first season as a starter. Tackle Monroe Freeling and linebacker CJ Allen declared for the NFL Draft, but running back Nate Frazier (947 yards, 6 TDs) and tackle Earnest Greene are back. Linebacker Raylen Wilson and safety KJ Bolden will be anchors for a solid defense. Road trips to Alabama (Oct. 10) and Ole Miss (Nov. 7) are the marquee games on the schedule.\n\nMORE: Transfer portal winners and losers\n\nArch Manning returns at quarterback, and so does the preseason hype. He will have a loaded group of receivers with Ryan Wingo, Emmett Mosley V and Auburn transfer Cam Coleman – who had 13 TD receptions the last two seasons. Arizona State transfer running back Raleek Brown (1,141 yards, 4) and NC State transfer back  offset Hollywood Smothers (939 yards, 6 TDs) the loss of leading rusher Tre Wisner. Will the Longhorns' offensive line be better? They nabbed Wake Forest's starting left tackle Melvin Siani just before the portal closed. Pitt linebacker Rasheem Biles and Florida State linebacker Justin Cryer add to the defense – which welcomes the return of defensive coordinator Will Muschamp. The Longhorns have a return home game against Ohio State (Sept. 12), and the SEC schedule does not offer many breaks.\n\nHow will the Irish respond to this year's playoff snub under coach Marcus Freeman, who is 43-12 since taking over as head coach? Quarterback CJ Carr – who had 2,751 yards, 24 TDs and six interceptions – is a Heisman Trophy contender. Running back Aneyas Williams and receivers Jaden Greathouse and Jordan Faison should work behind an experienced offensive line. Ohio State transfer wide receiver Quincy Porter is a nice addition. All-American cornerback Leonard Moore is back along with senior linebacker Drayk Bowen. Notre Dame opens with Wisconsin (Sept. 6) at Lambeau Field, and the home matchup with Miami (Nov. 7) will be huge.\n\nMORE: Marcus Freeman choosing ND shows college sports aren't doomed\n\nDante Moore (3,565 yards, 30 TDs, 10 INTs) returns at starting quarterback for the Ducks, and Nebraska transfer Dylan Raiola also is in the QB room. That's a fantastic start for coach Dan Lanning, who replaces coordinators Will Stein and Tosh Lupoi with Drew Mehringer and Chris Hampton. The defense added Minnesota safety Koi Perich – one of the most-exciting players in college football. The Ducks have settled in the Big Ten as an every-year contender, and the schedule features matchups against Ohio State, Michigan and USC.\n\nTexas Tech isn't done yet after making its first CFP appearance under Joey McGuire. The Red Raiders landed Cincinnati quarterback Brendan Sorsby – who had 2,800 passing yards, 28 TDs and seven interceptions. Auburn transfer Malcolm Simmons averaged 18.3 yards per catch. The defense loses impact players such as Jacob Rodriguez, David Bailey and Lee Hunter – so there is work to do to replicate that dominance from 2025. San Diego State edge rusher Trey White – who had 19.5 sacks the last two seasons – and Kansas State transfer Austin Romaine – who has 184 career tackles – should help.\n\nMORE: Brendan Sorsby tops SN's transfer portal QB rankings\n\nThe Hurricanes enjoyed the long-awaited break-through to a CFP championship game under Mario Cristobal, but there will likely be heavy losses from a veteran roster starting at quarterback with Carson Beck. Miami stole Darian Mensah away from Duke just before the CFP championship game. Receiver Malachi Toney and defensive tackle Justin Scott are back – but there will be some interesting roster decisions after the CFP championship game.\n\nCan Brent Venables get Oklahoma back to the College Football Playoff? Quarterback John Mateer, receiver Isaiah Sategna and leading tackler Kip Lewis are returning, but 26 players have entered the portal. Texas receiver Parker Livingstone is a solid pickup, and Michigan linebacker Cole Sullivan adds to a defense that also returns defensive tackle David Stone, Peyton Bowen and Eli Bowen. Oklahoma plays at Michigan (Sept. 12) and Georgia (Sept. 26) in the first month.\n\nHow will Pete Golding navigate his first full season as head coach? Dynamic quarterback Trinidad Chambliss is suing the NCAA to be eligible for another season. If Chambliss is denied, then Auburn transfer quarterback Deuce Knight would likely be the starter. Running back Kewan Lacy (1,567 yards, 24 TDs) is back, and the Rebels did not have a massive exodus in the portal. LSU visits Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on Sept. 19 in Lane Kiffin's return.\n\nThe Cougars are 23-4 the last two seasons. Quarterback Bear Bachmeier and Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year LJ Martin are back from a team that was on the cusp of the College Football Playoff, but the Cougars will have to replace receiver Chase Roberts and BYU added four tackles – including USC's Walker Lyons – via the transfer portal. Linebacker Isaiah Glasker and safety Faleatu Satuala are the key returners on defense. Utah and Notre Dame are the marquee games on the schedule.\n\nThis will be a telling third year for Kalen DeBoer. Ty Simpson declared for the NFL Draft, meaning the quarterback competition between Austin Mack and Keelon Russell is front and center. The Crimson Tide have 20 players who left via the transfer portal, and running back Daniel Hill and receiver Ryan Williams are key returners – but the offense line will need to be rebuilt again. Safety Brady Hubbard is back on defense. Early-season home games against Florida State (Sept. 19) and Georgia (Oct. 10) will be a good gauge for where the Crimson Tide stand.\n\nThird-year coach Mike Elko can build off a CFP appearance. Quarterback Marcel Reed ranked fifth in the SEC with 3,169 passing yards. Reuben Owens III returns and will take on a lead role at running back, and Alabama transfer receiver Isaiah Horton is a key addition. The defense will have to replace the production from All-American Cashius Howell – and the schedule is tougher this time with road trips to LSU (Sept. 26), Alabama (Oct. 24) and Oklahoma (Nov. 24) before the home finale against Texas (Nov. 27).\n\nThe Trojans are 16-10 since joining the Big Ten, and this is another prove-it year for Lincoln Riley. Quarterback Jayden Maiava returns. He ranked fourth in the FBS with 3,711 passing yards. The Trojans also brought in the top recruiting class in the country. Defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn left for Penn State, however, and the Trojans lost 20 players in the transfer portal. Trips to Indiana and Penn State and home games against Ohio State and Oregon are the highlights.\n\nMorgan Scalley takes over for longtime coach Kyle Whittingham, and the Utes should be right back in the mix in the Big 12 race. Quarterbacks Devin Damper and Byrd Ficklin both return, and leading rusher Wayshawn Parker (981 yards, 6 TDs) is back. Safety Tao Johnson is a top returner on defense. Utah closed the season with six straight victories and averaged 46.5 points per game. Will that momentum carrry over with Scalley?\n\nWhittingham takes over at Michigan after Sherrone Moore was fired. New offensive coordinator Jason Beck will get to work with quarterback Bryce Underwood, who had 2,418 yards, 11 TDs and nine interceptions as a freshman. Jordan Marshall and five-star freshman Savion Hiter from a strong backfield, and Texas transfer Jamie Ffrench adds to the receiver room. Utah edge rusher John Henry Daley – who had 11.5 sacks – is a portal prize. The Wolverines play Oklahoma on Sept. 12 and face Indiana, Oregon and Ohio State in Big Ten play.\n\nHow will Lane Kiffin fare in Year 1 at LSU? The “Portal King” reeled in Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt and nine receivers via the transfer portal. Running back Caden Durham also is back. Linebacker Whit Weeks returns to what should be a healthier defense, and Boise State safety Ty Benefield will be a star in this defense.  September features the home opener at Clemson (Sept. 5), Kiffin's return to Ole Miss (Sept. 19) and a home game against Texas A&M (Sept. 26).\n\nPenn State hired Matt Campbell, and 22 players from Iowa State followed him to Happy Valley, including veteran quarterback Rocco Becht (2,584 yards, 16 TDs, 9 INTs). It's an overhaul at almost every position, and the running back room features Iowa State's Carson Hansen and Ohio State transfer James Peoples. We trust Campbell, but this feels like a transition season despite a friendly schedule that does not include Indiana, Ohio State or Oregon.\n\nThis could be Jeff Brohm's best team if Ohio State transfer Lincoln Kienholz takes command of the starting quarterback job. Running backs Isaac Brown (884 yards, 7 TDs) and Keyjuan Brown (704 yards, 6 TDs) are back, and edge rusher Clev Lubin (8.5 sacks, 13.5 TFLs) also returns. Brohm has 27 players coming in via the portal, including Vanderbilt receiver Tre Richardson (806 yards, 7 TDs). The Cardinals have a showcase opener against Ole Miss (Sept. 5) at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nIowa is in its customary spot under long-time coach Kirk Ferentz in these rankings. Wake Forest transfer Jeremy Hecklinski and Hank Brown will battle for the starting QB job. Kamari Moulton returns at running back, and Kade Pieper will anchor the offensive line. Zach Lutmer (71 tackles, 3 INTs) leads the defense. Iowa State, Ohio State, Nebraska and Wisconsin all visit Kinnick Stadium. The Hawkeyes have finished between No. 16 and No. 25 six of the last eight seasons.\n\nThe Cougars are a legit Big 12 sleeper contender under coach Willie Fritz. Quarterback Conner Weigman, Oregon transfer running back Makhi Hughes and receiver Amare Thomas – who had 966 yards and 12 TDs – lead the offense. Five-star quarterback Keisean Henderson could get opportunities too. Tulane guard Shadre Hurst – a second-team SN All-America pick – beefs up the offensive line. The defense has to replace its top two tacklers. A road trip to Texas Tech could be the best game on the Big 12 schedule.\n\nThe Illini are 19-7 the last two seasons under Bret Bielema. Luke Altmyer is gone, and East Carolina transfer Katin Houser is a solid replacement. A supporting cast of running back Caa'Lil Valentine (614 yards, 4 TDs) and receivers Collin Dixon (548 yards, 5 TDs) and Hudson Clement (454 yards, 3 TDs) is back. The defense will have to replace the production left by edge rusher Gabe Jacas. Illinois faces Duke (Sept. 12) early, and the Big Ten schedule features matchups against Oregon and at Ohio State.\n\nSMU is 20-7 with a CFP appearance under Rhett Lashlee since joining the ACC. Quarterback Kevin Jennings returns for his senior season. The Mustangs picked up East Carolina receiver Yanick Smith (583 yards, 5 TDs) via the portal. SMU plays at Notre Dame, and the conference schedule is favorable outside of a trip to Louisville. The Mustangs will be right back in the ACC championship hunt.\n\nDemond Williams (3,065 passing yards, 25 TDs, 8 INTs) is returning at quarterback for Washington after a brief interlude with LSU. He also had 611 rushing yards and six TDs. Oregon running back Jayden Limar is a portal find who replaces Adam Mohamed, who transferred to Cal. Coach Jedd Fisch reeled in a top-10 recruiting class, too. Washington has home games with Indiana and Penn State and road tests at Oregon and USC.\n\nWill Eddie Robinson Coach of the year Clark Lea capitalize on the momentum created by Diego Pavia and All-American tight end Eli Stowers in 2025? Five-star freshman quarterback Jared Curtis is up next, and the Commodores added 16 players via the transfer portal. Clemson safety Ricardo Jones joins CJ Heard in the secondary, and linebacker Bryan Longwell – who has 70 tackles – also returns. The Commodores won't surprise anybody this year – and the matchups with Georgia (Oct. 3) and Alabama (Nov. 14) will tell the tale.\n\nManny Diaz led the Blue Devils to an ACC championship this season, but losing Mensah is a huge blow, especially with backup Henry Belin IV also gone. Running back Nate Sheppard – who had 1,132 yards and 11 TDs – also returns. Duke added 14 players via the transfer portal. The Blue Devils should be one of the best offenses in the ACC, and an early-season game at Illinois (Sept. 12) is a good barometer for success.\n\nDo you believe James Franklin can guide a quick turn-around at Virginia Tech? He flipped several Nittany Lions' recruits and brought 12 Penn State players from the transfer portal, and that includes quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer. This might be a year early, especially with a schedule that includes road trips to Clemson, SMU and Miami.",

    "fullText": "Miami will be playing for a national championship on its home field Monday night as it squares off against the Indiana Hoosiers in Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nThe Hurricanes are one of the most dominant college football programs of the last 50 years, and they are looking to add their sixth national title in this game. However, to an entire generation of college football fans, Miami's appearance in a CFP title game is anything but typical.\n\nThe national title drought for the Hurricanes has lasted 24 years, as they last claimed a trophy during the 2001 season. Miami hasn't even played for a national title since the 2002 season — in which it lost to Ohio State in overtime on a now-infamous pass interference penalty.\n\nThe decades since have not been kind to the Hurricanes. They won 11 games the following year in 2003, but that was the last double-digit win total until a 10-win season under Mark Richt in 2017. After that, the 'Canes didn't reach double-digit wins again until 2024 under Mario Cristobal, who has now won 23 games over the last two campaigns.\n\nMiami football is inarguably \"back,\" and a win over the Hoosiers to claim its sixth national championship would only further solidify that fact.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: When was Miami football's last national championship appearance?",

On Monday night, millions will watch the crimson of the Hoosiers clash with the all-white Hurricanes.\n\nAlthough the game is played at Miami's home turf, Hard Rock Stadium, the Hurricanes are technically the away team.\n\nThere are many significant storylines entering this game, but none more unique than the fact that this year's National Championship game will mark the first time in history that both schools are Adidas-branded.\n\nThis year's national championship is the first all-Adidas matchup in the title game.\n\nIt will be the first Adidas branded team to win a national title since Tennessee in 1998. pic.twitter.com/hnq9di2V4r\n\n— The Next Round (@NextRoundLive) January 13, 2026\n\nNo matter the outcome, this will be the first Adidas-branded school to win a national title since 1998, when the Tennessee Volunteers won it all.\n\nThe Sporting News has all you need to know about Indiana and Miami's uniform threads for the 2026 CFP National Championship game.\n\nMORE CFP CHAMPIONSHIP GAME NEWS:\n\nExpert prediction of Indiana-Miami final\n\nCurt Cignetti's past meets his future in semis\n\nRoster breakdown: Who has more blue-chippers?\n\nIs Indiana better than Joe Burrow-led LSU?\n\nMiami's run has a March Madness feel\n\nWhile the Hoosiers team and fanbase will have to travel to Miami, they have been deemed the home team.

Indiana has not been defeated this season while wearing these uniforms; in fact, they haven't lost a game in any uniform.\n\nThe first edition of the Adidas uniforms dates back to 2004, though many tweaks have been made over the last 22 years. In 2024, Indiana extended their partnership with Adidas, which will run until 2034.\n\nIt might be confusing, but even though the Hurricanes will be playing at home, they have been designated the away team.

The significance of this for those who are superstitious, Miami has not lost a game this season in these uniforms. In fact, they are 5-0 on the season and wore the same all-whites in their playoff wins over Texas A&M and Ohio State.\n\nDespite this being an \"away\" game, it will feel anything but that for the Hurricanes. The university put out a statement to those planning on attending, encouraging the Hurricanes faithful to wear orange.\n\nThis will undoubtedly produce a striking contrast with the all-white uniforms on the field.",

    "description": "Eryn Bostwick said that her high student-loan payments have prevented her from moving forward with IVF treatment.",
    "fullText": "College was always the goal for Eryn Bostwick.\n\nAs a first-generation college student, Bostwick, 37, said her parents wanted to ensure she had the opportunities they didn't have, and they believed that earning a college degree would provide her with financial stability.\n\nBostwick's parents weren't wrong — data show that a four-year college degree leads to higher earnings than a high school diploma. However, to accomplish that goal, Bostwick had to take out student loans and Pell grants. She said she wasn't fully aware of the long-term ramifications of the debt.\n\nShe now has just over $55,000 in student loan debt, which she accrued while pursuing a bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. at public universities with the goal of becoming a college professor. As a result, she's put off major life decisions, like adding to her family.\n\n\"I've always been very careful about when I would feel comfortable bringing a child into this world,\" Bostwick told Business Insider.\n\nIn vitro fertilization, or IVF, was the only way Bostwick could have a child due to existing medical conditions. While Bostwick and her husband were able to afford the initial rounds of treatments, Bostwick left her full-time job in Texas to move back to Ohio to be closer to family, and she was unable to find a job that paid enough to cover IVF, student-loan payments, and her other expenses.\n\nShe now works as a part-time teacher at two different colleges, with an income in the low five figures.\n\n\"Could we go through IVF? Sure, but then we wouldn't be able to afford actually having a child,\" Bostwick said. \"It just felt like there's too much hanging over our heads.\"\n\nMany student-loan borrowers have told Business Insider that they've had to put off major life decisions, like having children, retiring, or purchasing a home, due to their high debt loads. The year ahead could bring even more financial strain to borrowers — President Donald Trump's Education Department will begin implementing a repayment overhaul in July, which includes new repayment plans with higher monthly payments.\n\nThe uncertainty of what's to come in the student-loan industry has borrowers like Bostwick wary of making major life decisions that could become significant financial burdens.\n\n\"It feels like any power was taken from me, all because of a decision I made when I was 18 years old that I didn't completely comprehend, that my parents didn't completely comprehend, that I felt was necessary in order to create this better life for myself,\" Bostwick said. \"And now it's really just become a noose around my neck.\"\n\nBostwick said she has 71 qualifying payments toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years, or 120 qualifying payments.\n\nHowever, she is also enrolled in the SAVE plan, created by former President Joe Biden and intended to provide borrowers with cheaper monthly payments and a shorter timeline to debt relief. Borrowers on the plan have been in forbearance since July 2024 due to litigation, meaning that PSLF borrowers have not been receiving credit toward forgiveness during that period.\n\nAdditionally, Trump's administration announced a proposed settlement to eliminate the plan. If a court approves the settlement, SAVE borrowers would have a limited time to enroll in a new income-driven repayment plan with higher payments.\n\n\"The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement alongside the announcement of the proposed settlement.\n\nIt's not that simple, Bostwick said. Many of the students she teaches are first-generation, like herself, and they pursued higher education because they were told it's the best way to achieve upward mobility and financial stability. Given her experience with student debt, Bostwick said she \"makes it her mission\" to ensure her students are aware of the implications of taking out loans, and that a degree isn't always necessary to pursue certain career paths.\n\n\"I've never once heard somebody say they don't want to be able to take out loans and never pay them back,\" Bostwick said. \"They want to be able to pay their loans back, but the current system makes it nearly impossible.\"\n\nTrump's Department of Education said it's working to improve the system. It just concluded negotiations on proposals aimed at preventing borrowers from taking out unaffordable debt, and it has previously said that its changes to repayment are aimed at reducing complexity in the student-loan industry.\n\nBostwick said she isn't getting her hopes up.\n\n\"I just feel like I've constantly been trying to keep my head above the water, and it's never really been good enough,\" she said. \"It's unbelievably frustrating.\"\n\nHave a story to share?

    "fullText": "The Miami Hurricanes head into the College Football Playoff national championship game with some pretty good news on the injury front. Elija Lofton has been ruled out, and Damari Brown appears to be trending towards a game time decision, but every other contributor avoided being on the availability report and appears good to go, including Ahmad Moten, Sr., Akheem Mesidor, and OJ Frederique.\n\nHowever, thanks to college football’s own controversial rule, the Hurricanes’ defense will still have to try to hold the Indiana Hoosiers in check without one of their most important players – starting cornerback Xavier Lucas.\n\nLucas was flagged for targeting in the second half of Miami’s 31-27 win over Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl. He hit Ole Miss WR Cayden Lee with his shoulder, but the contact occurred to Lee’s head, and Lucas was sent to the showers.\n\nIt’s not being talked about enough how ridiculous it is that Xavier Lucas has to sit out the first half of the title game because he tried to tackle the lower body of a receiver being led into him by his QB as the WR twisted his body down into his helmet.pic.twitter.com/oT3F5l3lnr\n\n— David Furones (@DavidFurones_) January 16, 2026\n\nBased on the NCAA’s rule, Lucas is suspended for the first half of Monday night’s clash with the Indiana Hoosiers. It feels like a heavy and unfair penalty because it is, particularly given it wasn’t an intentional and egregious hit. At some point as a defender, you have to commit to going into a hit, and a wide receiver’s body position changes in a millisecond, and some guys just miss. This was an example of exactly that. Now, as a result of playing football, Lucas will be watching with his helmet in his hand for the first 30 minutes.\n\nMario Cristobal was asked about the hit on Sunday morning at his joint press conference with Indiana’s Curt Cignetti, and he feels as though the rule should be revisited.\n\n“Certainly do. We feel it was unjustly administered, and now it impacts the last game of the season. We do have the ability, again, as an officiating crew and the powers that be to revisit that to give every team due process and their best ability to compete in this game.“\n\nIndiana’s offense is a handful, with Omar Cooper, Jr. Elijah Sarratt, and Charlie Becker forming a terrific trio of pass catchers. Miami is being severely hamstrung by this rule. Hopefully for Miami’s sakes, they can continue to control the game on offense early on with long, sustained drives and keep Indiana’s offense on the sideline.\n\nBecause if they don’t, an already extremely tough offense will be even tougher for the Hurricanes to stop. And on the game’s biggest stage, that’s a real shame.",

    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Robina Aminian's family believes the college student was killed by a bullet fired by Iranian security forces straight into the back of her head.\n\nBut her death in the nationwide protests that challenged the Islamic Republic's theocracy was only the start of the family's agony. In the aftermath of the killing, Aminian's mother had to look through piles of bloodied corpses to find her daughter's body. Then the family raced to escape authorities who might demand payment to release the body and buried her hastily in an unmarked roadside pit.\n\nTheir odyssey reflects the trail of anguish left by Iran's deadly assault on protesters, which has led to desperate relatives searching overflowing morgues across the country. For families, the loss of loved ones is compounded by the difficulty they face in grieving and giving the dead a dignified sendoff.\n\nMore than a week after she was killed, Aminian's relatives say they still have not held a funeral for the young Kurdish woman who was studying fashion in Tehran, the capital.\n\n“She wanted a bright future for herself,” her uncle, Nezar Minoei, said from Oslo. “But unfortunately, the future has been stolen from her.”\n\nDetails about what happened to Aminian are scant. After her death, her mother called relatives outside the country, recounting what she learned from Aminian's friends, who were present when she was killed.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke to three relatives, who all described similar details from the mother's account. An Oslo-based human rights organization, Iran Human Rights, released a report about her killing, citing witness testimony. They verified there was a shooting on the night of Jan. 8 around the campus of the Shariati Technical and Vocational College for Girls.\n\nWith communications greatly limited in Iran, the AP has been unable to independently confirm the family’s account or the wounds to Aminian’s body or to verify its location. The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York has declined to comment.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which relies on a network of activists on the ground and has been accurate during previous unrest in Iran, said at least 3,090 people have been killed. Iran's government has not offered any overall casualties figures.\n\nEverything that Aminian's relatives abroad know about her death comes from a brief phone call her mother was able to make Jan. 10 to relatives in Oslo.\n\nThey say the mother, Amina Norei, got a call Jan. 8 from Aminian’s friends, who said she had been gunned down by security forces. The friends told Norei they were walking away from campus in Tehran after dark when they saw a protest and joined in.\n\nA bullet fired by security forces struck the back of Aminian’s head, her friends told the mother.\n\nVideos shared on social media, verified by the AP, and statements by rights groups, doctors and survivors, describe Iranian agents using rifles and shotguns to disperse protesters across the country.\n\nIran's theocracy, which has used violence in previous rounds of unrest, increasingly refers to demonstrators as “terrorists.\" Authorities allege some demonstrators were armed, but there are no allegations that anyone was armed in Aminian's vicinity at the time of her death.\n\nAminian’s relatives said she was not an activist or involved in politics.\n\nAminian's mother was in Kermanshah, a western city in the Kurdish region of Iran nearly 460 kilometers (230 miles) from Tehran, when she learned about her daughter's death.\n\nShe rushed to Tehran in the middle of the night, she told family. Norei recalled to them how she began unzipping body bag after body bag, looking for Aminian.\n\n“She looked through so many beautiful faces, trying to find her girl,\" Hali Norei, Amnian's aunt, said from Oslo. ”And what is so horrifying for me is imagining what my sister feels as she searches for her daughter.\"\n\nMany other Iranian families are searching overflowing morgues for loved ones, according to rights group Amnesty International. Bodies have piled up in trucks, freight containers and warehouses, the group said.\n\nWhen Norei found her daughter, she was joined by her husband, daughter and son, and the family rushed out with the body, fearing authorities would block their way and insist on a payment to release the corpse, according to Minoei, Aminian’s uncle.\n\n“She actually stole the body,” Minoei said.\n\nIn a statement to the AP, the New York City-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said it has received multiple accounts of intelligence forces demanding money from families in exchange for the return of protesters' bodies. The group called the levies “a well-known, standard practice” in Iran to scare families into not publicly mourning their dead.\n\nOther families reported to the center that they were forced to sign papers falsely declaring that their dead relatives were members of the security forces in order to retrieve the bodies.\n\nIranian state television recently aired a statement saying mortuary and burial services were free, after repeated allegations of the practice.\n\nMinoei said the mother told him that she and her oldest daughter spent the seven-hour ride back to Kermanshah clutching the body in the backseat, blood and tears staining their clothes. When they got home, the mother told him, security forces had surrounded their house.\n\nAmina Norei told her family they had only one option: They drove out of town and dug a pit on the side of the road. They placed the body inside and drove away. Aminian is still believed to be buried there, in an unmarked grave.\n\nRelatives said they have not heard from Amina Norei or other relatives in Iran since Sunday.\n\nJulia Frankel reported from Jerusalem.",

According to Jason Scheer of 247Sports Smith is likely to end up at Cal, closer to home.\n\nThe 6-foot, 185-pound Smith committed to the UA last June, picking the Wildcats after previously choosing San Diego State. He signed in December after a stellar senior season at Central East High School where ran for 1,790 yards and 27 touchdowns and added five receiving scores.\n\nSmith is the second member of Arizona’s 2025 signing class to pull out after the fact. Last month 3-star Texas safety Griffin Tillis did the same.\n\nArizona’s roster is down to six running backs for 2026, led by returning contributors Quincy Craig and Kedrick Reescano and underclassmen Cornelius Warren and Wesley Yarbrough.

    "fullText": "As we hit the heart of the college basketball season, I’ll be bringing you a moneyline parlay every Saturday for what’s always a stacked slate of NCAA hoops action.\n\nToday, I’m backing undefeated Nebraska, an SMU squad that remains perfect at home, and Arkansas on the road.\n\nBest of all, this parlay has been BOOSTED by our friends at bet365! Here are my college basketball picks for January 17!\n\nTime: 4:00 p.m. ET\nLocation: Evanston, IL\nTV: Big Ten Network\nPick: Nebraska (-245)\n\nThe 17-0 Nebraska Cornhuskers are one of just three unbeaten teams left in college hoops. The Huskers have beaten quality competition, owning five wins over Top-40 KenPom teams — including victories against No. 12 Michigan State and No. 5 Illinois.\n\nThey won’t go undefeated forever, but a Northwestern Wildcats team that has lost eight straight games against high-major opponents isn’t likely to be the one to trip them up.\n\nTime: 12:00 p.m. ET\nLocation: Dallas, TX\nTV: ESPN2\nPick: SMU (+120)\n\nThis sets up as a potential letdown and lookahead spot for the Virginia Cavaliers, who are coming off a big road win at Louisville and have a week off after this game. The Hoos rely heavily on the 3-point shot, which doesn’t always travel well.\n\nMeanwhile, the SMU Mustangs are a perfect 11-0 at home, most recently beating Virginia Tech on a last-second half-court shot Wednesday. SMU boasts elite guard play and held its own on the road at Duke last week despite missing star guard Boopie Miller (20.8 ppg, 7.1 apg).\n\nBack at home with Miller in the lineup, the Mustangs should be in a strong position to get the job done against UVA.\n\nTime: 4:00 p.m. ET\nLocation: Athens, GA\nTV: ESPN2\nPick: Arkansas (+105)\n\nThe No. 21-ranked Georgia Bulldogs have been an offensive juggernaut, leading the nation at 96.4 points per game. That said, I’m not sold on Georgia’s resume, as the Bulldogs rank 116th in strength of schedule and are 0-2 in Quad 1 games.\n\nMeanwhile, the No. 17 Arkansas Razorbacks have faced the 27th-toughest schedule and are 3-4 in Quad 1 contests. Arkansas also boasts the more talented roster and the coaching edge with John Calipari on the sideline.\n\nThat’s enough for me to back the Razorbacks as short road dogs.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

That all starts on Saturday, as Jake Diebler’s Buckeyes welcome Mick Cronin’s UCLA Bruins (12-5, 4-2) to Columbus.\n\nBoth Ohio State and UCLA have feasted on the bottom of the Big Ten so far this year, with neither team beating a fellow Big Ten team that’s in the top half of the conference standings. For Ohio State, Saturday’s game is a Quad-2 opportunity, for UCLA, it’s a Quad-1 game.\n\nOhio State will be without senior forward Brandon Noel, while senior center Christoph Tilly will likely be listed as questionable after being treated for a head injury suffered last weekend at Washington. Ohio State’s newest player, former Penn State forward Puff Johnson, may be on the bench Saturday, but is not expected to suit up one day after being ruled eligible by a court in Franklin County.\n\nFollowing Saturday’s game, Ohio state will face Minnesota at home, Michigan on the road, and Penn State at home.\n\nUCLA will likely be without guard Skyy Clark, who averages 13.5 points per game and is sooting 48.6% from three this season, as he recovers from a hamstring injury.\n\nConnect with Connor: \nTwitter: @lemons_connor",

    "fullText": "Josh Pate declares whether Big Ten has overtaken SEC in college football moving forward originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf it were up to college football podcaster and analyst Josh Pate, the Big Ten-SEC debate as to which conference holds the cards isn't even close.\n\nPate said on a recent edition of \"Josh Pate's College Football Show\" that the Big Ten deserves the same respect, if not more, than the SEC in this current era of college football.\n\n“The SEC is lagging behind the Big Ten, at the top,\" Pate said. \"I would even venture to suggest the middle-tier now is at least comparable if not slightly lagging behind. That’s probably where my perception has changed of late, moreso than at the top. So I’m not beating that drum.”\n\nPate made an interesting follow-up point: it doesn't even matter that the Indiana Hoosiers are currently the class of the league. It's the psychological framework about what makes those players more polished than those from the SEC. And it's greater than just mental and physical toughness, Pate said.\n\nMore: Todd McShay passionately defends Dante Moore's decision to return to Oregon Ducks\n\n“Maybe the average Big Ten player is wired a little bit differently, maybe they focus a little more on the football aspect, the mean-and-potatoes aspect of football, instead of the more highlight-ish, branding aspect of football,” Pate said.\n\nThat \"wired\" approach is the most unique part. It can't be taught. It can't be studied.\n\n“If you think that’s ridiculous, it’s because it is,” Pate said. “But that’s been standard practice in the SEC for awhile. And I don’t find it to be the case in the Big Ten.”\n\nMore: Inside the special moment Indiana's Curt Cignetti will never forget\n\nWhether the narrative returns in favor of the SEC is unclear, but right now, the Big Ten can keep chasing excellence.\n\nEntering Monday night's game, a potential Hoosiers victory over the Miami Hurricanes may further validate Pate's argument while the SEC watches from the sidelines.\n\nWhat Dylan Raiola's commitment to Oregon Ducks signals for Dante Moore's NFL future\n\nCollege football analyst bashes SEC in defense of Big Ten as Indiana clinches title berth\n\nTodd McShay shares massive advice for Oregon QB Dante Moore on heels of NFL Draft decision\n\nIndiana QB Fernando Mendoza gets massive kudos from ex-NFL coach with interesting pro comp",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

    "fullText": "College stars in America have been having a gala time since Name, Image, and Likeness rights came into effect. It allows them to capitalize on their popularity financially, something superstars of the past, including Michael Jordan and LeBron James, were not able to do at the collegiate level. But, as with most things, the change has also had a negative impact on the sport, according to Paul Pierce for one.\n\nThe NBA legend feels that basketball in college has become far less competitive. The drive to get to the top, not just because they’re succeeding professionally, but also monetarily, seems to have gone.\n\nPierce feels budding talents in the NBA have become complacent, because from what they earn in college, they can easily take care of their families. The question is, could this affect the quality of the NBA in the future?\n\nThe ex-Boston Celticsman acknowledged that the NBA is not in trouble just yet. “This year, it’s a great class,” he said on Derrick White‘s podcast. “I think there’s some ballers out there in college. They look good…”\n\n*“But then, you look at some [and] it’s like damn, they don’t even care once they got that money now. You see certain players in high school that get to college now and you go like, what happened?”*\n\nWhite, adding on to what Pierce said, opined that the issue stems from kids growing up poor and suddenly having too much money in their hands in college. Before, it was about getting to the NBA to get that big paycheck. Now, if they do well in college, it’s not a necessity anymore.\n\nAnother problem that White pointed out was players jumping ship when they don’t like their stay in a particular college. “I don’t think the teams are as connected, like, in that culture. Now, I think it’s just random because, like transfer portal and all this is just going on.”\n\n“I think, money has something to do with it, but just, I think the culture is a little bit different now,” White concluded.\n\nPlayers who dream of making money would undoubtedly not care where they get it from. If college ball keeps them and their families relatively comfortable for the time being, its normal for most to take their foot off the pedal for a bit.\n\nPierce brought up a great point, describing how players like Stephen Curry, who did not grow up poor, still had that relentless drive to become a legend. He didn’t have NIL. But he had his father Dell Curry, a former NBA star, to back him. On the other hand, there were those like Ben Simmons, who were projected to be great, but earned their millions, and called it a day.\n\nBottom line, it depends on the mindset. Yes, NIL does influence certain things. But someone with a Curry-esque, or James-esque mentality, would never put their feet up in college.\n\nThe post “They Don’t Even Care”: Paul Pierce Questions if Money Is Ruining College Basketball appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "title": "LSU Tigers Have Assembled One Of The Nation's Best Quarterback Rooms",
    "description": "Five days ago, Lane Kiffin and the LSU Tigers had zero quarterbacks. Now they have three intriguing players and one of the best rooms in college football.",
    "fullText": "Just last week, the LSU Tigers had no scholarship quarterbacks on the roster and fans started to freak out. Now, they have assembled one of the strongest rooms in the nation, with as clear a plan for the future as the transfer portal era allows.\n\nAfter picking up their third commit on Wednesday morning, Lane Kiffin is likely done configuring his group. Here is how the quarterback room will look for the 2026 season:\n\nAfter nearly two weeks of searching, meeting and striking out with a couple of options, the Tigers ended up landing what some considered to be the best quarterback in the transfer portal.\n\nLeavitt had some hopes of being a top selection in the upcoming NFL draft, but last year didn't really go as planned. The production was down and a lisfranc injury cut his season short.\n\nLSU has no worry about that dip on the field or that injury. The Tigers will hand Leavitt the most weapons he's had to work with before and Kiffin's teams have become one of the best at developing quarterbacks.\n\nLeavitt has completed 61.4% of his career passes for 4,652 yards and 36 touchdowns to 11 interceptions. He has also run the ball 196 times for 816 yards and 10 more scores. He will be a perfect fit for the Kiffin and Charlie Weis Jr. offense.\n\nLongstreet likely entered the portal with hopes of landing a starting job somewhere, but instead he will remain a backup for this season with the opportunity of learning under Leavitt and Kiffin for a year. Leaving Lincoln Riley isn't something that top quarterbacks are known to do, but this is not a bad spot, either.\n\nWith Leavitt likely heading to the draft next year, Longstreet will be in line to become the starter next season. He was a five-star quarterback in the 2025 class and will have four years of eligibility remaining.\n\nLongstreet is a freak athlete, combining great speed and a very strong arm. It'll be fun to see what kind of player he will be able to develop into.\n\nHe appeared in four games for the USC Trojans this season, completing 13 of his 15 pass attempts for 103 yards and a touchdown. He also ran the ball 11 times for 76 yards and two more scores.\n\nIt was assumed that he was the safety option in case Leavitt went elsewhere, but now LSU gets both. With Peyton Houston coming in as a top high school prospect next year, the Tigers could have their next three starters decided if the transfer portal doesn't break things up.\n\nClark was a three-star transfer and unranked prospect out of high school, but figures to be a top-end backup option. He is known for his cannon of an arm. Kiffin knows what he's doing with small-school, unsuspecting talent.\n\nThe former Elon Phoenix standout completed 56% of his passes last year for 2,321 yards and 18 touchdowns to eight interceptions. He added 189 carries for 614 yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO — Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman spoke with reporters Wednesday for the first time since the Irish were left out of the College Football Playoff.\n\nHe touched on multiple topics, including addressing some big additions through the transfer portal. Here are six things Freeman said:\n\nThe “Here Come the Irish” docuseries on Peacock recently showed the moment the Irish coaches and players found out that Alabama and Miami made the CFP over them.\n\nFreeman stared at the video screen with his mouth open. Players put their faces in their hands.\n\nFreeman said Wednesday that he thought the series properly captured the disappointment and confusion they felt. A month later, he said there’s still disappointment for the Irish, who had been ranked No. 9 or 10 up until the selection show. Miami, which will play Indiana in the national championship Monday, received the last spot in the 12-team CFP.\n\n“But you have to move forward, and that’s what we’ve done as a program,” Freeman said. “That’s what I’ve done as a leader. As I reminded the group in our team meeting on Sunday, it’s our responsibility to make sure we leave no doubt. We can’t blame it on somebody else. Although I may be confused about some of the criteria and the committee’s rankings and all those different things, it’s our job as we move forward to make sure we leave no doubt.”\n\nFreeman said he hasn’t second-guessed his team’s decision to skip a bowl game after being left out of the CFP. He said he was proud of how the captains made the decision and didn’t believe it was an emotional one.\n\nHe asked them again and again if they were sure about the decision.\n\n“Because I didn’t want them to regret it,” Freeman said. “And they were convicted in their decision, and I fully support them.”\n\nFreeman’s name has popped up a few times in this NFL hiring cycle. But he announced he was staying at Notre Dame on Dec. 29, when he posted on social media: “2026…run it back”\n\nFreeman noted that he always tells his players that the future is uncertain.\n\n“But everything I want and everything that I need personally can be achieved right here as a head coach of this program,” he said. “And so I hope this is something we have to address every year. I really do because it means we’re having a lot of success right here at Notre Dame.”\n\nFreeman said he has used discussions with NFL teams to gather information and learn how he can be a better coach. He said he didn’t know if an NFL job would interest him at some point in the future.\n\n“I don’t know enough about it,” he said.” Maybe sometime in the future, if it’s the right time and it’s what I think is right for me, then maybe I’ll pursue it. But I don’t love wasting time thinking about things that aren’t right in front of me, and so I don’t know what I will want in however much length of time from now. I know right now that I am as convicted and motivated to be the best head coach of the Notre Dame football program as I can be.”\n\nLast month, Notre Dame and USC put their 96-game rivalry series on pause because they couldn’t agree to the timing of the 2026 game. The Irish then scheduled BYU for a home-and-home series instead.\n\nFreeman said he believes the rivalry is “important for college football” and the athletic department leaders will work to get it back at some point. But he said the proposed timing wasn’t best for Notre Dame and its 2026 CFP pursuit.\n\n“I’m a competitive individual, right?” Freeman said. “And I want to go play anytime, anywhere, but at the same token, it’s important that I make decisions too that are best for the program. And to move a game that we were pretty sure was going to be Week 12 to Week 0 isn’t what’s best for our program. And they had to make decisions that were best for their program. I don’t blame them. They had to make decisions. We had to make decisions.”\n\nFreeman believes his family’s name was “dragged through the mud unnecessarily” over a recent interaction at a high school wrestling tournament.\n\nAn assistant high school wrestling coach, identified by the South Bend Tribune as Chris Fleeger, accused Freeman of battery at the event, saying Freeman pushed him with two hands. But the St. Joseph County prosecutor’s office said it determined through video evidence and interviews that no criminal battery occurred, and Freeman won’t be charged.\n\n“I was confident in this outcome because I know I did not intentionally touch anyone in a rude, angry or disrespectful way,” Freeman said. “I’m glad this matter has been thoroughly reviewed and resolved.”\n\nFreeman took issue of the initial reporting of the incident by the South Bend Tribune before all of the evidence was released.\n\nNotre Dame said in a statement Sunday that the wrestling coach verbally accosted Freeman’s son, Vinny, a senior who signed to wrestle at Cornell, and Freeman and his wife tried to remove their son from the situation.\n\n“I know I’m a public figure, and I understand the scrutiny that comes with that,” Freeman said. “That scrutiny should not extend to my children or any other child of a public figure.”\n\nThe Irish recently announced the additions of former Ohio State wide receivers Quincy Porter and Mylan Graham.\n\nPorter was the nation’s fifth-ranked wide receiver and the No. 1 player from New Jersey in the 2025 class. He had four catches for 59 yards in four games as an Ohio State freshman after missing some time with an injury.\n\nGraham, who was a five-star prospect and the nation’s fifth-ranked receiver in 2024, had six catches for 93 yards in 2025.\n\n“We knew a lot about them in the high school recruiting process, who they were, the type of players they are,” Freeman said. “And I’m glad we were able to get them.”\n\nNotre Dame also landed in the portal former Alabama edge rusher Keon Keeley, who was a five-star recruit ranked No. 2 in the 247Sports composite rankings in 2023. Keeley originally had committed to Notre Dame out of high school before flipping to Alabama.\n\nFreeman called it “a little delayed gratification.”\n\n“I’ve always believed Keon was a Notre Dame kid coming from his high school,” he said. “He’s such a unique individual. He’s a very talented football player. … When he came on his visit, I’m like, ‘Yep, it’s the same Keon we recruited a couple years ago.’ And he fits here, and I’m excited for his future.”\n\nFreeman said linebacker Drayk Bowen had surgery on the labrum in his hip, but he expects him to return in some capacity this spring.\n\nThe Irish expect linebacker Kyngstonn Viliamu-Asa to be back to full-go around the start of the 2026 season. He is recovering from an ACL injury.",

    "description": "Alabama's first Heisman Trophy winner and two of the most imposing defensive linemen in the sport's recent history got the nod among a group of 22 inductees.",
    "fullText": "Nick Saban was front and center of last year's College Football Hall of Fame class. He coached seven national championship teams, including six at Alabama.\n\nThe first of those title-winning Crimson Tide squads featured running back Mark Ingram, who will be enshrined among this year's group of 22 inductees.\n\nIngram headlines a 2026 class announced Wednesday, along with defensive linemen Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh. They starred at Pitt and Nebraska, respectively, before enjoying prolific NFL careers.\n\nHere's the complete list of 18 players and four coaches headed to the Hall in Atlanta.\n\nRB Jerry Azumah – University of New Hampshire (1995-98)\n\nRB Ki-Jana Carter – Penn State (1991-94)\n\nOT Bruce Collie – University of Texas at Arlington (1981-84)\n\nLB George Cumby – Oklahoma (1976-79)\n\nDT Aaron Donald – Pittsburgh (2010-13)\n\nWR/KR Marvin Harrison – Syracuse (1992-95)\n\nRB Garrison Hearst – Georgia (1990-92)\n\nDB Chris Hudson – Colorado (1991-94)\n\nRB Mark Ingram – Alabama (2008-10)\n\nC Olin Kreutz – Washington (1995-97)\n\nLB James Laurinaitis – Ohio State (2005-08)\n\nQB Jordan Lynch – Northern Illinois (2010-13)\n\nWR Herman Moore – Virginia (1988-90)\n\nCB Terence Newman – Kansas State (1999-2002)\n\nOG Bob Novogratz– United States Military Academy (1957-58)\n\nDT Ndamukong Suh – Nebraska (2006-09)\n\nWR Peter Warrick – Florida State (1996-99)\n\nJim Margraff – Johns Hopkins (1990-2018)\n\nChris Petersen – Boise State (2006-13); Washington (2014-19)\n\nKen Sparks – Carson-Newman University (1980-2016)\n\nIngram rushed for 1,658 yards and piled up 20 total touchdowns (17 rushing and three receiving) during the 2009 season. He became the first Alabama player to win the Heisman Trophy, and the Crimson Tide won the BCS national championship. He went on to play 12 seasons in the NFL.\n\nLong before Donald was a three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year, he was ACC Defensive Player of the Year and a whole lot more. In fact, he swept the sport's major defensive awards during his final college season in 2013, when he stacked 28.5 TFLs, 11 sacks and 4 forced fumbles.\n\nSuh went on to earn All-Pro honors five times as a defensive stalwart in the NFL during the 2010s. But first, his play made him a must-watch sensation at Nebraska. In 2008, he recorded two pick 6s, and he notched a receiving touchdown while lining up as a fullback. The next season, he amassed 85 total tackles, 20.5 TFLs and 12 sacks before collecting hardware as college football's top defensive player.\n\nWarrick overlapped with FSU's dominance in the '90s. During the two-time first-team All-American receiver's four seasons with the Seminoles, they were a mainstay at the top of the national polls. He mounted 1,232 receiving yards and 13 total touchdowns in 1998 and then helped FSU win it all in 1999.\n\nHarrison is a Pro Football of Famer, too. He became a household name with the Indianapolis Colts. Before that, however, he developed at Syracuse, where he eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards and tallied two punt return touchdowns in 1995.\n\nPatterson was a TCU staple. He coached the Horned Frogs for 22 seasons, compiling a 181-79 record along the way. He guided them to 11 bowl victories — including a win in the Rose Bowl during the 2010 season another in the Peach Bowl during the 2014 season — and helped them navigate their transitions from Conference USA to the Mountain West and then to the Big 12.\n\nSimilarly, Petersen helped transform Boise State into the football power that it is today. He's the winningest-coach in the Broncos' history. From 2006-13, he went 92-12. In that span, he piloted Boise State to a pair of Fiesta Bowl victories: Those came in 2006 and 2009, each capping undefeated seasons and top-five finishes in the AP Poll. He later led Washington to three straight double-digit-win seasons from 2016-18, picking up a pair of Pac-12 titles in the process.",

    "fullText": "The 2025 college football season concludes on Monday night in Miami Gardens, Florida with the College Football Playoff National Championship Game. After an incredible regular season, an exciting bowl season, and a remarkable playoff, everything comes down to one final game to crown a champion.\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes and the Indiana Hoosiers will kick off at 6:30 p.m. CT at Hard Rock Stadium on January 19th, and a champion will be decided in Year 12 of the CFP and Year 2 of the expanded 12-team playoff.\n\nAfter two very different CFP semifinal games gave us our final two contenders for the national title, it’s time to put a bow on another stellar year of college football and determine who takes home the national championship for 2025.\n\nWhile our focus will be on who the Oklahoma Sooners are still gaining in the transfer portal once it closes on Friday night, we’ll be able to settle in and watch the season’s final game, before a long offseason awaits in college football.\n\nBelow is a full preview for the national championship game. We’ve also included a recap of the 2025 season in week-by-week form, a list of the college football champions at the lower levels, and a list of the FBS college football all-star games that are scheduled in the lead-up to the 2026 NFL Draft in April.\n\nSo, without further ado, the 156th season of college football comes to an end on Monday night. Here’s your preview for the national championship game.\n\nMiami has defeated Texas A&M, Ohio State and Ole Miss in succession to get to this point, after just sneaking into the CFP on selection day. Head coach Mario Cristobal and the Hurricanes have won in different ways during their playoff run, using a suffocating defense in the first two rounds, before getting a big performance from their offense in the semifinal. The ‘Canes have lost twice this season, but they’ve been rolling ever since, and they believe they have the overall talent to pull off a big upset on their home field.\n\nQuarterback Carson Beck had a huge day in the semis, and he’ll have to keep the mistakes down against an opponent that takes advantage of every miscue you make. This is a team that got here based on physicality up front and winning at the line of scrimmage, but a gigantic final test awaits them on Monday night. The U is oh-so close to being “back”, but to win the school’s first national title since 2001, they’ll have to do something no one else has been able to do this year.\n\nIndiana is the only undefeated FBS team, and they earned a bye in the first round of the playoff. Following that off week, they’ve promptly destroyed both Alabama and Oregon on their way to the title round. Head coach Curt Cignetti has turned the Hoosiers into an absolute juggernaut, and this is a veteran team that doesn’t make mistakes and executes at an extremely high level. Their offense is potent, their defense is everywhere, and they’ve taken down teams with far more overall blue-chippers on the roster with regularity.\n\nQuarterback Fernando Mendoza is the Heisman Trophy winner, and he is unbelievably efficient in this offense. With an excellent o-line, and skill players everywhere, it’s hard to keep up with what the Hoosiers are capable of. Defensively, Indiana forces mistakes constantly, and they make good offenses look bad every week. They set their offense up with short fields and squeeze the life out of their opponents. The Hoosiers are heavily favored on Monday, but if the 2025 season has taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected, and that anything is capable of happening.\n\nNCAA Division I FCS: Montana State Bobcats 35, Illinois State Redbirds 34 (OT)\n\nNCAA Division II: Ferris State Bulldogs 42, Harding Bisons 21\n\nNCAA Division III: Wisconsin River-Falls Falcons 24, North Central Cardinals 14\n\nNAIA: Grand View Vikings 22, Kaiser Seahawks 16\n\nNJCAA Division I: Iowa Western Reivers 28, Hutchinson Blue Dragons 10\n\nNJCAA Division III: DuPage Chaparrals 36, North Dakota State College of Science Wildcats 13\n\nCanadian U Sports college football: Montreal Carabins 30, Saskatchewan Huskies 16\n\nHula Bowl: Team Kai 38, Team Aina 21, in DeLand, Florida on January 10th at 11:00 a.m. CT\n\nTropical Bowl: American Team vs. National Team in Orlando, Florida on January 18th at 10:00 a.m. CT\n\nAmerican Bowl: Warhawks vs. Guardians in Lakeland, Florida on January 22nd at 7:00 p.m. CT\n\nEast-West Shrine Bowl: East Team vs. West Team in Frisco, Texas on January 27th at 6:00 p.m. CT\n\nSenior Bowl: American Team vs. National Team in Mobile, Alabama on January 31st at 1:30 p.m. CT\n\nHBCU Legacy Bowl: Team Robinson vs. Team Gaither in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 21st at 3:00 p.m. CT\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions. You can also follow Aaron on X@Aaron_Gelvin.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sooners Wire: Who will win the college football championship for the 2025 season?",

    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff reaches a thrilling conclusion on Monday night, and there are a few avenues to explore if you're looking to attend in person. Below, we've outlined everything you need to know about how to get College Football National Championship tickets in 2026, including a comparison of resale ticket prices.\n\nThe 2025 college football season concludes with a January 19, 2026, match-up between the No. 10 Miami Hurricanes and the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers. The two teams will face off at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, home of the Miami Dolphins. Miami beat Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl, and Indiana defeated Oregon in the Peach Bowl, sending the playoff underdog and top seed to the National Championship, where they're both vying for a shot at their first national title in the CFP era.\n\nGetting your hands on tickets to the championship can be tricky, and most tickets are only available through resale sites at the moment. We've compared prices across some of the top resellers, including StubHub and Vivid Seats.\n\nMost College Football Playoff National Championship tickets are sent to the respective schools involved and sold through each institution. On the Miami Hurricanes website, the Miami ticket allotment has sold out. We're also not seeing any tickets available through the Indiana Hoosiers website. This means that the resale ticket market is the next best place to snag a seat if you're still hoping to attend.\n\nThe official fan-to-fan exchange marketplace for the National Championship is through Ticketmaster, but we're also seeing listings on StubHub and Vivid Seats.\n\nThe cheapest resale listings we're seeing right now come from Vivid Seats, where ticket prices start at $2,899. On StubHub, the cheapest resale ticket listings start at $2,965. On Ticketmaster, the cheapest resale tickets start at $3,094. Prices are accurate at the time of writing, but they often fluctuate throughout the day as tickets are purchased and additional listings are added to the sites. The cheapest tickets are for Upper Level seats, while resale listings close to the field are reaching upwards of $15,000 across all sites.\n\nNote: Certain services and regions prohibit the resale of tickets. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal reselling of tickets, and entry into an event is at the venue's discretion.",

    "fullText": "The No. 1 Arizona Wildcats look to remain undefeated as they host the rival Arizona State Sun Devils in Big 12 play tonight.\n\nMy Arizona State vs. Arizona predictions and college basketball picks are bullish on the Wildcats’ offensive outlook for Wednesday, January 14.\n\nArizona State vs Arizona best bet: Arizona team total Over 94.5 (-125)\n\nThe Arizona Wildcats hold huge advantages over the Arizona State Sun Devils in just about every facet of this handicap, and they’re naturally expected to roll at home as 22-point favorites.\n\nRather than jump on that wide spread in a rivalry game, there are other betting opportunities for the No. 1 team in the country.\n\nArizona averages 91.1 points per game and ranks fourth in adjusted offensive efficiency (KenPom). There will be points in bunches available against a porous Arizona State defense surrendering 78.8 ppg and ranking 116th in adjusted defensive efficiency.\n\nBoth teams look to push the pace: the Wildcats rank 26th in adjusted tempo, and the Sun Devils are not far behind at 70th. There will be an abundance of possessions in this high-flying game, and the Wildcats will be able to score efficiently.\n\nArizona guard Jaden Bradley has posted at least five assists in four of his last five games, averaging 5.8 in that span. In an up-tempo game with a high team total, Arizona should do plenty of scoring, and that typically starts with Bradley as the lead guard.\n\nMassambia Diop is a true freshman sensation for the Sun Devils. He’s 7-foot-1 and has tremendous side-to-side agility, so he’ll be on the court for as many minutes as he can handle against a tough opponent with a strong frontcourt.\n\nHe’s picked up his scoring output as he gets more comfortable with the college game, scoring 16+ in each of his last four contests while averaging 19.8 in that span.\n\nMassambia Diop Over 15.5 points\n\nThis wide spread implies Arizona will win in a dominant blowout. While the Wildcats are certainly good enough to make that happen, that’s a narrow outcome to bank on from a betting perspective.\n\nThis is still a rivalry game, after all, and Arizona State has covered the spread in 10 of its last 14 road games.\n\nMassambia Diop Over 15.5 points\n\nSpread: Arizona State +22 | Arizona -22\n\nMoneyline: Arizona State +1600 | Arizona -5000\n\nOver/Under: Over 168 | Under 168\n\nArizona has scored at least 95 points in seven consecutive home games.

    "title": "I'm 7 months postgrad and still job hunting. I'm leaning on my hobbies to help overcome imposter syndrome.",
    "description": "I graduated from college and moved to New York City to apply for full-time jobs. I haven't found one yet, but I've learned to prioritize my hobbies.",
    "fullText": "Before graduating from Syracuse University last spring with a degree in journalism, it seemed like everyone (including me) was scrambling to make plans, get jobs, and figure out where to move.\n\nI always expected life after college would fall seamlessly into place, that all of my involvement in campus media, internships, and good grades would pay off immediately.\n\nSo, when I learned that my childhood friend was planning to move to New York City, it was the perfect opportunity to take the leap together. I'd always dreamed of moving there, and as the home of many big-name publications, it seemed like the right city to be in to kick-start my career.\n\nCome June, I'd moved, gotten a job at a coffee shop, and continued applying to every dream job under the sun (just like the hundreds of other LinkedIn applicants).\n\nLittle did I know, the barista position I'd only planned to have for a month or two would still be my lifeline seven months later.\n\nAt the beginning of my job search, I was incredibly motivated, but slowly, the rejections began to roll in.\n\nI started feeling like maybe I was the problem, that my experiences and skills weren't good enough. How was I supposed to gain more experience if no one would hire me?\n\nImposter syndrome hit me hard, especially since it seemed like the first question anyone wanted to ask me was, \"What do you do?\"\n\nAt first, I'd provide a whole spiel: I just graduated and am working as a barista while I look for a job in journalism, and interviews are going well. I always felt the need to make it appear as though I was on the brink of getting \"the job.\"\n\nThe catalyst for shifting my mindset came later, over dinner with a friend at our favorite Indian restaurant. We talked about life, relationships, New York work culture, and overall, what it means to unplug from the outside world for a second.\n\nMy friend shared his thoughts on being part of corporate America and said he doesn't base his worth on the job he has or his level of success. His words made me think about my own self-worth and why I'd been placing it all on my career and how qualified I am compared to others.\n\nNow, when I'm faced with the \"what do you do\" question, I say I'm a barista and freelancer looking for full-time work in journalism.\n\nI'm less concerned with explaining why I'm not working in corporate yet and more concerned with maintaining my peace and joy, as well as exploring my other interests.\n\nAlthough people's responses to my answers haven't changed much, my confidence in where I'm at and where I'm going has.\n\nAlthough this isn't the life I envisioned having after graduation, I'm grateful for the time I've had to explore my hobbies and be an active member of my community.\n\nAs an avid yogi and certified yoga teacher, I've enjoyed taking free yoga classes in Bryant Park. It's been a great way to get moving, plus it's given me a reason to stop with the endless job applications and catch up with some friends.\n\nIn my free time after barista shifts, I even parlayed my love of yoga into a three-month stint as a front desk receptionist at a studio in SoHo. In exchange for three hours of dedication a week, I got to take unlimited classes from some of the best yoga teachers I've ever had.\n\nAside from yoga, I also signed up with my roommate to volunteer within my Muslim community and teach religious education classes to kids.\n\nGrowing up, I loved attending these classes; it connected me to my culture and was also how my roommate and I met as kids. So, participating in this has felt like a full-circle moment that I likely wouldn't have had if I were already working full-time.\n\nHowever, despite finding a great community, I've found my feelings of imposter syndrome are still present — fueled by the overwhelming chaos and fast-paced energy of the city.\n\nOver the last few months, I've learned NYC isn't the best place for me — at least not right now.\n\nI always come home feeling like I haven't done enough, and it exhausts me. This is partially a result of my mindset, but I also think it's a direct consequence of living in a place known for its hustle.\n\nAlthough living here has been a great experience and played a huge role in helping me gain confidence, I'm ready for somewhere that's slower-paced.\n\nThere are, of course, still days when I struggle with my own self-talk and understanding my purpose, but I'm confident a move is the best next step for me as I continue working toward my goals and exploring all of the other things that make me who I am.\n\nMy time in the industry will come, and until then, I'll keep side-questing and doing everything I can to remain happy and present.",

    "fullText": "If the season ended today, the Spartans would land as one of the higher seeds in the NCAA Tournament, according to one college hockey analyst.\n\nA popular college hockey social media account released an updated batch of bracketology projections earlier this week, which has the Spartans cemented in the tournament field. College Puck NXT has Michigan State as a No. 2 seed in the Loveland, Colo.-based region. The Spartans would be slated to face No. 3 seed Denver in the first round of the tournament, according to this bracket projection.\n\nMichigan State ranks as the No. 4 team nationally in this week's USCHO.com poll, and holds an impressive 15-5-0 record on the year. The Spartans, though, haven't been as dominant during the regular season as we've seen in the last two seasons -- which they ended up with No. 1 seeds in each year.\n\nMichigan State is set to play a massive two-game road series at No. 2 Wisconsin this weekend. This will certainly be a set of games that could help raise the Spartans' tournament stock should they come out with a win or two.\n\nClick on the post below to see the complete NCAA Tournament bracket projection:\n\nFIRST College Puck NXT Bracketology of 2026\n\nKey Notes🎶\n🧮Seedings & Order based on CURRENT NPI\n🧐 IF the season ended today Hockey East would have ONE NCAA Tourney representative after sending SIX teams to the tourney last season\n🤯ECAC & CCHA would send 6 of 16 teams… pic.twitter.com/W2DzoYv2sx\n\n— College Puck NXT (@CollegePuckNXT) January 12, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page onFacebookto follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

He originally planned to attend with music artist Drake and watch Texas A&M take on Miami, but the illness prevented that.\n\nManziel played for the Aggies in 2012 and 2013, becoming the first-ever freshman Heisman winner and just the second player to win the award in program history. Here is the full clip of Manziel discussing the incident that led to his missed appearance.\n\nFormer Texas A&M QB Johnny Manziel explained on his podcast what went into him missing his scheduled “College GameDay” appearance for A&M vs. Miami. He said he planned to go to the game with Drake but got sick the night before with an “unbelievable” virus. https://t.co/jYbSoxsig8 pic.twitter.com/Z7guLzSghd\n\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) January 8, 2026\n\nWhile rumors ran rampant across social media when former Aggie basketball player Alex Caruso was named the guest picker in place of Manziel, he seemed to shut those down on the most recent episode of his podcast. Manziel was in attendance for multiple contests at Kyle Field in 2025, while also spending time with current Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed, who displayed much improvement this season at the helm and will return to play for the Maroon and White for his junior season.\n\nThe year didn't conclude as the Aggies had wished, but head coach Mike Elko has led the program to historic heights in just his second season coaching in Bryan-College Station, Texas. Elko's squad secured the school's first 11-0 start since 1992 and its first playoff appearance in 2025.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Dylan on X: @dylanmflippo.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Former Texas A&M QB Johnny Manziel explains \"College Gameday\" absence",

    "description": "With the 2025 portion of the college women's basketball season over, here's who is shaping up to be one of the teams in the 2026 Final Four.",
    "fullText": "It’s a big year for college women’s basketball in Phoenix, with the Final Four heading to Mortgage Matchup Center on April 3-5, and the potential four teams are taking shape.\n\nWhile there are less than three months before the bracket is set, several leading contenders have emerged. Some schools are blue bloods, while others have steadily become powerhouses.\n\nEach team is led by a cast of stars who will undoubtedly make it an exciting stretch ahead of the Final Four.\n\nThe No. 1 Huskies are a heavy favorite to go undefeated in the regular season, which also makes them a heavy favorite for the Final Four.\n\nThe program’s 15-0 start marks its best opening since the 2017-18 season, when it won its first 36 contests before falling, 91-89 in overtime, to Notre Dame in the national championship game.\n\nSophomore forward Sarah Strong, at the forefront of UConn’s success, has made a compelling case for National Player of the Year. Guard Azzi Fudd has also been playing a big role, furthering the Huskies’ bid for a repeat as champions.\n\nIt’s been another big season for No. 2 Texas as the Longhorns basically drifted through nonconference play.\n\nTexas (17-0) didn’t have an easy schedule, but made quick work of several Top 25 teams, including a 76-65 win over then-No. 3 UCLA. Only South Carolina and Ole Miss have challenged the Longhorns so far, with Texas winning by one possession in both games.\n\nFifth-year point guard Rori Harmon is one of the best in the country and has been the engine for the team. Leading scorer Madison Booker has been having another productive season with at least 20 points in five of her past seven games through Jan. 6.\n\nThe Longhorns have a great shot of getting back to the Final Four for the second consecutive year.\n\nUnder coach Dawn Staley, the Gamecocks are always in consideration for the Final Four.\n\nSince losing in last season’s national title game against UConn, South Carolina has dealt with a great deal of adversity in a short span. The Gamecocks received unfortunate news when forward Chloe Kitts tore her ACL in September, sidelining her for the season.\n\nMore recently, key transfer Ta’Niya Latson injured her ankle in late December and has been day-to-day. The starting guard has averaged 16.9 points this season, and was the scoring leader last season at North Carolina State with 25.2 points per game.\n\nHowever, the Gamecocks have found ways to continue their high-level play. Sophomore forward Joyce Edwards leads the team with 21.0 points. Center Madina Okot has been stellar with 11.5 rebounds per game. South Carolina will soon receive more help in the post with Alicia Tournebize, a 6-foot-7-inch player from France, joining the team midseason and gearing up to play.\n\nOne of the more experienced teams in the NCAA, the Bruins have a great shot of making their second straight Final Four appearance, especially with it potentially being center Lauren Betts’ final season.\n\nBetts, expected to go in the top five of the 2026 WNBA Draft, has surpassed 1,500 career points and has made important defensive plays in the biggest moments for the Bruins.\n\nWhile Betts has been key to UCLA’s success, she’s also been surrounded by depth in senior starters Kiki Rice, Gianna Kneepkens, Charlisse Leger-Walker and Gabriela Jaquez.\n\nUCLA’s starting lineup has combined to play 581 collegiate games, which can play a big factor in winning the Big Ten championship and eventually reaching the Final Four.\n\nThere are a lot of SEC teams that have impressed this season, and the Sooners have shown that they deserve to be considered with the likes of Texas and South Carolina.\n\nThe program has steadily improved under fourth-year head coach Jennie Baranczyk, who took Oklahoma to its first Sweet 16 since 2013 last season. Baranczyk has taken the Sooners to at least the second round of the NCAA Tournament in all four seasons.\n\nOklahoma (14-1) has only gotten better, adding highly touted recruit Aaliyah Chavez to its roster.

A win for Ohio State would also make them 4-0 in Big Ten road games for the first time since the 2017-18 team, which won its first five Big Ten road games.\n\nWith Brandon Noel out for the foreseeable future with an unspecified foot injury, Gabe Cupps stepped up for Ohio State against Oregon, scoring nine points on 3-of-4 shooting in 23 minutes. Devin Royal registered his third double-double of the season, scoring 14 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in 36 minutes.\n\nThe Huskies could be without two of their four leading scorers on Sunday night, but their availability won’t be known until closer to game time. Senior guard Desmond Claude is currently away from the team due to a personal matter, and was not at practice on Saturday. Sophomore guard Wesley Yates has missed Washington’s last four games with a wrist injury, and will be a game-time decision on Sunday night. Washington coach Danny Sprinkle has not ruled either player out, but said that if Yates plays, his minutes will be limited.\n\nConnect with Connor: \nTwitter: @lemons_connor",

I think it’s really important to re-emphasize. When you watch a team, and I always come in on Sunday and get ready to watch a team or get ready to play, some things stand out. I don’t watch, necessarily, the — hey, that’s a great touchdown pass.

You never see what happened, like the pick six, where a guy misses a block or something happens. So, perimeter blocking. How about the running back steps up and hits a linebacker or safety coming from a 10-yard running start and the running back hits him right in the jaw,” Meyer said. “And Mendoza completes a pass. The route efficiency. There’s no wasted movement when the receivers run their routes. Those aren’t all five-star receivers; those aren’t first-rounders. Those are guys that are really, really good players that play great.\"\n\nThey will have a chance to showcase themselves once more against a Hurricanes team on a mission to continue shocking college football as they upset Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl before ending Ole Miss' season in the Fiesta Bowl to get to the title game themselves. They knocked off Texas A&M in the opening round in College Station.\n\nThe game is set for Monday, Jan. 19, in Miami Gardens, Fla., providing a fitting conclusion to an otherwise chaotic season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Indiana Hoosiers are on the doorstep of college football history, carrying an unbeaten season into the national championship game with a chance to accomplish something no modern team ever has.\n\nAt 15-0, Indiana is already one of just five teams in the modern era to reach that mark. A win against the Miami Hurricanes would make the Hoosiers the first major college football program to finish 16-0 since Yale Bulldogs accomplished the feat in 1894 — an era of leather helmets and no forward pass.\n\nWhat makes Indiana’s run even more remarkable is how it was built. The Hoosiers entered the season without a single five-star recruit, leaning instead on development and precision under second-year coach Curt Cignetti. Once one of the most consistent rebuild jobs in the Big Ten, Indiana is now one win from the most dominant single season in program history.\n\nMore: Fernando Mendoza's family ties to Mario Cristobal run deep with Miami homecoming\n\nIndiana announced itself on the sport’s biggest stage with a 56-22 dismantling of the Oregon Ducks in the Peach Bowl.
