    "description": "Why having a developmental program isn't bad.",
    "fullText": "Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano has made many claims that the Scarlet Knights are a “developmental program”, and for good reason. Over the years, Schiano and his company have taken lower-graded talent, even walk-ons, and turned them into capable starters at the college level. A few recent notable examples of this are offensive tackle Hollin Pierce (walk-on), wide receiver Christian Dremel (walk-on), cornerback Christian Braswell (two-star), safety Christian Izien (three-star), and running back Kyle Monangai (a low three-star). Out of those five players, four have landed on NFL teams, largely due to their exceptional development in college.\n\nThat development has continued into 2025 and has paid dividends on offense last season. Players like KJ Duff, Antwan Raymond, Athan Kaliakmanis, and many of the offensive linemen looked better this season than last. In other words, their college development continued at a very solid pace through the offseason. However, that trend did not continue on the defensive side of the ball. In fact, many players regressed in some areas.\n\nFor example, many of the transfers Rutgers brought in were completely ineffective. There were questions on whether grabbing players from lower levels would help the Knights, since it is a large jump from the group of five to the Big Ten, but to be reduced to what they were just doesn’t make sense. Not only were players like Bradley Weaver, Jett Elad, Eric O’Neill, and Jacobie Henderson solid starters at the lower level, they were stars. Stars who should have been able to adjust to the Big Ten if given the proper guidance. If a few of the defensive portal additions didn’t adjust properly, that would be a different story. However, since none of them did, other than Elad and O’Neill to a very late and very limited degree, it becomes clear that they were not developed properly to compete at this level once they got here.\n\nThe examples continue with returning players as well. Linebacker Dariel Djabome was a star for Rutgers last season. Safety Kaj Sanders showed a lot of promise in his freshman season. Both of them took a step back this season under new position coaches. Players don’t just forget how to play football. Stars don’t just forget how to be stars. The development from last year to this year did not continue, and as a result, players regressed.\n\nMany of the Rutgers faithful are disgruntled with the term “developmental program.” However, how much of that hostility has stemmed from the reality that this so-called developmental program did not develop much last season on defense? If the transfers were developed to be Big Ten-ready, and if the talent from last season on defense continued its progression, the term developmental program would seem more fitting. Perhaps it is not the notion of being a developmental program that’s the issue, but rather the execution of those claims.\n\nRutgers under Greg Schiano will always have the mindset of being a developmental program, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, especially for a program like Rutgers that can’t just recruit several five stars year in and year out. On offense this season, they showed that they can do just that. However, it is the several poor and inexperienced defensive coaching hires that the Knights have made that have made them deviate from actually developing the players on that side of the ball. If Rutgers football can make the appropriate coaching hires on defense this offseason, it should be able to get back on track towards becoming a better overall team.",

    "title": "From Dan Lanning to Bob Chesney; ranking the top HC's in the CFP",
    "description": "With the College Football Playoffs fast approaching, we ranked the top head coaches in the field.",
    "fullText": "In football, the head coach's decisions have the ability to swing games, whether it's a head-scratching play-call or a botched end-of-game situation. Those decisions are magnified in a postseason setting, which is exactly the stakes of the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe best coaches are able to manage the game to their advantage, giving their players the best possible chance to go out and succeed. But others unintentionally find ways to undercut their players and team, resulting in a loss that could've been a win simply with better coaching.\n\nThe 2025 edition of the CFP features a number of high-level coaches.\n\nEven the head coaches of the Group of Five teams in the field, James Madison's Bob Chesney and Tulane's Jon Sumrall, will not be back at their respective programs after accepting Power 4 head coaching positions. Some have championship pedigree; others are just kicking open the door of their careers. One coach, due to the nature of college football in 2025, has never been a head coach but will be thrust into the spotlight come the first round.\n\nIn this piece, we'll be ranking each head coach participating in the CFP from 12 to 1, taking into account all the duties that it takes to be a head football coach in the playoff.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-1, 7-1 SEC\n\nAs a result of Lane Kiffin's pre-CFP departure to LSU, Pete Golding was named the head coach of the Rebels both in the playoff and moving forward. Though he's fielded solid units during his three seasons as the defensive coordinator, it wouldn't be responsible to rank him anywhere else but 12th on this list, as he's never been the head coach for a game at the college level.\n\n2025 Team Record: 10-2, 6-2 ACC\n\nMario Cristobal as a recruiter and Mario Cristobal as a football coach are two different things and thus would place him at different spot on this list. But as a football coach, the former Ducks head man has made numerous questionable on-field decisions during his time with Miami. Let's not forget, two ACC losses had the Hurricanes relying on a win all the way back in August against a Notre Dame quarterback in CJ Carr making his first career start just to eke their way into the final at-large spot.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-2, 8-1 AAC\n\nHaving accepted the head coaching job at Florida, this will be Jon Sumrall's final ride with the Green Wave. He's shown himself as someone who can turn programs around, as he took over a five-win Troy program in 2022 and immediately won 23 combined games in two seasons before taking the Tulane job. The Green Wave won 11 games before he got there and he's more than kept them afloat, elevating them to a playoff appearance. Despite making the CFP, Sumrall's team isn't particularly great at anything and is just 50th in scoring defense, his speciality. For those reasons, Sumrall, still a very good coach and worthy of the Gators' job, lands at No. 10.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 9-0 Sun Belt Conference\n\nTaking over the James Madison program ahead of 2024 season after leading Holy Cross to five consecutive Patriot League titles, the winning ways have continued for the Dukes under Bob Chesney. Curt Cignetti lifted up the program as they became an FBS team in 2022, and Chesney has done even better. The 48-year-old is still relatively on the younger side as a head coach and has proven himself to be a tremendous leader of men in his 16 years as a head coach — so much so that he was hired by UCLA to try to resurrect the Bruins' program.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-1, 7-1 SEC\n\nIt's hard to argue with Mike Elko's record this season, but due to the disappointments of last season's 8-5 campaign and Las Vegas Bowl meltdown loss to the USC Trojans, it's hard to put him any higher on this list. A 7-5 season in 2023 at Duke managed to get him hired to lead the Aggies program and he's done what's asked of him in leading them to the playoff. But you're unlikely to hear Elko's name uttered amongst the inner circle of college football head coaches anytime soon.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 9-1 Big 12\n\nJoey McGuire's in a similar spot as Elko, as he's unlikely to be mentioned with the top head coaches in the sport. Despite that, he's done a good job with this Red Raiders team, albeit with an influx in NIL compensation and transfer portal talent. Regardless, McGuire is ultimately responsible for the coalition of the team as a whole and they've meshed about as well as anyone could've hoped.\n\n2025 Team Record: 10-3, 7-2 SEC\n\nDeBoar catches a lot of heat whenever Alabama loses, but it's always worth a reminder that he's following the legend of Nick Saban — who is un-followable and the Crimson Tide job was always going to be a tough one once he retired because the expectations are set through the roof. All things considered, DeBoer has handled it relatively well. Where he excels is on the offensive side of the ball, as he led an explosive Washington offense in 2023 to the national title game and has the Tide averaging over 30 points per game in the rugged SEC.\n\n2025 Team Record: 10-2, 6-2 SEC\n\nBrent Venables' coaching tenure at Oklahoma has been mired with two disappointing 6-7 seasons, but his defensive coaching prowess has been on full display in 2025, completely carrying him to a top five spot. Despite battling SEC teams for eight of their games, the Sooners' defense ranks seventh in scoring defense and ninth in scoring defense. Without those efforts on that side of the ball, Venables and Oklahoma wouldn't be anywhere close to the position they're in.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 9-1 Big Ten\n\nThere's a clear top four of head coaches in the CFP and Ryan Day just barely misses out on the top three. Yes, he has an 82-11 record, won a national championship last season and just extinguished his four-game losing streak to the rival Michigan Wolverines. But much of the Buckeyes' successes have been due to the coordinator and position coaches, who have been extremely highly-regarded. Day doesn't project as a \"leader of men\" type of coach nor as an X's and O's guy. He's the conductor of the whole show for Ohio State and deserves credit for the national title, but falls behind the following three coaches.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 8-1 SEC\n\nOne of the best things about Kirby Smart during his time at Georgia has been that the Bulldogs have an identity. They know exactly who they are as a team, as they'll punch you in the mouth and drag you to the deep end. It's a mentality thing and one that Smart has instilled within the culture of his program. He's won two national championships and come close to more, with this season presenting itself as another opportunity. Off-the-field player issues aside, Smart is one of the golden standards of head football coaches in the sport.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-1, 8-1 Big Ten\n\nDan Lanning's defensive prowess showed perhaps this season more than any other during his four-year tenure with the Oregon Ducks, but it was his ability to motivate his players that stuck out the most. Any slight against his program gets used to his advantage, as his motivational tactics are top notch. The only thing missing for Lanning — though to be fair it is just his fourth season — is postseason success, as he hasn't led the Ducks to a playoff win. He'll have a good chance to do so in Oregon's first-round matchup with Chesney's James Madison squad.\n\n2025 Team Record: 13-0, 10-0 Big Ten\n\nI mean, just Google him. All Curt Cignetti does is win, and he's done it at every stop. He elevated James Madison into an 11-win team in his second season and has completely uplifted the entire Indiana program from the bottom of the conference and resigned to being a \"basketball school\" to what it is today: champions of the Big Ten and the No. 1 seed in the CFP. Meanwhile, he had a scowl on his face after the conference title game. Cignetti is never satisfied with success and has him team on the path of winning a national championship.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Ranking the top head coaches in the 2025 CFP field",

    "description": "I got pregnant with my daughter in college. Eighteen years later, I can't imagine my daughter being pregnant as she's about to start her new life.",
    "fullText": "I've been helping my 17-year-old daughter, a senior in high school, apply to college.\n\nI've watched her type her applications, and it sparked a flashback to when I sat in the kitchen of my run-down college apartment and learned I was pregnant with her.\n\nI'll never forget the look of the brown linoleum floor illuminated under the harsh fluorescent light, its buzzing the only other sound competing with my sobs. My boyfriend held his head in his hands, the positive pregnancy tests fanned around him like the color sticks at a nail salon.\n\nIs it really possible that I was only a few years older than my daughter is right now? She, who still prefers me to run in and grab the smoothie I preordered because she doesn't like to talk to people? The girl whose room is messier than I ever thought possible? The one whose kindergarten picture was so perfect it took my breath away?\n\nI can't even fathom what it would look like for her to be facing down motherhood in a few short years, so it's stirred some new emotions up for me.\n\nI distinctly remember my boyfriend picking me up for class at the beginning of that semester. The sun was shining, my gold hoops were swinging, and as I hopped into his truck, I felt a surge of hope and excitement for the future.\n\nThat was a few weeks before I would realize that my period was not coming after all. Looking at my daughter now, it's finally hitting me: I was so young.\n\nThe naive self-confidence of my younger, college self crumbled that night in my apartment kitchen, and I can't say that I ever regained it. Becoming a mother at any stage can have that effect on you. It carves you apart, empties you out, and makes you question everything at all times forever.\n\nNow, as my teenage daughter teeters on the cusp of the age I was when I had her, I feel a little bit of loss and grief for my own self at her stage.\n\nSeeing her with the world at her fingertips reminds me of how I felt just before she came into existence. I had no fears. I was confident in a way I would never be again.\n\nBut what I remember the most, among the uncertainty, the anxiety, and the complete reorganizing of myself, is the moment I met her, the instant the nurse laid her on my chest. The moment my newborn baby nestled herself into me, burrowing, it felt as though she had straight into my heart; I felt a complete recognition, like nothing I could ever describe. My only thought was, Oh. It's you.\n\nI remember a complete calm settling into my being, as if we were two souls who had known each other forever, simply meeting again.\n\nI feel like I've spent the past 18 years learning who I am with her and because of her. Overnight, I'm supposed to relearn what it's like to live without her here. I feel a mixture of fear and excitement for her future, much like I did in those early days of her existence.\n\nI also feel grief for the girl I was when I had her, but I don't want her to share in that grief.\n\nI want her to feel the freedom I had at her age, even if I acknowledge the loss of my own.\n\nI want her to have a life I did not have, while never, for a second, feeling guilt for her life.\n\nI want things that feel impossible, for both of us. But she has the world at her fingertips now, and I want so much for her to embrace every bit of it, maybe, selfishly, for both of us.\n\nAnd no matter what happens, I hope and pray that we can always find our way back together, just like that moment we first met, when I can hold her close again and whisper, Oh, it's you.",

    "fullText": "On Saturday, 22-year-old Fernando Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to their first Big Ten championship since 1967 — but the top quarterback's professional résumé looks nearly as impressive as his football record.\n\nWith their 13-10 win over Ohio State, Indiana secured the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history — and Mendoza's performance solidified his Heisman Trophy frontrunner status.\n\nBorn and raised in Miami, Mendoza was a two-star recruit out of high school and overlooked by most Power 4 programs. He was committed to playing at Yale until Cal lost a prospect and called him up with an offer he couldn't turn down: a free education and better football.\n\nAfter three seasons at Cal, where he worked his way up to starting quarterback and graduated from the prestigious Haas School of Business, he transferred to Indiana last winter. The move meant losing his scholarship with Cal, but earning a lot more money in endorsement deals.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, one of the first things he did with his \"name, image, likeness\" earnings was to cover the cost of the two classes he needed to graduate from Cal after his scholarship was terminated.\n\nMendoza, who's now pursuing his master's at Indiana's Kelley School of Business, spends more time on LinkedIn than he does on Instagram, TikTok, or other social platforms.\n\n\"The only social media that's on my phone right now is LinkedIn and YouTube to watch videos,\" he told The Herald Times. He has an Instagram account with more than 80,000 followers, but enlists his younger brother, Alberto, who also plays quarterback for the Hoosiers, to manage it.\n\nA post shared by HeraldTimesOnline (@heraldtimesonline)\n\nMendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also be a top candidate for a job in finance.\n\nHe's spent his last few summers interning at real estate investment firms ACRE and Newmark. Juggling his internships with hours of football practice required a 5:30 a.m. wake-up call and an intricate whiteboard, where he'd keep a running list of action items.\n\nMendoza is just as disciplined with his money as he is with his schedule.\n\n\"He doesn't spend any money on himself,\" his mom told the WSJ. \"All he does is invest.\"\n\nA post shared by Big Ten Network (@bigtennetwork)\n\nHis brother, with whom he shared a room growing up and now shares a car, pointed out that he also doesn't like to spend money on gas.\n\nAlberto told Big Ten Network: \"I go to use the car, and it's empty. There's no more gas in the car, and I'm like, 'We're just gonna use the car and not fill it back up?' And Fernando is like, 'Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.' … And then I have to go to the gas station on like one mile of gas.\"",
