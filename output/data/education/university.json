    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) – A former member of the Ohio State University football program is now suing the university, claiming he was discriminated against because he is a man.\n\nFormer defensive quality control coach Joseph Lyberger was fired last April after an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment was made against him.\n\nIn court filings, Lyberger’s attorney argues the university presumed he was guilty because of his gender and that there was a lack of evidence against him.\n\nSnow storm offers unique dog training opportunity in central Ohio\n\nA letter from the Ohio State Office of University Compliance and Integrity terminating Lyberger offers some details as to why he was fired. According to the letter, an investigation found Lyberger violated sexual harassment and stalking policies in his interactions with a coworker from August to December 2024.\n\nIn a statement, Lyberger’s attorneys said, in part, “Ohio State relied on sex-based stereotypes in evaluating credibility, presuming guilt based on Mr. Lyberger’s gender.” The statement further claims Lyberger was the victim of “reports of harassment, explicit threats to ‘ruin’ his career, and retaliatory conduct by his coworkers.”\n\nLyberger was a member of the Buckeyes’ coaching staff starting in 2021 after working as a defensive assistant for Bucknell and Ohio Dominican. Before moving to college coaching, he was an assistant football coach and assistant wrestling coach at Olentangy High School.\n\nThe university said it does not comment on pending litigation.",

    "fullText": "The House Committee on Education and Workforce has asked the University of Utah to schedule a briefing to discuss the school’s plans to take money from a New York-based private equity firm.\n\nThe committee, which has jurisdiction over federal education policy, is examining the growing trend of schools seeking institutional partners to capitalize their athletic departments. The group is assessing whether legislative action might be needed to address concerns about the downstream impact of these deals.\n\nColorado's Dempsey Goes From House Objector to China Scholar\n\nSports Tech Mergers Double in Value in 'Landmark Year'\n\nCollege Recruiting Costs Shrink as Football Powers Adapt to Portal\n\nIn a letter sent to Utah president Taylor Randall on Monday morning, a copy of which was viewed by Sportico, the committee requested that the school share information regarding the details and motives behind its potential partnership with Otro Capital, which its trustees greenlit in December.\n\n“While recognizing the escalating costs in collegiate athletics, including revenue share obligations under the House v. NCAA settlement, NIL-related expenses and coaching salaries, the committee seeks to better understand the university’s rationale for entering into this arrangement,” committee chair Tim Walberg (R—Mich.) and Burgess Owens (R—Utah), a former NFL and University of Miami player and chairman of the subcommittee on Higher Education Workforce Development, wrote in the letter. “The information and briefing requested will assist the committee in determining whether legislative action may be necessary to protect students, schools and the integrity of college athletics.”\n\nAs conversations between schools and institutional funds have grown more public, so too have concerns from lawmakers. Last month, on the verge of the College Football Playoff title game, Reps. Michael Baumgartner (R—Wash.) and Haley Stevens (D—Mich.) wrote a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker asking him to limit the emergence of PE deals that “threaten the integrity of university governance and the quality of college sports in ways that will have disastrous consequences for athletes, students and fans.”\n\nLocal state-level lawmakers in both Utah and Washington have proposed bills that would also make it harder to execute these deals.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce’s letter to Randall requests that the university share terms of the arrangement and answer three specific questions:\n\nWhat factors and considerations led the university to pursue this partnership, and why was this approach selected over other potential financing options?\n\nWhat steps is the university taking to maintain institutional control and to protect student-athlete welfare, including compliance with Title IX under this partnership structure?\n\nHow might this partnership affect student costs, particularly with respect to mandatory student fees that subsidize the athletic department, and are any changes to the fee structure anticipated following implementation?\n\nRepresentatives for Utah and its athletic department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe University of Utah trustees voted during their December meeting to allow Randall, athletic department Mark Harlan and others to finalize a deal with Otro. While it’s unclear if that final arrangement has been signed, the structure of the deal was openly discussed. Utah is spinning the Utes’ athletics revenue streams into a for-profit entity, and plans to sell an equity stake in that business.\n\nRandall played a prominent part in the formal 110-minute pitch to the trustees, helping explain the macro reasons why Utah is seeking the money, and why Otro Capital was the right partner.\n\nFinancial specifics, however, have been sparse. The school has declined to share details on a deal that likely tops nine figures. A Sportico open records request for any term sheet between the school and Otro, filed back in September, is yet to be fulfilled following multiple university extensions.\n\nUtah is not alone in seeking institutional money to adapt to the modern economics of college sports. The Big Ten, for example, was recently on the verge of a $2.4 billion partnership with a California pension fund, but those talks are now on hold after pushback from some conference members about the 20-year revenue share commitment that came with the deal.\n\nThe Big 12 is in advanced talks on a potential $500 million deal with Collegiate Athletic Solutions (CAS), a fund backed by RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital, that would let schools take upfront money in exchange for revenue sharing on the back end. That deal, unlike the proposals involving Utah and the Big Ten, does not involve any equity changing hands.\n\nSeparately, a number of other schools, such as Kentucky and Clemson, have created similar separate commercial entities, but they are yet to take outside institutional investment. Those deals are widely considered necessary step for public schools to take on institutional money for athletics.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce, which dates back to 1867, has 21 majority members, and 16 minority members. Under House Rule X, the committee is tasked with reviewing and coordinating “laws, programs and government activities relating to domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student assistance within the jurisdiction of other committees.”\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2025?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings\n\nEverything to Know About the 2025 Emirates NBA Cup",

    "description": "Like so many Lafayette immigrant stories, Judge Randy Williams’ story involved a love and Purdue University.",
    "fullText": "Anyone who ever spent any time in Tippecanoe Superior 1 over the last 17 years likely noticed Judge Randy Williams’ upstate New York accent. Sometimes, it's hard to miss.\n\nEven though Williams has lived here for nearly 40 years, his accent persists.\n\nSo how does a New Yorker settle in small-town Indiana?\n\nLike so many immigrant stories of Lafayette transplants, Williams’ story involved a love and Purdue.\n\nAs a young attorney practicing first in Albany, New York, and later in his hometown of Rome, New York, Williams never imagined a career in a mostly quiet Midwestern city.\n\nThat was before he met and dated Shay Daley.\n\n“Shay came out here in the summer '87, starting with her master's program in clinical psychology,” Williams said, noting he was working for a law firm in Rome. “We had the long-distance thing going on.\n\n“And at one point, I think the suggestion was, ‘Well, why don't you move out here?’ And I said, ‘I'm not going to move out there unless we're married.’\"\n\nSo much for a surprise engagement.\n\n“We got engaged in March of '88, got married in July of '88,” Williams recalled.\n\nThey honeymooned, and then Williams moved to Lafayette, where he briefly lived the life of an unemployed lawyer.\n\n“Now, honestly, did I think I'd be here, you know, 37 years?” Williams rhetorically asked. “Once I did get here, there were a few (law) firms that thought, ‘Oh, you're just here. You're a short-timer, so why would we even bother?’ I think that was the attitude.”\n\nTo earn money, Williams started substitute teaching. During a world civics class, they were studying Rome — the empire in Europe and Africa, not his hometown.\n\nWhen he shared with the students he was from Rome, they started asking him how an unemployed attorney found himself substitute teaching in front of a Jefferson High School class. Long story short, one of the students, Annie Deets, was in the class.\n\nThe next day, Williams got a call from a local attorney and Annie Deets's father, Charles, who interviewed him and hired him.\n\nFor the next 17 years, Williams built his career here as an attorney, first at Deets law firm then at Ball Eggleston law firm.\n\n“Maybe at that point, I was thinking we'll stay around a while,” he joked of his early days in the community as he built his law practice.\n\nThrough the years, Williams and Daley bought a house, which was only supposed to be their five-year home, he said. They still live there today after more than 35 years. They became parents there to a daughter, Rachel, and a son, Sam.\n\nHe started an unofficial career as a soccer coach, first for his daughter's team, then for other teams. He'd played four years of soccer at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, back in the 1970s when the game's popularity was low, so he knew more than most about the game.\n\nHe retired three times from coaching soccer before it finally stuck in 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nAs for notable cases while he was a defense attorney, none stands out, he said. “I was unassuming,” he joked.\n\nWilliams' law career took a turn in 2008.\n\n“It was time,\" Williams said of his run for Tippecanoe Superior 1 judge. \"There was a court that was going to be open, and I had done a lot of work in here as a (temporary) judge. I had tried cases. I had been reversed.\"\n\nWilliams didn't see running for judge as an entitlement or a calling.\n\n“There wasn't the thought that this is what I was was born and raised to do. It wasn't,\" he said. \"I thought I could help, I guess.\"\n\nRunning for public office required his family consent, he said.\n\n“There were family discussions because, you know, if your dad becomes a judge, you may hear things, you may read things, see things that you may not like. Is that something you'll be OK with?” he said recalling the family talks before his run for office.\n\nThrough the 17 years on the bench, Williams said most of the cases stand out for one reason or another, but he chose not to comment on any specific cases. In some, there might be post-conviction motions pending.\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 16, friends, colleagues, peers and well-wishers stopped by the Superior 1 courtroom to celebrate Williams's retirement with him.\n\nIndiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush was among those who visited, as were defense attorneys, other judges, deputy prosecutors, bailiffs, and many of Williams's friends.\n\nSteve Meyer, who plans to retire as Tippecanoe Superior 2 judge next year, worked with Williams at the Ball Eggleston law firm, where they molded a friendship that continued in their respective roles as judges.\n\nMeyer attended Williams's retirement shindig Friday, Jan. 16 — two days before a gunman shot Meyer and his wife, Kim. Both are going to make a full recovery.\n\nBut the shooting, as well as Meyer's participation in this profile, made it seem necessary to postpone publishing this story until it was known whether Meyer and his wife would be OK.\n\nMeyer and Williams came up through their careers as defense attorneys.\n\nMeyer telephoned Williams on Jan. 20, two days after the shooting, Williams said last week.\n\n“It was like the weight of the world had been lifted from my shoulders to hear him,” Williams said. “It’s good to hear him.”\n\nThe shooting caused ripple effects for judges throughout the state, and Rush, a Lafayette resident, has spoken with the state's judges and justices about the situation.\n\nProsecutors allege that Meyer's shooting was a criminal gang activity intended to stop Thomas Moss' Jan. 20 trial on gun, domestic battery and criminal recklessness.\n\nCases are randomly assigned to courts, and Williams recognized that Meyer's shooting could have been happened to any judge to whom the case was assigned.\n\n“I don’t want to think about it too much,” Williams said about the random draw. “I’ll be a little more cautious now.”\n\nInitially, Williams wondered whether the shooting might be political because Meyer is the only Democrat judge.\n\n“You don’t know. You just don’t know,” he said, referring to the strife and division in society at this point in history. “It’s a scary thing.”\n\nThe judges have pulled together to keep Tippecanoe Superior 2 on track with hearings and trials.\n\n“We’re just so glad that he’ll be back. We don’t know when,” Williams said. “I think the judges have stayed strong and done a really nice job.\"\n\n“He's a good friend, and he's probably my closest friend in the local judiciary,” Meyer said during a Jan. 12 interview in his office.\n\n“He's a great sounding board because when things happen, I know I can always go to him and maybe run an idea by or discuss an issue, and he does the same with me,\" Meyer said in an interview before the shooting. \"I always get, I think, reliable, sound feedback that I appreciate.”\n\n“I'm actually going to miss seeing him on regular basis and miss his advice and sounding board,\" Meyer said.\n\nBefore Meyer became Judge Meyer, he at times defended clients in Williams's court.\n\n“I think he always had a pretty good temperament, pretty fair and balanced, and I always knew that I'd get a good hearing there,” Meyer said.\n\nTippecanoe County Prosecutor Pat Harrington became familiar with Williams while they were both up-and-coming defense attorneys.\n\n“He is a solid judge,\" Harrington said. “He is always consistent in his interpretation of the law, and he's always polite.”\n\n“Today we go into court on high-tech crime evidence, and some of the evidence comes in with the stipulation with the defense attorney because it's science,\" Harrington said.\n\nBefore cell-phone data and electronic data were accepted as science, legal precedent had to be set for how to admit that data into evidence.\n\n“The landmark case that set the legal standard for the high-tech crime unit's cell-phone, electronic data, it was his case,\" Harrington said. \"He made all those evidentiary decisions.\"\n\nThose decisions were upheld by the Indiana Supreme Court.\n\nBefore Williams's retirement celebration in his courtroom on Jan. 16, he was in his office boxing up decades of mementos, including those from his days coaching soccer and keepsakes from his lifelong passion for baseball and the New York Yankees.\n\nHarry Rocheville, a bailiff at the courthouse, a Boston Red Sox fan and a retired police officer from Salem, Massachusetts, walked into the office that afternoon with a box labeled \"Yankees Junk!\"\n\nRed Sox fans generally are not fond of the Yankees or their fans.\n\n“The only bad thing about Judge Williams is he’s a Yankees’ fan,” Rocheville jokingly said weeks earlier.\n\nIronically, Williams's son, Sam, turned out to be a Red Sox fan.\n\n'It wouldn't be a father-son relationship if we didn't have something like that,\" Williams joked.\n\nAs a kid, Williams watched his idol, famed New York Yankee Mickey Mantle, play in the 1960s, but he never was able to meet him. He has a baseball card collection that includes most, if not all, of Mantle's cards.\n\nWilliams admitted he's fortunate to have seen the Yankees play in every stadium they've had, and he has some treasured signed baseballs and a Yankees' ticket stub from the last season they used paper tickets.\n\nWilliams' love of baseball is well known by those who know him or visited his office.\n\nHe played shortstop during his four years at Hamilton College, and played summer ball when school wasn't in session.\n\nEven though he's lived in Lafayette for nearly 40 years, he still makes it back to watch the Yankees.\n\nWhen the Journal & Courier interviewed Williams in December, he pointed to a corner of his office, where he had a 5-foot wooden sculpture representing Babe Ruth.\n\n\"Shay got me that one year for Christmas,\" Williams said of the Babe Ruth sculpture. \"She said, 'It can't stay home.' So I had that over in my office over at Ball Eggleston.\"\n\nHe had no idea where he's going to put it now that he's retired.\n\nA bookcase on a wall in his office had a Yankees' cap hanging on one end and a pitted and scuffed batting helmet on the other end.\n\nWilliams' keepsake helmet is from his college days, and he was wearing it in practice when a loose pitch came his way.\n\n“I got beaned,” Williams said of the pitch that hit him in the side of the head. “We then changed to flaps.”\n\nOfficially, Williams is retired now, but he's still frequently in the office.\n\nUnofficially, he'll continue to be on the judicial benches in Indiana serving as a senior judge where needed. He also has a few Superior 1 cases he needs to tidy up.\n\nHe also plans to continue to teach at Purdue University. His wife, Shay, is not retiring, Williams said.\n\nThe voters will choose Williams's replacement in the November elections. Until then, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun appointed Kevin McDaniel to fill out his term. Before he was appointed, McDaniel filed to run for Tippecanoe Superior 1 judge.\n\nReach Ron Wilkins at rwilkins@jconline.com.

    "fullText": "In-person interactions break down barriers in east London, as AI startups also try to bridge communication divide\n\nWesley Hartwell raised his fists to the barista and shook them next to his ears. He then lowered his fists, extended his thumbs and little fingers, and moved them up and down by his chest, as though milking a cow. Finally, he laid the fingers of one hand flat on his chin and flexed his wrist forward.\n\nHartwell, who has no hearing problems, had just used BSL, British Sign Language, to order his morning latte with normal milk at the deaf-run Dialogue Cafe, based at the University of East London, and thanked Victor Olaniyan, the deaf barista.\n\n“I have to be honest: when this cafe first opened near my office, I avoided it because the whole idea made me anxious,” said Hartwell, a lecturer at the university. “But now I’m fascinated. Sign language is amazing. I’m thinking of taking a course so I can learn more.”\n\nWhat gave Hartwell the confidence to try BSL was the cafe’s touchscreen menu. Instead of just listing the coffees and cakes on sale, the menus show videos of their BSL translation.\n\nFor many deaf BSL users, this kind of direct access is crucial. BSL is a first language for tens of thousands of people in the UK.\n\nOlaniyan, who has worked at the cafe for five years and now does shifts alongside a degree in accounting and management at the University of Reading, seemed mildly amused by the reactions of hearing people to the video menu.\n\n“I was brought up by hearing people, so I have no problem in the hearing world,” he signed. “But hearing people often feel anxious communicating with us. If this technology helps them, that’s great, but I’m fine as I am.”\n\nIn the past two years, there has been an explosion of digital and AI-linked products aiming to bridge communication barriers between the deaf and hearing worlds, from signing avatars to large generative models that aspire to rival mainstream AI platforms.\n\nIndependent evaluations of many of these systems remain limited, however, and sign language researchers caution that current tools still struggle with linguistic nuance, regional variation and context, particularly in high-stakes settings such as healthcare and law.\n\nBut the ambitions are striking: the UK startup Silence Speaks has built an avatar-based system that converts text into BSL, claiming it can convey contextual meaning and emotional cues.\n\nThe British project SignGPT, backed by £8.45m in funding, is developing models to translate between BSL and English in both directions, while also building what it describes as the largest sign languages dataset in the world.\n\nSign languages AI research has also become increasingly collaborative and international: a new £3.5m UK-Japan research project is developing systems trained on natural deaf-to-deaf conversation data rather than interpreter recordings.\n\nMuch of this recent progress has come quickly. When Prof Bencie Woll, a co-investigator of the SignGPT project at University College London’s Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, first entered the field of BSL research, communication beyond face-to-face interaction was extremely limited for deaf people.\n\n“The rest of the world was moving ahead with technology, but deaf people were often left behind,” she said. “What’s different now is the pace. In the last couple of years, the deaf community has benefited from an explosively powerful mix of possibilities.”\n\nHistorically, technology has not always been positive, Woll cautioned. “There has often been a fantasy, particularly among researchers who don’t understand sign languages, that it is a quick fix. That you take a sign language, turn it into written English – and you’ve made deaf people’s lives wonderful,” she said.\n\nThat assumption led to what Woll described as “really terrible technology”, including wearable translation suits, bulky gloves and head-mounted cameras designed to process signing.\n\n“All of these were doomed to failure,” she said, “because they were designed by people who did not understand sign languages and did not ask deaf people what they wanted, let alone work alongside deaf experts from the start. The community has been frustrated for years by the proliferation of bad solutions.”\n\nYet the need for solutions is real. About 70 million people worldwide are deaf or hard of hearing. In the UK, census data records about 151,000 BSL users. For roughly 25,000 of them, BSL is their primary language. It is a distinct, natural language with its own grammar and structure, not a signed version of English.\n\nFor this group, written and spoken English is often a second – or even a third language, following lip-reading, Sign Supported English or family-invented gestures.\n\nThis has practical consequences: subtitles and written text are not always adequate substitutes for direct BSL access. A large 2017 study of deaf children aged 10 to 11 found that reading ability was significantly below expected age levels for 48% of deaf children educated using spoken language only, and for 82% of those whose everyday language was a sign language.\n\nDr Lauren Ward has the unusual role of leading on AI technology for the deaf community at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), advising government and industry.\n\n“The pace of change has been so fast that RNID has made the unusual decision to employ engineers,” she said. “The potential to help the deaf community is huge – but so is the potential to cause harm.”\n\nDeaf people have long been early adopters of technology: SMS messaging transformed communication in the 1990s. But Ward said the last two years had brought a new intensity of interest and concern. “It has suddenly moved from university labs into startups and commercial products,” she said.\n\nThis shift has been enabled by advances in machine learning and related technologies that finally make the processing of large-scale sign languages technically possible.\n\nIncreased research funding, improved datasets and greater involvement from deaf researchers have also quickened the pace, as has a wider acknowledgment of the longstanding gap between the access deaf people are legally entitled to and what is delivered in practice: reliable sign languages provision has been promised for decades but has all-too-often failed to materialise.\n\nThis combination of opportunity and risk makes the current moment a double-edged sword, Ward said.\n\n“It is incredibly exciting, and the next five years could bring real improvements,” she said. “But there is a danger that private companies respond by focusing on profit rather than working with the deaf community and being led by them.”\n\nDr Maartje De Meulder, a deaf scholar and consultant on sign languages AI, agreed the stakes were high.\n\n“At the moment, deaf people are largely excluded from vast amounts of online information, from educational videos to government websites,” she said. “No one is ever going to have the resources to translate the entire internet into sign languages, so even partial solutions could be transformative.”\n\nNeil Fox, a deaf research fellow at the University of Birmingham, agreed that if avatar translation reached sufficient quality, it could open up many online spaces currently closed to deaf users.\n\nBut all are highly cautious. Rebecca Mansell, the chief executive of the British Deaf Association, said this “has become a very lucrative area and too many projects involve deaf people only tokenistically”.\n\n“It is all happening very fast, and there is a real risk that solutions will be imposed on us,” she added.\n\nMansell also raised concerns about regulation and appropriate use. “An avatar might be fine for ordering something simple,” she said, “but what about a cancer diagnosis? In schools, a human interpreter is often the only friend a deaf child has.”\n\nDr Louise Hickman, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy and lead author of the report BSL Is Not For Sale, has worked in AI ethics for a decade.\n\n“Many companies claim they can solve these problems without understanding the linguistic and cultural complexity of BSL,” she said. “Current avatar systems still lack the nuance of human interpreters, which creates risks in medical and legal settings.”\n\nHickman also pointed to the limits of available data. “British Sign Language is not the same as Irish Sign Language or American Sign Language. There are regional dialects within England. This means the data available for training AI systems is extremely limited.”\n\nSo where, she asked, will appropriate training data come from?\n\n“The deaf community wants innovation,” she said, “but we want to slow this down so we can shape it and make sure it genuinely benefits us.”\n\nBack at the cafe, Hakan Elbir, its founder, saw little need for more complex tools than his static BSL video menu.\n\n“People talk a lot about innovation, but for most deaf people it is still theoretical,” he said. “What I wanted was a meaningful daily interaction for hearing people.”\n\n“Coffee is just the excuse,” he added. “I didn’t need complicated technology to break down barriers. I just needed people to interact openly.”\n\nWaiting for his latte at the counter, Hartwell quietly practised the sign for “flat white”, proving that it was this simple, human interaction – supported but not overshadowed by technology – that was drawing him back, one signed coffee order at a time.",

    "fullText": "The shooting deaths of white protesters Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal officers in Minneapolis followed a playbook that is painfully familiar to Black Americans: Authorities quickly moved to disparage the victims, only to be contradicted as more evidence emerged.\n\nBlack families who have lost loved ones to police violence said the killings in Minnesota have brought back painful memories of their own fights for justice as law enforcement agencies spun up narratives to suggest officers had no other choice but to kill their relatives.\n\nAnd these law enforcement agencies often make no effort to publicly correct misstatements or falsehoods that might have impact on a fair justice process, experts said.\n\nTimothy Welbeck, the director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University, said it “regrettably” took the deaths of Pretti and Good to again shine a spotlight on this issue.\n\n“Black people have leveled a critique against law enforcement for as long as we’ve had policing in America,” said Welbeck, an assistant professor at Temple’s Africology and African American Studies Department.\n\nHe also called it “painfully ironic” that Pretti and Good died in “the same place” where other high-profile cases brought the issue to the fore: George Floyd, who was murdered in 2020 by a Minneapolis police officer, and Philando Castile, who was fatally shot in 2016 as he tried to show a suburban Minneapolis police officer his license to carry a concealed firearm.\n\nClarence Castile, an uncle of Philando Castile, said it was eerie to hear federal authorities make snap conclusions in the Pretti and Good shootings.\n\n“Right away they backed up their officers and said they had justifiable shoots, their lives were in danger, they feared for their lives,” Castile said. “I heard the same thing, (officials) said the same things when that cop shot my nephew.”\n\n“We know, from the beginning, that they haven’t taken the time to investigate,\" he said. \"They’re just putting out something, because they think they have to respond. Sometimes the best response is no response.”\n\n‘Protecting the integrity of the investigation’\n\nLeonard Sipes, who worked for 35 years in public affairs and communications for federal and state law enforcement agencies and is also a former officer, said the standard practice for shootings or any other major breaking case is to simply state that “it's under investigation.” Sipes said he typically waited 24 hours before releasing information to the public.\n\n“Getting the story correct is vital to the reputation of the agency,” Sipes said. “You are also obligated to protect the integrity of the investigation. A rush to judgment can violate that.”\n\nThe killings of Pretti, a Veterans Affairs hospital ICU nurse, and Good, who described herself as a poet, mother and wife, quickly became rallying cries for Minnesotans protesting the largest surge of federal law enforcement into an American city.\n\nAfter Pretti and Good were killed, administration officials from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to President Donald Trump claimed the two were far-left radicals acting with malicious intent to harm federal officers.\n\n“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” Pretti’s family said in a statement this week, noting that videos showed Pretti holding his phone, not a gun, when he was tackled by federal agents before he was shot several times. “Please get the truth out about our son.”\n\nGood was remembered by her family as “the beautiful light of our family and brought joy to anyone she met.”\n\n“She was our protector, our shoulder to cry on and our scintillating source of joy.”\n\nWhile Justice Department officials have declined to launch a civil rights investigation into Good’s death, on Friday they announced a civil rights probe into Pretti’s killing.\n\nStill, officials have not walked back claims that Pretti and Good were avowed extremists who intended to harm federal agents when they were killed.\n\nFrustration over past and present cases\n\nSome Black activists and police reform advocates expressed frustration that people who are outraged by how the Pretti and Good cases have been handled often ignored the same dynamics when the victims were Black.\n\n“Ultimately, this demonstrates the insidious nature of racism and how it’s embedded its ways into the systems and structures of society,” Welbeck said. “When Black people try to point out not only the logical fallacies of it, but just the callousness of it, we were often lambasted or told that we were overreacting and needed to wait for justice to play itself out.”\n\nMelina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Grassroots, said it’s a common misconception that Black racial justice organizers won’t get active when white people die at the hands of law enforcement.\n\n“I want to be very clear that I mourn and rage about the murder of Alex Pretti and Renée Good,” said Abdullah, organizer of a national hub for BLM chapters. “What they suffered is what Black people suffer every single day, and it doesn’t make it right for them, but it’s also not right for us.”\n\nJustin Hansford, who participated in Black Lives Matter protests after the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, said the Minneapolis shootings should be a reminder to all Americans that injustice disproportionately impacting Black people can impact them, too.\n\n“It’s the idea that Black folks were always the ones whose experience signaled to the rest of the country what was soon to come,” said Hansford, a professor at the Howard University School of Law and executive director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center.\n\n“It was because this is the Black experience that you looked at it narrowly, and you failed to address it. And then the experience becomes mimicked nationally.”\n\nTulsa shooting victim's sister knows Minneapolis families' pain\n\nTiffany Crutcher, the twin sister of Terence Crutcher, a Black man killed in 2016 by a Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer, said she couldn’t watch videos showing the killings of Pretti and Good. Just hearing authorities speak about their deaths was re-traumatizing, she said.\n\nShe’s “been there before,” she said, recalling how law enforcement officials made snap judgements about her brother.\n\nCrutcher's family maintained that Terence was in need of help after his vehicle stalled on the road. The officer who fatally shot him claimed she feared he was reaching into his car for a weapon. Terence Crutcher was unarmed.\n\nVideo footage from the scene recorded an operator saying Terence “looks like a bad dude” who “could be on something.” Ultimately, the officer who shot him was acquitted at trial for manslaughter.\n\n“In our trauma and shock, we had to control the narrative about who Terrence was,” Tiffany said. “While we’re grieving and mourning, at the same time, we have to rally and let the world know that our loved one did not deserve to die.”\n\nShe said the Pretti and Good shootings are helping people wake up to the problem of unequal justice for people killed by police.\n\n“Naturally, there’s an affinity more broadly towards law enforcement and people believing them,\" Tiffany said. “However, I think that is shifting.”\n\n\"Our voice is all that we have. And we made a conscious decision that we were going to utilize our voice and get ahead of the harmful narratives.”\n\nAP writer Matt Brown in Washington, D.C., contributed.",

    "description": "Nearly three years after Holy Names University shut down amid declining enrollment and rising costs, the 60-acre campus in East Oakland is set to be reborn for a new purpose: housing.",
    "fullText": "Nearly three years after Holy Names University shut down amid declining enrollment and rising costs, the 60-acre campus nestled in the East Oakland hillside is set to be reborn for a new purpose: housing.\n\nOn Friday, BH Properties, which purchased the property in 2023 for $65 million, is expected to file an application to build 165 single-family homes on the property while retaining the university's 400-seat theater, as well as the iconic mid-century chapel and belltower designed by architect John Pflueger.\n\nLos Angeles-based BH Properties purchased the 60-acre campus in June 2023, just before a scheduled foreclosure after the university had defaulted on a $49 million loan. After purchasing it, the real estate investment firm worked without success to attract another educational institution, a tough sell in an environment where Bay Area colleges like Mills College and California College of the Arts and the San Francisco Art Institute have been going out of business after heavy post-pandemic financial losses.\n\n\"We believe in Oakland and are committed to transforming the former Holy Names campus into a win for the property, community and the city,\" Jim Brooks, president of BH Properties, said in a statement.\"This is a particularly compelling location, and we believe that homes of this type can be delivered in the near term.\"\n\nThe development represents a rare chance to build single-family homes in the East Bay's biggest city and to capitalize on a property defined by steep hillsides, deep ravines, flowering rose bushes, redwood groves, circling hawks and views of both the Bay Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge. About half of the 60-acre property will be preserved as open space, with meandering hiking trails and wooded areas where children can explore and build forts.\n\nThe plan for 165 market-rate single family homes will be consistent with surrounding densities with a variety of home sizes that match the campus and hillside environments.\n\nIn early designs, the existing campus footprint will be transformed into a clustered residential village surrounding the McClean Chapel and quad, with about 125 homes between 1,800 and 2,500 square feet. The steeper hillside will be more sparsely developed with about 40 larger homes, likely 2,500 to 3,000 square feet.\n\nIn a statement, BH said the community \"will become a place for families, empty nesters, and singles alike to enjoy the richness and fullness of life the college campus affords.\"\n\nBH Properties is working with development advisor Tidewater Capital on the proposed plans for the former campus,\n\n\"Holy Names is an incredible location surrounded by a mature hillside neighborhood,\" said Kyle Winkler, development director at Tidewater Capital. \"The plan is in its early stages, but adds much needed housing that will mirror the look and feel of the surrounding neighborhood.\"\n\nThe proposal calls for the bell tower and chapel to be preserved as a library and communal space, while the campus quad remains as a central gathering place. The performing arts theater, which was built in 1993, is envisioned as a hub for culture and enrichment available to the broader community with performances, talks and classes overseen by a nonprofit, the developer said.\n\nFormer Oakland City Councilmember Dick Spees, who served the neighborhood for 24 years, compared the Holy Names property to Oakland's Chabot Space & Science Center, which he founded. Spees previously served on the board of Holy Names University.\n\n\"Holy Names is one of Oakland's most special places, shaped by its hills, trees and long civic legacy,\" he said. \"I learned through projects like the Chabot Space & Science Center that the best development respects its setting, serves the community and thinks generations ahead. Oakland is at its best when growth is guided by care, balance and long-term thinking - and this project reflects exactly that.\"\n\nAfter the application is submitted the developer says it plans to launch a community engagement process, working with city officials and neighbors on refining the plan.\n\nThe project comes as another noteworthy Oakland education-to-housing project - the 448-unit redevelopment of the former CCA campus in Rockridge - is stalled because of financial infeasibility.\n\nIf approved, the Holy Names the project would be Oakland's second largest single-family home project. The largest, the 918-home redevelopment of the former Oak Knolls Naval Medical Center, has been delayed for three decades, mired in controversy and false starts. The current owner had said infrastructure work could start this year.\n\nThis article originally published at Exclusive: Former Bay Area university campus to be converted into single family housing.",

    "fullText": "EVANSVILLE, Ind. (WEHT) — Despite a program first from star guard Camryn Runner, the University of Evansville women’s basketball team couldn’t outlast Belmont in overtime.\n\nThe Purple Aces had the Bruins’ back against the wall late in the fourth quarter with a five point lead following a three-pointer by Sydney Huber. But three costly turnovers and missed free throws helped Belmont send the game into overtime tied at 59.\n\nIn OT, UE got on the board first, but foul trouble put the game in the Bruins’ hands. Belmont shot a total of 16 free throws in the full five minutes of overtime outscoring the Purple Aces in the quarter by six. Evansville dropped the game 79-73.\n\n“There’s no question that some losses hurt worse than others,” said head coach Robyn Scherr. “And you know if I had to choose between two types of losses, I’d take this one over getting beat by 20. So you know again I think we’re proving a lot to ourselves right now about who we can compete with. And so you know there was a ton of positives in this game to take from, and then there are things we’re going to learn from too and hopefully clean up. And hopefully that’ll help us down the road.”\n\nRunner recorded the first triple-double in program history with 19 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. While Georgia Cox continued her recent strong play, scoring a career high 23 points to go along with four assists. Huber knocked down three three-pointers to round out the group with 11 points. Worth noting star guard Logan Luebbers Palmer missed her third straight game.\n\nEvansville will be back in action Sunday, February 1st, against Indiana State in Meeks Family Fieldhouse at 3 p.m. The game is set to stream on ESPN Plus.",

    "fullText": "There are a lot of reasons Nick Saban is revered in Tuscaloosa.\n\nBut if you really want to understand who Nick Saban is, who he has always been, you don’t have to look at trophies or banners hanging inside Bryant-Denny Stadium.\n\nYou look at moments like this one.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nick and Terry Saban sat down with Alabama Governor Kay Ivey to talk about the future of kids.\n\nGovernor Ivey said it best when she shared how much time and energy the Sabans continue to pour into young people and their opportunities. And that’s the part that hits hardest, because Nick Saban didn’t have to do this.\n\nIt was great to have Coach and Ms. Terry Saban in my office.\n\nThey have always taken the time and energy to invest in young people and their futures.\n\nI look forward to Alabama students soon immersing themselves in STEM education and the arts at the Saban Center. #alpolitics pic.twitter.com/aTjYmTbeGM\n\n— Governor Kay Ivey (@GovernorKayIvey) January 28, 2026\n\nHe doesn’t need another project.\n\nHe doesn’t need another ribbon-cutting or photo op.\n\nHis name is already etched into history forever.\n\nThat’s not coincidence. That’s character.\n\nThe Saban Center isn’t just another building going up in Tuscaloosa.\n\nIt’s a first-of-its-kind learning campus designed to bring STEM education, the arts, innovation, and imagination under one roof, where students don’t just learn, but discover. Where curiosity is encouraged. Where confidence is built. Where leadership begins before a kid even realizes what leadership looks like.\n\nBecause Nick Saban has always understood something deeper than wins and losses: opportunity changes lives.\n\nThis campus will house the State of Alabama STEM Hub. It will be home to the Tuscaloosa Children’s Theatre. It will include IGNITE, formerly the Children’s Hands-On Museum, giving kids hands-on experiences that spark creativity and wonder.\n\nNot memorization. Not test scores. Real engagement.\n\nAnd maybe the most poetic part of all? The Saban Center will be built using only Alabama-sourced materials.\n\nThat’s Nick Saban in a nutshell.\n\nFor decades, we watched him develop young men on the football field, teaching discipline, accountability, resilience, and belief.\n\nWe watched players arrive as teenagers and leave as leaders.\n\nWe watched assistants learn under him, grow under pressure, and go on to shape programs of their own.\n\nBut this? This is bigger than football.\n\nThis is Nick and Miss Terry saying, “We’re not done.”\n\nThey’re saying that Tuscaloosa isn’t just a place where championships were won, it’s a place where futures will be built.\n\nThat Alabama’s kids deserve world-class resources. That innovation and creativity belong here, not somewhere else.\n\nThe Saban Center is set to open in 2027. And when it does, generations of students, many of whom may never wear a helmet or step onto a field, will benefit from the same belief Nick Saban has always had in people: that if you give them the right environment, they’ll rise to the challenge.\n\nNick Saban changed college football forever.\n\nBut what he’s doing now, what he’s always done, might matter even more.\n\nHe’s building something that lasts.\n\nAnd once again, he’s reminding us why Tuscaloosa will always be better because he chose to call it home.\n\nBut a man who never stopped caring.",

    "fullText": "Members of a motorcycle club and a street gang clearly targeted an Indiana judge for assassination, police said Tuesday, days after officers arrested five people in connection with the attack.\n\nPolice and prosecutors at a news conference praised what they characterized as a relentless effort to track down who opened fire on Tippecanoe County Superior Court Judge Steven Meyer and his wife, Kim, at their home in Lafayette on Jan. 18. Both Meyer and his wife suffered gunshot wounds but survived.\n\nThe Lafayette Police Department, the FBI, the Indiana State Police and the Purdue University Police Department launched a search for the shooter that went on for days before apprehending five people in synchronized arrests Thursday evening, including four in Indiana and one in Lexington, Kentucky. Court appearances for the suspects were set for Wednesday in Indiana and Kentucky.\n\n“This attack was more than an assault on two citizens,” LaFayette Police Chief Scott Galloway said. “This was an assault on the rule of law itself.”\n\nProsecutors allege that the attack was designed to derail a domestic abuse case against Thomas Moss, a member of the Detroit-based Phantom MC motorcycle club with ties to the Vice Lords street gang.\n\nAccording to a probable cause affidavit, the Vice Lords offered the victim in the case $10,000 not to testify against Moss but she refused.\n\nWith Moss' trial set to begin on Jan. 20 in front of Meyer, another Phantom MC member, Blake Smith, purchased a shotgun. A masked man traveled to the Meyers' home armed with that shotgun on Jan. 18. He lured the couple to the door by saying he was looking for his dog, shot them through the door and fled.\n\n“(Meyer) was targeted,” Indiana State Police Lt. Col. Al Williamson said at Tuesday's news conference. “They went after him for a reason.”\n\nPolice recovered the mask, the shooter's clothing and the shotgun discarded near the Meyers' home. DNA on the mask matched Raylen Ferguson, an associate of the Almighty Vice Lord Nation from Lexington, Kentucky, according to the affidavit.\n\nSurveillance video showed a car that was parked near the Meyers' home had traveled from Kentucky toward Lafayette on Jan. 16 and traveled toward Smith's residence in the hour after the shootings, according to the affidavit.\n\nMoss, Ferguson and Smith each face multiple charges, including attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Amanda Milsap, whom prosecutors allege offered the bribe in the domestic abuse case, faces bribery and obstruction counts. Zeneda Greer, a woman Ferguson lives with, has been charged with helping a criminal and obstruction. Prosecutors have accused her of traveling to Lafayette with Ferguson.\n\nMilsap's attorney, Earl McCoy, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Online court records did not list attorneys for Moss, Ferguson or Blake. Jail records indicate Greer is being held in Lexington. Online court records in that state did not list an attorney for her.",

    "fullText": "Wisconsin hosted a big Junior Day event over the weekend as coach Luke Fickell looks to jumpstart the 2027 recruiting class. Rivals has the latest on how the weekend went and prospects the Badgers are trending with early.\n\nFour-star Waconia (Minn.) Shakopee defensive lineman Nehemiah Ombati was one of the top-rated prospects on campus for Junior Day. He really enjoyed his time on campus.\n\n“I thought the visit went great! My time in Madison was well spent but the part of the visit that stood out to me the most was the position meeting with Coach Whitlow,” Ombati said. “I got to understand the game at an even higher level after meeting with him privately.”\n\nThose moments with Whitlow will stick with the defender for some time.\n\n“It was honestly one of the biggest parts of my recruiting process that I’ll always remember,” he said. “The biggest thing  I took from that meeting was that I’ve been taking the right steps to be in my best possible position come freshman year.”\n\nThe Minnesota native will be on the West Coast this weekend for visits to USC and UCLA.\n\nHinsdale (Ill.) Central four-star defensive lineman Tommy Riordan spent time in Madison too. The coaching staff was a standout for the Illinois native.\n\n“The visit was awesome. The entire staff did a great job with scheduling our day,” Riordan said. “We started the day with a 30 minute meeting with Coach Fickell. Also had individual meetings with Coach Mitchel and Tressel. They took us through the new indoor facility that’s still under construction, it’s huge and has underground parking for the players.”\n\nThe overall message from coach Fickell also resonated with Riordan.\n\n“Coach addressed Wisconsin’s academics and culture and how those are large parts of the Badgers’ identity,” Riordan said. “It was my first time meeting with Coach so I got to know more about him and his family. We spoke about me being a multi-sport athlete playing football, lacrosse and track. Overall it was a great conversation.”\n\nHunter Mallinger was back on campus again last weekend. The people are the biggest reason he keeps coming back.\n\n“Wisconsin was awesome. Mainly just the people stood out. I love the new staff hires with coach Mateos,” Mallinger said.\n\n“I think they are doing everything right there. Also, I loved hanging out with some of the older guys who have been through this experience before and why they chose Wisconsin. I really liked talking to the strength coach and hearing what he has to say about their program. Overall it was just another great experience!”\n\nOne of the very unique things about this visit is that his brother Reece was offered by Wisconsin on the visit. That was a special moment for the family.\n\n“It was great seeing him earn his offer.  This was one that he was waiting for, for a long time now,” Hunter said. “We were kind of losing hope since we were told he would get one a few games into his junior season which turned into a few more games and a few more. And then the whole staff change at the oline position really made all of us wonder what would come from this. Everything so far though has been positive and it’s great that we both have the opportunity to play for our home town Badgers.\n\nThe brothers have stated they’d like to play together so this puts the Badgers squarely in the mix for both. The RPM is certainly trending that way and I’m close to making a pick of my own.\n\nWisconsin, Minnesota, Northwestern, Kansas and Indiana are all in contention for official visits for both. But it’ll be tough to make them all this summer.",

If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide and needs support now, call or text 988 or chat with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988lifeline.org.\n\nStanford and the family of Katie Meyer have settled a wrongful death lawsuit concerning the former soccer star's death by suicide in 2022.\n\nStanford and Meyer's family issued a joint statement Monday announcing the settlement. Meyer's family filed the lawsuit in November 2022, eight months after Meyer's death. It stated that \"the actions that led to the death of Katie Meyer began and ended with Stanford University.\"\n\nPer the lawsuit, Meyer faced disciplinary action from the university at the time of her death due to an allegation that she spilled coffee on a football player who was accused of sexually assaulting one of her teammates.\n\nThe lawsuit stated that a disciplinary letter from Stanford's office of community standards to Meyer \"contained threatening language regarding sanctions and potential 'removal from the university.'\" Per the lawsuit, Meyer received the letter on the night of her death.\n\nAt the time, Stanford spokesperson Dee Mostofi disputed the lawsuit's claim that the university was responsible for Meyer's death in statements to media.\n\nMonday's announcement did not disclose the terms of the settlement, but it did announce initiatives put in place in Meyer's honor.\n\n\"To honor Katie, Stanford will collaborate with Katie’s family to launch an initiative focused on the mental health and well-being of student-athletes at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute,\" the statement reads. \"Stanford Athletics will establish the Katie Meyer Leadership Award to be given to an exceptional Stanford student-athlete each year.\"\n\nThe statement also announced that Stanford will amend its disciplinary procedures to meet a California Law named after Meyer requiring that students in the the state's public college system have access to an independent adviser of their choice when facing a disciplinary hearing. Stanford is private and not subject to the law.\n\n\"In addition, Stanford will adopt the principles of Katie Meyer’s Law to provide support to students in its OCS disciplinary process,\" the statement reads.\n\nStanford women's soccer will retire Meyer's No. 19, per the agreement.\n\nMeyer was the starting goaltender on the 2019 Stanford team that won the NCAA championship. She came up with critical saves in a penalty shootout to secure Stanford's win over North Carolina in the title game.",

Kernodle was stabbed 67 times.\n\nThis is according to a newly unsealed supplemental filing from prosecutors in the case regarding expert testimony that was obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nThe report does not contain the full autopsy reports for the four victims, only key findings.\n\nGoncalves and Mogen were found together in Mogen's bedroom.\n\nThe autopsy report determined that both young women died from multiple sharp force injuries, with additional contributors to Goncalves' death including blunt force injuries of the head and asphyxial injuries.\n\nShe had at least 24 stab and incised wounds of the scalp, face and neck; 11 stab and incised wounds of the chest; and three stab and incised wounds of the upper extremities.\n\nThere were also punctures on the outer table of the skull, injuries to the teeth and tongue, and a hemorrhage into the chest cavities, according to the filing.\n\nThe blunt force injuries suffered by Goncalves include scalp lacerations, bleeding around the brain, nasal fracture, bruising around the eyes, and patterned bruising extended across the lower face.\n\nMogen suffered 13 stab incisions to the scalp face and neck; five stab wounds of the chest; and 10 incised wounds of the upper extremities, per the court filing.\n\nThe report states there were also wounds to the lung and liver, perforations of the subclavian vein, artery, and blood vessels of the chest wall, and an incision of the nasal septum.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nChapin and Kernodle were found in Kernodle's room, with Ethan in the bed and Kernodle on the floor.\n\nThe cause of death for the couple was also multiple sharp force injuries.\n\nChapin had one stab wound of the upper chest; four stab and incised wounds of the scalp face and neck; six incised wounds of the upper extremities; and six stab and incised wounds of the lower extremities.\n\nHe also had perforations of the jugular vein, subclavian vein, and subclavian artery.\n\nThose three victims were attacked as they slept and never stood up or had the chance to fight back, but Kernodle fought back.\n\nShe had abrasions and contusions of the head, torso and extremities along with: 23 stab and incised wounds of the scalp face and neck; seven stab wounds of the chest; four stab wounds of the abdomen; three incised and puncture wounds of the back; 25 incised wounds of the upper extremities; and five incised wounds of the lower extremities.\n\nThere were also punctures on the outer table of the skull; perforation of  the jugular vein, heart, lung, and pulmonary blood vessels; hemorrhage into the chest cavities; wounds extending into the bones of the right hand; and scrapes and bruises on the face, torso and extremities.\n\nKernodle also had blood on the bottom of her feet from moving around during her attack.\n\nIt was while examining the bodies that investigators found the evidence that broke the case open — the KA-ar knife sheath Kohberger left behind likely because Kernodle caught him in her roommate's room.\n\nThat sheath would provide the trace DNA used to link Kohberger to the crime scene.\n\nAfter murdering his four victims, Kohberger exited the home but he did not go unnoticed.\n\nThe killer locked eyes with one of the surviving roommates and the lone eyewitness in the case, Dylan Mortensen.\n\nThat eyewitness and his forgotten sheath are likely why Kohberger entered a guilty plea to four charges of first-degree murder back in July as part of a last-minute deal that allowed him to avoid the death penalty.\n\nKohberger stood in front of the court and told the judge he was entering a guilty plea before confessing to the murder of each of the four victims.\n\nKohberger is now serving four life sentences for those murders.",

    "fullText": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A lawyer for fired University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore declared his innocence Thursday and said charges of home invasion and stalking were based on an effort by a staff member to get a financial windfall from the school's “deep pockets.\"\n\nIn a court filing, defense attorney Ellen Michaels responded to allegations that shocked college football in December. It also signals that Moore, who was fired for a relationship with the staffer and arrested hours later, is fighting the charges and wants the case dismissed.\n\n“This Court is not confronted with a close call or a technical defect,” Michaels wrote. “It is confronted with a prosecution that never should have begun.”\n\nMoore was abruptly fired on Dec. 10 for having an inappropriate relationship and for lying during the university's investigation, his dismissal letter states.\n\nAuthorities say Moore later that day entered the woman’s apartment, blamed her for the firing and grabbed butter knives and kitchen scissors while threatening to kill himself.\n\nA prosecutor quoted Moore as telling the woman, “My blood is on your hands.”\n\nMoore, 39, has pleaded not guilty to charges of felony home invasion, stalking and illegal entry.\n\nMichaels said the warrant to arrest Moore was deeply flawed because police wrongly informed a magistrate that Moore had been stalking the woman for months and was dangerous.\n\nMichaels said police relied on misinformation from the woman's personal lawyer, Heidi Sharp, as it investigated what happened. Michaels doesn't dispute that Moore turned up at the woman's apartment, but she claims there's no evidence that she had told him to stay away.\n\n“A magistrate must be given a fair and accurate picture. When the picture is distorted, the warrant cannot stand,” Michaels wrote.\n\nShe accused Sharp of giving information to police to “villainize Mr. Moore and maximize the chances of obtaining a large settlement from the deep pockets of the University of Michigan.”\n\nA message seeking comment from Sharp was not immediately returned.\n\nEarlier Thursday, a judge held a hearing to get an update on the case. Michaels disclosed that she had filed the request to quash the arrest and would argue it at a future date.\n\nWashtenaw County assistant prosecutor Kati Rezmierski said she had just received the filing. The next hearing was set for Feb. 17.\n\nMoore arrived at the courthouse with his wife, Kelli and waited in an adjacent courtroom for his case to be called. He declined to comment but stood nearby when Michaels briefly spoke to reporters and said he's innocent.\n\nMoore coached the Wolverines for two seasons as the successor to Jim Harbaugh, who won a national championship before quitting to become coach of the NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nKyle Whittingham, who coached Utah for two decades, is the new Michigan coach.",

    "description": "The dispute began after the couple defended their right to heat palak paneer in a campus microwave.",
    "fullText": "A dispute that began over heating a dish in a microwave has ended with two Indian students winning a $200,000 settlement from a US university.\n\nAditya Prakash and his fiancee, Urmi Bhattacheryya, told the BBC they filed a civil rights lawsuit against the University of Colorado, Boulder, after they faced a series of \"microaggressions and retaliatory actions\" following the microwave incident.\n\nThe harassment began, the lawsuit alleged, after a university staff member objected to Prakash heating up his lunch of palak paneer - one of northern India's most popular dishes, made of pureed spinach and paneer (considered an Indian equivalent of cottage cheese) - in a microwave on campus, because of the way it smelled.\n\nIn response to the BBC's questions, the university said it could not comment on the \"specific circumstances\" surrounding the students' claims of discrimination and harassment due to privacy laws, but added it was \"committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all students, faculty and staff regardless of national origin, religion, culture and other classes protected under US laws and by university policies\".\n\n\"When these allegations arose in 2023, we took them seriously and adhered to established, robust processes to address them, as we do with all claims of discrimination and harassment. We reached an agreement with the students in September [2025] and deny any liability in this case,\" the university said.\n\nPrakash said for them, the point of the lawsuit was not the money. \"It was about making a point - that there are consequences to discriminating against Indians for their 'Indianness'.\"\n\nThe lawsuit has received significant media coverage in India since it was first reported last week, starting a conversation around what many have described as \"food racism\" in Western countries. Many Indians on social media have shared their own experiences of facing ridicule over their food habits abroad.\n\nSome have also pointed out that discrimination over food is rampant in India as well, where non-vegetarian food is banned in many schools and colleges over perceptions of it being impure or dirty. People from disadvantaged castes and north-eastern states often face bias over their food habits, with some complaining about the smell of the ingredients they use.\n\nAnd it's not just Indian or South Asian food - communities from Africa, Latin America and other parts of Asia have also shared their experiences of being shamed over their food habits.\n\nPrakash and Bhattacheryya claim their ordeal began in September 2023. Prakash, a PhD student in the Anthropology Department at the university, was microwaving his lunch of palak paneer when a British staff member allegedly remarked that his food was giving off a \"pungent\" odour and told him that there was a rule against heating foods with strong odours in that microwave.\n\nPrakash said the rule wasn't mentioned anywhere and when he later inquired about which foods were considered pungent, he was told that sandwiches were not, while curry was.\n\nPrakash alleged that the exchange was followed by a series of actions by the university which led to him and Bhattacheryya - who was also a PhD student there - losing their research funding, teaching roles and even the PhD advisers they had worked with for months.\n\nIn May 2025, Prakash and Bhattacheryya filed a lawsuit against the university, alleging discriminatory treatment and a \"pattern of escalating retaliation\" against them.\n\nIn September, the university settled the lawsuit. Such settlements are usually arrived at to avoid lengthy and expensive court battles for both parties.\n\nAccording to the terms of the settlement, the university agreed to give the students their degrees but denied all liabilities and banned them from studying or working there in future.\n\n'Indian food is terrible' tweet sparks hot debate\n\nIn its statement shared with the BBC, the university added: \"CU Boulder's Anthropology Department has worked to rebuild trust among students, faculty and staff. Among other efforts, department leaders met with graduate students, faculty and staff to listen and discuss changes that best support the department's efforts to foster an inclusive and supportive environment for all.\"\n\n\"Individuals who are determined to be responsible for violating university policies preventing discrimination and harassment are held accountable,\" it added.\n\nPrakash says that this isn't his first brush with discrimination over food.\n\nWhen he was growing up in Italy, his school teachers would often ask him to sit at a separate table during lunch breaks because his classmates found the smell of his food \"off-putting\", he says.\n\n\"Acts like isolating me from my European classmates or stopping me from using a shared microwave because of how my food smells are how white people control your Indianness and shrink the spaces you can exist in,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that there is a long history of food being used to put down Indian and other ethnic groups.\n\n\"The word 'curry' has been conflated with the 'smell' of marginalised communities who toil in kitchens and peoples' homes and has been turned into a pejorative term for 'Indian',\" he says.\n\nBhattacheryya says that even someone like former Vice-President Kamala Harris isn't immune to being insulted over food.\n\nShe points to a 2024 social media post by far-right activist Laura Loomer saying that if Harris became president, the White House \"will smell like curry\". Loomer has denied being racist.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Bhattacheryya also alleged she faced retaliation after she invited Prakash to speak as a guest lecturer on the topic of cultural relativism in her anthropology class. Cultural relativism is the view that no culture is superior or inferior to another as cultural practices of all groups exist within their own cultural context.\n\nDuring the lecture, Prakash says he shared several examples of food racism he had encountered, including the palak paneer incident, without naming anyone.\n\nBhattacheryya says that she also faced racist abuse when she posted a thread on X about the \"systemic racism\" she and Prakash were facing at the university in 2024.\n\nBelow the post, there are several comments supporting the couple but also ones that said, \"go back to India\", \"decolonisation was a mistake\" and \"it's not just the food, many of you don't bathe and we know\".\n\nPrakash and Bhattacheryya said what they wanted from the university was to be heard and understood; for their hurt and pain at being \"othered\" to be acknowledged and for amends to be made in a meaningful way.\n\nThey claim that they never received a meaningful apology from the university. The university did not respond to the BBC's question about this.\n\nThey have since returned to India and say that they might never go back to the US.\n\n\"No matter how good you are at what you do, the system is constantly telling you that because of your skin colour or your nationality, you can be sent back any time. The precarity is acute and our experience at the university is a good example of this,\" Prakash says.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Carson Beck was part of two national championship runs at Georgia.\n\nTo him, those seasons weren't as good as this one was for him at Miami.\n\nBeck's last pass as a college quarterback was an interception, one that essentially sealed Miami's fate in a 27-21 loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff national championship game on Monday night. He had to watch the Hoosiers celebrate on what was his home field, watch the turf littered in crimson-and-white confetti.\n\nAnd yet, when he reflected on the end of his journey, he declared this year at Miami the best of his life.\n\n“Yeah, it was,” Beck said after a 19-for-32 passing, 232-yard, one-touchdown, one-interception performance in the final. “And not because we made the national championship, not because won a bunch of football games or we made great plays or things of that sort. Man, for me, my whole entire life changed.\n\n\"You know, 365 days ago, I was in just a really dark place, and I was trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It was a really difficult thing. There was just a lot going on, mentally, physically, emotionally, to be able to battle and fight through the roller-coaster that life is.\"\n\nAt this time a year ago, Beck was no longer wanted at Georgia, his elbow had just been surgically rebuilt, every move of his personal life became social-media fodder and he knew the doubters were everywhere.\n\nHe almost got the last laugh. Beck started all 16 games for Miami, led the Hurricanes to a 13-3 mark and set a school record by completing 72.4% of his passes. The last pass was a bit underthrown, and there seemed to be some sort of miscommunication on the final play. (“Their defense played really well tonight,\" Beck said.) But Miami knew long before that play that without Beck, they wouldn't have gotten anywhere near the CFP title game.\n\n“He earned the respect of his teammates, teammates working hard with him,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “We win together, we lose together. Proud of him.”\n\nBeck was at Miami for one year. He made clear after his final college game that whatever the future brings, he'll have the Hurricanes to thank.\n\n“I really couldn’t have done it without all these people around me,” Beck said. “This university truly saved me and helped me rebuild into the man that I am today.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "title": "Williams: Why Marty Brennaman has big interest in national title game",
    "description": "Williams: Luke Brennaman is all in on being a Brennaman. And Marty and Thom are all in on the Indiana University junior's broadcasting aspirations.",
    "fullText": "You have a lot of melodrama in you, Luke. This is a (bleeping) baseball game, not World War III.\n\nYou rose to the occasion, Luke. You were really close to perfection. So happy for you.\n\nJust a sampling of the daily text messages that aspiring play-by-play man Luke Brennaman receives from his baseball hall-of-fame broadcasting grandfather, who even Luke affectionately calls Marty. The texts are equal parts educational, entertaining, critical and complimentary – and 100 percent Marty Brennaman.\n\nLuke Brennaman has gone all in on being a Brennaman. And so Marty and Luke’s dad, broadcaster Thom Brennaman, have gone all in on helping the third member of their family try to reach his goal of becoming a big-league broadcaster someday.\n\nThat journey continues Monday night in Miami, where 20-year-old Luke will call the national championship game between the Indiana Hoosiers and Miami Hurricanes for IU’s student radio station. Luke, a Mariemont High graduate, is a junior in IU's broadcasting program. He is the student radio station's co-sports director and also does work for the student television station.\n\nMarty and Thom will be intently tuned into WIUX-FM 99.1, excited to hear the next step in Luke's journey to potentially making the Brennamans just the second family to have at least three generations of big-league baseball broadcasters. The family of Chicago Cubs legend Harry Caray has had four generations of major-league broadcasters.\n\nThe national championship game will be a broadcasting milestone for the Brennamans. Luke will do what his father once did for Fox back in the BCS days and call a national championship game. No other father and son have broadcast a national college football championship game, Thom believes. Thom, who now calls college games for the CW Network and hosts the morning drive talk show on 700 WLW, called three BCS title games.\n\nLet's go ahead and get this out of the way: Luke isn't counting on the family name to get him to the big leagues. His biggest champions are also his biggest critics, starting with Marty, who also pulls no punches with his grandson.\n\n\"Maybe down the road the last name will make a difference,\" Marty told me in an interview last summer. \"But I told Luke, ‘Don’t think that’s going to allow you to skate into a situation. It boils down to what kind of talent you got.’ \"\n\nMarty continued: \"He has a great passion for being good. He’s very professional. He works at it. He has talent.\"\n\nMarty constantly texts Luke during IU football broadcasts, even calls him at halftime or immediately after the broadcast to give feedback. The \"you rose to the occasion\" text came right after Luke finished calling Indiana's Rose Bowl win against Alabama.\n\n\"You get that text, and it’s like, ‘Wow, this is livin’ right here,’ ” Luke said.\n\nLuke is confident like Marty and Thom. Thom worries about Luke staying humble. Marty's texts help take care of that.\n\nMarty invented brutal honesty in broadcasting during his 46 years calling Cincinnati Reds games on radio, and those texts weren't always so glowing last summer. Luke had landed an unpaid job calling games in the Cape Cod Baseball League, a collegiate wooden-bat summer league. It's not just for college baseball players, but also aspiring broadcasters.\n\nWhen Luke landed the job, which typically goes to college seniors, he realized big-time broadcasting could actually be in his future. Marty and Thom realized it, too, and changed their approach. They've never pushed Luke to pursue broadcasting, but the Cape Cod League job made Marty and Thom have serious conversations with Luke about what it really takes.\n\n\"They were always, 'Do as much as you can, but figure out if you like it,' \" Luke said. \"Early in my sophomore year, I decided I really like this, but wondered when am I going to get good at it? They did such a good job of guiding me and letting me figure it out on my own.\"\n\nLuke added: \"The feedback was always, ‘You did great.’ Then I got the Cape Cod League job. The critique went from 'we're glad you're doing it' to Marty saying: 'What the (bleep) does \"on the bump mean\"? Never say that again.' \"\n\nLuke came home from IU after spring semester for three weeks before heading off to New England to call 44 games in 55 days for the Harwich Mariners. Those three weeks were better than any college course.\n\n\"My dad told me, 'If you’re going to call baseball, you have to know baseball. Do you know how the infield fly works? Well, you better or else you’re going to get eaten alive.’ He said, 'You’re not ready.' He was feeling the magnitude of this. I bought a book called 'The Baseball Thesaurus' and I bought in.\"\n\nLuke and Thom started calling games in the family's Terrace Park living room each night. Luke had to be there at 6 p.m. They'd turn on random games on MLB's television package, mute the TV, call the game radio style and \"annoy the hell out of my mom,\" Luke said. Luke was play-by-play. Thom was color analyst. If the game went to commercial, they'd click to a different game and keep going.\n\n\"I got addicted to it,\" Luke said. \"We'd call four straight innings and get dinner. Then I'd tell my dad, 'Come on, give me three more innings.' \"\n\nThey took the show on the road to Great American Ball Park. Thom, the former long-time TV play-by-play voice of the Reds, arranged with the team to use an empty TV/radio booth for him and Luke to do a practice broadcast. They called two Reds games from the ballpark and recorded them.\n\nLuke learned nuances, such as referring to a pitch count by saying \"2-and-1\" rather than \"2 balls and 1 strike\" – little things to make the broadcast more concise.\n\nLuke believes he wouldn't have made it through the summer without those sessions with dad. Marty and Thom listened to all of Luke's Cape Cod broadcasts. Marty and his wife, Amanda, visited Luke in New England.\n\nOne of Marty's big lessons is not getting overly excited about meaningless plays early in a game. That's where the \"World War III\" text came in, when Marty heard Luke get too excited about an inconsequential walk. Marty was as tough on Luke as he was on some of those Reds players and managers.\n\n\"I called my dad and said, 'If Marty keeps telling me not to say stuff, I may have to go on the air and not speak,' \" Luke said, laughing.\n\nLuke doesn't necessarily look to emulate Marty or Thom on air. He's studied his dad much more than he has Marty. Growing up, it was only natural to watch the Reds on TV in the living room and not listen much on the radio. Luke loves his dad's style, and several times a week goes on YouTube and rewatches clips from Thom's days calling the NFL and college football for Fox and Reds games.\n\nLuke also makes sure to watch his dad call ACC football and basketball games on The CW.\n\n\"I’ve loved my dad’s ability to be a critical of a manager,\" Luke said. \"He’s only able to do that because he knows the game so well. The one thing I’ve taken from both my dad and Marty: I love how they were both so confident in everything they said on the air. That is something my dad ingrained me.\"\n\nContact columnist Jason Williams at jwilliams@enquirer.com\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Marty Brennaman's texts inspire grandson at Indiana University",

    "fullText": "ALFRED, N.Y. (WETM) – The 18 Sports Blitz returned for a special night in high school hoops.\n\nHornell girls basketball highlighted Friday night’s 18 Sports Blitz, with a pair of historic moments at Alfred University. The top-ranked Red Raiders breezed past Haverling 61-24, while improving to (10-1), and celebrating a two historic moments for the program. Midway through the 1st quarter of the contest, Selena Maldonado kicked off the senior night festivities, scoring an “and one,” off of a layup. At the line, Maldonado converted the free throw to earn the 1,000th point of her high school career.\n\nIn the 2nd, fellow senior Jordyn Dyring added to Hornell’s 21-5 lead and etched her name in history. With a floater in the paint, Dyring surpassed 1,527 career points to become the all-time leading scorer for the girl’s program. The impressive record had stood since 1996, when Megan Buchanan wrapped up her high school career with the Red Raiders. Buchanan would follow up her high school success at Division I U Albany.\n\nBuchanan was enshrined in both, the Hornell High School and Albany Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011, following an outstanding career. With the Great Danes, the Arkport native earned Female Athlete of the Year, as a member of the golf and basketball teams. On the court, Buchanan wrapped up her career 3rd in program history with 1,093 points. After her playing career, Buchanan has been serving as Senior Associate Athletic Director at Skidmore College, since 2005.\n\nElsewhere in high school basketball, the Horseheads girls wrapped up the STAC West Division title.

    "fullText": "The team behind Baby Steps discuss why they made a whiny, unprepared manbaby the protagonist – and how players have grown to love Nate as he struggles up a mountain\n\n“I don’t know why he is in a onesie and has a big ass,” shrugs game developer Gabe Cuzzillo. “Bennett just came in with that at some point.”\n\n“I thought it would be cute,” replies Bennett Foddy, who was formerly Cuzzillo’s professor at New York University’s Game Center and is now his collaborator. “Working on character design and animation brings you over to liking big butts. I could give you an enormous amount of evidence for this.”\n\nFoddy and Cuzzillo are talking about Nate, the impressively pathetic manbaby protagonist of their profound and ridiculous comedy game Baby Steps, developed together with Maxi Boch. When I was preparing to talk to them, I felt like I was about to meet my tormentors: I spent a week last year in the grip of this purposefully, transcendentally frustrating game about going on a horrible hiking holiday with the world’s most incompetent loser.\n\nBaby Steps’ premise seems like a cruel joke at first: watch the hapless man suffer! And you will suffer too! But the more I played it, the more meaning I found in it. As the hours passed and I helped Nate overcome his own uselessness and get himself up the mountain, I came around to him.\n\n“People coming around to him is common,” Foddy says. “We’ve had a lot of people say they hated him at the outset – and then they started either identifying with him or identifying him with other people in their lives. Some people end up sexualising him. The commonality between all these things is people coming around in some way, and that is the core philosophy of the game. It should be that it starts out feeling arduous and awkward and annoying and hostile, and then we try to bring you around to find pleasure in it … that happens to Nate in the story as well. He would never go outside for a hike.”\n\nNate is a large, bearded, russet-haired 35-year-old guy with glasses who lives in his parents’ basement. He is socially awkward, a shy urinator, whiny and massively averse to accepting help from anyone. Early in the game you come across another hiker who offers you a map of the mountain; a little mini-map pops up in the corner of the screen for a few seconds before Nate refuses it and it disappears. I guffawed at this. Like most of Baby Steps, it’s a joke about the comfortable, streamlined gaming experiences that we’ve become used to. But it’s also a joke about Nate, and the kind of guy he is.\n\nTalking to Cuzzillo threw me off at first because he is also the voice of Nate; he and Foddy improvised every line in the game. But he also has a deeper connection to the character. “Nate is one manifestation of my personality,” he says. “He’s an aspect of who I am. He’s not a made-up guy. I totally have refuse-the-map guy within me. That’s deep in who I am. If someone tries to help me, I run away screaming. Sometimes that’s a joyful part of who I am, and sometimes it isn’t.”\n\n“In video games you do this too – you immediately put it on the hardest setting and turn off the assists,” attests Foddy.\n\nLike (almost) all game characters, Nate was once a stickman with a block for a head and tissue boxes for feet. Foddy and Cuzzillo ran through nine or 10 prototypes before alighting on the concept for Baby Steps, prototypes that Cuzzillo describes as “very bad”. “We were looking for something with legs,” adds Foddy, straight-faced.\n\nFoddy’s games are full of ostensibly pointless suffering. It’s a theme of his work, alongside the idea of awkwardly moving a character’s body: a previous game of his, Getting Over It, has you trying to fling a guy in a cauldron up a hill with a sledgehammer. This prototype, in which you’d individually control a character’s feet to walk them around, fit that bill: within a couple of days the blockman had become a helicopter pilot, an off-the-shop placeholder asset. It was a couple more years before he became Nate, and six more before the game was finished.\n\n“The idea is that he’s not prepared and he’s out of shape,” says Cuzzillo. “Having an unprepared character gives the player an excuse if they’re feeling like they’re insufficient. They can blame him,” Foddy elaborates. “We had the idea of a cute lumberjacky guy with a little backpack, based on one of our friends, who will never need to know that he was the inspiration.”\n\nAnother of Foddy and Cuzzillo’s friends and colleagues was the source of Baby Steps’ name. They both now teach at NYU’s Game Center, whose chair emeritus Frank Lantz burst into their office with an idea for the name; at that point the main character was a giant baby (you could argue that he still is). Plenty of infantilising imagery remains, from rivers of breast milk to massive sandcastle toys to the gigantic woman who picks Nate up and cradles him in one especially surreal scene.\n\nAs they were playtesting the game with their friends, another aspect of Nate’s personality began to emerge: his misplaced pride. “This slightly obstinate vein of toxic masculine play starts coming out, from seeing some of our friends play it in a certain kind of way,” Foddy says. One of those friends, Julian Cordero (maker of Despelote), started looking very intently off the edge of cliffs after climbing them, inspiring a scene in which Nate’s fellow hiker Mike sits on the edge of a platform contemplating throwing himself all the way down again.\n\nBaby Steps’ interesting exploration of what masculinity means to a guy like Nate is delivered both through the story and the experience of play. You can unlock short, abstract, playable flashbacks to his childhood and the humiliating experiences that have shaped him. There are also somewhat less subtle symbols around, such as the omnipresent phallic imagery. An interesting thing about this game’s meditations on masculinity is that it doesn’t involve women at all: at a time when men’s insecurities are continually being lumped on women and feminism by common-or-garden internet misogynists, this is refreshing. As Foddy says: “Men can have problems with masculinity just by themselves.”\n\nThere is one thing that Nate straightforwardly loves: fruit. Pieces of shiny fruit hang tantalisingly in almost-inaccessible places, tempting you to waste a chunk of your life trying to reach them. If you do, you are treated to a ludicrous close-up of Nate’s face as he noisily consumes it before screaming its name into the wind.\n\n“We needed something to put on top of stuff,” explains Cuzzillo, deadpan. And a selection of increasingly esoteric fruits was the obvious choice? He explains that rewarding the player would be antithetical to the game’s philosophy. “[So] what if it’s a reward for Nate? What if it’s something he loves, so you get to vicariously watch him get a reward? The day we came up with it, we recorded the first five vocal takes … It’s funniest when you’ve tried hardest for it, and what’s at the top is just him having this crazy fruit orgasm.”\n\nThe inspiration for the dumb camera angle – the wide-angle lens from the top of the forehead – was trainspotter Francis Bourgeois. “Something we both got into during Covid, when we were doing initial exploration on this game, is the vein of culture that emerges when people are critically bored,” explains Foddy. “The idea is that these fruit cutscenes are coming when the player is feeling as unhinged as Nate is when he’s enjoying the fruit.”\n\nThat is the joke that Baby Steps keeps coming back to: you might hate Nate, but also if you’re playing a game like this, then in some way you are Nate. After many, many hours on the mountain, out in the snow, you reach an ending when Nate finds a cabin owned by a donkey-man whom he’s sort of befriended on his journey. After a few false starts, he finally knocks on the door and asks to be let in from the cold. You can go for a walk after that concluding scene, but the game goes to great lengths to warn you that there’s no point. There’s nothing else out there.\n\nBaby Steps’ final joke is that it’s lying to you: there is a final cutscene at the top of the mountain. You can go find it if you want, if you’re just irredeemably that kind of person. But for me, the game’s true ending is Nate finally learning to ask for help. I was rather moved by it.\n\nAfter Cuzzillo finished his first commercial game, 2019’s Ape Out, he felt ambivalent about it. “I wasn’t sure whether it was worth it; whether, once I was at the top of the mountain, I really wished I had climbed it,” he says. But he’s feeling much better about Baby Steps in retrospect, and about Nate.\n\n“I understand it way more now after finishing it. I feel like I’m re-realising all the things the game is about… Nate is a microcosm of the whole game, where it’s both a piss-take and sincere at the same time. It’s not one or the other.”",

    "fullText": "Jacksonville University senior guard Priscilla Williams got off to a slow start vs. Central Arkansas on Jan. 15 at Swisher Gym.\n\nShe then turned in an electrifying second half and overtime on her way to the JU single-game scoring record as the Dolphins rallied from a 10-point deficit with 8:36 to play and a five-point deficit with less than 30 seconds left in regulation to beat the Sugar Bears 96-86.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Williams scored 44 points, 36 of them after halftime, breaking Edyn Battle’s record of 39 points against Bellarmine in the ASUN Tournament on March 7, 2025.\n\nIt's also the high individual game in the ASUN this season. JU (11-5, 3-2 in the ASUN) has scored 90 or more points in two of its last three conference games.\n\n“That was hard-fought, a great game,” Dolphins coach Special Jennings said. “Our team figured out a way to win. Great teams figure out how to get it done.”\n\nWilliams made 10 of 20 shots from the floor (four of seven from the 3-point arc) and did her real damage slashing to the basket, drawing foul after foul.\n\nShe made 20 of 22 shots from the foul line to break another pair of school records. Brandi Buie had the previous record in both categories when she made 16 of 19 on Jan. 23, 2017 vs. Lipscomb.\n\nAmazingly, Williams seemed on her way to a subpar night. She made only one of six field goals in the first half and missed her only two 3-point attempts, scoring eight points as the Dolphins trailed 40-36.\n\n“I was really kind of down in the first half, but my coaches calmed me down and told me to keep shooting,” she said. “I never even knew it was a record. My teammates gave me the ball. Shout out to them for letting me play my game.”\n\nJennings called Williams, who also had eight rebounds, three steals and three blocked shots “a unicorn.”\n\n“She knocks down shots, gets to the basket, makes free throws ... defensively she’s long,” Jennings said. “Really proud of that kid.”\n\nWilliams leads the Dolphins with 15.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game.\n\nWilliams scored 12 points in the third quarter, but the Dolphins trailed 61-57, then fell behind 67-57 when UCA’s Jenna Cooke (21 points), opened the fourth period with 3-point shots on back-to-back possessions.\n\nDespite Williams scoring 10 points over the next 4:06, the Sugar Bears’ Shae Littleford (20 points) helped keep UCA ahead. She made three or four foul shots at one point and the Bears led 77-72 with 31.9 seconds remaining.\n\nIt didn't last. Williams drew a foul and made two shots from the line with 18.3 seconds left and after UCA’s Cheyanne Kemp made one foul shot with 10 seconds left to give the Bears a 78-74 lead, Williams hit a 3-pointer to cut it to one.\n\nEmerie Bohanon was fouled intentionally and missed both free throws with five seconds left. After a timeout, the Dolphins rushed the ball up the court and freshman guard Tatum Brown drove the lane and was fouled with 0.07 left on the clock.\n\nBrown could have ended the game by making both free throws. She tied the game with the front end and missed the second.\n\nBut the Dolphins quickly took control in overtime. Junior guard Bailey Burns (12 points, six rebounds off the bench) scored 10 of her points in overtime, with three slicing layups in the first 1:41 of the extra period putting JU ahead for good. Williams got the school record with two foul shots with 1:05 left.\n\n“We needed this,” Williams said of the victory. “I’m really proud of our team.”\n\nBrown had 14 points and 11 rebounds and Makiya Miller added 12 points. The Dolphins overcame 27 turnovers (matching their season-high) and got out-rebounded 44-34.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Florida Times-Union: Priscilla Williams scores a record 44 points to lead JU to overtime victory",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

    "fullText": "An ambitious effort to create a neurophysiological paradigm to explain near-death experiences has failed to capture many fascinating and often perplexing aspects of people’s brushes with death, top University of Virginia experts argue in a new paper.\n\nUVA near-death researchers Bruce Greyson, MD, and Marieta Pehlivanova, PhD, laud the international team of scientists who developed the model, called Neurophysiological Evolutionary Psychological Theory Understanding Near-Death Experience, or NEPTUNE. The NEPTUNE team aimed to bring scientific rigor to understanding near-death experiences (NDEs) – a goal shared by Greyson and Pehlivanova. But the UVA experts say the model, for all its sophistication, leaves far too many unanswered questions to be considered a satisfactory solution to the mysteries of NDEs.\n\n“The NEPTUNE model was a pioneering attempt to explain NDEs, but it selectively ignored scientific evidence that contradicts the model and failed to address some of the most important and defining parts of NDEs,” said Greyson, part of the Division of Perceptual Studies at UVA’s School of Medicine.\n\nIn their new paper, Greyson and Pehlivanova outline many facets of NDEs that the NEPTUNE model – and neurophysiology more broadly – still cannot explain. For example, the NEPTUNE researchers argue that near-death “hallucinations” could be caused by changes in blood brain gases, endorphins or other chemical or electrical activity in the brain.\n\nBut Pehlivanova and Greyson note that neurological hallucinations typically only involve a single sense, such as hearing or sight. Those types of single-sense hallucinations do not align, the UVA researchers say, with the robust and often life-changing encounters near-death experiencers report having with loved ones or even with people they have never met. Experiencers can often recall what they saw, heard, smelled and touched while dead, and the encounters are often burned into their brains for decades – unlike hallucinations, which are quickly forgotten.\n\nThe NEPTUNE group also advanced a potential explanation for the out-of-body experiences near-death experiencers sometimes report. In these instances, experiencers feel disconnected from their physical forms and sometimes recall looking down on their own bodies. The NEPTUNE scientists pointed to two studies suggesting that this may be the result of the activation of a particular region in the brain, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). But Greyson and Pehlivanova counter that the experiences reported in those two studies are “quite unlike” the out-of-body experiences described in NDEs. During TPJ activation, there is a sense of disembodiment, but visual perception remains normal – experiencers don’t see their own forms or feel like they can move about independent of their bodies as near-death experiencers do.\n\nFurther, the UVA researchers note that electrical stimulation studies have already tested the TPJ theory. Stimulating the brain region produced visual hallucinations, but study participants did not believe they had left their bodies, Greyson and Pehlivanova write: “There is no evidence that electrical brain stimulation has ever produced accurate perception of anything not visible to the physical eyes, or that persists when eyes are closed, or that is from an out-of-body perspective – all features observed in spontaneous OBEs.”\n\nWhile Pehlivanova and Greyson raise several additional concerns about the NEPTUNE model, they were eager to applaud its developers for their efforts. “Martial et al have done a monumental job summarizing the major arguments in this field, relying on both theoretical and empirical contributions from the NDE literature and broader major research,” they write. But they say a lack of empirical data and other flaws in the NEPTUNE model raise concerns that “temper our enthusiasm for the model and our confidence that it can provide a comprehensive explanation for NDEs.”\n\nIn other words, neurophysiology still can’t explain near-death experiences, Pehlivanova and Greyson say. But they are eager for the conversation to continue.\n\n“NDEs are typically triggered by physiological events, so it makes sense to explore those connections and look for cause-and-effect. But this effort is just at the beginning stage, and it is important to keep being open-minded as we continue the search,” Greyson said. “Understanding NDEs can unlock the door to larger questions about consciousness and the brain. We hope the quest to appreciate all aspects of NDEs will lead us not just to mapping the triggers of NDEs but also to their meaning and to a better understanding of the boundary between life and death.”\n\nGreyson and Pehlivanova have published their response in the scientific journal Psychology of Consciousness: Theory, Research and Practice. The article is open access, meaning it is free to read.\n\nEstablished in 1967 under the leadership of UVA psychiatrist Ian Stevenson, MD, DOPS stands as the most productive university-based research group in the world dedicated to exploring phenomena that challenge conventional scientific paradigms concerning human consciousness. At the core of DOPS’ research mission lies the commitment to rigorous evaluation of empirical evidence surrounding exceptional human experiences and capacities, including utilization of a state-of-the-art neuroimaging lab. DOPS extends its focus beyond fundamental empirical research and explores the profound implications of such research for scientific theory and society at large. By actively sharing insights and findings, DOPS strives to contribute meaningfully to the understanding of consciousness, bridging the gap between scientific inquiry and public awareness.\n\nArticle written by Josh Barney, Deputy Public Information Officer, UVA Health.",

    "fullText": "WACO, Texas (AP) — Iowa State point guard Tamin Lipsey, the senior who grew up near campus in Ames, is now part of something that had never been done by the Cyclones. They have a 15-game winning streak to start the season.\n\n“I’ve been a Cyclone all my life. Just got on the court four years ago, though,” Lipsey said Wednesday night following a 70-60 victory at Baylor. “Watching all those teams growing up and just realizing that I have a chance right now to make a footprint for Iowa State, and just the community of Ames and all of that, I never take for granted.”\n\nLipsey scored 24 points, overcoming some early foul trouble that kept him on the bench for nearly eight minutes in the first half. Joshua Jefferson had 19 points and 17 rebounds for Iowa State (15-0, 2-0 Big 12).\n\nThe Cyclones' 15-0 start and 15-game winning streak are both school records, surpassing a 14-0 start by the 2013-14 team that reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. They are one of six undefeated Division I teams, along with No. 1 Arizona, No. 2 Michigan, No. 10 Nebraska, No. 11 Vanderbilt and unranked Miami, Ohio.\n\n“I think these guys do such a great job at honoring all those who have come before us with the effort and the execution that they play with,” fifth-year Cyclones coach T.J. Otzelberger said. “So it’s a great accomplishment. It’s a credit to the young men and how they work. And hopefully something that the past Cyclones who have been in this program and those that have invested can take tremendous pride in.”\n\nJefferson, a senior forward and second-year transfer from Saint Mary's, already had his sixth double-double of the season by halftime.\n\nHis long-3-pointer with 5 seconds left in the first half gave the Cyclones their first lead at 25-24. They never gave that up, starting the second half with a 14-1 run when six players scored and Jefferson capped it with a fast-break dunk.\n\n“A huge shot Joshua made just before the half,\" Otzelberger said. “A huge momentum play that carried into that second half.”\n\nLipsey has started all 115 of his games in four seasons with the Cyclones, including three NCAA Tournament appearances and a Sweet 16 in that time. He came out after his second foul with 17:12 left in the first half and didn't return until the 9:19 mark. He finally scored with 6:11 left in the first half, then had 20 points after halftime.\n\n\"I'd take him over any point guard in America,\" Otzelberger said. “Obviously, not having Tamin out there quite as much in the first half impacted where the game was at. But man, in that second half, the plays he made, the shots he made, it was amazing — especially when you have to bounce back when your normal routine and rhythm of a game is disrupted because of the fouls.”\n\nAfter the Cyclones shot 27.8% from the field (10 of 36) in the first half, they were at 57.1% (16 of 28) after halftime.\n\nOn the defensive side, they held Baylor to 18.8% (6 of 32) before halftime and 30.6% (19 of 62) overall.\n\n“Iowa State is a really good team. If you ask me, right now, today, them and Michigan are the two best in college basketball,” Baylor coach Scott Drew said. “They’re not going to beat themselves. They know exactly where they’re going to be, how they’re going to do things. T.J. has done a great job with them.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "The Wasatch Mountain Range of the Greater Rockies will serve as the backdrop for the 2027 NHL Winter Classic. University of Utah's Rice-Eccles Stadium will be the site of the league's signature regular-season event, which the Utah Mammoth will host in the franchise's third season.\n\nThe Mammoth will welcome the Colorado Avalanche in a college football venue that seats approximately 51,400 on a fall Saturday in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe date of the game has yet to be finalized, but NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Mammoth owners Ryan and Ashley Smith revealed the matchup Wednesday, along with Mammoth center Logan Cooley.\n\nLogan Cooley on getting to play in the 2027 Winter Classic at Rice-Eccles Stadium: pic.twitter.com/SduTSBg5ah\n\n— Jenna Fink (@jennamfink) January 7, 2026\n\nThe Mammoth, who formed after the Arizona Coyotes were dissolved in April 2024, are currently in their second season.\n\nAfter an 8-2 start to the season, they're now 20-20-3 and in fourth place of the Central Division with 43 points.\n\nThis season, the Mammoth still have one more head-to-head meeting versus the Avalanche, who are the division leaders with a 31-4-7 record. Colorado is also atop the Western Conference at the moment with 69 points.\n\nThe Mammoth and Avalanche have met six times over the past two seasons, with Colorado holding a five-point advantage over Utah in the series. Their lone remaining matchup during the 2025-26 season is on Feb. 25 in Utah.\n\nNext season's Winter Classic will mark the Avalanche's fourth appearance in an outdoor game. Utah, on the other hand, will soon become the 32nd NHL franchise to play in an outdoor game.\n\nThe Classic started as an annual tradition on Jan. 1, 2008. At the time, the Buffalo Sabres played the Pittsburgh Penguins at what was then known as Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, home of the NFL's Buffalo Bills.\n\nThis year's Winter Classic was held Jan. 2 at the Miami Marlins' loanDepot Park. The New York Rangers defeated the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers 5-1.\n\nIt was the fifth straight Classic at a baseball stadium.\n\nThat streak will end next season in Salt Lake City, where the University of Utah's campus will take center stage, as Rice-Eccles becomes the fourth college football stadium to host the event.\n\nNotably, Rice-Eccles also put on the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics. It's scheduled to fulfill the same role when the Games return to Utah in 2034.",

    "fullText": "Ben Parris is a professor of cognition and cognitive neuroscience in Bournemouth University’s School of Psychology. He is also co-founder of the university’s Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Research Centre\n\nA decline in your cognitive health is something that can creep up on you. It’s not like a bad back or dodgy knee, which will give you plenty of gyp as soon as there is a problem. You may suddenly find that you’re not quite as mentally sharp as you once were.\n\nYou may notice that it becomes harder to hold conversations, remember phone numbers and do everyday tasks such as go to the shops. That’s a result of your frontal lobe beginning to waste away, which happens to all of us as we age, though at different rates.\n\nThis part of the brain is located just behind our forehead and is home to our executive functions – our ability to plan, organise, focus and generally interact with the world around us. It’s different from dementia, though that disease speeds up the process.\n\nWhile the frontal lobe does eventually deteriorate, as a professor and researcher who studies cognitive decline, I have seen it remain in good nick in people in their 60s and beyond.\n\nThe key to keeping your mental abilities sharp as you age starts with noticing when the frontal lobe is shrinking. If you’re aware, there are things you can do to slow it down. So here are the signs it’s happening to you, and what you can do about it. I’ve also compiled a series of tests so that you can test how well your brain is ageing, which you can access below.\n\nOne of the first signs of a decline in your cognitive health can be struggling to switch between tasks, such as cooking a meal while also holding a conversation with someone.\n\nYou might notice that you struggle to respond to someone’s comment, as you’re still thinking about what to do next in your recipe.\n\nThere is a loosening of the sharpness that was once there. The tasks bleed together, you’re not able to focus and it takes you a bit of time to adjust.\n\nThis signals a problem with your cognitive flexibility, which is the ability to switch between different tasks and remain focused. This represents one of the more difficult tasks that we engage in on a daily basis, so it can be the first ability that you notice is deteriorating.\n\nIn extreme cases, people can be stirring a pot and as they turn around to talk to someone, they are still doing the action of stirring but without the spoon in their hand.\n\nWe can all jumble up words at times, especially if we’re tired or distracted. However, if you catch yourself regularly skipping over words, it could be a sign of cognitive decline.\n\nFor example, instead of saying “I’m just going to pop to the shops”, you might come out with “I’m just shops”.\n\nIt can be a sign that there is a problem with your response inhibition, which is a cognitive function located in your frontal lobe. It is a skill we need for focus and to block out irrelevant information.\n\nWhen you skip words like this, it means that your brain failed to inhibit (or block out) the last word in the sentence until it was time to say it. It’s a form of language breakdown that can be an early sign of dementia.\n\nRegularly mixing up related words is another sign that your cognition isn’t in peak condition.\n\nFor example, if you want to say the word “fork”, it should be at the forefront of your mind but, when there is a problem with response inhibition, related words such as “spoon” and “knife” can also float to the surface.\n\nIf this part of our cognitive function continues to deteriorate, you may say words that become increasingly distant from the word you meant to say, for example “plate” or even “train” instead of “fork”. This is a sign that there is misfiring going on in the brain.\n\nThe frequency with which this occurs and the distance from the word you intended to say can be used to determine the severity of cognitive decline.\n\nIf you realise that you need to nip to the shop for some milk, your brain quickly comes up with a plan. Where is the nearest shop? How will you get there? Do you have a way of paying?\n\nWith good cognitive health, this requires little effort and you may not give these questions a second thought. However, if one of these components goes wrong – for example, you forget a means of payment – it signals a failure in working memory, which is our ability to maintain and manipulate information.\n\nAs you were leaving the house, you failed to maintain one of the key components of the task. Such mental slips become more common as we age and our frontal lobes atrophy.\n\nIf this happens occasionally and is not increasing in frequency, it’s nothing to worry about. I have been known to drive to the supermarket and walk home, forgetting that I’ve left the car as I’ve been busy thinking about other things.\n\nHowever, if it happens more and more often, you might want to consider seeing your GP. It could be an early sign of dementia.\n\nForgetting what you need from the shop, and struggling to find the items you want to buy, are signs of cognitive decline.\n\nYou rely on your short-term memory to remember what you need from the shop and your spatial memory (the ability to understand where you are in relation to your surroundings) to be able to find the products you need.\n\nIf this part of your cognitive health is deteriorating, you may find yourself walking up and down the same aisles many times, as you’ve forgotten which you’ve already been down.\n\nOne famous study took patients to a shopping centre and gave them a list of items to buy, such as milk and a newspaper. Those suffering from cognitive decline walked up and down multiple times, getting the items in an illogical way, following an incoherent path.\n\nIf you are experiencing any of these symptoms and it is significantly affecting your ability to continue with life as normal, or you have noticed that they are getting worse, I would recommend going to your GP.\n\nIt’s also worth booking an appointment with your doctor if a loved one is concerned about your cognitive health, even if you are not, as you could be experiencing anosognosia, which is a lack of awareness of your own cognitive decline. This is a common problem.\n\nWhile these symptoms could be a sign of cognitive decline or dementia, they could also be caused by a stroke or tumour. The earlier you see your GP, the easier it is to treat.\n\nIf concerned, your doctor should refer you to the neuropsychology clinic at your local hospital. There, you will probably complete a series of memory tests, such as the “Stroop task” and the Corsi block-tapping test, and have an MRI to look for shrinkage in the frontal lobe, which would indicate dementia, or lesions, which may be evidence of a stroke.\n\nThere are no hidden secrets in terms of maintaining cognitive health. As far as we’re aware, it’s the same recommendations as for maintaining bodily health.\n\nDiet and exercise are the two most important pillars to focus on for your brain.\n\nFollowing a healthy diet – which includes plenty of green leafy vegetables, fish, nuts and berries – has been shown to slow cognitive decline, which is thought to be because these foods contain nutrients such as folate and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nWeight-training twice a week has been linked to less brain shrinkage and better performance on memory tests, while cardio improves blood flow, including to the brain, promoting the development of new brain cells and protecting the organ against inflammation.\n\nI always recommend cutting back on alcohol – and only drink a few times a year myself – as research has shown that it causes shrinkage in parts of the brain important for memory, and poorer performance on cognitive tests. I’d also recommend quitting drinking alcohol alone, as the only benefits thought to come from drinking is if it gets you out socialising.\n\nIt’s possible that the deterioration of our frontal lobe happens, or is sped up, due to a lack of use, and challenging your brain has been linked with delaying cognitive decline. This could mean learning a new instrument or language, reading difficult books, doing calculations in your head instead of on your phone calculator, completing puzzles, and even watching quiz shows. They can all play a role in keeping your brain younger.\n\nSpending time in nature has been linked to better working memory, while holding conversations, and socialising has been shown to keep our cognitive health better for longer. Whether it’s having a conversation or making plans to meet loved ones, you’re working those cognitive muscles.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "A new study has bolstered a scathing dissent from liberal Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that warned the court appeared to favor the rich.\n\nThe study, published Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research, investigated whether the Supreme Court has contributed to rising income inequality by ruling in favor of policies that favor wealthy parties.\n\nIts authors—two academics from Columbia University in New York and one from Yale University—found that in cases pitting the rich against the poor, Republican appointees were far more likely than their Democratic colleagues to side with the wealthier party.\n\nBack in 1953, Democratic and Republican appointees were statistically indistinguishable on the issue, with justices appointed by members of both parties favoring the rich in 45 percent of cases on average.\n\nThe average Democratic justice cast a “pro-rich” vote—which was defined as a vote that would directly shift resources to the party that was more likely to be wealthy, including votes that supported businesses over consumers or workers—just 35 percent of the time.\n\n“The results reveal a steady increase in polarization, mostly due to Republican appointees whose decisions rise from about 50 percent pro-rich share to a 70 percent pro-rich share over the course of 70 years,” the study’s authors, Andrea Prat, a Columbia economics professor, Jacob Spitz, a Columbia PhD student, Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, and wrote.\n\nThe findings also supported a June dissent authored by Brown Jackson, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe justices held 7-2 that oil and gas companies had legal standing to challenge California’s environmental regulations requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered ones.\n\n“This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens,” Brown Jackson wrote. “I worry that the fuel industry’s gain comes at a reputational cost for this Court, which is already viewed by many as being overly sympathetic to corporate interests.”\n\nThat perception could be contributing to an overall drop in public confidence in the court, according to the Times. The Daily Beast has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.\n\nThe court’s favorability rating has plunged by 22 points over the past five years, from 70 percent in 2020 to a near-record low 48 percent late last year, the Pew Research Center reported in September.\n\nAnd although a vast majority of Americans, or 86 percent, think the justices should be non-partisan, 56 percent said the justices were doing only a fair or poor job of keeping their political views out of their legal decision-making.",

    "fullText": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (USF) — The University of Sioux Falls men’s basketball team kept their momentum rolling on Monday afternoon, grinding out an 81–75 victory over Briar Cliff inside the Stewart Center. The win pushed the Cougars’ winning streak to four games in a physical, paint-dominated battle that required clutch execution and second-half composure to put away a scrappy Charger squad.\n\nThis was a blue-collar victory through and through. Both teams traded blows in a back-and-forth contest that stayed tight for the better part of 40 minutes. Sioux Falls shot an efficient 50 percent from the field (32-of-64), methodically attacking the rim and imposing their will in the paint while Briar Cliff refused to go away quietly.\n\nFour Cougars reached double figures, led by Brogan Madson’s team-high 21 points, as USF found ways to score even when the perimeter game went cold. The difference came after halftime, where Sioux Falls outscored the Chargers 43–37 behind relentless interior scoring and timely free-throw shooting that ultimately sealed the deal.\n\nTaylen Ashley and Madson combined for 21 second-half points, while Brandon Hrncir delivered a perfect shooting performance after the break. When the dust settled, it was the Cougars’ dominance on the glass and their poise in crunch time that made the difference in the six-point win.\n\nBriar Cliff came out sharp, connecting on 15-of-31 from the floor while Sioux Falls answered with a 15-of-33 effort. Neither team found a rhythm from deep—USF managed just 2-of-10 from three while the Chargers hit 4-of-13. The Cougars established their identity early, however, bullying Briar Cliff inside for a 24–16 paint advantage.\n\nThe first 20 minutes featured five lead changes and four ties as neither squad could create separation. Ball security was excellent on both sides with just two turnovers apiece, and the rebounding battle stayed competitive with USF holding a narrow 20–17 edge. The teams headed to the locker room deadlocked after a tightly contested opening half.\n\nSioux Falls took control after intermission, outscoring Briar Cliff 43–37 to close out the victory. The paint remained the Cougars’ domain, where they pounded out a 28–16 scoring advantage in the half. Ashley sparked the offense with 11 second-half points while Madson added 10 more, consistently attacking a tiring Charger defense.\n\nHrncir was surgical in the second half—a flawless 4-for-4 from the field for nine points while pulling down five rebounds. The Cougars crashed the offensive glass for seven second-half boards, creating extra possessions at critical moments. When the game was on the line, Madson calmly sank all of his free throws to ice the win.\n\n“It was good to keep our winning streak going. We didn’t play our best basketball, but give Briar Cliff a lot of credit for that. We found a way, and now we need to get back to practice and get ready for road games at Duluth and Bemidji.”\n— Head Coach Chris Johnson\n\nBrogan Madson – 21 points (8-of-14 FG), 3 assists\n\nTaylen Ashley – 19 points, 4 rebounds\n\nBrandon Hrncir – 19 points (8-of-11 FG), 9 rebounds, 3 assists\n\nKyle Ingwerson – 10 points, 7 rebounds\n\nPaint: Sioux Falls owned a 52–32 advantage in points in the paint.\n\nRebounding: The Cougars outrebounded Briar Cliff 42–28, including 10 offensive rebounds.\n\nShooting: USF finished at 50.0 percent from the field while holding Briar Cliff to fewer second-half opportunities inside.\n\nBalance: Four Cougars scored in double figures, providing consistent offense throughout the lineup.\n\nFree Throws: Sioux Falls went 12-of-17 at the line, converting key attempts late.\n\nThe Cougars hit the road next weekend, traveling to face Minnesota Duluth on January 9 and Bemidji State on January 10.",

Until recently, only public universities offering state-recognized degrees have operated in Greece. But recognized private universities are gradually being introduced.\n\nEducation Ministry officials said that dormant students — those who had interrupted their studies — didn't impose any direct financial burden on universities, but created administrative difficulties.\n\n“With updated student lists, universities gain the ability to plan more precisely,” Deputy Education Minister Nikos Papaioannou said.\n\n“That is a prerequisite for improving academic quality, daily operations and the criteria used to evaluate Greek universities in international rankings.”",

    "fullText": "POPOCATÉPETL VOLCANO, Mexico (AP) — In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocatépetl volcano, one of the world’s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.\n\nFor five years, the group from Mexico’s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the whole 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano’s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.\n\nMarco Calò, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute’s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.\n\nInside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.\n\nMost of the world’s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocatépetl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.\n\nOther scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see “how the volcanic edifice was being built,” and above all, where the magma gathered, Calò said.\n\nHis team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.\n\nThe devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.\n\n“I taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo” and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.\n\nLittle by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.\n\nThe result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.\n\nThis first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.\n\nPopocatépetl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.\n\nCalò, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.\n\nHe explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocatépetl, in the first century, had its own “little Pompeii” when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions — using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater — that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.\n\nFor years Calò studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to “understand how something works without touching it” spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.\n\nThat changed with Popocatépetl, a volcano he describes as “majestic.”\n\nAfter hours of walking up the volcano’s flank, Calò’s team sets up camp in a pine grove at about 12,500 feet of elevation, an apparent safe spot from pyroclastic explosions, since the trees have managed to grow to significant height.\n\nA short distance higher on the mountain, the trees and scrub give way to ash and sediment.\n\nThey must cross a lahar, a mixture of rock and ash that during the rainy season becomes a dangerous mudflow carrying away everything in its path. Now, the dry clearing provides a spectacular view: to the east the Pico de Orizaba — Mexico’s tallest volcano and mountain and the dormant volcano La Malinche; to the north, Iztaccíhuatl, an inactive volcanic peak known as “the sleeping woman.”\n\nPopocatépetl’s sounds seem to multiply at night with the echoes. An explosion like a rocket might sound like it’s coming from one direction, but a puff of smoke from the crater belies the real source.\n\nKarina Rodríguez, a 26-year-old master’s student on the team, said you can also hear small tremors in the earth or even ash falling like rain when the volcano is more active. On dark nights, the rim of the crater glows orange.\n\nHaving direct knowledge of the volcano provides a much more objective sense of the limits of their analysis, Calò said.\n\n“We have a natural laboratory here,” he said. It’s “very important to be able to understand and give residents detailed, trustworthy information about what is happening inside the volcano.”\n\nAt 13,780 feet (4,200 meters), their backpacks full of computers, equipment to analyze gases, batteries and water begin to weigh more and their pace slows.\n\nAsh, dark and warm, dominates the landscape here.\n\nAt a seismographic station, the team digs up the equipment and celebrates that it’s still working. They download its data and rebury it.\n\nA “volcanic bomb,” a rock a yard and a half in diameter and weighing tons, marks the way and gives an idea of what the start of an eruption can mean. That is why the top area of the volcano is restricted, though not everyone pays heed. In 2022, a person died after being hit by a rock about 300 yards (meters) from the crater.\n\nA bottle of tequila near a rocky hollow, known as El Popo’s belly button, hints at some of the traditions surrounding the volcano, including an annual pilgrimage to what some consider a point of connection to the underworld.\n\nDigging up one of the last seismic stations, Calò’s face falls. The last registered data are from months earlier. The battery died. Sometimes rats chew the machines’ wires or an explosion causes more serious damage.\n\nThe project has yielded some certainties and if repeated will allow the analysis of changes that eventually will help authorities make better decisions when eruptions occur.\n\nBut Calò says that, as always happens with science, it has also generated new questions that they will have to try to address, like why the tremors are more frequent on the southeast side — where there is more accumulated magma — and what implications that could have.\n\nThis was the last expedition before their years of work to map the volcano’s interior is published. Watching the volcano’s interior move in 3D on a computer screen makes all of the effort worthwhile.\n\n“It’s what drives you to start another project and keep climbing,” Rodríguez, the master's student, said.",

    "fullText": "BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia's protesting university students on Sunday collected signatures throughout the country for their request for an early parliamentary election that they hope would oust the autocratic government of President Aleksandar Vucic from office.\n\nBraving freezing weather, the students set up nearly 500 stands in dozens of cities, towns and villages in the Balkan country for residents to sign the election demand, which isn't a formal petition. Students have said that Sunday’s action was meant to put further pressure on Vucic and as a test of support.\n\nYoung protesters have been at the forefront of a nationwide movement against Vucic's populist rule in Serbia. More than a year of street protests first started in November 2024 after a train station disaster that killed 16 people.\n\nThe concrete canopy collapse in the northern city of Novi Sad was widely blamed on alleged rampant corruption and disregard of construction and safety rules during renovation work at the station. No one has been held responsible for the tragedy.\n\nVucic has refused to schedule an immediate early vote, but has suggested that it could be held sometime next year. Both parliamentary and presidential elections are otherwise due in 2027.\n\n“We have stands that serve to connect with the citizens,\" said Igor Dojnov, a student manning one of the points in central Belgrade.\n\nYouth-led protests during the past year have shaken Vucic more than ever during his 13-year-long tenure. Serbia's populist prime minister resigned in January, and Vucic later launched a crackdown on protesters that also drew international criticism.\n\nWhile street protests have subsided, discontent with Vucic's government is believed to be widespread.\n\nMilca Cankovic Kadijevic, a resident of Belgrade, said that she supported the students, because “I have a desire to live decently — me, my children and my grandchildren.\"\n\nVucic has formally promised to take Serbia into the European Union, but he has maintained close links with Russia and China, while facing accusations of clamping down on democratic freedoms and allowing corruption and organized crime to flourish.\n\nHe has denied this, and accused the protesters of attempting to orchestrate a “color revolution” under unspecified orders from the West. The term “color revolution” has been used to describe a series of mass protests at the beginning of the 21st century that sometimes led to the toppling of governments in the former Soviet Union states, the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Asia.",

    "fullText": "Scientists from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and the University of Michigan have created the world's smallest autonomous and programmable robots. Each measuring about 200 micrometers wide – roughly twice the width of a human hair – these machines can perceive their surroundings, \"think,\" and act independently without external instructions. According to their developers, such technology could one day monitor the health of individual cells in our bodies or deliver medication to specific locations to treat diseases.\n\nThe researchers' major breakthrough was enabling a robot just one-fifth of a millimeter long to move autonomously without external assistance, a challenge scientists have been trying to solve for decades. Physical forces such as drag and viscosity have a much stronger effect on objects at the microscopic scale, making movement through a liquid comparable to swimming through tar at the human scale.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, the Penn team designed a new propulsion system. The microrobots are powered by LED light and operate in a hydrogen peroxide solution, which provides the fuel for their movement. The robot generates an electric field that propels the ions in the surrounding solution, which in turn drag water molecules along. The microrobots can adjust this electric field to move in complex patterns and even travel in coordinated groups at speeds of up to one body length per second.\n\nThe world's smallest autonomous robot requires the world's smallest computer. That title belongs to a computer developed by David Blaauw's team at Michigan. The researchers adapted their microcomputer to Penn's propulsion system and built a complete computer with a processor, memory, and sensors on a chip less than a millimeter across.\n\nThe robot receives light through microscopic solar panels that generate only 75 nanowatts of power – over 100,000 times less than a smartwatch, according to Blaauw. His team had to make the microcomputer circuits operate at extremely low voltages, reducing power consumption by more than a factor of 1,000.\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature is the overall system cost. Although each robot costs about one cent to produce at scale, one might assume that the equipment needed to program and control them would be prohibitively expensive. That is not the case.\n\n\"It’s about $100,\" Marc Miskin, a professor at Penn Engineering and lead author of the study, told me by email. The team has already built a low-cost version of their setup using standard LED diodes, a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, and an imaging system consisting of a smartphone camera fitted with a macro lens. \"This system actually performs about as well as our fancy $100k microscope. Because the robot is doing all the hard work, it doesn't need you to tell it what to do,\" Miskin explained.\n\nThe microrobots feature electronic sensors capable of detecting temperature with a precision of one-third of a degree Celsius, allowing them to monitor the health of individual cells. However, several obstacles remain before this technology can be applied to human health.\n\nJust like the cells in our bodies, which require a constant energy supply to survive, the microrobots cannot function without continuous light. \"If you turn off the light, the robot turns off and the memory gets cleared,\" Miskin said. \"Turn the light back on, and it will reboot, but won't remember what you programmed it to do. This is a common feature of sub-mm systems, because the total energy you can store (e.g. a battery) scales with its volume, it's extremely hard to store any useful amount in a small space.\"\n\nBut there’s another challenge, in their current version, the robots operate in a 5-millimolar hydrogen peroxide solution, which is toxic to living cells. This makes them unsuitable for medical applications in their present form. The researchers acknowledge this limitation, but it is not insurmountable. Because the robot is electronically integrated, actuators can be swapped freely, you only need to match the operating voltage and required current. \"We're actively working on building the corresponding robots, integrating these bio-compatible actuators with circuits, and you'll hopefully see some of these soon,\" Miskin explained.\n\nMiskin is even more excited about something else: using these robots to assemble microscale components. \"Almost everything we build at the microscale these days is made all at once, monolithically,\" he said. \"For example, when we build circuits, we make them out of these complex patterns on big wafers. If you want to change one part of that circuit, you have to rebuild the whole thing.\"\n\nThe researchers argue this could lower costs, speed up design iterations, and even simplify intellectual property. \"The microscale is an amazing place,\" Miskin noted. \"Having little agents that humans can program and control could open up all kinds of remarkable doors. I'm cautiously optimistic the best applications have yet to be imagined.\"",

    "fullText": "The demolition of Hawai’i’s Aloha Stadium is finally underway after several delays.\n\nOnce home to the NFL Pro Bowl, college football’s Hawaiʻi Bowl and University of Hawaiʻi football, Aloha Stadium is transitioning into a new scaled-down stadium with an accompanying entertainment district.\n\nAs part of the New Aloha Stadium Entertainment District (NASED) project, the new stadium is set for a projected grand opening in March 2029, and is expected to have a seating capacity of 22,500, less than half of the previous 50,000 seats it held.\n\n“The demolition/dismantling of Aloha Stadium has begun,” Aloha Stadium Authority chairman Eric Fujimoto said at the NASED monthly meeting on Dec. 18. The removal of furnishings and the subsequent dismantling of the facility are expected to take approximately 10 months.\n\nThe beginning of the demolition process marks a major milestone for a plan that has been repeatedly delayed. The reopening of the stadium was initially scheduled to be on time for the Rainbow Warriors’ football season in 2028, but was pushed back to 2029 in August of this year.\n\nBefore its final closing after years of maintenance issues, Aloha Stadium was an innovative steel-constructed venue with movable seating sections for different sports and events.\n\nHowever, the stadium, also known as the Metal Mecca, met its downfall because of that very design structure.\n\nThe steel structure was not a good match for Hawai’i’s humid climate, which led to severe, damaging rust that required frequent repairs.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the stadium with a costly history was put to rest.\n\nWith the demolition now in full swing, attention turns to the broader vision of the NASED project. The construction of the new, smaller stadium and the surrounding entertainment district is expected to cost the state $350 million.\n\nThe new Aloha Stadium’s entertainment district is expected to include 4,000 to 4,500 housing units, multiple hotels, retail and dining spaces and cultural attractions. Residential construction is projected to take place shortly after the opening of the newly renovated Aloha Stadium, as early as 2029 or 2030.\n\nDiego Rivera - The Sporting Tribune\n\nThe University of Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors celebrate linebacker Jalen Smith's (3) fumble recovery during an NCAA football game against the Utah State Aggies, Saturday, October 11, 2025.\n\nAfter playing its home games at the Clarence T.C. Ching Athletics Complex since the closing of Aloha Stadium, University of Hawai’i football is set to move back into the new facility in 2029 under a license agreement negotiated with Hawai’i Athletics Director Matt Elliott.\n\n“While there is still much work ahead, the progress being made gives all of us reason to be optimistic,” Elliott said in a September press release. “We are excited to see momentum building and remain committed to doing our part to bring this long-awaited vision to life.”\n\nAs demolition progresses and construction plans take shape, the NASED project ushers in a new era for Hawai’i sports.",

    "description": "I thought I would enjoy attending a private university in Milan. I quickly learned I had made the wrong choice.",
    "fullText": "I crossed the street near where I was living in Milan on the verge of tears. I had had enough of feeling sad, lonely, and hopeless.\n\nThat surely wasn't how I expected to feel in my first year of university.\n\nThe previous spring, I had thought about which undergraduate degree I wanted to pursue for months, reading about courses, tuition, and life in a new place. Since I loved writing and dreamed of becoming a journalist, studying communication seemed like the best bet. I chose to pursue a degree at a private university in Milan because the classes seemed fascinating and useful, and the idea of living in Milan was thrilling.\n\nUnfortunately, I soon realized I had made the wrong choice.\n\nThe majority of the courses I was taking were engaging, but we occasionally experienced last-minute schedule changes and disorganized lecturers, and that didn't sit right with me.\n\nMore importantly, I began to feel guilty about the expenses my parents were covering for me. They assured me they could afford it and that my education was worthwhile to them; nonetheless, the tuition and rent were expensive. And, if I wasn't loving it, should they be spending so much?\n\nLiving in Milan was way more exciting in my dreams than it was in reality. While this metropolis had a lot to offer, like cultural exhibitions, sports events, and a lively nightlife, it was also chaotic and hectic. I often felt agitated and restless.\n\nIn my first months there, my sleep was severely affected. It was extremely challenging to find accommodation near the university, and I ended up in a small apartment with a shared bedroom. I struggled to adapt to that living situation and to the noisy neighborhood we lived in.\n\nThe following summer, I applied to the University of Urbino. The living costs and slower rhythms of Urbino, a 15,000-inhabitant town located a short distance from where I grew up in San Marino, were way more appealing to me.\n\nThere, I could attend classes just three days a week, so finding an accommodation wasn't an urgent matter anymore. It was manageable to go back and forth by car from my family home in the first month.\n\nAfter that period, I rented a single room with a stunning view, at a walkable distance from my lecture halls. The morning walk in Urbino's historical center to class became a pleasurable part of my day.\n\nI felt relieved because the public university tuition and accommodation in Urbino were much cheaper than what I was paying in Milan. Given the flexibility of my new arrangement and the saved money, I signed up for a fitness course with training branches in Urbino and San Marino, as well as a mindfulness program in Rimini. I was brighter and more serene.\n\nUnfortunately, this period in Urbino didn't last long, because COVID-19 hit and universities implemented online lessons, and I eventually ended up moving back home.\n\nLooking back, those few months in Urbino were the best period of my early 20s, and I'm glad I was courageous enough to know that something wasn't right and that I could do something about it, and that's a lesson that still sticks with me today.",

    "title": "Study Shows Alzheimer's Disease Can Be Reversed in Animal Models",
    "description": "Researchers from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland VA showed restoring the brain’s energy balance led to both pathological and functional recovery.",
    "fullText": "Dr. Andrew Pieper, senior author of the study.\n\nCLEVELAND – For over a century, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been considered irreversible. Consequently, research has focused on disease prevention or slowing, rather than recovery. Despite billions of dollars spent on decades of research, there has never been a clinical trial of a drug for AD with an outcome goal of reversing disease and recovering function.\n\nNow, a research team from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center has challenged this long-held dogma in the field. They tested whether brains already badly afflicted with advanced AD could recover.\n\nThe study, led by Kalyani Chaubey, PhD, from the Pieper Laboratory, published today in Cell Reports Medicine. Through studying diverse preclinical mouse models and human AD brains, the team showed that the brain’s failure to maintain normal levels of a central cellular energy molecule, NAD+, is a major driver of AD, and that maintaining proper NAD+ balance can prevent and even reverse the disease.\n\nNAD+ levels decline naturally across the body, including the brain, as people age. Without proper NAD+ balance, cells eventually become unable to execute critical processes required for proper functioning and survival. In this study, the team showed that the decline in NAD+ is even more severe in the brains of people with AD, and that this also occurs in mouse models of the disease.\n\nWhile AD is a uniquely human condition, it can be studied in the laboratory with mice that have been engineered to express genetic mutations that cause AD in people. The researchers used two of these models. One line of mice carried multiple human mutations in amyloid processing, and the other mouse line carried a human mutation in the tau protein. Amyloid and tau pathology are two of the major early events in AD, and both lines of mice develop brain pathology resembling AD, including blood-brain barrier deterioration, axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, reduced synaptic transmission, and widespread accumulation of oxidative damage. These mice also develop severe cognitive impairments that resemble what is seen in people with AD.\n\nAfter finding that NAD+ levels in the brain declined precipitously in both human and mouse AD, the research team tested whether preventing the loss of brain NAD+ balance before disease onset, or restoring brain NAD+ balance after significant disease progression, could prevent or reverse AD, respectively. The study was based on their previous work, published in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA, showing that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance achieved pathological and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury. They restored NAD+ balance by administering a now well-characterized pharmacologic agent known as P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper lab.\n\nRemarkably, not only did preserving NAD+ balance protect mice from developing AD, but delayed treatment in mice with advanced disease also enabled the brain to fix the major pathological events caused by the genetic mutations. Moreover, both lines of mice fully recovered cognitive function. This was accompanied by normalized blood levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker of AD in people, providing confirmation of disease reversal and highlighting a potential biomarker for future clinical trials.\n\n“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH. “Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain’s NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer’s.”\n\nDr. Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. He serves as Psychiatrist and Investigator in the Louis Stokes VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC).\n\nThe results prompt a paradigm shift in how researchers, clinicians, and patients can think about treating AD in the future. “The key takeaway is a message of hope – the effects of Alzheimer's disease may not be inevitably permanent,” said Dr. Pieper. “The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.”\n\nDr. Chaubey further explained, “Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD.”\n\nDr. Pieper emphasized that currently available over the counter NAD+-precursors have been shown in animal models to raise cellular NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer The approach in this study, however, uses a pharmacologic agent (P7C3-A20) that enables cells to maintain their proper balance of NAD+ under conditions of otherwise overwhelming stress, without elevating NAD+ to supraphysiologic levels.\n\n“This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,” said Dr. Pieper.\n\nThis work also encourages new research into complementary approaches and eventual testing in patients, and the technology is being commercialized by Cleveland-based company Glengary Brain Health, co-founded by Dr. Pieper.\n\n“This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,” Dr. Pieper explained. “Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer's reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.”\n\nChaubey, Kalyani et al. “Pharmacologic reversal of Alzheimer’s disease in mice reveals potential therapeutic nodes in human brain.” Cell Reports Medicine. DOI: 10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102535\n\nTags:\r\n Alzheimer's Disease, Aging",

    "fullText": "There is a fresh development in the case of former University of Kentucky competitive cheerleader Laken Snelling, who was accused of concealing the body of her newborn baby in a trash bag earlier this year.\n\nProsecutors requested medical records related to the case from the University of Kentucky Medical Center, according to court records obtained by The Courier-Journal.\n\nThe subpoena was delivered to the Medical Center earlier this month and returned on Monday, December 22.\n\nSnelling, 21, was arrested on August 30 and charged with abuse of a corpse, tampering with physical evidence and concealing the birth of an infant.\n\nKentucky Cheerleader Laken Snelling Ordered McDonald’s Shortly After Allegedly Concealing Birth of Baby\n\nThe cheerleader allegedly gave birth to the baby and then hid its body in a trash bag in the closet of her Lexington, Kentucky, home.\n\nOne of Snelling’s roommates called the police after allegedly finding a “blood-soaked towel on the floor and a plastic bag containing evidence of childbirth” in Snelling’s room.\n\nWhen Snelling was questioned by authorities, she “admitted to giving birth” and to “concealing the birth by cleaning any evidence, placing all cleaning items used inside of a black trash bag, including the infant, who was wrapped in a towel.”\n\nA search of Snelling’s phone found internet inquiries for “different things pertaining to pregnancy, images of her during labor, photos of her doing things ordinary pregnant women should not be doing and a concealed or hidden pregnancy.”\n\nSnelling alleged she “passed out” on top of the baby after giving birth, eventually waking up to find the infant’s body “blue and purple.”\n\nThe cheerleader asked to be “checked out” by medical professionals after arriving at police headquarters in Lexington, according to an incident report.\n\nSnelling pleaded not guilty to all charges and posted a $100,000 bail on September 2.\n\nDuring a court appearance on September 26, Snelling waived her right to a preliminary trial and is currently awaiting her grand jury trial.\n\nAfter her initial plea, Snelling was confined to house arrest and split time between her parents’ homes in Tennessee.\n\nA judge issued restrictions to her house arrest in October, with Snelling ordered to wear an ankle monitor and exclusively live at her father’s home. It is not clear why the judge issued the new guidelines.\n\nActivist Says There Was a Safe Haven Baby Box 10 Minutes From Cheerleader Laken Snelling’s Home\n\nThe infant’s cause of death was ruled inconclusive and “extensive microscopic analyses are essential to determine the cause and manner of death,” according to a report from the Fayette County Coroner’s Office obtained by Us Weekly on September 4.\n\n“I understand the community’s concern and sensitivity surrounding the death of a child,” Fayette County Coroner Gary Ginn said in the report. “We are conducting a thorough and methodical death investigation to ensure all facts are carefully considered.”\n\nAt the time of her arrest, Snelling was a student at the University of Kentucky and a three-year member of the school’s STUNT cheerleading team.\n\nA spokesperson for the school told Us on September 5 that Snelling “is no longer a student at the university and, as a result, is no longer a member of the STUNT team.”",

Hundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.  “Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University.",
    "fullText": "LEXINGTON, Neb. (AP) — On a frigid day after Mass at St. Ann’s Catholic Church in rural Nebraska, worshippers shuffled into the basement and sat on folding chairs, their faces barely masking the fear gripping their town.\n\nA pall hung over the room just as it hung over the holiday season in Lexington, Nebraska.\n\n“Suddenly they tell us that there’s no more work. Your world closes in on you,” said Alejandra Gutierrez.\n\nShe and the others work at Tyson Foods' beef plant and are among the 3,200 people who will lose their jobs when Lexington's biggest employer closes the plant next month after more than two decades of operation.\n\nHundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.\n\n“Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University. It will be “close to the poster child for hard times.”\n\nAll told, the job losses are expected to reach 7,000, largely in Lexington and the surrounding counties, according to estimates from University of Nebraska, Lincoln, shared with The Associated Press. Tyson employees alone will lose an estimated $241 million in pay and benefits annually.\n\nTyson says it's closing the plant to “right-size” its beef business after a historically low cattle herd in the U.S. and the company’s expected loss of $600 million on beef production next fiscal year.\n\nThe plant's closure threatens to unravel a Great Plains town where the American Dream was still attainable, where immigrants who didn't speak English and never graduated high school bought homes, raised children in a safe community and sent them to college.\n\nNow, those symbols of economic progress — mortgages and car payments, property taxes and tuition costs — are bills that thousands of Tyson workers won't have an income to pay.\n\nAt St. Ann's church, Gutierrez sat between her daughters and recalled being told of the plant closure just before Thanksgiving while she visited a college campus with her high school senior, Kimberly.\n\n“At that moment, my daughter said she no longer wanted to study,” Gutierrez said. “Because where would we get the money to pay for college?”\n\nA tear slipped down Kimberly's cheek as she looked at her mother and then down at her hands.\n\nIf you threw a dart at a map of the United States, Lexington — called “Lex” by locals — would be just about bullseye.\n\nIt's easy to miss driving down Interstate 80, half hidden by barren hackberry trees, corn fields and pastures of Black Angus cattle, but a driver can spy the plant's hulking industrial buildings pumping steam.\n\nThe plant opened in 1990 and was bought by Tyson 11 years later, attracting thousands of workers and nearly doubling the town's population within a decade.\n\nMany came from Los Angeles, then stricken by recession, including Lizeth Yanes, who initially hated what she called “a little ghost town.\"\n\nBut soon Lexington flourished, with suburbs sprouting among bur oak and American elm trees. The downtown, a strip of cobblestone streets and brick buildings, has a Somali grocer that abuts a Hispanic bakery; locals attend over a dozen churches and several city recreation centers.\n\nTo this day, the plant creates the town's rhythm as workers roll on and off the daily A, B and C shifts and fill restaurants, school pickup lines and the one-screen movie theater showing “Polar Express.”\n\n“It took a long time for me to actually enjoy this little place,” said Yanes. “Now that I enjoy it, now I have to leave.”\n\nThe atmosphere inside the Tyson plant, where workers process as many as 5,000 head of cattle a day, laboring on slaughter floors, cleaning crews or trimming cuts of meat, feels “like a funeral,” she said.\n\n“Tyson was our motherland,\" said plant worker Arab Adan. The Kenyan immigrant sat in his car with his two energetic sons, who asked him a question he has no answer to: “Which state are we gonna go, daddy?”\n\nThe only thing Adan is set on is that his kids finish the school year in Lexington, where school officials say nearly half of students have a parent working for Tyson.\n\nThe school district, where at least 20 languages and dialects are spoken, has higher high school graduation and college attendance rates than the state and national average, and one of Nebraska's biggest marching bands. Residents are proud of the diversity and the tightknit community, where young people return to raise families.\n\nDuring Mass at St. Ann's, parishioners gave the cash in their pockets to a fund for families in financial need, despite knowing they'll be out of work next month. Afterward, Francisco Antonio ran through his future employment options with a sad smile.\n\nAfter the plant closes on Jan. 20, the 52-year-old father of four said he'll stay a few months in Lexington and look for work, though “now there's no future.\" He took off his glasses, paused, apologized and tried to explain his emotions.\n\n“It’s home mostly, not the job,” he said, replacing his glasses with an embarrassed smile.\n\n“We need another opportunity, job, here in Lex,” he said. “Otherwise Lex is gonna disappear.”\n\nThe domino effect could go something like this: If 1,000 families skip town, said economist Hicks — who wouldn't be surprised if it were double that — seats would be left empty in schools, leading to teacher layoffs; there would be far fewer customers in restaurants, shops and other businesses.\n\nMost of the customers at Los Jalapenos, a Mexican restaurant down the street from the plant, are Tyson workers. They fill booths after work and are greeted by owner Armando Martinez’s mustachioed grin and bellow of “Hola, amigo!”\n\nMartinez’s grandson once told his grandfather that when he grows up he wants to work at Tyson. The child's fifth-grade sister recently gathered with classmates to talk about the changes happening with their parents. Some were headed to California, others to Kansas. All were in tears.\n\nIf he can't keep up with bills, the restaurant will close, but “there’s just nowhere we can go,\" said Martinez, who undergoes dialysis for diabetes, has an amputated foot and prays for a miracle: that Tyson will change its mind.\n\nHe knows it's unlikely. Asked by The Associated Press for comment about plans for the site, Tyson said in a statement that it “is currently assessing how we can repurpose the facility within our own production network.” It did not provide details, or say whether it plans to offer support to the community through the plant closure.\n\nMany, including City Manager Joe Pepplitsch, are hoping Tyson puts the plant up for sale and a new company comes in bringing jobs. That isn't a quick fix, requiring time, negotiations, renovations and no guarantee of comparable jobs.\n\n“Tyson owes this community a debt. I think they have a responsibility here to help ease some of the impact,” he said, noting Tyson doesn't pay city taxes due to a deal negotiated decades ago.\n\n‘It’s not easy, at our age, to go back and start over’\n\nNear the plant, at the Dawson County Fairgrounds, Tyson workers recently filled a long hall as state agencies — responding with the urgency of a natural disaster — offered information on retraining, writing a resume, filing for unemployment and avoiding scammers when selling homes.\n\nAttendees' faces were subdued, like listening to a doctor’s prognosis. “Your financial health is going to change,\" they were told. “Don’t ignore the bank, they will not go away.”\n\nMany of the older workers don’t speak English, haven’t graduated high school and aren’t computer savvy. The last application some filled out was decades ago.\n\n“We know only working in meat for Tyson, we don’t have any other experience,” said Adan, the Kenyan immigrant.\n\nBack at St. Ann's, workers echoed that concern.\n\n“They only want young people now,” said Juventino Castro, who's worked at Tyson for a quarter-century. “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the time I have left.”\n\nLupe Ceja said she's saved a little money, but it won’t last long. Luz Alvidrez has a cleaning gig that will sustain her for awhile. Others might return to Mexico for a time. Nobody has a clear plan.\n\n“It won’t be easy,” said Fernando Sanchez, a Tyson worker for 35 years who sat with his wife. “We started here from scratch and it’s time to start from scratch again.\"\n\nTears rolled down his wife's cheeks and he squeezed her hand.",

    "description": "Providence police Maj. David Lapatin explains how investigators grappled with four different leads before a fifth finally led to Claudio Neves Valente.",
    "fullText": "Some of the first Providence police major crimes detectives to set eyes on the scene of the Brown University shooting arrived as tactical police officers escorted survivors from the building on Dec. 13.\n\nThe detectives arrived intermittently in the early minutes of an investigation that would test their skills and consume nearly all of their time over the course of five days.\n\nAt times, some would go without sleep for more than 30 hours, according to the person in charge, Providence police Maj. David Lapatin.\n\nInvestigators from a collection of agencies would grapple with four different leads, some more promising than others, before a fifth lead put them on the path of Claudio Neves Valente, the man who authorities say carried out the shootings at Brown, killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and then took his own life in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire.\n\nThe fifth lead, based in large part on aid from a Brown alumnus and Reddit poster and subsequent investigative accomplishments, was a long way off as the team assembled just after the shooting.\n\nThe leaders of the teams on the scene in those early minutes, including Lapatin, saw the victims, Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, in the auditorium-style classroom. They saw dozens of spent cartridge shells. Backpacks and other paraphernalia were strewn around. Bullets had penetrated some of the seats.\n\nLapatin spoke to a small group of detective supervisors.\n\n\"I just told them, 'Look, we've got to take the chaos out of our heads and just concentrate,'\" he says.\n\n\"They all stepped to it,\" he recalls. \"They're all professionals.\"\n\nInvestigators from the crime scene processing team, the Bureau of Criminal Identification, were on the job. Agents from the many federal agencies were already on their way to join in the manhunt. State police handled emergency calls and some routine calls.\n\nManaging the surviving students safely and appropriately for investigative purposes was one of the tasks at hand. They were removed from the building.\n\n\"We wanted to keep as many as we can in a safe place so we could question them later,\" Lapatin says.\n\nAs the survivors waited to talk to detectives, investigators wanted the group at least separated from other people prior to the interviews. The preference, to separate such witnesses from each other, wasn't possible based on conditions.\n\n\"We didn't have much choice,\" Lapatin said.\n\n\"There was a lot of them, a lot in the beginning,\" he added, saying that there were also a lot of police officers with them as well.\n\nWere investigators worried the killer might be in the group?\n\n\"That was always a thought, but we really didn't think so, because, you know, we had some people saying the suspect went out the door,\" Lapatin says.\n\nOther investigators were already in a room at Brown University where screens showed video from campus surveillance cameras. A clip recorded by a camera drew attention, Lapatin says.\n\n\"And what stood out was this man,\" Lapatin recalls.\n\n\"This man, you know, in dark clothing with the face mask, which at the end turned out to be the suspect,\" he says.\n\nThe man was not holding a gun in the video that was drawing the most attention.\n\n\"It was after the shooting,\" Lapatin said.\n\n\"He was walking,\" he said. \"Everybody else was running.\"\n\nIn time, investigators would come to believe that the gun was hidden.\n\n\"Our belief was that he had the satchel now under his coat, with the gun inside,\" Lapatin says.\n\nLapatin and other detectives set up a command post in a building next door.\n\nCalls flowed in from other law enforcement agencies. Federal personnel from the FBI, ATF and Homeland Security Investigations joined the scene.\n\nProvidence police were \"leading\" the investigation, Lapatin says.\n\n\"That was without question,\" he says.\n\nA lead agency has to be established for organizational reasons, he says.\n\nIt was important to make sure there were no \"wildcat\" investigators and \"that everybody is on the same page.\"\n\nTwo major leads took shape during the first 12 hours of the investigation, Lapatin says.\n\nOne, based on a tip from an \"outside agency,\" involved a person who had applied for a gun permit, Lapatin says.\n\nThe information involved a person staying at the Hampton Inn in Coventry just off Interstate 95. He was detained as a person of interest before dawn early Sunday morning, Dec. 14.\n\nThe investigators saw \"some guns and other things,\" Lapatin says. They needed to look into it further.\n\n\"And that's what they did. They checked him out.\"\n\nThe news that someone had been detained was a relief for Rhode Islanders.\n\nBut not for investigators, according to Lapatin.\n\nAnd when the Coventry lead failed to pan out, investigators were not saddled with a big emotional letdown either, he says.\n\nThey had never let their hopes lift that high in the first place, Lapatin says, adding that their search for other leads had continued without pause.\n\n\"We never skipped a beat,\" he said.\n\nA second tip worthy of investigation had also emerged early Sunday morning, Lapatin says: Multiple people had referred police to a man who lived near the university.\n\nBrown had sent out an email asking anyone who was in the building to contact police. The same man called to tell police he had been in the building the day before the shooting.\n\n\"He had an alibi and he was cleared,\" says Lapatin.\n\n\"We decided we needed to take this back to our home grounds,\" Lapatin says.\n\nThe large suite of offices that houses Providence detectives, as well as the department's new Real Time Crime Center, is on one end of the floor.\n\nIn a separate section at the other end, investigators set up in a room where they could work on the tips that were flowing into the station on a designated phone line that was advertised to the public.\n\nThe Providence police team that processes crime scenes for evidence, led by Lt. Robert Papa, remained at Brown with their counterparts in the FBI.\n\nThe first daylight on Sunday helped.\n\nLapatin says they knew what they would do. They needed to methodically collect and view as much video as possible in the neighborhoods close to the scene and then work outward.\n\n\"It's one of our best chances of solving the case,\" Lapatin said.\n\nHowever, other investigators stayed at the safety complex.\n\n\"We had two rooms filled with people on computers,\" he said. \"That's all they did, sit on the computers all day. And then in the Real Time Crime Center, there was more people on computers. These people sat there for hours and hours and hours and just went through things without moving.\"\n\nMost of them were FBI analysts.\n\nLapatin says he had made contact with Wing Chau, the U.S. Marshal for Rhode Island. Chau added marshals to the massive force of investigators.\n\nAgents from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Homeland Security Investigations were already part of the team.\n\nAt Lapatin's request, Brown police Lt. John Carvalho, also the acting deputy chief of Brown's police department and a former Providence police sergeant, joined the team in place on the third floor.\n\nSome of the special technology from the FBI could help gather information from cellular communications. The bureau also had special tech tools for dealing with video and for quickly checking on criminal history, Lapatin says.\n\nThe ATF personnel contributed skills and capabilities for analyzing firearms and spent ammunition and shells. Some rounds that were not fired at the scene were found at the scene. They were checked for DNA. Some samples were obtained.\n\nThe evidence was driven to Connecticut's state crime lab in Meriden for analysis.\n\nThe Providence police remained the lead investigative agency, Lapatin says. Still, they prepared for the possibility of supporting a case for prosecution in federal court if necessary.\n\nRhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha is a former U.S. Attorney, and two high-ranking prosecutors in his office – Deputy Attorney General Adi Goldstein and the chief of Neronha's criminal division, Stephen Dambruch – also had extensive experience as federal prosecutors.\n\nThey were in a group of prosecutors stationed in Lapatin's office.\n\nThe tip center had about 15 investigators working the phones and recording the tips. Workflow benefited from an FBI system that funneled the tips into a bin where everyone could see them, Lapatin says.\n\n\"And the other thing that's going,\" Lapatin says, \"that's full force now, is our Real Time Crime Center.\"\n\nThe crime center, which launched this past summer, has links to more than 300 live cameras, police say.\n\nIf investigators looking at those cameras can identify a suspect or person of interest to follow, the center is designed to help them track the person across multiple video feeds from one location to another.\n\nThe center is not staffed around the clock, Lapatin says.\n\n\"If something happens, we always have somebody who can jump right in there,\" he says, adding that somebody was probably in the center \"minutes\" after the shooting.\n\nOn Monday morning, Dec. 15, as the public reacted to news about the Coventry lead not panning out, investigators focused on a third tip.\n\nThree different calls, each of them regarding the same man, were received in the tip center, Lapatin says.\n\nThe man's size and physique lined up. One caller said they thought the man might have worked at Brown in the past.\n\nThe investigation surveilled the person.\n\n\"That involved watching him go through his daily routines,\" Lapatin says.\n\nInvestigators hoped to pick up something, perhaps some trash, that would provide a sample of DNA.\n\n\"We had a team on him, waiting for an opportunity to get some DNA,\" he says.\n\nThe work on that angle of the case would continue for days, even as the investigation ultimately focused heavily on Neves Valente.\n\nAs of late Monday night, investigators had gone through thousands of minutes of video.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, they established seven grids to search for video, Lapatin says. Prior to this, the search for cameras was organized by individual streets.\n\nThe search for video gained organization and efficiency by examining each house for potential cameras. Sometimes, street investigators obtained video. Other times, specialists went to extract the video. Lapatin estimates that each grid had 100 or 150 properties.\n\n\"It was time-consuming,\" he says. \"I know people were anxious. It was being worked.\"\n\nInvestigators hoped that a surveillance video would lead them to a better image of the masked suspect or even to a car associated with him.\n\n\"So lead three is hanging out there,\" Lapatin says. \"Lead one's gone. Lead two is gone.\"\n\nOn Tuesday a post on Reddit started to draw a lot of attention from investigators.\n\nThe post referred to a gray Nissan with Florida plates parked by the Rhode Island Historical Society. It also mentioned a man who'd acted strangely, locking and unlocking the car with a key fob.\n\n\"It looks pretty good,\" Lapatin says.\n\nInvestigators, based on video from the area, were already aware of movements by the masked man on Cooke Street prior to the shooting as well as some sort of contact he'd had with another person.\n\nBut their video did not show any car, Lapatin says.\n\nAnd they would learn that that other person was the Reddit poster.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, Dec. 16 and 17, long before they finally interviewed the Reddit poster on Wednesday night, investigators worked to track down a gray Nissan with a Florida plate.\n\nThe gray Nissan represented the fourth major lead in the case. Investigators focused on a woman who owned such a vehicle with a Florida plate. When the detectives looked into it, they found that the vehicle had been observed in the area.\n\nAlso, the woman had a close relative who may have fit the profile, Lapatin says.\n\nAfter a lot of surveillance, they felt the lead wasn't the strongest, Lapatin says. They talked to the woman at work and corroborated that she had told them the truth about where she had been during the time in question. That lead was ruled out.\n\n\"It was a fluke,\" Lapatin says.\n\nThe fifth and final lead, the one that would take police to the shooter, a Miami man, emerged as investigators continued to look for a Nissan of any color with a Florida plate.\n\nCapt. Dennis P. O'Brien said that more than 100 investigators had worked stints of more than 20 hours at a time, or longer, without sleep. O'Brien recalls working 31 hours on one shift. The teams didn't quit on the Nissan.\n\nProvidence police detectives, including Detective Joseph Nezier and Detective Mitch Guerra, and state police Detective Sgt. Robert Hopkins and several others, digested great amounts of video to try to see the Nissan in the area. They also ran searches within the system of networked license-plate reading cameras on the East Side.\n\nThe information provided by the system showed that a blue Nissan had been on North Main Street, at Randall Street near Whole Foods, on dates in early December and in the area on the day before the shooting, Lapatin says.\n\nThe blue Nissan was identified in the North Main Street, Doyle Street, Camp Street area, Lapatin says.\n\nSimultaneously, investigators were still working to make contact with the man who had authored the post on Reddit.\n\nTo get his IP address, investigators had to get a subpoena, Lapatin says, adding that the FBI handled that.\n\nOn Wednesday night, investigators interviewed the Reddit poster.\n\nThe man who wrote the Reddit post had graduated from Brown University in 2010, Lapatin says. Where he actually lived wasn't perfectly clear to investigators, Lapatin acknowledges. Detectives didn't push that issue.\n\n\"We needed to know more important information,\" he says.\n\nIt was clear that the man, who has a cell phone, had spent a lot of time on the streets, frequently used the bathroom in the engineering building and was familiar enough and protective enough to spot someone who didn't belong there, Lapatin says.\n\n\"So he comes in,\" Lapatin says, referring to the Reddit poster, \"and he's very well-spoken. And he explains exactly what happened.\"\n\nThe masked man had raised his suspicions during an encounter in the building.\n\nHis post on Reddit, about a gray Nissan, had channeled the investigation toward Neves Valente.\n\n\"That was it from there, the hunt was on,\" Lapatin says.",

    "fullText": "Purdue University's next batch of freshmen will be subjected to a surprising new requirement, according to a Forbes contributor.\n\nLast Friday, a university press release introduced a new graduation requirement starting in 2026: \"AI working competency.\"\n\nPurdue's announcement identified five \"areas\" — Learning with AI, Learning about AI, Research AI, Using AI, and Partnering in AI — in which undergrads would be expected to demonstrate proficiency.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been a prominent social and economic topic throughout 2025, and its impact on education, particularly at the university level, has been disruptive.\n\nIn October, the journal Nature observed that institutions were \"embracing\" AI and questioned whether it would accelerate learning or sabotage it. Recent editorials in Current Affairs and the Guardian postulated that AI was \"undermining\" education.\n\nJust as AI began firmly planting itself in school systems, parents of younger students began to distrust the technology's role in education, and college professors have vocally objected to its use and its potential to erode skill and knowledge.\n\nThe yet-to-be-seen impact of AI on education at all levels is just one of the controversies dogging this emerging technology. Market experts have warned that the AI \"arms race\" is little more than a bubble, a concern Google's CEO acknowledged had merit.\n\nRising electricity costs were another big news story in 2025, and a sharp increase in energy bills has repeatedly been linked to the AI data center boom.\n\nMuch of the United States' electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels, meaning these costs are paid not just in currency but also in increased harmful carbon pollution. Data centers also strain water resources, but tech firms are slow to disclose these impacts.\n\nOn the other hand, AI has shown promise for improving environmental problems, and if managed sustainably, the technology could cause less harm and more good. Research found AI could boost crop yields and perhaps eliminate supply chain waste efficiently.\n\nDo you worry about robots taking away our jobs?\n\nYes — but it will create new ones too\n\nPossibly — but not significantly\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIn academia, however, Purdue University's announcement was met with widespread scorn, in no small part because AI has acquired a reputation for supercharging plagiarism, particularly in scholarly and creative settings.\n\nSocial media users were also skeptical of Purdue's new commitment to AI.\n\n\"The concept of demonstrating 'competency' in a tool that's primarily a shortcut for incompetent people,\" a user who linked to the Forbes piece lamented.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (USF) – The University of Sioux Falls Men’s Basketball team closed the calendar year with offensive performance, knocking off Minnesota State 98–90 on Saturday afternoon inside the Stewart Center. Behind balanced scoring, dominance on the glass, and an aggressive approach against the Mavericks’ size, the Cougars earned a statement NSIC victory heading into the holiday break.\n\nSioux Falls leaned into its physicality and depth to secure the win, finishing with four players scoring 16 or more points and posting a decisive rebounding edge. USF shot 42.5 percent from the field while generating 52 points in the paint and 23 second-chance points. Bryon Laue delivered a breakout performance with 18 points and a game-high 16 rebounds, while Brandon Hrncir and Brogan Madson each added 18 points as the Cougars consistently attacked mismatches.\n\nThe Cougars took control at the free-throw line and in transition during the second half, converting 24-of-28 free throws after the break and scoring 22 fast-break points for the game. Jacoby Mehrman added 16 points on efficient shooting, and Camden Davis chipped in 10 points off the bench as USF outscored Minnesota State 54–49 in the second half to close out the 98–90 victory.\n\nThe opening 20 minutes featured a steady back-and-forth, with Sioux Falls building offense through paint touches and extra possessions. USF shot 43.6 percent from the field in the half and generated early success on the offensive glass, finishing the game with 23 offensive rebounds. Laue set the tone early on the boards, while Hrncir and Madson combined to keep the Cougars in rhythm offensively.\n\nMinnesota State shot efficiently in the first half at 47.2 percent, but Sioux Falls countered by limiting perimeter damage and forcing the Mavericks to earn points inside. The Cougars went 8-of-11 at the free-throw line in the half and carried a 44–41 advantage into the locker room.\n\nSioux Falls seized control after halftime by attacking relentlessly and capitalizing at the stripe. The Cougars scored 54 second-half points and went 24-of-28 at the free-throw line, repeatedly punishing Minnesota State for fouling. Mehrman and Hrncir were effective in finishing through contact, while Madson orchestrated the offense and drew fouls attacking downhill.\n\nAlthough Minnesota State shot 51.5 percent in the half and scored 49 points, USF offset that efficiency with rebounding, transition scoring, and second-chance opportunities.

    "fullText": "As investigators work to find a motive behind the mass shooting at Brown University and the slaying of an acclaimed MIT professor, former classmates of the accused killer described him as a brilliant but exceptionally difficult student.\n\nClaudio Neves Valente, the 48-year-old suspect who police say was found dead Thursday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was a top student but a disruptive personality in his native Portugal, recalled classmates on Friday.\n\nNeves Valente studied at Instituto Superior Técnico along with Nuno Loureiro, the MIT professor he is now accused of shooting to death. The school confirmed to CNN that both men were students there between 1995 and 2000, and that Neves Valente studied for a degree in Technological Physics Engineering.\n\nThat engineering course was full of gifted students, recalled classmate Felipe Moura – but Neves Valente stood out, for good and bad reasons.\n\n“Claudio was obviously one of the best, but in class he had a great need to stand out and show that he was better than the rest,” Moura wrote in Portuguese in a Facebook post.\n\n“Claudio’s attitude was unpleasant,” he continued, often arguing with “colleagues he didn’t consider as brilliant as him (and who probably weren’t),” he wrote. “They were totally unnecessary quarrels, which did not help the class at all.”\n\nMoura, who now teaches at a Lisbon university, did not respond to messages from CNN. A former classmate, who asked not to be quoted by name, confirmed that Moura’s Facebook account was authentic.\n\nIn an interview with Público, a newspaper in Portugal, Moura echoed his impressions of Neves Valente as an aggressive classmate.\n\n“He had a confrontational personality in class. In other words, the other good students would intervene, ask questions, [but] Claudio liked to say that he was the one who knew,” Moura told the paper.\n\nNuno Morais, another classmate, told Público that Neves Valente and Loureiro were among the top students at the school – but their personalities were starkly different.\n\n“Claudio was one of the students with the best grades in the course. He was much more theoretical,” Morais told the paper. “Nuno was also a good student, he stood out less in terms of grades, but he was a more relaxed person—and seemed to have a knack for slightly more applied subjects.”\n\nAfter graduating in Portugal, Neves Valente enrolled at Brown University in 2000 as a graduate student in physics but did not finish the program. Moura said he stayed in touch with Neves Valente at the time and found that he was once again clashing with other students.\n\n“I exchanged many emails with him at the time and saw that he maintained the same attitude — as he told me —of maintaining unnecessary conflicts with PhD colleagues in class, which he again considered far less capable than he was,” Moura wrote on Facebook. “I could tell that he wasn’t enjoying being at Brown University.”\n\nScott Watson, a classmate at Brown, said Valente was “socially awkward” and that he became his only friend at the university. He struggled in the US, complaining bitterly that classes weren’t challenging and that the food was poor, Watson recalled.\n\n“He would say the classes were too easy—honestly, for him they were. He already knew most of the material and was genuinely impressive,” Watson, who is now a professor at Syracuse University, said in a statement shared with CNN.\n\nWatson said Valente could be “kind and gentle” but that he was also volatile as well.\n\n“He often became frustrated—sometimes angry—about courses, professors, and living conditions,” Watson said, recalling that once he had to break up a fight between Valente and another classmate he often insulted.\n\nMoura said he tried to convince Valente to stay with the graduate program, but he left after one year.\n\n“Claudio thought none of it was worth it, which was a waste of time and the others were all incapable,” he said on Facebook.\n\nIn an archived Brown website, Neves Valente appears to write to classmates that he’s left the school “permanently.” The note, first reported by the New York Times, includes an email address to reach him and a cryptic note: “The best liar is he who is able to fool himself. They are everywhere, but sometimes proliferate in the most unexpected places.”\n\nA directory of physics graduate students at Brown from that time links to the website alongside a student email address for Neves Valente. The directory shows that he was assigned to room 122 at the Barus and Holley engineering building. Neves Valente carried out his shooting in room 166 in the same building last week, police say.\n\nIt’s unclear what Neves Valente did in the intervening years. Moura wrote on Facebook that he heard he’d returned to Portugal to work for an internet provider; police say he received a visa and returned to the US in 2017, though it is unclear what he did for work.\n\nHis last known address was in Miami, police said.\n\nHis former classmates have been left trying to understand what could have motivated the brutal violence.\n\n“I never expected he would be capable of such a thing,” Moura wrote.\n\nCNN’s Vasco Cotovio, Thomas Bordeaux, Julia Vargas Jones contributed to this report.",

    "description": "A Reddit user provided information that helped identify Claudio Manuel Neves Valente as the suspect not only in the campus shooting but also in the murder of an M.I.T. professor.",
    "fullText": "Three days after the deadly shooting at Brown University, officers received an anonymous tip that stuck out from a flood of information. It directed the authorities to a post on Reddit.\n\n“I’m being dead serious. The police need to look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental,” the Reddit user posted, according to an affidavit filed by the police in Providence, R.I.\n\nThat tip would later lead to a breakthrough not only in the search for the campus attacker but also the hunt for the suspect in the murder of a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It also ended the dayslong manhunt that had put both the Brown and M.I.T. communities on edge.\n\nA day after the Reddit post was made, the writer approached law enforcement officials and told them about his encounter with a suspicious man in Brown University’s Barus and Holley building.\n\nThe information “blew this case right open,” Attorney General Peter F. Neronha of Rhode Island said in a news conference Thursday.\n\nThe tipster, whom the police referred to only as John, said that he encountered the suspect inside a bathroom on the ground floor of the building between 1:45 p.m. and 2 p.m., around two hours before the first shots were reported. John said that the suspect’s clothing was inappropriate for the weather and that they had made eye contact.\n\nJohn told the police that he followed the man after he left the building to a Nissan with a Florida plate. But instead of entering the vehicle, the suspect started walking around the block, with John behind him. John said it was like “a game of cat and mouse.”\n\nAt one point, the two men spoke. According to the affidavit, John asked the suspect, “Your car is back there, why are you circling the block?” To which the suspect responded, “Why are you harassing me?” John went his own way soon after.\n\nMayor Brett P. Smiley of Providence told CNN that the Reddit tipster was a Brown graduate who had been pictured in a photograph released by the police. However, John wrote on Reddit on Thursday that he is not the man in the photograph.\n\n“He provided the Reddit tip initially. Anonymously,” Mr. Smiley said. “And then when we put the photo out and put the call out that we needed to talk to this person, he then turned up to a Providence police officer and was fully forthcoming. And so it’s sort of an amazing sequence of events, but really turned out to be critical to our investigation. We’re grateful to him.”\n\nWhen the police showed John images of the suspect’s car from safety cameras, he said: “That might be it.”\n\nIt was the breakthrough the authorities had been looking for.\n\nThe suspect’s vehicle was a key detail in the investigation. A Brown University faculty member had also described a suspicious vehicle in the same neighborhood, a gray sedan with Florida plates. It did not take long for investigators to find that the car was from an Alamo rental location in downtown Boston.\n\nAnd from the rental agreement, they got a name: Claudio Manuel Neves Valente.\n\nThen came more information about the suspect: He was a Portuguese national. Brown University said he was a former student, enrolled from the fall of 2000 through the 2001 spring semester. He was there for a Ph.D. in physics, but withdrew from that program in 2003.\n\nTravel records showed that years later, in 2017, Mr. Neves Valente returned to the United States as a legal permanent resident.\n\nAt this point, the investigations into the Brown University shooting and the murder three days later of Nuno F.G. Loureiro, a professor at M.I.T., appeared to converge.\n\nThrough surveillance footage, investigators tracked the gray Nissan to near Dr. Loureiro’s home. They also determined that the suspect drove that car to a storage unit in Salem, N.H., where they found the body of Mr. Neves Valente, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, on Thursday night.\n\nThe investigators now also knew that Mr. Neves Valente had rented hotel rooms in Boston, as well as that storage unit. And according to Leah B. Foley, the U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, Mr. Neves Valente and Dr. Loureiro had attended the same academic program in Portugal from 1995 to 2000.\n\nAt some point after the shooting at Brown, the plates on the suspect’s car were changed from Florida to Maine, Ms. Foley added.\n\nThe suspect’s motives in both attacks remain under investigation.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of unknowns,” said Mr. Neronha, the attorney general of Rhode Island. “In terms of why Brown? I think that’s a mystery.”\n\nVictor Mather contributed reporting.",

Our earlier story is below.\n\nLaw enforcement are investigating possible connections between the mass shooting at Brown University and the targeted killing of an MIT professor two days later, sources told CBS News.\n\nInvestigators are searching for a suspect in the mass shooting and a car that the person is believed to have rented, multiple law enforcement sources said. Authorities believe the rented vehicle is the same make and model of a car that was also detected in the vicinity of the MIT professor's apartment.\n\nMeanwhile, two law enforcement sources also told CBS News that an arrest warrant has been issued for a suspect in the Brown shooting.\n\nNuno Loureiro, who taught plasma physics at MIT and led its Plasma Science and Fusion Center, was shot Monday at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts. He died at a nearby hospital the next day. Police are investigating his death as a homicide.\n\nTwo days earlier, two students were killed and nine more were wounded when a gunman opened fire Saturday afternoon inside a classroom on Brown University's campus in Providence, Rhode Island, authorities said. The shooting occurred in the school's Barus & Holley engineering building during final exams.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting, police said a male suspect had managed to escape from the building. In the hours and days that followed, police and the FBI released images and videos of the man they described as a person of interest walking around a nearby neighborhood several hours before the first 911 calls reporting the shooting came in.\n\nThe person in the images wore black clothing and a face mask. None of the footage pictured him clearly.\n\nA video released on Tuesday, though blurry, was the clearest picture of the person of interest released so far. The image appeared to be digitally enhanced.\n\nJohn Mulvaney, an FBI veteran of 26 years and the managing director of CBIZ Forensix Consulting Group, told CBS News Boston the footage appeared to show the person of interest \"casing the neighborhood.\"\n\nThe FBI is offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the shooting.\n\nThe two students killed in the shooting were identified as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an Uzbek American freshman student.\n\n\"Both were brilliant and beloved — as members of our campus community, but even more by their friends and families,\" Brown's president, Christina H. Paxson, wrote in a letter Tuesday to the university community. \"Our hearts continue to be with them in their profound sorrow.\"\n\nPerson of interest identified in deadly Brown University shooting\n\nWhat to expect from Trump's address to the nation\n\nNew surveillance video shows Nick Reiner before his arrest",

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on the social platform X that, at Trump’s direction, she is ordering the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the program.  “This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” she said of the suspect, Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump suspended the green card lottery program on Thursday that allowed the suspect in the Brown University and MIT shootings to come to the United States.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on the social platform X that, at Trump’s direction, she is ordering the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the program.\n\n“This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” she said of the suspect, Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente.\n\nNeves Valente, 48, is suspected in the shootings at Brown University that killed two students and wounded nine others, and the killing of an MIT professor. He was found dead Thursday evening from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.\n\nNeves Valente had studied at Brown on a student visa beginning in 2000, according to an affidavit from a Providence police detective. In 2017, he was issued a diversity immigrant visa and months later obtained legal permanent residence status, according to the affidavit. It was not immediately clear where he was between taking a leave of absence from the school in 2001 and getting the visa in 2017.\n\nThe diversity visa program makes up to 50,000 green cards available each year by lottery to people from countries that are little represented in the U.S., many of them in Africa. The lottery was created by Congress, and the move is almost certain to invite legal challenges.\n\nNearly 20 million people applied for the 2025 visa lottery, with more than 131,000 selected when including spouses with the winners. After winning, they must undergo vetting to win admission to the United States. Portuguese citizens won only 38 slots.\n\nLottery winners are invited to apply for a green card. They are interviewed at consulates and subject to the same requirements and vetting as other green-card applicants.\n\nTrump has long opposed the diversity visa lottery. Noem’s announcement is the latest example of using tragedy to advance immigration policy goals. After an Afghan man was identified as the gunman in a fatal attack on National Guard members in November, Trump’s administration imposed sweeping rules against immigration from Afghanistan and other counties.\n\nWhile pursuing mass deportation, Trump has sought to limit or eliminate avenues to legal immigration. He has not been deterred if they are enshrined in law, like the diversity visa lottery, or the Constitution, as with a right to citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil. The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear his challenge to birthright citizenship.",

    "description": "Authorities announced they tracked down the man responsible for the deadly Brown University shooting that rocked the Ivy League institution.",
    "fullText": "Authorities on Dec. 18 announced they tracked down the man responsible for both the deadly Brown University shooting and the shooting death of Nuno F.G. Loureiro, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor two days later, and found him dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a Salem, Massachusetts storage unit.\n\nClaudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, originally from Portugal, was a former Brown University PhD physics student, who knew Loureiro, authorities said at two separate news conferences on the night of Dec. 18.\n\nInvestigators said they identified Valente on the afternoon of Dec. 17 and were able to connect him to both crime scenes through financial background information, including car rental records for the car he rented and drove to Providence and back to Massachusetts.\n\nThe Brown shootings rocked the Ivy League School and the school's surrounding community.\n\nAuthorities at the news conference in Boston, said Valente was \"sophisticated in covering his tracks,\" including obscuring his cell phone so it couldn't be tracked, switching plates on his rental car andnot using credit cards in his name.\n\nAn affidavit signed by a Rhode Island district judge said police cracked the case after a tipster recognized a rental car circling the area. The tipster said police should be looking for a gray Nissan Altima and license plate, information the police hadn't previously released. Police then tracked down images of Neves Valente renting the car at an Alamo location in Boston.\n\nHere's what to know about the shooter:\n\nNeves Valente entered the country in 2000 on a student F-1 visa. He was admitted as a lawful permanent resident in 2017.\n\nBrown officials say he was a PhD student before taking a leave of absence in April 2001. He withdrew on July 31, 2003. His last known address was in Miami, according to police.\n\nThe tipster took his information first to the social media site Reddit, posting: \"I'm being dead serious. The police need to look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental,\" John, whose last name is being withheld by authorities, wrote, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe announcement comes after authorities urged the public to help with the widening investigation and dayslong search for the person suspected of carrying out the attack. Earlier in the week, authorities released enhanced images and video footage of the person investigators believe could be tied to the shooting that killed two people and injured nine others.\n\nProvidence Police Chief Oscar Perez said investigators had evidence that the possible suspect was near the university hours before the shooting. Footage from neighborhood cameras shared by authorities showed the person in dark clothing and wearing a mask walking along streets a few blocks away from the campus on Dec. 13.\n\nInvestigators believe it was likely the person was \"casing\" the scene, according to Perez.\n\n\"There's a lot of leads we have here that show that the person who committed this tragedy is the guy in this video,\" the police chief said.\n\nThough officials said on Dec. 16 that they were confident the person in the video is the suspect, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha noted that they had \"zero\" evidence for the motive in the attack. Witnesses said the person was likely in his 30s, and it was unclear if they were affiliated with the university, Perez said.\n\n'Bright light' and 'role model.' Brown University victims remembered\n\nPolice received more than 200 tips since the shooting, according to Perez. The police chief had asked for the public’s help in identifying the suspected gunman, saying investigators were hoping the new footage would help someone recognize the person.\n\n\"Focus on the body movements, the way the person moved their arms, the body posture, the way they carry the weight,\" Perez said. “I think those are important movement patterns that may help you identify this individual, which is extremely important.”\n\nThe footage included a timeline video that comprised surveillance video from neighborhood cameras and a vehicle’s dash camera.\n\nIn one video, the suspected shooter can be seen leaving the scene of the shooting as a police car with flashing emergency lights arrives. The final video shows the suspect walking along that street just minutes after the attack.\n\nThe shooting at the Ivy League University occurred shortly before 4:05 p.m. local time on Dec. 13 in an engineering building with unlocked doors as final exams were underway. Authorities said the suspect opened fire with a 9mm gun inside a classroom and then fled.\n\nThe shooting prompted a campus lockdown that left students barricaded in rooms or hiding for hours. Officers recovered 9mm shell casings from the scene, and Perez said investigators believe the suspect \"definitely targeted Brown University.\"\n\nTwo students were killed, and nine others were injured in the attack. The two students killed were identified as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Mountain Brook, Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, a freshman from Virginia who immigrated from Uzbekistan.\n\nAs of Dec. 16, two of the wounded students were released from the hospital. Of the seven people who remained hospitalized, authorities said one was in critical condition, five were in critical but stable condition, and one was in stable condition.\n\nBrown University, which has nearly 11,000 undergraduate and graduate students, is considered one of the most prestigious colleges in the country. Brown was founded in 1764 and is located in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Brown, MIT suspect found dead.

    "description": "Investigators found evidence linking deadly shootings at Brown University and MIT, as authorities probe connection between campus attacks, according to a report.",
    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Investigators in New England have identified the suspected Brown University shooter and are looking into whether there is a link to the murder of an award-winning nuclear scientist 50 miles away at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sources tell Fox News.\n\nHe remains at large, and authorities have obtained a warrant, according to the sources. They confirmed that officers are in Salem, New Hampshire, where the suspected shooter’s abandoned car was found near a storage facility.\n\nPolice scanner audio reveals police were searching for a gray Nissan Sentra with Maine plates in Salem, New Hampshire, in connection with a homicide in Brookline, Massachusetts, where MIT nuclear physicist Nuno Loureiro was found with gunshot wounds in his apartment Monday night.\n\nTrump Urges Capture Of 'Animal' Gunman In Brown University Shooting, Says No Motive Yet\n\nEarlier this week, FBI Boston's special agent in charge Ted Docks told reporters that investigators were sharing intelligence regarding both cases but had not come up with a clear tie.\n\nUnverified reports in both Providence, Rhode Island, and Brookline, Massachusetts, have described Nissan Sentras at the scene, although they were described as having license plates from different states.\n\nOn Thursday, the regional CBS affiliate WPRI-TV reported that senior law enforcement sources said they have discovered evidence of a connection. It's unclear what that evidence is.\n\nA masked gunman barged into a lecture hall at Brown University in Providence around 4 p.m. Saturday and killed two students, injuring nine more. Authorities said they recovered 9mm bullet casings from the scene.\n\nA person of interest was seen Saturday a few minutes later on surveillance video in the neighborhood east of Brown's campus.\n\n'Older' Brown Building Where Shooting Happened Had No Cameras As President’s Even Older Home Appears Equipped\n\nThen around 8:30 p.m. Monday, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno F. Gomes Loureiro, 47, was discovered with multiple gunshot wounds in his apartment in Brookline, a short drive from campus. He was pronounced dead at a hospital the following morning.\n\nLoureiro was a renowned nuclear physicist, director of MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center and a recipient of a presidential award honoring his research from the White House earlier this year.\n\nAuthorities have not described what kind of weapon was used to kill Loureiro.\n\nThe shooting left two students dead, identified as Ella Cook of Alabama and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov of Virginia, and nine injured. Six of the survivors remained hospitalized as of Thursday afternoon. One is in critical but stable condition, the others were stable.\n\nFox News' Sandy Ibrahim contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

He’s good on the edge. He’s fast. He’s played inside a little bit. He’s played on the edge.”\n\nGainer recorded 27 tackles and 2.5 sacks in his one season at UNC. He finished his college career with 237 total tackles.\n\n“He played inside at Florida State, if I remember, in college,” Maye said. “He moved to the edge once he got to North Carolina. So, I know he was with Vegas, and it’s good to see him back. I think everybody’s just trying to see what they can do just to help us, whether it’s on game day, throughout practice or whatever he can do.”\n\nGainer appeared in 17 games as a rookie with the Las Vegas Raiders, playing mostly in a special teams capacity. The 25-year-old provides good size to the practice squad and a great motor, according to Maye.\n\n“I know he’s going to work hard, and I know he’s got a good work ethic,” Maye said.\n\nMike Vrabel-Bashing Radio Host Shreds Patriots Coach Amid Josh McDaniels Debate",

    "fullText": "Providence police on Wednesday afternoon released an “enhanced” image of a person seen near the man identified as a person of interest in the shooting at Brown University on Saturday that killed two students and injured nine.\n\nTo date, it is the clearest image released by police in the ongoing manhunt for the person responsible for the mass shooting at the Ivy League university in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nIn the photo, the unidentified person is seen wearing a black jat, a hooded sweatshirt, a black hat and glasses. Police say the person in the photo was \"in proximity of the person of interest.\"\n\nAnyone who recognizes the person, or with information about the shooting, is urged to call the tip line at 401-272-3121.\n\nAs the manhunt for the gunman who took the lives of two students stretches into Wednesday, investigators say their highest priority is identifying a person of interest they’ve released numerous photos and videos of. Officials said during a Tuesday evening press conference that they believe this is the critical next step in charging someone in the shooting.\n\n“Once we identify who this person is, I believe we’ll be able to locate them,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said.\n\nGunfire erupted on the first floor of Brown’s Barus and Holley engineering and physics building around 4 p.m. on Dec. 13 during an economics class. The shooting left sophomore Ella Cook and first-year student Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov dead and nine other students injured.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, one of the injured students was in critical condition, five more were in critical but stable condition, and one was in stable condition, according to law enforcement and Brown University. Two have been released from Rhode Island Hospital.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have described the person of interest as being approximately 5-foot-8 inches tall with a “stocky build.” Photos and videos shared by police show what appears to be man dressed in dark clothing, including a beanie and face mask, walking down the street near Brown University approximately two hours before the shooting.\n\nOfficials have asked anyone associated with Brown or who lives or spends time around Providence to review the photos and videos of the person of interest. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the “identification, arrest and conviction of the individual.”\n\nProvidence Police Chief Col. Oscar L. Perez, Jr. advised the public to focus on the body movements of the person of interest shown in the videos during the press conference Tuesday evening.\n\n“You wanna focus on the body movements, the way the person moved their arms, the body posture, the way they carry their weight,” he said.\n\nInvestigators said they are hoping to receive more footage of the person of interest from the public, as they speculate that he may have walked around the area surrounding Brown University as much as a week prior to the shooting.\n\n“We also know in this profession that many criminals will pace out an area weeks and days prior,” Perez explained.\n\nPolice share map of Brown University shooting person of interest’s movements\n\nBrown University shooting investigation spills over into Massachusetts\n\nInvestigators release video timeline of person of interest in Brown campus shooting’s movements\n\nBrown University shooting victim remembered for having a heart ‘as large as the sun’\n\nPolice now trying to ID person ‘in proximity of’ Brown University shooting person of interest",

    "fullText": "Two years after the Supreme Court effectively ended race-conscious college admissions nationwide, Johns Hopkins University has seen a significant change in the racial makeup of its freshman class, according to newly released enrollment data.\n\nSince 2023, the number of Asian first-year undergraduate students, as measured by federal reporting standards, has risen nearly 20 percentage points, to 45.1% from 25.6%. Black first-year student representation, meanwhile, has been cut in half, dropping to 4% from 9.8%, as has the Hispanic student population, which fell to 10.1% this year from 20.8% two years ago. White freshman enrollment remained relatively flat, at 21% in 2025, compared with 19.3% in 2023. Those self-reporting as white fell more sharply to 30.9% from 39.1%.\n\nThe data offer a clear, local snapshot of how elite universities may be changing in the wake of the 2023 ruling, which prohibited schools from considering race in admissions. While universities across the country warned the decision could reduce racial diversity, Johns Hopkins’ numbers show an especially stark shift.\n\n“Since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in [Students for Fair Admissions] v Harvard, we have been navigating an evolving legal and regulatory environment,” said university spokesman J.B. Bird in an email to the Baltimore Sun. “We continue to work on opening our doors as wide as possible to students from all backgrounds and perspectives.”\n\nThe research university has seen some success in its efforts to diversify by income level, regardless of race. The 2025 freshman class has the highest-ever number of Pell grant recipients, at 24.1%, up slightly from 23.8% last year and 21.6% the year before. First-generation college student admission remained flat from last year at 20.3% percent, but up from 19.4% in 2023. Both Pell grant recipients and first-generation college students had risen steadily since 2010.\n\nThe university’s new Tuition Promise program could also increase diversity in the coming years, said Amelia, a second-year graduate student who declined to give her last name.\n\nThe program, which begins next year, with January admissions, offers a free education to students whose families earn less than $200,000, and includes living expenses for those making less than $100,000.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision is already changing higher education in more ways than student body demographics can reveal, said Bryan Cook higher education policy director of the nonpartisan Urban Institute think tank. Johns Hopkins is not unique, though the court’s decision more strongly impacted private, elite college and universities that had been trying to recruit more diverse student bodies, Cook said. Schools like community colleges that accept all applications, and state schools that rely primarily on test scores for admissions, would not be affected, he said.\n\nA lot of institutions are having to make significant changes in their policies,” Cook said. “In many cases, this is already changing the demographics of what campuses look like.”\n\nIt’s difficult to determine the whole story, he said, admissions data only shows part of what is happening.\n\n“We know nothing about the demographics of their applicant pool and how that might line up with admissions,” Cook explained. “We don’t know what’s happening universally across all schools.”\n\nThe Urban Institute reached out to universities to request applicant data to improve their understanding, publishing their findings in July of 2025.\n\n“Early analysis from 18 institutions suggests that Black students’ share of the applicant pool increased more between 2023 and 2024 than in any of the prior five years,” the report states, “but their share of the admitted student pool held constant or even decreased. Furthermore, an increasing number of applicants have chosen not to disclose their race or ethnicity.”\n\nAmong elite universities, those admitting less than half of their applicants, Black student admissions fell to 5.9% in 2024 from 6.6% in 2023, while Black admissions at less selective schools remained level.\n\nMost Americans support fair admissions, said Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, the organization that brought the lawsuit against Harvard, resulting in the Supreme Court decision.\n\n“Credible polling from across the political spectrum indicates that Americans agree that a student’s race or ethnicity should not be considered as a factor in whether that student is accepted or rejected at any university,” Blum said.\n\nHopkins student Aaden, who asked to only be identified by his first name.\n\n“I believe it is important to have a diverse student body,” said Aaden, a third-year chemistry student, “although I think if we were picking people because of their race, it’s not fair to Asian and white students. People with lower grades might be picked because of their race.”\n\nAaden lives in Florida, where his parents immigrated from the Caribbean. He said he hasn’t experienced racism on campus but understands how new Black and Hispanic students might feel more isolated this year.\n\nMaria Laskaris, a college counselor from TopTier Admissions, helps students prepare for and get into schools best suited for their needs, beginning younger than high school age. She agreed that the Supreme Court ruling affects primarily highly selective private institutions, but said the changes would not necessarily change how she advises minority student clients.\n\n“I would make sure that any student I advise is aware of the landscape in which they are applying to college and various policies of the colleges they’re interested in,” she said. “It’s about how you set yourself apart. What do you bring to the table that makes you stand out from other applicants?”\n\nTricia Bishop contributed to this report.\n\nHave a news tip?

    "description": "Professor Gene Sharp of Southeastern Massachusetts University has given several years of study to the possibilities of deterrence and resistance by",
    "fullText": "Professor Gene Sharp of Southeastern Massachusetts University has given several years of study to the possibilities of deterrence and resistance by civilians as a conceivable alternative, or partial alternative, to the traditional, purely military concepts of national defense that have so long prevailed and continue to prevail in European countries. He has restricted the range of applicability of his researches and reflections to Europe, and has directed them, within those limits, primarily to the neutral countries such as Austria and Finland. But his study is intended to apply, at least hypothetically, to such other countries, now members of one or the other of the great nuclear alliances, as might in some distant future succeed in detaching themselves from the alliance in question and thus find themselves compelled to devise an independent defense policy that makes sense with regard to the military and political realities of the present day. The question addressed in this book is essentially this: Where is the peace-loving, nonaggressive, and nonaligned country to find the maximum security against outside interference and domination in a world where war itself, and therefore the traditional preparations for war, have lost so much of their rationale as instruments of national policy?\n\nThe answer in the NATO establishment (and perhaps also, although with diminished conviction and enthusiasm, in the Soviet one, too) would be: in the nuclear deterrent, of course. Either, one would say, you have your own nuclear arsenal, or you ally yourself with someone else who has one.\n\nMr. Sharp challenges (quite correctly in the opinion of this reviewer) the validity of this supposed alternative. Not only is the nuclear deterrent by its very nature dangerously unstable but it is not really a means of defense. In the concept of nuclear deterrence, Mr. Sharp notes, “the capacity to defend in order to deter has been replaced by the capability to destroy massively without the ability to defend.” Beyond this there is, for any country wishing to go the nuclear road, the necessity of choosing between the development of a nuclear arsenal of one’s own, at vast expense and in defiance of the international effort to restrict proliferation, and the acceptance of an alliance with some existing nuclear power—a relationship bound, as experience has shown, to raise the unanswerable question about whose interests, those of the protector or those of the nominally protected, are eventually to prevail in a moment of crisis so brief as to be responsive only to the impulses of the computer.\n\nFinally, as Mr. Sharp also points out, to create a nuclear arsenal or to accept someone else’s missiles on one’s own territory is to increase immensely, from a point of near zero to a very high level, the danger that in any sort of a nuclear conflict one’s own country will become a likely target. Mr. Sharp could even have strengthened his case, in this respect, by pointing out that the Soviet leaders have repeatedly and specifically affirmed that they would never use nuclear weapons against any country that did not itself deploy them or permit them to be deployed on its own territory—an assurance that deserves greater credence than it has generally received, not only because there would be no reason to put out such a statement exclusively to deceive, but also because, given the general irrationality of the nuclear weapon, that policy in question makes perfectly good sense.\n\nThus for a nonnuclear country determined to pursue an independent policy but required to live under the shadow of the nuclear competition of the two super-powers, the nuclear option is not a hopeful one. But neither, for that matter, is an exclusive reliance on the traditional concepts of defense with “conventional” weapons. In an age of long-range striking power by aircraft, by missiles, even by long-range artillery, the idea of defense at the frontier has lost its reality. Beyond that, such is now the destructive power of even nonnuclear weapons that a war fought with them, particularly a defensive war presumably conducted largely on one’s own territory, promises nothing but a degree of devastation that makes a mockery of the very idea of military victory. Here we simply get back to the fact that war, generally, as among the industrially advanced and technologically sophisticated countries, can no longer serve any useful purpose—not even that of a defense.\n\nIt did not, actually, take the post–World War II advances in weapons technology to establish this fact. It is inescapably clear that in the two great European wars of this century there were, in reality, no victors. These were, in effect, simply senseless orgies of destruction. The damages they inflicted, on the nominal victor and the defeated alike, were far greater and more insidious than people were even aware of at the time, reaching as they did into the spiritual and genetic as well as the purely military and physical realms. It is idle for the independent European country of this day to suppose that by entering into a new and even more horrible round of such carnage it could protect anything worth protecting.\n\nThese two supposed alternatives for an independent defense on the part of the unaligned Continental country are therefore, when looked at carefully, no alternatives at all. It is not surprising, in these circumstances, that people’s minds should turn to the question whether there might not be some means of defense that would at least hold out hope of avoiding the sheer physical disasters that both of these supposed alternatives invite. It is this necessity that has led to Professor Sharp’s inquiry into the possibilities and limitations of civilian-based defense; and it would be unfair to judge it in any way other than in relation to the unpromising nature of these two, and only, visible alternatives. It is worth bearing in mind, as one reads his book, that however one assesses the possibilities of civilian-based defense, the nature of the available alternatives is such that it would not take much to be preferable to them.\n\nMr. Sharp’s study addresses itself, as its subtitle (The Potential of Civilian-based Deterrence and Defence) implies, both to deterrence and to resistance if deterrence fails. The two are of course closely connected; but each requires separate treatment, and receives it.\n\nDeterrence, in this instance, is of particular importance. For the study starts, as so much conventional military thinking fails to do, from the assumption that the presumptive attacker is motivated not just by a blind urge to destroy for destruction’s sake but rather by a wholly rational desire to gain domination over the political life of the victim country and to use that domination to his own advantage. And here, of course, is where the reactions of the civilian population—its will to resist and the preparation it has been given for doing so—come in. To deny this is to fly in the face of the historical evidence. For if we consider the failure of other powers to attack Switzerland during the two world wars, the failure of the Soviet Union to occupy Finland in the wake of their conflicts during World War II, and the similar abstention by Moscow from attacking Yugoslavia after that country’s break with the Soviet Union in 1948, we can see that calculations relating to the respective country’s presumptive powers of internal resistance, while certainly not the only considerations that played a part, occupied a prominent place among those that determined the final decision.\n\nThe successful imposition of foreign domination over a given country requires the ability of the dominating power to find, from among the population of that country, a faction either so inspired ideologically or so successfully cowed as to serve as a puppet government. It then requires that this faction should have the capacity to recruit the requisite indigenous bureaucracy, and to compel the population to accept and respect its authority. But whether these conditions can or cannot be met is something that will be importantly affected by the extent and effectiveness of the training, indoctrination, and general preparation for resistance that the population has received in advance of the event. This, in turn, is something the potential aggressor is likely to have a fair idea of before he takes the decision whether or not to attack; and his decision is bound to be affected by his assessment of its importance.\n\nAs for resistance itself if deterrence fails, there are a great many possible forms of this (Mr. Sharp has himself identified nearly two hundred of them). Some of these may be overt and largely spontaneous; others require the most highly centralized leadership, training, and direction. Some are designed to have military effect; others are directed solely to civilian administration. Some require mass participation; others can be conducted only conspiratorially, by carefully selected and highly trained individuals. The mix to be chosen in any given instance must depend on the nature of the country in question and the peculiarities of the prevailing situation. To select among these, and to conduct careful advance planning and preparation for their implementation, is a function that lies at the heart of civilian-based defense as Mr. Sharp sees it; and it is precisely in this respect that his reflections are most importantly innovative.\n\nFor seldom, if ever, in the contests of the past, has there been any such thing as this careful advance preparation. The resistance movements that made themselves felt during the Second World War were almost without exception ones that had to be improvised under conditions of extreme danger and difficulty—under the eyes and guns, that is, of the occupier. There can be no doubt that had they had the sort of advance preparation this study envisages, their effectiveness would have been increased several times over. Lines of command would have been known; effective channels of communication would have existed; there would have been adequate caches of weapons and supplies; ordinary citizens would have had guidance and instruction as to how to behave; given types of action would have been rehearsed and prepared.\n\nSkeptics may point to the long endurance of the Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe as evidence of the hopelessness of civilian resistance to domination by a strong outside power. But again, what they will be citing as an example is not at all what Mr. Sharp has in mind. There was, in those instances, no possibility whatsoever for advance preparation—quite the contrary. What the Soviet authorities found before them, as their armies overran this great region, was a territory where all semblance of real indigenous authority had already been swept away by the preceding Nazi-German occupation. It is often forgotten that it was not the Russians but the Nazis who destroyed the prewar status quo in that part of the world, and with it all social and political stability. What the Russians found there was in fact a territory ideally prepared to receive just the sort of domination they were desirous of establishing—a situation, in short, just the opposite of the one Mr. Sharp has in mind when he examines the possibilities of a resistance well prepared in advance by an indigenous government enjoying the confidence of the people. For this concept, there are, in fact, few examples. It is a modern concept, addressed to the unprecedented conditions of this modern age.\n\nI am not in total agreement with all of Mr. Sharp’s argument. There are places where the emphasis, in my view, could have been usefully shifted. I would have placed more weight on highly centralized, clandestine direction, less on spontaneous mass action. I am not sure that the nature of civilian defense planning should be so widely publicized as the author of the book would seem to envisage. I am less sanguine than he is about the possibilities for demoralizing the armed forces of an intruder. But these are minor differences, particularly if we take into account the limitations Mr. Sharp has placed on his own conclusions.\n\nThere is, of course, in this endangered world, no such thing as absolute defense for anyone; and Mr. Sharp advances no claim that a civilian-based system would provide this. He does not even claim that civilian-based defense could usefully constitute the only component of an adequate defense policy. He recognizes that it might have to be combined, at one stage or another, with the actions of certain types of regular military forces. He does not even depict his own conclusions as definitive. His plea is only that civilian-based defense has a legitimate place among the options open to the sort of country he is talking about; that this place is plainly larger than has been generally supposed; and that its possibilities ought to be more carefully studied and considered than they have been in the past. His primary purpose in writing the book was, he says, “to make civilian-based deterrence and defense a thinkable policy which is recognized as meriting further research, policy studies, and an evaluation.” And for this, he makes a reasonably good case.\n\nBut he must not expect, just for this reason, that the effort to win understanding for his views will be easy going. It goes against the grain of all established strategic thinking. The professional military establishments will brush it off with incredulity, if not with contempt. It will arouse in many circles the same skepticism, and perhaps the same derision, that this reviewer brought down upon himself when he had the temerity to advance somewhat similar ideas in a widely publicized radio lecture delivered over the facilities of the BBC many years ago.\n\nBut the view advanced in this book deserves consideration, if only because of the bankruptcy of all the visible alternatives to it. It might just be that in a world where the devices of long-range military destruction have proliferated beyond all reason, the greatest security any country can hope to have, imperfect as it is, will be found to lie primarily in its confidence in itself, in its readiness to leave other people alone and to go its own way, it its willingness to accept the sort of social discipline that a civilian-based defense implies—in a stance, in other words, that offers minimal incentive to foreign military intrusion but promises to make things difficult, painful, and unprofitable for any power that decides, nevertheless, to intrude. Such principles may not be everywhere applicable. Nowhere may they be the complete answer to the problems at hand. But beggars, in this world of destructive power unlimited, cannot always be choosers. And Mr. Sharp’s approach, certainly more humane and in a small way more hopeful than many others, deserves at least to be given a hearing.\n\nTo see things in this way will require, however, a rather basic change in the view hundreds of millions of people have been taught to take of the sources of national security and of the means by which it may be usefully promoted. The new view would be one that looks primarily inward—to the quality of the respective society, to the character of its institutions, to its social discipline and civic morale, rather than outward to the effectiveness of its armed forces—for the true sources of its strength and its security. It suggests, in Mr. Sharp’s words, “the direct defense of society as such—its principles, free institutions, and liberties—rather than a futile attempt to defend territory as an indirect means to defend the society.” It raises, in fact, the question whether any society can be stronger in relation to others than it is to itself.\n\nWhat is implied here is no less than a change in political philosophy. For it taps, as Mr. Sharp says in his final passages, “a crucial insight into the nature of power”—namely, that\n\nall political power is rooted in and continually dependent upon the co-operation and obedience of the subjects and institutions of the society…. It is indeed possible for whole societies to apply that insight…against internal and foreign aggressors, and to triumph…. With effort, risks, and costs, it is possible for Europeans—and all peoples—to make themselves politically indigestible to would-be tyrants. The process has already begun.\n\nPerhaps those words overstate the case; but if so, not greatly. One ends the reading of the book wondering whether, if this change in political philosophy were to take place, it might not have wider effects than just those that relate to the concepts of national security—whether many other things might not also change, and, in the main, usefully so.\n\nGeorge F. Kennan (1904–2005) was an American diplomat, political scientist and historian. He is best known for his role in shaping US foreign policy during the Cold War and, in particular, for the doctrine of containment. Kennan was Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and served as Ambassador to the USSR in 1952 and as Ambassador to Yugoslavia from 1961 to 1963. His books include At a Century’s Ending and An American Family.",

    "fullText": "The University of Michigan is not firing the woman involved in the \"inappropriate\" relationship with Sherrone Moore.\n\nMoore, the program's football coach, was fired for having an \"inappropriate\" relationship with a female staff member. He was later arrested on criminal trespassing and stalking charges, after learning of his firing. Michigan said in a statement last Wednesday night, December 10, that Moore was being fired immediately.\n\n“When the findings of a university investigation into Coach Moore’s behavior were presented on Wednesday, we immediately terminated his employment,” Grasso wrote in a letter to the university,\" the school's president said.\n\n“There is absolutely no tolerance for this conduct at the University of Michigan. None.”\n\nBut while Moore was fired for having the \"inappropriate\" relationship with the staff member, the woman - who also hid the relationship from the school for months, if not longer - is not being fired.\n\nThe University of Michigan announced that the woman is still employed by the university.\n\nThe school's policy does not apply to her. It only applied to Moore, since he was the person in power, according to USA TODAY.\n\n“Recognizing that Intimate Relationships exist or may develop in the workplace that are not initiated by a Supervisor and are free from coercion and abuse of power, immediate disclosure of the relationship by the Supervisor is required,” the policy states. “Failure of the Supervisor to disclose an Intimate Relationship is a serious offense and cause for discipline, up to and including dismissal from employment.”\n\nThe woman was technically encouraged to share news of the relationship with the school, though she wasn't required to do so.\n\n“Although encouraged, Supervisees have no obligation to disclose,” the policy states.\n\nThe school recognizes that the person in the relationship who has more power at the school has the opportunity to abuse said power. The person without it has less.\n\n“Intimate Relationships initiated by a Supervisor are at high risk of being unwelcomed and experienced by the Supervisee as harassment,” the policy states. “Supervisors are therefore responsible for understanding how their statements and conduct may reasonably be interpreted by persons who do not share their same level of power.”\n\nThe school clearly outlines its rules in Policy No. 201.97.\n\nIt states that a supervisor may not “implicitly or explicitly, initiate or attempt to initiate an intimate relationship with a supervisee.”\n\nSo it was Moore, who has been married for 10 years with three children, that was the one at fault.",

    "title": "New Quantum Antenna Reveals a Hidden Terahertz World",
    "description": "Researchers at the University of Warsaw have unveiled a breakthrough method for detecting and precisely calibrating terahertz frequency combs using a quantum antenna made from Rydberg atoms. By combining atomic electrometry with a powerful terahertz-to-light conversion technique, they achieved the first measurement of a single terahertz comb tooth—something previously impossible due to the limits of electronics and optical tools.",
    "fullText": "A research team from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw has introduced a new way to measure hard-to-detect terahertz signals using a \"quantum antenna.\" In their work, the scientists applied an innovative radio wave detection setup based on Rydberg atoms that not only senses terahertz radiation, but also accurately calibrates a so-called frequency comb in this part of the spectrum. Until recently, the terahertz range was considered a blank area in the electromagnetic spectrum, and the method reported in the journal Optica opens the door to extremely sensitive spectroscopy and a new class of room-temperature quantum sensors.\n\nTerahertz (THz) radiation, being part of the electromagnetic spectrum, lies at the boundary of electronics and optics, positioned between microwaves (used, for example, in Wi-Fi) and infrared. Although it holds immense potential for applications that include inspecting packages without harmful X-rays, superspeed 6G communication, and spectroscopy and imaging of organic compounds, turning this potential into precise and sensitive measurements has been technically very difficult. In the past few years, scientists have made major strides in both generating and detecting terahertz radiation, yet until now they had not been able to measure a frequency comb in this region with the required precision.\n\nFrequency combs as ultra-precise electromagnetic rulers\n\nWhy is this so important? Frequency combs, which earned a Nobel Prize in 2005, can be imagined as an incredibly accurate ruler made not from a solid material, but from light or radio waves. Instead of millimeter markings, there is a sequence of evenly spaced lines (\"teeth\") at strictly defined frequencies. This \"electromagnetic ruler\" lets physicists determine the frequency of an unknown signal with extraordinary accuracy simply by seeing which \"tooth\" it matches. Because of this, frequency combs act as reference standards that can be used to calibrate and stabilize many types of instruments over a wide range of frequencies. Depending on where in the electromagnetic spectrum this ruler sits, scientists talk about optical, radio, or terahertz frequency combs.\n\nTerahertz frequency combs are particularly attractive because they can support calibration and highly accurate measurements in a band where the oscillation frequencies are higher than typical radio waves but lower than optical waves (light). However, such combs are notoriously difficult to measure with high precision, since their oscillations are too rapid for conventional electronics and cannot be directly captured with standard optical methods. Researchers have been able to determine the spacing between the comb \"teeth\" and to measure the total power spread across the spectrum, but determining how much power belongs to a single tooth has remained a major challenge.\n\nRydberg atoms turned into quantum antennas\n\nThe scientists from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw have now overcome this obstacle and, for the first time, measured the signal emitted by a single terahertz comb tooth. To achieve this, they employed a gas of rubidium atoms prepared in a Rydberg state. A Rydberg atom is defined as having a single electron excited to a very high orbit by being illuminated with precisely tuned lasers. This \"swollen\" atom acts as a quantum antenna that is extremely sensitive to external electric fields. In addition, by using tunable lasers, the detector can be adjusted to respond to one specific frequency within such a field, across a range that extends up to terahertz waves.\n\nTraditionally, in Rydberg electrometry, the phenomenon of Autler-Townes splitting is used to measure the electric field. Its huge advantage is that the measurement result depends only on fundamental atomic constants, providing an absolutely calibrated readout. Unlike classical antennas, which require laborious calibration in specialized radio laboratories, the atomic-based system is, in a sense, a standard unto itself. Moreover, thanks to the richness of energy states in the atom, such a sensor can be tuned almost continuously over an enormous range, from a direct current (DC) signal up to the aforementioned terahertz.\n\nHybrid terahertz to light conversion for extreme sensitivity\n\nHowever, this method has a limitation: on its own, it is not sensitive enough to record very weak terahertz signals. To remedy this, the research team additionally applied a radio wave-to-light conversion technique invented at the University of Warsaw and adapted it to the needs of terahertz radiation. In this process, the weak terahertz signal is converted into optical photons, which can then be detected with immense sensitivity using single-photon counters. This hybrid approach is the key to success: it combines the extreme sensitivity of photon detection with the ability to \"recover\" the calibration capabilities of the Autler-Townes method even for the weakest signals.\n\nThe sensor based on Rydberg atoms possesses all the features needed to perform precise frequency comb calibration: it can be tuned to a single tooth of the comb, and then retuned to the next, and the next. The scientists managed to observe several dozen teeth in a very wide frequency range this way. Additionally, thanks to the knowledge of the fundamental properties of atoms, the comb was directly calibrated, precisely determining its intensity.\n\nNew path for terahertz metrology and future technologies\n\nThe results obtained by the physicists from the University of Warsaw Wiktor Krokosz, Jan Nowosielski, Bartosz Kasza, Sebastian Borówka, Mateusz Mazelanik, Wojciech Wasilewski, and Michał Parniak represent much more than the development of another sensitive detector. Their work lays the groundwork for a new area of metrology. With the help of Rydberg atoms, the transformative uses of optical frequency combs can now be extended into the previously difficult terahertz region. Importantly, unlike many quantum technologies that require extremely low temperatures, this system functions at room temperature, which greatly lowers costs and makes future commercialization more realistic. This creates an opportunity to build reference measurement standards for the coming generation of terahertz technologies.\n\nThe project \"Quantum Optical Technologies\" (FENG.02.01-IP.05-0017/23) is implemented as part of Measure 2.1 International Research Agendas of the Foundation for Polish Science, co-financed by the European Union from Priority 2 of the European Funds for Modern Economy Programme 2021-2027 (FENG). The research is also one of the results of the SONATA17 and PRELUDIUM23 projects funded by the National Science Centre.)\n\nMaterials provided by University of Warsaw, Faculty of Physics.

    "description": "Authorities on Monday had renewed a manhunt for the gunman who killed two students and injured seven more at",
    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Authorities on Monday had renewed a manhunt for the gunman who killed two students and injured seven more at Brown University over the weekend, after releasing a man who had been held on Sunday as ​a \"person of interest\" in the shooting.\n\nThough officials said late on Sunday they were resuming the search for a suspect, they said there were no ‌credible threats to the community and that they would not reimpose a shelter-in-place order for the campus and the surrounding area that had been lifted earlier.\n\nPolice have released surveillance footage showing the possible shooter ‌dressed in black walking near the building where the attack took place, though his face is not visible.\n\nThe gunman fled after shooting students in a classroom in Brown's Barus & Holley engineering and physics building, where outer doors had been left unlocked while exams were taking place, according to police.\n\nAt a press conference late on Sunday, officials said there had been enough evidence to justify taking into custody the unnamed person of interest, a man in his 20s.\n\nBut Providence Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters the investigation was going in a \"different direction,\" without ⁠offering more detail. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said ‌investigators had determined there was \"no basis to believe that he's a person of interest, so... he's being released.\"\n\nThe mass shooting shook the campus at Brown, one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the United States. The Ivy League school, which has nearly ‍11,000 undergraduate and graduate students, canceled exams and classes for the rest of the year, and the campus was quiet on Sunday as a light snowfall blanketed the city.\n\nThe two students killed were Ella Cook, a sophomore from Mountain Brook, Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, according to statements from various officials.\n\nCook was vice president of the ​school's College Republicans and a \"leading Republican voice at Brown,\" according to an X post from the New York Republicans Club. Her LinkedIn profile included jobs as an ‌ice cream server at a Mountain Brook creamery and a program assistant in New York.\n\n\"Wesley and I join the Mountain Brook community and all of Alabama in mourning the heartbreaking loss of one of our own, Ella Cook, who was senselessly killed over the weekend on Brown University's campus,\" U.S. Senator Katie Britt of Alabama wrote in a statement with her husband, Wesley.\n\nUmurzokov, an aspiring neurosurgeon, was \"the most kind-hearted person,\" according to a GoFundMe campaign set up by his family.\n\n\"He always lent a helping hand to anyone in need without hesitation, and was the most kind-hearted person our family knew,\" the family wrote. \"Our family is incredibly devastated by this loss.\"\n\nHe graduated from Midlothian ⁠High School in Virginia this spring, according to the Washington Post. In a statement, the U.S. ​ambassador to Uzbekistan, Jonathan Henick, mourned \"the loss of his bright future.\"\n\nRef Bari, 22, ​a graduate student at Brown, said he was inside the Barus & Holley building when he heard a series of loud popping sounds that appeared to be gunfire.\n\nBari ran out of the building and asked another student running in the street if he could hide with her ‍and her friends and she agreed. They ⁠returned to her basement apartment and hid in the bathroom.\n\n\"She trusted me,\" he said. \"The only connection between us is we're both students at Brown but beyond that, we don't know each other.\"\n\nTeaching assistant Joseph Oduro, 21, told CNN he was in a classroom that was attacked.\n\n\"The first couple of gunshots went ⁠straight to the chalkboard right where I was standing,\" Oduro said. \"Who knows, if I didn't duck, maybe I'm not here today.\"\n\nA student next to him took two bullets to the leg and was due ‌to undergo surgery on Sunday, he said.",

    "fullText": "One of the students killed in the mass shooting at Brown University is Ella Cook, who was a parishioner at the Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama, the church announced during its Sunday, Dec. 14, service.\n\n\"Many of you heard about the tragedy ... And sadly, tragically, one of those people is one of our parishioners,\" Rev. Craig Smalley said in livestreamed remarks.\n\nSmalley described Cook as a \"bright light\" who was engaged in the church and the broader community, and \"incredibly grounded and generous and faithful.\"\n\nCook's LinkedIn profile indicates that she began attending Brown in 2024.\n\nShe was vice president of the Brown Republicans, according to a social media post from Alex Shieh, who left the school earlier this year amid a furor over his DOGE-inspired \"bloat @ Brown\" campaign.\n\n\"Being a conservative at Brown isn't always the easiest, but Ella was never afraid to share her beliefs on an overwhelmingly liberal campus and support others in doing so,\" Shieh wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"Last spring, while I was under a disciplinary investigation for reporting on Brown's administration for the conservative student paper, almost nobody wanted to be associated with me,\" he added. \"Ella was one of the few who were willing to stand with me in public and help hand out newspapers in front of the dining hall.\"\n\nAlabama U.S. Sen. Katie Britt expressed her condolences to the family of Ella Cook, calling the student’s death “heartbreaking” and “senseless,\" according to reporting from the Montgomery Advertiser.\n\nIn a statement, Britt said she and her husband, Wesley, “joined the Mountain Brook community and all of Alabama in mourning the heartbreaking loss of one of our own, Ella Cook, who was senselessly killed over the weekend on Brown University’s campus.”\n\nShe offered comfort to those who knew Cook, noting that her life was “taken far too soon” and expressing gratitude to law enforcement officials working on the investigation. Britt also asked that Ella’s loved ones and community be kept in prayers during this difficult time.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Dec. 14, WRAL News and the News & Observer, in Raleigh, North Carolina, reported that Kendall Turner, a Brown freshman, is among the injured students.\n\nTurner is an alumnus of Durham Academy in Durham, North Carolina, said an email sent to the school community, according to reports from both outlets.\n\nThe email said that Turner underwent surgery and is now resting in critical but stable condition. Her parents arrived in Providence on Saturday night.\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Brown University student killed in mass shooting ID'd as Ella Cook",
