    "description": "I thought I would enjoy attending a private university in Milan. I quickly learned I had made the wrong choice.",
    "fullText": "I crossed the street near where I was living in Milan on the verge of tears. I had had enough of feeling sad, lonely, and hopeless.\n\nThat surely wasn't how I expected to feel in my first year of university.\n\nThe previous spring, I had thought about which undergraduate degree I wanted to pursue for months, reading about courses, tuition, and life in a new place. Since I loved writing and dreamed of becoming a journalist, studying communication seemed like the best bet. I chose to pursue a degree at a private university in Milan because the classes seemed fascinating and useful, and the idea of living in Milan was thrilling.\n\nUnfortunately, I soon realized I had made the wrong choice.\n\nThe majority of the courses I was taking were engaging, but we occasionally experienced last-minute schedule changes and disorganized lecturers, and that didn't sit right with me.\n\nMore importantly, I began to feel guilty about the expenses my parents were covering for me. They assured me they could afford it and that my education was worthwhile to them; nonetheless, the tuition and rent were expensive. And, if I wasn't loving it, should they be spending so much?\n\nLiving in Milan was way more exciting in my dreams than it was in reality. While this metropolis had a lot to offer, like cultural exhibitions, sports events, and a lively nightlife, it was also chaotic and hectic. I often felt agitated and restless.\n\nIn my first months there, my sleep was severely affected. It was extremely challenging to find accommodation near the university, and I ended up in a small apartment with a shared bedroom. I struggled to adapt to that living situation and to the noisy neighborhood we lived in.\n\nThe following summer, I applied to the University of Urbino. The living costs and slower rhythms of Urbino, a 15,000-inhabitant town located a short distance from where I grew up in San Marino, were way more appealing to me.\n\nThere, I could attend classes just three days a week, so finding an accommodation wasn't an urgent matter anymore. It was manageable to go back and forth by car from my family home in the first month.\n\nAfter that period, I rented a single room with a stunning view, at a walkable distance from my lecture halls. The morning walk in Urbino's historical center to class became a pleasurable part of my day.\n\nI felt relieved because the public university tuition and accommodation in Urbino were much cheaper than what I was paying in Milan. Given the flexibility of my new arrangement and the saved money, I signed up for a fitness course with training branches in Urbino and San Marino, as well as a mindfulness program in Rimini. I was brighter and more serene.\n\nUnfortunately, this period in Urbino didn't last long, because COVID-19 hit and universities implemented online lessons, and I eventually ended up moving back home.\n\nLooking back, those few months in Urbino were the best period of my early 20s, and I'm glad I was courageous enough to know that something wasn't right and that I could do something about it, and that's a lesson that still sticks with me today.",

    "title": "Study Shows Alzheimer's Disease Can Be Reversed in Animal Models",
    "description": "Researchers from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland VA showed restoring the brain’s energy balance led to both pathological and functional recovery.",
    "fullText": "Dr. Andrew Pieper, senior author of the study.\n\nCLEVELAND – For over a century, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been considered irreversible. Consequently, research has focused on disease prevention or slowing, rather than recovery. Despite billions of dollars spent on decades of research, there has never been a clinical trial of a drug for AD with an outcome goal of reversing disease and recovering function.\n\nNow, a research team from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center has challenged this long-held dogma in the field. They tested whether brains already badly afflicted with advanced AD could recover.\n\nThe study, led by Kalyani Chaubey, PhD, from the Pieper Laboratory, published today in Cell Reports Medicine. Through studying diverse preclinical mouse models and human AD brains, the team showed that the brain’s failure to maintain normal levels of a central cellular energy molecule, NAD+, is a major driver of AD, and that maintaining proper NAD+ balance can prevent and even reverse the disease.\n\nNAD+ levels decline naturally across the body, including the brain, as people age. Without proper NAD+ balance, cells eventually become unable to execute critical processes required for proper functioning and survival. In this study, the team showed that the decline in NAD+ is even more severe in the brains of people with AD, and that this also occurs in mouse models of the disease.\n\nWhile AD is a uniquely human condition, it can be studied in the laboratory with mice that have been engineered to express genetic mutations that cause AD in people. The researchers used two of these models. One line of mice carried multiple human mutations in amyloid processing, and the other mouse line carried a human mutation in the tau protein. Amyloid and tau pathology are two of the major early events in AD, and both lines of mice develop brain pathology resembling AD, including blood-brain barrier deterioration, axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, reduced synaptic transmission, and widespread accumulation of oxidative damage. These mice also develop severe cognitive impairments that resemble what is seen in people with AD.\n\nAfter finding that NAD+ levels in the brain declined precipitously in both human and mouse AD, the research team tested whether preventing the loss of brain NAD+ balance before disease onset, or restoring brain NAD+ balance after significant disease progression, could prevent or reverse AD, respectively. The study was based on their previous work, published in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA, showing that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance achieved pathological and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury. They restored NAD+ balance by administering a now well-characterized pharmacologic agent known as P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper lab.\n\nRemarkably, not only did preserving NAD+ balance protect mice from developing AD, but delayed treatment in mice with advanced disease also enabled the brain to fix the major pathological events caused by the genetic mutations. Moreover, both lines of mice fully recovered cognitive function. This was accompanied by normalized blood levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker of AD in people, providing confirmation of disease reversal and highlighting a potential biomarker for future clinical trials.\n\n“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH. “Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain’s NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer’s.”\n\nDr. Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. He serves as Psychiatrist and Investigator in the Louis Stokes VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC).\n\nThe results prompt a paradigm shift in how researchers, clinicians, and patients can think about treating AD in the future. “The key takeaway is a message of hope – the effects of Alzheimer's disease may not be inevitably permanent,” said Dr. Pieper. “The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.”\n\nDr. Chaubey further explained, “Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD.”\n\nDr. Pieper emphasized that currently available over the counter NAD+-precursors have been shown in animal models to raise cellular NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer The approach in this study, however, uses a pharmacologic agent (P7C3-A20) that enables cells to maintain their proper balance of NAD+ under conditions of otherwise overwhelming stress, without elevating NAD+ to supraphysiologic levels.\n\n“This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,” said Dr. Pieper.\n\nThis work also encourages new research into complementary approaches and eventual testing in patients, and the technology is being commercialized by Cleveland-based company Glengary Brain Health, co-founded by Dr. Pieper.\n\n“This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,” Dr. Pieper explained. “Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer's reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.”\n\nChaubey, Kalyani et al. “Pharmacologic reversal of Alzheimer’s disease in mice reveals potential therapeutic nodes in human brain.” Cell Reports Medicine. DOI: 10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102535\n\nTags:\r\n Alzheimer's Disease, Aging",

It is not clear why the judge issued the new guidelines.\n\nActivist Says There Was a Safe Haven Baby Box 10 Minutes From Cheerleader Laken Snelling’s Home\n\nThe infant’s cause of death was ruled inconclusive and “extensive microscopic analyses are essential to determine the cause and manner of death,” according to a report from the Fayette County Coroner’s Office obtained by Us Weekly on September 4.\n\n“I understand the community’s concern and sensitivity surrounding the death of a child,” Fayette County Coroner Gary Ginn said in the report. “We are conducting a thorough and methodical death investigation to ensure all facts are carefully considered.”\n\nAt the time of her arrest, Snelling was a student at the University of Kentucky and a three-year member of the school’s STUNT cheerleading team.\n\nA spokesperson for the school told Us on September 5 that Snelling “is no longer a student at the university and, as a result, is no longer a member of the STUNT team.”",

    "fullText": "LEXINGTON, Neb. (AP) — On a frigid day after Mass at St. Ann’s Catholic Church in rural Nebraska, worshippers shuffled into the basement and sat on folding chairs, their faces barely masking the fear gripping their town.\n\nA pall hung over the room just as it hung over the holiday season in Lexington, Nebraska.\n\n“Suddenly they tell us that there’s no more work. Your world closes in on you,” said Alejandra Gutierrez.\n\nShe and the others work at Tyson Foods' beef plant and are among the 3,200 people who will lose their jobs when Lexington's biggest employer closes the plant next month after more than two decades of operation.\n\nHundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.\n\n“Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University. It will be “close to the poster child for hard times.”\n\nAll told, the job losses are expected to reach 7,000, largely in Lexington and the surrounding counties, according to estimates from University of Nebraska, Lincoln, shared with The Associated Press. Tyson employees alone will lose an estimated $241 million in pay and benefits annually.\n\nTyson says it's closing the plant to “right-size” its beef business after a historically low cattle herd in the U.S. and the company’s expected loss of $600 million on beef production next fiscal year.\n\nThe plant's closure threatens to unravel a Great Plains town where the American Dream was still attainable, where immigrants who didn't speak English and never graduated high school bought homes, raised children in a safe community and sent them to college.\n\nNow, those symbols of economic progress — mortgages and car payments, property taxes and tuition costs — are bills that thousands of Tyson workers won't have an income to pay.\n\nAt St. Ann's church, Gutierrez sat between her daughters and recalled being told of the plant closure just before Thanksgiving while she visited a college campus with her high school senior, Kimberly.\n\n“At that moment, my daughter said she no longer wanted to study,” Gutierrez said. “Because where would we get the money to pay for college?”\n\nA tear slipped down Kimberly's cheek as she looked at her mother and then down at her hands.\n\nIf you threw a dart at a map of the United States, Lexington — called “Lex” by locals — would be just about bullseye.\n\nIt's easy to miss driving down Interstate 80, half hidden by barren hackberry trees, corn fields and pastures of Black Angus cattle, but a driver can spy the plant's hulking industrial buildings pumping steam.\n\nThe plant opened in 1990 and was bought by Tyson 11 years later, attracting thousands of workers and nearly doubling the town's population within a decade.\n\nMany came from Los Angeles, then stricken by recession, including Lizeth Yanes, who initially hated what she called “a little ghost town.\"\n\nBut soon Lexington flourished, with suburbs sprouting among bur oak and American elm trees. The downtown, a strip of cobblestone streets and brick buildings, has a Somali grocer that abuts a Hispanic bakery; locals attend over a dozen churches and several city recreation centers.\n\nTo this day, the plant creates the town's rhythm as workers roll on and off the daily A, B and C shifts and fill restaurants, school pickup lines and the one-screen movie theater showing “Polar Express.”\n\n“It took a long time for me to actually enjoy this little place,” said Yanes. “Now that I enjoy it, now I have to leave.”\n\nThe atmosphere inside the Tyson plant, where workers process as many as 5,000 head of cattle a day, laboring on slaughter floors, cleaning crews or trimming cuts of meat, feels “like a funeral,” she said.\n\n“Tyson was our motherland,\" said plant worker Arab Adan. The Kenyan immigrant sat in his car with his two energetic sons, who asked him a question he has no answer to: “Which state are we gonna go, daddy?”\n\nThe only thing Adan is set on is that his kids finish the school year in Lexington, where school officials say nearly half of students have a parent working for Tyson.\n\nThe school district, where at least 20 languages and dialects are spoken, has higher high school graduation and college attendance rates than the state and national average, and one of Nebraska's biggest marching bands. Residents are proud of the diversity and the tightknit community, where young people return to raise families.\n\nDuring Mass at St. Ann's, parishioners gave the cash in their pockets to a fund for families in financial need, despite knowing they'll be out of work next month. Afterward, Francisco Antonio ran through his future employment options with a sad smile.\n\nAfter the plant closes on Jan. 20, the 52-year-old father of four said he'll stay a few months in Lexington and look for work, though “now there's no future.\" He took off his glasses, paused, apologized and tried to explain his emotions.\n\n“It’s home mostly, not the job,” he said, replacing his glasses with an embarrassed smile.\n\n“We need another opportunity, job, here in Lex,” he said. “Otherwise Lex is gonna disappear.”\n\nThe domino effect could go something like this: If 1,000 families skip town, said economist Hicks — who wouldn't be surprised if it were double that — seats would be left empty in schools, leading to teacher layoffs; there would be far fewer customers in restaurants, shops and other businesses.\n\nMost of the customers at Los Jalapenos, a Mexican restaurant down the street from the plant, are Tyson workers. They fill booths after work and are greeted by owner Armando Martinez’s mustachioed grin and bellow of “Hola, amigo!”\n\nMartinez’s grandson once told his grandfather that when he grows up he wants to work at Tyson. The child's fifth-grade sister recently gathered with classmates to talk about the changes happening with their parents. Some were headed to California, others to Kansas. All were in tears.\n\nIf he can't keep up with bills, the restaurant will close, but “there’s just nowhere we can go,\" said Martinez, who undergoes dialysis for diabetes, has an amputated foot and prays for a miracle: that Tyson will change its mind.\n\nHe knows it's unlikely. Asked by The Associated Press for comment about plans for the site, Tyson said in a statement that it “is currently assessing how we can repurpose the facility within our own production network.” It did not provide details, or say whether it plans to offer support to the community through the plant closure.\n\nMany, including City Manager Joe Pepplitsch, are hoping Tyson puts the plant up for sale and a new company comes in bringing jobs. That isn't a quick fix, requiring time, negotiations, renovations and no guarantee of comparable jobs.\n\n“Tyson owes this community a debt. I think they have a responsibility here to help ease some of the impact,” he said, noting Tyson doesn't pay city taxes due to a deal negotiated decades ago.\n\n‘It’s not easy, at our age, to go back and start over’\n\nNear the plant, at the Dawson County Fairgrounds, Tyson workers recently filled a long hall as state agencies — responding with the urgency of a natural disaster — offered information on retraining, writing a resume, filing for unemployment and avoiding scammers when selling homes.\n\nAttendees' faces were subdued, like listening to a doctor’s prognosis. “Your financial health is going to change,\" they were told. “Don’t ignore the bank, they will not go away.”\n\nMany of the older workers don’t speak English, haven’t graduated high school and aren’t computer savvy. The last application some filled out was decades ago.\n\n“We know only working in meat for Tyson, we don’t have any other experience,” said Adan, the Kenyan immigrant.\n\nBack at St. Ann's, workers echoed that concern.\n\n“They only want young people now,” said Juventino Castro, who's worked at Tyson for a quarter-century. “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the time I have left.”\n\nLupe Ceja said she's saved a little money, but it won’t last long. Luz Alvidrez has a cleaning gig that will sustain her for awhile. Others might return to Mexico for a time. Nobody has a clear plan.\n\n“It won’t be easy,” said Fernando Sanchez, a Tyson worker for 35 years who sat with his wife. “We started here from scratch and it’s time to start from scratch again.\"\n\nTears rolled down his wife's cheeks and he squeezed her hand.",

    "description": "Providence police Maj. David Lapatin explains how investigators grappled with four different leads before a fifth finally led to Claudio Neves Valente.",
    "fullText": "Some of the first Providence police major crimes detectives to set eyes on the scene of the Brown University shooting arrived as tactical police officers escorted survivors from the building on Dec. 13.\n\nThe detectives arrived intermittently in the early minutes of an investigation that would test their skills and consume nearly all of their time over the course of five days.\n\nAt times, some would go without sleep for more than 30 hours, according to the person in charge, Providence police Maj. David Lapatin.\n\nInvestigators from a collection of agencies would grapple with four different leads, some more promising than others, before a fifth lead put them on the path of Claudio Neves Valente, the man who authorities say carried out the shootings at Brown, killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and then took his own life in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire.\n\nThe fifth lead, based in large part on aid from a Brown alumnus and Reddit poster and subsequent investigative accomplishments, was a long way off as the team assembled just after the shooting.\n\nThe leaders of the teams on the scene in those early minutes, including Lapatin, saw the victims, Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, in the auditorium-style classroom. They saw dozens of spent cartridge shells. Backpacks and other paraphernalia were strewn around. Bullets had penetrated some of the seats.\n\nLapatin spoke to a small group of detective supervisors.\n\n\"I just told them, 'Look, we've got to take the chaos out of our heads and just concentrate,'\" he says.\n\n\"They all stepped to it,\" he recalls. \"They're all professionals.\"\n\nInvestigators from the crime scene processing team, the Bureau of Criminal Identification, were on the job. Agents from the many federal agencies were already on their way to join in the manhunt. State police handled emergency calls and some routine calls.\n\nManaging the surviving students safely and appropriately for investigative purposes was one of the tasks at hand. They were removed from the building.\n\n\"We wanted to keep as many as we can in a safe place so we could question them later,\" Lapatin says.\n\nAs the survivors waited to talk to detectives, investigators wanted the group at least separated from other people prior to the interviews. The preference, to separate such witnesses from each other, wasn't possible based on conditions.\n\n\"We didn't have much choice,\" Lapatin said.\n\n\"There was a lot of them, a lot in the beginning,\" he added, saying that there were also a lot of police officers with them as well.\n\nWere investigators worried the killer might be in the group?\n\n\"That was always a thought, but we really didn't think so, because, you know, we had some people saying the suspect went out the door,\" Lapatin says.\n\nOther investigators were already in a room at Brown University where screens showed video from campus surveillance cameras. A clip recorded by a camera drew attention, Lapatin says.\n\n\"And what stood out was this man,\" Lapatin recalls.\n\n\"This man, you know, in dark clothing with the face mask, which at the end turned out to be the suspect,\" he says.\n\nThe man was not holding a gun in the video that was drawing the most attention.\n\n\"It was after the shooting,\" Lapatin said.\n\n\"He was walking,\" he said. \"Everybody else was running.\"\n\nIn time, investigators would come to believe that the gun was hidden.\n\n\"Our belief was that he had the satchel now under his coat, with the gun inside,\" Lapatin says.\n\nLapatin and other detectives set up a command post in a building next door.\n\nCalls flowed in from other law enforcement agencies. Federal personnel from the FBI, ATF and Homeland Security Investigations joined the scene.\n\nProvidence police were \"leading\" the investigation, Lapatin says.\n\n\"That was without question,\" he says.\n\nA lead agency has to be established for organizational reasons, he says.\n\nIt was important to make sure there were no \"wildcat\" investigators and \"that everybody is on the same page.\"\n\nTwo major leads took shape during the first 12 hours of the investigation, Lapatin says.\n\nOne, based on a tip from an \"outside agency,\" involved a person who had applied for a gun permit, Lapatin says.\n\nThe information involved a person staying at the Hampton Inn in Coventry just off Interstate 95. He was detained as a person of interest before dawn early Sunday morning, Dec. 14.\n\nThe investigators saw \"some guns and other things,\" Lapatin says. They needed to look into it further.\n\n\"And that's what they did. They checked him out.\"\n\nThe news that someone had been detained was a relief for Rhode Islanders.\n\nBut not for investigators, according to Lapatin.\n\nAnd when the Coventry lead failed to pan out, investigators were not saddled with a big emotional letdown either, he says.\n\nThey had never let their hopes lift that high in the first place, Lapatin says, adding that their search for other leads had continued without pause.\n\n\"We never skipped a beat,\" he said.\n\nA second tip worthy of investigation had also emerged early Sunday morning, Lapatin says: Multiple people had referred police to a man who lived near the university.\n\nBrown had sent out an email asking anyone who was in the building to contact police. The same man called to tell police he had been in the building the day before the shooting.\n\n\"He had an alibi and he was cleared,\" says Lapatin.\n\n\"We decided we needed to take this back to our home grounds,\" Lapatin says.\n\nThe large suite of offices that houses Providence detectives, as well as the department's new Real Time Crime Center, is on one end of the floor.\n\nIn a separate section at the other end, investigators set up in a room where they could work on the tips that were flowing into the station on a designated phone line that was advertised to the public.\n\nThe Providence police team that processes crime scenes for evidence, led by Lt. Robert Papa, remained at Brown with their counterparts in the FBI.\n\nThe first daylight on Sunday helped.\n\nLapatin says they knew what they would do. They needed to methodically collect and view as much video as possible in the neighborhoods close to the scene and then work outward.\n\n\"It's one of our best chances of solving the case,\" Lapatin said.\n\nHowever, other investigators stayed at the safety complex.\n\n\"We had two rooms filled with people on computers,\" he said. \"That's all they did, sit on the computers all day. And then in the Real Time Crime Center, there was more people on computers. These people sat there for hours and hours and hours and just went through things without moving.\"\n\nMost of them were FBI analysts.\n\nLapatin says he had made contact with Wing Chau, the U.S. Marshal for Rhode Island. Chau added marshals to the massive force of investigators.\n\nAgents from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Homeland Security Investigations were already part of the team.\n\nAt Lapatin's request, Brown police Lt. John Carvalho, also the acting deputy chief of Brown's police department and a former Providence police sergeant, joined the team in place on the third floor.\n\nSome of the special technology from the FBI could help gather information from cellular communications. The bureau also had special tech tools for dealing with video and for quickly checking on criminal history, Lapatin says.\n\nThe ATF personnel contributed skills and capabilities for analyzing firearms and spent ammunition and shells. Some rounds that were not fired at the scene were found at the scene. They were checked for DNA. Some samples were obtained.\n\nThe evidence was driven to Connecticut's state crime lab in Meriden for analysis.\n\nThe Providence police remained the lead investigative agency, Lapatin says. Still, they prepared for the possibility of supporting a case for prosecution in federal court if necessary.\n\nRhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha is a former U.S. Attorney, and two high-ranking prosecutors in his office – Deputy Attorney General Adi Goldstein and the chief of Neronha's criminal division, Stephen Dambruch – also had extensive experience as federal prosecutors.\n\nThey were in a group of prosecutors stationed in Lapatin's office.\n\nThe tip center had about 15 investigators working the phones and recording the tips. Workflow benefited from an FBI system that funneled the tips into a bin where everyone could see them, Lapatin says.\n\n\"And the other thing that's going,\" Lapatin says, \"that's full force now, is our Real Time Crime Center.\"\n\nThe crime center, which launched this past summer, has links to more than 300 live cameras, police say.\n\nIf investigators looking at those cameras can identify a suspect or person of interest to follow, the center is designed to help them track the person across multiple video feeds from one location to another.\n\nThe center is not staffed around the clock, Lapatin says.\n\n\"If something happens, we always have somebody who can jump right in there,\" he says, adding that somebody was probably in the center \"minutes\" after the shooting.\n\nOn Monday morning, Dec. 15, as the public reacted to news about the Coventry lead not panning out, investigators focused on a third tip.\n\nThree different calls, each of them regarding the same man, were received in the tip center, Lapatin says.\n\nThe man's size and physique lined up. One caller said they thought the man might have worked at Brown in the past.\n\nThe investigation surveilled the person.\n\n\"That involved watching him go through his daily routines,\" Lapatin says.\n\nInvestigators hoped to pick up something, perhaps some trash, that would provide a sample of DNA.\n\n\"We had a team on him, waiting for an opportunity to get some DNA,\" he says.\n\nThe work on that angle of the case would continue for days, even as the investigation ultimately focused heavily on Neves Valente.\n\nAs of late Monday night, investigators had gone through thousands of minutes of video.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, they established seven grids to search for video, Lapatin says. Prior to this, the search for cameras was organized by individual streets.\n\nThe search for video gained organization and efficiency by examining each house for potential cameras. Sometimes, street investigators obtained video. Other times, specialists went to extract the video. Lapatin estimates that each grid had 100 or 150 properties.\n\n\"It was time-consuming,\" he says. \"I know people were anxious. It was being worked.\"\n\nInvestigators hoped that a surveillance video would lead them to a better image of the masked suspect or even to a car associated with him.\n\n\"So lead three is hanging out there,\" Lapatin says. \"Lead one's gone. Lead two is gone.\"\n\nOn Tuesday a post on Reddit started to draw a lot of attention from investigators.\n\nThe post referred to a gray Nissan with Florida plates parked by the Rhode Island Historical Society. It also mentioned a man who'd acted strangely, locking and unlocking the car with a key fob.\n\n\"It looks pretty good,\" Lapatin says.\n\nInvestigators, based on video from the area, were already aware of movements by the masked man on Cooke Street prior to the shooting as well as some sort of contact he'd had with another person.\n\nBut their video did not show any car, Lapatin says.\n\nAnd they would learn that that other person was the Reddit poster.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, Dec. 16 and 17, long before they finally interviewed the Reddit poster on Wednesday night, investigators worked to track down a gray Nissan with a Florida plate.\n\nThe gray Nissan represented the fourth major lead in the case. Investigators focused on a woman who owned such a vehicle with a Florida plate. When the detectives looked into it, they found that the vehicle had been observed in the area.\n\nAlso, the woman had a close relative who may have fit the profile, Lapatin says.\n\nAfter a lot of surveillance, they felt the lead wasn't the strongest, Lapatin says. They talked to the woman at work and corroborated that she had told them the truth about where she had been during the time in question. That lead was ruled out.\n\n\"It was a fluke,\" Lapatin says.\n\nThe fifth and final lead, the one that would take police to the shooter, a Miami man, emerged as investigators continued to look for a Nissan of any color with a Florida plate.\n\nCapt. Dennis P. O'Brien said that more than 100 investigators had worked stints of more than 20 hours at a time, or longer, without sleep. O'Brien recalls working 31 hours on one shift. The teams didn't quit on the Nissan.\n\nProvidence police detectives, including Detective Joseph Nezier and Detective Mitch Guerra, and state police Detective Sgt. Robert Hopkins and several others, digested great amounts of video to try to see the Nissan in the area. They also ran searches within the system of networked license-plate reading cameras on the East Side.\n\nThe information provided by the system showed that a blue Nissan had been on North Main Street, at Randall Street near Whole Foods, on dates in early December and in the area on the day before the shooting, Lapatin says.\n\nThe blue Nissan was identified in the North Main Street, Doyle Street, Camp Street area, Lapatin says.\n\nSimultaneously, investigators were still working to make contact with the man who had authored the post on Reddit.\n\nTo get his IP address, investigators had to get a subpoena, Lapatin says, adding that the FBI handled that.\n\nOn Wednesday night, investigators interviewed the Reddit poster.\n\nThe man who wrote the Reddit post had graduated from Brown University in 2010, Lapatin says. Where he actually lived wasn't perfectly clear to investigators, Lapatin acknowledges. Detectives didn't push that issue.\n\n\"We needed to know more important information,\" he says.\n\nIt was clear that the man, who has a cell phone, had spent a lot of time on the streets, frequently used the bathroom in the engineering building and was familiar enough and protective enough to spot someone who didn't belong there, Lapatin says.\n\n\"So he comes in,\" Lapatin says, referring to the Reddit poster, \"and he's very well-spoken. And he explains exactly what happened.\"\n\nThe masked man had raised his suspicions during an encounter in the building.\n\nHis post on Reddit, about a gray Nissan, had channeled the investigation toward Neves Valente.\n\n\"That was it from there, the hunt was on,\" Lapatin says.",

    "description": "The announcement was met with widespread scorn.",
    "fullText": "Purdue University's next batch of freshmen will be subjected to a surprising new requirement, according to a Forbes contributor.\n\nLast Friday, a university press release introduced a new graduation requirement starting in 2026: \"AI working competency.\"\n\nPurdue's announcement identified five \"areas\" — Learning with AI, Learning about AI, Research AI, Using AI, and Partnering in AI — in which undergrads would be expected to demonstrate proficiency.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been a prominent social and economic topic throughout 2025, and its impact on education, particularly at the university level, has been disruptive.\n\nIn October, the journal Nature observed that institutions were \"embracing\" AI and questioned whether it would accelerate learning or sabotage it. Recent editorials in Current Affairs and the Guardian postulated that AI was \"undermining\" education.\n\nJust as AI began firmly planting itself in school systems, parents of younger students began to distrust the technology's role in education, and college professors have vocally objected to its use and its potential to erode skill and knowledge.\n\nThe yet-to-be-seen impact of AI on education at all levels is just one of the controversies dogging this emerging technology. Market experts have warned that the AI \"arms race\" is little more than a bubble, a concern Google's CEO acknowledged had merit.\n\nRising electricity costs were another big news story in 2025, and a sharp increase in energy bills has repeatedly been linked to the AI data center boom.\n\nMuch of the United States' electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels, meaning these costs are paid not just in currency but also in increased harmful carbon pollution. Data centers also strain water resources, but tech firms are slow to disclose these impacts.\n\nOn the other hand, AI has shown promise for improving environmental problems, and if managed sustainably, the technology could cause less harm and more good. Research found AI could boost crop yields and perhaps eliminate supply chain waste efficiently.\n\nDo you worry about robots taking away our jobs?\n\nYes — but it will create new ones too\n\nPossibly — but not significantly\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIn academia, however, Purdue University's announcement was met with widespread scorn, in no small part because AI has acquired a reputation for supercharging plagiarism, particularly in scholarly and creative settings.\n\nSocial media users were also skeptical of Purdue's new commitment to AI.\n\n\"The concept of demonstrating 'competency' in a tool that's primarily a shortcut for incompetent people,\" a user who linked to the Forbes piece lamented.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (USF) – The University of Sioux Falls Men’s Basketball team closed the calendar year with offensive performance, knocking off Minnesota State 98–90 on Saturday afternoon inside the Stewart Center. Behind balanced scoring, dominance on the glass, and an aggressive approach against the Mavericks’ size, the Cougars earned a statement NSIC victory heading into the holiday break.\n\nSioux Falls leaned into its physicality and depth to secure the win, finishing with four players scoring 16 or more points and posting a decisive rebounding edge. USF shot 42.5 percent from the field while generating 52 points in the paint and 23 second-chance points. Bryon Laue delivered a breakout performance with 18 points and a game-high 16 rebounds, while Brandon Hrncir and Brogan Madson each added 18 points as the Cougars consistently attacked mismatches.\n\nThe Cougars took control at the free-throw line and in transition during the second half, converting 24-of-28 free throws after the break and scoring 22 fast-break points for the game. Jacoby Mehrman added 16 points on efficient shooting, and Camden Davis chipped in 10 points off the bench as USF outscored Minnesota State 54–49 in the second half to close out the 98–90 victory.\n\nThe opening 20 minutes featured a steady back-and-forth, with Sioux Falls building offense through paint touches and extra possessions. USF shot 43.6 percent from the field in the half and generated early success on the offensive glass, finishing the game with 23 offensive rebounds. Laue set the tone early on the boards, while Hrncir and Madson combined to keep the Cougars in rhythm offensively.\n\nMinnesota State shot efficiently in the first half at 47.2 percent, but Sioux Falls countered by limiting perimeter damage and forcing the Mavericks to earn points inside. The Cougars went 8-of-11 at the free-throw line in the half and carried a 44–41 advantage into the locker room.\n\nSioux Falls seized control after halftime by attacking relentlessly and capitalizing at the stripe. The Cougars scored 54 second-half points and went 24-of-28 at the free-throw line, repeatedly punishing Minnesota State for fouling. Mehrman and Hrncir were effective in finishing through contact, while Madson orchestrated the offense and drew fouls attacking downhill.\n\nAlthough Minnesota State shot 51.5 percent in the half and scored 49 points, USF offset that efficiency with rebounding, transition scoring, and second-chance opportunities. The Cougars won the rebounding battle 49–33 and turned those extra possessions into timely buckets and free throws, allowing them to maintain separation and close out the win.\n\n“I thought we played very well on the offensive end against their size. We had some guys really step up, notably Laue, Mehrman, and Hrncir. A fun way to go into the break.”\n— Head Coach Chris Johnson\n\nBryon Laue – 18 points, 16 rebounds, 7-of-14 FG\n\nBrandon Hrncir – 18 points, 9 rebounds, 7-of-8 FT\n\nBrogan Madson – 18 points, 6 assists, 9-of-12 FT\n\nJacoby Mehrman – 16 points, 5 rebounds, 6-of-11 FG\n\nKyle Ingwerson – 10 points, 2 steals\n\nRebounding: Sioux Falls dominated the glass 49–33, including 23 offensive rebounds that led to 23 second-chance points.\n\nFree Throws: The Cougars went 32-of-39 at the line, including 24-of-28 in the second half.\n\nPaint: USF scored 52 points in the paint by consistently attacking Minnesota State’s interior.\n\nTransition: Sioux Falls tallied 22 fast-break points, capitalizing on defensive stops and rebounds.\n\nBalance: Five Cougars scored in double figures as USF spread scoring across the lineup.\n\nThe Cougars return to action on January 3, traveling to Marshall, Minnesota, to take on Southwest Minnesota State at 2:00 p.m.",

    "fullText": "As investigators work to find a motive behind the mass shooting at Brown University and the slaying of an acclaimed MIT professor, former classmates of the accused killer described him as a brilliant but exceptionally difficult student.\n\nClaudio Neves Valente, the 48-year-old suspect who police say was found dead Thursday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was a top student but a disruptive personality in his native Portugal, recalled classmates on Friday.\n\nNeves Valente studied at Instituto Superior Técnico along with Nuno Loureiro, the MIT professor he is now accused of shooting to death. The school confirmed to CNN that both men were students there between 1995 and 2000, and that Neves Valente studied for a degree in Technological Physics Engineering.\n\nThat engineering course was full of gifted students, recalled classmate Felipe Moura – but Neves Valente stood out, for good and bad reasons.\n\n“Claudio was obviously one of the best, but in class he had a great need to stand out and show that he was better than the rest,” Moura wrote in Portuguese in a Facebook post.\n\n“Claudio’s attitude was unpleasant,” he continued, often arguing with “colleagues he didn’t consider as brilliant as him (and who probably weren’t),” he wrote. “They were totally unnecessary quarrels, which did not help the class at all.”\n\nMoura, who now teaches at a Lisbon university, did not respond to messages from CNN. A former classmate, who asked not to be quoted by name, confirmed that Moura’s Facebook account was authentic.\n\nIn an interview with Público, a newspaper in Portugal, Moura echoed his impressions of Neves Valente as an aggressive classmate.\n\n“He had a confrontational personality in class. In other words, the other good students would intervene, ask questions, [but] Claudio liked to say that he was the one who knew,” Moura told the paper.\n\nNuno Morais, another classmate, told Público that Neves Valente and Loureiro were among the top students at the school – but their personalities were starkly different.\n\n“Claudio was one of the students with the best grades in the course. He was much more theoretical,” Morais told the paper. “Nuno was also a good student, he stood out less in terms of grades, but he was a more relaxed person—and seemed to have a knack for slightly more applied subjects.”\n\nAfter graduating in Portugal, Neves Valente enrolled at Brown University in 2000 as a graduate student in physics but did not finish the program. Moura said he stayed in touch with Neves Valente at the time and found that he was once again clashing with other students.\n\n“I exchanged many emails with him at the time and saw that he maintained the same attitude — as he told me —of maintaining unnecessary conflicts with PhD colleagues in class, which he again considered far less capable than he was,” Moura wrote on Facebook. “I could tell that he wasn’t enjoying being at Brown University.”\n\nScott Watson, a classmate at Brown, said Valente was “socially awkward” and that he became his only friend at the university. He struggled in the US, complaining bitterly that classes weren’t challenging and that the food was poor, Watson recalled.\n\n“He would say the classes were too easy—honestly, for him they were. He already knew most of the material and was genuinely impressive,” Watson, who is now a professor at Syracuse University, said in a statement shared with CNN.\n\nWatson said Valente could be “kind and gentle” but that he was also volatile as well.\n\n“He often became frustrated—sometimes angry—about courses, professors, and living conditions,” Watson said, recalling that once he had to break up a fight between Valente and another classmate he often insulted.\n\nMoura said he tried to convince Valente to stay with the graduate program, but he left after one year.\n\n“Claudio thought none of it was worth it, which was a waste of time and the others were all incapable,” he said on Facebook.\n\nIn an archived Brown website, Neves Valente appears to write to classmates that he’s left the school “permanently.” The note, first reported by the New York Times, includes an email address to reach him and a cryptic note: “The best liar is he who is able to fool himself. They are everywhere, but sometimes proliferate in the most unexpected places.”\n\nA directory of physics graduate students at Brown from that time links to the website alongside a student email address for Neves Valente. The directory shows that he was assigned to room 122 at the Barus and Holley engineering building. Neves Valente carried out his shooting in room 166 in the same building last week, police say.\n\nIt’s unclear what Neves Valente did in the intervening years. Moura wrote on Facebook that he heard he’d returned to Portugal to work for an internet provider; police say he received a visa and returned to the US in 2017, though it is unclear what he did for work.\n\nHis last known address was in Miami, police said.\n\nHis former classmates have been left trying to understand what could have motivated the brutal violence.\n\n“I never expected he would be capable of such a thing,” Moura wrote.\n\nCNN’s Vasco Cotovio, Thomas Bordeaux, Julia Vargas Jones contributed to this report.",

    "description": "A Reddit user provided information that helped identify Claudio Manuel Neves Valente as the suspect not only in the campus shooting but also in the murder of an M.I.T. professor.",
    "fullText": "Three days after the deadly shooting at Brown University, officers received an anonymous tip that stuck out from a flood of information. It directed the authorities to a post on Reddit.\n\n“I’m being dead serious. The police need to look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental,” the Reddit user posted, according to an affidavit filed by the police in Providence, R.I.\n\nThat tip would later lead to a breakthrough not only in the search for the campus attacker but also the hunt for the suspect in the murder of a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It also ended the dayslong manhunt that had put both the Brown and M.I.T. communities on edge.\n\nA day after the Reddit post was made, the writer approached law enforcement officials and told them about his encounter with a suspicious man in Brown University’s Barus and Holley building.\n\nThe information “blew this case right open,” Attorney General Peter F. Neronha of Rhode Island said in a news conference Thursday.\n\nThe tipster, whom the police referred to only as John, said that he encountered the suspect inside a bathroom on the ground floor of the building between 1:45 p.m. and 2 p.m., around two hours before the first shots were reported. John said that the suspect’s clothing was inappropriate for the weather and that they had made eye contact.\n\nJohn told the police that he followed the man after he left the building to a Nissan with a Florida plate. But instead of entering the vehicle, the suspect started walking around the block, with John behind him. John said it was like “a game of cat and mouse.”\n\nAt one point, the two men spoke. According to the affidavit, John asked the suspect, “Your car is back there, why are you circling the block?” To which the suspect responded, “Why are you harassing me?” John went his own way soon after.\n\nMayor Brett P. Smiley of Providence told CNN that the Reddit tipster was a Brown graduate who had been pictured in a photograph released by the police. However, John wrote on Reddit on Thursday that he is not the man in the photograph.\n\n“He provided the Reddit tip initially. Anonymously,” Mr. Smiley said. “And then when we put the photo out and put the call out that we needed to talk to this person, he then turned up to a Providence police officer and was fully forthcoming. And so it’s sort of an amazing sequence of events, but really turned out to be critical to our investigation. We’re grateful to him.”\n\nWhen the police showed John images of the suspect’s car from safety cameras, he said: “That might be it.”\n\nIt was the breakthrough the authorities had been looking for.\n\nThe suspect’s vehicle was a key detail in the investigation. A Brown University faculty member had also described a suspicious vehicle in the same neighborhood, a gray sedan with Florida plates. It did not take long for investigators to find that the car was from an Alamo rental location in downtown Boston.\n\nAnd from the rental agreement, they got a name: Claudio Manuel Neves Valente.\n\nThen came more information about the suspect: He was a Portuguese national. Brown University said he was a former student, enrolled from the fall of 2000 through the 2001 spring semester. He was there for a Ph.D. in physics, but withdrew from that program in 2003.\n\nTravel records showed that years later, in 2017, Mr. Neves Valente returned to the United States as a legal permanent resident.\n\nAt this point, the investigations into the Brown University shooting and the murder three days later of Nuno F.G. Loureiro, a professor at M.I.T., appeared to converge.\n\nThrough surveillance footage, investigators tracked the gray Nissan to near Dr. Loureiro’s home. They also determined that the suspect drove that car to a storage unit in Salem, N.H., where they found the body of Mr. Neves Valente, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, on Thursday night.\n\nThe investigators now also knew that Mr. Neves Valente had rented hotel rooms in Boston, as well as that storage unit. And according to Leah B. Foley, the U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, Mr. Neves Valente and Dr. Loureiro had attended the same academic program in Portugal from 1995 to 2000.\n\nAt some point after the shooting at Brown, the plates on the suspect’s car were changed from Florida to Maine, Ms. Foley added.\n\nThe suspect’s motives in both attacks remain under investigation.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of unknowns,” said Mr. Neronha, the attorney general of Rhode Island. “In terms of why Brown? I think that’s a mystery.”\n\nVictor Mather contributed reporting.",

Our earlier story is below.\n\nLaw enforcement are investigating possible connections between the mass shooting at Brown University and the targeted killing of an MIT professor two days later, sources told CBS News.\n\nInvestigators are searching for a suspect in the mass shooting and a car that the person is believed to have rented, multiple law enforcement sources said. Authorities believe the rented vehicle is the same make and model of a car that was also detected in the vicinity of the MIT professor's apartment.\n\nMeanwhile, two law enforcement sources also told CBS News that an arrest warrant has been issued for a suspect in the Brown shooting.\n\nNuno Loureiro, who taught plasma physics at MIT and led its Plasma Science and Fusion Center, was shot Monday at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts. He died at a nearby hospital the next day. Police are investigating his death as a homicide.\n\nTwo days earlier, two students were killed and nine more were wounded when a gunman opened fire Saturday afternoon inside a classroom on Brown University's campus in Providence, Rhode Island, authorities said. The shooting occurred in the school's Barus & Holley engineering building during final exams.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting, police said a male suspect had managed to escape from the building. In the hours and days that followed, police and the FBI released images and videos of the man they described as a person of interest walking around a nearby neighborhood several hours before the first 911 calls reporting the shooting came in.\n\nThe person in the images wore black clothing and a face mask. None of the footage pictured him clearly.\n\nA video released on Tuesday, though blurry, was the clearest picture of the person of interest released so far. The image appeared to be digitally enhanced.\n\nJohn Mulvaney, an FBI veteran of 26 years and the managing director of CBIZ Forensix Consulting Group, told CBS News Boston the footage appeared to show the person of interest \"casing the neighborhood.\"\n\nThe FBI is offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the shooting.\n\nThe two students killed in the shooting were identified as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an Uzbek American freshman student.\n\n\"Both were brilliant and beloved — as members of our campus community, but even more by their friends and families,\" Brown's president, Christina H. Paxson, wrote in a letter Tuesday to the university community. \"Our hearts continue to be with them in their profound sorrow.\"\n\nPerson of interest identified in deadly Brown University shooting\n\nWhat to expect from Trump's address to the nation\n\nNew surveillance video shows Nick Reiner before his arrest",

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on the social platform X that, at Trump’s direction, she is ordering the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the program.  “This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” she said of the suspect, Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump suspended the green card lottery program on Thursday that allowed the suspect in the Brown University and MIT shootings to come to the United States.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on the social platform X that, at Trump’s direction, she is ordering the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the program.\n\n“This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” she said of the suspect, Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente.\n\nNeves Valente, 48, is suspected in the shootings at Brown University that killed two students and wounded nine others, and the killing of an MIT professor. He was found dead Thursday evening from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.\n\nNeves Valente had studied at Brown on a student visa beginning in 2000, according to an affidavit from a Providence police detective. In 2017, he was issued a diversity immigrant visa and months later obtained legal permanent residence status, according to the affidavit. It was not immediately clear where he was between taking a leave of absence from the school in 2001 and getting the visa in 2017.\n\nThe diversity visa program makes up to 50,000 green cards available each year by lottery to people from countries that are little represented in the U.S., many of them in Africa. The lottery was created by Congress, and the move is almost certain to invite legal challenges.\n\nNearly 20 million people applied for the 2025 visa lottery, with more than 131,000 selected when including spouses with the winners. After winning, they must undergo vetting to win admission to the United States. Portuguese citizens won only 38 slots.\n\nLottery winners are invited to apply for a green card. They are interviewed at consulates and subject to the same requirements and vetting as other green-card applicants.\n\nTrump has long opposed the diversity visa lottery. Noem’s announcement is the latest example of using tragedy to advance immigration policy goals. After an Afghan man was identified as the gunman in a fatal attack on National Guard members in November, Trump’s administration imposed sweeping rules against immigration from Afghanistan and other counties.\n\nWhile pursuing mass deportation, Trump has sought to limit or eliminate avenues to legal immigration. He has not been deterred if they are enshrined in law, like the diversity visa lottery, or the Constitution, as with a right to citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil. The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear his challenge to birthright citizenship.",

    "description": "Authorities announced they tracked down the man responsible for the deadly Brown University shooting that rocked the Ivy League institution.",
    "fullText": "Authorities on Dec. 18 announced they tracked down the man responsible for both the deadly Brown University shooting and the shooting death of Nuno F.G. Loureiro, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor two days later, and found him dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a Salem, Massachusetts storage unit.\n\nClaudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, originally from Portugal, was a former Brown University PhD physics student, who knew Loureiro, authorities said at two separate news conferences on the night of Dec. 18.\n\nInvestigators said they identified Valente on the afternoon of Dec. 17 and were able to connect him to both crime scenes through financial background information, including car rental records for the car he rented and drove to Providence and back to Massachusetts.\n\nThe Brown shootings rocked the Ivy League School and the school's surrounding community.\n\nAuthorities at the news conference in Boston, said Valente was \"sophisticated in covering his tracks,\" including obscuring his cell phone so it couldn't be tracked, switching plates on his rental car andnot using credit cards in his name.\n\nAn affidavit signed by a Rhode Island district judge said police cracked the case after a tipster recognized a rental car circling the area. The tipster said police should be looking for a gray Nissan Altima and license plate, information the police hadn't previously released. Police then tracked down images of Neves Valente renting the car at an Alamo location in Boston.\n\nHere's what to know about the shooter:\n\nNeves Valente entered the country in 2000 on a student F-1 visa. He was admitted as a lawful permanent resident in 2017.\n\nBrown officials say he was a PhD student before taking a leave of absence in April 2001. He withdrew on July 31, 2003. His last known address was in Miami, according to police.\n\nThe tipster took his information first to the social media site Reddit, posting: \"I'm being dead serious. The police need to look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental,\" John, whose last name is being withheld by authorities, wrote, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe announcement comes after authorities urged the public to help with the widening investigation and dayslong search for the person suspected of carrying out the attack. Earlier in the week, authorities released enhanced images and video footage of the person investigators believe could be tied to the shooting that killed two people and injured nine others.\n\nProvidence Police Chief Oscar Perez said investigators had evidence that the possible suspect was near the university hours before the shooting. Footage from neighborhood cameras shared by authorities showed the person in dark clothing and wearing a mask walking along streets a few blocks away from the campus on Dec. 13.\n\nInvestigators believe it was likely the person was \"casing\" the scene, according to Perez.\n\n\"There's a lot of leads we have here that show that the person who committed this tragedy is the guy in this video,\" the police chief said.\n\nThough officials said on Dec. 16 that they were confident the person in the video is the suspect, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha noted that they had \"zero\" evidence for the motive in the attack. Witnesses said the person was likely in his 30s, and it was unclear if they were affiliated with the university, Perez said.\n\n'Bright light' and 'role model.' Brown University victims remembered\n\nPolice received more than 200 tips since the shooting, according to Perez. The police chief had asked for the public’s help in identifying the suspected gunman, saying investigators were hoping the new footage would help someone recognize the person.\n\n\"Focus on the body movements, the way the person moved their arms, the body posture, the way they carry the weight,\" Perez said. “I think those are important movement patterns that may help you identify this individual, which is extremely important.”\n\nThe footage included a timeline video that comprised surveillance video from neighborhood cameras and a vehicle’s dash camera.\n\nIn one video, the suspected shooter can be seen leaving the scene of the shooting as a police car with flashing emergency lights arrives. The final video shows the suspect walking along that street just minutes after the attack.\n\nThe shooting at the Ivy League University occurred shortly before 4:05 p.m. local time on Dec. 13 in an engineering building with unlocked doors as final exams were underway. Authorities said the suspect opened fire with a 9mm gun inside a classroom and then fled.\n\nThe shooting prompted a campus lockdown that left students barricaded in rooms or hiding for hours. Officers recovered 9mm shell casings from the scene, and Perez said investigators believe the suspect \"definitely targeted Brown University.\"\n\nTwo students were killed, and nine others were injured in the attack. The two students killed were identified as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Mountain Brook, Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, a freshman from Virginia who immigrated from Uzbekistan.\n\nAs of Dec. 16, two of the wounded students were released from the hospital. Of the seven people who remained hospitalized, authorities said one was in critical condition, five were in critical but stable condition, and one was in stable condition.\n\nBrown University, which has nearly 11,000 undergraduate and graduate students, is considered one of the most prestigious colleges in the country. Brown was founded in 1764 and is located in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Brown, MIT suspect found dead.

They confirmed that officers are in Salem, New Hampshire, where the suspected shooter’s abandoned car was found near a storage facility.\n\nPolice scanner audio reveals police were searching for a gray Nissan Sentra with Maine plates in Salem, New Hampshire, in connection with a homicide in Brookline, Massachusetts, where MIT nuclear physicist Nuno Loureiro was found with gunshot wounds in his apartment Monday night.\n\nTrump Urges Capture Of 'Animal' Gunman In Brown University Shooting, Says No Motive Yet\n\nEarlier this week, FBI Boston's special agent in charge Ted Docks told reporters that investigators were sharing intelligence regarding both cases but had not come up with a clear tie.\n\nUnverified reports in both Providence, Rhode Island, and Brookline, Massachusetts, have described Nissan Sentras at the scene, although they were described as having license plates from different states.\n\nOn Thursday, the regional CBS affiliate WPRI-TV reported that senior law enforcement sources said they have discovered evidence of a connection. It's unclear what that evidence is.\n\nA masked gunman barged into a lecture hall at Brown University in Providence around 4 p.m. Saturday and killed two students, injuring nine more. Authorities said they recovered 9mm bullet casings from the scene.\n\nA person of interest was seen Saturday a few minutes later on surveillance video in the neighborhood east of Brown's campus.\n\n'Older' Brown Building Where Shooting Happened Had No Cameras As President’s Even Older Home Appears Equipped\n\nThen around 8:30 p.m. Monday, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno F. Gomes Loureiro, 47, was discovered with multiple gunshot wounds in his apartment in Brookline, a short drive from campus. He was pronounced dead at a hospital the following morning.\n\nLoureiro was a renowned nuclear physicist, director of MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center and a recipient of a presidential award honoring his research from the White House earlier this year.\n\nAuthorities have not described what kind of weapon was used to kill Loureiro.\n\nThe shooting left two students dead, identified as Ella Cook of Alabama and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov of Virginia, and nine injured. Six of the survivors remained hospitalized as of Thursday afternoon. One is in critical but stable condition, the others were stable.\n\nFox News' Sandy Ibrahim contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

He’s good on the edge. He’s fast. He’s played inside a little bit. He’s played on the edge.”\n\nGainer recorded 27 tackles and 2.5 sacks in his one season at UNC. He finished his college career with 237 total tackles.\n\n“He played inside at Florida State, if I remember, in college,” Maye said. “He moved to the edge once he got to North Carolina. So, I know he was with Vegas, and it’s good to see him back. I think everybody’s just trying to see what they can do just to help us, whether it’s on game day, throughout practice or whatever he can do.”\n\nGainer appeared in 17 games as a rookie with the Las Vegas Raiders, playing mostly in a special teams capacity. The 25-year-old provides good size to the practice squad and a great motor, according to Maye.\n\n“I know he’s going to work hard, and I know he’s got a good work ethic,” Maye said.\n\nMike Vrabel-Bashing Radio Host Shreds Patriots Coach Amid Josh McDaniels Debate",

Police say the person in the photo was \"in proximity of the person of interest.\"\n\nAnyone who recognizes the person, or with information about the shooting, is urged to call the tip line at 401-272-3121.\n\nAs the manhunt for the gunman who took the lives of two students stretches into Wednesday, investigators say their highest priority is identifying a person of interest they’ve released numerous photos and videos of. Officials said during a Tuesday evening press conference that they believe this is the critical next step in charging someone in the shooting.\n\n“Once we identify who this person is, I believe we’ll be able to locate them,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said.\n\nGunfire erupted on the first floor of Brown’s Barus and Holley engineering and physics building around 4 p.m. on Dec. 13 during an economics class. The shooting left sophomore Ella Cook and first-year student Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov dead and nine other students injured.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, one of the injured students was in critical condition, five more were in critical but stable condition, and one was in stable condition, according to law enforcement and Brown University. Two have been released from Rhode Island Hospital.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have described the person of interest as being approximately 5-foot-8 inches tall with a “stocky build.” Photos and videos shared by police show what appears to be man dressed in dark clothing, including a beanie and face mask, walking down the street near Brown University approximately two hours before the shooting.\n\nOfficials have asked anyone associated with Brown or who lives or spends time around Providence to review the photos and videos of the person of interest. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the “identification, arrest and conviction of the individual.”\n\nProvidence Police Chief Col. Oscar L. Perez, Jr. advised the public to focus on the body movements of the person of interest shown in the videos during the press conference Tuesday evening.\n\n“You wanna focus on the body movements, the way the person moved their arms, the body posture, the way they carry their weight,” he said.\n\nInvestigators said they are hoping to receive more footage of the person of interest from the public, as they speculate that he may have walked around the area surrounding Brown University as much as a week prior to the shooting.\n\n“We also know in this profession that many criminals will pace out an area weeks and days prior,” Perez explained.\n\nPolice share map of Brown University shooting person of interest’s movements\n\nBrown University shooting investigation spills over into Massachusetts\n\nInvestigators release video timeline of person of interest in Brown campus shooting’s movements\n\nBrown University shooting victim remembered for having a heart ‘as large as the sun’\n\nPolice now trying to ID person ‘in proximity of’ Brown University shooting person of interest",

    "fullText": "Two years after the Supreme Court effectively ended race-conscious college admissions nationwide, Johns Hopkins University has seen a significant change in the racial makeup of its freshman class, according to newly released enrollment data.\n\nSince 2023, the number of Asian first-year undergraduate students, as measured by federal reporting standards, has risen nearly 20 percentage points, to 45.1% from 25.6%. Black first-year student representation, meanwhile, has been cut in half, dropping to 4% from 9.8%, as has the Hispanic student population, which fell to 10.1% this year from 20.8% two years ago. White freshman enrollment remained relatively flat, at 21% in 2025, compared with 19.3% in 2023. Those self-reporting as white fell more sharply to 30.9% from 39.1%.\n\nThe data offer a clear, local snapshot of how elite universities may be changing in the wake of the 2023 ruling, which prohibited schools from considering race in admissions. While universities across the country warned the decision could reduce racial diversity, Johns Hopkins’ numbers show an especially stark shift.\n\n“Since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in [Students for Fair Admissions] v Harvard, we have been navigating an evolving legal and regulatory environment,” said university spokesman J.B. Bird in an email to the Baltimore Sun. “We continue to work on opening our doors as wide as possible to students from all backgrounds and perspectives.”\n\nThe research university has seen some success in its efforts to diversify by income level, regardless of race. The 2025 freshman class has the highest-ever number of Pell grant recipients, at 24.1%, up slightly from 23.8% last year and 21.6% the year before. First-generation college student admission remained flat from last year at 20.3% percent, but up from 19.4% in 2023. Both Pell grant recipients and first-generation college students had risen steadily since 2010.\n\nThe university’s new Tuition Promise program could also increase diversity in the coming years, said Amelia, a second-year graduate student who declined to give her last name.\n\nThe program, which begins next year, with January admissions, offers a free education to students whose families earn less than $200,000, and includes living expenses for those making less than $100,000.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision is already changing higher education in more ways than student body demographics can reveal, said Bryan Cook higher education policy director of the nonpartisan Urban Institute think tank. Johns Hopkins is not unique, though the court’s decision more strongly impacted private, elite college and universities that had been trying to recruit more diverse student bodies, Cook said. Schools like community colleges that accept all applications, and state schools that rely primarily on test scores for admissions, would not be affected, he said.\n\nA lot of institutions are having to make significant changes in their policies,” Cook said. “In many cases, this is already changing the demographics of what campuses look like.”\n\nIt’s difficult to determine the whole story, he said, admissions data only shows part of what is happening.\n\n“We know nothing about the demographics of their applicant pool and how that might line up with admissions,” Cook explained. “We don’t know what’s happening universally across all schools.”\n\nThe Urban Institute reached out to universities to request applicant data to improve their understanding, publishing their findings in July of 2025.\n\n“Early analysis from 18 institutions suggests that Black students’ share of the applicant pool increased more between 2023 and 2024 than in any of the prior five years,” the report states, “but their share of the admitted student pool held constant or even decreased. Furthermore, an increasing number of applicants have chosen not to disclose their race or ethnicity.”\n\nAmong elite universities, those admitting less than half of their applicants, Black student admissions fell to 5.9% in 2024 from 6.6% in 2023, while Black admissions at less selective schools remained level.\n\nMost Americans support fair admissions, said Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, the organization that brought the lawsuit against Harvard, resulting in the Supreme Court decision.\n\n“Credible polling from across the political spectrum indicates that Americans agree that a student’s race or ethnicity should not be considered as a factor in whether that student is accepted or rejected at any university,” Blum said.\n\nHopkins student Aaden, who asked to only be identified by his first name.\n\n“I believe it is important to have a diverse student body,” said Aaden, a third-year chemistry student, “although I think if we were picking people because of their race, it’s not fair to Asian and white students. People with lower grades might be picked because of their race.”\n\nAaden lives in Florida, where his parents immigrated from the Caribbean. He said he hasn’t experienced racism on campus but understands how new Black and Hispanic students might feel more isolated this year.\n\nMaria Laskaris, a college counselor from TopTier Admissions, helps students prepare for and get into schools best suited for their needs, beginning younger than high school age. She agreed that the Supreme Court ruling affects primarily highly selective private institutions, but said the changes would not necessarily change how she advises minority student clients.\n\n“I would make sure that any student I advise is aware of the landscape in which they are applying to college and various policies of the colleges they’re interested in,” she said. “It’s about how you set yourself apart. What do you bring to the table that makes you stand out from other applicants?”\n\nTricia Bishop contributed to this report.\n\nHave a news tip?

    "description": "Professor Gene Sharp of Southeastern Massachusetts University has given several years of study to the possibilities of deterrence and resistance by",
    "fullText": "Professor Gene Sharp of Southeastern Massachusetts University has given several years of study to the possibilities of deterrence and resistance by civilians as a conceivable alternative, or partial alternative, to the traditional, purely military concepts of national defense that have so long prevailed and continue to prevail in European countries. He has restricted the range of applicability of his researches and reflections to Europe, and has directed them, within those limits, primarily to the neutral countries such as Austria and Finland. But his study is intended to apply, at least hypothetically, to such other countries, now members of one or the other of the great nuclear alliances, as might in some distant future succeed in detaching themselves from the alliance in question and thus find themselves compelled to devise an independent defense policy that makes sense with regard to the military and political realities of the present day. The question addressed in this book is essentially this: Where is the peace-loving, nonaggressive, and nonaligned country to find the maximum security against outside interference and domination in a world where war itself, and therefore the traditional preparations for war, have lost so much of their rationale as instruments of national policy?\n\nThe answer in the NATO establishment (and perhaps also, although with diminished conviction and enthusiasm, in the Soviet one, too) would be: in the nuclear deterrent, of course. Either, one would say, you have your own nuclear arsenal, or you ally yourself with someone else who has one.\n\nMr. Sharp challenges (quite correctly in the opinion of this reviewer) the validity of this supposed alternative. Not only is the nuclear deterrent by its very nature dangerously unstable but it is not really a means of defense. In the concept of nuclear deterrence, Mr. Sharp notes, “the capacity to defend in order to deter has been replaced by the capability to destroy massively without the ability to defend.” Beyond this there is, for any country wishing to go the nuclear road, the necessity of choosing between the development of a nuclear arsenal of one’s own, at vast expense and in defiance of the international effort to restrict proliferation, and the acceptance of an alliance with some existing nuclear power—a relationship bound, as experience has shown, to raise the unanswerable question about whose interests, those of the protector or those of the nominally protected, are eventually to prevail in a moment of crisis so brief as to be responsive only to the impulses of the computer.\n\nFinally, as Mr. Sharp also points out, to create a nuclear arsenal or to accept someone else’s missiles on one’s own territory is to increase immensely, from a point of near zero to a very high level, the danger that in any sort of a nuclear conflict one’s own country will become a likely target. Mr. Sharp could even have strengthened his case, in this respect, by pointing out that the Soviet leaders have repeatedly and specifically affirmed that they would never use nuclear weapons against any country that did not itself deploy them or permit them to be deployed on its own territory—an assurance that deserves greater credence than it has generally received, not only because there would be no reason to put out such a statement exclusively to deceive, but also because, given the general irrationality of the nuclear weapon, that policy in question makes perfectly good sense.\n\nThus for a nonnuclear country determined to pursue an independent policy but required to live under the shadow of the nuclear competition of the two super-powers, the nuclear option is not a hopeful one. But neither, for that matter, is an exclusive reliance on the traditional concepts of defense with “conventional” weapons. In an age of long-range striking power by aircraft, by missiles, even by long-range artillery, the idea of defense at the frontier has lost its reality. Beyond that, such is now the destructive power of even nonnuclear weapons that a war fought with them, particularly a defensive war presumably conducted largely on one’s own territory, promises nothing but a degree of devastation that makes a mockery of the very idea of military victory. Here we simply get back to the fact that war, generally, as among the industrially advanced and technologically sophisticated countries, can no longer serve any useful purpose—not even that of a defense.\n\nIt did not, actually, take the post–World War II advances in weapons technology to establish this fact. It is inescapably clear that in the two great European wars of this century there were, in reality, no victors. These were, in effect, simply senseless orgies of destruction. The damages they inflicted, on the nominal victor and the defeated alike, were far greater and more insidious than people were even aware of at the time, reaching as they did into the spiritual and genetic as well as the purely military and physical realms. It is idle for the independent European country of this day to suppose that by entering into a new and even more horrible round of such carnage it could protect anything worth protecting.\n\nThese two supposed alternatives for an independent defense on the part of the unaligned Continental country are therefore, when looked at carefully, no alternatives at all. It is not surprising, in these circumstances, that people’s minds should turn to the question whether there might not be some means of defense that would at least hold out hope of avoiding the sheer physical disasters that both of these supposed alternatives invite. It is this necessity that has led to Professor Sharp’s inquiry into the possibilities and limitations of civilian-based defense; and it would be unfair to judge it in any way other than in relation to the unpromising nature of these two, and only, visible alternatives. It is worth bearing in mind, as one reads his book, that however one assesses the possibilities of civilian-based defense, the nature of the available alternatives is such that it would not take much to be preferable to them.\n\nMr. Sharp’s study addresses itself, as its subtitle (The Potential of Civilian-based Deterrence and Defence) implies, both to deterrence and to resistance if deterrence fails. The two are of course closely connected; but each requires separate treatment, and receives it.\n\nDeterrence, in this instance, is of particular importance. For the study starts, as so much conventional military thinking fails to do, from the assumption that the presumptive attacker is motivated not just by a blind urge to destroy for destruction’s sake but rather by a wholly rational desire to gain domination over the political life of the victim country and to use that domination to his own advantage. And here, of course, is where the reactions of the civilian population—its will to resist and the preparation it has been given for doing so—come in. To deny this is to fly in the face of the historical evidence. For if we consider the failure of other powers to attack Switzerland during the two world wars, the failure of the Soviet Union to occupy Finland in the wake of their conflicts during World War II, and the similar abstention by Moscow from attacking Yugoslavia after that country’s break with the Soviet Union in 1948, we can see that calculations relating to the respective country’s presumptive powers of internal resistance, while certainly not the only considerations that played a part, occupied a prominent place among those that determined the final decision.\n\nThe successful imposition of foreign domination over a given country requires the ability of the dominating power to find, from among the population of that country, a faction either so inspired ideologically or so successfully cowed as to serve as a puppet government. It then requires that this faction should have the capacity to recruit the requisite indigenous bureaucracy, and to compel the population to accept and respect its authority. But whether these conditions can or cannot be met is something that will be importantly affected by the extent and effectiveness of the training, indoctrination, and general preparation for resistance that the population has received in advance of the event. This, in turn, is something the potential aggressor is likely to have a fair idea of before he takes the decision whether or not to attack; and his decision is bound to be affected by his assessment of its importance.\n\nAs for resistance itself if deterrence fails, there are a great many possible forms of this (Mr. Sharp has himself identified nearly two hundred of them). Some of these may be overt and largely spontaneous; others require the most highly centralized leadership, training, and direction. Some are designed to have military effect; others are directed solely to civilian administration. Some require mass participation; others can be conducted only conspiratorially, by carefully selected and highly trained individuals. The mix to be chosen in any given instance must depend on the nature of the country in question and the peculiarities of the prevailing situation. To select among these, and to conduct careful advance planning and preparation for their implementation, is a function that lies at the heart of civilian-based defense as Mr. Sharp sees it; and it is precisely in this respect that his reflections are most importantly innovative.\n\nFor seldom, if ever, in the contests of the past, has there been any such thing as this careful advance preparation. The resistance movements that made themselves felt during the Second World War were almost without exception ones that had to be improvised under conditions of extreme danger and difficulty—under the eyes and guns, that is, of the occupier. There can be no doubt that had they had the sort of advance preparation this study envisages, their effectiveness would have been increased several times over. Lines of command would have been known; effective channels of communication would have existed; there would have been adequate caches of weapons and supplies; ordinary citizens would have had guidance and instruction as to how to behave; given types of action would have been rehearsed and prepared.\n\nSkeptics may point to the long endurance of the Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe as evidence of the hopelessness of civilian resistance to domination by a strong outside power. But again, what they will be citing as an example is not at all what Mr. Sharp has in mind. There was, in those instances, no possibility whatsoever for advance preparation—quite the contrary. What the Soviet authorities found before them, as their armies overran this great region, was a territory where all semblance of real indigenous authority had already been swept away by the preceding Nazi-German occupation. It is often forgotten that it was not the Russians but the Nazis who destroyed the prewar status quo in that part of the world, and with it all social and political stability. What the Russians found there was in fact a territory ideally prepared to receive just the sort of domination they were desirous of establishing—a situation, in short, just the opposite of the one Mr. Sharp has in mind when he examines the possibilities of a resistance well prepared in advance by an indigenous government enjoying the confidence of the people. For this concept, there are, in fact, few examples. It is a modern concept, addressed to the unprecedented conditions of this modern age.\n\nI am not in total agreement with all of Mr. Sharp’s argument. There are places where the emphasis, in my view, could have been usefully shifted. I would have placed more weight on highly centralized, clandestine direction, less on spontaneous mass action. I am not sure that the nature of civilian defense planning should be so widely publicized as the author of the book would seem to envisage. I am less sanguine than he is about the possibilities for demoralizing the armed forces of an intruder. But these are minor differences, particularly if we take into account the limitations Mr. Sharp has placed on his own conclusions.\n\nThere is, of course, in this endangered world, no such thing as absolute defense for anyone; and Mr. Sharp advances no claim that a civilian-based system would provide this. He does not even claim that civilian-based defense could usefully constitute the only component of an adequate defense policy. He recognizes that it might have to be combined, at one stage or another, with the actions of certain types of regular military forces. He does not even depict his own conclusions as definitive. His plea is only that civilian-based defense has a legitimate place among the options open to the sort of country he is talking about; that this place is plainly larger than has been generally supposed; and that its possibilities ought to be more carefully studied and considered than they have been in the past. His primary purpose in writing the book was, he says, “to make civilian-based deterrence and defense a thinkable policy which is recognized as meriting further research, policy studies, and an evaluation.” And for this, he makes a reasonably good case.\n\nBut he must not expect, just for this reason, that the effort to win understanding for his views will be easy going. It goes against the grain of all established strategic thinking. The professional military establishments will brush it off with incredulity, if not with contempt. It will arouse in many circles the same skepticism, and perhaps the same derision, that this reviewer brought down upon himself when he had the temerity to advance somewhat similar ideas in a widely publicized radio lecture delivered over the facilities of the BBC many years ago.\n\nBut the view advanced in this book deserves consideration, if only because of the bankruptcy of all the visible alternatives to it. It might just be that in a world where the devices of long-range military destruction have proliferated beyond all reason, the greatest security any country can hope to have, imperfect as it is, will be found to lie primarily in its confidence in itself, in its readiness to leave other people alone and to go its own way, it its willingness to accept the sort of social discipline that a civilian-based defense implies—in a stance, in other words, that offers minimal incentive to foreign military intrusion but promises to make things difficult, painful, and unprofitable for any power that decides, nevertheless, to intrude. Such principles may not be everywhere applicable. Nowhere may they be the complete answer to the problems at hand. But beggars, in this world of destructive power unlimited, cannot always be choosers. And Mr. Sharp’s approach, certainly more humane and in a small way more hopeful than many others, deserves at least to be given a hearing.\n\nTo see things in this way will require, however, a rather basic change in the view hundreds of millions of people have been taught to take of the sources of national security and of the means by which it may be usefully promoted. The new view would be one that looks primarily inward—to the quality of the respective society, to the character of its institutions, to its social discipline and civic morale, rather than outward to the effectiveness of its armed forces—for the true sources of its strength and its security. It suggests, in Mr. Sharp’s words, “the direct defense of society as such—its principles, free institutions, and liberties—rather than a futile attempt to defend territory as an indirect means to defend the society.” It raises, in fact, the question whether any society can be stronger in relation to others than it is to itself.\n\nWhat is implied here is no less than a change in political philosophy. For it taps, as Mr. Sharp says in his final passages, “a crucial insight into the nature of power”—namely, that\n\nall political power is rooted in and continually dependent upon the co-operation and obedience of the subjects and institutions of the society…. It is indeed possible for whole societies to apply that insight…against internal and foreign aggressors, and to triumph…. With effort, risks, and costs, it is possible for Europeans—and all peoples—to make themselves politically indigestible to would-be tyrants. The process has already begun.\n\nPerhaps those words overstate the case; but if so, not greatly. One ends the reading of the book wondering whether, if this change in political philosophy were to take place, it might not have wider effects than just those that relate to the concepts of national security—whether many other things might not also change, and, in the main, usefully so.\n\nGeorge F. Kennan (1904–2005) was an American diplomat, political scientist and historian. He is best known for his role in shaping US foreign policy during the Cold War and, in particular, for the doctrine of containment. Kennan was Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and served as Ambassador to the USSR in 1952 and as Ambassador to Yugoslavia from 1961 to 1963. His books include At a Century’s Ending and An American Family.",

    "fullText": "The University of Michigan is not firing the woman involved in the \"inappropriate\" relationship with Sherrone Moore.\n\nMoore, the program's football coach, was fired for having an \"inappropriate\" relationship with a female staff member. He was later arrested on criminal trespassing and stalking charges, after learning of his firing. Michigan said in a statement last Wednesday night, December 10, that Moore was being fired immediately.\n\n“When the findings of a university investigation into Coach Moore’s behavior were presented on Wednesday, we immediately terminated his employment,” Grasso wrote in a letter to the university,\" the school's president said.\n\n“There is absolutely no tolerance for this conduct at the University of Michigan. None.”\n\nBut while Moore was fired for having the \"inappropriate\" relationship with the staff member, the woman - who also hid the relationship from the school for months, if not longer - is not being fired.\n\nThe University of Michigan announced that the woman is still employed by the university.\n\nThe school's policy does not apply to her. It only applied to Moore, since he was the person in power, according to USA TODAY.\n\n“Recognizing that Intimate Relationships exist or may develop in the workplace that are not initiated by a Supervisor and are free from coercion and abuse of power, immediate disclosure of the relationship by the Supervisor is required,” the policy states. “Failure of the Supervisor to disclose an Intimate Relationship is a serious offense and cause for discipline, up to and including dismissal from employment.”\n\nThe woman was technically encouraged to share news of the relationship with the school, though she wasn't required to do so.\n\n“Although encouraged, Supervisees have no obligation to disclose,” the policy states.\n\nThe school recognizes that the person in the relationship who has more power at the school has the opportunity to abuse said power. The person without it has less.\n\n“Intimate Relationships initiated by a Supervisor are at high risk of being unwelcomed and experienced by the Supervisee as harassment,” the policy states. “Supervisors are therefore responsible for understanding how their statements and conduct may reasonably be interpreted by persons who do not share their same level of power.”\n\nThe school clearly outlines its rules in Policy No. 201.97.\n\nIt states that a supervisor may not “implicitly or explicitly, initiate or attempt to initiate an intimate relationship with a supervisee.”\n\nSo it was Moore, who has been married for 10 years with three children, that was the one at fault.",

    "description": "Researchers at the University of Warsaw have unveiled a breakthrough method for detecting and precisely calibrating terahertz frequency combs using a quantum antenna made from Rydberg atoms. By combining atomic electrometry with a powerful terahertz-to-light conversion technique, they achieved the first measurement of a single terahertz comb tooth—something previously impossible due to the limits of electronics and optical tools.",
    "fullText": "A research team from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw has introduced a new way to measure hard-to-detect terahertz signals using a \"quantum antenna.\" In their work, the scientists applied an innovative radio wave detection setup based on Rydberg atoms that not only senses terahertz radiation, but also accurately calibrates a so-called frequency comb in this part of the spectrum. Until recently, the terahertz range was considered a blank area in the electromagnetic spectrum, and the method reported in the journal Optica opens the door to extremely sensitive spectroscopy and a new class of room-temperature quantum sensors.\n\nTerahertz (THz) radiation, being part of the electromagnetic spectrum, lies at the boundary of electronics and optics, positioned between microwaves (used, for example, in Wi-Fi) and infrared. Although it holds immense potential for applications that include inspecting packages without harmful X-rays, superspeed 6G communication, and spectroscopy and imaging of organic compounds, turning this potential into precise and sensitive measurements has been technically very difficult. In the past few years, scientists have made major strides in both generating and detecting terahertz radiation, yet until now they had not been able to measure a frequency comb in this region with the required precision.\n\nFrequency combs as ultra-precise electromagnetic rulers\n\nWhy is this so important? Frequency combs, which earned a Nobel Prize in 2005, can be imagined as an incredibly accurate ruler made not from a solid material, but from light or radio waves. Instead of millimeter markings, there is a sequence of evenly spaced lines (\"teeth\") at strictly defined frequencies. This \"electromagnetic ruler\" lets physicists determine the frequency of an unknown signal with extraordinary accuracy simply by seeing which \"tooth\" it matches. Because of this, frequency combs act as reference standards that can be used to calibrate and stabilize many types of instruments over a wide range of frequencies. Depending on where in the electromagnetic spectrum this ruler sits, scientists talk about optical, radio, or terahertz frequency combs.\n\nTerahertz frequency combs are particularly attractive because they can support calibration and highly accurate measurements in a band where the oscillation frequencies are higher than typical radio waves but lower than optical waves (light). However, such combs are notoriously difficult to measure with high precision, since their oscillations are too rapid for conventional electronics and cannot be directly captured with standard optical methods. Researchers have been able to determine the spacing between the comb \"teeth\" and to measure the total power spread across the spectrum, but determining how much power belongs to a single tooth has remained a major challenge.\n\nRydberg atoms turned into quantum antennas\n\nThe scientists from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw have now overcome this obstacle and, for the first time, measured the signal emitted by a single terahertz comb tooth. To achieve this, they employed a gas of rubidium atoms prepared in a Rydberg state. A Rydberg atom is defined as having a single electron excited to a very high orbit by being illuminated with precisely tuned lasers. This \"swollen\" atom acts as a quantum antenna that is extremely sensitive to external electric fields. In addition, by using tunable lasers, the detector can be adjusted to respond to one specific frequency within such a field, across a range that extends up to terahertz waves.\n\nTraditionally, in Rydberg electrometry, the phenomenon of Autler-Townes splitting is used to measure the electric field. Its huge advantage is that the measurement result depends only on fundamental atomic constants, providing an absolutely calibrated readout. Unlike classical antennas, which require laborious calibration in specialized radio laboratories, the atomic-based system is, in a sense, a standard unto itself. Moreover, thanks to the richness of energy states in the atom, such a sensor can be tuned almost continuously over an enormous range, from a direct current (DC) signal up to the aforementioned terahertz.\n\nHybrid terahertz to light conversion for extreme sensitivity\n\nHowever, this method has a limitation: on its own, it is not sensitive enough to record very weak terahertz signals. To remedy this, the research team additionally applied a radio wave-to-light conversion technique invented at the University of Warsaw and adapted it to the needs of terahertz radiation. In this process, the weak terahertz signal is converted into optical photons, which can then be detected with immense sensitivity using single-photon counters. This hybrid approach is the key to success: it combines the extreme sensitivity of photon detection with the ability to \"recover\" the calibration capabilities of the Autler-Townes method even for the weakest signals.\n\nThe sensor based on Rydberg atoms possesses all the features needed to perform precise frequency comb calibration: it can be tuned to a single tooth of the comb, and then retuned to the next, and the next. The scientists managed to observe several dozen teeth in a very wide frequency range this way. Additionally, thanks to the knowledge of the fundamental properties of atoms, the comb was directly calibrated, precisely determining its intensity.\n\nNew path for terahertz metrology and future technologies\n\nThe results obtained by the physicists from the University of Warsaw Wiktor Krokosz, Jan Nowosielski, Bartosz Kasza, Sebastian Borówka, Mateusz Mazelanik, Wojciech Wasilewski, and Michał Parniak represent much more than the development of another sensitive detector. Their work lays the groundwork for a new area of metrology. With the help of Rydberg atoms, the transformative uses of optical frequency combs can now be extended into the previously difficult terahertz region. Importantly, unlike many quantum technologies that require extremely low temperatures, this system functions at room temperature, which greatly lowers costs and makes future commercialization more realistic. This creates an opportunity to build reference measurement standards for the coming generation of terahertz technologies.\n\nThe project \"Quantum Optical Technologies\" (FENG.02.01-IP.05-0017/23) is implemented as part of Measure 2.1 International Research Agendas of the Foundation for Polish Science, co-financed by the European Union from Priority 2 of the European Funds for Modern Economy Programme 2021-2027 (FENG). The research is also one of the results of the SONATA17 and PRELUDIUM23 projects funded by the National Science Centre.)\n\nMaterials provided by University of Warsaw, Faculty of Physics.

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Authorities on Monday had renewed a manhunt for the gunman who killed two students and injured seven more at Brown University over the weekend, after releasing a man who had been held on Sunday as ​a \"person of interest\" in the shooting.\n\nThough officials said late on Sunday they were resuming the search for a suspect, they said there were no ‌credible threats to the community and that they would not reimpose a shelter-in-place order for the campus and the surrounding area that had been lifted earlier.\n\nPolice have released surveillance footage showing the possible shooter ‌dressed in black walking near the building where the attack took place, though his face is not visible.\n\nThe gunman fled after shooting students in a classroom in Brown's Barus & Holley engineering and physics building, where outer doors had been left unlocked while exams were taking place, according to police.\n\nAt a press conference late on Sunday, officials said there had been enough evidence to justify taking into custody the unnamed person of interest, a man in his 20s.\n\nBut Providence Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters the investigation was going in a \"different direction,\" without ⁠offering more detail. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said ‌investigators had determined there was \"no basis to believe that he's a person of interest, so... he's being released.\"\n\nThe mass shooting shook the campus at Brown, one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the United States. The Ivy League school, which has nearly ‍11,000 undergraduate and graduate students, canceled exams and classes for the rest of the year, and the campus was quiet on Sunday as a light snowfall blanketed the city.\n\nThe two students killed were Ella Cook, a sophomore from Mountain Brook, Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, according to statements from various officials.\n\nCook was vice president of the ​school's College Republicans and a \"leading Republican voice at Brown,\" according to an X post from the New York Republicans Club. Her LinkedIn profile included jobs as an ‌ice cream server at a Mountain Brook creamery and a program assistant in New York.\n\n\"Wesley and I join the Mountain Brook community and all of Alabama in mourning the heartbreaking loss of one of our own, Ella Cook, who was senselessly killed over the weekend on Brown University's campus,\" U.S. Senator Katie Britt of Alabama wrote in a statement with her husband, Wesley.\n\nUmurzokov, an aspiring neurosurgeon, was \"the most kind-hearted person,\" according to a GoFundMe campaign set up by his family.\n\n\"He always lent a helping hand to anyone in need without hesitation, and was the most kind-hearted person our family knew,\" the family wrote. \"Our family is incredibly devastated by this loss.\"\n\nHe graduated from Midlothian ⁠High School in Virginia this spring, according to the Washington Post. In a statement, the U.S. ​ambassador to Uzbekistan, Jonathan Henick, mourned \"the loss of his bright future.\"\n\nRef Bari, 22, ​a graduate student at Brown, said he was inside the Barus & Holley building when he heard a series of loud popping sounds that appeared to be gunfire.\n\nBari ran out of the building and asked another student running in the street if he could hide with her ‍and her friends and she agreed. They ⁠returned to her basement apartment and hid in the bathroom.\n\n\"She trusted me,\" he said. \"The only connection between us is we're both students at Brown but beyond that, we don't know each other.\"\n\nTeaching assistant Joseph Oduro, 21, told CNN he was in a classroom that was attacked.\n\n\"The first couple of gunshots went ⁠straight to the chalkboard right where I was standing,\" Oduro said. \"Who knows, if I didn't duck, maybe I'm not here today.\"\n\nA student next to him took two bullets to the leg and was due ‌to undergo surgery on Sunday, he said.",

    "fullText": "One of the students killed in the mass shooting at Brown University is Ella Cook, who was a parishioner at the Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama, the church announced during its Sunday, Dec. 14, service.\n\n\"Many of you heard about the tragedy ... And sadly, tragically, one of those people is one of our parishioners,\" Rev. Craig Smalley said in livestreamed remarks.\n\nSmalley described Cook as a \"bright light\" who was engaged in the church and the broader community, and \"incredibly grounded and generous and faithful.\"\n\nCook's LinkedIn profile indicates that she began attending Brown in 2024.\n\nShe was vice president of the Brown Republicans, according to a social media post from Alex Shieh, who left the school earlier this year amid a furor over his DOGE-inspired \"bloat @ Brown\" campaign.\n\n\"Being a conservative at Brown isn't always the easiest, but Ella was never afraid to share her beliefs on an overwhelmingly liberal campus and support others in doing so,\" Shieh wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"Last spring, while I was under a disciplinary investigation for reporting on Brown's administration for the conservative student paper, almost nobody wanted to be associated with me,\" he added. \"Ella was one of the few who were willing to stand with me in public and help hand out newspapers in front of the dining hall.\"\n\nAlabama U.S. Sen. Katie Britt expressed her condolences to the family of Ella Cook, calling the student’s death “heartbreaking” and “senseless,\" according to reporting from the Montgomery Advertiser.\n\nIn a statement, Britt said she and her husband, Wesley, “joined the Mountain Brook community and all of Alabama in mourning the heartbreaking loss of one of our own, Ella Cook, who was senselessly killed over the weekend on Brown University’s campus.”\n\nShe offered comfort to those who knew Cook, noting that her life was “taken far too soon” and expressing gratitude to law enforcement officials working on the investigation. Britt also asked that Ella’s loved ones and community be kept in prayers during this difficult time.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Dec. 14, WRAL News and the News & Observer, in Raleigh, North Carolina, reported that Kendall Turner, a Brown freshman, is among the injured students.\n\nTurner is an alumnus of Durham Academy in Durham, North Carolina, said an email sent to the school community, according to reports from both outlets.\n\nThe email said that Turner underwent surgery and is now resting in critical but stable condition.

    "fullText": "This article was originally published in Texas Tribune.\n\nThe Texas Education Agency is replacing the elected school boards of the Beaumont, Connally and Lake Worth school districts, Education Commissioner Mike Morath announced Thursday.\n\nState law allows Morath to either close a campus or appoint new leadership if at least one school in the district receives five consecutive failing grades in Texas’ academic accountability system. Each of the districts met that threshold.\n\nPending appeals, the commissioner plans to replace each district’s school board with a state-selected board of managers. Morath will also appoint a conservator with governing authority over current district and campus leaders during the transition, which typically takes several months to complete.\n\nGet stories like this delivered straight to your inbox. \nThe education agency will solicit applications from local community members interested in joining each district’s board of managers. Morath will also appoint superintendents to lead the districts.\n\nThe takeovers add to the growing list of districts subject to state interventions, which also includes two of Texas’ largest: Fort Worth and Houston. The Fort Worth school board has said it plans to appeal the commissioner’s decision, which was announced in October.\n\nThe education agency said in August that five school districts were at risk of intervention after enduring five consecutive years of unsatisfactory ratings. Since then, it has announced plans to take over four of them: Fort Worth, Lake Worth, Connally and Beaumont. Morath has not said whether he plans to intervene in the fifth district, Wichita Falls.\n\nEach of the schools that triggered takeovers in the Beaumont, Connally and Lake Worth districts educates a majority Black and Hispanic student population, and the overwhelming majority of their children come from low-income families.\n\nLake Worth’s Marilyn Miller Language Academy triggered the intervention in that district. In letters informing the districts about the takeovers, Morath noted that during the latest round of accountability ratings, all but one of Lake Worth’s six campuses earned failing grades. Meanwhile, five campuses have received unacceptable ratings for more than a year, while only 22% of students are meeting grade level across all subjects.\n\nLake Worth school district leaders were acutely aware of the challenges facing the school district leading up to the takeover, said Superintendent Mark Ramirez, who was hired this year. Ramirez said the district has focused on addressing the challenges facing each campus, which should serve as a foundation for the incoming board of managers to build upon.\n\n“Our preparation ensures zero instructional loss for our children,” Ramirez said.\n\nThe Connally district had two campuses that met the state’s takeover threshold: Connally Junior High and Connally Elementary. Since the 2022-23 school year, the number of campuses with academically unacceptable scores in the district has doubled, Morath noted. Only 24% of students in the district are meeting grade level. The junior high improved from an F to a D in the most recent ratings.\n\nIn a statement, the Connally district thanked the efforts of Superintendent Jill Bottelberghe in boosting academic performance in recent years but acknowledged the need for improvements.\n\n“We recognize that there is still work that needs to be done,” the statement said. “It is our hope that the appointed Board of Managers will work to not only improve our district’s academic performance, but also serve our community with the same passion and sincerity as our Board of Trustees has.”\n\nML King Middle School and Fehl-Price Elementary in the Beaumont district have also endured five consecutive years of failing grades. The commissioner cited data showing that the elementary school has never earned an acceptable rating, while the middle school has gone 11 years without one. The district has seven campuses with unacceptable ratings for more than a year and has not earned an overall acceptable rating since 2019. Thirty percent of students in the district are meeting grade level.\n\nThomas Sigee Sr., president of the Beaumont school board, said the district had sought to help its struggling campuses — including by partnering with charter schools — but ultimately could not lift them up to state standards. He questioned why the commissioner opted to take over the entire district instead of shutting down the schools.\n\n“We could have closed the schools for a year and facilitated those students to other campuses and go forward,” Sigee said. “I didn’t want the takeover because I knew it would spread chaos in our community.”\n\nIf the decision is finalized, it would mark the second time the state has placed the Beaumont district under its oversight. The education agency did so from 2014-2020 due to financial mismanagement.\n\nEach of the three districts will have opportunities later this month to attend an informal hearing with the commissioner to make their appeals. If Morath stands by his decision to intervene, they can then formally appeal to the State Office of Administrative Hearings.\n\nTakeovers were once rare in Texas, but they have grown more common in the last decade, thanks to the 2015 law that made it easier for the state to step in after five consecutive F grades. It also expanded the commissioner’s ability to initiate special investigations, which could lead to an intervention.\n\nThat A-F grading system is largely based on the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, a standardized exam that lawmakers voted this year to replace in 2027.\n\nBefore 2015, El Paso experienced the only academic takeover in Texas, due to a widespread cheating scandal. Since the law’s passage, the education agency has officially taken over three districts because of low academic performance: Marlin, Shepherd and Houston.\n\nMorath and state-appointed Superintendent Mike Miles believe the Houston ISD intervention was warranted, and they tout as evidence the improved test scores in the two years since it started. Students have improved in every tested subject. None of the district’s campuses received an F on the state’s accountability ratings in the 2024-25 school year, a drastic improvement from the 56 underperforming campuses in 2022-23.\n\nBut the intervention has also run into strong criticism. Teacher departures have skyrocketed. Thousands of students have unenrolled. And improved test scores have sparked concern that the district has accomplished its gains, in part, because of a hyperfocus on testing and moving students into less rigorous math and science classes.\n\nStephen Simpson, Jess Huff and Alex Nguyen contributed to this report.\n\nThis article first appeared on The Texas Tribune.",

    "fullText": "Another mass shooting, another impassioned plea for gun control from Steve Kerr.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors coach spoke for about three minutes unprompted on Sunday night before their 136-131 loss against the Portland Trail Blazers and again called for gun reform in the wake of a mass shooting at Brown University.\n\n“With what happened last night at Brown, it’s just a reminder to me that these shootings continue to happen, and there is something we can do about them. The loss that all of the people involved [Saturday] night, the loss that they’re feeling, it’s exactly the same loss as all the Parkland families, and every other mass shooting.\n\n“Nobody asked me about it today. I didn’t expect anybody to ask me. I doubt we’re gonna do a moment of silence out there because it’s human nature just to not want to deal with this stuff. And it’s human nature just to think, ‘This is so horrible. Let’s not even think about it.’ But we have to think about it.”\n\nSpeaking pregame, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr addresses gun violence following this weekend’s shooting at Brown University.\n\n“We know there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. … I just want people thinking ‘What if it were my child?’”\n\nMore: pic.twitter.com/E2n9z62jYZ\n\n— Sam Gordon (@BySamGordon) December 15, 2025\n\nA shooting took place at Brown University in Rhode Island on Saturday afternoon that left two people dead and nine others injured, according to The New York Times. An investigation is still ongoing. Authorities released a man who they had detained on Sunday night, and are still searching for the alleged gunman.\n\nAccording to the Gun Violence Archive, that was the 389th mass shootings in the United States so far this year. There have been others since.\n\nGun control is something that Kerr has been a strong advocate of for years. He’s spoken out about plenty of other mass shootings in the United States in the past, hosted a town hall about the issue, drawn support for groups founded by students who survived other mass shootings, and more. Kerr’s father, Malcolm, was shot and killed during a terrorist attack in Beirut in 1984 when Steve was a student at Arizona.\n\n“The vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,” Kerr said. “They have every right to own a gun. But it’s on us to decide if we actually want to take action as a country, as citizens. We know, we know that there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. And I just want people out there — it doesn’t matter if you’re Democrat or Republican, or gun owner, non-gun owner — I just want people thinking, ‘What if it were my child? What if it were my brother or sister?’ Would you be willing to stand up to your representatives and say, ‘You know what? Enough. I’m not gonna vote for you unless you are going to stand up for gun violence prevention through common-sense laws that the vast majority of Americans agree on.'\n\n“Or are we just gonna continue to let the gun lobby run us over and not do anything to protect each other, to protect our children, to protect our future. We have to make that decision.”\n\nKerr wasn't alone in the sports world, either. USC women's basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb, who played at Brown, spoke out on Saturday night.\n\n\"It's the guns,\" she said after the Trojans' loss to No. 1 UConn. \"We're the only country that lives this way.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time that Kerr has addressed this issue, and mass shootings continue to occur in the United States. Based on recent history, it likely won't be the last time we hear from Kerr about gun control, either.\n\nWhile Kerr knows how easy it would be to just give up and ignore the problem, especially since it seems like nothing is getting better, he ended his plea on Sunday night with a simple solution.\n\n“Don’t just look the other way, even though that’s human nature and I understand it,” Kerr said. “Think about it. Think about, do you want something done? Do you want your child to go to school terrified every day? Or do you want to actually take action?\n\n“Because that’s what a democracy is about. Where we demand that our representatives protect us. And that option is there. So, we can either just do what we’re continuing to do and let these things happen or make some demands. And so, as you’re thinking about this today, think about, what if it were your own family member?”",

    "fullText": "USC women’s basketball head coach Lindsay Gottlieb opened her postgame news conference after the No. 16 Trojans’ loss to No. 1 UConn on Saturday night with her thoughts on the mass shooting that took place at Brown University.\n\nProvidence police said Sunday morning that they had detained a person of interest after two people were killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting on campus during finals. The person is in their 30s. The shooting happened in an engineering building on campus as people in the area were told to shelter in place for hours afterward as police looked for the shooter.\n\nGottlieb played basketball at Brown and said that she checked her phone after the game to see many text messages about the shooting. She said she felt she needed to address the shooting because it was more important than basketball and that “we can all be better.”\n\n“It doesn’t need to be this way,” Gottlieb said. “Sending thoughts and prayers to my teammates who have kids there. To the parents that have to worry about their children, I’m just going to end it with that, but just to say we’re the only country that lives this way. The college football cycle has been in the news a million times and are we going to report about this? It’s the guns. We’re the only country that lives this way. Parents should not be worried about their kid — I have a teammate who has a daughter who is in the basement of a library because they don’t know what’s going on there. And she’s flying there tomorrow.\"\n\nPolice said the shooter had a handgun and fired more than 40 rounds during the incident. The mayor of Providence, Brett Smiley, said that the building’s outside doors were unlocked but that access to the classrooms where exams were taking place required a badge.\n\nGottlieb has been USC’s coach since 2021 after she spent two seasons as an assistant for the Cleveland Cavaliers following her time as Cal’s head coach. She played at Brown from 1995-99 and immediately got into coaching after her collegiate playing career was over.\n\nUSC lost 79-51 at home to UConn on Saturday night as the Trojans play the season without injured star JuJu Watkins. She injured her knee in the 2025 NCAA tournament before USC fell to UConn in the Elite Eight a season ago. Watkins, who suffered a torn ACL, will miss the entire 2025-26 season.",

    "fullText": "The person of interest detained in connection with the Brown University shooting, identified by law enforcement sources as Benjamin Erickson, is a decorated soldier who had served in a position at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nErickson, a 24-year-old Wisconsin native, served as an infantry soldier in the US Army, where he passed sniper training, had experience with firearms instruction and had served as a rifleman between 2021 and 2024, according to the profile.\n\nErickson also received a good conduct medal, participated in “security duties” near the president and assisted with funeral ceremonies at Arlington, the profile stated.\n\nThe LinkedIn page stated he planned to continue his college education at Brown University in the fall 2025 semester.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Army said Erickson had no deployments and left last year with the rank of specialist. Brown University did not immediately respond to questions about Erickson’s record.\n\nAuthorities said the person of interest was not a current student at Brown, but law enforcement sources indicated to CNN that he might have been recently enrolled.\n\nErickson took online classes with a focus on psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee after graduating from high school in July 2020, and then transferred to Brown for this fall semester after his military service ended, according to the profile, which noted a variety of interests including animal welfare, veteran support and helping the poor.\n\nThe profile further noted that he had interned as a carpenter and helped out at a horse rescue center.\n\nA staff member at the rescue, the Gentle Giants Draft Horse Rescue in Maryland, told CNN that Erickson was part of an Army unit that learned horse handling techniques at the rescue center between 2023 and 2024. Erickson was training with the Caisson Detachment of the US Army’s 3d US Infantry Regiment, the staff member said – a unit that provides escorts for military and state funerals.\n\nA high school yearbook included a photo of Erickson on his school’s wrestling team. A profile on X that appeared to belong to Erickson posted in 2016 and 2017 about wrestling, music and political satire.\n\nOne of Erickson’s former high school classmates, Bryce Jankowski, said he recently exchanged texts with Erickson, who said he was studying at Brown.\n\n“He said he was doing good,” Jankowski said. “He said he was living at a hotel because his apartment flooded,” though he said that did not seem to bother him.\n\nJankowski described Erickson as a well-behaved, smart individual. He did not recall Erickson making any concerning statements, harboring extremist views or having any behavioral challenges. “He was wicked smart.”\n\nAfter high school, he said Erickson had told him that he was in sniper school with the US military.\n\nA former wrestling teammate from high school, who asked not to be quoted by name, described Erickson as a “pretty nice guy, he was quiet… he becomes really outgoing when you get to know him, but he’s pretty quiet when you don’t.”\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, CNN observed the FBI at a Wisconsin home owned by Erickson’s family.\n\nA search of court databases showed no clear criminal history for Erickson aside from a 2023 case in which he was cited for driving on a sidewalk, a charge that was dismissed.\n\nCNN’s Bill Kirkos, Thomas Bordeaux and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Brandon Svaboda scored the go-ahead goal for Boston University men's ice hockey in the third period of Saturday's game.",
    "fullText": "BOSTON – Before the lights went out at Matthews Arena for the last time, they shined brightly on Boston University center Brandon Svoboda.\n\nThe sophomore from Pittsburgh scored two goals including the game-winner at 18:21 of the third to lift the Terriers to a 4-3 victory over Northeastern, on Saturday night. Svoboda’s fourth of the season was the final goal scored at Northeastern’s historic Matthews Arena.\n\nThe Terriers’ victory over the Huskies was the last sporting event played inside Matthews Arena, which officially opened its doors as Boston Arena in April of 1910.\n\n“I got a lucky bounce and I capitalized on it and put it in the back of the net,” said Svoboda. “Playing the last game ever in this building is pretty special and what was it, 1910 this place was built so it was pretty special being the last team playing in this building.\n\n“We are a young group and we are figuring it out so it was obviously a big deal to get a W in the last game in this arena.”\n\nBU improved to 9-8-1 and 6-3-0 in Hockey East going into the semester break while the No. 11 Huskies fell to 10-6-0 and 5-4-0 in the conference.\n\n“It was just a big win for us going into the semester break,” said BU coach Jay Pandolfo. “The first half has not been ideal for us so to finish it that way, to come back in the third period to win a hockey game in this environment, where this is their last home game here and they wanted to win and we found a way to pull it off.”\n\nNortheastern purchased the structure in 1979 and renamed it Matthews Arena three years later. The demolition of the old barn nestled between Mass. Ave and Gainsborough Street will begin in January and the new arena is scheduled to go online in September of 2028.\n\n“Having a new facility is definitely a big selling point,” said NU coach Jerry Keefe. “It is going to have all the amenities you need to develop players and I think this generation of recruits like the shiny and the new.”\n\nThe first Beanpot Tournament was played at Boston Arena in 1952, so it seemed appropriate that Northeastern would play its final game against a neighboring Beanpot opponent. BU played its home games at Boston Arena from 1918 to 1971 before moving into its new facility on Babcock Street.\n\nPandolfo enjoyed many Matthews moments both on the ice and behind the bench. Pandolfo also played in the final Beanpot game at the old Boston Garden.\n\n“I always enjoyed playing here that’s for sure,” Pandolfo said. “It was a fun place to play and I always enjoyed it and I enjoyed coaching there. It is a great environment and a special old building.\n\n“That’s the biggest attachment for me and that I just enjoyed it. My grandfather played at Northeastern, my mom’s dad and that makes it special as well. It was also Boston University’s home rink as well for a long time and that is a big reason we are here closing it out with Northeastern.”\n\nThe Huskies had some extra zip in their blades that created several scoring opportunities, all of which deftly handled by BU netminder Mikhail Yegorov.\n\nNU went up 1-0 on a power play goal by freshman center Jacob Mathieu at 11:28 of the first. Mathieu found an opening outside the BU crease and redirected Giacomo Martino’s wrister from the left circle for his fifth of the season.\n\nNU went up 2-0 at 14:36 when junior center Tyler Fukakusa finished a two-on-one break with his second goal of the season. BU got on the board when Svoboda netted a power play goal at 17:40, his third of the season.\n\n“We were playing fine but we just made some mistakes so to get out of that first period 2-1 was important no question about that,” said Pandolfo.\n\nBU tied the game 2-2 on sophomore center Sacha Boisvert’s second of the season at 13:38 of the second. NU went up 3-2 when sophomore left wing Joe Connor beat the buzzer at 19:59 with his sixth of the season. NU tied the game 3-3 on Kamil Bednarik tally at 18:02 of the third. Svoboda would score 19 seconds later to complete the comeback.\n\n“You give up a late goal at the end of the second period after a power play, that can really hurt you,” said Pandolfo. “But our guys were determined to come back.”",

His face is not visible and investigators said it wasn't clear whether the suspect is a student.\n\nThe suspect was last seen leaving the engineering building and some witnesses told police the suspect, who could be in his 30s, may have been wearing a camouflage mask, Providence Police Deputy Chief Timothy O’Hara said.\n\nUniversity President Christina Paxson said she was told 10 people who were shot were students. Another person was injured by fragments from the shooting but it was not clear if the victim was a student, she said.\n\nThe search for the shooter paralyzed the campus, the nearby neighborhoods filled with stately brick homes and the downtown in Rhode Island's capital city. Streets normally bustling with activity on weekends were eerily quiet.\n\nStudents sheltered in place for hours into the night. Officers in tactical gear led students out of some campus buildings and into a fitness center where they waited. Others arrived at the shelter on buses without jackets or any belongings.\n\nMayor advised people to stay home\n\nInvestigators were not immediately sure how the shooter got inside the first-floor classroom. Outer doors of the building were unlocked but rooms being used for final exams required badge access, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said.\n\nHe encouraged people living near the campus to stay inside or not return home until a shelter-in-place order was lifted.\n\n“The Brown community’s heart is breaking and Providence’s heart is breaking along with it,” Smiley said.\n\nAuthorities believe the shooter used a handgun, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Dan McKee vowed that all resources were being deployed to catch the suspect. Rhode Island has some of the strictest gun laws in the U.S.\n\nNine people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island Hospital, where one was in critical condition. Six required intensive care but were not getting worse and two were stable, hospital spokesperson Kelly Brennan said.\n\nExams were underway during shooting\n\nEngineering design exams were underway when the shooting occurred in the Barus & Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department. The building includes more than 100 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and offices, according to the university’s website.\n\nEmma Ferraro, a chemical engineering student, was in the building’s lobby working on a final project when she heard loud pops coming from the east side. Once she realized they were gunshots, she darted for the door and ran to a nearby building where she sheltered for several hours.\n\nFormer ‘Survivor’ contestant just left the building\n\nEva Erickson, a doctoral candidate who was the runner-up earlier this year on the CBS reality competition show “Survivor,” said she left her lab in the engineering building 15 minutes before shots rang out.\n\nThe engineering and thermal science student shared candid moments on “Survivor” as the show’s first openly autistic contestant. She was locked down in the campus gym following the shooting and shared on social media that the only other member of her lab who was present was safely evacuated.\n\nBrown senior biochemistry student Alex Bruce was working on a final research project in his dorm directly across the street from the building when he heard sirens outside.\n\n“I’m just in here shaking,” he said, watching through the window as armed officers surrounded his dorm.\n\nStudents in a nearby lab turned off the lights and hid under desks after receiving an alert about the shooting, said Chiangheng Chien, a doctoral student in engineering who was about a block away from the scene.\n\nMari Camara, 20, a junior from New York City, was coming out of the library and rushed inside a taqueria to seek shelter. She spent more than three hours there, texting friends while police searched the campus.\n\n“Everyone is the same as me, shocked and terrified that something like this happened,” she said.\n\nBrown, the seventh oldest higher education institution in the U.S., is one of the nation’s most prestigious colleges with roughly 7,300 undergraduates and more than 3,000 graduate students. Tuition, housing and other fees run to nearly $100,000 per year, according to the university.",

All currently enrolled students are receiving individualized advising and teach-out plans to ensure timely degree completion.\n\nThe degree programs being dropped effective fall 2026 include:\n\nThe Africana Studies major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Chemistry major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Classics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Community Health Education major within the Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nThe Dance and Dance Studies majors within the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.\n\nThe Earth Science majors within both the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science Education degrees.\n\nThe French major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Horticulture major within the Bachelor of Applied Horticulture degree, and the Horticulture Technology major within the Associate of Applied Science degree.\n\nThe Life Science major and the Life Science/Chemistry major within the Bachelor of Science Education degrees.\n\nThe Mathematics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Physical Science major within the Bachelor of Science Education degree.\n\nThe Physics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Radiologic Technology major within the Associate of Technical Study degree.\n\nThe Respiratory Care major within the Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nThe School Health Education major within the Bachelor of Science Education degree.\n\nKent State will continue to offer related degrees or credentials in several areas under different program headings, according to university officials. For example, the Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics will sunset, but the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics continues to serve students in that field of study.\n\nFor Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Radiologic Technology, the university will maintain other degree options at the associate or bachelor’s degree level.\n\nFor Africana Studies, Classics, Dance, Earth Science, French and Horticulture, the university will continue to offer undergraduate minors or certificates.\n\nKent State also will maintain teacher education bachelor’s degree programs in science and health fields that align with the inactivated programs.\n\nThe board also approved a strategic partnership with NEOMED Clinical Services LLC to take over Kent State's student health services.\n\nThe board authorized the university to enter into a lease and health center services agreement with NEOMED Clinical Services, establishing a collaborative arrangement to provide comprehensive clinical care and preventive services on campus.\n\nNEOMED occupies about 10,500 square feet of space on the lower floor of the DeWeese Health Center to provide expanded clinical services, health education and outreach programs.\n\nThe three-year agreement begins July 1, 2026, with the option for two one-year renewals. NEOMED will provide all staffing for the health center services and will work cooperatively with Kent State’s Division of People, Culture and Belonging to offer retention to qualified employees.\n\nIn addition, the board approved a Student Health Fee effective fall 2026. Full-time undergraduate and graduate students will be assessed $90 per semester, while part-time students will pay $35 per semester.\n\nThe fee excludes College Credit Plus students, students enrolled in fully online programs, dissertation students and students enrolled at the College of Podiatric Medicine.\n\nIn other business, the board approved a six-year comprehensive capital plan for Fiscal Years 2027-32, identifying campus upgrade projects that are the most important to the institution.\n\nThe plan primarily includes projects funded by state capital appropriations and does not list projects solely financed by local funding or philanthropy.\n\nThe Ohio Office of Budget and Management requires that each state college submit a six-year capital plan.\n\nProjects for the first two years of the plan include:\n\nThe third phase of the renovation of White Hall on the Kent Campus will replace antiquated heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment to the remaining floors along with planned classroom and interior building improvements.\n\nTower renovations in University Library on the Kent Campus.\n\nContinued critical deferred maintenance of the aging infrastructure on the Kent Campus.\n\nInformation technology network access enhancements in academic buildings on the Kent Campus.\n\nThe second phase of Purinton Hall classroom renovations on the East Liverpool Campus.\n\nMain Classroom Building HVAC replacement on the Salem Campus.\n\nThe second phase of central chiller plant replacement on the Stark Campus.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Record-Courier: Kent State will eliminate 19 undergrad programs in fall 2026",

    "fullText": "In speculative decoding (for autoregressive models), we speed up generation by using a smaller model to generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a larger model.\nThe core idea is that most tokens are easily predictable; thus, we should be able to use a smaller and faster model for them.\nThe classic example is the following sentence:\n\n“Geoffrey Hinton did his PhD at the University ___ ___”.\n\nA small model can predict the next word “of” with high confidence, while the next token “Edinburgh” is much harder, requiring a larger model to verify.\n\nLanguage diffusion models sort-of have something analogous to speculative decoding built-in by default (and in some ways, a better version).\n\nFor diffusion language models with confidence-aware parallel decoding1, the model generates all tokens above a given confidence threshold at each step. Thus, “easy” tokens are generated in parallel.\nSome ways in which this is better than speculative decoding is that it is global (works across the entire context, not just for the next K tokens) and doesn’t require running two separate models.\nIn the following example:\n\nRepeat the word grape over and over again.\n\na diffusion language model could generate the prediction “grape” for the entire context length in one step, while in speculative decoding, even if the entire sequence is easily predictable, it can only predict K tokens at a time (typically around 4-8, from what I’ve read).\n\nThis benefit of increased parallel decoding partially depends on the structuredness of a text, which exists on a spectrum. An increase in confidence per output token directly leads to more tokens being decoded on average per step.1\n\nIncreased structure -> reduced entropy -> increased confidence -> higher parallel decoding\n\nThe grape example above is trivially structured, while normal text generation is unstructured and high entropy. Writing code (an actually useful domain) is somewhere in between.\n\nI had a large hunch that for structured tasks (like coding), the average number of tokens generated in parallel per step is higher than in normal text generation, and monotonically increases with the amount of structuredness present in the domain of the output.\n\nI recall reading that Google Gemini was much closer to state of the art for code generation than it was for reasoning tasks when it was first released. Perhaps this improvement for structured tasks is a general motif when it comes to these models?\n\nI threw together a small test and used the model from the paper Fast dLLM v2 (available on Huggingface) to generate roughly 256 tokens for 10 different prompts (each ran 10 times on A100s with an additional 2 generations for warmup):\n\nThe code for everything can be found here, which additionally includes generated output and metadata for each run. Below are the results:\n\nAs predicted, the grape example was dramatically faster than the unstructured text. What was surprising was how much faster (2.33 times speedup!) code generation was compared to unstructured text, even across multiple examples.\n\nMore testing should be done, but I imagine that there is a negative correlation between relative speedup and program complexity, and that boiler plate code (ex. self.input = input) would have a higher speedup compared to logic-heavy sections.\n\nAnother interesting result was that generating the start of the Declaration of Independence, a document which the model must have memorized, didn’t have much speedup. This tiny ablation study suggests that it really is the structuredness of the output, not memorization, which matters.\n\nThis was a small test thrown together in under an hour, and more rigorous evaluations should be done, but these preliminary results hint that this idea might be true to some degree.\n\nAn important limitation to address: In autoregressive decoding, we constrained decoding where we set all syntactically invalid tokens to have a probability of zero, ensuring that we are only generating text which follows some rules (JSON formatting, syntactically correct code, etc). For diffusion language models, this can’t naively be applied. However, similar to figuring out KVCache reuse with the advent of KVCache approximation, we might find a practical solution to this problem.2\n\nRead the section “Confidence-Aware Parallel Decoding” in the paper, Fast-dLLM. ↩︎ ↩︎\n\nThere are lots of papers of doing semi-autoregressive generation using diffusion language models. See AR-Diffusion, Fast-dLLM, Block Diffusion, etc. ↩︎",

But we've proven with this research that even individuals with higher bone mineral density are able to float successfully in water.”:: The BSAStatistics show Black children in England are three times more likely to drown than white children.“...we know that 96% of adults in England do not swim regularly. We know that water safety isn't prioritized in schools and local swimming clubs and in after-school programs either. So when we're looking at the broader picture of things, Black and Asian communities face a higher risk of drowning.'':: The BSAThe study found with proper instructions ninety percent of participants could float successfully for two minutes.Body composition analysis assessed factors that affect buoyancy, and tested different floating techniques.The results indicated body fat percentage, rather than bone density, is a factor in buoyancy, though not the sole determinant of one's ability to float.Jones says the way Britain teaches floating needs to change from a one method for all approach.''Floating is unique and bespoke to everybody, depending on their unique body composition.''''But as long as your face is up and you are breathing and you are safe and you are able to keep your airways open and receive oxygen, you are floating.'':: The BSAThe BSA hopes the research will help improve attitudes to swimming in Black and Asian communities and encourage more people to learn how to float.",

The Justice Department continued to hold onto those files and conducted searches of them this fall, without a new warrant, as they prepared a case charging Comey with lying to Congress five years ago.\n\nRichman alleged that the Justice Department violated his Fourth Amendment rights by retaining his records and by conducting new warrantless searches of the files, prompting Kollar-Kotelly to issue an order last week temporarily barring prosecutors from accessing the files as part of its investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department said the request for the return of the records was merely an attempt to impede a new prosecution of Comey, but the judge again sided with Richman in a 46-page order Friday that directed the Justice Department to give him back his files.\n\n“When the Government violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by sweeping up a broad swath of a person’s electronic files, retaining those files long after the relevant investigation has ended, and later sifting through those files without a warrant to obtain evidence against someone else, what remedy is available to the victim of the Government’s unlawful intrusion?” the judge wrote.\n\nOne answer, she said, is to require the government to return the property to the rightful owner.\n\nThe judge did, however, permit the Justice Department to file an electronic copy of Richman's records under seal with the Eastern District of Virginia, where the Comey investigation has been based, and suggested prosecutors could try to access it later with a lawful search warrant.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges that Comey used Richman to share information with the news media about his decision-making during the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Prosecutors charged the former FBI director in September with lying to Congress by denying that he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source for the media.\n\nThat indictment was dismissed last month after a federal judge in Virginia ruled that the prosecutor who brought the case, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. But the ruling left open the possibility that the government could try again to seek charges against Comey, a longtime foe of President Donald Trump. Comey has pleaded not guilty, denied having made a false statement and accused the Justice Department of a vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Comey saga has a long history.\n\nIn June 2017, one month after Comey was fired as FBI director, he testified that he had given Richman a copy of a memo he had written documenting a conversation he had with Trump and had authorized him to share the contents of the memo with a reporter.\n\nAfter that testimony, Richman permitted the FBI to create an image, or complete electronic copy, of all files on his computer and a hard drive attached to that computer. He authorized the FBI to conduct a search for limited purposes, the judge noted.\n\nThen, in 2019 and 2020, the FBI and Justice Department obtained search warrants to obtain Richman's email accounts and computer files as part of a media leak investigation that concluded in 2021 without charges. Those warrants were limited in scope, but Richman has alleged that the government collected more information than the warrants allowed, including personal medial information and sensitive correspondence.\n\nIn addition, Richman said the Justice Department violated his rights by searching his files in September, without a new warrant, as part of an entirely separate investigation.\n\n“The Court further concludes that the Government’s retention of Petitioner Richman’s files amounts to an ongoing unreasonable seizure,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote. “Therefore, the Court agrees with Petitioner Richman that the Government has violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.”",

    "description": "His reporting on a Stanford University president put Theo Baker on the map, but his upcoming book may cement his reputation as the rare young journalist willing to challenge Silicon Valley's startup machine.",
    "fullText": "Theo Baker is truly an outlier.\n\nWhile journalism as a major has seen shrinking enrollment for years and is even being dropped by some schools entirely, Baker, a senior at Stanford University, has doubled down on old-school investigative reporting, and it is paying off spectacularly.\n\nBaker first made headlines as a college freshman when his reporting for The Stanford Daily led to the resignation of Stanford president Marc Tessier-Lavigne. After uncovering allegations of research misconduct spanning two decades, Baker — just one month into college — found himself “receiving anonymous letters, conducting stakeouts, and tracking down confidential sources,” according to his publisher. Meanwhile, high-powered lawyers tried to discredit his work. By year’s end, Tessier-Lavigne had resigned, and Baker became the youngest-ever recipient of the George Polk Award, one of journalism’s most prestigious honors.\n\nShortly after, Warner Bros. and famed producer Amy Pascal won a competitive auction for the film rights to his story.\n\nBut if that scandal put Baker on the map, his upcoming book may cement his reputation as the rare young journalist willing to challenge Silicon Valley’s startup machine.\n\n“How to Rule the World,” out May 19 — three weeks before he graduates — promises an explosive look at how venture capitalists treat Stanford students as “a commodity,” wooing favored undergrads with slush funds, shell companies, yacht parties, and funding offers before they even have business ideas in their hunt for the next trillion-dollar founder.\n\n“I watched in real time as my peers were taught to cut corners and plied with enormous wealth by people who wanted to exploit their talent,” Baker, who turns 21 next month, tells Axios. Drawing on more than 250 interviews with students, CEOs, VCs, Nobel laureates, and three Stanford presidents, the book aims to expose what Baker describes to Axios as a “weird, money-soaked subculture that has so much influence over the rest of the world.”\n\nIt’s perhaps an unsurprising move from someone who grew up around top journalists. His father is New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker, and his mother is The New Yorker’s Susan Glasser. While his peers chase venture capital funding and six-figure startup salaries, Baker spent his sophomore year reporting and took his junior year off to write, including two months at the Yaddo writers’ retreat.\n\nThat choice becomes even more striking against the backdrop of journalism’s current struggles. While traditional journalism programs fail to fill classes and media outfits face seemingly relentless layoffs, Baker represents something both exciting and increasingly uncommon: a star student betting his career on accountability journalism. Whether he’s a harbinger of renewed interest in investigative reporting remains to be seen, but we’d guess his book will capture the attention of plenty of college students — and it will almost certainly make waves in Silicon Valley while doing it.",

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Catch by catch, Kyle Pitts Sr. put the mistake-prone Atlanta Falcons on his back and carried them to a thrilling comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThursday night got even better for the fifth-year pro when the former University of Florida star learned his 11-reception, 166-yard, three-touchdown performance that keyed a 29-28 win was the most productive game by an NFL tight end in nearly three decades.\n\nThe previous tight end to finish with at least 10 catches, 150 yards receiving and three TDs in a game was Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in 1996.\n\nThe 25-year-old Pitts noted he wasn't even born yet back then.\n\n“Man, I love the state of Florida,” the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Pitts said as he stepped up to the podium in the visiting interview room at Raymond James Stadium.\n\n“It means a lot,” he added about the mention of Sharpe. “It's a great person to be (compared to).”\n\nKurt Cousins targeted Pitts a team-high 12 times, leaning heavily on the young tight end with leading receiver Drake London out with a knee injury. Pitts scored on receptions of 8, 17 and 7 yards, the latter trimming what had once been a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 28-26 with 3:34 remaining.\n\nHis last catch, on third-and-28 from the Atlanta 29, was for 14 yards. Cousins threw 21 yards to David Sills V on fourth-and-14 to set up Zane Gonzalez's 43-yard game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n“It was the plan, you know, all along. Kyle is our guy,” second-year Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. “You're down a couple of your guys like Drake, some of those guys, and Kyle has really filled in that role and become the lead dog guy. He has done an awesome job.”\n\nThe Falcons (5-9) are eliminated from playoff contention, but they relished the opportunity to play spoiler against the division-rival Bucs (7-7), who are trying to win the NFC South for the fifth straight season.\n\n“It's amazing. I mean, we've been having our ups and downs through the year,” Pitts said. “Obviously, it's not fun being eliminated early, but we're resilient. ... It was just pretty fun to get that win.”\n\nThe Falcons overcame a team-record 19 penalties for 125 yards. They also withstood a wide-open Sills dropping what would have been a go-ahead TD catch in the third quarter, as well as Bijan Robinson's third-quarter fumble that led to the touchdown that put Tampa Bay up by two scores early in the fourth.\n\n“It's a steppingstone to where we want to go,” Morris said. “We talked about this, building blocks for what we've got to do. What we're talking about is next year. ... Only thing we can do right now is finish.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Police in Michigan have issued a statement providing some details about why former University of Michigan Head Coach Sherrone Moore was taken into custody on December 10. However, even as Moore's career imploded and he, at least temporarily, lost his freedom, he still stands to potentially earn millions.\n\nWhat was Moore's salary? \"Moore's buyout was listed at $13.89 million. That number is the second-lowest among all listed coaches from the Big Ten,\" CBS News reported. According to USA Today, his total salary was $6.11 million, making him the 40th top-paid college football coach.\n\nIt was a whirlwind of developments, as the university announced it had fired Moore. Then, ESPN reported that he detained by police, a fact that was documented by jail records showing Moore, 39, confined to a Michigan jail. Now, police have finally provided some details about what is going on. Moore was ousted after \"credible evidence\" emerged that he \"engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,\" the university said, according to USA Today.\n\nBecause of the manner in which Moore was ousted (right before he was detained), it's not clear whether he will get the full buyout amount, according to CBS News.\n\n\"Michigan could be off the hook for some (or all) of his buyout, though cases like this have ended in court battles in the past,\" the network wrote.\n\nThe ex-coach stood to make a lot more money if he wasn't fired. \"Moore's contract at Michigan was set to pay $5.5 million in base salary and additional compensation annually through the 2029 season -- with a $500,000 retention bonus each season,\" wrote CBS News.\n\nTwo police departments were involved in taking Moore into custody, both Saline and Pittsfield Township, both in Michigan.\n\nAccording to ESPN, police \"responded at 4:10 p.m. to the 3000 block of Ann Arbor Saline Road.\" What happened? It was \"for the purposes of investigating an alleged assault. ... A suspect in this case was taken into custody. This incident does not appear to be random in nature, and there appears to be no ongoing threat to the community,\" added ESPN.\n\nSaline police had previously told ESPN that they \"assisted in locating and detaining former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore. Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges.\"\n\nMoore is married with three kids. He has been the head coach of the University of Michigan since 2022.\n\n\"The suspect was lodged at the Washtenaw County Jail pending review of charges by the Washtenaw County Prosecutor,\" the statement continued, according to ESPN. \"At this time, the investigation is ongoing. Given the nature of the allegations, the need to maintain the integrity of the investigation, and its current status at this time, we are prohibited from releasing additional details.\"\n\n\"Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,\" Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement. \"Following a university investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and UM maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.\"",

Police were called to investigate an alleged assault in Pittsfield Township.\n\n\"U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,\" Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement to the media. \"Following a University investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.

There is a $13.89 million buyout but his firing could void the amount, CBS Sports reported.\n\nBiff Poggi, 66, was appointed interim head football coach.\n\nMichigan (9-3) is scheduled to play Texas (9-3) in the Citrus Bowl on Dec. 31 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla. Last year, Michigan went 7-5 during the regular season and beat Alabama in the ReliaQuest Bowl in Tampa, Fla., on New Year's Eve.\n\nPoggi returned to Michigan as offensive coordinator and also filled in when Moore served a university-imposed suspension for games against Central Michigan and Nebraska in a sign-stealing saga. Moore was to be suspended for the first game of the 2026 season as a continuation of his punishment for the scouting scandal involving former staffer Connor Stalions.\n\nMoore was suspended for one game in the 2023 season as part of a self-imposed penalty for a recruiting violation.\n\nMoore had been on Jim Harbaugh's staff since 2018.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 18 days after Michigan won the national title, Moore replaced Harbaugh, who went to the NFL Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nDuring the championship season, he was the interim coach for the Wolverines for the final three games as Harbaugh served a suspension for his role in the sign-stealing saga.\n\nBefore coming to Michigan, Moore worked on Central Michigan's staff.\n\nUniversity of Michigan Regents in January 2022 fired President Mark Schlissel after an investigation found inappropriate conduct with an employee.\n\nDomenico Grasso became interim president in May after the resignation of Santa Ono, who was announced as the University's Florida president but the state board rejected his candidacy.",

He was the University of Michigan’s first African American head coach.\n\nMoore has a wife, to whom he’s been married since 2015, and three daughters.\n\nAssociate coach Biff Poggi has been named as the University of Michigan’s interim head football coach.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines finished the regular season at 9-3 and have a game against the Texas Longhorns at the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl on December 31.\n\nDave Portnoy, the founder of sports and pop culture media company Barstool Sports, commended the University of Michigan’s decision to fire Moore.\n\n“On a serious note there have been a lot of schools over the years who have looked the other way with scandals. I’d just like to say I’m proud that Michigan refused to do the same,” Portnoy wrote on X Wednesday.\n\n“Sherrone broke the moral code and it cost him his job. It’s a hard lesson but it’s the Michigan Man Way. Leaders and best for a reason. Proud to be a Michigan Wolverine tonight.”\n\nMoore was also part of a sign-stealing scandal, which resulted in record fines expected to exceed $20 million imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association on the University of Michigan.\n\nSign-stealing is when a sports team decodes an opponent’s hand signals. The NCAA bans schools from sending scouts to future opponents’ games and using electronic equipment to record signals.\n\nMoore was given a three-game suspension for his role in the scheme, which he was expected to complete next year. Reports of the NCAA’s investigation surfaced early in the 2023 season, when Moore was working under Jim Harbaugh.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines came out on top in the 2023 season, winning the College Football Playoff national championship in a game against the Washington Huskies.\n\nPoggi successfully led the Michigan Wolverines for two games this year while Moore was suspended.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Tuesday said he will not intervene to stop the execution of Harold Wayne Nichols.\n\nNichols, 64, is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Thursday for the 1988 rape and murder of Karen Pulley, a 20-year-old student at Chattanooga State University.\n\nNichols confessed to killing Pulley as well as raping several other women in the Chattanooga area. Although he expressed remorse at trial, he admitted that he would have continued his violent behavior had he not been arrested. He was sentenced to death in 1990.\n\nNichols’ attorneys had sought to have his sentence commuted to life in prison, citing the fact that he took responsibility for his crimes and pleaded guilty. His clemency petition stated “he would be the first person to be executed for a crime he pleaded guilty to since Tennessee re-enacted the death penalty in 1978.”\n\nIn a statement emailed late on Tuesday, Lee said, “After deliberate consideration of Harold Wayne Nichols’ request for clemency, and after a thorough review of the case, I am upholding the sentence of the State of Tennessee and do not plan to intervene.”\n\nIn a recent interview, Pulley’s sister, Lisette Monroe, said the wait for Nichols’ execution has been “37 years of hell.” She described her sister as “gentle, sweet and innocent,” and said she hopes that after the execution she’ll be able to focus on the happy memories of Pulley instead of her murder.\n\nNichols' attorneys issued a statement saying they are “deeply saddened and gravely disappointed” by Lee's decision to deny clemency.\n\n“Wayne has spent decades taking accountability for his actions, working to transform his life, and being an extraordinary person who is loved and trusted by correctional officers, faith leaders, and many in his community,\" they wrote.\n\nNichols broke into Pulley’s home, raped her and beat her on the head with a 2-by-4 board. Pulley suffered massive brain injuries and died the next day.\n\nNichols was arrested several months after Pulley's murder for unrelated rapes and burglaries in the Chattanooga area. He confessed to raping several victims in Chattanooga over a two-month period prior to Pulley's slaying. He pleaded guilty to the rapes for two victims, but went to jury trial for two others and was convicted.",

    "title": "Sources: University of Utah nearing landmark private equity deal expected to generate $500 million",
    "description": "The new venture would generate a massive amount of money for the school in a groundbreaking move that may pave the way for more schools and conferences to do the same.",
    "fullText": "Private equity has officially arrived in college athletics.\n\nThe University of Utah is on the cusp of striking the industry’s first partnership with an equity firm in a marriage that features a nine-figure capital infusion and the creation and shared ownership of a for-profit entity to operate athletics business and financial elements outside of the traditional university framework.\n\nThe new venture is expected to generate as much or more than $500 million in capital — a groundbreaking and innovative move that may pave the way for more schools and conferences to pursue such a concept.\n\nFinalization of the project is expected soon pending authorization on Tuesday from the University of Utah Board of Trustees. The board is granting the university permission to move forward with the agreement with Otro Capital, a New York-based sports private equity firm.\n\nMultiple officials with knowledge of the project spoke to Yahoo Sports under condition of anonymity.\n\nThe endeavor with Otro Capital is more than just a nine-figure infusion of cash.\n\nAt the center of the project is the creation of a private, independent offshoot of the athletic department — Utah Brands & Entertainment LLC — in a first-of-its-kind partnership between a university athletic department and an equity partner. An executive team from Otro Capital, combined with athletics department personnel, will lead the creation and operation of the new company, which will live within the university’s foundation.\n\nThe university retains majority ownership and decision-making authority of Utah Brands & Entertainment. Otro marries the capital infusion with a team of experienced operators. A president from outside the university will preside over the company and report to a board, chaired by Utah athletic director Mark Harlan, with seats for trustees and Otro executives.\n\nThe project includes a fascinating wrinkle. The university is offering a prominent group of donors the ability to purchase a stake in Utah Brands & Entertainment. Already, university officials have culled a small donor base to generate millions in purchase agreements. The more than $500 million capital figure includes both the nine-figure cash infusion from Otro as well as those capital commitments from donors.\n\nUtah Brands & Entertainment will house most of the components traditionally held within the university’s athletic department, including many athletic personnel and divisions. However, fundraising will remain with the school.\n\nThe new company’s primary goal is to generate more revenue across an assortment of areas, including ticketing, concessions, corporate sales and sponsorships. Charged with overseeing and operating the revenue-share pay system for Utah athletes, the new entity provides the department with more flexibility and freedom considering it will operate separate from a public university.\n\nThe move isn’t completely foreign to college sports. Over the last several months, a host of schools — Kentucky, Michigan State, Clemson — have announced the creation of a private, revenue-generating entity outside of the athletic department as college sports evolves into a more professionalized ecosystem. None of those schools have partnered with an equity firm. However, Michigan State announced its own capital infusion of sorts in the form of a $401 million donation, a portion of which will go toward its new athletics entity.\n\nAs for Utah’s partnership, in exchange for the upfront cash, Otro will earn a large percentage of annual revenues generated from Utah Brands & Entertainment as it splits funds with the university. An exit strategy — in five to seven years — exists, and the university holds the right to purchase Otro’s ownership stake.\n\nThe emergence of private equity in college sports is a long time coming.\n\nFor the last two years, as university athletic departments face mounting financial stressors, dozens of schools pursued private capital or equity deals, including conferences as a whole — most notably the Big 12 and Big Ten. However, when these projects reached the finish line, they were stymied for various reasons.\n\nFor instance, Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark has twice presented such a deal before his presidential board. Big Ten officials nearly reached the point of a vote on a $2.4 billion capital deal before at least two schools — USC and Michigan — scuttled the project.\n\nYormark’s pursuit of a capital deal caught the attention of Harlan and Utah administrators, who, more than two years ago, began the process that resulted in the potential deal with Otro.\n\nAccording to its website, Otro seeks to invest in “sports teams, leagues and ecosystem businesses with strong intellectual property.” The company was founded in 2023 by partners Alec Scheiner, Niraj Shah, Brent Stehlik and Isaac Halyard, who all served as senior executives at RedBird Capital Partners, one of the globe’s largest sports industry investors.\n\nScheiner has a deep background as a sports investor and team executive, spending time as president of the Cleveland Browns and senior vice president of the Dallas Cowboys. He was the point man for Legends Hospitality, a corporation providing food, merchandise, retail and stadium operations for venues and companies worldwide. Stehlik was the previous president of OneTeam Partners and worked as a chief revenue officer for the Browns.\n\nOtro’s portfolio includes the Formula 1 Alpine Racing team, FlexWork Sports marketing and event company and Two Circles, a fan and data analytics platform. Otro will own a large share — but not a majority share — of Utah Brands & Entertainment, similar to its other projects. For instance, Otro invested $200 million in Alpine Racing to own a 24% equity stake.\n\nAccording to a 2024 story on buyoutinsider.com, Otro was targeting $500 million for a sports-focused investment fund. The company has pitched its college plan to other schools — one specifically in the Big Ten — before Utah expressed serious interest.\n\nIt’s unclear if Otro has plans to execute similar agreements with other schools.\n\nIn Salt Lake City, Otro executives, charged with revenue-generating goals, will have access to the school’s trademark and licensing rights, facilities, sponsorships and the university’s teams. However, decisions around coaching staff and player acquisition remain with university personnel.\n\nIn fact, the school cleared the partnership with NCAA officials. To remain under the NCAA’s umbrella, Utah’s university president and athletic director must retain the majority of decision-making.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge has allowed a Tufts University student from Turkey to resume research and teaching while she deals with the consequences of having her visa revoked by the Trump administration, leading to six weeks of detention.\n\nThe arrest of Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying children's relationship to social media, was among the first as the Trump administration began targeting foreign-born students and activists involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy. She had co-authored an op-ed criticizing her university’s response to Israel and the war in Gaza. Caught on video in March outside her Somerville residence, immigration enforcement officers took her away in an unmarked vehicle.\n\nÖztürk has been out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center since May and back on the Tufts campus. But she's been unable to teach or participate in research as part of her studies because of the termination of her record in the government's database of foreign students studying temporarily in the U.S.\n\nIn her ruling Monday, Chief U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper wrote that Öztürk is likely to succeed on claims that the termination was “arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and in violation of the First Amendment.”\n\nGovernment argued that termination was legal\n\nThe government’s lawyers unsuccessfully argued that the Boston federal court lacked jurisdiction and that Öztürk’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record (SEVIS) record was terminated legally after her visa was revoked, making her eligible for removal proceedings.\n\n“There’s no statute or regulation that’s been violated by the termination of the SEVIS record in this case,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter said during a hearing last week. The Associated Press sent an email Tuesday seeking comment from Sauter on whether the government plans to appeal.\n\nIn a statement, Öztürk, who plans to graduate next year, said while she is grateful for the court's decision, she feels “a great deal of grief” for the education she has been “arbitrarily denied as a scholar and a woman in my final year of doctoral studies.”\n\n“I hope one day we can create a world where everyone uses education to learn, connect, civically engage and benefit others — rather than criminalize and punish those whose opinions differ from our own,” said Öztürk, who is still challenging her arrest and detention.\n\nThe then-30-year-old was one of four students who wrote the opinion piece in the campus newspaper. It criticized the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nÖztürk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends in March for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan, according to her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai. Her student visa had been revoked several days earlier, but she was not informed of that, her lawyers said. The government asserted that terminating her SEVIS record two hours after her arrest was a proper way of informing Tufts University about her visa revocation.\n\nA State Department memo said Öztürk's visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions “‘may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization’ including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”\n\nÖztürk running out of time to pursue teaching, research goals\n\nWithout her SEVIS status reinstated, Öztürk said she couldn't qualify as a paid research assistant and couldn't fully reintegrate into academic life at Tufts.\n\n“We have a strange kind of legal gaslighting here, where the government claims it’s just a tinkering in a database, but this is really something that has a daily impact on Ms. Öztürk’s life,” her attorney, Adriana Lafaille of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in court.\n\n“We are running out of time to make this right. Each day that goes by is a day that she is being prevented from doing the work that she loves in the graduate program that she came here to be part of. Each day that this happens is a day that the government is allowed to continue to punish her for her protected speech.”\n\nÖztürk, meanwhile, has maintained a full course load and fulfilled all requirements to maintain her lawful student status, which the government hasn't terminated, her lawyer said.\n\nRecord created to collect information on international students\n\nSEVIS is mandated by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and administered by the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement “to collect information relating to nonimmigrant foreign students” and “use such information to carry out the enforcement functions of” ICE.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, when a SEVIS record is terminated, a student loses all on and/ or off-campus employment authorization and allows ICE agents to investigate to “confirm the departure of the student.”\n\nMcCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.",

    "description": "Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis show that psychedelic compounds such as psilocybin appear to distort the link between blood flow and brain-cell functioning, which scientists use to track brain activity.",
    "fullText": "Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug with promising clinical applications for treating mood disorders and substance abuse disorders. Recent work in functional MRI (fMRI) studies show that psychedelics can reset brain network activity — and it is thought that this effect, which can linger for days, might explain its therapeutic benefits.\n\nPsychedelics such as psilocybin act on a chemical in the brain called serotonin that controls the relaxation and contraction of blood vessels. Because fMRI uses changes in blood flow and blood oxygen levels in the brain as a proxy for brain activity, a team of WashU Medicine researchers set out to determine if these signals remained an accurate measure of brain activity in subjects dosed with a similar psychedelic that acts on the same chemicals.\n\nThey observed, in mice given this drug, that blood flow did not change as it normally would in relation to the activity of brain cells called neurons. When combined with a second medication that blocks a specific receptor in the brain that responds to serotonin, the blood flow effects from the psychedelic drug were removed.\n\nThe team’s subsequent studies using psilocybin in mice produced similar results to those observed with the first drug. Reanalyzing results from an earlier fMRI study in human subjects given psilocybin revealed similar effects on brain responses.\n\nThese results have important implications for how researchers interpret fMRI scans of brain activity in people who have taken psychedelics, and they may aid the scientific search for how psychedelics achieve their potential therapeutic effects.\n\nThe research was led by Adam Q. Bauer, an associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis’ Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology; Jordan G. McCall, an associate professor of anesthesiology in the Center for Clinical Pharmacology; and Joshua S. Siegel, MD, PhD, who conducted the work at WashU Medicine and is now an assistant professor at New York University. The study was published in Nature Neuroscience.\n\nTogether, the results from mice and humans indicate that the neurovascular effects of psychedelics need to be better understood when interpreting blood flow-dependent neuroimaging. As compounds like psilocybin are increasingly studied for treating conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder, treatment-resistant depression, substance abuse and stroke, understanding how psychedelics affect the reliability of brain scans as a proxy for brain activity is important for clinicians and researchers examining the effects of these drugs.",
