    "description": "Catch by catch, Kyle Pitts Sr. put the mistake-prone Atlanta Falcons on his back and carried them to a thrilling comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  Thursday night got even better for the fifth-year pro when the former University of Florida star learned his 11-reception, 166-yard, three-touchdown performance that keyed a 29-28 win was the most productive game by an NFL tight end in nearly three decades.

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Catch by catch, Kyle Pitts Sr. put the mistake-prone Atlanta Falcons on his back and carried them to a thrilling comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThursday night got even better for the fifth-year pro when the former University of Florida star learned his 11-reception, 166-yard, three-touchdown performance that keyed a 29-28 win was the most productive game by an NFL tight end in nearly three decades.\n\nThe previous tight end to finish with at least 10 catches, 150 yards receiving and three TDs in a game was Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in 1996.\n\nThe 25-year-old Pitts noted he wasn't even born yet back then.\n\n“Man, I love the state of Florida,” the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Pitts said as he stepped up to the podium in the visiting interview room at Raymond James Stadium.\n\n“It means a lot,” he added about the mention of Sharpe. “It's a great person to be (compared to).”\n\nKurt Cousins targeted Pitts a team-high 12 times, leaning heavily on the young tight end with leading receiver Drake London out with a knee injury. Pitts scored on receptions of 8, 17 and 7 yards, the latter trimming what had once been a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 28-26 with 3:34 remaining.\n\nHis last catch, on third-and-28 from the Atlanta 29, was for 14 yards. Cousins threw 21 yards to David Sills V on fourth-and-14 to set up Zane Gonzalez's 43-yard game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n“It was the plan, you know, all along. Kyle is our guy,” second-year Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. “You're down a couple of your guys like Drake, some of those guys, and Kyle has really filled in that role and become the lead dog guy. He has done an awesome job.”\n\nThe Falcons (5-9) are eliminated from playoff contention, but they relished the opportunity to play spoiler against the division-rival Bucs (7-7), who are trying to win the NFC South for the fifth straight season.\n\n“It's amazing. I mean, we've been having our ups and downs through the year,” Pitts said. “Obviously, it's not fun being eliminated early, but we're resilient. ... It was just pretty fun to get that win.”\n\nThe Falcons overcame a team-record 19 penalties for 125 yards. They also withstood a wide-open Sills dropping what would have been a go-ahead TD catch in the third quarter, as well as Bijan Robinson's third-quarter fumble that led to the touchdown that put Tampa Bay up by two scores early in the fourth.\n\n“It's a steppingstone to where we want to go,” Morris said. “We talked about this, building blocks for what we've got to do. What we're talking about is next year. ... Only thing we can do right now is finish.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

Police said he remained in custody on Thursday, and family members did not respond to inquiries from the BBC.\n\nMr Moore joined the Michigan Wolverines in 2018 as a tight-end coach. He became acting head coach in the 2023 season for three games, while then-head coach Jim Harbaugh was under suspension.\n\nMr Moore won each of the three games and was officially made head coach after Mr Harbaugh left to coach in the NFL.",

    "fullText": "Police in Michigan have issued a statement providing some details about why former University of Michigan Head Coach Sherrone Moore was taken into custody on December 10. However, even as Moore's career imploded and he, at least temporarily, lost his freedom, he still stands to potentially earn millions.\n\nWhat was Moore's salary? \"Moore's buyout was listed at $13.89 million. That number is the second-lowest among all listed coaches from the Big Ten,\" CBS News reported. According to USA Today, his total salary was $6.11 million, making him the 40th top-paid college football coach.\n\nIt was a whirlwind of developments, as the university announced it had fired Moore. Then, ESPN reported that he detained by police, a fact that was documented by jail records showing Moore, 39, confined to a Michigan jail. Now, police have finally provided some details about what is going on. Moore was ousted after \"credible evidence\" emerged that he \"engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,\" the university said, according to USA Today.\n\nBecause of the manner in which Moore was ousted (right before he was detained), it's not clear whether he will get the full buyout amount, according to CBS News.\n\n\"Michigan could be off the hook for some (or all) of his buyout, though cases like this have ended in court battles in the past,\" the network wrote.\n\nThe ex-coach stood to make a lot more money if he wasn't fired. \"Moore's contract at Michigan was set to pay $5.5 million in base salary and additional compensation annually through the 2029 season -- with a $500,000 retention bonus each season,\" wrote CBS News.\n\nTwo police departments were involved in taking Moore into custody, both Saline and Pittsfield Township, both in Michigan.\n\nAccording to ESPN, police \"responded at 4:10 p.m. to the 3000 block of Ann Arbor Saline Road.\" What happened? It was \"for the purposes of investigating an alleged assault. ... A suspect in this case was taken into custody. This incident does not appear to be random in nature, and there appears to be no ongoing threat to the community,\" added ESPN.\n\nSaline police had previously told ESPN that they \"assisted in locating and detaining former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore. Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges.\"\n\nMoore is married with three kids. He has been the head coach of the University of Michigan since 2022.\n\n\"The suspect was lodged at the Washtenaw County Jail pending review of charges by the Washtenaw County Prosecutor,\" the statement continued, according to ESPN. \"At this time, the investigation is ongoing. Given the nature of the allegations, the need to maintain the integrity of the investigation, and its current status at this time, we are prohibited from releasing additional details.\"\n\n\"Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,\" Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement. \"Following a university investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and UM maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.\"",

    "fullText": "Dec. 10 (UPI) -- The University of Michigan on Wednesday fired head football coach Sherrone Moore for \"an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,\" and hours later he was booked into a jail near the college's campus in Ann Arbor.\n\nMoore compiled a 17-8 record for two seasons after serving as offensive coordinator when the Wolverines won the national title in January 2024.\n\nFour hours after the school announced his termination, Moore was taken to the Washtenaw County Jail at 8:30 p.m EST, the Pittsfield Township Police Department told the Detroit Free Press. Police were called to investigate an alleged assault in Pittsfield Township.\n\n\"U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,\" Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement to the media. \"Following a University investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.\"\n\nNo details about the relationship have been released, though The Detroit News reported an outside investigation this week was conducted after an internal inquiry didn't reveal evidence of an inappropriate relationship.\n\nMoore, 39, married his wife, Kelli, in 2015, and they have three daughters.\n\nPossible criminal charges are being investigated.\n\nAt 4:10 p.m., the Pittsfield Township Police Department said officers responded to a call for an alleged assault investigation.\n\nThirty-three minutes later, the school announced the firing. The termination has not been posted on the school's website or social media accounts.\n\nPolice in Saline, near the Ann Arbor campus, said in a statement to ESPN that they \"assisted in locating and detaining Moore.\"\n\n\"Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges,\" the authorities said.\n\nMoore, the school's first Black head coach, signed a five-year contract before the 2024 season for at least $5.5 million annually. There is a $13.89 million buyout but his firing could void the amount, CBS Sports reported.\n\nBiff Poggi, 66, was appointed interim head football coach.\n\nMichigan (9-3) is scheduled to play Texas (9-3) in the Citrus Bowl on Dec. 31 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla. Last year, Michigan went 7-5 during the regular season and beat Alabama in the ReliaQuest Bowl in Tampa, Fla., on New Year's Eve.\n\nPoggi returned to Michigan as offensive coordinator and also filled in when Moore served a university-imposed suspension for games against Central Michigan and Nebraska in a sign-stealing saga. Moore was to be suspended for the first game of the 2026 season as a continuation of his punishment for the scouting scandal involving former staffer Connor Stalions.\n\nMoore was suspended for one game in the 2023 season as part of a self-imposed penalty for a recruiting violation.\n\nMoore had been on Jim Harbaugh's staff since 2018.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 18 days after Michigan won the national title, Moore replaced Harbaugh, who went to the NFL Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nDuring the championship season, he was the interim coach for the Wolverines for the final three games as Harbaugh served a suspension for his role in the sign-stealing saga.\n\nBefore coming to Michigan, Moore worked on Central Michigan's staff.\n\nUniversity of Michigan Regents in January 2022 fired President Mark Schlissel after an investigation found inappropriate conduct with an employee.\n\nDomenico Grasso became interim president in May after the resignation of Santa Ono, who was announced as the University's Florida president but the state board rejected his candidacy.",

    "fullText": "Head football coach for the University of Michigan, Sherrone Moore, has been detained just hours after being fired for having an “inappropriate relationship.”\n\nMoore, 39, was detained by police in Saline, Michigan, on Wednesday. He was later turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for an “investigation into potential charges,” the Saline Police Department said in a statement to ESPN.\n\nIt’s unclear what the investigation is in relation to.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Moore was fired “with cause” after a University of Michigan probe found “credible evidence” that the coach “engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,” the school said in a statement shared by multiple outlets.\n\n“This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior,” the University of Michigan said.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to the Pittsfield Township Police Department and the University of Michigan for comment.\n\nThis was just Moore’s second season as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines. He was given the title in January 2024 after six years as a member of the offensive staff. He was the University of Michigan’s first African American head coach.\n\nMoore has a wife, to whom he’s been married since 2015, and three daughters.\n\nAssociate coach Biff Poggi has been named as the University of Michigan’s interim head football coach.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines finished the regular season at 9-3 and have a game against the Texas Longhorns at the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl on December 31.\n\nDave Portnoy, the founder of sports and pop culture media company Barstool Sports, commended the University of Michigan’s decision to fire Moore.\n\n“On a serious note there have been a lot of schools over the years who have looked the other way with scandals. I’d just like to say I’m proud that Michigan refused to do the same,” Portnoy wrote on X Wednesday.\n\n“Sherrone broke the moral code and it cost him his job. It’s a hard lesson but it’s the Michigan Man Way. Leaders and best for a reason. Proud to be a Michigan Wolverine tonight.”\n\nMoore was also part of a sign-stealing scandal, which resulted in record fines expected to exceed $20 million imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association on the University of Michigan.\n\nSign-stealing is when a sports team decodes an opponent’s hand signals. The NCAA bans schools from sending scouts to future opponents’ games and using electronic equipment to record signals.\n\nMoore was given a three-game suspension for his role in the scheme, which he was expected to complete next year. Reports of the NCAA’s investigation surfaced early in the 2023 season, when Moore was working under Jim Harbaugh.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines came out on top in the 2023 season, winning the College Football Playoff national championship in a game against the Washington Huskies.\n\nPoggi successfully led the Michigan Wolverines for two games this year while Moore was suspended.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Tuesday said he will not intervene to stop the execution of Harold Wayne Nichols.\n\nNichols, 64, is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Thursday for the 1988 rape and murder of Karen Pulley, a 20-year-old student at Chattanooga State University.\n\nNichols confessed to killing Pulley as well as raping several other women in the Chattanooga area. Although he expressed remorse at trial, he admitted that he would have continued his violent behavior had he not been arrested. He was sentenced to death in 1990.\n\nNichols’ attorneys had sought to have his sentence commuted to life in prison, citing the fact that he took responsibility for his crimes and pleaded guilty. His clemency petition stated “he would be the first person to be executed for a crime he pleaded guilty to since Tennessee re-enacted the death penalty in 1978.”\n\nIn a statement emailed late on Tuesday, Lee said, “After deliberate consideration of Harold Wayne Nichols’ request for clemency, and after a thorough review of the case, I am upholding the sentence of the State of Tennessee and do not plan to intervene.”\n\nIn a recent interview, Pulley’s sister, Lisette Monroe, said the wait for Nichols’ execution has been “37 years of hell.” She described her sister as “gentle, sweet and innocent,” and said she hopes that after the execution she’ll be able to focus on the happy memories of Pulley instead of her murder.\n\nNichols' attorneys issued a statement saying they are “deeply saddened and gravely disappointed” by Lee's decision to deny clemency.\n\n“Wayne has spent decades taking accountability for his actions, working to transform his life, and being an extraordinary person who is loved and trusted by correctional officers, faith leaders, and many in his community,\" they wrote.\n\nNichols broke into Pulley’s home, raped her and beat her on the head with a 2-by-4 board. Pulley suffered massive brain injuries and died the next day.\n\nNichols was arrested several months after Pulley's murder for unrelated rapes and burglaries in the Chattanooga area. He confessed to raping several victims in Chattanooga over a two-month period prior to Pulley's slaying. He pleaded guilty to the rapes for two victims, but went to jury trial for two others and was convicted.",

    "title": "Sources: University of Utah nearing landmark private equity deal expected to generate $500 million",
    "description": "The new venture would generate a massive amount of money for the school in a groundbreaking move that may pave the way for more schools and conferences to do the same.",
    "fullText": "Private equity has officially arrived in college athletics.\n\nThe University of Utah is on the cusp of striking the industry’s first partnership with an equity firm in a marriage that features a nine-figure capital infusion and the creation and shared ownership of a for-profit entity to operate athletics business and financial elements outside of the traditional university framework.\n\nThe new venture is expected to generate as much or more than $500 million in capital — a groundbreaking and innovative move that may pave the way for more schools and conferences to pursue such a concept.\n\nFinalization of the project is expected soon pending authorization on Tuesday from the University of Utah Board of Trustees. The board is granting the university permission to move forward with the agreement with Otro Capital, a New York-based sports private equity firm.\n\nMultiple officials with knowledge of the project spoke to Yahoo Sports under condition of anonymity.\n\nThe endeavor with Otro Capital is more than just a nine-figure infusion of cash.\n\nAt the center of the project is the creation of a private, independent offshoot of the athletic department — Utah Brands & Entertainment LLC — in a first-of-its-kind partnership between a university athletic department and an equity partner. An executive team from Otro Capital, combined with athletics department personnel, will lead the creation and operation of the new company, which will live within the university’s foundation.\n\nThe university retains majority ownership and decision-making authority of Utah Brands & Entertainment. Otro marries the capital infusion with a team of experienced operators. A president from outside the university will preside over the company and report to a board, chaired by Utah athletic director Mark Harlan, with seats for trustees and Otro executives.\n\nThe project includes a fascinating wrinkle. The university is offering a prominent group of donors the ability to purchase a stake in Utah Brands & Entertainment. Already, university officials have culled a small donor base to generate millions in purchase agreements. The more than $500 million capital figure includes both the nine-figure cash infusion from Otro as well as those capital commitments from donors.\n\nUtah Brands & Entertainment will house most of the components traditionally held within the university’s athletic department, including many athletic personnel and divisions. However, fundraising will remain with the school.\n\nThe new company’s primary goal is to generate more revenue across an assortment of areas, including ticketing, concessions, corporate sales and sponsorships. Charged with overseeing and operating the revenue-share pay system for Utah athletes, the new entity provides the department with more flexibility and freedom considering it will operate separate from a public university.\n\nThe move isn’t completely foreign to college sports. Over the last several months, a host of schools — Kentucky, Michigan State, Clemson — have announced the creation of a private, revenue-generating entity outside of the athletic department as college sports evolves into a more professionalized ecosystem. None of those schools have partnered with an equity firm. However, Michigan State announced its own capital infusion of sorts in the form of a $401 million donation, a portion of which will go toward its new athletics entity.\n\nAs for Utah’s partnership, in exchange for the upfront cash, Otro will earn a large percentage of annual revenues generated from Utah Brands & Entertainment as it splits funds with the university. An exit strategy — in five to seven years — exists, and the university holds the right to purchase Otro’s ownership stake.\n\nThe emergence of private equity in college sports is a long time coming.\n\nFor the last two years, as university athletic departments face mounting financial stressors, dozens of schools pursued private capital or equity deals, including conferences as a whole — most notably the Big 12 and Big Ten. However, when these projects reached the finish line, they were stymied for various reasons.\n\nFor instance, Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark has twice presented such a deal before his presidential board. Big Ten officials nearly reached the point of a vote on a $2.4 billion capital deal before at least two schools — USC and Michigan — scuttled the project.\n\nYormark’s pursuit of a capital deal caught the attention of Harlan and Utah administrators, who, more than two years ago, began the process that resulted in the potential deal with Otro.\n\nAccording to its website, Otro seeks to invest in “sports teams, leagues and ecosystem businesses with strong intellectual property.” The company was founded in 2023 by partners Alec Scheiner, Niraj Shah, Brent Stehlik and Isaac Halyard, who all served as senior executives at RedBird Capital Partners, one of the globe’s largest sports industry investors.\n\nScheiner has a deep background as a sports investor and team executive, spending time as president of the Cleveland Browns and senior vice president of the Dallas Cowboys. He was the point man for Legends Hospitality, a corporation providing food, merchandise, retail and stadium operations for venues and companies worldwide. Stehlik was the previous president of OneTeam Partners and worked as a chief revenue officer for the Browns.\n\nOtro’s portfolio includes the Formula 1 Alpine Racing team, FlexWork Sports marketing and event company and Two Circles, a fan and data analytics platform. Otro will own a large share — but not a majority share — of Utah Brands & Entertainment, similar to its other projects. For instance, Otro invested $200 million in Alpine Racing to own a 24% equity stake.\n\nAccording to a 2024 story on buyoutinsider.com, Otro was targeting $500 million for a sports-focused investment fund. The company has pitched its college plan to other schools — one specifically in the Big Ten — before Utah expressed serious interest.\n\nIt’s unclear if Otro has plans to execute similar agreements with other schools.\n\nIn Salt Lake City, Otro executives, charged with revenue-generating goals, will have access to the school’s trademark and licensing rights, facilities, sponsorships and the university’s teams. However, decisions around coaching staff and player acquisition remain with university personnel.\n\nIn fact, the school cleared the partnership with NCAA officials. To remain under the NCAA’s umbrella, Utah’s university president and athletic director must retain the majority of decision-making.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge has allowed a Tufts University student from Turkey to resume research and teaching while she deals with the consequences of having her visa revoked by the Trump administration, leading to six weeks of detention.\n\nThe arrest of Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying children's relationship to social media, was among the first as the Trump administration began targeting foreign-born students and activists involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy. She had co-authored an op-ed criticizing her university’s response to Israel and the war in Gaza. Caught on video in March outside her Somerville residence, immigration enforcement officers took her away in an unmarked vehicle.\n\nÖztürk has been out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center since May and back on the Tufts campus. But she's been unable to teach or participate in research as part of her studies because of the termination of her record in the government's database of foreign students studying temporarily in the U.S.\n\nIn her ruling Monday, Chief U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper wrote that Öztürk is likely to succeed on claims that the termination was “arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and in violation of the First Amendment.”\n\nGovernment argued that termination was legal\n\nThe government’s lawyers unsuccessfully argued that the Boston federal court lacked jurisdiction and that Öztürk’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record (SEVIS) record was terminated legally after her visa was revoked, making her eligible for removal proceedings.\n\n“There’s no statute or regulation that’s been violated by the termination of the SEVIS record in this case,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter said during a hearing last week. The Associated Press sent an email Tuesday seeking comment from Sauter on whether the government plans to appeal.\n\nIn a statement, Öztürk, who plans to graduate next year, said while she is grateful for the court's decision, she feels “a great deal of grief” for the education she has been “arbitrarily denied as a scholar and a woman in my final year of doctoral studies.”\n\n“I hope one day we can create a world where everyone uses education to learn, connect, civically engage and benefit others — rather than criminalize and punish those whose opinions differ from our own,” said Öztürk, who is still challenging her arrest and detention.\n\nThe then-30-year-old was one of four students who wrote the opinion piece in the campus newspaper. It criticized the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nÖztürk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends in March for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan, according to her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai. Her student visa had been revoked several days earlier, but she was not informed of that, her lawyers said. The government asserted that terminating her SEVIS record two hours after her arrest was a proper way of informing Tufts University about her visa revocation.\n\nA State Department memo said Öztürk's visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions “‘may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization’ including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”\n\nÖztürk running out of time to pursue teaching, research goals\n\nWithout her SEVIS status reinstated, Öztürk said she couldn't qualify as a paid research assistant and couldn't fully reintegrate into academic life at Tufts.\n\n“We have a strange kind of legal gaslighting here, where the government claims it’s just a tinkering in a database, but this is really something that has a daily impact on Ms. Öztürk’s life,” her attorney, Adriana Lafaille of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in court.\n\n“We are running out of time to make this right. Each day that goes by is a day that she is being prevented from doing the work that she loves in the graduate program that she came here to be part of. Each day that this happens is a day that the government is allowed to continue to punish her for her protected speech.”\n\nÖztürk, meanwhile, has maintained a full course load and fulfilled all requirements to maintain her lawful student status, which the government hasn't terminated, her lawyer said.\n\nRecord created to collect information on international students\n\nSEVIS is mandated by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and administered by the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement “to collect information relating to nonimmigrant foreign students” and “use such information to carry out the enforcement functions of” ICE.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, when a SEVIS record is terminated, a student loses all on and/ or off-campus employment authorization and allows ICE agents to investigate to “confirm the departure of the student.”\n\nMcCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.",

    "description": "Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis show that psychedelic compounds such as psilocybin appear to distort the link between blood flow and brain-cell functioning, which scientists use to track brain activity.",
    "fullText": "Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug with promising clinical applications for treating mood disorders and substance abuse disorders. Recent work in functional MRI (fMRI) studies show that psychedelics can reset brain network activity — and it is thought that this effect, which can linger for days, might explain its therapeutic benefits.\n\nPsychedelics such as psilocybin act on a chemical in the brain called serotonin that controls the relaxation and contraction of blood vessels. Because fMRI uses changes in blood flow and blood oxygen levels in the brain as a proxy for brain activity, a team of WashU Medicine researchers set out to determine if these signals remained an accurate measure of brain activity in subjects dosed with a similar psychedelic that acts on the same chemicals.\n\nThey observed, in mice given this drug, that blood flow did not change as it normally would in relation to the activity of brain cells called neurons. When combined with a second medication that blocks a specific receptor in the brain that responds to serotonin, the blood flow effects from the psychedelic drug were removed.\n\nThe team’s subsequent studies using psilocybin in mice produced similar results to those observed with the first drug. Reanalyzing results from an earlier fMRI study in human subjects given psilocybin revealed similar effects on brain responses.\n\nThese results have important implications for how researchers interpret fMRI scans of brain activity in people who have taken psychedelics, and they may aid the scientific search for how psychedelics achieve their potential therapeutic effects.\n\nThe research was led by Adam Q. Bauer, an associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis’ Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology; Jordan G. McCall, an associate professor of anesthesiology in the Center for Clinical Pharmacology; and Joshua S. Siegel, MD, PhD, who conducted the work at WashU Medicine and is now an assistant professor at New York University. The study was published in Nature Neuroscience.\n\nTogether, the results from mice and humans indicate that the neurovascular effects of psychedelics need to be better understood when interpreting blood flow-dependent neuroimaging. As compounds like psilocybin are increasingly studied for treating conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder, treatment-resistant depression, substance abuse and stroke, understanding how psychedelics affect the reliability of brain scans as a proxy for brain activity is important for clinicians and researchers examining the effects of these drugs.",
