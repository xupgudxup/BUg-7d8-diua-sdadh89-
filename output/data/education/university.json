    "title": "New Quantum Antenna Reveals a Hidden Terahertz World",
    "description": "Researchers at the University of Warsaw have unveiled a breakthrough method for detecting and precisely calibrating terahertz frequency combs using a quantum antenna made from Rydberg atoms. By combining atomic electrometry with a powerful terahertz-to-light conversion technique, they achieved the first measurement of a single terahertz comb tooth—something previously impossible due to the limits of electronics and optical tools.",
    "fullText": "A research team from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw has introduced a new way to measure hard-to-detect terahertz signals using a \"quantum antenna.\" In their work, the scientists applied an innovative radio wave detection setup based on Rydberg atoms that not only senses terahertz radiation, but also accurately calibrates a so-called frequency comb in this part of the spectrum. Until recently, the terahertz range was considered a blank area in the electromagnetic spectrum, and the method reported in the journal Optica opens the door to extremely sensitive spectroscopy and a new class of room-temperature quantum sensors.\n\nTerahertz (THz) radiation, being part of the electromagnetic spectrum, lies at the boundary of electronics and optics, positioned between microwaves (used, for example, in Wi-Fi) and infrared. Although it holds immense potential for applications that include inspecting packages without harmful X-rays, superspeed 6G communication, and spectroscopy and imaging of organic compounds, turning this potential into precise and sensitive measurements has been technically very difficult. In the past few years, scientists have made major strides in both generating and detecting terahertz radiation, yet until now they had not been able to measure a frequency comb in this region with the required precision.\n\nFrequency combs as ultra-precise electromagnetic rulers\n\nWhy is this so important? Frequency combs, which earned a Nobel Prize in 2005, can be imagined as an incredibly accurate ruler made not from a solid material, but from light or radio waves. Instead of millimeter markings, there is a sequence of evenly spaced lines (\"teeth\") at strictly defined frequencies. This \"electromagnetic ruler\" lets physicists determine the frequency of an unknown signal with extraordinary accuracy simply by seeing which \"tooth\" it matches. Because of this, frequency combs act as reference standards that can be used to calibrate and stabilize many types of instruments over a wide range of frequencies. Depending on where in the electromagnetic spectrum this ruler sits, scientists talk about optical, radio, or terahertz frequency combs.\n\nTerahertz frequency combs are particularly attractive because they can support calibration and highly accurate measurements in a band where the oscillation frequencies are higher than typical radio waves but lower than optical waves (light). However, such combs are notoriously difficult to measure with high precision, since their oscillations are too rapid for conventional electronics and cannot be directly captured with standard optical methods. Researchers have been able to determine the spacing between the comb \"teeth\" and to measure the total power spread across the spectrum, but determining how much power belongs to a single tooth has remained a major challenge.\n\nRydberg atoms turned into quantum antennas\n\nThe scientists from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw have now overcome this obstacle and, for the first time, measured the signal emitted by a single terahertz comb tooth. To achieve this, they employed a gas of rubidium atoms prepared in a Rydberg state. A Rydberg atom is defined as having a single electron excited to a very high orbit by being illuminated with precisely tuned lasers. This \"swollen\" atom acts as a quantum antenna that is extremely sensitive to external electric fields. In addition, by using tunable lasers, the detector can be adjusted to respond to one specific frequency within such a field, across a range that extends up to terahertz waves.\n\nTraditionally, in Rydberg electrometry, the phenomenon of Autler-Townes splitting is used to measure the electric field. Its huge advantage is that the measurement result depends only on fundamental atomic constants, providing an absolutely calibrated readout. Unlike classical antennas, which require laborious calibration in specialized radio laboratories, the atomic-based system is, in a sense, a standard unto itself. Moreover, thanks to the richness of energy states in the atom, such a sensor can be tuned almost continuously over an enormous range, from a direct current (DC) signal up to the aforementioned terahertz.\n\nHybrid terahertz to light conversion for extreme sensitivity\n\nHowever, this method has a limitation: on its own, it is not sensitive enough to record very weak terahertz signals. To remedy this, the research team additionally applied a radio wave-to-light conversion technique invented at the University of Warsaw and adapted it to the needs of terahertz radiation. In this process, the weak terahertz signal is converted into optical photons, which can then be detected with immense sensitivity using single-photon counters. This hybrid approach is the key to success: it combines the extreme sensitivity of photon detection with the ability to \"recover\" the calibration capabilities of the Autler-Townes method even for the weakest signals.\n\nThe sensor based on Rydberg atoms possesses all the features needed to perform precise frequency comb calibration: it can be tuned to a single tooth of the comb, and then retuned to the next, and the next. The scientists managed to observe several dozen teeth in a very wide frequency range this way. Additionally, thanks to the knowledge of the fundamental properties of atoms, the comb was directly calibrated, precisely determining its intensity.\n\nNew path for terahertz metrology and future technologies\n\nThe results obtained by the physicists from the University of Warsaw Wiktor Krokosz, Jan Nowosielski, Bartosz Kasza, Sebastian Borówka, Mateusz Mazelanik, Wojciech Wasilewski, and Michał Parniak represent much more than the development of another sensitive detector. Their work lays the groundwork for a new area of metrology. With the help of Rydberg atoms, the transformative uses of optical frequency combs can now be extended into the previously difficult terahertz region. Importantly, unlike many quantum technologies that require extremely low temperatures, this system functions at room temperature, which greatly lowers costs and makes future commercialization more realistic. This creates an opportunity to build reference measurement standards for the coming generation of terahertz technologies.\n\nThe project \"Quantum Optical Technologies\" (FENG.02.01-IP.05-0017/23) is implemented as part of Measure 2.1 International Research Agendas of the Foundation for Polish Science, co-financed by the European Union from Priority 2 of the European Funds for Modern Economy Programme 2021-2027 (FENG). The research is also one of the results of the SONATA17 and PRELUDIUM23 projects funded by the National Science Centre.)\n\nMaterials provided by University of Warsaw, Faculty of Physics.

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Authorities on Monday had renewed a manhunt for the gunman who killed two students and injured seven more at Brown University over the weekend, after releasing a man who had been held on Sunday as ​a \"person of interest\" in the shooting.\n\nThough officials said late on Sunday they were resuming the search for a suspect, they said there were no ‌credible threats to the community and that they would not reimpose a shelter-in-place order for the campus and the surrounding area that had been lifted earlier.\n\nPolice have released surveillance footage showing the possible shooter ‌dressed in black walking near the building where the attack took place, though his face is not visible.\n\nThe gunman fled after shooting students in a classroom in Brown's Barus & Holley engineering and physics building, where outer doors had been left unlocked while exams were taking place, according to police.\n\nAt a press conference late on Sunday, officials said there had been enough evidence to justify taking into custody the unnamed person of interest, a man in his 20s.\n\nBut Providence Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters the investigation was going in a \"different direction,\" without ⁠offering more detail. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said ‌investigators had determined there was \"no basis to believe that he's a person of interest, so... he's being released.\"\n\nThe mass shooting shook the campus at Brown, one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the United States. The Ivy League school, which has nearly ‍11,000 undergraduate and graduate students, canceled exams and classes for the rest of the year, and the campus was quiet on Sunday as a light snowfall blanketed the city.\n\nThe two students killed were Ella Cook, a sophomore from Mountain Brook, Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, according to statements from various officials.\n\nCook was vice president of the ​school's College Republicans and a \"leading Republican voice at Brown,\" according to an X post from the New York Republicans Club. Her LinkedIn profile included jobs as an ‌ice cream server at a Mountain Brook creamery and a program assistant in New York.\n\n\"Wesley and I join the Mountain Brook community and all of Alabama in mourning the heartbreaking loss of one of our own, Ella Cook, who was senselessly killed over the weekend on Brown University's campus,\" U.S. Senator Katie Britt of Alabama wrote in a statement with her husband, Wesley.\n\nUmurzokov, an aspiring neurosurgeon, was \"the most kind-hearted person,\" according to a GoFundMe campaign set up by his family.\n\n\"He always lent a helping hand to anyone in need without hesitation, and was the most kind-hearted person our family knew,\" the family wrote. \"Our family is incredibly devastated by this loss.\"\n\nHe graduated from Midlothian ⁠High School in Virginia this spring, according to the Washington Post. In a statement, the U.S. ​ambassador to Uzbekistan, Jonathan Henick, mourned \"the loss of his bright future.\"\n\nRef Bari, 22, ​a graduate student at Brown, said he was inside the Barus & Holley building when he heard a series of loud popping sounds that appeared to be gunfire.\n\nBari ran out of the building and asked another student running in the street if he could hide with her ‍and her friends and she agreed. They ⁠returned to her basement apartment and hid in the bathroom.\n\n\"She trusted me,\" he said. \"The only connection between us is we're both students at Brown but beyond that, we don't know each other.\"\n\nTeaching assistant Joseph Oduro, 21, told CNN he was in a classroom that was attacked.\n\n\"The first couple of gunshots went ⁠straight to the chalkboard right where I was standing,\" Oduro said. \"Who knows, if I didn't duck, maybe I'm not here today.\"\n\nA student next to him took two bullets to the leg and was due ‌to undergo surgery on Sunday, he said.",

Craig Smalley said in livestreamed remarks.\n\nSmalley described Cook as a \"bright light\" who was engaged in the church and the broader community, and \"incredibly grounded and generous and faithful.\"\n\nCook's LinkedIn profile indicates that she began attending Brown in 2024.\n\nShe was vice president of the Brown Republicans, according to a social media post from Alex Shieh, who left the school earlier this year amid a furor over his DOGE-inspired \"bloat @ Brown\" campaign.\n\n\"Being a conservative at Brown isn't always the easiest, but Ella was never afraid to share her beliefs on an overwhelmingly liberal campus and support others in doing so,\" Shieh wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"Last spring, while I was under a disciplinary investigation for reporting on Brown's administration for the conservative student paper, almost nobody wanted to be associated with me,\" he added. \"Ella was one of the few who were willing to stand with me in public and help hand out newspapers in front of the dining hall.\"\n\nAlabama U.S. Sen. Katie Britt expressed her condolences to the family of Ella Cook, calling the student’s death “heartbreaking” and “senseless,\" according to reporting from the Montgomery Advertiser.\n\nIn a statement, Britt said she and her husband, Wesley, “joined the Mountain Brook community and all of Alabama in mourning the heartbreaking loss of one of our own, Ella Cook, who was senselessly killed over the weekend on Brown University’s campus.”\n\nShe offered comfort to those who knew Cook, noting that her life was “taken far too soon” and expressing gratitude to law enforcement officials working on the investigation. Britt also asked that Ella’s loved ones and community be kept in prayers during this difficult time.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Dec. 14, WRAL News and the News & Observer, in Raleigh, North Carolina, reported that Kendall Turner, a Brown freshman, is among the injured students.\n\nTurner is an alumnus of Durham Academy in Durham, North Carolina, said an email sent to the school community, according to reports from both outlets.\n\nThe email said that Turner underwent surgery and is now resting in critical but stable condition.

The Fort Worth school board has said it plans to appeal the commissioner’s decision, which was announced in October.\n\nThe education agency said in August that five school districts were at risk of intervention after enduring five consecutive years of unsatisfactory ratings. Since then, it has announced plans to take over four of them: Fort Worth, Lake Worth, Connally and Beaumont. Morath has not said whether he plans to intervene in the fifth district, Wichita Falls.\n\nEach of the schools that triggered takeovers in the Beaumont, Connally and Lake Worth districts educates a majority Black and Hispanic student population, and the overwhelming majority of their children come from low-income families.\n\nLake Worth’s Marilyn Miller Language Academy triggered the intervention in that district. In letters informing the districts about the takeovers, Morath noted that during the latest round of accountability ratings, all but one of Lake Worth’s six campuses earned failing grades. Meanwhile, five campuses have received unacceptable ratings for more than a year, while only 22% of students are meeting grade level across all subjects.\n\nLake Worth school district leaders were acutely aware of the challenges facing the school district leading up to the takeover, said Superintendent Mark Ramirez, who was hired this year. Ramirez said the district has focused on addressing the challenges facing each campus, which should serve as a foundation for the incoming board of managers to build upon.\n\n“Our preparation ensures zero instructional loss for our children,” Ramirez said.\n\nThe Connally district had two campuses that met the state’s takeover threshold: Connally Junior High and Connally Elementary. Since the 2022-23 school year, the number of campuses with academically unacceptable scores in the district has doubled, Morath noted. Only 24% of students in the district are meeting grade level. The junior high improved from an F to a D in the most recent ratings.\n\nIn a statement, the Connally district thanked the efforts of Superintendent Jill Bottelberghe in boosting academic performance in recent years but acknowledged the need for improvements.\n\n“We recognize that there is still work that needs to be done,” the statement said. “It is our hope that the appointed Board of Managers will work to not only improve our district’s academic performance, but also serve our community with the same passion and sincerity as our Board of Trustees has.”\n\nML King Middle School and Fehl-Price Elementary in the Beaumont district have also endured five consecutive years of failing grades. The commissioner cited data showing that the elementary school has never earned an acceptable rating, while the middle school has gone 11 years without one. The district has seven campuses with unacceptable ratings for more than a year and has not earned an overall acceptable rating since 2019. Thirty percent of students in the district are meeting grade level.\n\nThomas Sigee Sr., president of the Beaumont school board, said the district had sought to help its struggling campuses — including by partnering with charter schools — but ultimately could not lift them up to state standards. He questioned why the commissioner opted to take over the entire district instead of shutting down the schools.\n\n“We could have closed the schools for a year and facilitated those students to other campuses and go forward,” Sigee said. “I didn’t want the takeover because I knew it would spread chaos in our community.”\n\nIf the decision is finalized, it would mark the second time the state has placed the Beaumont district under its oversight. The education agency did so from 2014-2020 due to financial mismanagement.\n\nEach of the three districts will have opportunities later this month to attend an informal hearing with the commissioner to make their appeals. If Morath stands by his decision to intervene, they can then formally appeal to the State Office of Administrative Hearings.\n\nTakeovers were once rare in Texas, but they have grown more common in the last decade, thanks to the 2015 law that made it easier for the state to step in after five consecutive F grades. It also expanded the commissioner’s ability to initiate special investigations, which could lead to an intervention.\n\nThat A-F grading system is largely based on the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, a standardized exam that lawmakers voted this year to replace in 2027.\n\nBefore 2015, El Paso experienced the only academic takeover in Texas, due to a widespread cheating scandal. Since the law’s passage, the education agency has officially taken over three districts because of low academic performance: Marlin, Shepherd and Houston.\n\nMorath and state-appointed Superintendent Mike Miles believe the Houston ISD intervention was warranted, and they tout as evidence the improved test scores in the two years since it started. Students have improved in every tested subject. None of the district’s campuses received an F on the state’s accountability ratings in the 2024-25 school year, a drastic improvement from the 56 underperforming campuses in 2022-23.\n\nBut the intervention has also run into strong criticism. Teacher departures have skyrocketed. Thousands of students have unenrolled. And improved test scores have sparked concern that the district has accomplished its gains, in part, because of a hyperfocus on testing and moving students into less rigorous math and science classes.\n\nStephen Simpson, Jess Huff and Alex Nguyen contributed to this report.\n\nThis article first appeared on The Texas Tribune.",

    "fullText": "Another mass shooting, another impassioned plea for gun control from Steve Kerr.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors coach spoke for about three minutes unprompted on Sunday night before their 136-131 loss against the Portland Trail Blazers and again called for gun reform in the wake of a mass shooting at Brown University.\n\n“With what happened last night at Brown, it’s just a reminder to me that these shootings continue to happen, and there is something we can do about them. The loss that all of the people involved [Saturday] night, the loss that they’re feeling, it’s exactly the same loss as all the Parkland families, and every other mass shooting.\n\n“Nobody asked me about it today. I didn’t expect anybody to ask me. I doubt we’re gonna do a moment of silence out there because it’s human nature just to not want to deal with this stuff. And it’s human nature just to think, ‘This is so horrible. Let’s not even think about it.’ But we have to think about it.”\n\nSpeaking pregame, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr addresses gun violence following this weekend’s shooting at Brown University.\n\n“We know there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. … I just want people thinking ‘What if it were my child?’”\n\nMore: pic.twitter.com/E2n9z62jYZ\n\n— Sam Gordon (@BySamGordon) December 15, 2025\n\nA shooting took place at Brown University in Rhode Island on Saturday afternoon that left two people dead and nine others injured, according to The New York Times. An investigation is still ongoing. Authorities released a man who they had detained on Sunday night, and are still searching for the alleged gunman.\n\nAccording to the Gun Violence Archive, that was the 389th mass shootings in the United States so far this year. There have been others since.\n\nGun control is something that Kerr has been a strong advocate of for years. He’s spoken out about plenty of other mass shootings in the United States in the past, hosted a town hall about the issue, drawn support for groups founded by students who survived other mass shootings, and more. Kerr’s father, Malcolm, was shot and killed during a terrorist attack in Beirut in 1984 when Steve was a student at Arizona.\n\n“The vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,” Kerr said. “They have every right to own a gun. But it’s on us to decide if we actually want to take action as a country, as citizens. We know, we know that there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. And I just want people out there — it doesn’t matter if you’re Democrat or Republican, or gun owner, non-gun owner — I just want people thinking, ‘What if it were my child? What if it were my brother or sister?’ Would you be willing to stand up to your representatives and say, ‘You know what? Enough. I’m not gonna vote for you unless you are going to stand up for gun violence prevention through common-sense laws that the vast majority of Americans agree on.'\n\n“Or are we just gonna continue to let the gun lobby run us over and not do anything to protect each other, to protect our children, to protect our future. We have to make that decision.”\n\nKerr wasn't alone in the sports world, either. USC women's basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb, who played at Brown, spoke out on Saturday night.\n\n\"It's the guns,\" she said after the Trojans' loss to No. 1 UConn. \"We're the only country that lives this way.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time that Kerr has addressed this issue, and mass shootings continue to occur in the United States. Based on recent history, it likely won't be the last time we hear from Kerr about gun control, either.\n\nWhile Kerr knows how easy it would be to just give up and ignore the problem, especially since it seems like nothing is getting better, he ended his plea on Sunday night with a simple solution.\n\n“Don’t just look the other way, even though that’s human nature and I understand it,” Kerr said. “Think about it. Think about, do you want something done? Do you want your child to go to school terrified every day? Or do you want to actually take action?\n\n“Because that’s what a democracy is about. Where we demand that our representatives protect us. And that option is there. So, we can either just do what we’re continuing to do and let these things happen or make some demands. And so, as you’re thinking about this today, think about, what if it were your own family member?”",

    "description": "Gottlieb played college basketball at Brown and said she had a teammate whose daughter had to shelter in place in a library basement.",
    "fullText": "USC women’s basketball head coach Lindsay Gottlieb opened her postgame news conference after the No. 16 Trojans’ loss to No. 1 UConn on Saturday night with her thoughts on the mass shooting that took place at Brown University.\n\nProvidence police said Sunday morning that they had detained a person of interest after two people were killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting on campus during finals. The person is in their 30s. The shooting happened in an engineering building on campus as people in the area were told to shelter in place for hours afterward as police looked for the shooter.\n\nGottlieb played basketball at Brown and said that she checked her phone after the game to see many text messages about the shooting. She said she felt she needed to address the shooting because it was more important than basketball and that “we can all be better.”\n\n“It doesn’t need to be this way,” Gottlieb said. “Sending thoughts and prayers to my teammates who have kids there. To the parents that have to worry about their children, I’m just going to end it with that, but just to say we’re the only country that lives this way. The college football cycle has been in the news a million times and are we going to report about this? It’s the guns. We’re the only country that lives this way. Parents should not be worried about their kid — I have a teammate who has a daughter who is in the basement of a library because they don’t know what’s going on there. And she’s flying there tomorrow.\"\n\nPolice said the shooter had a handgun and fired more than 40 rounds during the incident. The mayor of Providence, Brett Smiley, said that the building’s outside doors were unlocked but that access to the classrooms where exams were taking place required a badge.\n\nGottlieb has been USC’s coach since 2021 after she spent two seasons as an assistant for the Cleveland Cavaliers following her time as Cal’s head coach. She played at Brown from 1995-99 and immediately got into coaching after her collegiate playing career was over.\n\nUSC lost 79-51 at home to UConn on Saturday night as the Trojans play the season without injured star JuJu Watkins. She injured her knee in the 2025 NCAA tournament before USC fell to UConn in the Elite Eight a season ago. Watkins, who suffered a torn ACL, will miss the entire 2025-26 season.",

    "fullText": "The person of interest detained in connection with the Brown University shooting, identified by law enforcement sources as Benjamin Erickson, is a decorated soldier who had served in a position at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nErickson, a 24-year-old Wisconsin native, served as an infantry soldier in the US Army, where he passed sniper training, had experience with firearms instruction and had served as a rifleman between 2021 and 2024, according to the profile.\n\nErickson also received a good conduct medal, participated in “security duties” near the president and assisted with funeral ceremonies at Arlington, the profile stated.\n\nThe LinkedIn page stated he planned to continue his college education at Brown University in the fall 2025 semester.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Army said Erickson had no deployments and left last year with the rank of specialist. Brown University did not immediately respond to questions about Erickson’s record.\n\nAuthorities said the person of interest was not a current student at Brown, but law enforcement sources indicated to CNN that he might have been recently enrolled.\n\nErickson took online classes with a focus on psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee after graduating from high school in July 2020, and then transferred to Brown for this fall semester after his military service ended, according to the profile, which noted a variety of interests including animal welfare, veteran support and helping the poor.\n\nThe profile further noted that he had interned as a carpenter and helped out at a horse rescue center.\n\nA staff member at the rescue, the Gentle Giants Draft Horse Rescue in Maryland, told CNN that Erickson was part of an Army unit that learned horse handling techniques at the rescue center between 2023 and 2024. Erickson was training with the Caisson Detachment of the US Army’s 3d US Infantry Regiment, the staff member said – a unit that provides escorts for military and state funerals.\n\nA high school yearbook included a photo of Erickson on his school’s wrestling team. A profile on X that appeared to belong to Erickson posted in 2016 and 2017 about wrestling, music and political satire.\n\nOne of Erickson’s former high school classmates, Bryce Jankowski, said he recently exchanged texts with Erickson, who said he was studying at Brown.\n\n“He said he was doing good,” Jankowski said. “He said he was living at a hotel because his apartment flooded,” though he said that did not seem to bother him.\n\nJankowski described Erickson as a well-behaved, smart individual. He did not recall Erickson making any concerning statements, harboring extremist views or having any behavioral challenges. “He was wicked smart.”\n\nAfter high school, he said Erickson had told him that he was in sniper school with the US military.\n\nA former wrestling teammate from high school, who asked not to be quoted by name, described Erickson as a “pretty nice guy, he was quiet… he becomes really outgoing when you get to know him, but he’s pretty quiet when you don’t.”\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, CNN observed the FBI at a Wisconsin home owned by Erickson’s family.\n\nA search of court databases showed no clear criminal history for Erickson aside from a 2023 case in which he was cited for driving on a sidewalk, a charge that was dismissed.\n\nCNN’s Bill Kirkos, Thomas Bordeaux and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Brandon Svaboda scored the go-ahead goal for Boston University men's ice hockey in the third period of Saturday's game.",
    "fullText": "BOSTON – Before the lights went out at Matthews Arena for the last time, they shined brightly on Boston University center Brandon Svoboda.\n\nThe sophomore from Pittsburgh scored two goals including the game-winner at 18:21 of the third to lift the Terriers to a 4-3 victory over Northeastern, on Saturday night. Svoboda’s fourth of the season was the final goal scored at Northeastern’s historic Matthews Arena.\n\nThe Terriers’ victory over the Huskies was the last sporting event played inside Matthews Arena, which officially opened its doors as Boston Arena in April of 1910.\n\n“I got a lucky bounce and I capitalized on it and put it in the back of the net,” said Svoboda. “Playing the last game ever in this building is pretty special and what was it, 1910 this place was built so it was pretty special being the last team playing in this building.\n\n“We are a young group and we are figuring it out so it was obviously a big deal to get a W in the last game in this arena.”\n\nBU improved to 9-8-1 and 6-3-0 in Hockey East going into the semester break while the No. 11 Huskies fell to 10-6-0 and 5-4-0 in the conference.\n\n“It was just a big win for us going into the semester break,” said BU coach Jay Pandolfo. “The first half has not been ideal for us so to finish it that way, to come back in the third period to win a hockey game in this environment, where this is their last home game here and they wanted to win and we found a way to pull it off.”\n\nNortheastern purchased the structure in 1979 and renamed it Matthews Arena three years later. The demolition of the old barn nestled between Mass. Ave and Gainsborough Street will begin in January and the new arena is scheduled to go online in September of 2028.\n\n“Having a new facility is definitely a big selling point,” said NU coach Jerry Keefe. “It is going to have all the amenities you need to develop players and I think this generation of recruits like the shiny and the new.”\n\nThe first Beanpot Tournament was played at Boston Arena in 1952, so it seemed appropriate that Northeastern would play its final game against a neighboring Beanpot opponent. BU played its home games at Boston Arena from 1918 to 1971 before moving into its new facility on Babcock Street.\n\nPandolfo enjoyed many Matthews moments both on the ice and behind the bench. Pandolfo also played in the final Beanpot game at the old Boston Garden.\n\n“I always enjoyed playing here that’s for sure,” Pandolfo said. “It was a fun place to play and I always enjoyed it and I enjoyed coaching there. It is a great environment and a special old building.\n\n“That’s the biggest attachment for me and that I just enjoyed it. My grandfather played at Northeastern, my mom’s dad and that makes it special as well. It was also Boston University’s home rink as well for a long time and that is a big reason we are here closing it out with Northeastern.”\n\nThe Huskies had some extra zip in their blades that created several scoring opportunities, all of which deftly handled by BU netminder Mikhail Yegorov.\n\nNU went up 1-0 on a power play goal by freshman center Jacob Mathieu at 11:28 of the first. Mathieu found an opening outside the BU crease and redirected Giacomo Martino’s wrister from the left circle for his fifth of the season.\n\nNU went up 2-0 at 14:36 when junior center Tyler Fukakusa finished a two-on-one break with his second goal of the season. BU got on the board when Svoboda netted a power play goal at 17:40, his third of the season.\n\n“We were playing fine but we just made some mistakes so to get out of that first period 2-1 was important no question about that,” said Pandolfo.\n\nBU tied the game 2-2 on sophomore center Sacha Boisvert’s second of the season at 13:38 of the second. NU went up 3-2 when sophomore left wing Joe Connor beat the buzzer at 19:59 with his sixth of the season. NU tied the game 3-3 on Kamil Bednarik tally at 18:02 of the third. Svoboda would score 19 seconds later to complete the comeback.\n\n“You give up a late goal at the end of the second period after a power play, that can really hurt you,” said Pandolfo. “But our guys were determined to come back.”",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Hundreds of police officers were scouring the Brown University campus along with nearby neighborhoods and poring over video in the hunt for a shooter who opened fire in a classroom, killing two people and wounding nine others.\n\nThe search stretched late into the night, well after the shooting erupted Saturday afternoon in the engineering building of the Ivy League school in Providence, Rhode Island, during final exams.\n\nSurveillance video released by police shows the suspect, dressed in black, calmly walking away from the scene. His face is not visible and investigators said it wasn't clear whether the suspect is a student.\n\nThe suspect was last seen leaving the engineering building and some witnesses told police the suspect, who could be in his 30s, may have been wearing a camouflage mask, Providence Police Deputy Chief Timothy O’Hara said.\n\nUniversity President Christina Paxson said she was told 10 people who were shot were students. Another person was injured by fragments from the shooting but it was not clear if the victim was a student, she said.\n\nThe search for the shooter paralyzed the campus, the nearby neighborhoods filled with stately brick homes and the downtown in Rhode Island's capital city. Streets normally bustling with activity on weekends were eerily quiet.\n\nStudents sheltered in place for hours into the night. Officers in tactical gear led students out of some campus buildings and into a fitness center where they waited. Others arrived at the shelter on buses without jackets or any belongings.\n\nMayor advised people to stay home\n\nInvestigators were not immediately sure how the shooter got inside the first-floor classroom. Outer doors of the building were unlocked but rooms being used for final exams required badge access, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said.\n\nHe encouraged people living near the campus to stay inside or not return home until a shelter-in-place order was lifted.\n\n“The Brown community’s heart is breaking and Providence’s heart is breaking along with it,” Smiley said.\n\nAuthorities believe the shooter used a handgun, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Dan McKee vowed that all resources were being deployed to catch the suspect. Rhode Island has some of the strictest gun laws in the U.S.\n\nNine people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island Hospital, where one was in critical condition. Six required intensive care but were not getting worse and two were stable, hospital spokesperson Kelly Brennan said.\n\nExams were underway during shooting\n\nEngineering design exams were underway when the shooting occurred in the Barus & Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department. The building includes more than 100 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and offices, according to the university’s website.\n\nEmma Ferraro, a chemical engineering student, was in the building’s lobby working on a final project when she heard loud pops coming from the east side. Once she realized they were gunshots, she darted for the door and ran to a nearby building where she sheltered for several hours.\n\nFormer ‘Survivor’ contestant just left the building\n\nEva Erickson, a doctoral candidate who was the runner-up earlier this year on the CBS reality competition show “Survivor,” said she left her lab in the engineering building 15 minutes before shots rang out.\n\nThe engineering and thermal science student shared candid moments on “Survivor” as the show’s first openly autistic contestant. She was locked down in the campus gym following the shooting and shared on social media that the only other member of her lab who was present was safely evacuated.\n\nBrown senior biochemistry student Alex Bruce was working on a final research project in his dorm directly across the street from the building when he heard sirens outside.\n\n“I’m just in here shaking,” he said, watching through the window as armed officers surrounded his dorm.\n\nStudents in a nearby lab turned off the lights and hid under desks after receiving an alert about the shooting, said Chiangheng Chien, a doctoral student in engineering who was about a block away from the scene.\n\nMari Camara, 20, a junior from New York City, was coming out of the library and rushed inside a taqueria to seek shelter. She spent more than three hours there, texting friends while police searched the campus.\n\n“Everyone is the same as me, shocked and terrified that something like this happened,” she said.\n\nBrown, the seventh oldest higher education institution in the U.S., is one of the nation’s most prestigious colleges with roughly 7,300 undergraduates and more than 3,000 graduate students. Tuition, housing and other fees run to nearly $100,000 per year, according to the university.",

    "fullText": "Kent State University is dropping 19 undergraduate degree programs with low enrollment to comply with Ohio's Senate Bill 1.\n\nUnder the law, which became effective in June, state colleges are now required to “eliminate any undergraduate degree program it offers if the institution confers an average of fewer than five degrees in the program annually over any three-year period,\" according to Kent State officials.\n\nOn Dec. 11, Kent State University’s Board of Trustees agreed to eliminate the programs, with this fall being the final admission. All currently enrolled students are receiving individualized advising and teach-out plans to ensure timely degree completion.\n\nThe degree programs being dropped effective fall 2026 include:\n\nThe Africana Studies major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Chemistry major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Classics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Community Health Education major within the Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nThe Dance and Dance Studies majors within the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.\n\nThe Earth Science majors within both the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science Education degrees.\n\nThe French major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Horticulture major within the Bachelor of Applied Horticulture degree, and the Horticulture Technology major within the Associate of Applied Science degree.\n\nThe Life Science major and the Life Science/Chemistry major within the Bachelor of Science Education degrees.\n\nThe Mathematics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Physical Science major within the Bachelor of Science Education degree.\n\nThe Physics major within the Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nThe Radiologic Technology major within the Associate of Technical Study degree.\n\nThe Respiratory Care major within the Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nThe School Health Education major within the Bachelor of Science Education degree.\n\nKent State will continue to offer related degrees or credentials in several areas under different program headings, according to university officials. For example, the Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics will sunset, but the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics continues to serve students in that field of study.\n\nFor Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Radiologic Technology, the university will maintain other degree options at the associate or bachelor’s degree level.\n\nFor Africana Studies, Classics, Dance, Earth Science, French and Horticulture, the university will continue to offer undergraduate minors or certificates.\n\nKent State also will maintain teacher education bachelor’s degree programs in science and health fields that align with the inactivated programs.\n\nThe board also approved a strategic partnership with NEOMED Clinical Services LLC to take over Kent State's student health services.\n\nThe board authorized the university to enter into a lease and health center services agreement with NEOMED Clinical Services, establishing a collaborative arrangement to provide comprehensive clinical care and preventive services on campus.\n\nNEOMED occupies about 10,500 square feet of space on the lower floor of the DeWeese Health Center to provide expanded clinical services, health education and outreach programs.\n\nThe three-year agreement begins July 1, 2026, with the option for two one-year renewals. NEOMED will provide all staffing for the health center services and will work cooperatively with Kent State’s Division of People, Culture and Belonging to offer retention to qualified employees.\n\nIn addition, the board approved a Student Health Fee effective fall 2026. Full-time undergraduate and graduate students will be assessed $90 per semester, while part-time students will pay $35 per semester.\n\nThe fee excludes College Credit Plus students, students enrolled in fully online programs, dissertation students and students enrolled at the College of Podiatric Medicine.\n\nIn other business, the board approved a six-year comprehensive capital plan for Fiscal Years 2027-32, identifying campus upgrade projects that are the most important to the institution.\n\nThe plan primarily includes projects funded by state capital appropriations and does not list projects solely financed by local funding or philanthropy.\n\nThe Ohio Office of Budget and Management requires that each state college submit a six-year capital plan.\n\nProjects for the first two years of the plan include:\n\nThe third phase of the renovation of White Hall on the Kent Campus will replace antiquated heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment to the remaining floors along with planned classroom and interior building improvements.\n\nTower renovations in University Library on the Kent Campus.\n\nContinued critical deferred maintenance of the aging infrastructure on the Kent Campus.\n\nInformation technology network access enhancements in academic buildings on the Kent Campus.\n\nThe second phase of Purinton Hall classroom renovations on the East Liverpool Campus.\n\nMain Classroom Building HVAC replacement on the Salem Campus.\n\nThe second phase of central chiller plant replacement on the Stark Campus.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Record-Courier: Kent State will eliminate 19 undergrad programs in fall 2026",

    "fullText": "In speculative decoding (for autoregressive models), we speed up generation by using a smaller model to generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a larger model.\nThe core idea is that most tokens are easily predictable; thus, we should be able to use a smaller and faster model for them.\nThe classic example is the following sentence:\n\n“Geoffrey Hinton did his PhD at the University ___ ___”.\n\nA small model can predict the next word “of” with high confidence, while the next token “Edinburgh” is much harder, requiring a larger model to verify.\n\nLanguage diffusion models sort-of have something analogous to speculative decoding built-in by default (and in some ways, a better version).\n\nFor diffusion language models with confidence-aware parallel decoding1, the model generates all tokens above a given confidence threshold at each step. Thus, “easy” tokens are generated in parallel.\nSome ways in which this is better than speculative decoding is that it is global (works across the entire context, not just for the next K tokens) and doesn’t require running two separate models.\nIn the following example:\n\nRepeat the word grape over and over again.\n\na diffusion language model could generate the prediction “grape” for the entire context length in one step, while in speculative decoding, even if the entire sequence is easily predictable, it can only predict K tokens at a time (typically around 4-8, from what I’ve read).\n\nThis benefit of increased parallel decoding partially depends on the structuredness of a text, which exists on a spectrum. An increase in confidence per output token directly leads to more tokens being decoded on average per step.1\n\nIncreased structure -> reduced entropy -> increased confidence -> higher parallel decoding\n\nThe grape example above is trivially structured, while normal text generation is unstructured and high entropy. Writing code (an actually useful domain) is somewhere in between.\n\nI had a large hunch that for structured tasks (like coding), the average number of tokens generated in parallel per step is higher than in normal text generation, and monotonically increases with the amount of structuredness present in the domain of the output.\n\nI recall reading that Google Gemini was much closer to state of the art for code generation than it was for reasoning tasks when it was first released. Perhaps this improvement for structured tasks is a general motif when it comes to these models?\n\nI threw together a small test and used the model from the paper Fast dLLM v2 (available on Huggingface) to generate roughly 256 tokens for 10 different prompts (each ran 10 times on A100s with an additional 2 generations for warmup):\n\nThe code for everything can be found here, which additionally includes generated output and metadata for each run. Below are the results:\n\nAs predicted, the grape example was dramatically faster than the unstructured text. What was surprising was how much faster (2.33 times speedup!) code generation was compared to unstructured text, even across multiple examples.\n\nMore testing should be done, but I imagine that there is a negative correlation between relative speedup and program complexity, and that boiler plate code (ex. self.input = input) would have a higher speedup compared to logic-heavy sections.\n\nAnother interesting result was that generating the start of the Declaration of Independence, a document which the model must have memorized, didn’t have much speedup. This tiny ablation study suggests that it really is the structuredness of the output, not memorization, which matters.\n\nThis was a small test thrown together in under an hour, and more rigorous evaluations should be done, but these preliminary results hint that this idea might be true to some degree.\n\nAn important limitation to address: In autoregressive decoding, we constrained decoding where we set all syntactically invalid tokens to have a probability of zero, ensuring that we are only generating text which follows some rules (JSON formatting, syntactically correct code, etc). For diffusion language models, this can’t naively be applied. However, similar to figuring out KVCache reuse with the advent of KVCache approximation, we might find a practical solution to this problem.2\n\nRead the section “Confidence-Aware Parallel Decoding” in the paper, Fast-dLLM. ↩︎ ↩︎\n\nThere are lots of papers of doing semi-autoregressive generation using diffusion language models. See AR-Diffusion, Fast-dLLM, Block Diffusion, etc. ↩︎",

But we've proven with this research that even individuals with higher bone mineral density are able to float successfully in water.”:: The BSAStatistics show Black children in England are three times more likely to drown than white children.“...we know that 96% of adults in England do not swim regularly. We know that water safety isn't prioritized in schools and local swimming clubs and in after-school programs either. So when we're looking at the broader picture of things, Black and Asian communities face a higher risk of drowning.'':: The BSAThe study found with proper instructions ninety percent of participants could float successfully for two minutes.Body composition analysis assessed factors that affect buoyancy, and tested different floating techniques.The results indicated body fat percentage, rather than bone density, is a factor in buoyancy, though not the sole determinant of one's ability to float.Jones says the way Britain teaches floating needs to change from a one method for all approach.''Floating is unique and bespoke to everybody, depending on their unique body composition.''''But as long as your face is up and you are breathing and you are safe and you are able to keep your airways open and receive oxygen, you are floating.'':: The BSAThe BSA hopes the research will help improve attitudes to swimming in Black and Asian communities and encourage more people to learn how to float.",

The Justice Department continued to hold onto those files and conducted searches of them this fall, without a new warrant, as they prepared a case charging Comey with lying to Congress five years ago.\n\nRichman alleged that the Justice Department violated his Fourth Amendment rights by retaining his records and by conducting new warrantless searches of the files, prompting Kollar-Kotelly to issue an order last week temporarily barring prosecutors from accessing the files as part of its investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department said the request for the return of the records was merely an attempt to impede a new prosecution of Comey, but the judge again sided with Richman in a 46-page order Friday that directed the Justice Department to give him back his files.\n\n“When the Government violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by sweeping up a broad swath of a person’s electronic files, retaining those files long after the relevant investigation has ended, and later sifting through those files without a warrant to obtain evidence against someone else, what remedy is available to the victim of the Government’s unlawful intrusion?” the judge wrote.\n\nOne answer, she said, is to require the government to return the property to the rightful owner.\n\nThe judge did, however, permit the Justice Department to file an electronic copy of Richman's records under seal with the Eastern District of Virginia, where the Comey investigation has been based, and suggested prosecutors could try to access it later with a lawful search warrant.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges that Comey used Richman to share information with the news media about his decision-making during the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Prosecutors charged the former FBI director in September with lying to Congress by denying that he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source for the media.\n\nThat indictment was dismissed last month after a federal judge in Virginia ruled that the prosecutor who brought the case, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. But the ruling left open the possibility that the government could try again to seek charges against Comey, a longtime foe of President Donald Trump. Comey has pleaded not guilty, denied having made a false statement and accused the Justice Department of a vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Comey saga has a long history.\n\nIn June 2017, one month after Comey was fired as FBI director, he testified that he had given Richman a copy of a memo he had written documenting a conversation he had with Trump and had authorized him to share the contents of the memo with a reporter.\n\nAfter that testimony, Richman permitted the FBI to create an image, or complete electronic copy, of all files on his computer and a hard drive attached to that computer. He authorized the FBI to conduct a search for limited purposes, the judge noted.\n\nThen, in 2019 and 2020, the FBI and Justice Department obtained search warrants to obtain Richman's email accounts and computer files as part of a media leak investigation that concluded in 2021 without charges. Those warrants were limited in scope, but Richman has alleged that the government collected more information than the warrants allowed, including personal medial information and sensitive correspondence.\n\nIn addition, Richman said the Justice Department violated his rights by searching his files in September, without a new warrant, as part of an entirely separate investigation.\n\n“The Court further concludes that the Government’s retention of Petitioner Richman’s files amounts to an ongoing unreasonable seizure,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote. “Therefore, the Court agrees with Petitioner Richman that the Government has violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.”",

    "description": "His reporting on a Stanford University president put Theo Baker on the map, but his upcoming book may cement his reputation as the rare young journalist willing to challenge Silicon Valley's startup machine.",
    "fullText": "Theo Baker is truly an outlier.\n\nWhile journalism as a major has seen shrinking enrollment for years and is even being dropped by some schools entirely, Baker, a senior at Stanford University, has doubled down on old-school investigative reporting, and it is paying off spectacularly.\n\nBaker first made headlines as a college freshman when his reporting for The Stanford Daily led to the resignation of Stanford president Marc Tessier-Lavigne. After uncovering allegations of research misconduct spanning two decades, Baker — just one month into college — found himself “receiving anonymous letters, conducting stakeouts, and tracking down confidential sources,” according to his publisher. Meanwhile, high-powered lawyers tried to discredit his work. By year’s end, Tessier-Lavigne had resigned, and Baker became the youngest-ever recipient of the George Polk Award, one of journalism’s most prestigious honors.\n\nShortly after, Warner Bros. and famed producer Amy Pascal won a competitive auction for the film rights to his story.\n\nBut if that scandal put Baker on the map, his upcoming book may cement his reputation as the rare young journalist willing to challenge Silicon Valley’s startup machine.\n\n“How to Rule the World,” out May 19 — three weeks before he graduates — promises an explosive look at how venture capitalists treat Stanford students as “a commodity,” wooing favored undergrads with slush funds, shell companies, yacht parties, and funding offers before they even have business ideas in their hunt for the next trillion-dollar founder.\n\n“I watched in real time as my peers were taught to cut corners and plied with enormous wealth by people who wanted to exploit their talent,” Baker, who turns 21 next month, tells Axios. Drawing on more than 250 interviews with students, CEOs, VCs, Nobel laureates, and three Stanford presidents, the book aims to expose what Baker describes to Axios as a “weird, money-soaked subculture that has so much influence over the rest of the world.”\n\nIt’s perhaps an unsurprising move from someone who grew up around top journalists. His father is New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker, and his mother is The New Yorker’s Susan Glasser. While his peers chase venture capital funding and six-figure startup salaries, Baker spent his sophomore year reporting and took his junior year off to write, including two months at the Yaddo writers’ retreat.\n\nThat choice becomes even more striking against the backdrop of journalism’s current struggles. While traditional journalism programs fail to fill classes and media outfits face seemingly relentless layoffs, Baker represents something both exciting and increasingly uncommon: a star student betting his career on accountability journalism. Whether he’s a harbinger of renewed interest in investigative reporting remains to be seen, but we’d guess his book will capture the attention of plenty of college students — and it will almost certainly make waves in Silicon Valley while doing it.",

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Catch by catch, Kyle Pitts Sr. put the mistake-prone Atlanta Falcons on his back and carried them to a thrilling comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThursday night got even better for the fifth-year pro when the former University of Florida star learned his 11-reception, 166-yard, three-touchdown performance that keyed a 29-28 win was the most productive game by an NFL tight end in nearly three decades.\n\nThe previous tight end to finish with at least 10 catches, 150 yards receiving and three TDs in a game was Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in 1996.\n\nThe 25-year-old Pitts noted he wasn't even born yet back then.\n\n“Man, I love the state of Florida,” the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Pitts said as he stepped up to the podium in the visiting interview room at Raymond James Stadium.\n\n“It means a lot,” he added about the mention of Sharpe. “It's a great person to be (compared to).”\n\nKurt Cousins targeted Pitts a team-high 12 times, leaning heavily on the young tight end with leading receiver Drake London out with a knee injury. Pitts scored on receptions of 8, 17 and 7 yards, the latter trimming what had once been a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 28-26 with 3:34 remaining.\n\nHis last catch, on third-and-28 from the Atlanta 29, was for 14 yards. Cousins threw 21 yards to David Sills V on fourth-and-14 to set up Zane Gonzalez's 43-yard game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n“It was the plan, you know, all along. Kyle is our guy,” second-year Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. “You're down a couple of your guys like Drake, some of those guys, and Kyle has really filled in that role and become the lead dog guy. He has done an awesome job.”\n\nThe Falcons (5-9) are eliminated from playoff contention, but they relished the opportunity to play spoiler against the division-rival Bucs (7-7), who are trying to win the NFC South for the fifth straight season.\n\n“It's amazing. I mean, we've been having our ups and downs through the year,” Pitts said. “Obviously, it's not fun being eliminated early, but we're resilient. ... It was just pretty fun to get that win.”\n\nThe Falcons overcame a team-record 19 penalties for 125 yards. They also withstood a wide-open Sills dropping what would have been a go-ahead TD catch in the third quarter, as well as Bijan Robinson's third-quarter fumble that led to the touchdown that put Tampa Bay up by two scores early in the fourth.\n\n“It's a steppingstone to where we want to go,” Morris said. “We talked about this, building blocks for what we've got to do. What we're talking about is next year. ... Only thing we can do right now is finish.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Police in Michigan have issued a statement providing some details about why former University of Michigan Head Coach Sherrone Moore was taken into custody on December 10. However, even as Moore's career imploded and he, at least temporarily, lost his freedom, he still stands to potentially earn millions.\n\nWhat was Moore's salary? \"Moore's buyout was listed at $13.89 million. That number is the second-lowest among all listed coaches from the Big Ten,\" CBS News reported. According to USA Today, his total salary was $6.11 million, making him the 40th top-paid college football coach.\n\nIt was a whirlwind of developments, as the university announced it had fired Moore. Then, ESPN reported that he detained by police, a fact that was documented by jail records showing Moore, 39, confined to a Michigan jail. Now, police have finally provided some details about what is going on. Moore was ousted after \"credible evidence\" emerged that he \"engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,\" the university said, according to USA Today.\n\nBecause of the manner in which Moore was ousted (right before he was detained), it's not clear whether he will get the full buyout amount, according to CBS News.\n\n\"Michigan could be off the hook for some (or all) of his buyout, though cases like this have ended in court battles in the past,\" the network wrote.\n\nThe ex-coach stood to make a lot more money if he wasn't fired. \"Moore's contract at Michigan was set to pay $5.5 million in base salary and additional compensation annually through the 2029 season -- with a $500,000 retention bonus each season,\" wrote CBS News.\n\nTwo police departments were involved in taking Moore into custody, both Saline and Pittsfield Township, both in Michigan.\n\nAccording to ESPN, police \"responded at 4:10 p.m. to the 3000 block of Ann Arbor Saline Road.\" What happened? It was \"for the purposes of investigating an alleged assault. ... A suspect in this case was taken into custody. This incident does not appear to be random in nature, and there appears to be no ongoing threat to the community,\" added ESPN.\n\nSaline police had previously told ESPN that they \"assisted in locating and detaining former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore. Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges.\"\n\nMoore is married with three kids. He has been the head coach of the University of Michigan since 2022.\n\n\"The suspect was lodged at the Washtenaw County Jail pending review of charges by the Washtenaw County Prosecutor,\" the statement continued, according to ESPN. \"At this time, the investigation is ongoing. Given the nature of the allegations, the need to maintain the integrity of the investigation, and its current status at this time, we are prohibited from releasing additional details.\"\n\n\"Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,\" Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement. \"Following a university investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and UM maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.\"",

Police were called to investigate an alleged assault in Pittsfield Township.\n\n\"U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,\" Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said in a statement to the media. \"Following a University investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.

There is a $13.89 million buyout but his firing could void the amount, CBS Sports reported.\n\nBiff Poggi, 66, was appointed interim head football coach.\n\nMichigan (9-3) is scheduled to play Texas (9-3) in the Citrus Bowl on Dec. 31 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla. Last year, Michigan went 7-5 during the regular season and beat Alabama in the ReliaQuest Bowl in Tampa, Fla., on New Year's Eve.\n\nPoggi returned to Michigan as offensive coordinator and also filled in when Moore served a university-imposed suspension for games against Central Michigan and Nebraska in a sign-stealing saga. Moore was to be suspended for the first game of the 2026 season as a continuation of his punishment for the scouting scandal involving former staffer Connor Stalions.\n\nMoore was suspended for one game in the 2023 season as part of a self-imposed penalty for a recruiting violation.\n\nMoore had been on Jim Harbaugh's staff since 2018.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 18 days after Michigan won the national title, Moore replaced Harbaugh, who went to the NFL Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nDuring the championship season, he was the interim coach for the Wolverines for the final three games as Harbaugh served a suspension for his role in the sign-stealing saga.\n\nBefore coming to Michigan, Moore worked on Central Michigan's staff.\n\nUniversity of Michigan Regents in January 2022 fired President Mark Schlissel after an investigation found inappropriate conduct with an employee.\n\nDomenico Grasso became interim president in May after the resignation of Santa Ono, who was announced as the University's Florida president but the state board rejected his candidacy.",

He was the University of Michigan’s first African American head coach.\n\nMoore has a wife, to whom he’s been married since 2015, and three daughters.\n\nAssociate coach Biff Poggi has been named as the University of Michigan’s interim head football coach.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines finished the regular season at 9-3 and have a game against the Texas Longhorns at the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl on December 31.\n\nDave Portnoy, the founder of sports and pop culture media company Barstool Sports, commended the University of Michigan’s decision to fire Moore.\n\n“On a serious note there have been a lot of schools over the years who have looked the other way with scandals. I’d just like to say I’m proud that Michigan refused to do the same,” Portnoy wrote on X Wednesday.\n\n“Sherrone broke the moral code and it cost him his job. It’s a hard lesson but it’s the Michigan Man Way. Leaders and best for a reason. Proud to be a Michigan Wolverine tonight.”\n\nMoore was also part of a sign-stealing scandal, which resulted in record fines expected to exceed $20 million imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association on the University of Michigan.\n\nSign-stealing is when a sports team decodes an opponent’s hand signals. The NCAA bans schools from sending scouts to future opponents’ games and using electronic equipment to record signals.\n\nMoore was given a three-game suspension for his role in the scheme, which he was expected to complete next year. Reports of the NCAA’s investigation surfaced early in the 2023 season, when Moore was working under Jim Harbaugh.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines came out on top in the 2023 season, winning the College Football Playoff national championship in a game against the Washington Huskies.\n\nPoggi successfully led the Michigan Wolverines for two games this year while Moore was suspended.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Tuesday said he will not intervene to stop the execution of Harold Wayne Nichols.\n\nNichols, 64, is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Thursday for the 1988 rape and murder of Karen Pulley, a 20-year-old student at Chattanooga State University.\n\nNichols confessed to killing Pulley as well as raping several other women in the Chattanooga area. Although he expressed remorse at trial, he admitted that he would have continued his violent behavior had he not been arrested. He was sentenced to death in 1990.\n\nNichols’ attorneys had sought to have his sentence commuted to life in prison, citing the fact that he took responsibility for his crimes and pleaded guilty. His clemency petition stated “he would be the first person to be executed for a crime he pleaded guilty to since Tennessee re-enacted the death penalty in 1978.”\n\nIn a statement emailed late on Tuesday, Lee said, “After deliberate consideration of Harold Wayne Nichols’ request for clemency, and after a thorough review of the case, I am upholding the sentence of the State of Tennessee and do not plan to intervene.”\n\nIn a recent interview, Pulley’s sister, Lisette Monroe, said the wait for Nichols’ execution has been “37 years of hell.” She described her sister as “gentle, sweet and innocent,” and said she hopes that after the execution she’ll be able to focus on the happy memories of Pulley instead of her murder.\n\nNichols' attorneys issued a statement saying they are “deeply saddened and gravely disappointed” by Lee's decision to deny clemency.\n\n“Wayne has spent decades taking accountability for his actions, working to transform his life, and being an extraordinary person who is loved and trusted by correctional officers, faith leaders, and many in his community,\" they wrote.\n\nNichols broke into Pulley’s home, raped her and beat her on the head with a 2-by-4 board. Pulley suffered massive brain injuries and died the next day.\n\nNichols was arrested several months after Pulley's murder for unrelated rapes and burglaries in the Chattanooga area. He confessed to raping several victims in Chattanooga over a two-month period prior to Pulley's slaying. He pleaded guilty to the rapes for two victims, but went to jury trial for two others and was convicted.",

    "title": "Sources: University of Utah nearing landmark private equity deal expected to generate $500 million",
    "description": "The new venture would generate a massive amount of money for the school in a groundbreaking move that may pave the way for more schools and conferences to do the same.",
    "fullText": "Private equity has officially arrived in college athletics.\n\nThe University of Utah is on the cusp of striking the industry’s first partnership with an equity firm in a marriage that features a nine-figure capital infusion and the creation and shared ownership of a for-profit entity to operate athletics business and financial elements outside of the traditional university framework.\n\nThe new venture is expected to generate as much or more than $500 million in capital — a groundbreaking and innovative move that may pave the way for more schools and conferences to pursue such a concept.\n\nFinalization of the project is expected soon pending authorization on Tuesday from the University of Utah Board of Trustees. The board is granting the university permission to move forward with the agreement with Otro Capital, a New York-based sports private equity firm.\n\nMultiple officials with knowledge of the project spoke to Yahoo Sports under condition of anonymity.\n\nThe endeavor with Otro Capital is more than just a nine-figure infusion of cash.\n\nAt the center of the project is the creation of a private, independent offshoot of the athletic department — Utah Brands & Entertainment LLC — in a first-of-its-kind partnership between a university athletic department and an equity partner. An executive team from Otro Capital, combined with athletics department personnel, will lead the creation and operation of the new company, which will live within the university’s foundation.\n\nThe university retains majority ownership and decision-making authority of Utah Brands & Entertainment. Otro marries the capital infusion with a team of experienced operators. A president from outside the university will preside over the company and report to a board, chaired by Utah athletic director Mark Harlan, with seats for trustees and Otro executives.\n\nThe project includes a fascinating wrinkle. The university is offering a prominent group of donors the ability to purchase a stake in Utah Brands & Entertainment. Already, university officials have culled a small donor base to generate millions in purchase agreements. The more than $500 million capital figure includes both the nine-figure cash infusion from Otro as well as those capital commitments from donors.\n\nUtah Brands & Entertainment will house most of the components traditionally held within the university’s athletic department, including many athletic personnel and divisions. However, fundraising will remain with the school.\n\nThe new company’s primary goal is to generate more revenue across an assortment of areas, including ticketing, concessions, corporate sales and sponsorships. Charged with overseeing and operating the revenue-share pay system for Utah athletes, the new entity provides the department with more flexibility and freedom considering it will operate separate from a public university.\n\nThe move isn’t completely foreign to college sports. Over the last several months, a host of schools — Kentucky, Michigan State, Clemson — have announced the creation of a private, revenue-generating entity outside of the athletic department as college sports evolves into a more professionalized ecosystem. None of those schools have partnered with an equity firm. However, Michigan State announced its own capital infusion of sorts in the form of a $401 million donation, a portion of which will go toward its new athletics entity.\n\nAs for Utah’s partnership, in exchange for the upfront cash, Otro will earn a large percentage of annual revenues generated from Utah Brands & Entertainment as it splits funds with the university. An exit strategy — in five to seven years — exists, and the university holds the right to purchase Otro’s ownership stake.\n\nThe emergence of private equity in college sports is a long time coming.\n\nFor the last two years, as university athletic departments face mounting financial stressors, dozens of schools pursued private capital or equity deals, including conferences as a whole — most notably the Big 12 and Big Ten. However, when these projects reached the finish line, they were stymied for various reasons.\n\nFor instance, Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark has twice presented such a deal before his presidential board. Big Ten officials nearly reached the point of a vote on a $2.4 billion capital deal before at least two schools — USC and Michigan — scuttled the project.\n\nYormark’s pursuit of a capital deal caught the attention of Harlan and Utah administrators, who, more than two years ago, began the process that resulted in the potential deal with Otro.\n\nAccording to its website, Otro seeks to invest in “sports teams, leagues and ecosystem businesses with strong intellectual property.” The company was founded in 2023 by partners Alec Scheiner, Niraj Shah, Brent Stehlik and Isaac Halyard, who all served as senior executives at RedBird Capital Partners, one of the globe’s largest sports industry investors.\n\nScheiner has a deep background as a sports investor and team executive, spending time as president of the Cleveland Browns and senior vice president of the Dallas Cowboys. He was the point man for Legends Hospitality, a corporation providing food, merchandise, retail and stadium operations for venues and companies worldwide. Stehlik was the previous president of OneTeam Partners and worked as a chief revenue officer for the Browns.\n\nOtro’s portfolio includes the Formula 1 Alpine Racing team, FlexWork Sports marketing and event company and Two Circles, a fan and data analytics platform. Otro will own a large share — but not a majority share — of Utah Brands & Entertainment, similar to its other projects. For instance, Otro invested $200 million in Alpine Racing to own a 24% equity stake.\n\nAccording to a 2024 story on buyoutinsider.com, Otro was targeting $500 million for a sports-focused investment fund. The company has pitched its college plan to other schools — one specifically in the Big Ten — before Utah expressed serious interest.\n\nIt’s unclear if Otro has plans to execute similar agreements with other schools.\n\nIn Salt Lake City, Otro executives, charged with revenue-generating goals, will have access to the school’s trademark and licensing rights, facilities, sponsorships and the university’s teams. However, decisions around coaching staff and player acquisition remain with university personnel.\n\nIn fact, the school cleared the partnership with NCAA officials. To remain under the NCAA’s umbrella, Utah’s university president and athletic director must retain the majority of decision-making.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge has allowed a Tufts University student from Turkey to resume research and teaching while she deals with the consequences of having her visa revoked by the Trump administration, leading to six weeks of detention.\n\nThe arrest of Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying children's relationship to social media, was among the first as the Trump administration began targeting foreign-born students and activists involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy. She had co-authored an op-ed criticizing her university’s response to Israel and the war in Gaza. Caught on video in March outside her Somerville residence, immigration enforcement officers took her away in an unmarked vehicle.\n\nÖztürk has been out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center since May and back on the Tufts campus. But she's been unable to teach or participate in research as part of her studies because of the termination of her record in the government's database of foreign students studying temporarily in the U.S.\n\nIn her ruling Monday, Chief U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper wrote that Öztürk is likely to succeed on claims that the termination was “arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and in violation of the First Amendment.”\n\nGovernment argued that termination was legal\n\nThe government’s lawyers unsuccessfully argued that the Boston federal court lacked jurisdiction and that Öztürk’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record (SEVIS) record was terminated legally after her visa was revoked, making her eligible for removal proceedings.\n\n“There’s no statute or regulation that’s been violated by the termination of the SEVIS record in this case,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter said during a hearing last week. The Associated Press sent an email Tuesday seeking comment from Sauter on whether the government plans to appeal.\n\nIn a statement, Öztürk, who plans to graduate next year, said while she is grateful for the court's decision, she feels “a great deal of grief” for the education she has been “arbitrarily denied as a scholar and a woman in my final year of doctoral studies.”\n\n“I hope one day we can create a world where everyone uses education to learn, connect, civically engage and benefit others — rather than criminalize and punish those whose opinions differ from our own,” said Öztürk, who is still challenging her arrest and detention.\n\nThe then-30-year-old was one of four students who wrote the opinion piece in the campus newspaper. It criticized the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nÖztürk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends in March for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan, according to her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai. Her student visa had been revoked several days earlier, but she was not informed of that, her lawyers said. The government asserted that terminating her SEVIS record two hours after her arrest was a proper way of informing Tufts University about her visa revocation.\n\nA State Department memo said Öztürk's visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions “‘may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization’ including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”\n\nÖztürk running out of time to pursue teaching, research goals\n\nWithout her SEVIS status reinstated, Öztürk said she couldn't qualify as a paid research assistant and couldn't fully reintegrate into academic life at Tufts.\n\n“We have a strange kind of legal gaslighting here, where the government claims it’s just a tinkering in a database, but this is really something that has a daily impact on Ms. Öztürk’s life,” her attorney, Adriana Lafaille of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in court.\n\n“We are running out of time to make this right. Each day that goes by is a day that she is being prevented from doing the work that she loves in the graduate program that she came here to be part of. Each day that this happens is a day that the government is allowed to continue to punish her for her protected speech.”\n\nÖztürk, meanwhile, has maintained a full course load and fulfilled all requirements to maintain her lawful student status, which the government hasn't terminated, her lawyer said.\n\nRecord created to collect information on international students\n\nSEVIS is mandated by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and administered by the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement “to collect information relating to nonimmigrant foreign students” and “use such information to carry out the enforcement functions of” ICE.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, when a SEVIS record is terminated, a student loses all on and/ or off-campus employment authorization and allows ICE agents to investigate to “confirm the departure of the student.”\n\nMcCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.",

    "description": "Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis show that psychedelic compounds such as psilocybin appear to distort the link between blood flow and brain-cell functioning, which scientists use to track brain activity.",
    "fullText": "Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug with promising clinical applications for treating mood disorders and substance abuse disorders. Recent work in functional MRI (fMRI) studies show that psychedelics can reset brain network activity — and it is thought that this effect, which can linger for days, might explain its therapeutic benefits.\n\nPsychedelics such as psilocybin act on a chemical in the brain called serotonin that controls the relaxation and contraction of blood vessels. Because fMRI uses changes in blood flow and blood oxygen levels in the brain as a proxy for brain activity, a team of WashU Medicine researchers set out to determine if these signals remained an accurate measure of brain activity in subjects dosed with a similar psychedelic that acts on the same chemicals.\n\nThey observed, in mice given this drug, that blood flow did not change as it normally would in relation to the activity of brain cells called neurons. When combined with a second medication that blocks a specific receptor in the brain that responds to serotonin, the blood flow effects from the psychedelic drug were removed.\n\nThe team’s subsequent studies using psilocybin in mice produced similar results to those observed with the first drug. Reanalyzing results from an earlier fMRI study in human subjects given psilocybin revealed similar effects on brain responses.\n\nThese results have important implications for how researchers interpret fMRI scans of brain activity in people who have taken psychedelics, and they may aid the scientific search for how psychedelics achieve their potential therapeutic effects.\n\nThe research was led by Adam Q. Bauer, an associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis’ Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology; Jordan G. McCall, an associate professor of anesthesiology in the Center for Clinical Pharmacology; and Joshua S. Siegel, MD, PhD, who conducted the work at WashU Medicine and is now an assistant professor at New York University. The study was published in Nature Neuroscience.\n\nTogether, the results from mice and humans indicate that the neurovascular effects of psychedelics need to be better understood when interpreting blood flow-dependent neuroimaging. As compounds like psilocybin are increasingly studied for treating conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder, treatment-resistant depression, substance abuse and stroke, understanding how psychedelics affect the reliability of brain scans as a proxy for brain activity is important for clinicians and researchers examining the effects of these drugs.",
