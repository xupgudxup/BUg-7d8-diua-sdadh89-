Danielle Sassoon testified for more than an hour as a defense lawyer tried to convince a judge that she had suggested that prosecutors would not criminally charge a woman with crimes related to the FTX cryptocurrency scandal if the woman’s boyfriend pleaded guilty.  Sassoon, who graduated from Harvard College in 2008 and from Yale Law School in 2011, was adamant that she never suggested such a deal and had gone to great lengths to insist to the woman’s lawyers that no deal like that was possible.",
