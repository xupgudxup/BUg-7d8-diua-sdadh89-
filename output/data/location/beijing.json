    "fullText": "SHANGHAI, Dec 17 (Reuters) - MetaX Integrated Circuits jumped 700% in its Shanghai market debut as the Chinese AI chipmaker tapped into strong momentum triggered by Beijing's push to reduce reliance on chips from U.S. firms Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nFounded by former AMD executives, MetaX raised roughly $600 million in an initial public ​offering last week, days after larger rival Moore Threads debuted with a 400% pop.\n\nMetaX opened at 700 yuan a share in Shanghai versus an IPO price of ‌104.66 yuan, before surging as high as 895 yuan, defying persistent AI bubble concerns in other markets. The stock ended the trading session at 829.9 yuan, up 693%.\n\n\"It's another IPO tale in China that turns a crow into ‌a phoenix,\" said fund manager Yang Tingwu at Tongheng Investment.\n\nThe price surge \"creates huge arbitrage opportunities\" for pre-IPO investors, Yang said, and \"we're likely witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years\".\n\nMakers of artificial intelligence (AI) chips are rushing to sell shares in China to capitalise on interest generated by a government drive to boost local production in competition with the U.S.\n\n\"AI and semiconductors are key areas of competition in the Sino-U.S. tech rivalry,\" Guotai Haitong Securities said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing. \"Against the backdrop of geopolitical tension, AI chipmaking has huge growth potential,\" as China seeks to achieve self-sufficiency.\n\nResearcher ⁠Frost & Sullivan forecast China AI chip sales to top $189 billion ‌by 2029 versus $54 billion in 2026.\n\nMetaX, which makes graphics processing units (GPUs), raised 4.2 billion yuan ($596 million) last week in a share sale that was more than 4,000 times oversubscribed by retail investors.\n\nThe IPO - China's sixth biggest so far this year, according to KPMG - priced the money-losing ‍startup at 50 times its 2024 sales. That compared with a multiple of 34 for Nvidia and 14 for AMD, MetaX said in a pre-listing statement.\n\nMetaX's debut catapulted the value of the five-year-old startup to more than 300 billion yuan ($42.58 billion) and boosted the wealth of founder and major shareholder Chen Weiliang, 49.\n\nAfter working for AMD Shanghai for 13 years, Chen founded MetaX with a mission to \"contribute to China's rejuvenation ​and national prosperity.\" The founding team also included Peng Li and Yang Jian, both former AMD engineers.\n\n\"The company is a leading GPU maker in China thanks to its AMD gene,\" ‌Li Hui, analyst at Huajin Securities, said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Thousands of people flocked to Tokyo's Ueno zoo to have a last glimpse of the popular twin pandas that are set to return to China next month, worried if or when they get to see their replacement in Japan as Tokyo's relations with Beijing sunk.\n\nThe Tokyo metropolitan government announced Monday that Xiao Xiao and his sister Lei Lei will return to China in late January and that their last day of public viewing will be Jan. 25.\n\nTheir departure will leave Japan without a panda for the first time in more than half a century. Prospects for their replacement are not favorable as ties between the two countries have plunged in recent weeks.\n\nGiant pandas are native to southwestern China and serve as an unofficial national mascot. Beijing lends them to other countries as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over them and any cubs they produce.\n\nYuki Imai, a panda fan visiting from the neighboring Kanagawa prefecture, said she was shocked by the news of the twins' return and decided to visit. “I thought I should come and see them soon while I still can.”\n\nMany queued for more than two hours to get to see the twins for one minute. Kazuhiro Yamamoto said he came to see the pandas with his wife Hiroko “for the one last time,” and that the twins may be returning sooner due to the rocky relations.\n\nThe four-year-old twins were born at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens in June, 2021, and raised there, but they remain on loan from China and must be returned by February.\n\nRelations between Japan and China have worsened since Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in early November that its military could get involved if China were to impose a naval blockade or other action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nChina has since restricted tourism to Japan, and cultural events and exchanges between local governments have been canceled.\n\nThe row escalated this month when Chinese drills involving an aircraft carrier near southern Japan prompted Tokyo to scramble fighter jets. Japan also protested that its aircraft were targeted by repeated radar-locking — a move considered as possible preparation for missile firing.\n\nTadashi Nakatani, a 51-year-old calligrapher at a temple who regularly visits from his hometown of Kamakura, west of Tokyo, said international relations may affect the panda diplomacy, but he has hope.\n\n“When things calm down and the relationship becomes stable, I sincerely hope that pandas will come again, and that a day will come when everyone can enjoy seeing them again.”\n\nChina sent the first pair of pandas to Japan in 1972 to mark the normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Since then, Japan has never been left without a panda.\n\nThousands of visitors formed a long line outside the zoo Tuesday morning. During their one-minute viewing time at the panda zone, visitors called out the twins’ names and took photos or videos as the pair nibbled bamboo sticks or strolled around.\n\nBeginning next week, only up to 4,800 visitors who successfully booked their 1-minute slot online will be able to see the beloved twins, according to the zoo.\n\nJapan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said Monday that pandas have long been loved by Japanese people and he hoped the friendship through panda diplomacy between the two countries will continue.\n\n“Exchanges through pandas have contributed to improve the public sentiment between Japan and China, and we hope the relationship will continue,” Kihara said. He noted that a number of local municipalities and zoos have expressed hope that new pandas will be loaned out soon.\n\nUeno Zoological Gardens curator Hitoshi Suzuki, referring to the panda twins, said raising them in good health was challenging. “But they gave us many kinds of joy and surprise. They also brought great delight to our visitors. We have nothing but words of gratitude.”\n\nThe zoo plans to promote other animals to make up for the absence of the pandas, while waiting for their replacement. “We will keep the panda area for the time being, so that we can accommodate possible new arrivals at any time.”",

The vessel, known as Puffer Fish Blue 01, developed by China's Wuhu Shipyard and Sandianshui New Energy Technology, had been certified by the China Classification Society, a professional body for ship classification, it added.\n\n\"Their investment and efforts to build pure electric container vessels show China's increasing influence in the global shipbuilding industry,\" said Xiong Hao, assistant general ­manager at Shanghai Jump International Shipping. \"It remains to be seen whether electric vessels will be widely accepted by global container liners.\"\n\nPeople visit a model of a nuclear-powered container ship at Marintec China 2025 in Shanghai on December 2, 2025.
