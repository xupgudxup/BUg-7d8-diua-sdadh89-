The vessel, known as Puffer Fish Blue 01, developed by China's Wuhu Shipyard and Sandianshui New Energy Technology, had been certified by the China Classification Society, a professional body for ship classification, it added.\n\n\"Their investment and efforts to build pure electric container vessels show China's increasing influence in the global shipbuilding industry,\" said Xiong Hao, assistant general ­manager at Shanghai Jump International Shipping. \"It remains to be seen whether electric vessels will be widely accepted by global container liners.\"\n\nPeople visit a model of a nuclear-powered container ship at Marintec China 2025 in Shanghai on December 2, 2025.
