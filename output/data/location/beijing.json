    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in the Chinese financial center of Shanghai on Friday in his bid to boost business opportunities for British firms in the world's second-largest economy, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible opposition to any deal between Beijing and London.\n\nWhy are foreign leaders increasing visits to Beijing?\n\nWhat agreement was reached on British lawmakers sanctions?\n\nWhat business opportunities is Starmer seeking in China?\n\nHow did Trump respond to UK-China negotiations?\n\nStarmer, the center-left Labour leader, has brought more than 50 business leaders on his trip to China, the first by a U.K. prime minister in eight years.\n\nStarmer suggested Trump’s criticism was aimed more at Canada than Britain. He added that Washington was aware in advance of his trip and its objectives and pointed out that Trump has said he plans to visit China this spring.\n\n“I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand,” Starmer told Sky News. “China is the second biggest economy in the world. Along with Hong Kong, it’s our third-biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation.”\n\nStarmer started his trip in Beijing on Thursday, where he met with Chinese leaders including Xi Jinping. The two pledged to pursue a long-term and stable strategic partnership in what was seen as a sign of improving ties after several years of friction between the two countries.\n\nIn Washington, Trump suggested that he may oppose any deal between Beijing and London, and then pivoted to Canada, with which he has had a series of sharp exchanges since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China earlier this month.\n\n“Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that,” he said, when asked about Starmer’s visit and any U.K. trade talks with Beijing. “And it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly.”\n\n“You can’t look at China as the answer,” he said.\n\nStarmer and Carney are among a series of foreign leaders to visit Beijing as their nations seek to improve ties with China. Many have seen their countries’ economies buffeted by Trump’s tariffs and are looking to expand other export markets.\n\nThe British prime minister said Xi agreed to remove a travel ban that had been imposed on several British lawmakers after the U.K.'s former center-right Conservative government joined the European Union, Canada and the U.S. in imposing sanctions on four Chinese officials over evidence of rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim people in the far western Xinjiang region.\n\n“This has been a cause of concern in Parliament and for parliamentarians for some time and that is why I raised it on this visit,\" Starmer told ITV News. “The response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit.”",

    "fullText": "PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama's president moved to assure the public on Friday that critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal will continue to operate without interruption — a day after the country’s Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison Holdings was unconstitutional.\n\nThe court's decision late Thursday advances a U.S. aim to block any influence by China over the strategic waterway and immediately drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing.\n\nPanamanian President José Raúl Mulino said that until the court's ruling is executed — a period of time he did not specify — Panama's Maritime Authority would work with Panama Ports Company, the CK Hutchison subsidiary, to ensure continuing operations at the port.\n\nOnce the concession is formally ended, a local subsidiary of Danish logistics company A.P. Moller-Maersk will operate the ports in a transitional phase until a new concession can be bid and awarded, Mulino said.\n\n“Panama moves forward, its ports will continue operating without interruption and we will continue serving the world at the logistics center of excellence that we are,” Mulino said in a recorded video address.\n\nThe court’s ruling followed an audit by Panama’s comptroller, which alleged irregularities in the 25-year extension of the concession, granted in 2021.\n\nThe Trump administration made blocking China’s influence over the Panama Canal one of its priorities in the hemisphere. Panama was U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s first overseas stop as the United States’ top diplomat. On Friday, Rubio said on X that “the United States is encouraged by the recent Panamanian Supreme Court’s decision to rule port concessions to China unconstitutional.”\n\nDespite the insistence by Panama’s government and the canal authority that China has no influence over its operations, Rubio made clear that the U.S. viewed the operation of the ports as a national security issue. U.S. President Donald Trump had gone so far as to say Panama should return the canal to U.S. control.\n\nThe court’s brief statement gave no guidance on what would happen to the ports now.\n\nThe ruling draws backlash from Hong Kong\n\nCK Hutchison’s subsidiary, Panama Ports Company, said it has not been notified yet about the decision but insisted its concession was the result of transparent international bidding.\n\nIt said in its statement that the ruling “lacks legal basis and jeopardizes not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity, but also the rule of law and legal certainty in the country.”\n\nIt said that it reserves all rights to proceed legally in Panama or elsewhere, but gave no more details.\n\nThe Hong Kong government firmly rejected the ruling in a statement, saying it strongly opposes any foreign government using coercive, repressive or other unreasonable means to seriously harm the business interests of Hong Kong enterprises. It said the Panamanian government should respect the spirit of contracts and provide a fair business environment.\n\n“Given the current situation in Panama, Hong Kong enterprises should carefully review their existing and future investments there,\" it said.\n\nIn Beijing, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told reporters that China would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of “the Chinese company,” without elaborating on the potential steps.\n\nPolitical analyst Edwin Cabrera said once the parties are notified, the issue of what to do with the ports goes to Panama’s executive branch, specifically the Panama Maritime Authority.\n\n“I have the impression from conversations that I have had with some people that the operation (of the ports) will not stop,” Cabrera said.\n\nA sale deal that apparently angered Beijing\n\nCK Hutchison Holdings announced a deal last year to sell its majority stake in the Panamanian ports and others around the world to an international consortium that included BlackRock Inc. But the deal appeared to stall over objections by the Chinese government.\n\nThe company said last July that it was considering seeking a Chinese investor to join as a significant member of the consortium, a move that some interpreted as way to please Beijing, but CK Hutchison hasn't said more since.\n\nThe awkward position the company found itself in highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing.\n\nLast year, Panama’s comptroller audited the concession to the Panama Ports Company, which had held the contract to operate the ports since 1997. The concession was renewed in 2021 for 25 years, during the prior Panamanian administration.\n\nComptroller Anel Flores said the audit found payments that were not made, accounting errors and the apparent existence of “ghost” concessions operating within the ports since 2015. The company denied those allegations.\n\nThe audit determined that the irregularities had cost the government about $300 million since the concession was extended and an estimated $1.2 billion during the original 25-year contract.\n\nFlores also said the extension was granted without the required endorsement of his office.\n\nOn July 30, the comptroller challenged the Panama Ports Company’s contract to operate the ports before the Supreme Court.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China's main space contractor vowed to develop space tourism in the next five years, state media reported on Thursday, as Beijing revs up its commercial spaceflight and deep space exploration ambitions ​amid a technology race with the U.S.\n\nState-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) said it would \"achieve the flight operation of ‌suborbital space tourism and gradually develop orbital space tourism,\" as well as \"build a gigawatt-level space digital intelligence infrastructure\", state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n\nChina and the U.S. are competing ‌as they look to turn space exploration into a commercially viable business similar to civil aviation, as well as becoming the first to exploit the military and strategic advantages of space dominance. CASC has vowed to transform China into a \"world-leading space power\" by 2045.\n\nBeijing's key bottleneck so far is its failure to complete a reusable rocket test. U.S. rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable rocket has allowed its subsidiary Starlink to ⁠achieve a near-monopoly on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites ‌and it is also used for orbital space tourism.\n\nReusability is crucial to lowering the costs of rocket launches and making it cheaper to send satellites into space. China achieved a record 93 space launches ‍last year, according to official announcements, buoyed by its rapidly maturing commercial spaceflight startups.\n\nHowever, China has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on LEO satellites as a national security risk and is launching its own satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the next decades.\n\nIn late ​December, Chinese entities submitted filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) laying out plans to put about 200,000 satellites in orbit over ‌the next 14 years. Two mega-constellations account for the vast majority, and the move would strategically reserve suborbital slots and frequencies for Beijing.\n\nCASC's plans were announced after China inaugurated its first School of Interstellar Navigation housed in the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, aiming to foster the next generation of space talent in frontier fields including interstellar propulsion and deep space navigation.\n\nThe new institution signals China's ambitions to strategically transition from near-Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration, and will support China's planned lunar research station and efforts in ⁠detecting planets outside our solar system, according to a Xinhua report on ​the inauguration.\n\n\"The next 10 to 20 years will be a window for leapfrog ​development in China's interstellar navigation field. Original innovation in basic research and technological breakthroughs will reshape the pattern of deep space exploration,\" Xinhua wrote.\n\nThursday's CCTV report said CASC would also focus on breakthroughs in key technologies ‍such as small celestial resource exploration ⁠and intelligent independent mining and step up monitoring of space debris and the formulation of international space traffic management rules.\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was the first spacecraft to bring back samples from the far side of the moon in 2024, and ⁠Beijing is actively setting international standards for spaceflight and space infrastructure to establish itself as a dominant space power.\n\nThe U.S. faces intense competition this decade from ‌China in its effort to return astronauts to the moon, where no humans have gone since the final U.S. ‌Apollo mission in 1972.",

    "fullText": "Beijing’s AI policy is focused on real-life applications but Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions\n\nStanding on stage in the eastern China tech hub of Hangzhou, Alibaba’s normally media-shy CEO made an attention-grabbing announcement. “The world today is witnessing the dawn of an AI-driven intelligent revolution,” Eddie Wu told a developer conference in September. “Artificial general intelligence (AGI) will not only amplify human intelligence but also unlock human potential, paving the way for the arrival of artificial superintelligence (ASI).”\n\nASI, Wu said, “could produce a generation of ‘super scientists’ and ‘full-stack super engineers’”, who would “tackle unsolved scientific and engineering problems at unimaginable speeds”.\n\nWu also announced plans to invest 380bn yuan (£40bn) in AI infrastructure over the next three years, news that sent Alibaba stocks soaring to their highest in nearly four years.\n\nWu’s foray into the existential, techno-frontier rhetoric normally deployed by western tech CEOs such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis caught the attention of observers. “Wu’s ASI speech represents a breakthrough,” the tech writer Afra Wang wrote in her China AI newsletter, Concurrent. “Major Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions that carry the flavour of future prophecy.”\n\nAGI, a theoretical state of AI where a highly autonomous system is able to do a human’s job, has become the preoccupation of American tech companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind. Many see it as the next frontier of civilisation, and are in competition with each other, and China, to get there. In May, the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, told a US Senate committee on AI that the “race between the United States and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover”.\n\nMany in Washington have internalised these fears. The US-China economic and scurity review commission has recommended that Congress “establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an artificial general intelligence (AGI) capability”. The Manhattan Project was a second world war-era research operation to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nIn China, many saw Wu’s speech as articulating the vision of a bold, singular tech company, but not one that represented China’s overall AI industry.\n\n“China certainly has research groups working towards AGI. But most AI companies are working towards better applications,” said Ya-Qin Zhang, the dean of Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI Industry Research and former president of the tech company Baidu.\n\nA combination of limited computing power, a pragmatic approach to technology and a keen awareness of the present day potential of AI has steered China’s national AI policy towards real-life applications rather than frontier research.\n\nIn August, the Chinese government published its highly anticipated “AI+ strategy”. The policy document outlined how AI could turbocharge China’s development goals, such as by using AI to improve medical diagnoses and make supply chains more efficient. But it made no mention of AGI.\n\n“The Chinese government is intently focused on reaping the benefits of AI in the here and now and in the near future through diffusion and application of AI across the economy, society, defence, and other areas,” said Julian Gewirtz, a former senior director for China and Taiwan at the White House national security council. “Despite its goal to ‘catch up and surpass’ the United States, we shouldn’t assume that the Chinese Communist party has bought into the idea that AGI is imminent.”\n\n“If you’re just looking at what has been officially published … there is no clear acknowledgment of AGI at all,” said Selina Xu, a China tech analyst. Xu noted that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, had a history of preferring the physical economy to more intangible forces.\n\n“It’s a very different narrative from the AGI race as a lot of people in DC see it,” Xu said.\n\nOne of the biggest factors guiding this strategy is the fact that US sanctions have prevented Chinese companies from acquiring the world’s most sophisticated semiconductors, which are needed for advanced AI research.\n\nWashington has banned the sale of hi-tech microchips to China in an effort to rein in the country’s AI development. Nvidia, the world’s leading chipmaker, then developed more basic semiconductors specifically for the Chinese market. In December, Washington approved the Nvidia’s second-most advanced chips, the H200s, for sale in China. But Beijing has reportedly told custom agents that the chips cannot be imported into China, as the government seeks to break the country’s reliance on overseas technology.\n\nChina insists that “necessity is the mother of invention” and points to the success of companies such as DeepSeek as proof that the US restrictions will merely spur innovation. DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, is one of the few Chinese tech leaders who, like Alibaba’s Wu, has openly expressed an interest in AGI.\n\nBut until China is able to produce its own advanced semiconductors at scale, most tech companies feel it is more profitable to use the hardware they already have to focus on AI applications rather than AGI.\n\nAnother factor guiding the US-China tech competition is the availability of datacentres and the energy to power them. In November, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, said China would “win the AI race” in part because of its energy subsidies for datacentres.\n\nThe subsidies were reportedly introduced after Chinese tech companies complained of higher electricity bills caused by the domestic semiconductors they are obliged to use, which are less efficient than Nvidia’s. In a sign of how determined China is to break its reliance on imported technology, Reuters reported that any datacentres in receipt of state funds could only use domestic chips.\n\nSuch measures would reduce Nvidia’s competitive advantage in China and boost domestic chip producers, such as Huawei.\n\nSince 2021, China has reportedly poured $100bn into support for AI datacentres.\n\nBut there are signs that the boom may have been overzealous. A recent report from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology said that nationwide, the utilisation rate for AI datacentres was 32%.\n\nIn a recent op-ed in China Economic Weekly, Rao Shaoyang, the director at the China Telecom Research Institute, wrote that in some regions of China, the computing power industry was operating in a similar fashion to China’s beleaguered property sector: build first, find buyers later. He cautioned against “blindly building intelligent computing centres” and said local computing power demand should be considered before building new datacentres.\n\nDespite the surplus in more general computing power, many experts believe China still does not have chips that are sophisticated enough to explore frontier research in AGI. But analysts note that the mood could change quickly.\n\n“The current status quo is highly fluid, and Xi Jinping has explicitly declared an ambition to lead the world in AI,” said Gewirtz. “So the fact that China construes that goal one way at this snapshot moment in time does not give me any comfort that in a year they’re going to construe it the same way.”\n\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang",

    "fullText": "TOKYO/BEIJING, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Japan's strategic alliance with the U.S. would collapse if Tokyo were to turn away from a conflict in Taiwan, but ​distanced herself from previous comments that suggested a possible military response in such an event.\n\nTakaichi expressed ‌her latest views on a nationally broadcast TV programme late on Monday, where an opposition party leader criticised her for igniting ‌tensions with China with the earlier remarks.\n\nTies between Japan and China have sunk to the worst level in years after Takaichi said in November that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could bring about a Japanese military response. Beijing has responded with export curbs, flight cancellations and vitriolic commentaries, repeatedly demanding a retraction.\n\nChina claims sovereignty ⁠over the democratically-governed island of Taiwan.\n\n“I ‌want to make it absolutely clear that this is not about Japan going out and taking military action if China and the United States come into conflict (over ‍Taiwan),\" Takaichi said on the live TV show, referring to the comments she made in parliament in November.\n\n\"If something serious happens there, we would have to go to rescue the Japanese and American citizens in Taiwan. In that situation, ​there may be cases where we take joint action.\n\n\"And if the U.S. forces, acting jointly with us, ‌come under attack and Japan does nothing and simply runs away, the Japan–U.S. alliance would collapse. So we would respond strictly within the limits of the law — within the limits of the laws as they currently exist — while making a comprehensive judgment based on what is happening on the ground.\"\n\nJAPAN'S CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS DIRECT MILITARY ACTION\n\nWith an eye on the electorate, Takaichi has stopped short of retracting the ⁠remarks from November, saying her stance was consistent with ​Japan's long-standing policy. She has also said that China’s characterisation of ​her remarks was inconsistent with the facts.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday urged Japan to \"earnestly reflect and correct its mistakes, and to stop its manipulation and reckless actions on ‍the Taiwan issue.\"\n\nJapan's pacifist constitution ⁠prohibits direct military action but allows it to exercise the right of collective self-defence, or defending the United States or another friendly country that comes under attack, in cases where Japan faces ⁠a \"threat to its survival.\"\n\nTakaichi has enjoyed high approval ratings since taking office in October 2025 and has called a snap election ‌on February 8, hoping to capitalise on her popularity.",

    "fullText": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines told China on Monday that it is alarmed about heated exchanges with Chinese diplomats in Manila over the long-standing, seething territorial dispute between the two countries in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said without elaborating that it “made firm representations to the Chinese ambassador and the Chinese Embassy conveying serious concerns with the escalation of public exchanges.\"\n\nIt warned that the bruising, tit-for-tat exchanges with China could “unnecessarily derail the diplomatic space needed to manage the tensions in the maritime domain,\" but, nevertheless, expressed support to Philippine officials, including some senators, who have defended their country's territorial interests in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing last week said it summoned Philippine Ambassador Jaime FlorCruz to protest remarks by Philippine coast guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela, one of the most vocal critics of China’s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters.\n\nChina has claimed virtually the entire waterway, a key global trade route, despite a 2016 arbitration ruling that invalidated Beijing’s expansive claims based on the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. Beijing did not participate in the arbitration, which was initiated by the Philippines in 2013 after a territorial confrontation, and continues to defy the decision.\n\nVietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have been involved in the territorial standoffs.\n\nConfrontations in the high seas have particularly spiked in recent years between China and the Philippines. Unlike other claimants, the Philippine government has openly condemned China’s growing assertive actions in the disputed waters and publicized videos and pictures of the use of powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers by China’s forces.\n\n“We reiterate our previous statements affirming support for our officials to perform their lawful duties in defense of Philippine sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction,” the Foreign Affairs department in Manila said. “Their views, as well as those of disagreeing voices, are an inescapable part of the robust plurality of ideas that animate our democratic society.\"\n\nThe Chinese Embassy has protested remarks by Tarriela, who it said has “persistently hyped up maritime issues, confounded right and wrong, misrepresented facts, incited confrontation, misled public opinion, undermined China’s national interests and dignity, impacted mutual trust.”\n\n“I firmly reject your ignorant and arrogant views,” Chinese Embassy deputy spokesperson Guo Wei said of Tarriela in a recent statement.\n\nTarriela responded by chiding Guo Wei in a social media post.\n\n“I am beginning to think you are enjoying to use the social media platforms here in the Philippines because you do not have such freedom in your country,\" he wrote.\n\nPhilippine Sen. Risa Hontiveros said in a speech Monday that Chinese diplomats have violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations when they publicly censured and tried to restrain Filipino officials’ views and criticisms in their own country.\n\nHontiveros also has called the Chinese Embassy “a bad guest” in the Philippines.\n\nIn a criticism of Hontiveros, the Chinese diplomatic mission in Manila recently said it has no intention of silencing anybody in the country, but it would respond to any attempt to “smear” China and its leaders.\n\n“Are you really advocating the interest of the Philippines and the Filipinos? Or are you simply pursuing your own political gains?” the Chinese Embassy asked Hontiveros, who has been seen as a possible contender in the 2028 presidential and vice presidential elections.",

    "description": "The U.S. speed skater tells PEOPLE about her and Team USA hockey star Hilary Knight's first dates during the 2022 Winter Olympics",
    "fullText": "Nearly a decade into her competitive speed skating career, Brittany Bowe finally achieved her dream of standing on an Olympic podium at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nBut when you ask her about her memories of that time, she’s quick to point out that it was actually falling for girlfriend Hilary Knight that stands out the most.\n\n“That was the biggest win coming out of Beijing for sure,” Bowe, 37, tells PEOPLE about meeting her partner, the U.S. women’s ice hockey captain, that February.\n\n“Hilary and I have known each other for a number of years through different Team USA events, a number of different Olympics, but that's the first time we really did have time to connect and get to know one another,” Bowe says. “And it was everything other than glamorous, that's for sure! Hilary would ask, like, ‘Oh, do you want to go for a walk after dinner?’ And that was our first date, going to walk around the Olympic Village masked because everyone was so fearful of getting COVID.”\n\nSoon, the couple’s walking dates became dinner dates.\n\n“[It was] a very unique way to meet someone, but it was also kind of cool because we felt like we were in this bubble,” Bowe recalls. “We didn't have the family, the friends, no outside distractions. And we really had a lot of time just to get to know each other.”\n\nFour years later, the two share a home in Salt Lake City, and will soon be packing their bags for what may be each of their final Winter Olympics. (They'll be leaving behind the fancy handmade Italian coffee machine they recently purchased to prepare for the trip: “We've been watching hours of videos,” Knight laughed to PEOPLE.)\n\nNow, however, their focus will both be on bringing home medals as part of Team USA – Bowe as a veteran member of the U.S. speed skating squad, and Knight as the captain of the U.S. women’s hockey team.\n\nBowe is excited for the 2026 Winter Games — particularly the return to fans in the stands, as they were still barred from attending in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“I know both of our families are really excited to watch both of us compete,” Bowe says. “My family's already got their hockey tickets, and her family's getting the speed skating tickets. So, just to have more people in the stands that love you, support you, are part of your journey — that will make it really special.”\n\nA Florida native who first took up inline skating after a local coach noticed her gliding down the rink at a friend’s birthday party, Bowe didn’t seriously consider ice skating until she found herself watching old friends from her inline days compete for Team USA at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\n“My path to the Olympics is definitely not linear,” says the former Florida Atlantic University point guard, who set aside her plans to make it to the WNBA after becoming infatuated with ice skating during those 2010 Winter Games.\n\nDespite not being “an adrenaline junkie at all” when she’s off the ice, \"I love pushing myself to the limit\" in competition, Bowe says. She adds that winning is “an addiction” that gives her “no better feeling in the world.”\n\nAnd when the 2026 Winter Olympics come to a close, regardless of the outcome, her lifelong dream of having an Olympic career will have been accomplished.\n\n“More than anything, [I’m excited about] just being able to compete and represent my country,” Bowe says. “I can't think of a better way to end my career than with the flag on me and my family in the stands.”\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

    "description": "China's most senior general is under investigation, China's defence ministry said on Saturday, in the highest-profile purge to date of senior military leadership just as Beijing",
    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - China's most senior general is under investigation, China's defence ministry said on Saturday, in the highest-profile purge to date of senior military leadership just as Beijing modernises its forces and tries to further project its might.\n\nZhang Youxia serves as second-in-command under President Xi Jinping as vice-chairman of the Central ​Military Commission - the supreme command body - and has long been seen as Xi's closest military ally.\n\nThe ministry said Zhang and Liu Zhenli, chief of staff of the ‌CMC's Joint Staff Department, were under investigation for suspected serious violations of discipline and law.\n\nZhang is also a member of the elite Politburo of the ruling Communist Party and is one of just a few leading officers with ‌combat experience.\n\nSWEEPING CRACKDOWN TARGETS MILITARY\n\nThe military was one of the main targets of a broad corruption crackdown ordered by Xi in 2012. That drive reached the upper echelons of the People's Liberation Army in 2023 when the elite Rocket Force was targeted.\n\nZhang's removal is the second of a sitting general on the Central Military Commission since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. He has not been seen in public since November 20, when he held talks with Russia's defence minister in Moscow.\n\nForeign diplomats and security analysts are watching developments closely, given Zhang's closeness to Xi and the importance of the commission's work ⁠in terms of command as well as the PLA's ongoing ‌military modernisation and posture.\n\nWhile China has not fought a war in decades, it is taking an increasingly muscular line in the disputed East China Sea and South China Sea, as well as over the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which is claimed by China. Beijing staged the ‍largest military exercises to date around Taiwan late last year.\n\nSingapore-based China security scholar James Char said the military's daily operations could carry on as normal despite the purges but the targeting of Zhang showed Xi was reacting to criticism that the crackdown had been too selective.\n\n\"Xi has been tapping on second-line PLA officers to fill those roles vacated by their predecessors – on an interim basis in most cases,\" said Char, ​a scholar at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n\n\"China’s military modernizers will continue to push for the two goals Xi has set for the PLA – namely, 2035 to basically complete ‌its modernisation and 2049 to become a world-class armed forces.\"\n\nZhang is the second vice chair of the CMC to fall from grace in recent months. Former CMC vice chair He Weidong was expelled from the party and PLA in October last year for corruption. He was replaced by Zhang Shengmin.\n\nEight top generals were expelled from the Communist Party on graft charges in October 2025, including He Weidong.\n\nTwo former defence ministers were also purged from the ruling party in recent years for corruption. The crackdown is slowing procurement of advanced weaponry and hitting the revenues of some of China's biggest defence firms.\n\nBoth Xi and Zhang are from the northwestern province of Shaanxi and are the children of former senior officials who fought together ⁠in the 1940s civil war.\n\nBorn in Beijing, Zhang joined the army in 1968, rising through the ranks ​and joining the military commission in late 2012 as the PLA's modernisation drive gathered pace.\n\nA Pentagon profile of Zhang ​in late 2023 noted that Zhang had been expected to retire in 2022, aged 72, given usual military practice.\n\n\"However, Zhang's retention on the CMC for a third term probably reflects Xi's desire to keep a close and experienced ally as his top military adviser,\" the profile said, contained within the ‍Pentagon's annual report on China's military that year.\n\nHe ⁠fought Vietnam in a brief but bloody border war in 1979 that China launched in punishment for Vietnam invading Cambodia the previous year and ousting the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge.\n\nZhang was 26 when he was sent to the front lines to fight the Vietnamese and was quickly promoted, according to state media. He also fought in another border ⁠clash with Vietnam in 1984 as the conflict rumbled on.\n\n\"During the battle, whether attacking or defending, Zhang Youxia performed excellently,\" the official China Youth Daily wrote in a 2017 piece entitled, \"These Chinese generals have killed the enemy ‌on the battlefield\".\n\nSome China scholars have noted that Zhang emerged from the conflict an avowed moderniser in terms of military tactics, weapons and the need for ‌a better trained force.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Tesla is poised to be one of the first automakers to benefit from Canada's move to remove 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, thanks to its early efforts to ship cars from its Shanghai plant there and its established ​Canadian sales network, experts say.\n\nUnder the deal announced last Friday, Canada will allow up to 49,000 vehicles to be imported annually ‌from China with a tariff of 6.1% on most-favoured nation terms. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the quota could rise to reach 70,000 vehicles within five years.\n\nHowever, under one clause ‌in the agreement, half of the quota will be reserved for vehicles under 35,000 CAD ($25,189). Tesla model prices are all above that number.\n\nWhile many Chinese automakers will be keen to seize the opportunity as they expand exports, Tesla has an advantage as it in 2023 already equipped its Shanghai plant, its biggest and most cost-efficient factory globally, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.\n\nThe U.S. automaker had that same year started shipping the car ⁠from Shanghai to Canada, boosting Canadian imports of automobiles ‌from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023.\n\nBut it was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its U.S. and Berlin factories after Ottawa imposed 100% tariffs, citing ‍a wish to counter what they called China's intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity.\n\nNow, it ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants such as cheaper Model 3s are mostly built in China.\n\n\"This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather quickly,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions.\n\nTesla ​has an existing network of 39 stores in Canada, whereas Chinese rivals such as BYD and Nio do not yet have a sales presence ‌there, and it can also likely move faster with marketing plans as it only has four core models, far fewer than its Chinese competitors.\n\n\"Tesla indeed has an advantage with its offering of a few models, versions and simple production lines so that it can be flexible to sell cars produced in any country in any markets to achieve the best cost efficiency,\" said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.\n\nOther brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included Volvo and Polestar, which are both ⁠owned by China's automaking group Geely.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — A week in which longtime tensions between neighbors China and Japan ratcheted up economically and politically drew to a close with no sign of improvements Friday as the Chinese ambassador in Tokyo rebuffed his host nation and the Japanese reported delayed shipments to suppliers in China because of the spat.\n\nThe two developments capped a week where China made clear its displeasure with Japan by instituting new export controls, condemning what it called Tokyo's renewed militarism and cozying up to another regional neighbor, South Korea, during its leader's visit to Beijing.\n\nOn Friday, the Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, kept the jabs coming.\n\n“New militarism will lead Japan back into the abyss,” it said in an editorial. “History serves as a stark warning, yet the Japanese right wing is repeating its old tricks.”\n\nIt was the latest in several days of pointed Chinese criticism toward Japan after its prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested in November that she wouldn't rule out intervening if China used military force against the island of Taiwan. China views self-governed Taiwan as its sovereign territory and has said it would take it by force if needed. It staged large-scale military exercises nearby late last month.\n\nChina keeps its export controls\n\nOn Thursday night, the Chinese embassy in Japan said it had rejected a petition from Japan's Foreign Ministry to retract the new export controls on “dual-use items” that the Japanese military might be able to use in weaponry. The ambassador, Wu Jianghao, insisted that China's move was “entirely legitimate, reasonable and lawful” — and vital to national security.\n\nAlso Friday, Japanese officials said they are closely watching if Japanese exports of agricultural, fisheries and other goods are appropriately handled by China without delays. The Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that outgoing shipments of sake and processed food from Japan to China were being held up because of the diplomatic tensions, widening the ripples of the dispute.\n\nOfficials at the government-affiliated Japan External Trade Organization told The Associated Press that the shipments had been delayed in customs on the China side starting in late November. Kyodo, quoting trade industry sources, said they believed sake may have been targeted as “a symbol of Japan.”\n\nJapan’s chief cabinet secretary, Minoru Kihara, said he was aware of reports that some of the Japanese exports to China have been held up. He wouldn’t comment on individual commercial transactions.\n\n“It is important that agricultural, fisheries and other exports from Japan are smoothly carried out,” Kihara said. “We will closely watch the situation and take appropriate measures.” He didn’t say what those might be.\n\nJapan and China have a fraught history haunted by the Japanese colonization of Taiwan in 1895. The nations have fought two wars, and the imperial government in Tokyo brutally occupied parts of China in the first half of the 20th century. The countries maintain diplomatic relations and work closely together on many fronts but occasionally use government apparatus to condemn each other when disputes arise.\n\nChina's choice of wording in the People's Daily editorial and other rhetoric was noteworthy. It avoided casting a broad brush on the Japanese people and specifically targeted the country's right wing, which Takaichi belongs to. A report Thursday about Japan's nuclear ambitions repeatedly mentioned the right wing, and the People's Daily editorial beseeched the “peace-loving Japanese people” to be “highly vigilant” toward their government.\n\n\"Japan’s future lies not in the dangerous fantasies painted by the right wing, but in the thorough reckoning with its history of aggression,\" People's Daily said.\n\nRare earths as a pressure point\n\nKihara, the government spokesman, said Chinese export controls of rare earths already in place have caused “serious impact on global supply chains.” “We believe that international trade of rare earths should be carried out smoothly,\" Kihara said.\n\nIndustry and Trade Minister Ryosei Akazawa did not confirm whether China’s dual-use goods ban included new action on rare earths. Azakawa said the impact on Japanese industries is already significant because about 70% of rare earths, used in a wide range of products such as electronic parts and autos, are imported from China.\n\n“Rare earths are extremely important minerals, and the export controls have already affected our country tremendously,” Akazawa said. He wouldn't comment on whether Japan would consider retaliating.\n\nChina also pointedly expressed positive feelings about South Korea during the visit this week of its president, Lee Jae Myung, who met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. After the signing of millions in new export contracts, Lee heralded “a new chapter in the development of Korea-China relations.\"\n\nAs he visited, Chinese state media — which recently warned that travel to Japan by Chinese citizens might be dangerous — provided splashy coverage and said outgoing Chinese traveler to South Korea during New Year's had surpassed those to Japan.\n\nRelations between Beijing and Tokyo showed at least one tiny positive sign Friday. At a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing, spokesperson Mao Ning was informed that a one-time Japanese ambassador to China had died. She expressed the country's condolences.",

    "description": "When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words.  After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words. But no small part of that oil belongs to China under contracts it struck with Caracas years ago, setting the stage for a delicate diplomatic dance in the next few weeks.\n\nSome experts expect Trump to work with China in an effort to stabilize trade relations. After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.\n\n“The administration appears focused on avoiding unnecessary escalation or new irritants with Beijing while keeping leverage firmly on Washington’s terms,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nHe added that he doubted Trump would risk turning Venezuela into a “flashpoint that complicates trade dynamics or Trump’s personal engagement with Xi.”\n\nChina is owed at least $10 billion from Venezuela, according to various estimates, a debt that former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had paid down by shipping oil to China. It is possible that the interim Venezuelan government complying with Washington’s demands could question the legality of those loans-for-oil deals and cease payments.\n\nTwo major Chinese state-owned enterprises — China National Petroleum Corp. and Sinopec — are entitled to 4.4 billion barrels of oil reserves in Venezuela, the highest for any foreign country, according to a research note by the investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nU.S. companies also have claims for tens of billions of dollars from when Caracas nationalized the oil industry, and it’s not clear how these IOUs will be honored and in what order.\n\nThe U.S. seized two sanctioned oil tankers this week as part of a plan to assert control over Venezuelan oil shipments. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will handle the sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely,” depositing proceeds into U.S.-controlled accounts that will ultimately “flow back into Venezuela to benefit the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThe administration said this week that the U.S. would kickstart those sales with 30 million to 50 million barrels taken from the South American country’s crude storage facilities. Asked for more detail, a Trump administration official not authorized to comment publicly and speaking on condition of anonymity said U.S. policy was to wind down “adversarial outside influence” in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe U.S. using such leverage over a crucial natural resource comes after Beijing flexed its muscles last year by choking off critical supplies of rare-earth magnets and weaponizing its purchase of American soybeans in the trade war with Washington. When Trump met Xi in South Korea in October, the two men agreed to a one-year truce, backing off from sky-high tariffs and export controls on each other.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2023, Venezuela was the fourth-largest recipient of Beijing's official credit, having received $106 billion worth of loans from China’s official-sector creditors, according to AidData, a research lab at Virginia's College of William & Mary that tracks Beijing's overseas lending activities. But how much of the total that Caracas has paid off and what is still owed is unclear, said AidData executive director Brad Parks, because Caracas stopped reporting debt details several years ago.\n\nWhile some estimates put the outstanding debt at $10 billion, Parks said the figure could be much higher because U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil might have delayed loan repayments. The loans from China, under an unusual arrangement, were set up to be paid down with proceeds from oil exports.\n\nIn China, the capture of Maduro evoked memories of another leader who had struck deals with Chinese companies and then suddenly lost power: Libya's Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nAfter the 2011 fall of Gadhafi, Chinese businesses had to leave behind billions in investments. Cui Shoujun, professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing, told the Chinese news and commentary site guancha.cn that the transition government in Caracas could deem agreements under Maduro unlawful and the debt to China illegal.\n\nAs in Libya, Beijing’s stakes in Venezuela have gone beyond oil. Chinese firms have invested in telecommunications, railways and ports in Venezuela, all now at risk, according to a report by the global financial firm Jefferies.\n\nStill, the firm noted that Beijing will likely manage any disruption because Venezuelan oil counted for only a small percentage of China's oil imports and because Beijing has diversified its energy supplies and pivoted to electrification.\n\nHours before he was captured by U.S. forces, Maduro hosted a high-level Chinese diplomat at the presidential palace and praised the countries' ties that had prospered from the days of his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, and given Beijing a strong foothold in America's backyard.\n\nVenezuela is the only Latin American country that has a high-level strategic partnership with China, on par with close friends like Pakistan, and the ouster of Maduro is expected to curtail China's influence in the Western Hemisphere — in line with one of the goals spelled out in the Trump administration's National Security Strategy.\n\nBeijing's response to the capture of Maduro\n\nSoon after Maduro was captured, Beijing said it was “deeply shocked” by the blatant use of U.S. force against a sovereign state and action against its president and said it “strongly” condemned the U.S. actions. It called for the immediate release of Maduro and his wife.\n\nChinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said Thursday that no nation has the right to interfere with economic and trade cooperation between China and Venezuela, which he said is between two sovereign states and protected by international and domestic laws.\n\n“No matter how the political situation in Venezuela evolves, China’s willingness to deepen bilateral economic and trade cooperation will not change,” He said.\n\nSingleton said Beijing does not wield the clout in the Western Hemisphere as touted.\n\n“Beijing can protest diplomatically,” he said, “but it cannot protect partners or assets once Washington decides to apply direct pressure.”",

It comes at a time of heightened tensions between China and Japan, after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in November that her country’s military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan.\n\nChina's official news agency Xinhua reported on Sunday afternoon that Lee arrived in Beijing. During his stay, Lee will meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, their second meeting in just two months.\n\nLee signals commitment to China's ties\n\nAhead of his trip, Lee gave an interview to China's state broadcaster CCTV at Seoul's Cheong Wa Dae, the presidential office also known as the Blue House. Lee was quoted as saying that it was his first interview held in the presidential palace and that he hoped people would understand that his government cares about the relations between Beijing and Seoul.\n\nIn the interview, he assured that South Korea consistently respects the “One-China” policy when it comes to Taiwan, CCTV reported Friday. He said the healthy development of Beijing-Seoul relations depends on mutual respect. Lee also praised Xi as a “truly reliable neighbor.\"\n\nLast week, China staged large-scale military drills around the island for two days to warn against separatist and “external interference” forces. At that time, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Taiwan’s ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support.\n\nThe U.S. planned large-scale arms sales to Taiwan angered Beijing in December, leading to China sanctioning 20 U.S. defense-related companies.\n\nLee said Seoul's cooperation with the U.S, its military ally, does not mean South Korea-China relations should move toward confrontation, CCTV reported. He acknowledged that past misunderstandings between his country and China had hindered bilateral relations.\n\n“This visit to China aims to minimize or eliminate these past misunderstandings or contradictions, to elevate and develop South Korea-China relations to a new stage,” CCTV quoted him as saying.\n\nTo discuss the Korean Peninsula and strengthen economic ties\n\nSouth Korea and the U.S. have urged China, North Korea’s traditional ally and economic pipeline, to use its influence on its socialist neighbor to convince it to return to talks or abandon its nuclear program.\n\nBut China has long been suspected of avoiding fully implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help the North stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against U.S. influence on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nOn Sunday, North Korea launched multiple ballistic missiles toward the sea, South Korea’s military said, the latest weapons demonstration by the North ahead of its upcoming ruling party congress.\n\nLee’s visit is meant to strengthen bilateral ties and discuss ways to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula, South Korean officials said.\n\nDuring Monday’s summit, Lee and Xi are to hold “in-depth talks on substantive ways” to address security and economic issues facing the two countries, South Korea’s national security adviser Wi Sung-lac told a briefing Friday. On Tuesday, Lee is to meet Zhao Leji, chairman of the National People’s Congress, and Premier Li Qiang, Wi said.\n\nDuring Lee’s trip, South Korea will also request that China play “a constructive role” in efforts to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula, Wi said. In their November talks, Lee already asked Xi to make greater efforts to persuade North Korea to return to talks.\n\nSouth Korea would push for substantial achievements that could directly benefit ordinary citizens in both countries too, Wi said.\n\nKim reported from Seoul, South Korea",

    "fullText": "USA Hockey unveiled the roster of NHL stars for next month's Winter Olympics on Friday, a 25-man lineup that includes 21 players from last year's emotional Four Nations Face-Off.\n\nLast February's NHL-backed Face-Off event included three fights in the first nine seconds between border rivals United States and Canada, tensions heightened by political matters including President Donald Trump's talk of making Canada the 51st American state.\n\nCanada defeated the US squad in the Face-Off final.\n\nBrothers Matthew Tkachuk of Florida and Brady Tkachuk of Ottawa, who dropped gloves in the first two on-ice Four Nations fights last year against Canada, and fellow forward J.T. Miller, involved in the third, were named to the US lineup for Milan.\n\nOther US front-liners include Toronto's Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel of Vegas, New Jersey's Jack Hughes, Tampa Bay's Jake Guentzel, Detroit's Dylan Larkin, Winnipeg's Kyle Connor, Colorado's Brock Nelson, Minnesota's Matt Boldy and Miller's New York Rangers teammate Vincent Trocheck.\n\n\"We have a really good group of young, hungry Americans that haven't played in the Olympics before,\" Hughes said. \"Guys are pumped up and we should be really excited.\"\n\nBuffalo's Tage Thompson, Utah's Clayton Keller and Florida defenseman Seth Jones were not on the US Four Nations squad but did make the US Olympic lineup, as did Vancouver defenseman Quinn Hughes, who was hurt during last year's event.\n\nAmerican defensemen heading to Italy also include Noah Hanifan of Vegas, Boston's Charlie McAvoy, Minnesota's Brock Faber, Ottawa's Jake Sanderson, Carolina's Jaccob Slavin and Zach Werenski of Columbus.\n\nAll three goaltenders from the Four Nations Face-Off -- Winnipeg's Connor Hellebuyck, Boston's Jeremy Swayman and Jake Oettinger of Dallas -- will return for the US quest for its first gold medal since the 1980 Lake Placid Olympic \"Miracle on Ice.\"\n\nSanderson and Faber competed for the US squad in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and are the only US players with Games experience as active NHL talent returns to the Olympics for the first time since 2014.\n\n\"We're excited about our team,\" US Olympic men's general manager Bill Guerin said. \"It was incredibly difficult for our management group to get to the final roster.\"\n\nThe Americans will open Olympic competition on February 12 against Latvia.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te on Thursday vowed to defend the self-ruled island’s sovereignty in the face of China’s “expansionist ambitions,” days after Beijing wrapped up live-fire military drills near its shores.\n\n“In the face of China’s rising expansionist ambitions, the international community is watching to see whether the Taiwanese people have the resolve to defend themselves,” Lai said in his New Year’s address.\n\n“As president, my stance has always been clear: to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, strengthen national defense and the resilience of the whole society, and comprehensively construct an effective deterrence and democratic defense mechanism,” he added.\n\nLai’s comments came days after China wrapped up live-fire drills around Taiwan featuring rocket launches, aircraft and warships. Beijing had expressed anger at a planned U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, as well as at Japan’s new leader’s comments that Tokyo could intervene in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\n\nChina sees Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to annex it by force if necessary. A former Japanese colony, Taiwan has been governed independently from the mainland since 1949, when the Nationalist Party lost a civil war against the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to the island.\n\nLai's speech was met angrily in Beijing, where a spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office called the president “a saboteur of peace, a troublemaker and a warmonger,” according to the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n“No matter what Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party authorities say or do, they cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China,\" said spokesperson Chen Binhua.\n\nThe planned arms sale, valued at more than $11 billion, is the U.S.’s largest so far to Taiwan. It includes missiles, drones, artillery systems and military software.\n\nThe United States is obligated by its own laws to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\n\nChina’s leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan’s eventual annexation “ unstoppable \" during his own televised New Year’s address on Wednesday.\n\nTaiwan last year announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called the Taiwan Dome.\n\nThe budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Lai already pledged to raise defense spending to 5% of the island’s GDP, as part of his strategy amid China’s threats of invasion.\n\n“Facing China’s serious military ambitions, Taiwan has no time to wait,” Lai said.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain.\n\nThe rule is not publicly documented, but chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand their plants have been told ​by authorities in recent months that they must prove through procurement tenders that at least half their equipment will be Chinese-made, the people told Reuters.\n\nThe mandate is one of the most ‌significant measures Beijing has introduced to wean itself off reliance on foreign technology, a push that gathered pace after the U.S. tightened technology export restrictions in 2023, banning sales of advanced AI chips and semiconductor equipment to China.\n\nWhile those U.S. export restrictions blocked ‌the sale of some of the most advanced tools, the 50% rule is leading Chinese manufacturers to choose domestic suppliers even in areas where foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Europe remain available.\n\nApplications failing the threshold are typically rejected, though authorities grant flexibility depending on supply constraints, the people said. The requirements are relaxed for advanced chip production lines, where domestically developed equipment is not yet fully available.\n\n\"Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%,\" one source told Reuters. \"Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment.\"\n\nChina's industry ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The sources did not wish ⁠to be identified as the measure is not public.\n\nChina's President ‌Xi Jinping has been calling for a \"whole nation\" effort to build a fully self-sufficient domestic semiconductor supply chain that involves thousands of engineers and scientists at companies and research centers nationwide.\n\nThe effort is being made across the wide supply-chain spectrum.

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and missile units to conduct joint live-fire drills around the island of Taiwan, which Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace.”\n\nTaiwan’s aviation authority said more than 100,000 international air travelers would be affected by flight cancellations or diversions.\n\nThe drills came after Beijing expressed anger at what could be the largest-ever U.S. arms sale to the self-ruled territory, and at a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, saying its military could get involved if China takes action against Taiwan. China says Taiwan must come under its rule.\n\nChina's military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday, but Beijing's foreign ministry accused Taiwan's ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support.\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry said rapid response exercises were underway, with forces on high alert. “The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” it said.\n\nBeijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a near-daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of the exercises.\n\nSenior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.\n\nShi said activities would focus on sea-air combat readiness patrol, “joint seizure of comprehensive superiority” and blockades on key ports. It was the first large-scale military drill where the command publicly mentioned one goal was “all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\n“It is a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity,” Shi said.\n\nChina and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when a civil war brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing. Defeated Nationalist Party forces fled to Taiwan. The island has operated since then with its own government, though the mainland’s government claims it as sovereign territory.\n\nDrills will continue on Tuesday\n\nChina's command on Monday deployed destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles, alongside long-range rockets, to the north and southwest of the Taiwan Strait. It carried out live-fire exercises against targets in the waters. Among other training, drills to test the capabilities of sea-air coordination and precise target hunting were conducted in the waters and airspace to the east of the strait.\n\nHsieh Jih-sheng, deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence of the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, said that as of 3 p.m. Monday, 89 aircraft and drones were operating around the strait, with 67 of them entering the “response zone\" — airspace under the force's monitoring and response. The ministry detected 14 navy ships around the strait and four other warships in the Western Pacific, in addition to 14 coast guard vessels.\n\n“Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait ... does not only mean military pressure on us. It may bring more complex impact and challenges to the international community and neighboring countries,” Hsieh told reporters.\n\nMilitary drills are set to continue Tuesday. Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration said Chinese authorities had issued a notice saying seven temporary dangerous zones would be set up around the strait to carry out rocket-firing exercises from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., barring aircraft from entering them.\n\nThe Taiwanese aviation authority said more than 850 international flights were initially scheduled during that period and the drills would affect over 100,000 travelers. Over 80 domestic flights, involving around 6,000 passengers, were also canceled, it added.\n\nCommercial airlines began to announce dozens of cancellations and delays for domestic routes across Taiwan, particularly ones along islands near China.\n\nThe Chinese command released themed posters about the drills online accompanied by provocative wording. One depicted two shields with the Great Wall alongside three military aircraft and two ships. Its social media post said the drills were about the “Shield of Justice, Smashing Illusion,\" adding that any foreign interlopers or separatists touching the shields would be eliminated.\n\nLast week, Beijing imposed sanctions against 20 U.S. defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington announced large-scale arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion. It still requires approval by the U.S. Congress.\n\nUnder U.S. federal law in place for many years, Washington is obligated to assist Taipei with its defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. The U.S. and Taiwan had formal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter’s administration recognized and established relations with Beijing.\n\nAsked about the drills, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party has attempted \"to seek independence by soliciting U.S. support and even risk turning Taiwan into a powder keg and ammunition depot.”\n\n“External forces’ attempts to use Taiwan to contain China and to arm Taiwan will only embolden the Taiwan independence forces and push the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war,” he said.\n\nThere was no immediate U.S. statement on the drills.\n\nKaren Kuo, spokesperson for the Taiwanese president's office, said the drills were undermining the stability and security of the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region and openly challenging international law and order.\n\n“Our country strongly condemns the Chinese authorities for disregarding international norms and using military intimidation to threaten neighboring countries.” she said.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry released a video that featured its weapons and forces in a show of resilience. Multiple French Mirage-2000 aircraft conducted landings at an air force base.\n\nIn October, the Taiwanese government said it would accelerate the building of a “Taiwan Shield” or “T-Dome” air defense system in the face of the military threat from China.\n\nThe military tensions came a day after Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he hoped the Taiwan Strait would be associated with peace and prosperity, instead of “crashing waves and howling winds,\" during a trip to Shanghai.",

Credit - Adek Berry—AFP/Getty Images\n\nChina launched extensive military drills near Taiwan on Monday in what it called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces after the Trump Administration announced an $11.1 billion arms sale to the island earlier this month.\n\nThe Chinese military’s “Justice Mission 2025” exercises—the first major drills it has held around the island since April—are to include combat-readiness and port-blockade drills, complete with live fire and simulated land and sea strikes, along seven zones across the island, in part to deter outside intervention, China’s Eastern Theater Command announced.\n\nTaiwan has been self-governed since 1949, after Nationalist forces fled to the island following their defeat by Chinese Communist powers. But China has maintained that it has sovereignty over Taiwan and long called for a “reunification” between the smaller territory and the People’s Republic of China.\n\nSenior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of the Eastern Theater Command, said the drills were a “stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces” and described the military action as a “necessary” move to protect China’s \"sovereignty and national unity.”\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said the exercises “further confirm” the Chinese Communist Party’s “nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace.”\n\nIn the drills, China is operating dozens of aircraft and drones around the Taiwan Strait, according to the deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence for the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, Hsieh Jih-sheng. More than 100,000 travelers on international flights were set to be affected by the Chinese military’s actions, per the island’s Transport Ministry.\n\nMilitary drills are expected to continue through Tuesday, Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration said.\n\nThe exercises come as China has expressed ire over the recent $11.1 billion U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, which includes high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and harpoon missile repair related equipment. The U.S. previously approved more than $1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan in November.\n\nLast week, the Chinese foreign ministry enacted sanctions against 20 U.S. defense firms in the wake of the sales, barring companies such as Boeing from doing business with the global superpower. Ten executives for those companies were also barred from entering China or doing business in the country under the sanctions.\n\nThe State Department notified Congress that it had approved the large-scale sale to Taiwan less than two weeks ago, saying that the potential deal “serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"\n\n“The proposed sale[s] will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region,” the department’s statement continued.\n\nTaiwan’s presidential office stated at the time that it was “sincerely grateful” for the announced sale, while China quickly condemned it, asserting that it undermined Chinese sovereignty and security and disrupted peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",

    "fullText": "HUZHOU, Dec 29 (Reuters) - China's rocket startup LandSpace has made no secret about drawing inspiration from Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nEarlier this month, the Beijing-based firm became the first Chinese entity to conduct a reusable rocket test. That put SpaceX on alert and LandSpace is now preparing to go public ​to fund its future projects, just as its bigger and far more successful U.S. rival considers an initial public offering of its own.\n\nEven though LandSpace's ‌Zhuque-3 rocket test ended in failure, its aspiration to become second only to SpaceX in reusable rockets is providing a fresh impetus to China's space industry, which has long been dominated by risk-averse, state-owned entities.\n\n\"(SpaceX) ‌can push products to the edge and even into failure, quickly identifying limits and iterating,\" Zhuque-3 chief designer Dai Zheng told state broadcaster CCTV after the rocket's inaugural flight.\n\nDai said his decision in 2016 to join LandSpace and leave the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, the country's main state-owned rocket developer, was partly motivated by SpaceX's focus on reusability and his desire to create a Chinese equivalent.\n\nLandSpace's focus on giving China its own low-cost launch option similar to SpaceX's flight-proven reusable rocket Falcon 9 will play a key role ⁠in Beijing's plans to build up 10,000 satellite constellations in ‌the coming decades.\n\n\"Falcon 9 is a successful configuration that has been tested by engineering,\" Zhuque-3's deputy chief designer Dong Kai said in a podcast interview last week. \"After studying it, we recognize its rationality; this is learning, not imitation.\"\n\n\"Calling (Zhuque-3) a 'Chinese Falcon 9,' I think, is a ‍very high compliment.\"\n\nIts startup culture and mimicking of SpaceX has already initiated a paradigm shift in China's space industry.\n\nChina's state-led space programme has historically been allergic to failed launches, in contrast to SpaceX and other Western firms that regularly broadcast their mishaps.\n\nBut earlier this month, state media covered China's first two failed attempts at recovering a reusable rocket, with the second launch ​coming from a state-owned firm, just three weeks after Zhuque-3's maiden flight.\n\nLandSpace also opened its engine factory floor to Reuters this month, allowing foreign media to take ‌a peek at one of its core assets for the first time.\n\nAfter opening up the space sector to private money in 2014, which spawned several startups including LandSpace, Beijing is now looking to help leading domestic players tap into capital markets by making it easier for them to pursue IPOs.",

It was FAST & DECISIVE, as all of these situations should be!” Trump wrote.\n\nThe talks in China aim to ensure a sustained ceasefire and promote lasting peace between the countries, according to a statement by Sihasak’s office.\n\nWang was scheduled to join both bilateral meetings with each of the diplomats and a trilateral talk on Monday.\n\nChina has welcomed the ceasefire announcement, which freezes the front lines and allows for displaced civilians to return to their homes near the border.\n\n“China stands ready to continue to provide (the) platform and create conditions for Cambodia and Thailand to have fuller and more detailed communication,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement read.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement comes with a 72-hour observation period, at the end of which Thailand agreed to repatriate 18 Cambodian soldiers it has held as prisoners since earlier fighting in July. Their release has been a major demand of the Cambodian side.\n\nPrak Sokhonn, in a statement after his meeting with Wang, expressed deep appreciation for China’s “vital role” in supporting the ceasefire.\n\nChina also announced 20 million yuan ($2.8 million) of emergency humanitarian aid for Cambodia to assist the displaced.\n\nThe first batch of Chinese aid, including food, tents and blankets, arrived in Cambodia on Sunday, Wang Wenbin, Chinese ambassador to Cambodia, wrote on Facebook.\n\nSihasak said Sunday he hoped the meetings would convey to China that it should both support a sustainable ceasefire and send a signal to Cambodia against reviving the conflict or attempting to create further ones.\n\n“Thailand does not see China merely as a mediator in our conflict with Cambodia but wants China to play a constructive role in ensuring a sustainable ceasefire by sending such signals to Cambodia as well,” he said.",

But it has said the capital-intensive nature of rocket development means it ⁠will need access to China's capital markets if it hopes ​to compete with SpaceX.\n\nThe Shanghai exchange's rules do not state ​that rocket firms must successfully recover a rocket, only that reusable rocket technology be used to put a satellite into orbit, something LandSpace already achieved with this month's launch.\n\nCompanies ‍that undertake national missions ⁠or participate in major state-led space projects will receive priority support, according to the new guidelines, which take effect immediately, underscoring the close alignment between commercial launch activity and China's broader strategic ⁠goals.\n\nChina has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on low-Earth orbit satellites as a national security risk and is actively pushing its own ‌satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the ‌next decades.",

    "fullText": "SHANGHAI - Japanese-themed manga and anime have been barred from one of China's largest comic conventions about a week before the show begins in late December, Hong Kong media reported, amid a continuing diplomatic row between Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nThe decision was notified to participants last Friday ahead of the two-day Comicup convention scheduled to be held next weekend in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou near Shanghai, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nExhibitors and visitors were informed by the event's organizers that there would be a \"full-scale adjustment\" of content toward \"a new Chinese style\" theme across the venue due to the \"current social environment and our cultural obligations,\" the Hong Kong newspaper said Tuesday.\n\nThe exhibition areas themed around American and European content did not seem to be affected at the event featuring some 7,000 booths, which has become a massive marketplace for creators of derivative works based on various anime, comics, and game fan groups, according to the report.\n\nWhile the notification did not name Japan, several dozen exhibitors featuring Japanese anime and other themed content said on social media that their booths had been cancelled for reasons \"well-known to all\" and \"factors beyond control,\" the SCMP said.\n\nA similar comic convention held in Shanghai in October drew hundreds of thousands of visitors. The paper quoted a woman whose booth was supposed to have featured artwork of the Japanese manga \"Let's Go Karaoke!\" as saying, \"I am feeling utterly helpless and sad.\"\n\nThe ongoing dispute between the two Asian neighbors stems from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's parliamentary remarks last month that suggested an attack on Taiwan could constitute a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Japan, prompting possible involvement of the Self-Defense Forces.\n\nBeijing has since ramped up its retaliatory measures, including urging its citizens not to visit Japan, suspending seafood imports from the neighboring country and canceling cultural events featuring Japanese artists.\n\nMeanwhile, manga and animation events scheduled for January in such Chinese cities as Shenzhen in Guangdong Province and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province were postponed due to \"force majeure,\" according to organizers.",

Foreign individuals, organisations and entities will also come under its jurisdiction if their Antarctic expeditions are organised within or launched from Chinese territory.\n\nTo get permission for activities such as expeditions, tourism and shipping in Antarctica, applicants will have to submit detailed plans, environmental impact assessment documents, emergency response plans and proof of insurance or financial guarantees to cover potential liabilities, according to the report.\n\nAny unauthorised activities, violation of authorisation terms, or breaches of management regulations and environmental protection duties could result in penalties.\n\nThe draft law also encourages activities to be carried out \"in an environmentally friendly and low-carbon manner\".\n\nIt sets out specific requirements for the protection of Antarctic flora and fauna, waste management and disposal, prevention of marine pollution, as well as area protection and the preservation of historic sites and monuments.\n\nThe draft also includes provisions for responding to sudden environmental incidents, according to Xinhua.\n\nChina has established five scientific stations in Antarctica.

Five Chinese scientific stations have been established in Antarctica so far. China also became a signatory to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty in 1991.\n\nThe government formally established an administrative permission system for Antarctic expeditions in 2004 and standardised the application and management process within the State Oceanic Administration in 2014.\n\nBut there has been a legal gap when it comes to regulating non-official activities in Antarctica such as private expeditions, commercial tourism, fishing and shipping.\n\nThe legislation also comes amid a surge in Chinese tourism to Antarctica. China has become the second-largest source of Antarctic tourists after the United States.\n\nThe number of Chinese visitors to the continent peaked in 2018 at 8,273, accounting for 16 per cent of the global total, according to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, which promotes responsible travel to the continent.\n\nThe State Oceanic Administration issued guidelines on Antarctic tourism in 2018, prohibiting acts that cause harm to the fragile polar ecology. Those who violate the guidelines will be blacklisted and restricted from entering Antarctica for one to three years.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China will impose up to 42.7% of provisional tariffs on dairy products including milk and cheese imported from the European Union, its Commerce Ministry said Monday.\n\nThe elevated duties, which take effect Tuesday, were based on preliminary results from an investigation opened by China’s Commerce Ministry in August 2024 as tensions between Beijing and Brussels flared. Beijing reviewed subsidies provided by EU countries for their dairy and other farm products.\n\nBeijing’s probe was launched as part of tit-for-tat measures as the EU investigated Chinese subsidies on electric vehicles, and later imposed tariffs as high as 45.3% on China-made EVs.\n\nChina had initiated other probes into European brandy and pork imports as counter measures for the EU’s tariffs on Chinese EVs. It had also urged the EU to scrap its EV tariffs.\n\nThe temporary duties on EU dairy imports will range from 21.9% to 42.7%, according to the Commerce Ministry, and will cover a basket of dairy products, including fresh and processed cheese, blue cheese, milk, and cream with a fat content exceeding 10% by weight.\n\nThe ministry said preliminary findings from its investigation determined that subsidies provided by the EU and EU member states for their dairy products had damaged China’s dairy industry.\n\nThe European Commission, which manages trade talks and issues on behalf of the 27 EU member countries, expressed concern over the tariffs.\n\n“The commission’s assessment is that the investigation is based on questionable allegations and insufficient evidence, and that the measures are therefore unjustified and unwarranted,” spokesperson Olof Gill said.\n\nGill told reporters that the commission is examining the reasoning behind the move and intends to provide comments to the Chinese authorities.\n\nBeijing’s probe into EU dairy products covered subsidies given under the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy and subsidies offered to farmers by EU countries including Italy, Ireland and Finland, the Commerce Ministry said in August 2024.\n\nChina’s relationship with the EU is fractious, with the Chinese trade surplus with the EU recently coming into the spotlight. The EU runs a significant trade deficit with China, at more than 300 billion euros ($352 billion) last year.\n\nLast week, Beijing announced it was imposing up to 19.8% tariffs on EU pork imports — significantly lower than preliminary tariffs of up to 62.4%.\n\nIt accused the EU of dumping pork and pig by-products in the country, selling them at cheap prices which in turn harmed its domestic pork industry.\n\nIn July, Beijing also announced up to 34.9% tariffs on brandy imported from the EU — including cognac from France — although several major brandy brands had received exemptions.\n\nGill said the EU remains committed to good trade and investment ties with China.\n\n“But in order for that to meaningfully happen, there is a list of issues and concerns that the European Union has had going back many months and even years that we would require China to address, in terms of overcapacity, in terms of unfair use of trade instruments, in terms of trade deficit, and so on,” he said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, a move that is sure to infuriate China.\n\nThe State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Donald Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all. U.S.-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump’s second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China’s increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must reunify with the mainland.\n\nThe eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS — similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia — worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.\n\nOther sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.\n\nIn separate but nearly identical statements, the State Department said the sales serve “U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.”\n\n“The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,” the statements said.\n\nUnder federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain “sufficient self-defense capabilities” and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense “is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,” the ministry said.\n\nTaiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its “long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities,” which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.\n\nThe arms sales comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.\n\nTaiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.\n\nThe U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Trump is expected to sign shortly.\n\nLast week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor.\n\n“The bill has kept playing up the ‘China threat’ narrative, trumpeting for military support to Taiwan, abusing state power to go after Chinese economic development, limiting trade, economic and people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.S., undermining China’s sovereignty, security and development interests and disrupting efforts of the two sides in stabilizing bilateral relations,” Beijing’s embassy in Washington said after the legislation passed the House.\n\n“China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this,” it said.\n\nThe U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing. AP video journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "SHANGHAI, Dec 17 (Reuters) - MetaX Integrated Circuits jumped 700% in its Shanghai market debut as the Chinese AI chipmaker tapped into strong momentum triggered by Beijing's push to reduce reliance on chips from U.S. firms Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nFounded by former AMD executives, MetaX raised roughly $600 million in an initial public ​offering last week, days after larger rival Moore Threads debuted with a 400% pop.\n\nMetaX opened at 700 yuan a share in Shanghai versus an IPO price of ‌104.66 yuan, before surging as high as 895 yuan, defying persistent AI bubble concerns in other markets. The stock ended the trading session at 829.9 yuan, up 693%.\n\n\"It's another IPO tale in China that turns a crow into ‌a phoenix,\" said fund manager Yang Tingwu at Tongheng Investment.\n\nThe price surge \"creates huge arbitrage opportunities\" for pre-IPO investors, Yang said, and \"we're likely witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years\".\n\nMakers of artificial intelligence (AI) chips are rushing to sell shares in China to capitalise on interest generated by a government drive to boost local production in competition with the U.S.\n\n\"AI and semiconductors are key areas of competition in the Sino-U.S. tech rivalry,\" Guotai Haitong Securities said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing. \"Against the backdrop of geopolitical tension, AI chipmaking has huge growth potential,\" as China seeks to achieve self-sufficiency.\n\nResearcher ⁠Frost & Sullivan forecast China AI chip sales to top $189 billion ‌by 2029 versus $54 billion in 2026.\n\nMetaX, which makes graphics processing units (GPUs), raised 4.2 billion yuan ($596 million) last week in a share sale that was more than 4,000 times oversubscribed by retail investors.\n\nThe IPO - China's sixth biggest so far this year, according to KPMG - priced the money-losing ‍startup at 50 times its 2024 sales. That compared with a multiple of 34 for Nvidia and 14 for AMD, MetaX said in a pre-listing statement.\n\nMetaX's debut catapulted the value of the five-year-old startup to more than 300 billion yuan ($42.58 billion) and boosted the wealth of founder and major shareholder Chen Weiliang, 49.\n\nAfter working for AMD Shanghai for 13 years, Chen founded MetaX with a mission to \"contribute to China's rejuvenation ​and national prosperity.\" The founding team also included Peng Li and Yang Jian, both former AMD engineers.\n\n\"The company is a leading GPU maker in China thanks to its AMD gene,\" ‌Li Hui, analyst at Huajin Securities, said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Thousands of people flocked to Tokyo's Ueno zoo to have a last glimpse of the popular twin pandas that are set to return to China next month, worried if or when they get to see their replacement in Japan as Tokyo's relations with Beijing sunk.\n\nThe Tokyo metropolitan government announced Monday that Xiao Xiao and his sister Lei Lei will return to China in late January and that their last day of public viewing will be Jan. 25.\n\nTheir departure will leave Japan without a panda for the first time in more than half a century. Prospects for their replacement are not favorable as ties between the two countries have plunged in recent weeks.\n\nGiant pandas are native to southwestern China and serve as an unofficial national mascot. Beijing lends them to other countries as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over them and any cubs they produce.\n\nYuki Imai, a panda fan visiting from the neighboring Kanagawa prefecture, said she was shocked by the news of the twins' return and decided to visit. “I thought I should come and see them soon while I still can.”\n\nMany queued for more than two hours to get to see the twins for one minute. Kazuhiro Yamamoto said he came to see the pandas with his wife Hiroko “for the one last time,” and that the twins may be returning sooner due to the rocky relations.\n\nThe four-year-old twins were born at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens in June, 2021, and raised there, but they remain on loan from China and must be returned by February.\n\nRelations between Japan and China have worsened since Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in early November that its military could get involved if China were to impose a naval blockade or other action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nChina has since restricted tourism to Japan, and cultural events and exchanges between local governments have been canceled.\n\nThe row escalated this month when Chinese drills involving an aircraft carrier near southern Japan prompted Tokyo to scramble fighter jets. Japan also protested that its aircraft were targeted by repeated radar-locking — a move considered as possible preparation for missile firing.\n\nTadashi Nakatani, a 51-year-old calligrapher at a temple who regularly visits from his hometown of Kamakura, west of Tokyo, said international relations may affect the panda diplomacy, but he has hope.\n\n“When things calm down and the relationship becomes stable, I sincerely hope that pandas will come again, and that a day will come when everyone can enjoy seeing them again.”\n\nChina sent the first pair of pandas to Japan in 1972 to mark the normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Since then, Japan has never been left without a panda.\n\nThousands of visitors formed a long line outside the zoo Tuesday morning. During their one-minute viewing time at the panda zone, visitors called out the twins’ names and took photos or videos as the pair nibbled bamboo sticks or strolled around.\n\nBeginning next week, only up to 4,800 visitors who successfully booked their 1-minute slot online will be able to see the beloved twins, according to the zoo.\n\nJapan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said Monday that pandas have long been loved by Japanese people and he hoped the friendship through panda diplomacy between the two countries will continue.\n\n“Exchanges through pandas have contributed to improve the public sentiment between Japan and China, and we hope the relationship will continue,” Kihara said. He noted that a number of local municipalities and zoos have expressed hope that new pandas will be loaned out soon.\n\nUeno Zoological Gardens curator Hitoshi Suzuki, referring to the panda twins, said raising them in good health was challenging. “But they gave us many kinds of joy and surprise. They also brought great delight to our visitors. We have nothing but words of gratitude.”\n\nThe zoo plans to promote other animals to make up for the absence of the pandas, while waiting for their replacement. “We will keep the panda area for the time being, so that we can accommodate possible new arrivals at any time.”",
