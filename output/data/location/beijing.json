    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Chinese rare earth producer Ningbo Jintian Copper (601609.SS) said on Wednesday ​it had secured streamlined licences for ‌magnet product exports.\n\nThe new \"general licences\" are designed to allow more ‌exports under year-long permits for individual customers following an agreement after a meeting between China's President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart Donald ⁠Trump in late ‌October.\n\nNingbo Jintian Copper's rare earth magnet products are used in electric vehicles, ‍wind turbines, robots, consumer electronics and medical equipment, it said on an investor interactive platform.\n\nBeijing added several rare earth ⁠elements and magnets to ​its export control list in ​early April, requiring a dual-use licence for exports. China's exports of rare earth ‍magnets slumped ⁠in April and May, forcing some global automakers to shutter parts of production.\n\nThe new ⁠streamlined licence will not replace the existing dual-use licensing ‌regime.",
