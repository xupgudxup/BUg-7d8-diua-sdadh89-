    "fullText": "Real Madrid’s problems have been compounded further as the club have been dealt yet another injury blow.\n\nJust a day after succumbing to a 2-1 loss at the hands of CA Osauna, the club have now confirmed the injury of Dani Ceballos.\n\nThe Spanish midfielder had a horror night against Osasuna, making two notable errors, one of which led to Osasuna’s winning goal. The player later apologised to the fans for his mistakes, taking ownership of his actions.\n\nIn an official statement, Real Madrid have confirmed Ceballos has been diagnosed with a muscle tear in the soleus muscle in his right leg.\n\nAccording to COPE, Ceballos’ fresh injury could rule him out of action for at least seven weeks. This means he will miss most of the key matches that will define Real Madrid’s season.\n\nReal Madrid will be ruled out for at least seven weeks due to injury. (Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)\n\nAlthough the Spaniard wasn’t a key component in Alvaro Arbeloa’s plans, his injury will put pressure on the team by restricting the coach’s rotational options.\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, this will mark the end of Ceballos’ stint at Real Madrid, with recent reports suggesting that the club are more than keen on offloading the player in the summer.\n\nClub president Florentino Perez is not happy with Ceballos at all and it appears Real Madrid are ready to sanction his sale for just €10 million at the end of the season.\n\nIf there was a chance of a late revival, those chances disappeared after his poor showing against Osasuna. And now, with the injury, the Spaniard will no longer be able to prove himself at the Bernabeu.",

    "description": "From Ohio to Georgia to California, here are the billionaires who are running for their state's top office.",
    "fullText": "Your state's next governor might be a billionaire.\n\nBillionaires in both political parties are throwing their hats in the ring to be the next governor in three different states across the US, and some of them are spending their own fortunes to do so.\n\nDemocratic Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois is the sole billionaire serving as governor of a US state right now. But it's not that uncommon for billionaires to run for, and even win, their state's top office.\n\nBefore becoming Secretary of the Interior under President Donald Trump, billionaire Doug Burgum served for eight years as the governor of North Dakota. And before he was elected to the Senate in 2024, Republican coal magnate Jim Justice served as West Virginia's governor.\n\nPoliticians in America tend to be wealthy, and running for office is expensive. Billionaires and multi-millionaires often spend their own money to fund their campaigns, and sometimes they're recruited by party leaders specifically for that reason.\n\nHere's what to know about the billionaires running for governor in 2026.\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer is a leading Democratic contender for governor of California in 2026.\n\nSteyer, a philanthropist and climate activist who also ran for president in 2020, made his fortune running the hedge fund Farallon Capital.\n\nHe is estimated to be worth $2 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHis gubernatorial campaign is almost entirely self-funded. He has poured at least $38 million of his own wealth into his campaign so far, according to recent disclosures.\n\nRecent polling has generally put Steyer in fifth place, landing behind GOP candidates Steve Hilton and Sheriff Chad Bianco, along with Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell and former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter.\n\nBillionaire Vivek Ramaswamy is the overwhelming favorite to be the GOP nominee for governor of Ohio in 2026.\n\nRamaswamy got rich in the biotech industry, and Forbes estimates his net worth to be $2.2 billion.\n\nHe rose to political prominence during the 2024 GOP presidential primary, when he poured over $30 million into his largely self-funded, long-shot campaign. He was later slated to be the co-head of DOGE, but ultimately left to launch his gubernatorial bid.\n\nUnlike his presidential bid, Ramaswamy is not self-funding this time, and he raised nearly $20 million in 2025 without contributing his own funds.\n\nHe is expected to face Democratic candidate Amy Acton, the former director of the state's Department of Health, in the November election.\n\nBillionaire Rick Jackson, the founder and CEO of Jackson Healthcare, is a leading contender for the GOP nomination in Georgia's 2026 gubernatorial election.\n\nHe entered the race in has pledged to spend $50 million on his campaign, a sum that's sure to shake up an already crowded field.\n\nOther major contenders in the GOP primary include Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger, Lieutenant Gov. Burt Jones, and state Attorney General Chris Carr. Trump has endorsed Jones.",

    "title": "California tried to protect students' data. Tech companies found loopholes",
    "description": "A legislative battle is under way over gaps that allow companies to collect and sell students’ personal information.",
    "fullText": "The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, uses investigative reporting, data analysis, and software engineering to challenge technology to serve the public good. \n\nFor every aspect of a student’s life, there’s a tech company trying to digitize it. Inside the classroom, online tools proctor exams, create flashcards and submit assignments. Outside, technology coordinates school sports, helps bus drivers find the right route and maintains students’ health records.\n\nCalifornia has a number of laws aimed at protecting children’s data privacy, but those laws have exceptions that allow many tech companies to continue packaging and selling students’ personal information.\n\nThis year, Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a San Luis Obispo Democrat, is carrying a high-profile state bill that would add new protections for students. She says it’s important, especially as the Trump admin is trying to collect data about California residents’ immigration status, gender identity, and their use of certain public benefits.\n\nHistorically, California has been a leader in data privacy. In 2014, California passed a landmark student privacy law that prohibited technology companies from selling students’ data, targeting students in advertising, or disclosing their personal information. Then in 2018, the state passed another unprecedented bill that required all companies give California users certain privacy rights, such as a chance to opt out of data collection and delete some of their information.\n\nBut as technology evolved and proliferated, privacy laws repeatedly fell short in protecting California’s students — at the same time that the federal government has tried to collect increasing amounts of personal information, Addis said.\n\nHer bill would restrict how AI companies use student data and create new data protections for college students. Some of Sacramento’s most powerful players are paying close attention to the measure, including the California Labor Federation, which supports the bill, and the California Chamber of Commerce, which opposes it. Combined, these two groups spent nearly $8 million on campaign donations to state legislators or other political activities in 2024, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database. TechNet, a trade association that represents many of the most powerful tech companies, also opposes the bill.\n\nThe proposal, Assembly Bill 1159, would close certain loopholes in the state’s 2014 education privacy law, but experts say it may not be enough to prevent companies from selling students’ data.\n\nJen King is a privacy and data policy fellow at Stanford’s institute for AI, where she studies the tricks that companies use to gather users’ data and prevent them from opting out, sometimes known as “dark patterns.” In her personal life, she’s vigilant about avoiding online data tracking and maintains a landline in her Bay Area home to avoid giving out her cell phone number.\n\nKing doesn’t want her children’s information available online or for any company to sell, though sometimes it happens before she can stop it.\n\nIn the fall, King got an email about a platform called TeamSnap, which her 12-year-old son’s cross country coaches were using to manage the team’s roster. The company wanted her information, including her name, date of birth, gender, email address, and phone number. Once she logged in to the platform, she could see some of her son’s information, such as his name, email, and date of birth, were already listed. Photos and personal information from all of her son’s teammates were also available for her to see.\n\n“I was super irritated,” she said. “You don’t need my birth date — I’m a freaking parent.” She acknowledged some personal information could be useful for a coach but said that other questions seem designed to help the platform sell information to data brokers and ultimately, to advertisers.\n\nHer 17-year-old son’s data is also on TeamSnap, she later learned, because his robotics team uses it. This month, when King tried to show The Markup and CalMatters her TeamSnap account, a pop-up appeared, asking her if the company could track her activity across other apps and websites.\n\nFederal law requires companies to get parental consent before knowingly collecting or selling data from children 12 and under, but once a child turns 13, their data is generally treated much like an adult’s information, especially when that child is interacting with tech platforms outside of school. TeamSnap’s privacy policy says it doesn’t knowingly collect personal information about users under 13 “without express parental consent,” though it says in some cases a team or organization may provide information on behalf of the child.\n\nThe policy also says that TeamSnap has “not sold the personal information of any consumer for monetary consideration” in the last 12 months, but that its “use of cookies and other tracking technologies may be considered a sale of personal information under the CCPA (California privacy law).” Information sold to advertisers and marketers included users’ names, contact information, purchase history and geolocation, the policy says.\n\nCalifornia privacy law specifically requires certain large for-profit companies to get consent to collect data from anyone under 16. Often, consent happens when a user first opens a website and a pop-up appears, asking if the website can sell your data or track your cookies.\n\nIf a teacher, coach, or other authority figure tells a student that they have to use a website or an app, then the student cannot realistically opt out, King said. They may be too young to understand how to opt out, she added. “Most 15-, 16-year-olds don’t have any idea what this is about.”\n\nEven older college students may have little agency in the technology they use, especially if it’s required for class or residential life. At Stanford, for example, King said her undergraduate students are often required to create Facebook accounts for student groups.\n\nThe same is true for parents. King said she reluctantly gave TeamSnap her personal information, including her name, email, date of birth, and the landline number for her home, because it was the only way to get updates about her son’s team.\n\nIn 2014, California became the first state in the country to regulate education technology companies directly, but being first comes with its drawbacks. “We didn’t have examples of what best practice was,” said Amelia Vance, the president of the Public Interest Privacy Center, a nonprofit organization. The law only applies to products that “primarily” serve K-12 schools and that are designed and marketed for students.\n\nMany tech companies argue that their products aren’t primarily intended for students or at least that they were not designed or marketed that way. The language-learning app DuoLingo, for example, has a version for schools, but the app is also popular for adults. Apps or technologies serving extracurricular programs or sports teams can claim they weren’t designed and marketed for the classroom, or that their use isn’t mandatory, said Vance. “You have this sort of black hole where there haven’t been protections.”\n\nAddis’ bill expands the number of education technology companies that fall under the state’s student privacy laws, but the language is murky when it comes to apps or online services used outside of class.\n\nIn the case of TeamSnap, Addis’ communications director Alexis Garcia-Arrazola said the company would “most likely” fall under the scope of the bill if its technology is marketed to schools, if schools direct students to use it, and if the sports team is sponsored by the school.\n\nPublic records show that Piedmont Unified School District in Alameda County, Tamalpais Union High School District in Marin County, and Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District all purchased versions of TeamSnap, but only the Santa Monica Malibu district responded to questions about any privacy restriction imposed on the company. Brandyi Phillips, the chief communications officer for the Santa Monica Malibu schools, said the district has an annual subscription with TeamSnap, which is only available to sports staff and parents. She said there’s an agreement with the company “to protect District information and to prevent unauthorized access” but did not clarify if that agreement prevents the district from selling students’ information.\n\nBerkeley Unified School District, where King’s children attend school, did not respond to questions about any contracts, purchase orders or agreements with TeamSnap.\n\nLocally, school districts and colleges have the power to negotiate the privacy terms of any contract they make with a technology company, but many websites and apps offer free versions that a teacher or coach might recommend without getting formal approval from their district.\n\nLast year, the California State University system signed a nearly $17 million contract with Open AI, the company that operates ChatGPT, including an agreement that the company will not train its models on student data. Advocates for Addis’ bill say the same privacy restrictions should apply to any AI company with access to California student data, regardless of whether the company has an agreement with the student’s school district or college.\n\nAddis’ bill comes as privacy laws in California and across the country are in flux. In 2020, California voters approved a proposition to create a new state agency to enforce data privacy rules and regulate the businesses that collect data. Advocates for the proposition contributed over $6.7 million to the campaign, compared to just over $50,000 contributed by the opposition, according to state data. The state agency that the proposition formed, now known as CalPrivacy, released new rules this year, restricting the use of automated decision-making technology, such as the use of AI to make admissions or hiring decisions. Those rules were originally stricter but businesses, lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom pressured the CalPrivacy board to water them down.\n\nIn Washington D.C., Congress is considering changing federal law to limit how companies interact with children under 17. Separately, Congress is considering a bill that would require social media companies to prevent and mitigate children’s sexual exploitation, bullying, and self-harm. California Attorney General Rob Bonta is concerned that one version of the social media bill contains language that could erode existing protections in California law.\n\nBonta’s office is responsible for enforcing many of the state’s existing privacy laws. In November, he said the state worked with Connecticut and New York to reach $5.1 million in settlements against Illuminate, an education technology company that uses data to track and evaluate students’ progress, such as their testing scores and developmental milestones. The company had a data breach, exposing “sensitive information” from over 434,000 California students, the state attorney general’s office said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first time California successfully went after a company for violating the state’s landmark 2014 education privacy law.\n\nTo increase enforcement, Addis’ bill contains a new provision — the right for students and parents to sue tech companies in certain cases for privacy violations. Business and technology groups have opposed the bill, arguing that the new regulations and the right to sue would stifle investment in AI-powered learning tools.\n\nKing said that giving consumers the right to sue is often the only way to increase enforcement. Otherwise, the onus is on individual consumers to find concerning practices and try to opt out.\n\nDespite being an expert in data privacy, King said that she struggled at first to figure out how to delete her TeamSnap account, only later to discover that she needed to send an email to the company. She laughed at the irony, since it’s these kinds of dark patterns in user design that fuel part of her research.\n\nIn academia, the strategy of trapping customers is sometimes called the “roach motel,” she explained, a reference to a popular television ad from the late 1970s for a cockroach trap.\n\n“You can check in,” she said, “but you can never check out.”",

    "description": "The President’s Day weekend excursion, including a group of moms, wives and close friends who shared a passion for skiing the untracked powder of the hushed, untamed wilderness of California’s Sierra ...",
    "fullText": "The eight friends found joy in the mountains, skiing together across the untracked powder of the hushed, pristine wilderness of California’s Sierra Nevada – their close friendship standing out against a rugged, unforgiving terrain.\n\nThe trip had been planned well in advance: A three-day expedition that began at Frog Lake Backcountry Huts – a hard-to-reach but cozy oasis 7,600 feet high in the Tahoe National Forest area, accessible only by ski, snowboard or snowshoe.\n\nThe group – mothers, wives and passionate, skilled skiers – came from different parts of the country for a professionally guided backcountry tour over President’s Day weekend. With four guides and three other people accompanying them, they glided on skis near the frozen lake and snow-capped cliffs, under the shadow of a ridge dotted with red firs and Jeffrey pines.\n\nThe biggest winter storm of the new year loomed over the picturesque mountains, meanwhile, as dire warnings from forecasters echoed on social media.\n\nIt was the last day of a perilous backcountry odyssey. And, as predicted, the blizzard arrived, delivering blankets of unstable powder. They were headed home when the fresh snow, light and soft, suddenly descended from the slopes as one of the most ferocious forces of nature.\n\n“Avalanche!” one of them yelled.\n\nWithin seconds, a tsunami of ice, snow and debris the size of a football field careened downhill around them, thick enough to nearly bury a house, authorities said, citing the accounts of survivors.\n\n“It overtook them rather quickly,” Nevada County Sheriff’s Capt. Rusty Greene later told reporters.\n\nThe first call for help was a silent text message from an emergency beacon, mobilizing a small army of rescuers dispatched from different directions.\n\n“Medical for avalanche in the area of Castle Peak,” a voice on a fire department dispatch channel said at 10:45 a.m. Tuesday.\n\n“Nine to ten people buried, three others attempting to dig them out,” someone said in the audio as emergency responders were heard coordinating search and rescue efforts, noting no air support was available because of the storm.\n\nAn hours-long fight for survival was beginning. Some members of the group dug desperately into the snow for friends and partners as the powder began to turn into a freezing, concrete-like crust.\n\nSix of the close friends and three guides are among the nine people killed or presumed dead in the avalanche near California’s Lake Tahoe - the nation’s deadliest in 45 years. Six skiers survived and were rescued.\n\nSisters Liz Clabaugh and Caroline Sekar were among the dead. The others were identified by their families as Carrie Atkin, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse and Kate Vitt. A spouse of a Tahoe Nordic Search and Rescue team member – who responded to the disaster – was also among those killed.\n\nThe families of the six women who perished said in a statement that they still have “many unanswered questions.” The sheriff’s office said it is investigating whether criminal negligence contributed to the incident.\n\n“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said. “Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women.”\n\nThe families asked for privacy as they grieve a “sudden and profound loss.” The friends – from Idaho, the Bay Area and the nearby Truckee-Tahoe region – were “passionate, skilled skiers who cherished time together in the mountains.” They had trained for the backcountry, trusted their guides and carried and were familiar with avalanche safety equipment, according to the statement.\n\nThe bodies of the eight dead skiers remain on the icy mountainside because of the treacherous conditions, the sheriff’s department said. One other person is unaccounted for and presumed dead, according to Moon.\n\n“We are heartbroken and are doing our best to care for one another and our families in the way we know these women would have wanted,” the families said.\n\nOnly two members of the friends’ group survived, as well as a guide and two other skiers on the tour.\n\nIn the end, one man and five women made it out, taking cover for hours under a tarp – “doing everything they can” until rescuers on snowcats and skies could reach them, according to Greene.\n\nRescuers trudged through the heavy snow, combatting gale force winds under white-out conditions and mindful that another avalanche could potentially barrel down from above, Sheriff Moon said.\n\nRescuers were 2 miles from the skiers when their machinery got stuck, forcing them to ski the rest of the way until they reached the avalanche site around 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, the sheriff said. The survivors used avalanche beacons and iPhone Emergency SOS via satellite to text emergency services.\n\nAn emergency official communicated with a guide for more than four hours, relaying critical information to sheriff’s deputies, according to Don O’Keefe, chief of law enforcement at California’s Office of Emergency Services.\n\nBuried in an avalanche, few people are able to dig themselves out, according to experts. Within minutes, breathing creates an ice mask around the face. The snow eventually hardens like a concrete entombment.\n\nIf pulled out within 15 minutes, the Utah Avalanche Center says, 93% of avalanche victims live. After 45 minutes, only 20% to 30% survive. Few make it after two hours under the snow.\n\nSurvivors assemble tent-pole-like probes and stick them into the snow in hopes of striking buried skiers, according to experts.\n\nThat Tuesday morning, they frantically poked through the hardening snow for their ski partners and friends. Eventually they dug out three people who were no longer alive, the sheriff said.\n\n“Uncovering people who are deceased, that they know and probably cared about, is just horrible,” Nevada County Undersheriff Sam Brown told CBS News.\n\nKurt Gensheimer was on a three-night trip at Frog Lake Backcountry Huts and left Sunday, just hours before the moms and the other skiers arrived. They never crossed paths.\n\nHe had been there four times in the last four years and understood the pull of the dangerous yet beautiful surroundings.\n\n“It’s a magical place,” Gensheimer told CNN affiliate KCRA. “It’s one of the best places to backcountry ski in the country and Frog Lake Huts are the nicest amenities, possibly in North America, for backcountry skiing.”\n\nHe considered the huts a safe place to ride out a storm but his group decided to leave before the blizzard.\n\n“The discussion in the huts was, this is a big storm coming… It’s going to be falling blizzard conditions. You either should get out by Monday or plan to be there till Thursday, Friday,” Gensheimer said.\n\nThe tour company that organized the ill-fated trip, Blackbird Mountain Guides, said the tour leaders were highly trained and certified in avalanche education.\n\nIt was also aware of the avalanche danger.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the same day the group embarked on their journey, the company warned on Facebook of a big snow storm approaching and urged skiers to monitor to the Sierra Avalanche Center and “use extra caution this week!”\n\nThat morning, the Sierra Avalanche Center issued an avalanche watch that was elevated to a warning at 5 a.m. on Tuesday: “HIGH avalanche danger exists in the backcountry.\n\nThe most dangerous time for avalanches is after a rapid snowfall, according to experts. Tuesday’s avalanche was classified as a D2.5 on a five-level scale that measures the destructive potential of moving debris, according to Moon.\n\nThe allure of backcountry skiing endures despite the risks.\n\nNate Greenberg, who lives in the Eastern Sierra Mountains and said he survived an avalanche in 2021, advised against rushing to judgment. Backcountry skiing, he said, involves multiple “micro decisions.”\n\nIan McCammon, an engineer and avalanche researcher, also stressed the difficult decision making process on the slopes.\n\n“There’s usually a lot more than meets the eye to those accidents,” McCammon told CNN. “Once you start getting into the specifics, you start understanding. It’s easy to say that the people are foolish, or it’s easy to say that people have taken a lot of risks, but sometimes they’re in situations where it’s not obvious to see how they came to the decision that they did.”\n\nSara Boilen, a clinical psychologist and backcountry skier in Montana who specializes on human factors in avalanche terrain, said: “We’re all desperate to understand what happened.”\n\n“As a researcher, I want to understand so that we can deepen our sense of what is hard about decision making in the backcountry,” she told CNN. “As an educator, I want to understand so I can help others learn. As a backcountry user, I want to strengthen my own decision making by learning from others. And as a human I want answers - how could something like this happen? And we may never get all of the answers. That’s the thing about a wicked learning environment.”\n\nShe added, “Imagine losing somebody you love and simultaneously losing the relationship you have to the place you go to feel better. So, when you lose somebody in an avalanche and the mountains are the place that you feel most whole, most alive, it’s where you go for healing, what do you do?”\n\nCNN’s Nouran Salahieh, Elizabeth Wolfe, Chris Boyette, Cindy Von Quednow, Alisha Ebrahimji, Chris Dolce, Mary Gilbert, Martin Goillandeau, Chimaine Pouteau, Stephanie Elam, Diego Mendoza, Karina Tsui, Danya Gainor, Briana Waxman, Andi Babineau and Brad Parks contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah (AP) — The Pentagon and the Energy Department for the first time airlifted a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah, demonstrating what they say is the U.S. potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.\n\nThe nearly 700-mile flight last weekend — which transported a 5-megawatt microreactor without nuclear fuel — highlights the Trump administration’s drive to promote nuclear energy to help meet skyrocketing demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, as well as for use by the military.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright and Undersecretary of Defense Michael Duffey, who traveled with the privately built reactor, hailed the Feb. 15 trip on a C-17 military aircraft as a breakthrough for U.S. efforts to fast-track commercial licensing for the microreactors, part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the country's energy landscape.\n\nPresident Donald Trump supports nuclear power — a carbon-free source of electricity — as a reliable energy source, even as he has been broadly hostile to renewable energy and prioritizes coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity.\n\nSkeptics warn that nuclear energy poses risks and say microreactors may not be safe or feasible and have not proved they can meet demand for a reasonable price.\n\nWright brushed those concerns aside as he touted progress on Trump’s push for a quick escalation of nuclear power. Trump signed a series of executive orders last year that allow Wright to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.\n\n“Today is history. A multi-megawatt, next-generation nuclear power plant is loaded in the C-17 behind us,” Wright said before the two-hour flight from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n\nThe minivan-sized reactor transported by the military is one of at least three that will reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain an ongoing series of reactions — by July 4, as Trump has promised, Wright said.\n\n“That’s speed, that’s innovation, that’s the start of a nuclear renaissance,” he said.\n\nCurrently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S. that generate about 19% of the country’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's down from 104 reactors in 2013 and includes two new commercial reactors in Georgia that were the nation's first large reactors built from scratch in a generation.\n\nRecognizing delays inherent to deployment of new, full-scale reactors, the industry and government have focused in recent years on more efficient designs, including a small modular reactor proposed by the nation’s largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nMicroreactors, designed to be portable, can “accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it’s needed,” Duffey said. Eventually, the mobile reactors could provide energy security on a military base without the civilian grid, he and other officials said.\n\nThe demonstration flight “gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.\n\nThe reactor transported to Utah will be able to generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, said Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, the California startup that produced the reactor. The company hopes to start selling power on a test basis next year and become fully commercial in 2028.\n\nEdwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the transport flight — which included a throng of reporters, photographers and TV news crews — was little more than “a dog-and-pony show” that merely demonstrated the Pentagon's ability to ship a piece of heavy equipment.\n\nThe flight “doesn't answer any questions about whether the project is feasible, economic, workable or safe — for the military and the public,” Lyman said in an interview.\n\nThe Trump administration “hasn't made the safety case” for how microreactors, once loaded with nuclear fuel, can be transported securely to data centers or military bases, Lyman said.\n\nOfficials also have not resolved how nuclear waste will be disposed of, although Wright said the Energy Department is in talks with Utah and other states to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal.\n\nThe microreactor flown to Utah will be sent to the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab for testing and evaluation, Wright said. Fuel will be provided by the Nevada National Security site, Taylor said.\n\n“The answer to energy is always more,” Wright said. After four years of restrictions on fossil fuels and other polluting energy under the Biden administration, he said, “Now we’re trying to set everything free. And nuclear will be flying soon.”",

    "fullText": "After meeting with unspecified tech leaders, senator calls for urgent policy action as companies race to build ever more powerful systems\n\nBernie Sanders has warned that Congress and the American public have “not a clue” about the scale and speed of the coming AI revolution, pressing for urgent policy action to “slow this thing down” as tech companies race to build ever-more powerful systems.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford University on Friday alongside congressman Ro Khanna after a series of meetings with industry leaders in California, Sanders was blunt about what he called the “most dangerous moment in the modern history of this country”.\n\n“The Congress and the American people are very unprepared for the tsunami that is coming,” he said.\n\nKhanna, a progressive Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, shared Sanders’s concerns, warning that the country was experiencing a “new gilded age” run by tech billionaires who believe “they would have been heroic conquerors in a different era”.\n\n“That’s just not my observation,” Khanna said. “That’s what they tell me.”\n\nKhanna and Sanders declined to specify which tech executives they met with during the senator’s visit to California, but the congressman said it was “senior leaders” at the “most prominent tech companies”.\n\n“I think it was important for both Senator Sanders to hear from tech leaders and tech leaders to hear from Senator Sanders, who represents and understands the concerns of so many working-class Americans,” Khanna said in an interview after the event.\n\nDuring his remarks, Sanders reissued his call for a moratorium on the expansion of AI data centers to “slow down the revolution and protect workers” while policymakers catch up.\n\nKhanna does not want a moratorium, but has instead pushed to “steer” AI, advocating for the US to adopt a “Singapore model” for data center growth, with an emphasis on renewable energy and water efficiency. In his remarks before an auditorium of mostly students, Khanna outlined seven principles to guard against “oligarchic capture and dominance” of wealth generated by AI innovation.\n\n“We must ask not what America can do for Silicon Valley, but what Silicon Valley must do for America,” said the congressman, who is eyed as considering a 2028 presidential bid.\n\nThe event capped a days-long visit to California, a state he won in the 2020 presidential primary and where he returned to rally thousands during his Fight Oligarchy tour last year. In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Sanders delivered a scathing denunciation of the “greed” of the billionaire class. There he helped formally launch a campaign for a ballot initiative that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth more than $1bn – a proposal that has already prompted some ultra-wealthy tech leaders to flee, or threaten to do so.\n\nAt Stanford, Sanders focused his remarks on his concerns over how AI would impact not only the labor force but personal wellbeing and people’s ability to interact with one another. He mentioned that a restaurant in DC offered a Valentine’s Day special for people and their “AI buddies”, which drew laughs from the students.\n\nIt may seem funny, Sanders said, “but the truth is that a lot of people are becoming dependent upon AI for their emotional support. What is the long-term impact of that? What is the long-term impact if we lose work as an important part of our lives? What do we do with our lives?”\n\nSanders read statements from industry leaders who have predicted widespread automation, and cited projections that AI and robotics could eliminate tens of millions of jobs in the coming decade – from truck drivers to fast‑food workers and many white‑collar roles.\n\nPolling has found Americans are deeply concerned, as federal regulators and states debate how to impose guardrails on the nascent but fast-developing technology. A 2025 Pew survey found that 64% of the public thinks AI “will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”. Just 17% of Americans say “AI will have a very or somewhat positive impact on the United States” over the same period.\n\nThe tech CEOs leading the AI race have argued that AI will drive productivity, innovation and new kinds of employment as technological advancements have always done. But critics, like Sanders, say the “unprecedented” speed and scale of the changes threaten to enrich the “multibillionaires” while deepening inequality and leaving policymakers and the public ill-equipped to mount a response in time.\n\nSander urged his colleagues in Washington – and the public – to begin a serious public debate about the future of work as AI disrupts the economy, democracy and people’s emotional lives.\n\n“AI and robotics are neither good nor bad,” he said. “The question is: will a handful of billionaires benefit from it, or will the general public benefit?”",

    "description": "Famous people from Elon Musk to Glen Powell have moved to Texas recently, many from the comparatively more expensive state of California. Here's why.",
    "fullText": "Roseanne Barr's son, Jake Pentland, told Us Weekly in June 2025 that his famous mother had traded the Hollywood Hills for Texas Hill Country, a region in central Texas that includes cities like Austin and New Braunfels.\n\n\"My mom lives with me, my wife, and my two daughters — she's the best grandma,\" Pentland told the magazine.\n\nIn a separate June interview with Fox News Digital, Barr said living in Texas is a \"dream come true\" and described what her new life looks like.\n\n\"I'm doing a lot of mowing. I've got a really fantastic tractor out here, and I'm mowing,\" Barr said. \"The only problem is I don't clear the trees quite as good as I should, and I'm always hitting a tree and knocking it over, and it always hits me in the head.\"\n\nA native of Texas, Duff decided with her fiancé Matt Rosenberg to pack up the kids and leave California once the pandemic hit.\n\nAt first, she was nervous that the move would hurt her career.\n\n\"I think so much of my fear of moving out of Los Angeles was that my career was there and that I would never work again or something like that,\" she told Fox News Digital in 2022. \"And, you know, I think this has all taught us that Zoom certainly can be a very powerful tool. And we can, you know, very luckily for me, get to continue to work from here, and I get to live near my dad. I haven't lived, here, near my dad in a really long time.\"\n\nThe son of Clint Eastwood, Scott has been methodically building his own career, showing up in the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise and Guy Ritchie movies.\n\nDuring his downtime in Texas, he does everything from fishing to hunting.\n\n\"I think that's why people who come to Texas really can fall in love with it,\" he told Flaunt in 2021 from his home in Austin. \"There's more community, people are more neighborly, people are nice. It slows life down a little bit. It's not this fast-paced living in a big city like New York or Los Angeles.\"\n\nAfter spending most of her life jet-setting around the world trying to conquer the modeling industry, Hadid decided recently to take some time away from the spotlight.\n\nIn early 2024, she spoke to Allure about moving to Texas to focus on her mental and physical health (she was diagnosed with Lyme Disease in 2013), and be with her cowboy boyfriend Adan Banuelos.\n\n\"Just as I have styled myself for years now — which I still do — I love being able to do my own hair and makeup, be happy with how I look, and get ready with my girlfriends here in Texas,\" Hadid told Allure. \"We have the best time, and I never feel like I need to do too much.\"\n\n\"For the first time now, I'm not putting on a fake face. If I don't feel good, I won't go. If I don't feel good, I take time for myself. And I've never had the opportunity to do that or say that before,\" Hadid added. \"Now when anybody sees me in pictures and they say I look happy, I genuinely am. I am feeling better; my bad days now were my old good days.\"\n\nHarrelson lived in Hawaii for many years before moving back to his home state of Texas in 2023.\n\nNow in the Lone Star State and living just outside Austin, the actor has lobbied alongside longtime friend Matthew McConaughey to make Texas a hub for film and television production.\n\nIn 2025, the Texas House approved Senate Bill 22, which provides $300 million every two years through 2035 to support the local film industry.\n\nIn 2021, the rapper-turned-television producer and entrepreneur announced on X that he was living in Houston.\n\nThe star has enjoyed visiting Austin for decades but finally decided to live there in 2020.\n\n\"I love it. I've been coming here for 20 years,\" he told \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\" in 2020. \"I'm much closer to my mom and everybody. I love it. It's great.\"\n\nThe former mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter turned TikTok food critic has set up shop in Texas.\n\nAfter living in Las Vegas, Lee relocated to Texas in November 2024. In a December video reviewing the downtown Dallas restaurant The Wicked Butcher, he revealed that he now lives in Dallas.\n\n\"One thing I do love about the Dallas food scene — we've been here a month, a month and a half — they do have some nice fine dining restaurants,\" Lee said.\n\nOscar-winner Matthew McConaughey and wife Camila Alves settled in Austin in 2012 after buying a 10,800-square-foot mansion.\n\nAccording to a 2024 profile in Southern Living, the move to Texas was initially because of a \"family crisis,\" when he needed to help his mother and two brothers. The couple decided to stay put and raise their three children there.\n\n\"Ritual came back,\" McConaughey said of being back in Texas. \"Whether that was Sunday church, sports, dinner together as a family every night, or staying up after that telling stories in the kitchen, sitting at the island pouring drinks and nibbling while retelling them all in different ways than we told them before.\"\n\nIn July, Elon Musk vowed to move two of his companies, X and SpaceX, out of California and into Texas. He already moved Telsa to Texas in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, Musk announced that he had already moved to Texas himself at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council summit.\n\nMusk has claimed to own a tiny home in Texas, and records show he bought a house in Austin in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, O'Neal bought a 5,269-square-foot home in Carrollton listed at $1,224,000 and sold it in 2024 for an undisclosed amount, though it was listed for $1.7 million, according to Realtor.com.\n\nThat year, Chexy Trust, tied to the Carrollton purchase, bought a 4,670-square-foot home in Rockwall County. In 2024, O'Neal opened a branch of his Big Chicken chain restaurant in Fort Worth.\n\nAs his footprint in the region grows, he told WFAA he plans to make the area his home base.\n\n\"I'm 75% going to move here full time,\" O'Neal said in June. \"I have to see what's going on with TNT next year, but based on that, you'll probably be seeing a lot more of me.\"\n\nThe \"Twisters\" star, who is also a native Texan, moved back to Austin from Los Angeles recently to be close to his family and for his own mental health.\n\n\"When all you do is consume movies and entertainment, you could become a little self-aware and maybe derivative of yourself,\" Powell told USA Today. \"Your personal life, there's no sort of freedom there, there's storytelling around that, and I feel like that's just not good for you on the long term.\"\n\nPadalecki ditched Hollywood for Texas before it was a trend. The \"Supernatural\" star, a San Antonio native, relocated from Los Angeles to Austin with his wife, Genevieve, in 2012.\n\nIn an Instagram video taken on Austin's 24th Street in 2020, he explained why he loves the city so much.\n\n\"Austin brings me a warmth and a happiness and a peace that I have been unable to find anywhere else in my travels,\" Padalecki said. \"I love being here.\"\n\nIn 2025, former \"Selling Sunset\" star Christine Quinn relocated to her home state of Texas after splitting from her ex-husband, tech entrepreneur Christian Dumontet.\n\nQuinn now lives in a suburb outside Dallas with her young son, Christian.\n\n\"I am really, really grateful to be living here,\" Quinn told People in January, adding that she's happy to be closer to family. \"I have a sister who lives really close to me, and my son has a cousin. So it's really something that I needed as opposed to the chaos when I was in Los Angeles.\"\n\nLike many other celebs, Rogan left Los Angeles once the pandemic hit.\n\nIn a 2023 episode of his popular podcast, \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" he explained why he ended up in Texas.\n\n\"Then we went to the lake, and people are playing music and jumping in the water,\" said Rogan, adding that his kids \"were like, 'We want to live here!'\"\n\n\"That was it. Two months later, I lived here,\" he said in the podcast episode.\n\n\"The Sopranos\" star moved to Austin in 2021 with her family, husband Cutter Dykstra, and sons Beau and Jack.\n\n\"I almost feel more connected to my craft and why I love acting,\" Sigler told The New York Times in 2021. \"When the calls come in, it's a beautiful surprise. I'm still on things and I'm still a businesswoman and it's still my career, but I don't feel the pressure around it because we took a stand for ourselves and we made decisions for our families.\"",

In 2022, the DMV had accused Tesla of misleading consumers by using “autopilot” and “full self-driving” for its advanced driver-assistance features.\n\nThe DMV narrowed its focus in December to the term “autopilot” as Tesla revised its use of the term “full self-driving” to clarify that driver supervision is required. “Autopilot” enables Tesla vehicles to accelerate, brake and remain within their lanes on highways. “Full self-driving” allows vehicles to change lanes and respond to traffic signals on city streets.\n\nThe judge had recommended that regulators suspend Tesla’s license to sell cars for 30 days, but the regulators gave the company a 90-day window to make changes. They decided it had done that sufficiently to fix the deceptive marketing.\n\nThe reprieve from the California DMV comes as Tesla and other electric vehicle makers grapple with a plunge in demand after the expiration of key tax credits that had boosted sales. Musk has switched the company’s focus toward robotaxis equipped with self-driving technology, as well as humanoid robots.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — Andrej Stojakovic scored 22 points to lead seven players in double figures and No. 10 Illinois routed Southern California 101-65 on Wednesday night for its 14th win in 16 games.\n\nBlue and orange-clad fans were out in force for the Fighting Illini’s first game against the Trojans in Los Angeles since 1975. The Illini (22-5, 13-3 Big Ten) didn’t disappoint, leading all the way to maintain a hold on second place in the conference standings behind No. 1 Michigan.\n\nThe Illini were up by 22 at halftime, and poured it on to start the second half. They outscored the Trojans 21-10, hitting five 3-pointers and extending the lead to 75-42. Stojakovic capped the spurt with a steal and one-handed slam that drew cheers.\n\nStojakovic was 6 of 7 from the floor and made all nine of his free throws. David Mirkovic added 14 points. The Illini hit 24 of 26 free throws while sending USC to its biggest loss of the season.\n\nIllinois made 13 3-pointers, and at one point in the second half was shooting equally as well from long range as from the floor overall (46%). Visiting fans took turns shouting “I-L-L” with the other side of the arena responding “I-N-I.”\n\nEzra Ausar scored 15 points and Jacob Cofie added 14 for USC (18-8, 7-8), which lost its second straight and fell to 0-4 against ranked teams. The Trojans were without second-leading scorer Chad Baker-Mazara (18.3 points per game) because of a strained knee. They committed 14 turnovers that led to 22 points for the Illini.\n\nIllinois visits UCLA on Saturday.\n\nUSC remains in the Pacific time zone for its final five Big Ten games, starting Saturday when Oregon visits.",

States, including California, have been among the main foils to various ⁠Trump administration policies, launching dozens of suits. California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Tuesday told Reuters about plans to ​sue over ​changes in vaccine policy and ​a plan to challenge ‌the rescission of a key Environmental Protection Agency finding, known as the endangerment finding, that was key to climate change regulation, for instance.\n\nThe new suit responds in part to California's loss of $1.2 billion in federal funding for ‌the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen ​Energy Systems, or ARCHES, Bonta ​said. The hydrogen plan ​was intended to replace fossil fuels in ‌utilities, public transit, trucking and ​ports.\n\nFederal agencies must ​execute laws, California said. \"It's as simple as Congress has the power of the purse, not the executive ​branch, and Congress ‌already appropriated this funding,\" Bonta said in an ​interview on Tuesday, ahead of the announcement.",

Gymnast Carlos Yulo won two gold medals at the Paris Olympics.\n\nAnd now Alpine skier Tallulah Proulx has become the first female athlete from the Philippines to compete in the Winter Olympics — and at 17, the youngest ever from the Southeast Asian country.\n\n“This is a new era for the Philippines and sports on the global stage and I really am grateful that I get to be a part of it,” the U.S.-born Proulx said as she finished 50th in the slalom at the Milan Cortina Games on Wednesday after carrying her country’s flag during the opening ceremony.\n\nShe was 52nd in the giant slalom.\n\nProulx grew up skiing at the Sierra Tahoe resort in California, then moved at age 7 to Iowa and raced at tiny Sundown Mountain before moving on Colorado and then settling in Park City, Utah, where she now resides.\n\nProulx’s father is from the Eastern Samar province in the Philippines’ Eastern Visayas region.\n\n“And I have a lot of relatives, family back there and honestly the response has been so heartwarming,” Proulx said. “Filipinos are just such warm and welcoming people. … I think that’s what makes us really strong and I’m so grateful that I get to be the first Filipina because I show that others can follow in my footsteps and hopefully get more involved into winter sports, which I know is quite hard in the Philippines.”\n\nProulx was slated to visit the Philippines for the first time a few years ago before her trip got canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, she has emersed herself in the country’s culture, thanks to her grandmother.\n\n“Me and my brother grew up with her cooking — all of course the delicious Filipino food and sharing her culture,” Proulx said. “Unfortunately, last year she passed away. … I really wanted to push for this and wanted to represent such an important part of my heritage, both for her and for myself.”\n\nIn Cortina, Proulx traded pins with American slalom standout Paula Moltzan and got a picture with slalom gold medalist Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\n“It’s amazing being around these people that I’ve looked up to my whole life,” she said, “and then realize I’m skiing that course next.”\n\nNext up for Proulx: a trip to the Philippines.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "A new frontrunner has emerged in California’s wide-open race for governor.\n\nConservative commentator Steve Hilton now leads the field with 17%, followed by Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell and Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican, who are tied at 14%, according to an Emerson College Polling/Inside California Politics survey of 1,000 likely voters released Wednesday.\n\nHilton is a former director of strategy for British Prime Minister David Cameron and a current Fox News contributor. He took in roughly $4.1 million in donations in the second half of 2025, according to campaign finance reports cited by CalMatters.\n\nBianco had a one point lead over Hilton and Swalwell in early December.\n\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter has 10% support in the latest poll and billionaire Tom Steyer has 9% – both are Democrats. Importantly, 21% of respondents said they remain undecided.\n\nPollsters noted that since December, support for Hilton and Steyer rose five points, support for Swalwell increased two points and support for Porter dipped by one point.\n\n“The Republican electorate in California is split between Steve Hilton at 38% and Chad Bianco at 37%, while Hilton also picks up a plurality of independent voters at 22%,” said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling. “Democratic voters have not yet clearly coalesced around one candidate.”\n\nOutside the top tier, San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan has struggled to gain traction since entering the race in late January.\n\n“Maybe its because he got in late, but the enthusiasm for his candidacy is not right now translating into votes,” noted political analyst Matt Klink.\n\nCalifornia’s primary is set for June 2. The two candidates with the most votes, regardless of party, will advance to the November general election to determine who will succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited.\n\nWith the race in flux, Klink said it is possible California voters could see two Republicans on the November ballot – and no Democrats.\n\n“It is mathematically possible that you could have two Republicans finishing one‑two in the primary,” he said. “That said, I believe the political brains in the Democratic Party will get involved and say we need to make sure we get one of our candidates into the runoff because he or she will likely win the general election.”\n\nThe survey was conducted Feb. 13-14 and carries a margin of error of 3 percentage points.\n\n• The survey found 44% approve of Gov. Newsom’s job performance, while 45% disapprove. That represents a three-point drop in approval and a six-point rise in disapproval since the December Emerson/Inside California Politics poll.\n\n• A majority of voters at 53% say they have considered leaving California because of the state’s cost of living.\n\n• Asked to identify the biggest strain on their household budgets, 28% cited housing, 21% utilities and 17% groceries.\n\n• On immigration policy, 41% prefer the Biden administration’s approach, 38% favor Trump’s and 21% prefer neither.\n\nMarc Sternfield is the Director of Digital Content at KTLA 5, where he oversees digital news strategy, streaming, and social media.

    "fullText": "Tesla has avoided a 30-day suspension of its dealer and manufacturer licenses in California. The cost: \"Autopilot.\"\n\nThe reprieve comes two months after the state ordered the automaker to stop using the term in its vehicle marketing.\n\nOn Tuesday, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Tesla had taken the required corrective action following a December administrative ruling over the marketing of its driver-assistance features.\n\nIn November 2023, the DMV accused Tesla of misleading consumers by advertising its systems — branded as \"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving\" — in ways that implied the vehicles were capable of autonomous driving.\n\nThe decision effectively ends a three-year legal fight between Tesla and California regulators. The state is critical for the EV maker — it's the car company's largest US sales market and home to two manufacturing hubs.\n\nAutopilot was the name of Tesla's Level-2 driver-assistance feature, including lane tracing and cruise control adjustment. The company's then-called Full-Self Driving included Level-3 driver assistance, in which the car would turn its wheels and apply the brakes, but required human eyes on the road and readiness to take control at a moment's notice.\n\nAn administrative law judge in November 2025 concluded that Tesla's use of the term \"Autopilot\" violated California law and recommended suspending the company's licenses for 30 days if the automaker continued using the branding in its marketing materials.\n\nThe DMV adopted the judge's findings in December but permanently stayed the suspension and gave Tesla 60 days to comply.\n\nTesla had already modified its \"Full Self-Driving\" branding to \"Full Self-Driving (Supervised)\" in September 2024.\n\nThe company also clarified that the system worked \"with minimal driver intervention.\"\n\n🤔 @Tesla is no longer selling \"FSD\" as a package. They are only selling \"FSD (Supervised)\". And there is no longer the promise that car will completely drive itself: only that car will drive \"with minimal driver intervention\"\n\nI don't think we are getting anything more than… pic.twitter.com/w88ptYDZ2W\n\nIn January, Tesla discontinued its Autopilot packages for new vehicles in the US and Canada and eliminated the $8,000 upfront purchase option for Full Self-Driving (Supervised).\n\nThe move leaves FSD (Supervised) available only as a $99-per-month subscription, further tying Tesla's self-driving ambitions to recurring software revenue.\n\nBoosting self-driving subscriptions is an integral part of CEO Elon Musk's potential trillion-dollar pay package.",

    "fullText": "If you have peanut butter at home, it may be time to take a closer look at the label.\n\nFederal officials say more than 20,000 peanut butter products sold nationwide — including in California — are being recalled after potential plastic contamination was discovered during manufacturing.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the peanut butter was manufactured by Ventura Foods, a major food company headquartered in Southern California, and sold under multiple private-label brand names in 40 states, including California.\n\nInspectors found pieces of blue plastic in a production filter, prompting the recall, according to the FDA. While the recall began in April 2025, the agency formally classified it as a Class II recall on Feb. 12, meaning exposure could cause temporary or medically reversible health problems, but the risk of serious injury is considered low\n\nCalifornia is among the states where the recalled peanut butter products were distributed, according to the FDA.\n\nThe products were primarily single-serve packets and small cups, often used in schools, hospitals, hotels and food-service settings, rather than large retail jars.\n\nAccording to the FDA, the recalled products include:\n\nCreamy peanut butter packets in 0.5-ounce and 0.75-ounce cups, and 1.12-ounce packs\n\nTwin packs of creamy peanut butter with strawberry jam, in 1-ounce and 1.12-ounce cups\n\nTwin packs of creamy peanut butter with grape jelly, in 1-ounce and 1.12-ounce cups\n\nThe products were sold under private-label brands such as US Foods, Sysco House Recipe, DYMA Brands, Flavor Fresh, Katy’s Kitchen, and Gordon Food Service, the FDA said.\n\nMore: Over 22,000 pounds of ground beef recalled over E. coli risk\n\nVentura Foods is headquartered in California, with corporate offices listed in Brea and Irvine.\n\nThe privately held company is a major food manufacturer, employing about 4,000 people nationwide, with a significant portion of its workforce based in California.\n\nVentura Foods operates 14 manufacturing plants and three culinary centers across North America and produces food products that end up in restaurants, institutions and grocery stores across the country.\n\nWhile this recall involves peanut butter made for private-label customers, Ventura Foods’ broader portfolio extends far beyond peanut products.\n\nAccording to company profiles, Ventura Foods manufactures and supplies:\n\nPan coatings and liquid butter alternatives\n\nMany of its products are used behind the scenes in restaurants, schools, and hospitals, rather than sold directly under the Ventura Foods name in grocery stores.\n\nConsumers in California and other affected states are urged to check product labels carefully, especially on small peanut butter packets or combination peanut butter-and-jelly cups.\n\nThe FDA recommends following the retailer or manufacturer's instructions on whether recalled products should be returned or safely discarded.\n\nAnyone who experiences health issues after consuming the recalled products should contact a medical professional, the agency said\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Springs Desert Sun: Ventura Foods peanut butter recall in California possible plastic",

    "fullText": "A storm system moving across Southern California brought rain to the desert and snow to the nearby mountains Monday, Feb. 16, with more precipitation expected over the next couple days.\n\nCloudy skies and steady rain arrived around midday in western parts of the Coachella Valley, with cooler temperatures than in recent days.\n\n“We’re kind of seeing the brunt of (the storms) move through at the moment,” Chandler Price, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s San Diego office, said Monday afternoon.\n\n“After that, we’re going to get showers through tomorrow (Tuesday) morning, then lightening up mid-to-late morning, then probably like 10 hours of sort of clear skies before the next (system) comes roaring in late Tuesday into early Wednesday,” he added.\n\nAs of about 3 p.m. Monday, the Palm Springs International Airport had recorded 0.10 inches of rainfall, while in the mid-valley, Thousand Palms had seen 0.12 inches.\n\nTo the east, Indian Palms Country Club in Indio had recorded just a trace of rain — 0.02 inches — as of Monday afternoon.\n\nThe Riverside area had seen a wider range of rainfall totals as of 3 p.m.\n\nThe northern side of Riverside had recorded about 0.15 inches of rainfall, while Jurupa Valley, located just west of Riverside, had seen 0.57 inches so far.\n\n“It’s a pretty big range there (in Riverside),” Price said.\n\nIn the nearby San Jacinto and San Gorgonio mountains, a winter storm warning is in effect until noon Wednesday, with the areas potentially seeing up to 3 feet of snow at higher elevation levels.\n\n“Travel could be very difficult to impossible,” the weather service said in its winter weather advisory. “The hazardous conditions could impact the Monday evening and Tuesday morning commutes. Very strong winds could cause extensive tree damage.”\n\nPrice said snow was starting to cover the roads in the Idyllwild-Pine Cove area above 6,000 feet as of Monday afternoon, but he added the weather service did not yet have exact precipitation totals.\n\nThe Big Bear area was also seeing snowfall Monday afternoon, though exact totals were not yet available. At a slightly lower elevation than Big Bear, Lake Arrowhead had recorded 2 inches of rain as of 3 p.m.\n\nPrice said Palm Springs could see another tenth of an inch of rain through Tuesday morning, with less precipitation expected in the central and southern parts of the valley.\n\nRiverside and the rest of the Inland Empire will likely see higher precipitation levels, potentially up to an inch through early Wednesday.\n\n“It’s really going to start dying down after 6 a.m. Wednesday, and then by noon, we’re looking at completely dry (conditions),” Price said.\n\nOvernight lows will stay in the 40s throughout most of Riverside County this week.\n\nAnother system could hit the region Thursday, potentially bringing more rain to the Inland Empire, though Price said it will likely be weaker than the storms earlier in the week.\n\nCity News Service contributed to this report.\n\nTom Coulter is a reporter for The Desert Sun.

    "description": "I moved to New York City to pursue a career in fashion journalism. After a few years at my \"dream job,\" I felt burned out and had to redefine success.",
    "fullText": "Ever since I heard Taylor Swift's \"Welcome to New York\" for the first time, the city called my name.\n\nOf course, I was grateful for my suburban upbringing in California, but my town was too small for my aspirations. I wanted to live the life of a fashion journalist, and to me, that required being in New York City.\n\nFixated on my goal, I mapped out a plan in college to secure as many internships and part-time writing gigs as possible, then fling the industry door wide open.\n\nI went on to land a job at a Los Angeles public relations agency before breaking into editorial with a remote position at a lifestyle publication. Then, a few months later, I got a job at one of NYC's most prominent newspapers. It wasn't strictly focused on fashion, but it was my entry point.\n\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic meant I had to spend the first six months working from California, I was excited to move to New York as soon as possible.\n\nWithout knowing a single soul, I set off to the concrete jungle, armed with sheer ambition, nerves, and the belief that if I worked hard enough, I'd have that movie montage moment (cue \"Empire State of Mind\").\n\nI moved into an apartment on my own, and just like that, I was enveloped by the glittering scene that came with the gig, staring at my laptop until my eyes stung with tears and rubbing elbows with Hollywood's elite. It was a thrill, to say the least, but I still had my eyes on fashion.\n\nOne year later, I pulled it off, landing a role at the glossy I'd been collecting for nearly a decade.\n\nWithin days, my life changed: I was sitting front row at New York Fashion Week and juggling an output that seemed to multiply tenfold — making my heart race so fast my Oura ring began to flag stress spikes.\n\nThis new life shimmered from miles away, with friends and family saying, \"Your life is like a movie.\" By the world's standards, I had \"made it,\" but underneath the dazzling designer façade was a quiet truth no one had prepared me for.\n\nAttaining everything I'd dreamed of by 26 meant drowning in a sea of deadlines, navigating corporate politics, and feeling pressured to sustain my success — smack dab in the middle of a quarter-life crisis.\n\nThe increasing number of industry-wide layoffs also nixed the possibility of a promotion despite my best efforts. Still, the work accelerated and my responsibilities expanded. I was left feeling overlooked and depleted — and my mental health suffered.\n\nI began to question who I was apart from my career, if I wasn't climbing (and rising) to the top. What's worse is that this feeling began to seep into other areas of my life, feeding the lie that I didn't measure up.\n\nThat's when I realized \"making it\" couldn't be as simple as owning luxury handbags, interviewing stars, and typing up thousands of stories.\n\nInstead of feeling fulfilled, I was left with a strange ache that the life I'd worked so hard to achieve wasn't enough. So, I started re-evaluating how I wanted to live, my values, and where I saw myself in five years.\n\nI decided my next move would have to allow me to do what I love and still prioritize the other elements of my life that make me me: family, friendships, hobbies, and faith.\n\nStill, entertaining the concept of \"what comes next\" was unsettling, especially considering I'd up and moved my entire life just a few years prior, and I genuinely adored writing and style.\n\nI wondered whether pursuing something new would be a failure or if people would think I was weak. This inner debate gnawed at me for months, while work opportunities that once thrilled me felt like extra weight.\n\nBut finally, it clicked. Making a career change wouldn't be quitting or failing — I'd already clawed my way to the big leagues and thrived — and my purpose came from much more than my work.\n\nSo, nearly a year later, I left my dream job to freelance within the fashion space, deciding to stay within the industry and city I love — but on my own terms. Still, I'll always be grateful for the early years of my career; I couldn't have pursued my new path without them.\n\nAnd I know this won't be the final shift I make in my life, because it's the bends in the road that make it meaningful.\n\nAs it turns out, \"making it\" is a milestone that can be continually redefined, and landing my \"dream job\" was only the beginning of the story.",

    "description": "Moving from San Francisco to a smaller city in the Southern California countryside has come with benefits for our health and finances.",
    "fullText": "When I moved to San Francisco almost 13 years ago, I never imagined how much it would help my career — and, unexpectedly, lead me to fall in love with the country outside of it.\n\nI have always lived in cities, from Viña del Mar, Chile, where I was born, to Los Angeles, where I grew up. However, my marketing career didn't really take off until I moved to San Francisco, the epicenter of the startup boom.\n\nThere, I had everything I wanted: I was surrounded by potential clients, I dined at fancy restaurants, I made great friends, and I had no shortage of access to top music venues, cafés, bars, and wine-country weekends.\n\nI fell in love with San Francisco, which was like a huge playground for adults with no kids. It's also where I met and married the love of my life.\n\nBut in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the US, I had my first child and San Francisco (like many other big cities) seemed to empty out. That's when my husband and I decided we'd like to move closer to my parents in Los Angeles and buy a house with acreage.\n\nIt felt right after living in a small apartment in the city for so long — we wanted distance from other people, and the freedom to grow our own food, and live a calmer life.\n\nWe set our sights on a place in the Southern California countryside when we realized how much further our money could go there.\n\nOur new home is only about an hour from major cities, like Los Angeles and San Diego, but it's still the most remote place I've lived.\n\nThe city is also quite small, with a population of about 100,000 people — a stark contrast to the 800,000 in San Francisco and millions in Los Angeles.\n\nI didn't know what to expect when we moved, but I've found myself pleasantly surprised.\n\nLife seems to move slower and there's far less noise and light pollution. At night, our sky lights up with stars. Instead of traffic being spread all over, like in other cities we've lied in, it's mostly just confined to a few busy streets.\n\nOn top of getting much more house and yard than we could afford in a bigger city, we've found a lot of our everyday expenses, like groceries and gas, are about 20% cheaper here.\n\nOur city's small-town feel is refreshing and it's also been easy to build community. Strangers smile at us often, and locals have been welcoming and genuinely friendly. We've even become friends with all of our neighbors.\n\nI still get culture shock when I bump into acquaintances at the farmers market, or when the store clerk talks to us like we're old pals.\n\nThe biggest gossip topics around here are which fancy new apartment buildings might be built and the newest batch of coyotes.\n\nMy daughter also loves her school, which feels like a tight-knit community of families — many of whom also moved away from big cities.\n\nSure there's drawbacks. At times, living in a more remote area can also feel isolating.\n\nWe're far from friends, fun malls, and trendy gyms. Sometimes I miss going to fancy farmers markets and trying a new restaurant every week.\n\nGoing into a nearby bigger city takes planning and effort — especially if you have kids — and at least an hourlong drive.\n\nWe also have more limited shopping and grocery-store options, and scheduling doctor visits can be tricky when everyone goes to the same four clinics.\n\nHowever, what we've lost in big-city perks, we have gained back in nature with easy access to horses, hiking trails, farms, and petting zoos. We may be far from a Whole Foods, but we're close to neighbors who sell homemade bread, organic cheese, jam and goat milk.\n\nOur area is less diverse than the cities we left behind, but I've still found community here among people who share my values and interests.\n\nAnd all that we have here — space, time, fresh air, calm, community — has completely changed how I live and what I now prioritize. This move has felt like a reset to to my nervous system.\n\nI never imagined I would live in the country and love it — city friends are still skeptical when they come visit.\n\nHowever, seeing what's possible when you venture out of your comfort zone has even inspired some of them to move to more remote areas, too.\n\nStill, I'd never change the path that brought me here. San Francisco and Los Angeles are great cities with incredible energy — especially if you're early in your career — but at this stage of my life, the things that make me happy are in this cozy countryside.\n\nThe area feels very well-suited for aging. It's a place where slowing down isn't seen as \"failing\"; and being close to San Diego, with its world-class medical institutions, has made it easy to imagine staying here for the rest of our lives.",

    "fullText": "As Gavin Newsom departs, ultra-wealthy flex wealth and influence to fight regulation and keep the boom going\n\nTech billionaires are leveraging tens of millions of dollars to influence California politics in a marked uptick from their previous participation in affairs at the state capitol. Behemoths such as Google and Meta are getting involved in campaigns for November’s elections, as are venture capitalists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Palantir’s co-founders. The industry’s goals run the gamut – from fighting a billionaire tax to supporting a techie gubernatorial candidate to firing up new, influential super political action committees (Pacs).\n\nThe phenomenon squarely fits the moment for the state’s politics – with 2026 being the year that Politico has dubbed “the big tech flex”.\n\nGavin Newsom, California’s tech-friendly governor who’s been quick to veto legislation that cramps the sector’s unfettered growth, is reaching his term limit. That means Silicon Valley needs to find a new ally. The industry may have found its candidate in an upstart mayor from San Jose, Matt Mahan.\n\nSilicon Valley’s businesses and billionaires – some of the richest and most powerful on earth, most of which are headquartered in California – are in the midst of a massive AI boom. Industry insiders say tech companies need to ensure they can continue to flourish without regulations getting in the way.\n\n“This is a golden opportunity and a golden moment for tech to reset its priorities and its perceptions,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University who studies state lobbying.\n\nRather than going all-in on one candidate or issue, McCuan said the tech sector is using a multi-pronged attack in California. Tech billionaires are contributing to campaigns ranging from candidates for governor to local city council and school board races. They are also donating heavily to groups campaigning for relaxed taxation and minimal regulation around AI.\n\n“If you’re an uber-zillionaire, you give money early and often,” McCuan said. “They have more wealth and resources than they’ve ever had before, so that allows them to play on both sides of the aisle and up and down the ballot and across issues like never before.”\n\nUnlike other industries, such as oil and pharma, tech has been relatively tame when it comes to lobbying in the state. The industry has tended to focus on narrow state issues and instead spent big and broad at the federal level (aside from Uber and Lyft’s massive $200m ballot measure campaign in 2020). That ethos has changed. California is now ground zero for tech titans working to become omnipresent in politics.\n\nRobert Singleton, the senior director of policy in California for the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said this moment has been brewing for a long time and it just needed the right thing to set it off.\n\n“The introduction of that billionaire tax obviously galvanized a lot of wealthy individuals who don’t want to see that happen, and who will spend money to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Singleton said. “That tipped them into wanting to get more involved.”\n\nThe “California Billionaire Tax Act”, often referred to simply as the billionaire tax, is a proposal that would require any California resident worth more than $1bn to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state. It’s sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and if it receives enough signatures from California voters, it will go to the ballot in November.\n\nWhen the proposal was put forward at the end of last year, many among tech’s billionaire elite threw a tantrum.\n\nSome opened offices or bought mansions in Florida or Texas, vowing to leave California for good. The fleeing rich included Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, whose current net worth is $25bn; Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth around $255bn and $240bn respectively; and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, whose net worth is not publicly known. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, worth $229bn, has also bought a property in south Florida valued between $150 and $200m.\n\nThiel has additionally led the charge in donating to a lobbying group, the California Business Roundtable, which has pledged to fight the wealth tax. The Palantir co-founder handed over $3m to the political action committee in late December. Other major donors include realtors, entrepreneurs and private equity firms. James Siminoff, who founded the camera-embedded Ring doorbell company, also donated $100,000, according to public records.\n\n“The most powerful money in politics is to be on the no-side of a ballot measure,” said McCuan. “You can even pre-empt something getting to the ballot, like a billionaire’s tax, by explaining to everyone out there that this is a bad idea for economic growth.”\n\nTech investors and venture capitalists have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the tax, saying that the state will lose revenue as billionaires flee and it will hurt the state’s ability to be economically competitive.\n\nJust this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and current venture capital investor, wrote “the loss of this tax revenue was totally avoidable but is now forever”. Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, wrote, “the most successful tech founders of all time have now exited the failed state of California”.\n\nAdding on, Paul Graham, the co-founder of seed capital firm Y Combinator, wrote: “It’s important that people like Zuck and Larry Page are willing to move in response to the proposed wealth tax. It shows politicians what will happen if they try things like this.”\n\nJoining the billionaires, Newsom has pledged to fight the tax, saying it will “drive a race to the bottom” and stifle innovation as the ultra-wealthy leave. “This will be defeated – there’s no question in my mind,” Newsom told the New York Times in January. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nOutcry over taxes is just one of the ways the tech sector is ramping up its influence campaign. Several Super Pacs have popped up over the past few months and tech is injecting these committees with tens of millions.\n\nMcCuan said this strategy is helpful for the ultra-wealthy because it allows them to stay behind the scenes, while donating limitless money.\n\n“You could create some amorphous sounding organization like ‘Californians for All That is Good and Right Under the Sun’,” McCuan said. “And who knows what the hell that is, but that entity becomes the vehicle to which others give money … and it becomes very difficult to unpeel and unfurl what is going on.”\n\nMeta launched two new Super Pacs last fall, which are focused on dialing back AI regulation and supporting AI-friendly candidates. The company contributed $45m to one, the American Technology Excellence Project, which will operate in several states but hasn’t yet established a committee in California. The other, Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is state-specific and has received one $20m contribution from Meta.\n\nThe social media giant has also matched Google in infusing a separate Super Pac called California Leads with a total of $10m. Ron Conway, a longtime Democratic tech donor, has also donated $100,000 to this committee, which says it aims to support favorable candidates in the state but will not just focus on issues affecting the tech industry, according to Politico.\n\nThe crypto industry is getting into Super Pacs too, debuting a group called Grow California. The committee opened with $10m from crypto executive Chris Larsen and evangelist Tim Draper. Larsen told the New York Times he plans to give $30m more. The focus of Grow California is to “rebuild a state capital” and shape the state’s legislature.\n\n“We have a group of people who are not acting in a pragmatic way. They’re not looking for balance. They’re completely fucking owned by one side,” Larsen, who’s the chair of crypto company Ripple, told Politico. “So we’re going to work on taking out those people who are not working for the people of California.”\n\nWhile the tech industry is now pushing its influence at the state level, San Francisco has already experienced many of these same tactics at the city level. Backed with Silicon Valley money, several different 501(c)(4) groups formed over the past couple election cycles to throw support behind preferred mayoral and board of supervisor candidates. They also bankrolled successful recall campaigns for a progressive district attorney and members of the school board.\n\nThe California governor’s race has been a crowded field without notable frontrunners. Newsom had been a long-time friend of the tech industry, hosting Google’s Page and Brin as guests at his wedding and referring to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff as “family”. His departure appears to have Silicon Valley fretting.\n\nSingleton, from the Chamber of Progress, said Newsom had long recognized “how pivotal the technology industry is in California”.\n\nBut then, late last month, Mahan, a moderate Democrat and the mayor of San Jose, announced his candidacy. Before Mahan got involved in politics in 2020, he had a career in the tech sector. He was an undergraduate at Harvard with Zuckerberg, and in 2014 co-founded a startup with funding from Conway, Benioff and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.\n\nMahan appears to be the savior the tech industry had been searching for. Since his candidacy announcement just two weeks ago, millions have poured into his campaign. According to public records, he’s received donations from several venture capitalists, along with Roblox CEO David Baszucki, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Cloudkitchen co-founder Diego Berdakin, and Ring founder Siminoff.\n\nMahan has even courted donors who helped launch companies known for working with the Trump administration, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Matt Grimm and his wife Kimberly Grimm, according to public records.\n\nGoogle’s Brin has also backed Mahan, maxing out the limit for an individual campaign donation at $78,400. Several of Mahan’s other tech backers also maxed out their donations. At this point, Mahan has now raised more than double the two most prominent democrats in the race, Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.\n\nAs political races and ballot measure campaigns continue to heat up across California in 2026, tech’s influence is only expected to grow.\n\n“It’s going to be a fun session,” Singleton said. That’s for sure.”",

    "fullText": "California’s two-year crackdown on organized retail theft resulted in 29,060 arrests and $226 million in recovered stolen goods as of September 2025.\n\nReinforced by a historic $267 million investment, local agencies and district attorneys have referred nearly 23,000 cases for prosecution.\n\nRecent data highlights a nearly 19% increase in recovered property over the last quarter, totaling $36 million in assets returned to businesses.\n\nSACRAMENTO - Governor Gavin Newsom announced Friday that California’s sustained investment in disrupting criminal networks has led to over 29,000 arrests for organized retail theft over the past two years.\n\nSupported by the largest public safety investment in state history, local law enforcement agencies are utilizing new technology and increased staffing to dismantle sophisticated theft rings.\n\nBetween October 2023 and September 2025, state-funded operations led to 29,060 arrests and the referral of 22,896 cases for prosecution, according to a statement put out by Newsom's office.\n\nCentral to this effort is a $267 million grant package distributed to 55 communities through the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC).\n\nSUGGESTED: Newsom touts 'Jobs First' program in Orange County, highlighting job growth\n\nThis funding has enabled 38 law enforcement agencies to purchase advanced equipment and 13 district attorney's offices to implement \"vertical prosecution\" programs, where a single prosecutor handles a case from start to finish.\n\nIn the most recent quarter (July–September 2025), officers recovered nearly $36 million in stolen goods. This surge contributed to a total of $226 million in recovered property since the program's inception—an increase of nearly 19% in just three months.\n\n2019: Governor Newsom establishes the CHP Organized Retail Crime Task Force.\n\n2023: California announces the largest-ever investment to combat organized retail crime as part of the Public Safety Plan.\n\nOctober 2023: BSCC begins distributing $267 million in grants to local communities.\n\nAugust 2024: Newsom signs a landmark bipartisan legislative package to strengthen penalties for property crimes and \"smash-and-grab\" robberies.\n\nSeptember 2025: Reporting period concludes with a record $226 million in goods recovered and over 29,000 arrests.\n\n\"We are sending a clear message: organized retail crime has no place in our communities,\" said Newsom.\n\n\"Through strong partnerships with local law enforcement, we are disrupting criminal enterprises, protecting small businesses, and making sure those responsible face consequences for their actions.\"\n\nSUGGESTED: Newsom, Dr. Oz feud intensifies over Armenian 'mafia' hospice fraud claims in Los Angeles\n\nBSCC Board Chair Linda Penner added, \"The ORT grants are providing local law enforcement the tools necessary to strategically dismantle retail crime networks. With thousands of arrests and millions of dollars in recovered goods, we are successfully building a more secure environment for California’s businesses and residents alike.\"\n\nThe state expects the number of convictions to continue rising as vertical prosecution teams clear backlogged cases.\n\nThe 2024 bipartisan legislation provides new tools for the next phase of enforcement, allowing for the aggregation of stolen goods across different victims and counties to meet felony thresholds.\n\nSUGGESTED: 100-foot tunnel entrance leads CHP to hidden bunker, 10,000-round weapons cache\n\nMeanwhile, the California Highway Patrol’s task force remains active, having already conducted over 4,300 investigations since 2019.\n\nSmall business owners and residents can stay informed on local public safety initiatives by visiting the BSCC website to view grant progress summaries and maps.\n\nSuspicious activity or organized retail theft should be reported directly to local law enforcement or through the CHP’s Organized Retail Theft reporting portal.\n\nThe information in this report is based on official statements and data released by the Office of Governor Gavin Newsom and the California Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC).",

Snow levels will initially sit around 6,500 feet but are expected to tumble as colder air moves in.\n\nA second storm is slated for Tuesday into Wednesday, followed by a third on Thursday.\n\nFriday – Sunday: Mild warming trend with peak temperatures on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nSunday Night: The first storm system reaches the Central Coast.\n\nMonday: Widespread heavy rain and the start of the \"wettest\" period of the week.\n\nTuesday – Wednesday: The second storm arrives; snow levels begin to drop significantly.\n\nThursday: A third system may impact the region, though moisture levels are unconfirmed.\n\nWhile the timing for the first storm is relatively certain, the NWS notes that \"it’s always difficult to time these features 4 or more days out,\" particularly regarding the exact end of the second system.\n\nWhile debris flows are a major concern, the precise locations of the most intense rain rates within burn scars remain difficult to pinpoint until the storm is closer.\n\nSnow levels are expected to undergo a dramatic change as the week progresses.\n\nWhile the snow level will start near 6,000 feet on Monday, it is forecast to fall to between 3,000 and 3,500 feet by Wednesday.\n\nThis could lead to significant snowfall in lower mountain passes and potentially hazardous driving conditions.\n\nClear drainage: Ensure gutters and storm drains are clear of debris to prevent localized flooding.\n\nMonitor burn scars: Residents near recent burn areas should stay alert for weather updates and be prepared to evacuate if debris flow warnings are issued.\n\nAvoid the surf: Stay away from rock jetties and the water, as large breaking waves and dangerous rip currents are expected.\n\nPrep for snow: If traveling through mountain passes Tuesday or Wednesday, carry tire chains and an emergency kit.\n\nThis report is based on information from the National Weather Service.",

    "fullText": "Police shut down DD Café in Garden Grove, Calif. after \"complaints of illegal activity\"\n\nSeventeen people, including the business owners, were arrested on Feb. 5\n\nThe arrests come days after a TikTok user described DD Café as a \"strip club\" in a viral video about the business\n\nPolice shut down a California café reportedly known for its bikini-clad employees after “complaints of illegal activity” and a viral TikTok describing it as a “strip club.”\n\nSeventeen people were arrested at DD Café on Thursday, Feb. 5 following a police investigation into the Garden Grove, Calif. establishment, the Garden Grove Police Department (GGPD) said in a Feb. 5 news release.\n\nThe department’s Special Investigations Unit conducted the investigation into DD Café “following complaints of illegal activity occurring inside the business,” the GGPD said. On Feb. 5, police served a search warrant at the establishment. Gang suppression officers were on the scene, according to the release.\n\nThe GGPD’s Sgt. Nick Jensen told The Orange County Register that police found DD Café employees serving customers while clad in bikinis, as well as in what the newspaper described as “various states of undress.”\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the business was operating as a “bikini cafe.” The Yelp page for the business shows photos of employees in bikinis, and lists it in business categories for “coffee & tea,” “juice bars & smoothies” and “adult entertainment.”\n\nJensen also told The Orange County Register that the business owners were among the 17 people arrested in the Feb. 5 bust.\n\nThe café violated public nudity and alcohol regulations among other Garden Grove municipal codes, the GGPD sergeant said. The business was not permitted to sell alcohol at the location, the newspaper reported, citing authorities.\n\nIn addition to the arrests, DD Café has also been red-tagged, according to police. This means the business is required to cease operations until the various violations are addressed, Jensen told The Orange County Register. The business is currently listed as closed on Google.\n\nThe owners of DD Café could not be reached for comment. A GGPD spokesperson did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.\n\nThe police investigation into and arrests comes after a video describing the Orange County establishment as a “strip club” went viral on TikTok.\n\n“So I went to a strip club today by accident, and I know what you're thinking. ‘By accident?’ No, actually, for real,” user @dosdaygirl, identified by CBS News as Paulina Abena, says in a Feb. 2 video that has amassed nearly 2 million views.\n\nAbena describes DD Café as “topless” in the TikTok, stating that she visited after searching for coffee shops in her area and finding the now-closed establishment. “They meant double D, like boobs,” she says of the business’s name. “So I walk in and everybody's naked. Quite literally, they're all naked. … I'm the only non-naked woman in the place.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nPolice have previously taken action against a “bikini café” in Garden Grove, Jensen told The Orange County Register.\n\nHe also told the newspaper that authorities believe that similar establishments are operating elsewhere in the area.",

    "description": "California's 91 Freeway uses AI cameras to catch solo HOV lane drivers, recovering $1 million in unpaid tolls through interior car photography.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-five thousand people monthly thought they were gaming the system on the 91 Express Lanes. Turns out, the house always wins — especially when it’s equipped with computer vision that can photograph your car’s interior through tinted windows. Since August 2025, Riverside County’s new Occupancy Detection System has been quietly documenting every solo driver pretending their gym bag is a passenger, recovering over $1 million in unpaid tolls and fees.\n\nThe technology reads like something from a dystopian Netflix series, except it’s scanning your morning commute. Cameras positioned at the end of the expressway capture multiple photographs of vehicle interiors. AI software flags potential violations before human reviewers at the Riverside County Transportation Commission confirm whether you actually have three people aboard. Get caught? You’ll pay the full toll plus a $5 “correction fee” — their polite term for getting busted.\n\nThis isn’t your typical red-light camera — the system spots fake passengers with unsettling accuracy.\n\nRCTC spokesperson Ariel Alcon reports catching drivers using “hats on headrests, putting items in baby car seats and even using mannequins” to fool the old enforcement system. The ODS isn’t impressed by your creativity. The technology distinguishes between actual humans and decoy passengers, even identifying properly installed car seats as legitimate occupants.\n\nConsider the scale: 400,000 cars use the 91 daily, with more than 100,000 breaking HOV rules. That’s roughly one in four drivers thinking they’re smarter than the system. Spoiler alert: they’re not.\n\nOfficials promise face-blurring and privacy compliance, but your driving habits are now permanent data.\n\nThe system protects privacy by blurring faces and storing images according to state and federal privacy laws. If you dispute a violation, you can call customer service at (800) 600-9191 or file online appeals through your 91 Express Lanes account. According to RCTC staff, most people don’t bother challenging charges once they learn about the cameras. That quiet acceptance speaks volumes about our collective resignation to surveillance infrastructure.\n\nThe 91’s success virtually guarantees expansion to other California carpool lanes. Your morning commute just became a case study in how automation transforms enforcement from occasional human oversight to constant digital monitoring. Welcome to the future — smile for the camera.\n\nFrom the coolest cars to the must-have gadgets, GadgetReview’s daily newsletter keeps you in the know. Subscribe - it’s fun, fast, and free.",

    "title": "As billionaires bail, Mark Zuckerberg doubles down on California with $50 million donation",
    "description": "The Meta founder’s donation to Sacramento State will help build “state-of-the-art STEM facilities” and a dedicated AI center.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is going all-in on AI and STEM with his philanthropic efforts. Late last year, he and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, announced they would shift the majority of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute to biomedical AI research. And late last month, the Meta founder and CEO pledged $50 million to Sacramento State University to fuel state-of-the-art STEM labs and an AI center.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled the gift on Jan. 28, tying it to a major redevelopment of three vacant state office buildings on Sacramento’s Capitol Mall into a downtown campus. The gift from Zuckerberg and Meta will fund abatement, demolition, and initial construction of the campus, enabling new student housing alongside new academic spaces, including STEM facilities and an AI center.\n\nMeta’s donation also comes at the heels of an interesting corporate and financial dynamic in California: Billionaires may soon be subject to a one-time 5% tax on their wealth. Many billionaires, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, have already moved their permanent residences out of state to avoid the tax.\n\nZuckerberg hasn’t made any public statements about the billionaires tax, and is instead doubling down on California investments and legacy.\n\n“These investments will help strengthen our communities and support the next generation of leaders and innovators,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. The Meta CEO also owns a compound of 11 properties in Palo Alto’s Crescent Park neighborhood, valued at more than $110 million. Minutes from his home, Meta has its sprawling 57-acre headquarters campus and also more than 400,000 square feet of office space nearby in Menlo Park.\n\nNewsom said Zuckerberg’s gift allows the Sacramento-based school to continue to build its talent pipeline for tech jobs.\n\nThe donation “[opens] doors for students to succeed and for our communities to prosper,” Newsom said. “Making sure students can actually afford to live where they learn is essential to that work.”\n\nWhile this recent donation comes directly from Meta and Zuckerberg, it also fits into the playbook they recently rewrote. Launched in 2015 with a pledge to give away 99% of their fortune, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has recently refocused on science, AI, and biomedical research, shifting emphasis away from its initial education and social justice priorities (although they say they’ll continue making other local donations).\n\nIn 2025, Zuckerberg and Chan laid the groundwork to recalibrate their philanthropic organization toward AI-powered biomedical research, with a particular focus on their flagship Biohub network. Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes, aims to “cure or prevent all disease,” according to Zuckerberg and Chan.",

    "description": "A federal judge on Monday blocked a California law from going into effect that would ban federal immigration agents from covering their faces, but they will still be required to wear clear identificat...",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge on Monday blocked a California law from going into effect that would ban federal immigration agents from covering their faces, but they will still be required to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to ban most law enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings under a bill that was signed in September following the summer of high-profile raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Trump administration filed a lawsuit in November challenging the laws, arguing that they would threaten the safety of officers who are facing harassment, doxing, and violence and that they violated the constitution because the state is directly regulating the federal government.\n\nJudge Christina Snyder said she issued the initial ruling because the mask ban as it was enacted did not also apply to state law enforcement authorities, discriminating against the federal government. The ruling could have national implications as states grapple with how to deal with federal agents enforcing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nIt left open the possibility to future legislation banning federal agents from wearing masks if it applied to all law enforcement agencies, with Snyder writing \"the Court finds that federal officers can perform their federal functions without wearing masks.” The ruling will go into effect Feb. 19.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill in September banning some law enforcement officers from wearing masks, neck gaiters, and other facial coverings. It was slated to go into effect Jan. 1 but was put on hold due to the lawsuit.\n\nIn addition to exempting state law enforcement officers, it made exceptions for undercover agents, protective equipment like N95 respirators or tactical gear, and other situations where not wearing a mask would jeopardize an operation. Snyder sided with the federal government, which argued this exemption was discriminatory against federal agents.\n\nNewsom also signed into law a measure requiring law enforcement to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number while on the job, which was challenged by the federal government but upheld by the judge.\n\nCalifornia State Sen. Scott Weiner, who proposed the original bill to ban facial coverings, said Monday he would immediately introduce new legislation to include state police in the law.\n\n“ICE and Border Patrol are covering their faces to maximize their terror campaign and to insulate themselves from accountability,” Weiner said in a news release. “We will ensure our mask ban can be enforced.”\n\nAt a Jan. 14 hearing, Snyder repeatedly asked the government’s lawyer, Tiberius Davis, to explain why banning masks would impede the federal law enforcement in carrying out their duties, if officers rarely wore masks prior to 2025.\n\nDavis cited claims by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that there has been a multifold increase in assaults and threats against federal officers. He also brought up an incident in Los Angeles where three women are being accused of livestreaming while following an ICE agent home and posting the address on Instagram.\n\n“There is real deterrence on the officer’s safety and ability to perform their duties,” Davis said.\n\nCameron Bell, California Department of Justice attorney, challenged his claims, saying there was no concrete evidence that federal agents can’t perform their duties without facial coverings.\n\nBell referenced declarations from U.S citizens who have been detained by federal agents but thought they were being kidnapped.\n\n“It’s obvious why these laws are in the public interest,” Bell said.\n\nThe federal government also argued in legal briefs that allowing California’s legislation could lead other states to be “emboldened to impose similar unconstitutional restraints.”\n\nDavis cited a statement from Newsom in July 2025 during an interview posted online where he discussed the mask ban bill, saying, “It appears that we don’t have the legal authority for federal agents but we do for other law enforcement authorities.”\n\nLos Angeles County supervisors voted in December to enact a local ordinance banning law enforcement from wearing masks that went into effect Jan. 8. However, the sheriff’s department said it would not enforce the ordinance until after the court ruled on the statewide mask ban. The Los Angeles Police Department had also said it wouldn’t enforce the mask ban.",

    "description": "Super Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at - this is how a thunderous evening in California panned out.",
    "fullText": "A shot at history, a delicious chance for revenge and a half-time show guaranteed to rankle the president.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at.\n\nHere's how a thunderous evening in California panned out.\n\nWhen these sides last met in the Super Bowl in 2015, Seattle had the chance to win in the final minute but chose to pass instead of run it in from one yard.\n\nPatriots safety Malcolm Butler famously intercepted and the Seahawks have been stewing on a painful defeat for 11 years.\n\nThose memories will make this comprehensive victory all the sweeter.\n\nThat Seattle team was characterised by its 'Legion of Boom' defence - immensely physical and talented athletes that dominated their opposition all over the field.\n\nThe unit that head coach Mike Macdonald and British defensive coordinator Aden Durde have put together, dubbed 'The Dark Side', has arguably eclipsed even that legendary group.\n\nKeeping the Patriots scoreless for three quarters looked almost humane compared with how they responded when their opponents showed some signs of life.\n\nFollowing New England finally getting a touchdown, the Seahawks intercepted on the next play to kill momentum. Then, on the following drive, Devon Witherspoon forced quarterback Drake Maye into a fumble that led to a defensive touchdown.\n\nWith the third youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl and the prospect of a potential franchise sale for billions of dollars, the future looks bright for the Seahawks.\n\nWhile the defence was dominant, and Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker was delivering the best rushing numbers in the event for 28 years, quarterback Sam Darnold was quietly putting together his own effective game.\n\nDrafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold's career plummeted, the nadir a game against the Patriots where he admitted to \"seeing ghosts\" in the face of their pressure.\n\nDiscarded by the Jets and the Carolina Panthers, he was back-up in San Francisco before getting a chance at the Minnesota Vikings. He led them to a 14-3 record last season only to be let go again when they faltered in the play-offs.\n\nPicked up in free agency, and supported by a decent offensive line, Darnold has again proved his talent this season and here, he quietly accumulated yards and avoided turnovers - previously the bane of his career.\n\nForgotten by some, written off by most, Darnold's rise to Super Bowl victory is perhaps the most satisfying storyline of this NFL season.\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to claim second Super Bowl\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nFor 20 years, the New England Patriots were the dominant force in the NFL, under the tutelage of Bill Belichick and on the arm of the league's most decorated quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nSix-time champions, they sought to go clear of the Pittsburgh Steelers by making it seven in Santa Clara.\n\nMerely being in this event was a remarkable achievement after back-to-back four-win seasons. Former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel took the reins last summer and has inspired a dramatic turnaround.\n\nKey to that has been the stellar play of sophomore quarterback Maye, who finished a narrow runner-up in the vote for regular season Most Valuable Player to Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHoping to make history as the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, Maye was hit six times and instead collected an undesirable record - his 21 sacks in the post-season the worst in NFL history.\n\nAfter only putting up 78 yards of offence through three quarters, he at least found some juice in the final quarter, throwing touchdowns to Mack Hollins and Rhamondre Stevenson.\n\nBut those late scores papered over the cracks as the Patriots were well beaten, and their bid for history put on hold for at least one more year.\n\nAmid protests and scrutiny over the tactics of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the choices for entertainment at the Super Bowl were not well received in the White House.\n\nWhen Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act in September, right-wing media circles noted he had criticised the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe subsequent decision to give vocal Trump critics Green Day a slot in the pre-game entertainment went down equally well.\n\nLast week, when Bad Bunny picked up his Grammy for Album of the Year, he began his acceptance speech with the words: \"ICE out.\"\n\nIt prompted one conservative group to organise an alternative half-time show, fronted by Trump ally Kid Rock and the president to label the selection \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\nOn the way in, anti-ICE protestors offered towels bearing political messaging to Super Bowl supporters.\n\nBad Bunny's unapologetically Latino set, performed across a temporary jungle in the middle of Levi's Stadium, did not douse Republican ire but provided plenty of entertainment for the 70,000 fans.\n\nThe most-streamed artist of 2025 was all bouncing energy, flanked by a myriad of dancers and through a whirlwind of movement and rapid lyrics, he became the first performer to conduct the half-time show fully in Spanish.\n\nThere was time to squeeze in some special guests, including compatriot Ricky Martin and pop royalty Lady Gaga, who performed an extract from her song 'Die With A Smile'. In English.\n\nFinally, as fireworks signalled the end of a high-octane set, Bad Bunny brandished the football he had been carrying to show the words 'Together, we are America', before disappearing from the field.\n\nPresident Trump, who became the first incumbent to attend the Super Bowl last year in New Orleans, was not there in person but labelled the show \"an affront to America\" and \"a slap in the face to our country\".\n\nThe Super Bowl is a magnet for celebrity guests and few are bigger than rock icon Jon Bon Jovi, who introduced the New England Patriots to the crowd before the game.\n\nOn the other side, Hollywood actor Chris Pratt did likewise for his beloved Seahawks, while actors Macauley Culkin and Jessica Alba were among those in attendance.\n\nThey were joined in the stands by rappers Jay-Z and Travis Scott, as well as Cardi B, in town to support boyfriend and Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs - and do some dancing alongside Bad Bunny.\n\nAs for sports stars, tennis legend Roger Federer and seven-time world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also watched on from the galleries.\n\nFinally, decorated quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Joe Montana joined Brady for the ceremonial coin toss.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Seattle Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III was named Super Bowl LX Most Valuable Player after rushing for 135 yards and helping Seattle to a 29–13 victory over the New England Patriots in Santa Clara, California. Walker became the first running back since Terrell Davis in 1998 to win Super Bowl MVP, a rare honor in today’s quarterback-driven NFL.\n\nIn his post-game interview, Walker described the achievement as almost unbelievable, saying it was “just a dream come true” because many players never even reach the Super Bowl, let alone win MVP.\n\nBut beyond the individual accolade, Walker highlighted the adversities the Seahawks overcame this season:\n\nHe thanked his teammates and emphasized the team’s resilience, noting, “We went through a lot of adversity this season, but we came together, and we stuck together, and this is what we got.”\n\nWalker shouldered a heavier workload down the stretch after Seattle’s offense lost running back Zach Charbonnet to a torn ACL in the playoffs, proving his ability to lead even through tough circumstances.\n\nWalker’s MVP performance not only helped deliver a Super Bowl title but also snapped a decades-long drought for running backs winning the MVP award, underscoring both how well he played and how meaningful the achievement was for his position.\n\nThe post Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III Recalls Seahawks’ Adversities After Winning What Saquon Barkley Couldn’t Last Year appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "A shot at history, a delicious chance for revenge and a half-time show guaranteed to rankle the president.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at.\n\nHere's how a thunderous evening in California panned out.\n\nWhen these sides last met in the Super Bowl in 2015, Seattle had the chance to win in the final minute but chose to pass instead of run it in from one yard.\n\nPatriots safety Malcolm Butler famously intercepted and the Seahawks have been stewing on a painful defeat for 11 years.\n\nThose memories will make this comprehensive victory all the sweeter.\n\nThat Seattle team was characterised by its 'Legion of Boom' defence - immensely physical and talented athletes that dominated their opposition all over the field.\n\nThe unit that head coach Mike Macdonald and British defensive coordinator Aden Durde have put together, dubbed 'The Dark Side', has arguably eclipsed even that legendary group.\n\nKeeping the Patriots scoreless for three quarters looked almost humane compared with how they responded when their opponents showed some signs of life.\n\nFollowing New England finally getting a touchdown, the Seahawks intercepted on the next play to kill momentum. Then, on the following drive, Devon Witherspoon forced quarterback Drake Maye into a fumble that led to a defensive touchdown.\n\nWith the third youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl and the prospect of a potential franchise sale for billions of dollars, the future looks bright for the Seahawks.\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to claim second Super Bowl\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nWhile the defence was dominant, and Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker was delivering the best rushing numbers in the event for 28 years, quarterback Sam Darnold was quietly putting together his own effective game.\n\nDrafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold's career plummeted, the nadir a game against the Patriots where he admitted to \"seeing ghosts\" in the face of their pressure.\n\nDiscarded by the Jets and the Carolina Panthers, he was back-up in San Francisco before getting a chance at the Minnesota Vikings. He led them to a 14-3 record last season only to be let go again when they faltered in the play-offs.\n\nPicked up in free agency, and supported by a decent offensive line, Darnold has again proved his talent this season and here, he quietly accumulated yards and avoided turnovers - previously the bane of his career.\n\nForgotten by some, written off by most, Darnold's rise to Super Bowl victory is perhaps the most satisfying storyline of this NFL season.\n\nFor 20 years, the New England Patriots were the dominant force in the NFL, under the tutelage of Bill Belichick and on the arm of the league's most decorated quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nSix-time champions, they sought to go clear of the Pittsburgh Steelers by making it seven in Santa Clara.\n\nMerely being in this event was a remarkable achievement after back-to-back four-win seasons. Former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel took the reins last summer and has inspired a dramatic turnaround.\n\nKey to that has been the stellar play of sophomore quarterback Maye, who finished a narrow runner-up in the vote for regular season Most Valuable Player to Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHoping to make history as the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, Maye was hit six times and instead collected an undesirable record - his 21 sacks in the post-season the worst in NFL history.\n\nAfter only putting up 78 yards of offence through three quarters, he at least found some juice in the final quarter, throwing touchdowns to Mack Hollins and Rhamondre Stevenson.\n\nBut those late scores papered over the cracks as the Patriots were well beaten, and their bid for history put on hold for at least one more year.\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAmid protests and scrutiny over the tactics of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the choices for entertainment at the Super Bowl were not well received in the White House.\n\nWhen Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act in September, right-wing media circles noted he had criticised the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe subsequent decision to give vocal Trump critics Green Day a slot in the pre-game entertainment went down equally well.\n\nLast week, when Bad Bunny picked up his Grammy for Album of the Year, he began his acceptance speech with the words: \"ICE out.\"\n\nIt prompted one conservative group to organise an alternative half-time show, fronted by Trump ally Kid Rock and the president to label the selection \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\nOn the way in, anti-ICE protestors offered towels bearing political messaging to Super Bowl supporters.\n\nBad Bunny's unapologetically Latino set, performed across a temporary jungle in the middle of Levi's Stadium, did not douse Republican ire but provided plenty of entertainment for the 70,000 fans.\n\nThe most-streamed artist of 2025 was all bouncing energy, flanked by a myriad of dancers and through a whirlwind of movement and rapid lyrics, he became the first performer to conduct the half-time show fully in Spanish.\n\nThere was time to squeeze in some special guests, including compatriot Ricky Martin and pop royalty Lady Gaga, who performed an extract from her song 'Die With A Smile'. In English.\n\nFinally, as fireworks signalled the end of a high-octane set, Bad Bunny brandished the football he had been carrying to show the words 'Together, we are America', before disappearing from the field.\n\nPresident Trump, who became the first incumbent to attend the Super Bowl last year in New Orleans, was not there in person but labelled the show \"an affront to America\" and \"a slap in the face to our country\".\n\nBad Bunny piles on Puerto Rican patriotism at Super Bowl half-time show\n\nWhat is ICE and what powers do its agents have to use force?\n\nThe Super Bowl is a magnet for celebrity guests and few are bigger than rock icon Jon Bon Jovi, who introduced the New England Patriots to the crowd before the game.\n\nOn the other side, Hollywood actor Chris Pratt did likewise for his beloved Seahawks, while actors Macauley Culkin and Jessica Alba were among those in attendance.\n\nThey were joined in the stands by rappers Jay-Z and Travis Scott, as well as Cardi B, in town to support boyfriend and Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs - and do some dancing alongside Bad Bunny.\n\nAs for sports stars, tennis legend Roger Federer and seven-time world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also watched on from the galleries.\n\nFinally, decorated quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Joe Montana joined Brady for the ceremonial coin toss.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Arizona’s first season in the Big 12 Conference was an eye opener, both in terms of the significant bump in competition from the Pac-12 and the hostile atmospheres it entered. No more trips to half-empty gyms in Corvallis or Pullman, or ones in California with nearly as many UA fans as ones for the home team.\n\nTrips to Lubbock, Manhattan, Ames and Lawrence all ended badly. The opponent had a lot to do with that, but so did the crowds. All four games were sellouts, the atmospheres electric.\n\nThe second time around has been much better for Arizona (23-0, 10-0) on the road in the Big 12. It’s won at Utah, TCU, UCF, BYU and ASU, in addition to a nonconference win at UConn in November, the six consecutive road wins the longest in-season streak since 2016-17.\n\nBut now comes a trip to the last road venue that the UA lost in, Kansas’ Allen Fieldhouse. The Wildcats fell 83-76 in Lawrence to end the 2024-25 regular season, keeping Jayhawks coach Bill Self perfect on Senior Day.\n\nSelf, who is in his 23rd season at Kansas, has also never lost at home on Big Monday. He’s 38-0 , with the Jayhawks’ last Big 12 home loss on a Monday coming in 2001.\n\nBut Kansas (18-5, 8-2) has also never beaten a No. 1 team at Allen Fieldhouse, going 0-5 in such opportunities. The last was in 2003, when top-ranked Arizona came to town and won 91-74.\n\n“It’s going to be an awesome atmosphere,” UA coach Tommy Lloyd said. “And I just have a feeling those Jayhawk fans are going to be out for blood. So you know what? We’re here for it.”\n\nArizona is a 2.5-point favorite, per FanDuel Sportsbook, and if that holds it would be just the sixth time Kansas has been a home underdog since 1996.\n\nHere’s what to watch for when the UA and KU meet on Monday night:\n\nDepending on which expert you listen to, or which sportsbook you check out, the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft is probably going to be one of two freshmen from the Big 12. Arizona has already faced BYU wing AJ Dybantsa, now it gets a crack at Kansas guard Darryn Peterson.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Peterson is averaging 20.5 points per game, 21.1 in Big 12 play, and makes 41.7 percent of his 3-point shots. He has scored in double figures every time out, going for 18 in 20 minutes against BYU and nailing the tying and winning 3s in the final 1:20 of a win at Texas Tech last week.\n\nBut Peterson has also missed quite a bit of time due to injury. He’s sat out 10 games, nine during nonconference play, did not play at Kansas State on Jan. 24 and a week later didn’t play the second half against BYU because of cramping.\n\nThe last two games, at Texas Tech and vs. Utah, saw him play 30-plus minutes but also post two of his lowest offensive ratings of the season.\n\nLike BYU, Kansas isn’t just its potential No. 1 pick. Three other Jayhawks average more than 14 points in Big 12 games, with guard Melvin Council dropping 36 at NC State in December scoring 22 in an OT win over TCU last month that saw his team rally from down 15 with less than five minutes to go.\n\nKansas also has the top shot blocker in the conference in 6-foot-10 sophomore Flory Bidunga. Bidunga has swatted 65 shots this season, averaging 3.8 in Big 12 play with seven against Utah on Saturday, and is shooting 78.5 percent in conference action.\n\nDepth could be an issue for Kansas, though. Only two bench players average double figures in minutes and guard Elmarko Jackson missed the last game. Self has said Jackson will play against Arizona but may not be 100 percent.\n\nBidunga and starting center Bryson Tiller, a 6-11 freshman, have been good at avoiding foul trouble but if they do get whistled there’s not much behind them to eat minutes.\n\nArizona has outrebounded every opponent this season, finishing plus-20 against Oklahoma State last time out, and is limiting Big 12 foes to boards on 25.6 percent of their misses. That’s tops in the conference, while Kansas is the worst offensive rebounding team in the league.\n\nKansas got 42 of its 71 points against Utah in the paint but also gave up 32 (of 57). The Jayhawks are +6.4 in paint points for the season, +8 in Big 12 games. Arizona, which won the paint battle 54-14 against Oklahoma State, is +19.2 in conference play.\n\nArizona may need to attempt a few more 3-pointers in this one, though, as Kansas is third-best in the Big 12 in 2-point defense. Bidunga’s shot blocking has a lot to do with that.\n\nBrayden Burries was Arizona’s leading scorer for the seventh time, fourth in Big 12 play, but for the 12th time this season the Wildcats had at least five players in double figures. Every member of the 8-man rotation has either led or tied for the lead in scoring in a game, with five different guys doing that in conference games.\n\n“I just feel like our versatility, and we know how deep we are,” Jaden Bradley said when asked about the key to Arizona’s unbeaten start. “It can be anybody’s night, the bigs, the guards, and I feel like everybody’s happy for one another. And I feel like that’s special. You don’t see that too often.”\n\nKansas could have a front row seat for another Bradley masterclass, which he’s mostly saved for ranked foes. The senior guard is averaging 19.7 points in Arizona’s six games against ranked teams, shooting 56.9 percent, and 18.8 points in Big 12 road contests.",

    "fullText": "Sam Darnold has been facing challenges all throughout his time playing football since his days at San Clemente (Calif.). Now the former California high school football star will get his chance on the grandest stage of them all, Super Bowl LX, to show why he’s one of the best to have ever come out of the Golden State.\n\nThrough Darnold’s sophomore and junior seasons with the Tritons, the Super Bowl starting quarterback had seen minimal time on the field at San Clemente, totaling 748 yards and seven touchdowns. It would be Darnold’s senior year where the signal caller would blossom into his own before heading off to become a USC Trojan.\n\nDuring his senior campaign with the Tritons, Darnold had himself a strong season and ended up completing 213-of-314 passes for 2,985 yards and 39 touchdowns. The four-star prospect showed off his wheels on the ground, rushing for 785 yards and 13 touchdowns.\n\nAfter his high school playing days at San Clemente, Darnold was already committed to USC, making his decision during the summer of 2014 heading into his senior season and would head into a crowded quarterback room with the Trojans.\n\nPlaying two seasons at USC with a redshirt freshman campaign, the 6-foot-3, 221-pound passer completing 549-of-846 passes for 7,229 yards and 57 touchdowns before being selected as the No. 3 pick of the 2018 NFL Draft by the New York Jets.\n\nNow heading into Sunday’s Super Bowl matchup with the six-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, Darnold has a chance one more time to prove the naysayers wrong and overcoming one more challenge in his path.\n\n“Sam Darnold was sort of a late bloomer (in high school). USC had their quarterback room all set and it was gonna go from (Cody) Kessler to Ricky Town. A lot of schools early on wanted Sam to play tight end. The issue at that time he wasn’t doing a lot of camps or 7-on-7. First time I saw him at Mission Viejo 7-on-7 tournament and he was outstanding. He made all the the grows and was superb. The way his recruitment went, he to a camp at USC and Clay Helton was the HC at the time. The staff said they had to go after him at the time after seeing him. Oregon, Duke were also after him during the recruitment him. Darnold and his dad went to a lot of USC games. I think that’s a testament to his fortitude. Is it surprising, certainly. Just knowing him and his HC. Knowing he’s a tough kid. He was walking into a very tough QB at USC and he stayed resilient.” – Rivals National Recruiting reporter Adam Gorney\n\nSan Clemente High School, located in the coastal town of San Clemente, California, serves around 3,000 students from the city and surrounding areas, including Capistrano Beach and San Juan Capistrano. Established in 1964, the school is part of the Capistrano Unified School District and boasts a robust athletics program with a strong community presence under the motto “One Town, One Team.” The Tritons are recognized for their competitive spirit across various sports disciplines.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "fullText": "Organizers in Monterey Park took inspiration from other US cities to fight against the construction of a giant datacenter\n\nWhen a southern California city council proposed building a giant datacenter the size of four football fields last December, five residents vowed to stop it.\n\nThrough a frenetic word-of-mouth campaign, the small group raised awareness about the proposed facility in Monterey Park, a small city east of Los Angeles known affectionately as the country’s first suburban Chinatown.\n\nNo Data Center Monterey Park organizers – working in tandem with the grassroots racial justice group San Gabriel Valley (SGV) Progressive Action – held a teach-in and rally that drew hundreds of participants, knocked on doors, and distributed flyers on busy streets.\n\nThey emphasized how the computer systems facility would strain the power grid, drive up energy rates and create noise pollution. A petition quickly amassed nearly 5,000 signatures. All the materials were shared in English, Chinese and Spanish – a concerted effort to reach Monterey Park’s diverse populace, which is two-thirds Asian and one-quarter Hispanic.\n\nIn just six weeks, the community won. City leaders issued a 45-day moratorium on datacenter construction and a pledge to explore a permanent ban.\n\n“It’s like the third act of an Oscar-winning movie,” said Steven Kung, a co-founder of No Data Center Monterey Park.\n\nOver the past year, homegrown revolts against datacenters have united a fractured nation, animating local board meetings from coast to coast in both farming towns and middle-class suburbs. Local communities delayed or cancelled $98bn worth of projects from late March 2025 to June 2025, according to research from the group Data Center Watch, which has been tracking opposition to the sites since 2023. More than 50 active groups across 17 states targeted 30 projects during that time period, two-thirds of which were halted.\n\nThe movement against these facilities has even made for strange bedfellows, bringing together nimbys and environmentalists in Virginia, “Stop the Steal” activists and Democratic Socialists of America organizers in Michigan.\n\n“There’s no safe space for datacenters,” said Miquel Vila, lead analyst at Data Center Watch, a research project run by AI security company 10a Labs. “Opposition is happening in very different communities.”\n\nDatacenters have exploded in states with abundant land, cheap power and generous tax breaks. Though the facilities power everything from streaming services to artificial intelligence, functioning as an engine for our digital lives, few people seem to want these sites that drain enormous amounts of water and energy, causing energy costs to soar. A November Morning Consult poll found that a majority of voters support banning datacenter construction near where they live and say “AI datacenters” are partly responsible for rising electricity prices.\n\nVila said a spike in media coverage from national outlets, particularly of protests in the north-east and midwest, had helped consolidate local campaigns against datacenters into a movement. The proliferation of the centers “has become a hot topic at a national level, which reinforces local dynamics”, Vila said.\n\nIn Indiana, a datacenter hub with more than 70 facilities, local communities are fighting another 50 projects and have halted at least a dozen in the past year, according to data from Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis-based consumer and environmental advocacy non-profit.\n\n“It’s like a revolt in the heartland,” said Bryce Gustafson, who organizes with the Citizens Action Coalition. “There’s an unbelievable amount of pushback, bipartisan and non-partisan, against these datacenters.”\n\nThe datacenter rebellion in the Republican stronghold of Indiana, he said, was built in part on a strong backlash in recent years against solar projects on farmland that many residents felt threatened the state’s rural character. The same concerns over land privatization and tech overreach carried over to the fight against datacenters, as conservatives and environmentalists joined forces to organize town halls, conduct canvassing training and file lawsuits to block developments.\n\n“For many Hoosiers, datacenters have become a physical manifestation of their mistrust of big tech, the elected officials who have embraced them, and the system that allows all this to happen,” Gustafson said.\n\nLocal fights against AI infrastructure have even begun to turn the tide at the state and federal levels as the midterms approach. In Virginia – the datacenter capital of the world with more than 600 facilities – the newly elected governor, Abigail Spanberger, campaigned on lowering utility bills by ensuring that AI companies are paying “their fair share” of electricity costs rather than passing them on to consumers. The progressive lawmakers Bernie Sanders and Rashida Tlaib have publicly backed calls for a datacenter moratorium. GOP leaders, including the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and Missouri senator Josh Hawley, have also introduced bills to regulate AI.\n\nIn Monterey Park, concerns over the proposed datacenter are primarily about its economic, environmental and public health impact. The facility would employ 14 on-site diesel generators, which researchers said produce “ambient air pollutants”, such as nitrogen oxide, that are linked to a host of respiratory illnesses, including asthma and lung cancer.\n\nOrganizer Hrag Balian said No in Data Center Monterey Park took inspiration from other communities’ organizing, including protests in Virginia and Pennsylvania that have stalled projects. “None of us had experience doing this, so seeing patterns and parallels have been tremendously helpful.”\n\nKung said a core tenet of the group’s organizing strategy was building coalitions with different community organizations in the greater San Gabriel Valley area, such as SGV Progressive Action, Asian Youth Center and Montebello Teachers Association. All these community groups mobilized their own members to show up and testify at the January city council meeting. “It’s a decentralized movement,” Kung said.\n\nAndrew Yip, a community organizer with SGV Progressive Action who helped create flyers and organize rallies, said the campaign succeeded because residents were able to put aside their differences and rally around a single cause: halting a development that would affect their livelihoods.\n\n“This is about community members rising to the occasion to look out for one another,” Yip said.\n\nFor Monterey Park organizers, the fight is far from over. Rather than gutting the proposed facility themselves, city council members are considering placing the decision before voters on the November ballot. Kung said the move would put the onus on residents to develop a “long, drawn-out awareness campaign” about datacenters for the remainder of the year. In the meantime, the organizers have continued to engage new neighbors, gather signatures for the petition, and show up at council meetings.\n\n“We won a victory, but there’s still a lot of work to do,” Kung said.",

    "description": "Nevada and Las Vegas' luxury market is booming thanks to an influx of billionaires fleeing California's proposed Billionaire Tax Act.",
    "fullText": "The most expensive condo sale in the Las Vegas area closed in early January for $21 million. If the sale of the 5,000-square-foot penthouse about 15 miles from the Las Vegas Strip had closed just a little more than a week earlier, it potentially could have saved the buyer a few hundred million dollars.\n\n\"He was looking for a while, and at the last minute, there was a little bit of a hiccup,\" real estate agent Ivan Sher told Business Insider of the sale. \"He was actually even under contract significantly before then.\"\n\nThat \"he\" is billionaire Don Hankey, the chairman of Hankey Group and a lifelong Californian worth a reported $8.2 billion.\n\nHankey is one of a handful of Californians who have decided leave the state due to the proposed Billionaire Tax Act — a bill that would subject California residents worth more than $1 billion to a one-time tax worth 5% of their assets. For someone like Hankey, that's about $410 million.\n\n\"I just felt a little bit like I wasn't wanted,\" Hankey told Forbes of why he chose to leave California.\n\nWhile Hankey may still be on the hook for the billionaire tax — the bill will be on the ballot in November 2026 and would retroactively tax individuals who were living in California on January 1, 2026 if passed — Nevada has welcomed Hankey and other high-net-worth individuals with open arms.\n\nFor the ultrawealthy ready to ditch California, but not the West Coast, Nevada offers a happy medium. With tax perks similar to Florida's — no income tax and low property taxes — Nevada is slowly becoming the next nerve center for the rich.\n\nSher, who repped Hankey's $21 million penthouse sale on both sides as the founder of real estate agency IS Luxury, said that while Las Vegas' luxury market was already heating up, the news out of California kicked it into a higher gear.\n\n\"If people were to ask me what percentage of my buyers were from California, I'd say probably about 25%, and then for the first few years after COVID, that number was closer to 80%,\" Sher said. \"As soon as that billionaire tax was proposed, the exodus began again — but at a much higher level.\"\n\nThe Las Vegas metropolitan area had about 331 millionaire households in 2019, according to RentCafe data. In 2023, that number jumped 166% to 879 households.\n\nNatalia Harris has been selling ultra-luxury real estate in the Las Vegas area for the last five years. In that time, she said the definition of \"ultra-luxury\" has changed in the Silver State.\n\n\"Back then, a home that was $10 million was 'Wow' for Vegas — that was at the top of the price point,\" Harris told Business Insider. \"Now we have three new listings that we just brought to market last week that are all between $11 million and $20 million.\"\n\nZain Aziz, the founder of technology firm Atom and one of Harris' high-net-worth clients, moved to the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, Nevada, in 2025. He said leaving the high taxes and hectic lifestyle of Silicon Valley behind was bittersweet.\n\n\"You don't really want to get punished if you do good and you create more jobs,\" Aziz said. \"I believe the Las Vegas Valley has become more and more what's synonymous with what California used to be — which was free-spirited and 'Come and achieve the impossible,'\" he added.\n\nAziz isn't the only one taking his assets elsewhere. Google cofounder Sergey Brin recently spent $42 million on a Lake Tahoe home on the Nevada side, according to Bloomberg. Larry Page, Google's other cofounder, found a tax haven on the East Coast, buying two properties totaling about $173 million in South Florida.\n\nBillionaire Larry Ellison, who owns homes across the country and the world, bought a handful of properties in Lake Tahoe near the California-Nevada border. He also recently sold his San Francisco home for $45 million in the largest sale in the area in 2025, according to the San Francisco Standard.\n\nAziz, who also moved his business to Nevada, said the culture that built California giants like Oracle and Google no longer exists there — it's budding in the next state over.\n\n\"There's no longer that innovative culture, and I believe where it exists is Vegas,\" Aziz said. \"I think that a lot of people from California who are chasing that are going to move to Vegas primarily because of the proximity to California.\"\n\nFor lifelong Californians not fully ready to leave the state's sunny weather and stellar beaches behind, Las Vegas is a less than two-hour flight to Los Angeles or San Francisco.\n\nIt also helps that certain areas of Nevada can offer a taste of home. Harris described the MacDonald Highlands neighborhood of Las Vegas, which is about 15 minutes from the Las Vegas Strip, as the Hollywood Hills of Vegas, offering stunning mountain views that give way to a sparkling cityscape beneath.\n\nFor Aziz, the developments in Nevada represent promise.\n\n\"This will become the hub for the wealthiest,\" he said. \"The city wants that.\"",

    "fullText": "The federal Small Business Administration suspended more than 111,000 California borrowers after uncovering $8.6 billion in suspected fraudulent activity linked to the COVID pandemic, SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler announced Friday.\n\n\"We have suspended nearly 112,000 borrowers tied to at least $9 billion in suspected fraud,\" Loeffler said in a press release on Friday. \"This staggering number represents the most significant crack-down on those who defrauded pandemic programs, and it illuminates the scale of corruption that the Biden Administration tolerated for years.\"\n\nThe SBA reported that all in, it suspended 111,620 California borrowers who received 118,489 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) loans, totaling $8.6 billion.\n\nThe Border Gets The Attention While Fraudulent Government Benefits Bleed Taxpayers Dry\n\nPPP loans were a COVID-era federal relief program that gave small businesses money to keep workers on the payroll, while EIDL loans are part of an SBA program that provides low-interest disaster relief loans to help businesses survive during times of diaster, including the pandemic.\n\n\"Once again, the Trump SBA is taking decisive action to deliver accountability in a state whose unaccountable welfare policies have created a culture of fraud and abuse at the expense of law-abiding taxpayers and small business owners,\" Loffler continued.\n\nChildcare Expert Exposes Key Roadblock To Uncovering Potential Fraud Schemes In Minnesota: 'Really Difficult'\n\nThe announcement follows California Attorney General Rob Bonta saying on Thursday that the Trump administration was promoting \"baseless claims\" of persistent fraud in the state.\n\n\"Trump claims California is wasting money when, in reality, our programs are helping lower-income individuals and lower-income families get healthcare, food and housing assistance,\" Bonta said on Thursday.\n\n\"Trump claims, wrongly, California is perpetuating fraud when we are the victim,\" he added.\n\nBonta's office noted that California has recovered nearly $2.7 billion in various fraud schemes across the last 10 years, \"including by partnering with the federal government.\"\n\nExclusive: Senate Bill Targets Minnesota-style ‘Runaway Fraud’ To Force Scammers Repay Taxpayers\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Bonta's office on Friday for additional comment.\n\nNewsom's office directed Fox News Digital to the Governor Newsom Press Office X account, which mocked the SBA announcement.\n\n\"OMG. The Trump Administration found MAJOR FRAUD in programs THEY control, Newsom's Press Office's X account posted, linking to a New York Post exclusive on the announcement.\n\n\"The state has no role running / administering these programs.Were they hiding this??? California doesn’t hide fraud … we fight it. Nearly 1,000 arrests + over $125 billion STOPPED under @CAGovernor Gavin Newsom.\"\n\nLoeffler continued that the alleged California fraud comes after the SBA suspended 6,900 borrowers in Minnesota associated with 7,900 potentially fraudulent PPP and EIDL loans, which totaled roughly $400 million.\n\n\"As we did in Minnesota, we are actively working with federal law enforcement to identify the criminals who defrauded American taxpayers, hold them to account, and recoup the stolen funds. As we continue our state-by-state work, our message is clear: pandemic-era fraudsters will not get a pass under this Administration,\" Loeffler said, comparing California to its investigations in Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota became ground zero for welfare and social services fraud surrounding the pandemic late in 2025, when investigators uncovered sweeping fraud schemes that could top $9 billion.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "A woman in California used “an unconventional storage method” for trying to hide her unlawful catch of two abalone, an endangered species. Unfortunately for her, a wildlife officer was watching.\n\nThe unidentified poacher was with a man legally taking purple sea urchins in the intertidal zone at Van Damme State Park, located three hours north of San Francisco.\n\nA wildlife officer was observing the couple from a distance using a spotting scope, as reported by the California Department of Fish and Wildilfe.\n\nHe witnessed the woman discreetly conceal what appeared to be an abalone down her pants, “an unconventional storage method, to say the least,” the CDFW stated.\n\nAs the couple headed toward their vehicle, the wildlife officer contacted them in the parking lot to check their licenses and inspect their catch. While doing so, the wildlife officer asked the female what she had concealed.\n\nThe woman then pulled out a small abalone from inside her pants.\n\nThe wildlife officer then called for assistance from a female wildlife officer to conduct a search, suspecting she might be hiding more abalone.\n\nThen the suspect voluntarily produced a second abalone from her pants. No additional abalone were found.\n\nThe woman was cited for the illegal take of two abalone. The male was in compliance and did not possess any abalone.\n\nAn article posted in 2022 by UC Davis revealed that all species of abalone along the West Coast are listed as critically endangered or endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nMeanwhile, the bag limit for purple sea urchins is 35 individuals, according to California Department of Fish and Wildlife regulations.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Woman caught poaching endangered species, hiding them in her pants",

The mom, who’s been identified as Jacqueline Hernandez, 35, of La Habra, Calif., then stopped short, nearly causing the car behind her to rear-end her, per New York Post.\n\nA video released by police shows another car almost running over the tyke, but its driver managed to slam on the brakes just feet away from the baby.\n\nHernandez is then seen running around to the passenger side to pick up the child.\n\nPolice were only alerted to the incident when a witness came forward and reported it. The information enabled them to identify the mother. Hernandez was then arrested on suspicion of felony child abuse, the Fullerton police said in a statement.\n\nThe toddler was injured in the fall but was expected to make a full recovery after being treated at a hospital.\n\n“Why was the baby in the front seat, and not in a car seat in the back buckled up,” asked one commenter on Instagram.\n\nUnder California law, children under 2 need to be placed in a rear-facing car seat, and until age 8, children must ride in the back seat.\n\n“This made me sick to my stomach,” another viewer commented on Instagram. “So happy the baby will make a full recovery.”\n\nSavannah Guthrie’s Brother Issues New Emotional Plea for Missing Mom as First Ransom Deadline Passes\n\nPatrick Mahomes Sr. Reportedly Remains in Jail, Could Face 10-Year Sentence for Violating Probation\n\nKaroline Leavitt ‘Can’t Guarantee’ ICE Agents ‘Won’t Be Around a Polling Location’ During Elections\n\nThis story California Woman Arrested on Felony Child Abuse After 19-Month-Old Baby Tumbles Out of SUV first appeared on National Enquirer.

    "description": "Derrick Callella of California was arrested and charged over a fake ransom demand for the mother of \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie.",
    "fullText": "A California man whom an FBI official slammed as a \"total imposter\" was arrested and charged Thursday over allegations that he sent a fake ransom demand for Nancy Guthrie, the mother of \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie.\n\n\"Did you get the bitcoin were [sic] waiting on our end for the transaction,\" Derrick Callella texted two family members of Nancy Guthrie on Wednesday, following reports of a ransom demand tied to the elderly woman's disappearance that listed a Bitcoin wallet address, his criminal complaint said.\n\nThe complaint, filed in Arizona federal court, said Callella admitted to sending the messages. It was not immediately clear whether Callella had retained an attorney.\n\nAuthorities believe the 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie was taken from her ranch-style home just outside Tucson, Arizona, in the Catalina Foothills five days ago.\n\nFBI Phoenix's special agent in charge, Heith Janke, announced the arrest on Thursday at a press conference over Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.\n\nThe FBI official said the arrest was related to an \"imposter ransom demand\" for the woman. \"It was someone that was trying to profit from it — a total imposter,\" Janke said.\n\nJanke also issued a message to anyone involved in Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, urging them to \"do the right thing.\"\n\n\"This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her well-being,\" Janke said.\n\nThe FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the recovery of Nancy Guthrie or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance, Janke announced.\n\nAuthorities said that an additional ransom letter regarding Nancy Guthrie, sent to local and national media outlets, is being taken \"seriously.\"\n\nThat note made a monetary \"demand\" for 5 p.m. local time Thursday, said Janke.\n\n\"If a transfer wasn't made, then I think a second demand was for next Monday,\" Janke said, declining to provide other specifics.\n\nAn Apple Watch and a floodlight were also mentioned in ransom letters, Janke said.\n\n\"We're not going to go into specifics. It's very important that we keep this investigation moving forward, and we don't want to put more facts out there that others then can use to try to profit from this,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities revealed new details around the timeline of Nancy Guthrie's disappearance on Thursday and confirmed that the blood discovered on the elderly woman's porch belonged to her.\n\nNancy Guthrie was dropped off at her home by her family just before 10 p.m. on January 31. At 1:47 a.m. MST the next day, the woman's doorbell camera disconnected, police said.\n\nAt 2:12 a.m., the doorbell software detected a person on the camera, but there was no available video footage, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said during the Thursday press conference. Minutes later, Nancy Guthrie's pacemaker app showed a disconnect from her phone.\n\nHer family checked in on her at 11:56 a.m. and called 911 shortly after, police said.\n\nNanos said that Nancy Guthrie's doorbell camera had also been removed. No suspects or persons of interest have yet been identified in the case, the sheriff said.\n\nOn Wednesday, in an emotional video post alongside her siblings, Savannah Guthrie pleaded to her mother's possible abductors to \"please reach out to us.\"\n\n\"We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk,\" the famed NBC anchor said, adding, \"We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.\"\n\nNancy Guthrie suffers from physical ailments and requires daily medications that, if not taken every 24 hours, could have life-threatening consequences.\n\n\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" Nanos said.",

    "fullText": "A jaw-dropping video captured the traumatic moment a 12-year-old girl plunged to the ground after dangling momentarily from a ski chairlift in California.\n\nThe frightening incident happened Saturday at Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort, where the visiting snowboarder appeared to be unsecured on the chairlift.\n\nIn a video that went viral on social media, the girl appeared to grip the chairlift in a desperate struggle as her feet flailed in the air, still strapped to her snowboard.\n\nSeveral mountain staff members were then seen rushing over to help, placing padding and a safety net below in an attempt to catch her fall.\n\nSkydiver Survives After Reserve Parachute Accidentally Deploys, Leaving Him Dangling From Flying Airplane\n\nThe girl then crashed to the ground, tragically missing most of the safety net, according to the footage. Rescuers appeared briefly in shock before scrambling over in alarm.\n\nA woman claiming to be the girl’s mother commented on the post, saying her daughter \"miraculously walked away with no broken bones or major injuries.\"\n\n\"As the mother of my 12 yo daughter that fell today I really want to thank everyone who came out to help her,\" she said. \"The mammoth team did their best to get to her as quickly as possible. It was an incredibly traumatic experience and everyone supported us.\"\n\nColorado Jury Awards Family $205M After 6-Year-old Falls To Death From Theme Park Ride\n\nAddressing questions about why the chair’s safety bar was not lowered, the mother emphasized that no one was at fault. She indicated that the chair slipped almost immediately after her daughter got on, leaving no time to secure it.\n\n\"As to the bar - we had no chance,\" she added. \"She slipped down right away. There was nothing that anyone did wrong. It was a series of small choices that happened quickly that led to a fluke accident.\"\n\nIn the video, the girl appears to be sitting next to two other people before falling. According to her mother, the group held onto her as long as possible, which gave rescuers time to respond.\n\n\"As a mother I know it is my job to protect my child,\" she said. \"We held on as long as we could. Long enough to have people get into position to allow her to walk away.\"\n\nDespite the traumatic experience, she said the family will not be deterred from skiing and \"will be riding again when she’s ready.\"\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "A discussion about California Governor Gavin Newsom’s presidential prospects ended with Jessica Tarlov telling Jesse Watters, “You’re gross.”\n\nOn Wednesday’s installment of The Five on Fox News, Tarlov said Newsom’s opponents will attempt to use California as a cudgel to try to derail his aspirations.\n\n“There’s push and pull, but this is what the debate is going to be,” she said. “Like when he was up there with Ron DeSantis when they did that debate with Sean Hannity and, they went California v. Florida. And when you come from a coastal state, especially one as big as California, and they definitely had some bad years. We covered a lot of poop on the sidewalks in San Francisco and things like that. It’s going to be tough in a Democratic Primary. But he’s not afraid of the challenge. And Democrats are looking for someone at this moment who will stand up and fight. And he is ready to do that.”\n\nWatters responded by questioning whether Newsom’s identity as a straight white man will pose an issue in 2028. Co-host Greg Gutfeld also jumped in and helped send the segment off the rails:\n\nWATTERS: And he’s a straight white man. Is that gonna be a problem, Jessica?TARLOV: I am very into straight white men myself. I married one. So, I think it’s gonna be fine.WATTERS: Ok.GUTFELD: How dare you.TARLOV: What? Him or me?GUTFELD: You are now into straight white men?TARLOV: Not exclusively. I like everybody, I guess, but I married one.GUTFELD: Ok.WATTERS: Is he Christian?TARLOV: Brian was raised Catholic.WATTERS: Ok, just checking. Just wanna make sure we check all the boxes.TARLOV: Also, all religions are good and fine.GUTFELD: All of them?WATTERS: I like it on the record here. Even Islam?TARLOV: Get out. You’re really gross.WATTERS: I’m just kidding. We love Muslims.\n\nThe post ‘You’re Really Gross’: Jessica Tarlov Disgusted by Jesse Watters’ Questions About Her Dating Preferences first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump will not be attending the Super Bowl after being warned he would likely be resoundingly booed by the crowd inside the stadium, according to a report.\n\nThe thin-skinned president had previously offered the unlikely excuse that he would not attend the NFL championship game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots on Sunday in Santa Clara, California, because it was “too far away” and because he disliked the planned performers, Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\nHowever, several of Trump’s advisers have now told Zeteo that the 79-year-old was urged not to attend the game in the deep-blue Democratic state because he would likely receive a less-than-friendly reception.\n\nClips of Trump being loudly booed in front of tens of thousands of spectators—and potentially more than 100 million viewers at home—going viral would be “another thing we don’t want right now,” one Trump adviser told Zeteo.\n\nTrump was met with a mixture of boos and cheers when he attended last year’s Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nBut since then his approval ratings have plummeted across the board, with the president losing support over his handling of the economy and his hardline immigration policies, particularly in the wake of the killing of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n\nTrump’s dire polling numbers, combined with the Super Bowl being held in a state that has overwhelmingly rejected him in the past three presidential elections, led one aide to conclude it was “best to stay away from this one.”\n\n“Whatever [the crowd’s makeup] ends up being, it’s not gonna be a Turning Point USA speech,” the aide said.\n\nTrump told the New York Post last month that he would skip this year’s Super Bowl because he was unhappy that Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny would be performing the halftime show. Veteran punk rockers Green Day, who are also vocal critics of the president, are performing at the Super Bowl opening ceremony.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nTurning Point USA announced that MAGA country singer Kid Rock will headline its “All American Halftime Show,” scheduled to take place at the same time as the official halftime performance from Latin superstar Bad Bunny, who predominantly sings in Spanish.\n\nTrump also offered the dubious explanation that he was unwilling to travel to California because it was “just too far away,” despite regularly flying around the world and having attended last year’s Super Bowl in New Orleans.\n\nHe told the New York Post that he would be welcomed by the crowd if he dared to go. “They like me,” he said.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Davis Ingle insisted that Trump would receive a warm welcome if he attended Super Bowl LX in person.\n\n“President Trump is working hard on behalf of the American people,” Ingle told Zeteo. “If he did attend the Super Bowl, he would receive a warm welcome because America knows he has done more to help this country than any other president in history.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "Halle Berry told The Cut that she never heard from California governor Gavin Newsom despite him saying they would be “reconciling” their differences over his lack of support for the Menopause Care Equity Act and his previous veto of a similar bill.\n\n“It’s disturbing when people say they’re going to do things and then they don’t,” Berry told the publication. “But he heard what I said. If he is going to run to be our next president, he can’t sleep on women. Wake up, Gavin.”\n\nHalle Berry Won an Oscar and Says 'I Was Still Black the Next Morning' With Directors Refusing to Cast Her; She Later Advised Cynthia Erivo That Oscar Wins 'Cannot Be Validation'\n\nNicki Minaj and Gavin Newsom Feud Intensifies: Rapper Doubles Down on Slamming Governor's Trans Advocacy, as He Posts Diss Track\n\nNicki Minaj Says It's 'Impossible' For Gavin Newsom to Become President in 2028: 'He Thinks He's Tom Cruise'\n\nBerry’s beef with Newsom went public last December when she spoke candidly at the New York Times DealBook Summit about Newsom’s potential presidential run. The Oscar winner declared: “With the way he’s overlooked women, half the population, by devaluing us in midlife, he probably should not be the next president.”\n\n“[If men] had a medical condition that disrupted their sleep, brain function and sex life, we’d be calling that a health crisis on par with Covid, and the whole world would shut down,” Berry added, knocking Newsom for not supporting the Menopause Care Equity Act. “When women are struggling silently through perimenopause and menopause, trying to hold their families, careers, relationships and communities together, it doesn’t just affect women, it affects every household. It affects the workplace, it affects the economy. One in six women leave the workplace due to their menopausal symptoms. So it affects everybody.”\n\nThe bill Newsom did not support would have mandated comprehensive insurance coverage for medically necessary menopause and perimenopause treatments, required doctors to complete continuing education on menopause and directed the medical board to develop a continuing education curriculum.\n\n“I need every woman in this country to fight with me,” Berry said. “But the truth is, the fight isn’t just for us women. We need men too. We need all of the leaders, every single one of you in this room – this fight needs you. We need you to stay curious. We need you to ask questions. We need you to care even when the topic feels unfamiliar and uncomfortable.”\n\nNewsom told TMZ as Berry’s takedown of him went viral that “we’re reconciling this,” but Berry told The Cut she never heard from him.\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom responded in December to Berry’s remarks, explaining his reasons for the veto by writing: “The Governor has deep admiration for Ms. Berry’s advocacy and looks forward to working with her and other stakeholders on this critical issue. He shares her goal of expanding access to menopause care that too many women struggle to get. He vetoed the bill because, as written, it would have unintentionally raised health care costs for millions of working women and working families already stretched thin — something he’s determined to avoid. We’re confident that by working together this year, we can expand access to essential menopause treatment while protecting women from higher bills.”\n\nIn regards to Berry’s latest comments to The Cut, a spokesperson for Newsom told The Independent: “Ms. Berry’s remarks are very unfortunate given the Governor’s proposal put forward to support menopause care through the state budget, just as he said he would do in his veto message on AB 432.”\n\nOscars: Original Screenplay — 'Sinners,' 'Sentimental Value' and 'Blue Moon' Gain More Popularity Among Voters\n\nWhat’s Coming to Netflix in February 2026\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in February 2026",

Musk, who is Tesla and SpaceX's CEO, launched a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman in February 2024, accusing Altman of jeopardizing its nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said that he contributed $38 million to OpenAI, thinking it would remain a nonprofit. He was one of the company's founders, along with Altman, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and others.\n\nDespite OpenAI's attorneys' attempts to have the case thrown out, a California judge said in a January hearing that there was enough evidence to go to trial, which is set for April.\n\nThe billionaire duo have been trading barbs on social media. Musk attacked OpenAI's ChatGPT on January 20, writing \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT.\" He was responding to an X post alleging that the chatbot has been linked to multiple deaths since 2022.\n\nAltman responded to Musk's post, slamming Tesla's Autopilot system as unsafe, and questioning xAI's Grok chatbot. Grok has faced criticism from governments in several countries after reports of Grok users uploading pictures of women and minors and asking the chatbot to undress them.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Altman did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

While successfully carrying 25 Starlink internet satellites to orbit, the rocket's upper stage experienced a malfunction as it prepared for a deorbit burn.\n\n\"During today’s Falcon 9 launch of @Starlink satellites, the second stage experienced an off-nominal condition during preparation for the deorbit burn,\" SpaceX said in a statement on X.. \"The vehicle then performed as designed to successfully passivate the stage. The first two MVac burns were nominal and safely deployed all 25 @Starlink satellites to their intended orbit.

    "fullText": "App endured a major outage and user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an inquiry by the California governor and an ascendant competitor\n\nA little more than one week ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The app’s time under Chinese ownership had been marked by a meteoric ascent to more than a billion users, which left incumbents such as Instagram looking like the next Myspace. But TikTok’s short new life in the US has been less than auspicious.\n\nThe day after TikTok’s arrival, its owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection, including tracking the precise locations of its users. The change was notable less for any potential invasion of privacy than for suspicion of the new owners. The updated policy falls in line with those of other major social networks. But what did these men, among them billionaire Oracle owner and Maga donor Larry Ellison, intend to do with the user data? The tweaks aroused suspicion that would blossom into paranoia just a few days later.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed the transfer of TikTok’s ownership, the US weathered two major events. A hefty, frigid snowstorm slammed the country and put about 230 million people on alert for power outages and burst pipes. And federal immigration officers killed a 37-year-old US citizen in Minneapolis during a protest, which elicited outright lies from the White House despite copious video footage. Both would knock TikTok off its feet, though in different ways.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on, which the company did not make public at the time. The app suffered severe outages as a result, according to a statement from the company. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings.\n\nSimultaneously, prominent personalities were attempting to use TikTok to express their outrage over the violent death of Alex Pretti at the hands and guns of border patrol agents. They found they could not post videos or that they received zero views. In response, many users – among them California state senator Scott Weiner, musician Billie Eilish and her brother, and comedian Meg Stalter – accused TikTok of stifling videos critical of federal immigration agents. Stalter said she would delete her account, which boasts nearly 280,000 followers. Media outlets far and wide – the New York Times, Variety, the Independent, CNN, the Washington Post – picked up their claims. Cosmopolitan magazine asked: “Is TikTok Censoring Anti-ICE Content?” The Democratic senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, tweeted that TikTok’s alleged censorship was a “threat to democracy”.\n\nAfter days of outcry online, IRL scrutiny and likely dozens of requests for clarification from the press, TikTok issued a statement blaming the problems on the snow, ice and cold on 26 January.\n\nOracle issued a statement with more detail: “Over the weekend, an Oracle datacenter experienced a temporary weather-related power outage which impacted TikTok. The challenges US TikTok users may be experiencing are the result of technical issues that followed the power outage.” It is uncommon for a physical event like a storm to wound a major site of digital life like TikTok, as such popular apps often have backups to their backups, but it can happen.\n\nThe most powerful figure to accuse TikTok of censorship was not its most famous user. The governor of California is better known for his textual presence on X than his TikToks. Nevertheless, Gavin Newsom announced on 27 January that his office would investigate whether TikTok had censored videos critical of Donald Trump, broadening the scope of alleged pro-Maga interference by the app.\n\nThe late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. An unknown number of users said they were decamping from the new American TikTok in response to its perceived censorship. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. An Upscrolled press release now claims more than a million users. As of writing, TikTok rests at No 16 in the iPhone App Store and 10th in the Google Play Store. Alongside Upscrolled in the top 10 most downloaded are three apps used to cloak online activity from surveillance, which are known as virtual private networks (VPNs). A fear of digital government incursions is in the air.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. Facebook and Instagram have withstood far graver scandals than this. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well for its future, though. The app has damaged user trust, and another misstep may inflict a more lasting injury.\n\nTikTok’s week of mayhem began with Trump. The transfer of TikTok’s ownership consummated the ban-or-sell deal the US president proposed nearly six years ago, and he said he was thrilled that that the transfer had finally taken place. In the intervening years, Trump had walked back his support for the deal; his enemy Joe Biden had supported it during his presidency; Congress had passed a law codifying Trump’s wishes and legally forcing TikTok’s sale; and the US supreme court had ratified the law in the face of a challenge by TikTok and immense popular disapproval. Then Trump ordered the immigration crackdown that set the stage for the killing of two US citizens. The only aspect of TikTok’s miserable week Trump had no hand in was the winter weather.\n\nTikTok’s disastrous arrival marks an anniversary of a similar bungled nature. One year and two weeks ago, the app stopped functioning in the US because of the same sell-or-ban law that precipitated the sale. That darkening lasted less than 24 hours. Its new owners can only hope their present problems go away just as soon.",

Coverage of the annual event will begin on ESPN at 6:30 p.m. ET, with the flag game at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nAs the NFL's top talents assemble in the Bay Area this weekend, let's meet the six Lions representatives:\n\nAfter a breakout campaign in his third NFL season out of Iowa, Campbell earned his first Pro Bowl selection and first All-Pro honor.\n\nThe former Hawkeye star led the Lions with 176 tackles (89 solo, 87 assisted), which is the second-most in the league behind Miami's Jordyn Brooks. Campbell also recorded 5 sacks, 4 passes defended, 3 forced fumbles, and 2 fumble recoveries.\n\nCampbell is also the first Lions linebacker to be selected to the Pro Bowl since Stephen Boyd's distinction in 2000.\n\nAppearing in his third Pro Bowl in his third season, Gibbs joins Barry Sanders and Billy Sims as the only running backs in team history to earn at least three Pro Bowl berths in the Super Bowl era.\n\nThis season, the former Crimson Tide icon ranked seventh league-wide in total yards, with 1,223 yards on 243 carries and 13 touchdowns, while catching 77 passes for 616 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nReplacing Seattle's Super Bowl-bound quarterback Sam Darnold, the 2025 Pro Bowl Games Offensive MVP will make his fifth Pro Bowl appearance.\n\nGoff completed 393-of-578 passes to finish second league-wide in yards (4,564) and touchdowns (34).\n\nDespite operating under a new offensive coordinator this season, he became the sixth quarterback in NFL history to produce 4,000 passing yards and 30 touchdowns in three consecutive campaigns.\n\nHutchinson earned the second Pro Bowl selection of his career after setting career highs in sacks, tackles, and forced fumbles, finishing with 14.5 sacks, 54 tackles, 14 tackles for loss, 4 forced fumbles, 3 passes defended, and 1 interception.\n\nHutchinson also led the league with 100 pressures, and his 91.9 overall grade from PFF ranked fourth among edge rushers. He became the first player in franchise history to log multiple 10.0-sack seasons through the first four years of his career.\n\nIn addition to the Pro Bowl nod, Hutchinson was named a finalist for the 2025 Associated Press Comeback Player of the Year and 2025 Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nAppearing in his fourth straight Pro Bowl in his five-year career, Penei Sewell will once again compete in the NFL's premier all-star event.\n\nHis 95.2 overall grade and 96.8 run-block grade from PFF led all offensive linemen this season, which stems from the former Oregon star allowing just one sack and six quarterback hits this year.\n\nSewell was named a finalist for the NFL's inaugural Protector of the Year Award in 2025 and joins Lou Creekmur and Lomas Brown as the only Lions tackles to earn at least four Pro Bowl berths in their career.\n\nSt. Brown, who has positioned himself amongst the NFL's elite wide receivers, earned his fourth straight Pro Bowl selection after recording 117 receptions for 1,401 yards and 11 touchdowns this season.\n\nThis past season, the USC product became the fourth player in NFL history to top 100 receptions and 10 touchdown receptions in three consecutive seasons.\n\nSt. Brown now joins Calvin Johnson and Herman Moore as the only wide receivers in team history to earn at least four Pro Bowl berths.\n\nFor more Lions coverage,  Follow Scout on X: @SpringgateNews\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lions Wire: Which Detroit Lions are participating in the 2026 Pro Bowl?",

In prosperous Denmark, which was all-in on petrol and diesel cars until just before Covid, sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) reached a share of 68%. In California, the share of zero-emissions vehicles hit 20%. And at least every third new car now bought by the Dutch, Finns, Belgians and Swedes burns no fuel.\n\nThese figures, which would have felt fanciful just five years ago, show the rich world leading the shift away from cars that pump out toxic gas and planet-heating pollutants. But a more startling trend is that electric car sales are also racing ahead in many developing countries. While China is known for its embrace of electric vehicles (EVs), demand has also soared in emerging markets from South America to south-east Asia. BEV sales in Turkey have caught up with the EU’s, data published this week shows.\n\nIs the electric car revolution finally entering the fast lane? Let’s take a look – after this week’s most important reads.\n\nThe Fukushima towns frozen in time: nature has thrived since the nuclear disaster but what happens if humans return?\n\nThe UK government didn’t want you to see this report on ecosystem collapse. I’m not surprised\n\nThe 16-month battle to reveal the truth about Sydney Water’s poo balls\n\nFor decades, climate progress has largely come from cleaning up the power sector. Burn gas instead of coal, or replace power plants with wind turbines or solar panels, and you can slash the amount of planet-heating gas spewed into the atmosphere for little cost.\n\nNow, early signs suggest transportation may be on the brink of delivering similar wins. EVs have quickly gained ground in markets outside Europe and North America, avoiding a rise in fuel-burning vehicles and “leapfrogging” the development path that richer countries have taken in transport.\n\n“Five years ago you might have thought [transportation] is really going to be a bottleneck [for climate progress],” says William Lamb, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “But now with the widescale adoption of EVs, it’s looking a little bit easier.”\n\nThe EV race has gone global, according to a report (pdf) published last month by Ember, a climate thinktank, which looked at BEV and plug-in hybrid sales for the first 10 months of last year. It found 39 countries around the world have an electric sales share above 10%, up from just four countries (all in Europe) in 2019. Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have overtaken the EU in their EV uptake. India, Mexico and Brazil have overtaken Japan.\n\n“It’s good news that we’re seeing growth in the EV market in more countries now,” said Robbie Andrew, a scientist who tracks electric vehicle sales at Cicero, a research centre in Oslo, the world’s EV capital. “In developing countries, this is largely about the recent arrival of much cheaper models from China. The Chinese companies have innovated extraordinarily quickly.”\n\nHalf of the cars registered in China last year were electric, and carmakers such as BYD have driven the boom in much of the global south. The Ember report found that three of the ten largest-value markets for Chinese EV exports are outside the OECD – Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia – while the value of its exports to non-OECD countries and Mexico has tripled in the last two years.\n\nThe countries that benefit range from Ethiopia, which in 2024 became the first nation to ban imports of combustion engine cars, to Nepal, a polluted country scarred by a blockade 11 years ago that left it with severe petrol shortages. But it is not just the Chinese driving progress. Turkey’s share of BEV sales hit 17% last year – the same as the EU’s – in a transition led by domestic carmaker Togg. It has overtaken Tesla as the country’s leading supplier, with BYD in third place.\n\nThe question of whether to buy an electric vehicle has also been complicated by a culture war surrounding some of the brands that make them. Tesla has seen sales plummet across Europe and the US in response to Elon Musk’s support for far-right parties, and promotion of racist conspiracy theories. But in Turkey, the brand is viewed somewhat more favourably.\n\n“If you have a Togg in Turkey, some people think you are a government-lover and a political Islamist,” says Berke Astarcioğlu, an engineer from Istanbul and an early adopter of EVs. “But if you have a Tesla, you are seen as secular, educated and open-minded.”\n\nA challenge for developing countries seeking to sustain the EV boom is whether they can build charging infrastructure fast enough to avoid customer frustration. About two-thirds of the growth in public chargers since 2020 has occurred in China, which now has about 65% of the global charging stock, a report by the International Energy Agency found last year. But charging infrastructure in many other markets is lagging behind EV adoption rates.\n\nThere are also fears the surge in EVs may taper out as the rich customer base in lower- and middle-income countries is exhausted. New cars are generally bought by wealthier residents, while others buy theirs second-hand.\n\nStill, in places like Turkey and Thailand (to name two of many), where falling prices and rising subsidies bring the price of EVs in line with petrol cars, Andrew says the question of whether only the rich can afford them falls away. “With price parity, people buy the cars because they’re simply better and cost less to run.”\n\nIf that trend continues to spread around the world, we may soon see electric cars leave their fume-belching rivals in the dust.\n\nPowering up: how Ethiopia is becoming an unlikely leader in the electric vehicle revolution\n\n‘My Tesla has become ordinary’: Turkey catches up with EU in electric car sales\n\nThe electric vehicle revolution is still on course – don’t let your loathing of Elon Musk stop you joining up",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nChicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams recently took part in a promotional unboxing, but the surprise inside was anything but ideal.\n\nThe moment took place at Canon Collectibles in Beverly Hills, California, where Williams opened a Fanatics Under Wraps Mystery Box — a product that guarantees a signed NFL jersey from a random player. Rather than pulling his own name, Williams revealed a jersey belonging to Puka Nacua, a player who played a role in ending Chicago’s season.\n\nMORE: Bears predicted to cut ties with 3-year starter in trade with Titans\n\nNacua caught five passes for 56 yards against the Bears in the divisional round, a game Chicago lost to the Los Angeles Rams in overtime. As he realized whose jersey it was, Williams smiled, shook his head and said, “Damn you, Puka.”\n\nThe reaction was lighthearted, but the meaning was clear.

    "description": "Sergey Brin, Max Levchin, Eric Schmidt, and others donated $35 million to ballot measure committees in January.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin is one of the many California-based billionaires pouring millions into donations ahead of the state's proposed wealth tax.\n\nBrin, along with other tech executives, venture capitalists, and philanthropists, donated a combined $35 million to ballot measure committees in January, supporting affordable housing ballots in California, per a disclosure seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe disclosure was filed by the coalition \"Building a Better California.\"\n\nBrin was the largest contributor in the filing, donating $20 million. Others donated large sums on various days in January, like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and PayPal CEO Max Levchin, who donated $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\n\nOthers in the list include DoorDash CEO Tony Xu, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, and Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr.\n\nBrin's multimillion-dollar donation comes ahead of California's vote on a measure that would levy a one-time, 5% tax on billionaires in the state. The tax, due in 2027, would be imposed retroactively from January 1 this year.\n\nGroups like the one Brin donated to are part of a concerted push by billionaires to negate the need for the wealth tax, either by funding alternative programs or by funneling money into political action committees opposed to the measure.\n\nReactions to the potential tax have been mixed. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he's \"perfectly fine\" with it, saying this month that Silicon Valley's talent pool was worth any taxes.\n\nHowever, other executives have taken a more defensive stance. Brin and Google's other cofounder, Larry Page, moved an LLC they are both tied to from California to Delaware in December.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said the tax would be \"horrendous\" for innovation. White House AI czar David Sacks said the tax, if enacted, would be akin to an \"asset seizure.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported that Palantir's chairman, Peter Thiel, donated $3 million to the California Business Roundtable in December, which has directly opposed the wealth tax.\n\nRepresentatives for the executives did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Authorities discovered a massive stash of illegal firearms and a secret underground bunker at the base of a 100-foot tunnel on a MAGA activist's property in Northern California.",
    "fullText": "Shasta County authorities started out investigating a suspected illegal marijuana farm but ended up making a far more unsettling discovery: a massive stash of illegal firearms and a secret underground bunker at the base of a 100-foot tunnel on a MAGA activist's property.\n\nMichael Jay Kamfolt, 40, was arrested Jan. 20 after members of the California Highway Patrol discovered the bunker and confiscated an array of illegally possessed weapons — including three AR-15-style assault rifles, a sawed-off shotgun and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition — while serving a search warrant at his Anderson home. He is no longer in custody, according to county records.\n\n“This operation went far beyond an illegal grow,\" CHP Northern Division Chief John Pinoli said in a statement. \"The combination of a hidden bunker and an alarming cache of illegal firearms and ammunition highlights the threat posed to public safety.\"\n\nKamfolt is a well-known conservative activist who had shown up at protests and county Board of Supervisors meetings and had repeatedly raised concerns about voting fraud, according to reports from the Shasta Scout. Shasta County has become a hotbed for hard-right governance and election denialism in the Trump era of American politics, and a staunchly conservative majority took control of the county board in 2022.\n\nKamfolt is a strong advocate of Kevin Crye, a county supervisor and MAGA supporter. Kamfolt described himself as a “good friend” of Crye who would “do anything to help him out,\" while confronting protesters outside of Crye's business in May 2025, according to the Shasta Scout.\n\nCrye is a pro-Trump election denier and survived a recall effort by just 50 votes in March 2024. The effort was launched after he led a successful effort to have the county ditch Dominion voting machines in favor of hand-counting ballots.\n\nIn a Facebook video posted the day after Kamfolt's arrest, Crye said, \"It came to my attention today that a supporter and I'll even say a friend of mine was arrested last night, and my heart is truly broken.\"\n\nCrye said he was caught off guard by the news but urged people \"not to rush to judgment.\" \"Remember we are innocent until proven guilty,\" he said.\n\nThe CHP initially received a December tip about a suspected illegal marijuana grow on Kamfolt's property in Anderson, a small city 10 miles south of Redding.\n\nOfficers then secured a search warrant and conducted a flight over the area. They continued to investigate for a month before searching Kamfolt's property on Dec. 20, when they discovered the bunker equipped with all the supplies necessary to cultivate marijuana including power, ventilation and a concrete floor with built-in drainage.\n\nLocated at the base of a 100-foot water drainage pipe, the sprawling secret cavern also contained a home gym, armchair and television. The wall decor included a Bennington flag, which was among the various historical American flags carried by supporters of President Trump during the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nWhile on the property, officers seized 13 firearms, four soft body armor vests and 30 high-capacity magazines. Two of the guns were reported stolen, one in 2016 and the other in 1978, according to the CHP.\n\nKamfolt was arrested on suspicion of an array of misdemeanor and felony weapons-related violations. They include converting a firearm into a machine gun, manufacturing a ghost gun, possession of a stolen firearm and possession of armor penetrating ammunition.\n\nThe CHP's investigation is ongoing, and so far a case has not been presented to the Shasta County district attorney's office for filing consideration, according to a department spokesperson.\n\nKamfolt was no longer in custody on Monday, according to Shasta County inmate records. The county Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on when he was released.\n\nA.

On Monday it was new defensive line coach Charlie Partridge and analyst Nick Sebastian making the trip.\n\nWhile Toilolo is ranked as the No. 536 overall prospect in the 247Sports Composite, you have to trust Notre Dame’s player evaluations.\n\nThe Irish have done a great job in identifying players who are flying under the radar, and that could be the case with Toilolo. It’s going to be tough to pull him from the West Coast, but if there’s a team that can do it, it’s Notre Dame.\n\nThank you to @NDFootball @CoachPartridge and @NickSebas_ for visiting me at school this afternoon.

    "fullText": "A mother has been arrested after a 19-month-old child was seen flying out of a car while it was making a turn at an intersection in Orange County.\n\nThe Fullerton Police Department issued a statement Monday saying officials there became aware of a video circulating on social media showing the toddler fall out of a black SUV as it turned onto Malvern Avenue from Euclid Street in Fullerton earlier this week.\n\nOfficials clarified that the incident is believed to have occurred between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. on Jan. 20 and that no calls for service were received in relation to the child falling. The same intersection was the site of a crash involving a group of fleeing jewel thieves three days later.\n\n‘Graffiti-proof’ ivy was installed along a busy Los Angeles freeway. It didn’t work so well\n\nIn the footage, which was taken from the dashcam of a vehicle driving the opposite direction, depicts the front passenger side door of the SUV swinging open as it turned left from Malvern onto Euclid.\n\nUpon the child falling out, the SUV stopped abruptly – Fullerton police noted that the driver “nearly caused a traffic collision” with the vehicle behind it – and a woman was seen running from the driver’s side to where the child fell. She picked up the child and returned to the vehicle before the video ended.\n\nFour days later, a witness came forward to police and reported the incident. An investigation was conducted that led to a residence in La Habra, and the SUV, child and woman seen in the video were all located there.\n\n“The female, identified as Jacqueline Hernandez, a 35-year-old resident of La Habra and the child’s mother, was placed under arrest and booked at the Fullerton City Jail for felony child abuse,” Fullerton police stated Monday.\n\n3 men, including 1 who fled to Vietnam, in custody for California teen’s killing; 4th suspect believed to be in Jordan\n\nThe child was said by authorities to have sustained injuries “consistent with the fall” and was hospitalized. They are expected to make a full recovery.\n\nAnyone with information that could aid the ongoing investigation is asked to contact Fullerton Police Department Sensitive Crimes Unit Detective H. Rios: 714-738-6782 or hrios@fullertonpd.org.\n\nTo submit anonymous information, call O.C. Crime Stoppers: 1-855-847-6227.",

Newsom’s accusation on Monday came as a number of users on TikTok reported abnormalities and accused the platform of censoring their posts.\n\nSteve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University’s School of Law, said a video he recorded about reports federal immigration officers could use sweeping power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant had been placed “under review”.\n\nCasey Fiesler, an expert in technology ethics and internet law at the University of Colorado told CNN it was “not surprising that there’s a significant lack of trust” in TikTok’s new ownership. She told the outlet that she had problems uploading videos that alluded to the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nLast week’s TikTok deal was a milestone for the firm after years of battles with the US government over Washington’s concerns about risks to national security and privacy under Trump and former President Joe Biden.\n\nByteDance said TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC would secure US user data, apps and algorithms through data privacy and cybersecurity measures, in a deal praised by Trump.\n\nWith more than 16 million followers on his personal TikTok account, Trump credited the app with helping him win the 2024 election.\n\nThe deal provides for American and global investors to hold 80.1% of the venture while ByteDance will own 19.9%.\n\nEach of the joint venture’s three managing investors, cloud computing giant Oracle, private equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX, will hold a stake of 15%.\n\nThe US and Chinese governments had signed off on the deal, a White House official said.",

    "fullText": "Jan 26 (Reuters) - Attorneys for Meta Platforms and other social media companies asked a California federal judge on Monday to block several school districts from taking their lawsuits against the companies to trial, arguing that federal law protects them from claims they ​knowingly addicted young users.\n\nAt a hearing before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, lawyers for the companies clashed with counsel ‌for six school districts from states across the country, who argue the platforms' design has harmed students' mental health and forced districts to spend money and staff time to address the fallout.\n\nThe companies urged ‌the judge to rule that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally shields platforms like Meta's Facebook and Instagram from liability over user-generated content, bars the cases from proceeding to the first trials in federal court over the claims.\n\nJonathan Blavin, an attorney for the social media companies, said the schools’ allegations rely on evidence that includes such content, placing the claims within the protections of Section 230.\n\n\"If that evidence is entirely excluded, I think the record here is incredibly thin,\" Blavin said. \"It's just ⁠not there.\"\n\nLawyers for the school districts countered that their ‌claims are not based on user-content but on platform features they say are intentionally designed to keep young people on the social media sites as long as possible.\n\nAndre Mura, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said their experts had examined broad studies of ‍students who had used social media to support their findings that it had harmed them.\n\n“The literature shows the increase in the risk of harm is not based on content,” he said.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS IN STATE, FEDERAL COURT\n\nMeta, Snapchat and parent Snap Inc., YouTube and parent Alphabet Inc., and TikTok and parent ByteDance are facing thousands of lawsuits in both federal and ​state court over claims they knowingly designed their platforms to have features that addict children and teens, fueling a mental health crisis.\n\nThe first trial testing ‌the claims in state court is slated for this week in Los Angeles.\n\nThe federal cases have been consolidated into multidistrict litigation before Rogers and include lawsuits brought by families, school districts and state governments.\n\nMonday's hearing focused only on cases filed by school districts, which claim they have been hurt financially from having to manage student mental health issues and social problems like cyberbullying. Rogers is considering whether to enter judgment for the companies in six of those lawsuits, selected as so-called \"bellwether\" or test cases, ahead of the first trials in federal court, currently scheduled to begin in June.\n\nBellwether trials are used to gauge how juries may respond to similar ⁠claims and help establish settlement values for the other similar cases in the litigation.\n\nIn rulings ​on the companies’ motions to dismiss in 2023 and 2024, Rogers said the cases could go ​forward, but Section 230 limited many of their claims, including some about specific features of the platforms.\n\nOn Monday, Rogers agreed that the plaintiffs had a lot of evidence that seemed to be based on content and said that should the cases go forward, there ‍would be a lengthy debate about what ⁠could be shown to the juries.\n\nBut even if the actual content played some role, Rogers said that juries were often asked to examine a problem with several causes and determine which were primarily to blame.\n\n“It’s not like we have a white and a yolk, it’s all scrambled together,” Rogers ⁠said. “That’s a very common circumstance. Why should this be any different?”\n\nThe case is In Re: Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District ‌of California, No. 4:22-md-03047.\n\nFor plaintiffs: Andre Mura of Gibbs Mura; Previn Warren of Motley Rice\n\nFor defendants: Jonathan Blavin of Munger Tolles & Olson; ‌Ashley Hardin of Williams & Connolly; Christian Pistilli of Covington & Burling",

    "description": "California has hailed itself as a leader in single-use plastic reduction and legislation. But a scuttling of its pioneering law, and a new report on the dismal state of recycling in the state, shows things aren't so green in the Golden State.",
    "fullText": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nCalifornia touts itself as a leader on the problem of plastic garbage, but recent developments suggest otherwise.\n\nA new report issued by the state’s waste agency shows plastic yogurt containers, shampoo bottles and restaurant takeout trays are being recycled at rates only in the single digits.\n\nPolypropylene, labeled as #5 on packaging, is used for yogurt containers, margarine tubs and microwavable trays. Only 2% of it is getting recycled. Colored shampoo and detergent bottles, made from polyethylene, or #1 plastic, are getting recycled at a rate of just 5%.\n\nOther plastics, including ones promoted as highly recyclable, such as clear polyethylene bottles, which hold some medications, or hard water bottles, are being recycled at just 16%.\n\nNo plastic in the report exceeds a recycling rate of 23%, with the majority reported in just the single digits.\n\nAdding to this disquieting assessment, CalRecycle also just pulled back regulations that were supposed to finalize a landmark single-use plastic law known as Senate Bill 54 — a law designed to make the majority of packaging waste in the state recyclable or compostable by working with the plastic and packaging industries.\n\nThe report and delay have sparked a wide variety of reactions by those who have closely watched the law as it was written and implemented.\n\nThe proposed regulations were regarded as friendly to industry. As a result, some are hopeful that CalRecycle’s decision to pull them back for tweaking means the agency will make the law stronger. Others say the two developments just show the state has never really been serious about plastic recycling.\n\n“California’s SB 54 ... will NEVER increase the recycling rates of these items ... because cartons and plastic packaging are fundamentally not technically or economically recyclable,” said Jan Dell, the founder of Orange County-based Last Beach Cleanup, an anti-plastic organization.\n\nIndustry representatives are also expressing disappointment, saying the more delays and changes the state makes, the harder it is “for California businesses to comply with the law and implement the resulting changes,” said John Myers, a spokesman for the California Chamber of Commerce, which represents companies that will be affected.\n\nReports on abysmally low rates of recycling for milk cartons and polystyrene have been widely shared and known. But the newest numbers were still a grim confirmation that there are few options for dealing with these materials.\n\nAccording to one state analysis, 2.9 million tons of single-use plastic and 171.4 billion single-use plastic components were sold, offered for sale or distributed in California in 2023.\n\nSingle-use plastics and plastic waste more broadly are considered a growing environmental and health problem. In recent decades, plastic waste has overwhelmed waterways and oceans, sickening marine life and threatening human health.\n\nLast spring, the Newsom administration was accused of neutering the regulations that CalRecycle had initially proposed to implement the law. The changes excluded all packaging material related to produce, meat, dairy products, dog food, toothpaste, condoms, shampoo and cereal boxes, among other products. These are all products that might fall under the purview of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nIt also opened the door to “alternative” recycling, such as chemical recycling, which environmentalists say is polluting, and was banned in the language of the law.\n\nThe waste agency then submitted those draft regulations to the Office of Administrative Law, whose lawyers and staff review proposed regulations to ensure they are “clear, necessary, legally valid, and available to the public” before finalizing them. They were set to release their determination on Friday; CalRecycle pulled the regulations back before the office issued its determination.\n\nNeither the law office nor governor’s office responded to requests for comment.\n\nMelanie Turner, CalRecycle’s spokeswoman, said the agency withdrew its proposed regulations “to make changes ... to improve clarity and support successful implementation of the law,” and its revisions were focused on areas that dealt with “food and agricultural commodities.”\n\nCalifornia state Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), author of the original legislation, called the delay “entirely avoidable” in a statement, but said it would allow CalRecycle an “opportunity to ensure the regulations truly follow the law as it was signed.”\n\nHe urged the waste agency and Newsom’s administration not to “allow broad, sweeping exemptions that would undermine the program and increase costs for ratepayers.”\n\nCritics of the watered-down regulations, such as Anja Brandon, the director of plastics policy for the Ocean Conservancy, said she wasn’t surprised by the withdrawal.\n\nThe proposed regulations “would have gone beyond CalRecycle’s authority by creating a sweeping categorical exclusion for food and agricultural packaging — effectively a loophole that would have allowed producers to continue putting vast amounts of plastic packaging into the marketplace, completely undermining SB 54’s goals and success,” she said in a text message.\n\nTurner said CalRecycle will conduct a 15-day comment period — although when that begins has not yet been divulged.",

    "fullText": "World number one Scottie Scheffler launched his 2026 US PGA Tour campaign with a runaway victory in the American Express at La Quinta, California.\n\nScheffler, whose 2025 season included two major titles among six victories, piled up nine birdies in a six-under par 66 on the Stadium Course, where even a double-bogey at the 17th was barely a blip on the way to a 27-under par total of 261 and a four-shot victory.\n\nAustralian veteran Jason Day climbed into a share of second with a superb eight-under par 64. He was joined on 265 by Americans Ryan Gerard, Matt McCarty and Andrew Putnam, Gerard posting a seven-under 65 and McCarty and Putnam each signing for a 68.\n\nScheffler, 29, became the first player since Tiger Woods to grab his 20th US PGA Tour title before the age of 30. He's off to his fifth straight season with at least one victory.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" Scheffler said. \"It was a challenging week. I did a good job of staying patient and executing when I needed to.\"\n\nScheffler, who hasn't missed a cut on the PGA Tour since August 2022, started the day one off the lead and opened with a birdie. He bogeyed the second before settling in with back-to-back birdies at four and five and another pair at seven and eight.\n\nHe added four more birdies coming in, his four-footer at the par-five 16th pushing him to 29-under.\n\nHe was in the water off the tee on the way to a double-bogey at the par-three 17th, but by then there was no catching him.\n\nOvernight leader Kim Si-woo of South Korea carded an even par 72 to tie for sixth on 22-under.\n\nTeenager Blades Brown, who started the day tied with Scheffler on 21-under, closed with a two-over 74 for a share of 18th.\n\nIt finished off a remarkable week for the 18-year-old from Tennessee, who tied for 17th in a Korn Ferry event in the Bahamas on Wednesday before a dash to California to tee it up on a sponsor's exemption.\n\nHe flirted with a 59 on Friday, when a 60 gave him a share of the halfway lead. He had a birdie chance at 18 for a share of 10th -- and a place in the Torrey Pines field.\n\nHe closed with a bogey but departed happy with his week.\n\n\"I could probably write a book about what I've learned these past couple of days,\" Brown said.\n\n\"Just knowing that I can compete out here. It was so cool watching Scottie win in person and getting to play with him.\n\n\"He's such an unbelievable guy. He talked to me numerous times throughout the round and was giving me a lot of encouragement, so it was awesome.\"",

He doesn’t look out of place at all among the regulars.\n\nThe final round will see him tee it up alongside Scottie Scheffler and Si Woo Kim—a massive opportunity for the teenager to test himself against established names.\n\nHe’s also shown plenty of composure throughout the week, playing smart and staying patient when things weren’t falling his way early on. That kind of maturity is rare for someone so new to this level.\n\nIf he can pull it off, he’ll become the youngest PGA Tour winner since Charles Kocsis won the 1931 Michigan Open—a remarkable feat for any player, let alone one still new to life on tour.\n\nJustin Rose has had a remarkable career, and his list of achievements speaks for itself.\n\nHis US Open title, Olympic gold medal, 26 professional wins, and seven Ryder Cup appearances highlight an impressive resume.\n\nThe 45-year-old has managed to stay relevant at the top level of the game for a long time, which is no small feat.\n\nBut his early days in professional golf were far from easy.\n\nAfter turning pro in 1998, he missed 21 straight cuts and struggled to find his footing on tour.\n\nRose made the leap into the pro ranks right after finishing T-4 at The Open Championship at Royal Birkdale in 1998.\n\nThat memorable hole-out on the final green is still fresh in many minds.\n\nRose began that Sunday fifth on the leaderboard and climbed to fourth with a strong round of 69 in very tough conditions.\n\nAfter shooting a 68 in Saturday’s third round of the American Express, Blades Brown finished the day tied for second and matched a 28-year PGA Tour record originally set by Justin Rose.\n\nHe’s now the first player aged 18 or younger to be inside the top five after three rounds of a PGA Tour event since Rose did it at The Open in 1998.\n\nJustin Ray, who is known for his detailed golf stats, shared this information on his official X account:\n\nBrown’s run at the American Express has been nothing short of remarkable.\n\nMatching a record that Justin Rose set nearly three decades ago really shows how well he’s played this week.",

Ellis is a member of Patriotic Millionaires, a collection of wealthy Americans who advocate for a fair tax system, a livable wage, and equal access to political power. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI never thought I'd live in California. I grew up in Colorado, went to college in Boston, and lived in Texas. I came out here for business school because I wanted to be at Stanford, and because you could play golf during the winter.\n\nNow I love it here. It has nothing to do with taxes; taxes have never been anywhere on our list of criteria for deciding where to live. I want to live where my family is and love the weather, the jobs, and the dynamism.\n\nTaxes are the price that we pay to live in a civil society. We have to do this together. There are examples all around the world of the power of effective government, and just like anything else, government needs to be funded. We should make it effective and efficient.\n\nI'm proud to pay the taxes I pay. I should pay taxes that are higher than other people because I have more wealth than other people — that makes sense.\n\nA lot of our financial success has been due to my wife's success, as well as mine at the beginning of our careers.\n\nI went to Harvard undergrad, worked at McKinsey for three years, and then went to Stanford. I then worked at Hewlett-Packard for almost eight years.\n\nIn 2007, my wife was a VP at Yahoo and we had two small kids. I looked at my boss's job, and at the CEO's job, and decided I didn't ever want those roles. I thought, \"Uh-oh, I'm on this ladder, and it's not really where I want to go.\"\n\nUltimately, my wife and I decided that I would step back and be the stay-at-home parent. My wife continued her career, and she's been very successful in consumer internet at Yahoo, Google, and Pinterest.\n\nI studied poverty, urban America, housing, transportation, and sociology in college, and started thinking more about questions like: What does fairness look like? What does justice look like? What would it look like to build a great society?\n\nI got busy pursuing my career, meeting my wife, and raising our kids, but as time passed and we progressed in our careers, I got back into thinking about how we help others around us. I did a bunch of volunteer work in different contexts, eventually becoming the COO and then the CSO of a nonprofit called New Teacher Center, which does intensive mentoring programs for new teachers.\n\nSince 2012, I've started and run several nonprofits in the education space, and advised almost 200 individuals and organizations on things like strategy, finance, operations, and culture.\n\nI'm also really focused on addressing excessive wealth and its impact on society and thinking about a future vision for American democracy, which is how I came to Patriotic Millionaires, an organization of wealthy Americans who advocate for higher taxes on wealthy people like ourselves, a higher minimum wage, and a broader distribution of political power across our society.\n\nIn recent years, I've been struck by the massive accumulation of wealth enabled by the consumer internet space, globalization, and the structure of the finance industry. It's different from what it used to be in the '80s and '90s; this is a whole new ballgame.\n\nMore recently, I've been looking around Silicon Valley at all these people who are so incredibly wealthy, talented, and successful, and realizing how few of them are thinking about choosing to build a better society together.\n\nThey're excited about starting new companies and raising new funds, but these are all people who have more money than they could ever spend, and their next goal is to generate even more money, mainly for people who already have more money than they could ever spend.\n\nMeanwhile, 10% of our society is in poverty. It really feels unfair and wrong, and we can do better.\n\nThe proposed billionaire wealth tax in California doesn't impact me and my family directly. People may think, \"You're happy to raise taxes on other people.\"\n\nBut we need to start with a different conversation, about how much wealth is enough, how much wealth is too much, and what is financial success?\n\nI believe that if you have $30 million in wealth, congratulations, you won capitalism. If you do the analysis of reasonable investment returns and inflation, you can buy a really nice first house, a nice second house, your kids' college is paid for, your end-of-life expenses are covered, and you have a very, very luxurious ongoing existence.\n\nSo much of success in life is luck. Yes, people absolutely get educated and work hard. But it's been found that the wealthier people are, the more they tend to attribute their wealth to how good they are and how hard they worked.\n\nI look at single moms working three jobs, working the night shift — a heck of a lot of people who have less than $190,000 [the median household wealth] in wealth are working very hard.\n\nOnce you get beyond $30 million — and almost no one ever gets there — you get to a point where your life is so good, you really can't materially improve your life anymore. We should implement a very aggressive annual 50% tax on all household wealth over $30 million. Excessive wealth turns into excessive power through huge campaign donations, which threatens and undermines democracy and capitalism.\n\nI'm absolutely delighted that we're moving in this direction, but I believe changes to wealth taxes need to happen at the federal level.\n\nWhen wealthy folks bring up moving out of California, it's a distraction. All of a sudden, instead of us talking about the fact that millions of people are going to be either losing healthcare or paying much more for healthcare, we're worried about the 200 really rich people who might move.\n\nPeople move all the time. Companies move all the time for all kinds of reasons — it's just part of business. These conversations happen all the time — like, \"Oh my gosh, there won't be any more companies in Silicon Valley.\" Well, 20 years later, look around. There are still some companies here; it's just fine.\n\nIt's 65 degrees and sunny here. The CEO of Nvidia recently said they'll be staying in California because that's where the talent is. We've got the Golden Gate Bridge, Hollywood, Tahoe, the Redwoods, the beach, and great weather. I'm really not worried that people aren't going to want to live in California.\n\nI love it here. My wife and I are thinking about living in different cities for maybe a month at a time, but I have no plans to go anywhere else. Although I definitely love Colorado — I still have my Denver Broncos coasters and will be cheering for my Broncos — I'm from Silicon Valley now, and that's where I'm going to stay.",

They did not reveal the person's identity.\n\nThe rescuers then returned to Lone Pine just before 6:00 p.m.\n\n“The incident occurred within Tulare County jurisdiction, and proper notification was made to the Tulare County Sheriff's Office,” Inyo County Search & Rescue continued.\n\nThe news comes after the body of a missing 21-year-old hiker was recovered on Mount Whitney, Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nPEOPLE also previously reported that a father of two died after falling from a trail while climbing Mount Whitney in October.\n\nIn their recent statement, the Inyo County Search & Rescue said the “recent fatalities on Mount Whitney and Mount Baldy, serves as a reminder that winter ascents are serious mountaineering endeavors, not hikes.”\n\n“Winter conditions leave little margin for error, and the consequences can be severe,” they added. “Additionally, many fatalities occur when individuals travel solo or when groups separate.”\n\nThey went on to say that the safety concerns of a person in a group “ should be taken seriously.”\n\n“Fatigue is also a critical contributing factor,” they added. “Extended periods of exertion negatively impact decision-making and increase the likelihood of missteps and falls. Knowing when to turn around can save lives.\"\n\nThe statement from rescuers concluded, “Please be respectful in your comments. The victim’s family and friends may be following this post, and some comments may be hurtful. Thank you!”\n\nMount Whitney is the tallest mountain in the contiguous U.S., according to the National Park Service’s website. The elevation at the summit is reported to be 14,505 feet.",

    "fullText": "Teenager Blades Brown fired a spectacular 12-under par 60 to join world number one Scottie Scheffler atop the leaderboard after two rounds of the PGA Tour American Express in La Quinta, California, on Friday.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Tennessee just missed out on a 59 when his birdie putt at his final hole slipped by on the right side.\n\n\"I'm so stoked to have shot 60 on the PGA Tour,\" Brown said, acknowledging that nerves \"absolutely\" kicked in over the final three holes.\n\nHe had made a dazzling start on the Nicklaus Tournament course, one of three in use over the first three rounds of the event.\n\nBrown, who made his pro debut at La Quinta last year, teed off on 10 and was eight under through his first seven holes thanks to an eagle and six birdies.\n\nAfter a birdie at the second he strung together three more at the fourth, fifth and sixth to reach 12-under for the day.\n\nHe couldn't capitalize on the par-five seventh, settling for a par after his second shot found the rough.\n\nAfter a par at the eighth he had one more chance at the 16th sub-60 round ever on the PGA Tour at the par-four ninth, where a mammoth drive and a crisp wedge left him a birdie look from inside seven feet that he couldn't convert.\n\n\"I saw my spot just a little before the hole,\" he said. \"I got a great read off David Ford. He dripped it in there and it went right dead center. So I was thinking, OK, maybe just a little outside right edge.\n\n\"Unfortunately it didn't go in, but I'm really happy with the outcome I had today.\"\n\nIt was the continuation of a whirlwind week for Brown, who finished tied for 17th in the Korn Ferry developmental tour event in the Bahamas on Wednesday, then, with a sponsor's exemption to play in La Quinta, made his way to California in time to tee it up on Thursday.\n\nHe goes into the weekend tied on 17-under 127 with Scheffler, who had eight birdies in his eight-under 64 on the Nicklaus Tournament course.\n\nScheffler is making his season debut after a 2025 campaign that included two major titles among his six wins.\n\nThrilled to have his name next to Scheffler's atop the leaderboard, Brown wasn't getting ahead of himself.\n\n\"We're halfway there. We've got a lot of golf to go,\" he said, adding that his next order of business would be getting some rest.\n\n\"I'm going to go take a nap,\" Brown said.\n\nThe leading duo were one stroke clear of South Korean Kim Si-Woo, who posted a 65 on the tougher Stadium Course for a 16-under total of 128.\n\nIt was a further stroke back to South Korea's Kim Seong-hyeon and American Matt McCarty.\n\nAmerican Andrew Putnam also flirted with a 59 before settling for a 12-under 60 on the La Quinta course that left him 12-under for the tournament.",

    "description": "Ryan Wedding turned himself in at US consulate in Mexico City and is due to appear in court in California on Monday",
    "fullText": "Ryan Wedding, the Canadian Olympic snowboarder turned alleged drug kingpin, has been arrested after turning himself in at the US embassy in Mexico, law enforcement officials announced on Friday.\n\nWedding, 44, had been sought by the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for his role in overseeing what the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, called the “one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations” in the world.\n\n“He thought he could evade justice … here we are today, bringing him to justice,” the FBI director, Kash Patel, said from an airfield in California, calling Wedding the “largest narco-trafficker in modern times”.\n\nMexico’s security minister, Omar García Harfuch, said that Wedding “surrendered voluntarily” at the US embassy in Mexico City on Wednesday after evading police for nearly a decade.\n\nWedding was flown from Mexico to California and is custody. He is due to appear in court on Monday in California. He is charged with drug trafficking, conspiracy to murder, witness tampering and money laundering.\n\nOfficials in the US allege that Wedding’s organisation had moved nearly 60 metric tons of cocaine a year into Los Angeles from Mexico using a network of semitrucks. Wedding is also accused of ordering the killing of a key FBI witness as well as several other murders, including that of a couple who were killed in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nSince 2023, the RCMP and the FBI have been collaborating on a sprawling investigation known as Operation Giant Slalom. In March, 2025, Wedding was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted List.\n\n“We told you in November we would find Mr Wedding. Today, that day has arrived,” said Akil Davis, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office. “The long arm of the law extends beyond our border.”\n\nDavid said the arrest was a “good day” for victims. “Ryan Wedding tormented several people and several families that will never be the same,” he said. “But today, they get the justice that they sought.”\n\nDavis said in addition to “crushing sanctions” against 19 people, including Wedding, authorities also seized a Mercedes sports car worth $15m and motorcycles worth $40m.\n\nUS authorities had previously said that they believed Wedding to be in hiding in Mexico. On Thursday, Patel was in Mexico City for what he called “pre-planned” meetings with the country’s security chief, García Harfuch. And on Friday morning he left with a souvenir: Ryan Wedding, and another, unnamed, “priority objective”.\n\nThe decision for an FBI director to be present in the field for an arrest is exceedingly rare and speaks to the political focus on capturing Wedding.\n\nGarcía Harfuch released a statement saying that Patel was leaving with “a non-US citizen who was arrested by Mexican authorities and is among the FBI’s 10 most wanted, and a Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered yesterday at the US embassy”.\n\n“If it’s true that he handed himself in, this may be an attempt to negotiate better terms,” said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, an analyst with the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime. “Maybe it gives him a little more room for manoeuvre.”\n\nOr there could be another explanation: he feared for his safety in Mexico, said Farfán-Méndez.\n\nThe arrest comes at a time of tension in North America, with Mark Carney and Donald Trump clashing at Davos, and renewed threats of US military strikes on Mexican cartel targets.\n\n“There was a message from the secretary of state, talking about the need for tangible results [against organised crime],” said Farfán-Méndez. “I think grabbing Ryan Wedding is a very media-friendly way to show tangible results. I think it could be filed under that column.”\n\nAlejandro Rosales Castillo, one of the FBI’s 10 most wanted fugitives, who is accused of the murder of a woman in North Carolina in 2016, was also arrested. A US citizen, he crossed the border to Mexico in 2017 and was in hiding for almost a decade until he was captured in Pachuca, Hidalgo, on 16 January.\n\nNBC News first announced news of the arrest and US law enforcement officials familiar with the operation confirmed it to the Guardian.\n\nIn March, the FBI announced a $15m reward for the capture of Wedding, whose nicknames include “Public Enemy”, “El Jefe” and “Giant”.\n\nAt the time,Patel, compared Wedding to Pablo Escobar and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.\n\nThe head of the RCMP, Michael Duheme was also present at the announcement and said “no single country” can break up transnational drug-trafficking organizations.\n\nWedding was allegedly being protected by the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico while he was on the run.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that Wedding’s significance in the international drug trade had been exaggerated by US authorities and the media.\n\n“There’s been a high-level characterisation of Wedding as a major kingpin. There was a $15m reward for him. At least from a media standpoint, he was a big fish,” said Farfán-Méndez. “But I think the indictment gives a different sense of proportion.”\n\nThough US authorities claim Wedding’s enterprise was trafficking 60 tonnes of cocaine a year, this figure does not appear in the indictment, which only mentions specific cases of a few hundred kilos being moved at a time.\n\n“These arrests are important for law enforcement,” said Farfán-Méndez. “But whether they impact [drug] supply is another question.”",

    "title": "Tesla discontinues Autopilot to boost adoption of its Full Self-Driving software",
    "description": "The company is also currently facing a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in California for deceptive marketing about Autopilot's capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Tesla has discontinued Autopilot, its basic driver-assistance system, as the company tries to boost adoption of a more advanced version of the technology that it calls Full Self-Driving (Supervised).\n\nThe decision comes as the company faces a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in its largest U.S. market, California. A judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD for years. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which originally brought the case and has a say over the licenses, stayed the ruling for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply by dropping the Autopilot name.\n\nAutopilot was a combination of Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which sticks to a designated speed while maintaining distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a lane-centering feature that could steer the car around curves.\n\nTesla’s online configuration site now states new cars now come standard with only Traffic Aware Cruise Control. It’s not clear if current customers are affected.\n\nThe decision comes one week after the company said that starting on February 14, it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software. After that, customers will only be able to access FSD through a monthly subscription of $99 — though Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a post on Thursday that the subscription price will increase as the software’s capabilities improve.\n\nMusk believes that Tesla’s newer cars will be capable of “unsupervised” driving, saying FSD advances will allow drivers to “be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride.” In December, he said a new version of FSD allowed the former, though texting while driving is illegal in almost all states.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla rolled out the first robotaxi versions of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, that have no human safety personnel in the cars. Those vehicles are running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software and are still followed by the company’s cars for supervision.\n\nTesla launched the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software in late 2020, but adoption has always lagged behind the expectations of executives like Musk. In October 2025, Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said only 12% of all Tesla customers had paid for the software. Hitting “10 million active FSD subscriptions” by 2035 is one of the key “product goals” required for Musk to receive the full payout of his new $1 trillion pay package. \n\nTesla first introduced Autopilot in the early 2010s after talks broke down between Musk and Google to leverage the tech being developed by the search giant’s then-nascent autonomous driving division (which eventually got spun out into Waymo). Tesla made the driver-assistance system standard on all of its vehicles in April 2019.\n\nAcross the decade-plus of Autopilot’s existence, Tesla struggled with communicating the software’s capabilities. The company often overpromised and made the tech seem more capable than it was, leading some drivers to become overly confident in its abilities, which in turn led to hundreds of crashes and at least 13 fatalities, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump lashed out at Gavin Newsom for spoiling his appearance at the Davos, Switzerland, summit this week.\n\nThe California governor attended the forum, spending his time criticizing the president and his administration while urging allies to “stand united.” At one point, the 58-year-old claimed he was denied entry into the U.S. hub.\n\nNewsom looked on as Trump addressed political and business leaders on Wednesday, then criticized the president’s “boring, and at times boorish,” speech.\n\n“It was insignificant in its insignificance. He said what we all knew: that he’s not going to invade Greenland,” he told The Guardian.\n\nTrump, who has backed down from his threat of military invasion and tariffs on other European nations, still couldn’t seem to get over Newsom’s appearance.\n\n“Gavin Newscum, as a “Lame Duck” Governor of a Failing State, should not be at Davos running around screaming for the attention of Foreign Leaders, and embarrassing our Country,“ Trump, 79, grumbled on Truth Social. “He made a mockery of himself, and everybody, including his staff, knows it!”\n\nTrump went on to attack the governor, who is term-limited and cannot run for re-election in 2028, on California-specific issues.\n\n“With a record like he’s got,” Trump concluded, “the ruination of one of the most beautiful places on Earth, where people are leaving in droves, it is unimaginable that he could run for President but, who knows, it’s a very strange World!”\n\nNewsom, 58, responded succinctly to Trump’s 158-word attack.\n\nNewsom also took shots at Trump’s backers who followed the president’s lead in criticizing him.\n\nWhen radio host Bill Mitchell captioned a photo of Newsom, “That look you have when you’re not winning and you know it,” the Democrat fired back: “That look when every MAGA doormat can’t stop talking about you.”\n\nIt was only a matter of time before White House Communications Director Steven Cheung got involved.\n\nCheung, who recently went after Newsom for criticizing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and world leaders at Davos who suck up to Trump, gave his own caption of Newsom’s photo.\n\n“The look of someone who realizes they’re at the point of no return and giving up control to others is the only way to satisfy his home life,” he wrote on X.\n\nThe Newsom bashing continued into the night on Fox News.\n\nWhile Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick did some pearl-clutching about Newsom selling kneepads with Trump’s signature, Katie Miller, the wife of Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, suggested that there was a large amount of voting and welfare fraud happening in his state, and complained that Newsom “still hasn’t turned over his voter rolls or welfare list to us.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted Newsom’s office and the White House for comment.\n\nPreviously, the White House told the Daily Beast, “No one in Davos knows who third-rate governor Newscum is or why he is frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.”",

    "description": "At Davos, the California governor criticized Trump, was blocked from the US pavilion, traded insults, waved kneepads, and fueled 2028 speculation.",
    "fullText": "Gavin Newsom's return to Davos was always going to be loud. It just wasn't clear how chaotic it would get.\n\nOver the course of a few days in the Swiss Alps, the California governor criticized President Donald Trump, was denied entry to the USA House, waved red kneepads at corporate leaders, and traded insults with Trump's Treasury secretary.\n\nNewsom had framed his attendance at the World Economic Forum as a direct challenge to Trump on the global stage.\n\nLast week, his office said he planned to rebut the president's economic agenda, defend \"democratic capitalism,\" and position California as a counterweight to what he called Trump's \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nTrump spoke first, addressing business and political leaders on Wednesday morning. Newsom, watching from the room, criticized the speech shortly afterward.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, including Business Insider's Ben Bergman, Newsom said the audience reaction was muted because Trump spoke down to people, adding that \"had there not been cellphones, I think a few people would have passed out from boredom.\"\n\nAnna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, later dismissed Newsom as a \"third-rate governor\" in comments to Business Insider, saying that it was unclear why he was \"frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.\"\n\nTensions escalated hours later on Wednesday when Newsom was denied entry to the USA House, the official US pavilion at Davos, where he was scheduled to talk in a fireside chat hosted by Fortune.\n\nNewsom's office said the invitation was rescinded at the last minute due to pressure from the White House and State Department.\n\nNewsom blasted the move on X, calling it \"weak and pathetic\" to block a fireside chat. His office said that multiple Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, had spoken at the pavilion earlier that day.\n\nBessent, for his part, didn't hold back. He publicly called Newsom \"economically illiterate,\" \"smug,\" and \"too self-absorbed,\" escalating what had already become a personal feud playing out in front of the global business elite.\n\nNewsom got his biggest moment on Thursday during another scheduled Davos appearance.\n\nIn an onstage interview with Semafor's Ben Smith, he said that the US was no longer governed by the rule of law but by what he called \"the rule of Don,\" accusing Congress, universities, law firms, and corporate leaders of bending the knee to the president.\n\nTo make the point, Newsom brought in bright red kneepads — a prop meant to symbolize corporate capitulation — drawing applause from the audience.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, acknowledged Newsom in his own Davos remarks on Wednesday. \"We're going to help the people in California,\" Trump said. \"We want to have no crime. I know Gavin was here. I used to get along so great with Gavin when I was president. Gavin is a good guy.\"\n\nThe governor declined a later invitation to return to the USA House for a private nightcap reception.\n\nPolitical experts told Business Insider that Newsom's return to Davos signals ambitions beyond California.\n\nHis decision to confront Trump in front of global business and political leaders has renewed speculation that he is laying the groundwork for a potential 2028 presidential bid.",

He will be back in Texas before the storm is projected to hit,” a spokesperson for the senator said in a statement, first shared with KHOU.\n\nMultiple critics invoked another moment from Cruz’s career where he went viral and earned plenty of mockery. In February 2021, Cruz was heavily criticized after took a trip to Cancun, Mexico, while Texas was hit with the deadly Winter Storm Uri.\n\nThe senator returned to Texas at the time and admitted his trip was “obviously a mistake.”\n\n“It was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it,” he said.\n\nThe latest storm is expected to stretch across 2,000 miles eventually, while it’ll begin in Texas and Oklahoma. Heavy snowfall and freezing rain are expected to begin Friday, hitting northern Texas and cities like Dallas and Houston. The storm will eventually move its way to the East Coast.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott (R) has declared a state of emergency in his state over the approaching harsh weather.\n\n“Based on current forecasts, the State of Texas is acting to ensure Texans have the resources they need before severe winter weather impacts communities across Texas,” the governor announced this week. “I thank emergency management personnel and first responders for working tirelessly to keep Texans safe.”\n\nThe post Ted Cruz Bites Back at Critics Furious Over His Leaving Texas Ahead of Major Winter Storm first appeared on Mediaite.",

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nThe Suns entered Wednesday’s matchup coming off a 113-108 loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors on Monday. With rookies Rasheer Fleming and Khaman Maluach, along with two-way player Jamaree Bouyea, assigned back to the team, the Valley hoped the trio would provide the spark needed to get back on track.\n\nFleming and Maluach had been traveling with the Phoenix Suns throughout the six-game road trip, earning minutes whenever the team needed them. Bouyea is coming off concussion protocol and has not played since early January.\n\nHowever, Wednesday’s game allowed the rookies to flourish with increased playing time.\n\nOct 24, 2025; Inglewood, California, USA; Los Angeles Clippers center Yanic Konan Niederhauser (14) defends Phoenix Suns center Khaman Maluach (10) in the second half at Intuit Dome.

Maluach added eight points and six rebounds but dealt with foul trouble, picking up three fouls before halftime. Bouyea struggled early but found a rhythm late in the half, finishing with nine points, two rebounds, and two assists at the break.\n\nDespite limited minutes, Bouyea’s strong finish to the first half suggested he was simply shaking off rust.\n\nThe Suns opened the second half on an 18-0 run, partly by Bouyea’s eight points. He finished the night with 27 points, while Fleming finished with 19 points and Maluach finished with 23.\n\nNov 24, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Rasheer Fleming (20) against the Houston Rockets at Mortgage Matchup Center.

Head coach Paul Jesperson acknowledged their earlier game struggles, especially Bouyea, as Wednesday was his first official night in a Valley Suns uniform.\n\n“We knew there was probably going to be a little fatigue there and a little bit of those guys just having to feel the game out a little bit as it progressed,” he said post-game. “I think [Bouyea] did exactly that. Kind of found his spots, got comfort level [and] got a little energy to him.”\n\nThe Suns finish out the week with a matchup against the Texas Legends on the road on Friday, Jan. 23, at 6:30 p.m.\n\nWM Phoenix Open brings golf to streetwear with Samba shoe collab",

    "fullText": "AI czar David Sacks said California is taking a potentially \"scary direction\" if voters approve a wealth tax on billionaires.\n\n\"This is not a tax, this is an asset seizure,\" Sacks told CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nSacks, a longtime venture capitalist, is just one of the many voices in the tech industry who have denounced \"The Billionaire Act.\"\n\nCraft Ventures, the firm Sacks cofounded with Bill Lee, previously announced that Sacks had relocated to the Austin area in December. According to Bloomberg, Sacks is a billionaire and thus could have been subject to the tax.\n\nWhile the proposal is limited, Sacks said it would just be the beginning.\n\n\"It's not a one-time. It's a first time,\" he said. \"And if they get away with it, there'll be a second time and a third time. And this will be the beginning of something very new and different in this country.\"\n\nIf passed, California residents with a net worth of over $1.1 billion would face a one-time tax totalling 5% of their assets. (Residents with a net worth between $1 billion and $1.1 billion would pay a smaller tax.)\n\nGoogle cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin moved entities tied to them out of California ahead of the deadline. Other billionaires, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have said they won't leave the state.\n\nThe tax has yet to be approved. Supporters are still gathering enough signatures to put the issue before California voters this November. If they meet that threshold, a majority of voters would then need to support it. It's likely legal challenges would ensue as well.\n\nSacks said Gov. Gavin Newsom deserves blame for the current situation for not opposing the tax sooner and \"vocally\" enough.\n\nTara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Newsom's office, pointed to the governor's history of questioning earlier wealth tax proposals going back to 2020.\n\n\"Clearly, David Sacks didn't know what he was talking about,\" she said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nIn recent weeks, Newsom has continued to step up his opposition to such a tax.\n\n\"I'll do what I have to do to protect the state,\" Newsom told The New York Times in an interview earlier this month.\n\nIn a separate interview, Newsom said the news that billionaires like Brin and Page were leaving the state was exactly the response he had feared. California is home to more billionaires than any other state.\n\n\"This is my fear. It's just what I warned against,\" Newsom told Politico. \"It's happening.\"",

    "fullText": "Snap’s chief executive had been due to testify in civil action also involving Meta, TikTok and YouTube\n\nSnapchat’s parent company has settled a civil lawsuit shortly before it was due to start in California, but other large tech companies still face a trial under the case.\n\nSnap’s chief executive, Evan Spiegel, had been due to testify in a tech addiction lawsuit which also involves the Instagram owner, Meta; ByteDance’s TikTok; and Alphabet-owned YouTube – which have not settled.\n\nSnap told the BBC the parties were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”.\n\nThe Snapchat parent was among those being sued by a plaintiff named K.G.M, a 19-year-old woman who alleges that she developed mental health problems after becoming addicted to social media apps.\n\nThe California case is the first of three “bellwether” trials consolidating thousands of lawsuits. Last year a Los Angeles judge ruled that the platforms’ design features may be responsible for harm – and not just the third-party content posted on sites and apps.\n\nHistorically, tech firms have turned to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law underpinning US internet regulation that exempts platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users, as part of their legal defence. The first bellwether case is still due to begin on 27 January with jury selection.\n\nSnap remains a defendant in the other two cases.\n\nBeasley Allen, a law firm involved in the lawsuits on the plaintiff side, has said the cases could have profound consequences including billions of dollars in damages, forcing changes in platform design and new US regulations governing how tech firms interact with minors.\n\n“The litigation is being compared to past landmark cases against big tobacco and opioid manufacturers – industries that were held accountable for public health harms after years of denial,” the firm said in a statement last year.\n\nSnap, Meta, TikTok and YouTube have been contacted for comment.",

    "title": "How to Kill a Fish",
    "description": "The Japanese chef Junya Yamasaki mastered a butchery technique that results in tastier seafood—and he’s taught some Southern California fishermen how to do it, too.",
    "fullText": "The method is considered significantly more humane than the standard alternatives for killing a fish (thwacking it on the head, letting it suffocate), and is analogous to halal and kosher butchery, which both require that animals be slaughtered with a swift, decisive cut to the throat. It also results in fish that tastes better and stays fresh significantly longer. “The process brings out the best characteristic of every species,” Yamasaki told me—a firm silkiness for white fish, a clean acidity for tuna. It works in part by stemming the flood of stress hormones and other chemicals that a fish’s body begins to release upon capture, staving off rigor mortis and the stink of decay. Conner Mitchell, a restaurateur and a commercial fisherman, and the captain of the Jamaica Day—the small pilothouse boat we were fishing on—was impressed the first time he saw Yamasaki do it. “I’m looking at a fish that would have been stiff, now as flexible as tissue paper,” Mitchell said.\n\nIn Japan, you can assume that the fish at any good restaurant met its end by way of ike and shinkei jime; in the U.S., the same is true at restaurants offering catch imported from Tokyo’s famed Toyosu Market. Among the fishermen of Southern California, the practice can largely be traced to Yamasaki, whose evangelism has quietly transformed the local seafood supply. On the deck of the Jamaica Day, Mitchell and an array of other energetic restaurant-industry dudes in their thirties—all of whom learned the technique under Yamasaki’s tutelage—set up rods, checked the boat’s radar, and gleefully spotted clusters of birds diving in the distance, which signalled that schools of bonito swam beneath them. Whenever a line began to jerk, the group exploded in a joyful chorus. Then the men took turns reeling the fish in, and putting them out of their misery.\n\nTwice, I reeled in a bonito myself—a process that I found surprisingly intimate, just me and an invisible squirming weight at the other end of the line. Both times, I struggled as I turned the crank, heart pounding, almost certain that I wouldn’t succeed, until I caught sight of a silver flash at the water’s surface. Then Danny Miller or Cole Moser—a chef and a bartender, respectively—would pull it on board. As Miller gutted one particularly beautiful specimen, tossing its organs into the spray before slipping it into a slurry of ice and salt water, he pointed out that, because of the ike and shinkei jime, the fish had retained its vibrant color. If it had died slowly, it would have already gone dull and gray.",
