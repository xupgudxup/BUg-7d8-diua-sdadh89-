    "description": "It's been a busy week for industry speculation after Geoff Keighley started posting about a mysterious, glowing monolith in the middle of the California desert, which was later moved into Los Angeles. Now, it appears the monolith's mystery might have just been solved through a trademark filing.\nRumors that the monolith was erected to tease new Diablo 4 content, Elder Scrolls 6, God of War, or Lords of the Fallen 2 were all shot down by people in the know. While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian.\nA trio of trademark filings were spotted up by MP1st, including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith.",

Faury said a widebody aircraft would be \"better suited\" for the concept.\n\nHe added that the BWB benefits come with trade-offs, including the possibility of eliminating windows.

    "title": "How a surreal California road inspired the car-chase scene in 'One Battle After Another'",
    "description": "Paul Thomas Anderson's movie \"One Battle After Another\" has a thrilling car-chase scene that was filmed on location in California.",
    "fullText": "\"One Battle After Another\" production designer Florencia Martin was driving near the California-Arizona border with director Paul Thomas Anderson on a location scout when they came across a unique stretch of road.\n\nAfter miles and miles of flat roadway cut through the middle of the desert, the topography was suddenly rocky, and the road's dips became so dramatic that they looked like big concrete waves stretching as far as the eye could see.\n\n\"Paul took out his phone and started recording out the car window,\" Martin told Business Insider.\n\nNo one in the car knew it yet, but they'd just found the thrilling ending to their movie.\n\nAnderson's latest epic, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an ex-revolutionary who is forced back into the cause to save his daughter Willa (Chase Infiniti) from a deranged military officer (Sean Penn), ends with a tense car-chase scene in which the contours of the road play a key role.\n\nThat only happened because of a stroke of luck. The movie's location manager, Michael Glaser, had taken Martin and Anderson on a three-hour drive from Los Angeles to Blythe, California, to scout a spot for the revolutionaries' camp. On the ride back to LA, they took a different route — one that sent them through a stretch of road outside Borrego Springs, California, that locals call \"The Texas Dip\" for the enormity of its drops.\n\nSoon after that trip, Martin received a new version of the script from Anderson in which the car chase scene ended on \"The Texas Dip.\"\n\nThe thrilling sequence, in which Infiniti's Willa outsmarts an assassin using the road's hills and the angle of the sun, wasn't easy to shoot. The team had scouted the location in the winter, but shot the scene in the summer, so they had to adjust their shooting schedule based on the sun's direction on the road at that time of year. And then there was the unforgiving environment.\n\n\"It was 110 degrees, people had heat exhaustion, there was wind, the dirt would get into the camera and jam it,\" said Martin, whose credits include 2022's \"Babylon\" and Anderson's 2021 movie \"Licorice Pizza.\" \"It was the harshest conditions you could imagine.\"\n\nIt was all worth it once Martin saw the car chase sequence for the first time with an audience.\n\n\"People actually gasped when watching it,\" she said. \"What's special about the way Paul works and being in these locations is you feel it on screen, the dirt on Willa's face, feeling the heat come off the road.\"\n\nMartin still can't believe the sequence is being compared to classic car-chase scenes in movie history.\n\n\"The fact that our movie is compared to movies we've watched like \"The French Connection\" and \"Vanishing Point,\" that are iconic, it's a huge honor,\" she said.\n\n\"One Battle After Another\" is now playing in theaters.",

The long-term vision includes running these aircraft on hydrogen rather than traditional jet fuel.\n\nBut despite the early momentum, Airbus has pushed its initial ZEROe 2035 timeline by as much as 10 years.\n\nAirbus has cited challenges surrounding certification complexity, limited global hydrogen infrastructure, and uncertainty around passenger acceptance — especially when some seats could be positioned far from natural light.\n\nStill, the BWB race is far from just an Airbus effort.\n\nAviation startups like Natilus and JetZero are betting that the unconventional BWB shape could help crack the traditional Boeing-Airbus duopoly, with both targeting launches in the early 2030s.\n\nSan Diego-based Natilus is developing a narrowbody version called Horizon to rival the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, promising about 25% lower fuel burn but 40% more cabin space. And it can fit into existing airport infrastructure.\n\nCompany CEO Aleksey Matyushev previously told Business Insider that the industry could face a shortfall of roughly 40,000 narrowbody jets over the next 20 years — a number he said is far more than the two legacy players can realistically supply.\n\nMatyushev added that Horizon's larger cabin footprint could allow for wider seats, dedicated family areas, and other special features that go beyond what today's narrowbody jets offer.\n\nRenderings of Horizon's proposed cabin, released in July, show up to three aisles instead of the traditional one or two. Matyushev confirmed to Business Insider that the jet will have windows throughout.\n\nPassengers in the center seats will still be farther from the windows, but Natilus said it is adding skylights and other lighting strategies to mimic the outside.\n\nMeanwhile, 100 miles north in Long Beach, JetZero is pursuing a widebody version called the \"Z4\" that promises up to 50% lower fuel burn and could replace jets like the Boeing 767 and Airbus A330.\n\nThe plane would have similar advantages to Horizon in terms of airport compatibility and seat layout.\n\nJetZero has already attracted interest from United Airlines. In April, United Airlines Ventures, the division that invests in these innovative aircraft, said it planned to buy up to 200 of JetZero's 250-seat Z4s.\n\nManaging director Andrew Chang previously told Business Insider that the aircraft's expansive interior could be game changer that feels like a \"living room in the sky.\"\n\nJetZero successfully flew a subscale prototype called Pathfinder in 2024.",

    "fullText": "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts bizarrely lost the ball twice during the same play as the reigning Super Bowl champions slumped to a third successive defeat on Monday.\n\nThe incident happened in the second quarter when Hurts was intercepted by the Los Angeles Chargers' Da'Shawn Hand. The defensive linesman then fumbled the ball and Hurts gathered it up, only to then lose the ball again when he was tackled.\n\nReports from the US indicate it is the first time since records of this nature began in 1978 that a player has turned the ball over twice on the same play.\n\nIt was a chastening game for Hurts who threw a career-high four interceptions at the SoFi Stadium in California, the final one coming when Tony Jefferson picked off a pass at the one-yard line to end the game in overtime.\n\nCameron Dicker had earlier kicked what turned out to be the game-winning 54-yard field goal in the extra period - matching his career-high five field goals in a single game - as the Chargers won 22-19.\n\nChargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who played after undergoing surgery on a fractured hand on 1 December, completed 12 of 26 passes for 139 yards.\n\nA fifth victory in their past six outings leaves the Chargers second in the AFC West, while the Eagles remain top of the NFC East.\n\nBoth sides return to action on 14 December at 20:00 GMT, with the Chargers travelling to the Kansas City Chiefs and the Eagles hosting the Las Vegas Raiders.",
