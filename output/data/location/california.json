    "fullText": "Jan 26 (Reuters) - Attorneys for Meta Platforms and other social media companies asked a California federal judge on Monday to block several school districts from taking their lawsuits against the companies to trial, arguing that federal law protects them from claims they ​knowingly addicted young users.\n\nAt a hearing before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, lawyers for the companies clashed with counsel ‌for six school districts from states across the country, who argue the platforms' design has harmed students' mental health and forced districts to spend money and staff time to address the fallout.\n\nThe companies urged ‌the judge to rule that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally shields platforms like Meta's Facebook and Instagram from liability over user-generated content, bars the cases from proceeding to the first trials in federal court over the claims.\n\nJonathan Blavin, an attorney for the social media companies, said the schools’ allegations rely on evidence that includes such content, placing the claims within the protections of Section 230.\n\n\"If that evidence is entirely excluded, I think the record here is incredibly thin,\" Blavin said. \"It's just ⁠not there.\"\n\nLawyers for the school districts countered that their ‌claims are not based on user-content but on platform features they say are intentionally designed to keep young people on the social media sites as long as possible.\n\nAndre Mura, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said their experts had examined broad studies of ‍students who had used social media to support their findings that it had harmed them.\n\n“The literature shows the increase in the risk of harm is not based on content,” he said.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS IN STATE, FEDERAL COURT\n\nMeta, Snapchat and parent Snap Inc., YouTube and parent Alphabet Inc., and TikTok and parent ByteDance are facing thousands of lawsuits in both federal and ​state court over claims they knowingly designed their platforms to have features that addict children and teens, fueling a mental health crisis.\n\nThe first trial testing ‌the claims in state court is slated for this week in Los Angeles.\n\nThe federal cases have been consolidated into multidistrict litigation before Rogers and include lawsuits brought by families, school districts and state governments.\n\nMonday's hearing focused only on cases filed by school districts, which claim they have been hurt financially from having to manage student mental health issues and social problems like cyberbullying. Rogers is considering whether to enter judgment for the companies in six of those lawsuits, selected as so-called \"bellwether\" or test cases, ahead of the first trials in federal court, currently scheduled to begin in June.\n\nBellwether trials are used to gauge how juries may respond to similar ⁠claims and help establish settlement values for the other similar cases in the litigation.\n\nIn rulings ​on the companies’ motions to dismiss in 2023 and 2024, Rogers said the cases could go ​forward, but Section 230 limited many of their claims, including some about specific features of the platforms.\n\nOn Monday, Rogers agreed that the plaintiffs had a lot of evidence that seemed to be based on content and said that should the cases go forward, there ‍would be a lengthy debate about what ⁠could be shown to the juries.\n\nBut even if the actual content played some role, Rogers said that juries were often asked to examine a problem with several causes and determine which were primarily to blame.\n\n“It’s not like we have a white and a yolk, it’s all scrambled together,” Rogers ⁠said. “That’s a very common circumstance. Why should this be any different?”\n\nThe case is In Re: Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District ‌of California, No. 4:22-md-03047.\n\nFor plaintiffs: Andre Mura of Gibbs Mura; Previn Warren of Motley Rice\n\nFor defendants: Jonathan Blavin of Munger Tolles & Olson; ‌Ashley Hardin of Williams & Connolly; Christian Pistilli of Covington & Burling",

    "description": "California has hailed itself as a leader in single-use plastic reduction and legislation. But a scuttling of its pioneering law, and a new report on the dismal state of recycling in the state, shows things aren't so green in the Golden State.",
    "fullText": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nCalifornia touts itself as a leader on the problem of plastic garbage, but recent developments suggest otherwise.\n\nA new report issued by the state’s waste agency shows plastic yogurt containers, shampoo bottles and restaurant takeout trays are being recycled at rates only in the single digits.\n\nPolypropylene, labeled as #5 on packaging, is used for yogurt containers, margarine tubs and microwavable trays. Only 2% of it is getting recycled. Colored shampoo and detergent bottles, made from polyethylene, or #1 plastic, are getting recycled at a rate of just 5%.\n\nOther plastics, including ones promoted as highly recyclable, such as clear polyethylene bottles, which hold some medications, or hard water bottles, are being recycled at just 16%.\n\nNo plastic in the report exceeds a recycling rate of 23%, with the majority reported in just the single digits.\n\nAdding to this disquieting assessment, CalRecycle also just pulled back regulations that were supposed to finalize a landmark single-use plastic law known as Senate Bill 54 — a law designed to make the majority of packaging waste in the state recyclable or compostable by working with the plastic and packaging industries.\n\nThe report and delay have sparked a wide variety of reactions by those who have closely watched the law as it was written and implemented.\n\nThe proposed regulations were regarded as friendly to industry. As a result, some are hopeful that CalRecycle’s decision to pull them back for tweaking means the agency will make the law stronger. Others say the two developments just show the state has never really been serious about plastic recycling.\n\n“California’s SB 54 ... will NEVER increase the recycling rates of these items ... because cartons and plastic packaging are fundamentally not technically or economically recyclable,” said Jan Dell, the founder of Orange County-based Last Beach Cleanup, an anti-plastic organization.\n\nIndustry representatives are also expressing disappointment, saying the more delays and changes the state makes, the harder it is “for California businesses to comply with the law and implement the resulting changes,” said John Myers, a spokesman for the California Chamber of Commerce, which represents companies that will be affected.\n\nReports on abysmally low rates of recycling for milk cartons and polystyrene have been widely shared and known. But the newest numbers were still a grim confirmation that there are few options for dealing with these materials.\n\nAccording to one state analysis, 2.9 million tons of single-use plastic and 171.4 billion single-use plastic components were sold, offered for sale or distributed in California in 2023.\n\nSingle-use plastics and plastic waste more broadly are considered a growing environmental and health problem. In recent decades, plastic waste has overwhelmed waterways and oceans, sickening marine life and threatening human health.\n\nLast spring, the Newsom administration was accused of neutering the regulations that CalRecycle had initially proposed to implement the law. The changes excluded all packaging material related to produce, meat, dairy products, dog food, toothpaste, condoms, shampoo and cereal boxes, among other products. These are all products that might fall under the purview of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nIt also opened the door to “alternative” recycling, such as chemical recycling, which environmentalists say is polluting, and was banned in the language of the law.\n\nThe waste agency then submitted those draft regulations to the Office of Administrative Law, whose lawyers and staff review proposed regulations to ensure they are “clear, necessary, legally valid, and available to the public” before finalizing them. They were set to release their determination on Friday; CalRecycle pulled the regulations back before the office issued its determination.\n\nNeither the law office nor governor’s office responded to requests for comment.\n\nMelanie Turner, CalRecycle’s spokeswoman, said the agency withdrew its proposed regulations “to make changes ... to improve clarity and support successful implementation of the law,” and its revisions were focused on areas that dealt with “food and agricultural commodities.”\n\nCalifornia state Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), author of the original legislation, called the delay “entirely avoidable” in a statement, but said it would allow CalRecycle an “opportunity to ensure the regulations truly follow the law as it was signed.”\n\nHe urged the waste agency and Newsom’s administration not to “allow broad, sweeping exemptions that would undermine the program and increase costs for ratepayers.”\n\nCritics of the watered-down regulations, such as Anja Brandon, the director of plastics policy for the Ocean Conservancy, said she wasn’t surprised by the withdrawal.\n\nThe proposed regulations “would have gone beyond CalRecycle’s authority by creating a sweeping categorical exclusion for food and agricultural packaging — effectively a loophole that would have allowed producers to continue putting vast amounts of plastic packaging into the marketplace, completely undermining SB 54’s goals and success,” she said in a text message.\n\nTurner said CalRecycle will conduct a 15-day comment period — although when that begins has not yet been divulged.",

    "fullText": "World number one Scottie Scheffler launched his 2026 US PGA Tour campaign with a runaway victory in the American Express at La Quinta, California.\n\nScheffler, whose 2025 season included two major titles among six victories, piled up nine birdies in a six-under par 66 on the Stadium Course, where even a double-bogey at the 17th was barely a blip on the way to a 27-under par total of 261 and a four-shot victory.\n\nAustralian veteran Jason Day climbed into a share of second with a superb eight-under par 64. He was joined on 265 by Americans Ryan Gerard, Matt McCarty and Andrew Putnam, Gerard posting a seven-under 65 and McCarty and Putnam each signing for a 68.\n\nScheffler, 29, became the first player since Tiger Woods to grab his 20th US PGA Tour title before the age of 30. He's off to his fifth straight season with at least one victory.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" Scheffler said. \"It was a challenging week. I did a good job of staying patient and executing when I needed to.\"\n\nScheffler, who hasn't missed a cut on the PGA Tour since August 2022, started the day one off the lead and opened with a birdie. He bogeyed the second before settling in with back-to-back birdies at four and five and another pair at seven and eight.\n\nHe added four more birdies coming in, his four-footer at the par-five 16th pushing him to 29-under.\n\nHe was in the water off the tee on the way to a double-bogey at the par-three 17th, but by then there was no catching him.\n\nOvernight leader Kim Si-woo of South Korea carded an even par 72 to tie for sixth on 22-under.\n\nTeenager Blades Brown, who started the day tied with Scheffler on 21-under, closed with a two-over 74 for a share of 18th.\n\nIt finished off a remarkable week for the 18-year-old from Tennessee, who tied for 17th in a Korn Ferry event in the Bahamas on Wednesday before a dash to California to tee it up on a sponsor's exemption.\n\nHe flirted with a 59 on Friday, when a 60 gave him a share of the halfway lead. He had a birdie chance at 18 for a share of 10th -- and a place in the Torrey Pines field.\n\nHe closed with a bogey but departed happy with his week.\n\n\"I could probably write a book about what I've learned these past couple of days,\" Brown said.\n\n\"Just knowing that I can compete out here. It was so cool watching Scottie win in person and getting to play with him.\n\n\"He's such an unbelievable guy. He talked to me numerous times throughout the round and was giving me a lot of encouragement, so it was awesome.\"",

He doesn’t look out of place at all among the regulars.\n\nThe final round will see him tee it up alongside Scottie Scheffler and Si Woo Kim—a massive opportunity for the teenager to test himself against established names.\n\nHe’s also shown plenty of composure throughout the week, playing smart and staying patient when things weren’t falling his way early on. That kind of maturity is rare for someone so new to this level.\n\nIf he can pull it off, he’ll become the youngest PGA Tour winner since Charles Kocsis won the 1931 Michigan Open—a remarkable feat for any player, let alone one still new to life on tour.\n\nJustin Rose has had a remarkable career, and his list of achievements speaks for itself.\n\nHis US Open title, Olympic gold medal, 26 professional wins, and seven Ryder Cup appearances highlight an impressive resume.\n\nThe 45-year-old has managed to stay relevant at the top level of the game for a long time, which is no small feat.\n\nBut his early days in professional golf were far from easy.\n\nAfter turning pro in 1998, he missed 21 straight cuts and struggled to find his footing on tour.\n\nRose made the leap into the pro ranks right after finishing T-4 at The Open Championship at Royal Birkdale in 1998.\n\nThat memorable hole-out on the final green is still fresh in many minds.\n\nRose began that Sunday fifth on the leaderboard and climbed to fourth with a strong round of 69 in very tough conditions.\n\nAfter shooting a 68 in Saturday’s third round of the American Express, Blades Brown finished the day tied for second and matched a 28-year PGA Tour record originally set by Justin Rose.\n\nHe’s now the first player aged 18 or younger to be inside the top five after three rounds of a PGA Tour event since Rose did it at The Open in 1998.\n\nJustin Ray, who is known for his detailed golf stats, shared this information on his official X account:\n\nBrown’s run at the American Express has been nothing short of remarkable.\n\nMatching a record that Justin Rose set nearly three decades ago really shows how well he’s played this week.",

    "description": "A millionaire in California shares why he supports the state's proposed billionaire wealth tax — and why he doesn't plan to move away.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Scott Ellis, a 55-year-old millionaire who lives in Silicon Valley, about California's proposed 5% billionaire wealth tax. Ellis is a member of Patriotic Millionaires, a collection of wealthy Americans who advocate for a fair tax system, a livable wage, and equal access to political power. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI never thought I'd live in California. I grew up in Colorado, went to college in Boston, and lived in Texas. I came out here for business school because I wanted to be at Stanford, and because you could play golf during the winter.\n\nNow I love it here. It has nothing to do with taxes; taxes have never been anywhere on our list of criteria for deciding where to live. I want to live where my family is and love the weather, the jobs, and the dynamism.\n\nTaxes are the price that we pay to live in a civil society. We have to do this together. There are examples all around the world of the power of effective government, and just like anything else, government needs to be funded. We should make it effective and efficient.\n\nI'm proud to pay the taxes I pay. I should pay taxes that are higher than other people because I have more wealth than other people — that makes sense.\n\nA lot of our financial success has been due to my wife's success, as well as mine at the beginning of our careers.\n\nI went to Harvard undergrad, worked at McKinsey for three years, and then went to Stanford. I then worked at Hewlett-Packard for almost eight years.\n\nIn 2007, my wife was a VP at Yahoo and we had two small kids. I looked at my boss's job, and at the CEO's job, and decided I didn't ever want those roles. I thought, \"Uh-oh, I'm on this ladder, and it's not really where I want to go.\"\n\nUltimately, my wife and I decided that I would step back and be the stay-at-home parent. My wife continued her career, and she's been very successful in consumer internet at Yahoo, Google, and Pinterest.\n\nI studied poverty, urban America, housing, transportation, and sociology in college, and started thinking more about questions like: What does fairness look like? What does justice look like? What would it look like to build a great society?\n\nI got busy pursuing my career, meeting my wife, and raising our kids, but as time passed and we progressed in our careers, I got back into thinking about how we help others around us. I did a bunch of volunteer work in different contexts, eventually becoming the COO and then the CSO of a nonprofit called New Teacher Center, which does intensive mentoring programs for new teachers.\n\nSince 2012, I've started and run several nonprofits in the education space, and advised almost 200 individuals and organizations on things like strategy, finance, operations, and culture.\n\nI'm also really focused on addressing excessive wealth and its impact on society and thinking about a future vision for American democracy, which is how I came to Patriotic Millionaires, an organization of wealthy Americans who advocate for higher taxes on wealthy people like ourselves, a higher minimum wage, and a broader distribution of political power across our society.\n\nIn recent years, I've been struck by the massive accumulation of wealth enabled by the consumer internet space, globalization, and the structure of the finance industry. It's different from what it used to be in the '80s and '90s; this is a whole new ballgame.\n\nMore recently, I've been looking around Silicon Valley at all these people who are so incredibly wealthy, talented, and successful, and realizing how few of them are thinking about choosing to build a better society together.\n\nThey're excited about starting new companies and raising new funds, but these are all people who have more money than they could ever spend, and their next goal is to generate even more money, mainly for people who already have more money than they could ever spend.\n\nMeanwhile, 10% of our society is in poverty. It really feels unfair and wrong, and we can do better.\n\nThe proposed billionaire wealth tax in California doesn't impact me and my family directly. People may think, \"You're happy to raise taxes on other people.\"\n\nBut we need to start with a different conversation, about how much wealth is enough, how much wealth is too much, and what is financial success?\n\nI believe that if you have $30 million in wealth, congratulations, you won capitalism. If you do the analysis of reasonable investment returns and inflation, you can buy a really nice first house, a nice second house, your kids' college is paid for, your end-of-life expenses are covered, and you have a very, very luxurious ongoing existence.\n\nSo much of success in life is luck. Yes, people absolutely get educated and work hard. But it's been found that the wealthier people are, the more they tend to attribute their wealth to how good they are and how hard they worked.\n\nI look at single moms working three jobs, working the night shift — a heck of a lot of people who have less than $190,000 [the median household wealth] in wealth are working very hard.\n\nOnce you get beyond $30 million — and almost no one ever gets there — you get to a point where your life is so good, you really can't materially improve your life anymore. We should implement a very aggressive annual 50% tax on all household wealth over $30 million. Excessive wealth turns into excessive power through huge campaign donations, which threatens and undermines democracy and capitalism.\n\nI'm absolutely delighted that we're moving in this direction, but I believe changes to wealth taxes need to happen at the federal level.\n\nWhen wealthy folks bring up moving out of California, it's a distraction. All of a sudden, instead of us talking about the fact that millions of people are going to be either losing healthcare or paying much more for healthcare, we're worried about the 200 really rich people who might move.\n\nPeople move all the time. Companies move all the time for all kinds of reasons — it's just part of business. These conversations happen all the time — like, \"Oh my gosh, there won't be any more companies in Silicon Valley.\" Well, 20 years later, look around. There are still some companies here; it's just fine.\n\nIt's 65 degrees and sunny here. The CEO of Nvidia recently said they'll be staying in California because that's where the talent is. We've got the Golden Gate Bridge, Hollywood, Tahoe, the Redwoods, the beach, and great weather. I'm really not worried that people aren't going to want to live in California.\n\nI love it here. My wife and I are thinking about living in different cities for maybe a month at a time, but I have no plans to go anywhere else. Although I definitely love Colorado — I still have my Denver Broncos coasters and will be cheering for my Broncos — I'm from Silicon Valley now, and that's where I'm going to stay.",

They did not reveal the person's identity.\n\nThe rescuers then returned to Lone Pine just before 6:00 p.m.\n\n“The incident occurred within Tulare County jurisdiction, and proper notification was made to the Tulare County Sheriff's Office,” Inyo County Search & Rescue continued.\n\nThe news comes after the body of a missing 21-year-old hiker was recovered on Mount Whitney, Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nPEOPLE also previously reported that a father of two died after falling from a trail while climbing Mount Whitney in October.\n\nIn their recent statement, the Inyo County Search & Rescue said the “recent fatalities on Mount Whitney and Mount Baldy, serves as a reminder that winter ascents are serious mountaineering endeavors, not hikes.”\n\n“Winter conditions leave little margin for error, and the consequences can be severe,” they added. “Additionally, many fatalities occur when individuals travel solo or when groups separate.”\n\nThey went on to say that the safety concerns of a person in a group “ should be taken seriously.”\n\n“Fatigue is also a critical contributing factor,” they added. “Extended periods of exertion negatively impact decision-making and increase the likelihood of missteps and falls. Knowing when to turn around can save lives.\"\n\nThe statement from rescuers concluded, “Please be respectful in your comments. The victim’s family and friends may be following this post, and some comments may be hurtful. Thank you!”\n\nMount Whitney is the tallest mountain in the contiguous U.S., according to the National Park Service’s website. The elevation at the summit is reported to be 14,505 feet.",

    "fullText": "Teenager Blades Brown fired a spectacular 12-under par 60 to join world number one Scottie Scheffler atop the leaderboard after two rounds of the PGA Tour American Express in La Quinta, California, on Friday.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Tennessee just missed out on a 59 when his birdie putt at his final hole slipped by on the right side.\n\n\"I'm so stoked to have shot 60 on the PGA Tour,\" Brown said, acknowledging that nerves \"absolutely\" kicked in over the final three holes.\n\nHe had made a dazzling start on the Nicklaus Tournament course, one of three in use over the first three rounds of the event.\n\nBrown, who made his pro debut at La Quinta last year, teed off on 10 and was eight under through his first seven holes thanks to an eagle and six birdies.\n\nAfter a birdie at the second he strung together three more at the fourth, fifth and sixth to reach 12-under for the day.\n\nHe couldn't capitalize on the par-five seventh, settling for a par after his second shot found the rough.\n\nAfter a par at the eighth he had one more chance at the 16th sub-60 round ever on the PGA Tour at the par-four ninth, where a mammoth drive and a crisp wedge left him a birdie look from inside seven feet that he couldn't convert.\n\n\"I saw my spot just a little before the hole,\" he said. \"I got a great read off David Ford. He dripped it in there and it went right dead center. So I was thinking, OK, maybe just a little outside right edge.\n\n\"Unfortunately it didn't go in, but I'm really happy with the outcome I had today.\"\n\nIt was the continuation of a whirlwind week for Brown, who finished tied for 17th in the Korn Ferry developmental tour event in the Bahamas on Wednesday, then, with a sponsor's exemption to play in La Quinta, made his way to California in time to tee it up on Thursday.\n\nHe goes into the weekend tied on 17-under 127 with Scheffler, who had eight birdies in his eight-under 64 on the Nicklaus Tournament course.\n\nScheffler is making his season debut after a 2025 campaign that included two major titles among his six wins.\n\nThrilled to have his name next to Scheffler's atop the leaderboard, Brown wasn't getting ahead of himself.\n\n\"We're halfway there. We've got a lot of golf to go,\" he said, adding that his next order of business would be getting some rest.\n\n\"I'm going to go take a nap,\" Brown said.\n\nThe leading duo were one stroke clear of South Korean Kim Si-Woo, who posted a 65 on the tougher Stadium Course for a 16-under total of 128.\n\nIt was a further stroke back to South Korea's Kim Seong-hyeon and American Matt McCarty.\n\nAmerican Andrew Putnam also flirted with a 59 before settling for a 12-under 60 on the La Quinta course that left him 12-under for the tournament.",

    "description": "Ryan Wedding turned himself in at US consulate in Mexico City and is due to appear in court in California on Monday",
    "fullText": "Ryan Wedding, the Canadian Olympic snowboarder turned alleged drug kingpin, has been arrested after turning himself in at the US embassy in Mexico, law enforcement officials announced on Friday.\n\nWedding, 44, had been sought by the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for his role in overseeing what the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, called the “one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations” in the world.\n\n“He thought he could evade justice … here we are today, bringing him to justice,” the FBI director, Kash Patel, said from an airfield in California, calling Wedding the “largest narco-trafficker in modern times”.\n\nMexico’s security minister, Omar García Harfuch, said that Wedding “surrendered voluntarily” at the US embassy in Mexico City on Wednesday after evading police for nearly a decade.\n\nWedding was flown from Mexico to California and is custody. He is due to appear in court on Monday in California. He is charged with drug trafficking, conspiracy to murder, witness tampering and money laundering.\n\nOfficials in the US allege that Wedding’s organisation had moved nearly 60 metric tons of cocaine a year into Los Angeles from Mexico using a network of semitrucks. Wedding is also accused of ordering the killing of a key FBI witness as well as several other murders, including that of a couple who were killed in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nSince 2023, the RCMP and the FBI have been collaborating on a sprawling investigation known as Operation Giant Slalom. In March, 2025, Wedding was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted List.\n\n“We told you in November we would find Mr Wedding. Today, that day has arrived,” said Akil Davis, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office. “The long arm of the law extends beyond our border.”\n\nDavid said the arrest was a “good day” for victims. “Ryan Wedding tormented several people and several families that will never be the same,” he said. “But today, they get the justice that they sought.”\n\nDavis said in addition to “crushing sanctions” against 19 people, including Wedding, authorities also seized a Mercedes sports car worth $15m and motorcycles worth $40m.\n\nUS authorities had previously said that they believed Wedding to be in hiding in Mexico. On Thursday, Patel was in Mexico City for what he called “pre-planned” meetings with the country’s security chief, García Harfuch. And on Friday morning he left with a souvenir: Ryan Wedding, and another, unnamed, “priority objective”.\n\nThe decision for an FBI director to be present in the field for an arrest is exceedingly rare and speaks to the political focus on capturing Wedding.\n\nGarcía Harfuch released a statement saying that Patel was leaving with “a non-US citizen who was arrested by Mexican authorities and is among the FBI’s 10 most wanted, and a Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered yesterday at the US embassy”.\n\n“If it’s true that he handed himself in, this may be an attempt to negotiate better terms,” said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, an analyst with the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime. “Maybe it gives him a little more room for manoeuvre.”\n\nOr there could be another explanation: he feared for his safety in Mexico, said Farfán-Méndez.\n\nThe arrest comes at a time of tension in North America, with Mark Carney and Donald Trump clashing at Davos, and renewed threats of US military strikes on Mexican cartel targets.\n\n“There was a message from the secretary of state, talking about the need for tangible results [against organised crime],” said Farfán-Méndez. “I think grabbing Ryan Wedding is a very media-friendly way to show tangible results. I think it could be filed under that column.”\n\nAlejandro Rosales Castillo, one of the FBI’s 10 most wanted fugitives, who is accused of the murder of a woman in North Carolina in 2016, was also arrested. A US citizen, he crossed the border to Mexico in 2017 and was in hiding for almost a decade until he was captured in Pachuca, Hidalgo, on 16 January.\n\nNBC News first announced news of the arrest and US law enforcement officials familiar with the operation confirmed it to the Guardian.\n\nIn March, the FBI announced a $15m reward for the capture of Wedding, whose nicknames include “Public Enemy”, “El Jefe” and “Giant”.\n\nAt the time,Patel, compared Wedding to Pablo Escobar and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.\n\nThe head of the RCMP, Michael Duheme was also present at the announcement and said “no single country” can break up transnational drug-trafficking organizations.\n\nWedding was allegedly being protected by the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico while he was on the run.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that Wedding’s significance in the international drug trade had been exaggerated by US authorities and the media.\n\n“There’s been a high-level characterisation of Wedding as a major kingpin. There was a $15m reward for him. At least from a media standpoint, he was a big fish,” said Farfán-Méndez. “But I think the indictment gives a different sense of proportion.”\n\nThough US authorities claim Wedding’s enterprise was trafficking 60 tonnes of cocaine a year, this figure does not appear in the indictment, which only mentions specific cases of a few hundred kilos being moved at a time.\n\n“These arrests are important for law enforcement,” said Farfán-Méndez. “But whether they impact [drug] supply is another question.”",

    "title": "Tesla discontinues Autopilot to boost adoption of its Full Self-Driving software",
    "description": "The company is also currently facing a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in California for deceptive marketing about Autopilot's capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Tesla has discontinued Autopilot, its basic driver-assistance system, as the company tries to boost adoption of a more advanced version of the technology that it calls Full Self-Driving (Supervised).\n\nThe decision comes as the company faces a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in its largest U.S. market, California. A judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD for years. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which originally brought the case and has a say over the licenses, stayed the ruling for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply by dropping the Autopilot name.\n\nAutopilot was a combination of Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which sticks to a designated speed while maintaining distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a lane-centering feature that could steer the car around curves.\n\nTesla’s online configuration site now states new cars now come standard with only Traffic Aware Cruise Control. It’s not clear if current customers are affected.\n\nThe decision comes one week after the company said that starting on February 14, it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software. After that, customers will only be able to access FSD through a monthly subscription of $99 — though Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a post on Thursday that the subscription price will increase as the software’s capabilities improve.\n\nMusk believes that Tesla’s newer cars will be capable of “unsupervised” driving, saying FSD advances will allow drivers to “be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride.” In December, he said a new version of FSD allowed the former, though texting while driving is illegal in almost all states.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla rolled out the first robotaxi versions of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, that have no human safety personnel in the cars. Those vehicles are running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software and are still followed by the company’s cars for supervision.\n\nTesla launched the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software in late 2020, but adoption has always lagged behind the expectations of executives like Musk. In October 2025, Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said only 12% of all Tesla customers had paid for the software. Hitting “10 million active FSD subscriptions” by 2035 is one of the key “product goals” required for Musk to receive the full payout of his new $1 trillion pay package. \n\nTesla first introduced Autopilot in the early 2010s after talks broke down between Musk and Google to leverage the tech being developed by the search giant’s then-nascent autonomous driving division (which eventually got spun out into Waymo). Tesla made the driver-assistance system standard on all of its vehicles in April 2019.\n\nAcross the decade-plus of Autopilot’s existence, Tesla struggled with communicating the software’s capabilities. The company often overpromised and made the tech seem more capable than it was, leading some drivers to become overly confident in its abilities, which in turn led to hundreds of crashes and at least 13 fatalities, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump lashed out at Gavin Newsom for spoiling his appearance at the Davos, Switzerland, summit this week.\n\nThe California governor attended the forum, spending his time criticizing the president and his administration while urging allies to “stand united.” At one point, the 58-year-old claimed he was denied entry into the U.S. hub.\n\nNewsom looked on as Trump addressed political and business leaders on Wednesday, then criticized the president’s “boring, and at times boorish,” speech.\n\n“It was insignificant in its insignificance. He said what we all knew: that he’s not going to invade Greenland,” he told The Guardian.\n\nTrump, who has backed down from his threat of military invasion and tariffs on other European nations, still couldn’t seem to get over Newsom’s appearance.\n\n“Gavin Newscum, as a “Lame Duck” Governor of a Failing State, should not be at Davos running around screaming for the attention of Foreign Leaders, and embarrassing our Country,“ Trump, 79, grumbled on Truth Social. “He made a mockery of himself, and everybody, including his staff, knows it!”\n\nTrump went on to attack the governor, who is term-limited and cannot run for re-election in 2028, on California-specific issues.\n\n“With a record like he’s got,” Trump concluded, “the ruination of one of the most beautiful places on Earth, where people are leaving in droves, it is unimaginable that he could run for President but, who knows, it’s a very strange World!”\n\nNewsom, 58, responded succinctly to Trump’s 158-word attack.\n\nNewsom also took shots at Trump’s backers who followed the president’s lead in criticizing him.\n\nWhen radio host Bill Mitchell captioned a photo of Newsom, “That look you have when you’re not winning and you know it,” the Democrat fired back: “That look when every MAGA doormat can’t stop talking about you.”\n\nIt was only a matter of time before White House Communications Director Steven Cheung got involved.\n\nCheung, who recently went after Newsom for criticizing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and world leaders at Davos who suck up to Trump, gave his own caption of Newsom’s photo.\n\n“The look of someone who realizes they’re at the point of no return and giving up control to others is the only way to satisfy his home life,” he wrote on X.\n\nThe Newsom bashing continued into the night on Fox News.\n\nWhile Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick did some pearl-clutching about Newsom selling kneepads with Trump’s signature, Katie Miller, the wife of Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, suggested that there was a large amount of voting and welfare fraud happening in his state, and complained that Newsom “still hasn’t turned over his voter rolls or welfare list to us.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted Newsom’s office and the White House for comment.\n\nPreviously, the White House told the Daily Beast, “No one in Davos knows who third-rate governor Newscum is or why he is frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.”",

    "description": "At Davos, the California governor criticized Trump, was blocked from the US pavilion, traded insults, waved kneepads, and fueled 2028 speculation.",
    "fullText": "Gavin Newsom's return to Davos was always going to be loud. It just wasn't clear how chaotic it would get.\n\nOver the course of a few days in the Swiss Alps, the California governor criticized President Donald Trump, was denied entry to the USA House, waved red kneepads at corporate leaders, and traded insults with Trump's Treasury secretary.\n\nNewsom had framed his attendance at the World Economic Forum as a direct challenge to Trump on the global stage.\n\nLast week, his office said he planned to rebut the president's economic agenda, defend \"democratic capitalism,\" and position California as a counterweight to what he called Trump's \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nTrump spoke first, addressing business and political leaders on Wednesday morning. Newsom, watching from the room, criticized the speech shortly afterward.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, including Business Insider's Ben Bergman, Newsom said the audience reaction was muted because Trump spoke down to people, adding that \"had there not been cellphones, I think a few people would have passed out from boredom.\"\n\nAnna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, later dismissed Newsom as a \"third-rate governor\" in comments to Business Insider, saying that it was unclear why he was \"frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.\"\n\nTensions escalated hours later on Wednesday when Newsom was denied entry to the USA House, the official US pavilion at Davos, where he was scheduled to talk in a fireside chat hosted by Fortune.\n\nNewsom's office said the invitation was rescinded at the last minute due to pressure from the White House and State Department.\n\nNewsom blasted the move on X, calling it \"weak and pathetic\" to block a fireside chat. His office said that multiple Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, had spoken at the pavilion earlier that day.\n\nBessent, for his part, didn't hold back. He publicly called Newsom \"economically illiterate,\" \"smug,\" and \"too self-absorbed,\" escalating what had already become a personal feud playing out in front of the global business elite.\n\nNewsom got his biggest moment on Thursday during another scheduled Davos appearance.\n\nIn an onstage interview with Semafor's Ben Smith, he said that the US was no longer governed by the rule of law but by what he called \"the rule of Don,\" accusing Congress, universities, law firms, and corporate leaders of bending the knee to the president.\n\nTo make the point, Newsom brought in bright red kneepads — a prop meant to symbolize corporate capitulation — drawing applause from the audience.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, acknowledged Newsom in his own Davos remarks on Wednesday. \"We're going to help the people in California,\" Trump said. \"We want to have no crime. I know Gavin was here. I used to get along so great with Gavin when I was president. Gavin is a good guy.\"\n\nThe governor declined a later invitation to return to the USA House for a private nightcap reception.\n\nPolitical experts told Business Insider that Newsom's return to Davos signals ambitions beyond California.\n\nHis decision to confront Trump in front of global business and political leaders has renewed speculation that he is laying the groundwork for a potential 2028 presidential bid.",

He will be back in Texas before the storm is projected to hit,” a spokesperson for the senator said in a statement, first shared with KHOU.\n\nMultiple critics invoked another moment from Cruz’s career where he went viral and earned plenty of mockery. In February 2021, Cruz was heavily criticized after took a trip to Cancun, Mexico, while Texas was hit with the deadly Winter Storm Uri.\n\nThe senator returned to Texas at the time and admitted his trip was “obviously a mistake.”\n\n“It was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it,” he said.\n\nThe latest storm is expected to stretch across 2,000 miles eventually, while it’ll begin in Texas and Oklahoma. Heavy snowfall and freezing rain are expected to begin Friday, hitting northern Texas and cities like Dallas and Houston. The storm will eventually move its way to the East Coast.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott (R) has declared a state of emergency in his state over the approaching harsh weather.\n\n“Based on current forecasts, the State of Texas is acting to ensure Texans have the resources they need before severe winter weather impacts communities across Texas,” the governor announced this week. “I thank emergency management personnel and first responders for working tirelessly to keep Texans safe.”\n\nThe post Ted Cruz Bites Back at Critics Furious Over His Leaving Texas Ahead of Major Winter Storm first appeared on Mediaite.",

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nThe Suns entered Wednesday’s matchup coming off a 113-108 loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors on Monday. With rookies Rasheer Fleming and Khaman Maluach, along with two-way player Jamaree Bouyea, assigned back to the team, the Valley hoped the trio would provide the spark needed to get back on track.\n\nFleming and Maluach had been traveling with the Phoenix Suns throughout the six-game road trip, earning minutes whenever the team needed them. Bouyea is coming off concussion protocol and has not played since early January.\n\nHowever, Wednesday’s game allowed the rookies to flourish with increased playing time.\n\nOct 24, 2025; Inglewood, California, USA; Los Angeles Clippers center Yanic Konan Niederhauser (14) defends Phoenix Suns center Khaman Maluach (10) in the second half at Intuit Dome.

Maluach added eight points and six rebounds but dealt with foul trouble, picking up three fouls before halftime. Bouyea struggled early but found a rhythm late in the half, finishing with nine points, two rebounds, and two assists at the break.\n\nDespite limited minutes, Bouyea’s strong finish to the first half suggested he was simply shaking off rust.\n\nThe Suns opened the second half on an 18-0 run, partly by Bouyea’s eight points. He finished the night with 27 points, while Fleming finished with 19 points and Maluach finished with 23.\n\nNov 24, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Rasheer Fleming (20) against the Houston Rockets at Mortgage Matchup Center.

Head coach Paul Jesperson acknowledged their earlier game struggles, especially Bouyea, as Wednesday was his first official night in a Valley Suns uniform.\n\n“We knew there was probably going to be a little fatigue there and a little bit of those guys just having to feel the game out a little bit as it progressed,” he said post-game. “I think [Bouyea] did exactly that. Kind of found his spots, got comfort level [and] got a little energy to him.”\n\nThe Suns finish out the week with a matchup against the Texas Legends on the road on Friday, Jan. 23, at 6:30 p.m.\n\nWM Phoenix Open brings golf to streetwear with Samba shoe collab",

According to Bloomberg, Sacks is a billionaire and thus could have been subject to the tax.\n\nWhile the proposal is limited, Sacks said it would just be the beginning.\n\n\"It's not a one-time. It's a first time,\" he said. \"And if they get away with it, there'll be a second time and a third time. And this will be the beginning of something very new and different in this country.\"\n\nIf passed, California residents with a net worth of over $1.1 billion would face a one-time tax totalling 5% of their assets. (Residents with a net worth between $1 billion and $1.1 billion would pay a smaller tax.)\n\nGoogle cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin moved entities tied to them out of California ahead of the deadline. Other billionaires, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have said they won't leave the state.\n\nThe tax has yet to be approved. Supporters are still gathering enough signatures to put the issue before California voters this November. If they meet that threshold, a majority of voters would then need to support it. It's likely legal challenges would ensue as well.\n\nSacks said Gov. Gavin Newsom deserves blame for the current situation for not opposing the tax sooner and \"vocally\" enough.\n\nTara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Newsom's office, pointed to the governor's history of questioning earlier wealth tax proposals going back to 2020.\n\n\"Clearly, David Sacks didn't know what he was talking about,\" she said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nIn recent weeks, Newsom has continued to step up his opposition to such a tax.\n\n\"I'll do what I have to do to protect the state,\" Newsom told The New York Times in an interview earlier this month.\n\nIn a separate interview, Newsom said the news that billionaires like Brin and Page were leaving the state was exactly the response he had feared. California is home to more billionaires than any other state.\n\n\"This is my fear. It's just what I warned against,\" Newsom told Politico. \"It's happening.\"",

Last year a Los Angeles judge ruled that the platforms’ design features may be responsible for harm – and not just the third-party content posted on sites and apps.\n\nHistorically, tech firms have turned to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law underpinning US internet regulation that exempts platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users, as part of their legal defence. The first bellwether case is still due to begin on 27 January with jury selection.\n\nSnap remains a defendant in the other two cases.\n\nBeasley Allen, a law firm involved in the lawsuits on the plaintiff side, has said the cases could have profound consequences including billions of dollars in damages, forcing changes in platform design and new US regulations governing how tech firms interact with minors.\n\n“The litigation is being compared to past landmark cases against big tobacco and opioid manufacturers – industries that were held accountable for public health harms after years of denial,” the firm said in a statement last year.\n\nSnap, Meta, TikTok and YouTube have been contacted for comment.",

    "title": "How to Kill a Fish",
    "description": "The Japanese chef Junya Yamasaki mastered a butchery technique that results in tastier seafood—and he’s taught some Southern California fishermen how to do it, too.",
    "fullText": "The method is considered significantly more humane than the standard alternatives for killing a fish (thwacking it on the head, letting it suffocate), and is analogous to halal and kosher butchery, which both require that animals be slaughtered with a swift, decisive cut to the throat. It also results in fish that tastes better and stays fresh significantly longer. “The process brings out the best characteristic of every species,” Yamasaki told me—a firm silkiness for white fish, a clean acidity for tuna. It works in part by stemming the flood of stress hormones and other chemicals that a fish’s body begins to release upon capture, staving off rigor mortis and the stink of decay. Conner Mitchell, a restaurateur and a commercial fisherman, and the captain of the Jamaica Day—the small pilothouse boat we were fishing on—was impressed the first time he saw Yamasaki do it. “I’m looking at a fish that would have been stiff, now as flexible as tissue paper,” Mitchell said.\n\nIn Japan, you can assume that the fish at any good restaurant met its end by way of ike and shinkei jime; in the U.S., the same is true at restaurants offering catch imported from Tokyo’s famed Toyosu Market. Among the fishermen of Southern California, the practice can largely be traced to Yamasaki, whose evangelism has quietly transformed the local seafood supply. On the deck of the Jamaica Day, Mitchell and an array of other energetic restaurant-industry dudes in their thirties—all of whom learned the technique under Yamasaki’s tutelage—set up rods, checked the boat’s radar, and gleefully spotted clusters of birds diving in the distance, which signalled that schools of bonito swam beneath them. Whenever a line began to jerk, the group exploded in a joyful chorus. Then the men took turns reeling the fish in, and putting them out of their misery.\n\nTwice, I reeled in a bonito myself—a process that I found surprisingly intimate, just me and an invisible squirming weight at the other end of the line. Both times, I struggled as I turned the crank, heart pounding, almost certain that I wouldn’t succeed, until I caught sight of a silver flash at the water’s surface. Then Danny Miller or Cole Moser—a chef and a bartender, respectively—would pull it on board. As Miller gutted one particularly beautiful specimen, tossing its organs into the spray before slipping it into a slurry of ice and salt water, he pointed out that, because of the ike and shinkei jime, the fish had retained its vibrant color. If it had died slowly, it would have already gone dull and gray.",

    "title": "Uber, often sued over car crashes, pushes for law to limit lawyer fees",
    "description": "The ride share giant is advocating for changes to California law that would limit how much lawyers can collect in fees. Attorneys say it will obliterate their personal injury practices and leave victims unable to sue.",
    "fullText": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nThe long-simmering fight between some of L.A.’s best-known billboard attorneys and Uber, one of their most frequent targets, is poised to spill out of the courtroom and onto the November ballot.\n\nThe ride-share giant is gathering signatures for an initiative that, if passed by voters, would cap how much attorneys can earn in vehicle collision cases. The company pledges the change will give victims a larger cut of their settlement money, alleging predatory attorneys are inflating medical bills to increase their own profits.\n\nLawyers claim it will decimate their lucrative niche — car crash lawsuits in the automobile haven that is California — and ultimately leave thousands of people with small or challenging cases unable to sue because they can’t find an attorney.\n\nThis fight, lawyers say, is existential.\n\nAttorneys from Sweet James and Jacoby & Meyers — the names and faces of which will be imprinted in the minds of most California drivers — have given almost $1 million to a committee opposing the ballot measure, according to campaign filings. Dozens of other deep-pocketed attorneys have joined, raising an impressive war chest already surpassing $46 million.\n\n“Uber knows darn well what they’ve done,” said Nicholas Rowley, among those leading the opposition. “This law is designed to wipe out ordinary working people’s ability to get representation.”\n\nAttorneys have condemned the fee cap as a Trojan horse meant to trick voters into wrecking the delicate math behind personal injury lawsuits. Currently, personal injury attorneys typically take 33% to 40% of a client’s payout. That is enough, they say, for them to earn a living and risk taking cases on a contingency fee basis — meaning, if they lose, they don’t get paid.\n\nUber’s proposal would cap attorney fees for car crash cases at 25% and require extra costs — filing fees, depositions, experts — to be calculated before the fee split rather than coming out of the client’s portion.\n\nThe two sides have conflicting views of who would be expected to pay for medical fees, which often drain a significant portion of an injured client’s payout. Attorneys said in order to guarantee clients get 75% of the money, lawyers will have to foot the bill for these medical costs, opening the possibility they would walk away with nothing. Uber said the question of who covers medical costs is “not contemplated by the measure” and it expects clients would pay.\n\nThe measure would tightly limit what medical expenses can be claimed and curb most damages to rates based on insurance. A doctor-led political action committee opposing the measure has raised more than $4 million, according to campaign finance records, arguing it will prevent Californians from getting treatment.\n\nUber said in a statement that nothing in the measure prevents car accident victims from securing doctors and lawyers. Instead, the company said, the measure is aimed at tackling a perennial problem in California’s legal system: attorneys pushing car crash victims into expensive surgeries in order to fatten their fees. The only Californians affected, Uber claims, will be “shady billboard lawyers whose business model relies on abusing auto accident victims for their own personal gain.”\n\n“Californians deserve a system that prioritizes victims over billboard lawyers,” said Adam Blinick, Uber’s head of public policy. “Capping attorney fees, banning kickbacks, and ending inflated medical billing are common-sense reforms that will protect auto accident victims and lower costs, and we’re confident voters will agree.”\n\nUber has poured fuel on the fire with federal racketeering lawsuits targeting both Downtown LA Law Group, or DTLA, and Jacob Emrani, two prominent personal injury law offices in Southern California. The lawsuits allege the attorneys had “side agreements” with certain doctors to inflate medical bills for unnecessary procedures to get a larger payout.\n\nIn an Instagram post, DTLA called the lawsuit a “calculated attempt by a billion-dollar corporation” to suppress legitimate claims. An attorney representing Emrani called it meritless and part of a campaign “to shut the courthouse doors to victims injured by Uber drivers.”\n\nGearing up for a fight, Consumer Attorneys of California, a powerful trial lawyer trade group, is pushing three ballot measures of its own, including one seeking to increase legal liability for ride-share companies if a passenger is sexually assaulted by a driver and the other aiming to nullify the fee-capping measure if it passes. Billboards have sprung up across Los Angeles reminding Californians that Uber is the subject of a string of recent New York Times investigations into sexual assault by drivers.\n\nThe company said it has invested billions in keeping riders safe and has “done more than any other company to confront” sexual violence.\n\nConsumer Watchdog, a consumer advocacy group that sponsored some of the billboards and receives funding from trial attorneys, put out a “consumer alert” branding the fee cap as a “license to kill” measure, claiming it would ultimately pave the way for Uber to move forward with robotaxis without worrying about getting sued. Uber said this was “flat-out untrue” and the measure has nothing to do with autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe push by Uber comes at a tense point for California’s legal bar. The Times reported this fall on private investors looking to bankroll California sex abuse cases, and separate allegations of fraudulent lawsuits and unethical conduct by Downtown LA Law Group, a firm known for car crash lawsuits that played a prominent role in L.A. County’s $4-billion sex abuse settlement.\n\nDTLA has denied all wrongdoing and said it operates “with unwavering integrity, prioritizing client welfare.”\n\nSome attorneys worry about how voters will perceive their industry when it’s time to cast ballots.\n\n“I’ll tell you straight up, we could do a better job policing ourselves,” said Rowley, who said he believed the State Bar had historically been weak on California lawyers. “It creates a situation where Uber can do what it’s doing.”\n\nCalls for reform within California’s legal community have gained momentum in recent months.\n\nJoseph Nicchitta, the county’s interim chief executive officer, called on the State Bar to implement “badly needed ethical reforms” that would make big personal injury cases less profitable for lawyers. Attorney and business advocacy groups have made public pleas to keep private equity out of the state’s legal landscape, worrying it fuels frivolous lawsuits. Gov. Gavin Newsom has similarly expressed unease.\n\n“Our legal system is meant to provide justice, transparency, and accountability — not a business model that uses survivors of abuse or trauma as a revenue stream,” said a spokesperson for the governor. “California can — and must — hold two truths at the same time: standing unequivocally with survivors and victims, while also demanding integrity within the law firms and other businesses that work within our legal system.”\n\nCalifornians unhappy with problem law firms already have a way to ding them without the ballot measure, Uber’s opponents argue. A new law went into effect Jan. 1 giving private citizens the right to sue an attorney for unethical practices. Many such practices are already illegal but seldom prosecuted. That includes advertising containing false promises and using third parties to solicit clients.\n\nThe Times reported this fall that nine plaintiffs represented by Downtown LA Law Group were paid by recruiters to sue the county for sex abuse in juvenile halls, four of whom said they were told to make up claims. The firm has denied paying anyone to file lawsuits.\n\n“This is exactly why we wrote the bill,” said Sen. Tom Umberg (D-Santa Ana), a lawyer who oversees the Senate Judiciary Committee, in response to The Times’ Dec. 31 story on the firm. “I expect that someone will take it upon themselves to actually enforce that law.”",

    "fullText": "If you’ve been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here’s what’s actually driving the nervousness: it’s not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.\n\nTake Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.\n\nDavid Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told The San Francisco Standard this week. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.\n\nBut that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.\n\nNow, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nBut the resistance is fierce and bipartisan. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They’ve called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and Peter Thiel’s firm leasing Miami office space last month. (Thiel has had ties to Miami for years — including a home — but an uncharacteristic press release about the move was seemingly meant to send a message.)\n\nEven Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting it. “This will be defeated, there’s no question in my mind,” he told the New York Times this week, adding that he’d been “relentlessly working behind the scenes” against the proposal. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nFor now, the union isn’t backing down. “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives,” said executive committee member Debru Carthan to the Journal last weekend. “The few who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.”\n\nThe proposal needs 875,000 signatures to make November’s ballot, where it would need a simple majority to pass.",

    "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom is headed to Davos to challenge President Donald Trump's economic agenda.",
    "fullText": "A tiny Swiss ski town with a population of just over 10,000 will play host this week to a clash between two American politicians, President Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and their radically different visions of the future of capitalism.\n\nNewsom announced on Friday that he will travel more than 6,000 miles to make his return to Davos, Switzerland, to speak this week at the World Economic Forum.\n\nOpponents criticized Newsom for being an out-of-touch \"Davos Democrat\" for attending the elite gathering of business and world leaders at least five times while he was mayor of San Francisco between 2004 and 2011.\n\nNewsom's return to the annual gathering of business and political elites is all about displaying a forceful rebuke to President Donald Trump on the world stage as Newsom potentially prepares a run for president, political experts told Business Insider.\n\n\"Newsom's arrival at Davos confirms his desire to be seen as the Democratic Party leader and go-to guy for world leaders wanting an alternative to President Trump,\" Sally Susman, a longtime democratic fundraiser, said.\n\nIn speeches and meetings, Newsom plans to argue that Trump's economic agenda has been a failure that other leaders should not be part of, Izzy Gardon, a Newsom spokesperson, said.\n\n\"The Governor will be bringing an extra suitcase of kneepads for anyone lining up to bend the knee to Donald Trump,\" Gardon said.\n\nNewsom himself did not shy away from the main reason he is returning: to counterpunch Trump. The president will speak on Wednesday, a day before Newsom.\n\n\"Trump's economic agenda betrays our nation: it is not 'America First' but 'Trump First' — rewarding the favored, punishing the dissenters, and burdening the rest,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"At the World Economic Forum, I will forcefully confront these abuses and resolutely defend the principles to which California owes its economic strength: disciplined governance, world-leading universities, boundless innovation, and an open embrace of global cultures.\"\n\nNewsom, who has yet to officially announce his candidacy, looks more presidential rubbing shoulders at a gathering of world leaders than he would staying in Sacramento, according to Ambassador Derek Shearer, the Chevalier Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College.\n\n\"By coming to Davos, he can combine his role as the leading Democratic critic of Trump and as a serious contender to replace him as president,\" Shearer said. \"Of course, it's a high-stakes game, but so far, he is playing it well.\"\n\nNewsom will be rubbing shoulders with some of the richest people in the world at a time when some billionaires are fleeing California ahead of a ballot proposal that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents with a net worth of more than $1 billion.\n\nNewsom has said he opposes the measure. It is yet to be seen if he will address the matter at Davos.",

    "fullText": "We here at Business Insider thought it was time to talk about the future of capitalism.\n\nSeems we weren't the only ones.\n\nWhen California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced late last week that he would show up at Davos essentially to rebut whatever President Donald Trump plans to say, he specifically zoned in on, what else? Capitalism.\n\nAt Davos, the Democratic governor plans to \"draw a clear line between democratic capitalism and crony capitalism,\" according to his office. Newsom will \"contrast California's rules-based, competitive economic model with Trump's politics of intimidation, favoritism, and self-dealing.\"\n\nIn short, Newsom wants to articulate his own version of capitalism on the global stage.\n\nThat, coupled with Trump's Wednesday speech, which is expected to touch on affordability, shows just how hot the topic is.\n\nYou might recall that last month we put out a survey seeking your thoughts on the future of capitalism. And in the new year, we started a series on the subject. The first piece detailed the federal government's investments in private-sector companies under this White House. Newsom's office called those investments \"an unprecedented assault on free markets\" and took issue with other Trump moves.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Newsom's statements. A White House official earlier told Business Insider they viewed these equity stakes \"as a very powerful tool that we're using very judiciously in very specific sectors for very specific reasons,\" for purposes of US economic and national security.\n\nWe will stay all over this subject at Davos this week. () Meanwhile, our capitalism series has chronicled how America's high schools are teaching capitalism. See for yourself how you'd score on this 12th-grade capitalism quiz!\n\nThe next piece, slated for Monday, is on the capitalist spirit thriving in companies. Stay with us!",

    "fullText": "A couple has been arrested after they were caught having sex in the parking lot of a Maryland Applebee's.\n\nMaryland State Police confirmed that Trooper Anthony Jones responded to a report of indecent exposure at the Applebee’s located at 45480 Miramar Way in California, Maryland, on Monday, January 12, according to a press release shared by the department.\n\nUpon Jones’ arrival, the police officer found Kaneesha Latasha Gross of Lexington Park and James Matthew Washington of Capitol Heights and caught them mid-coitus.\n\nBoth Gross, 35, and Washington, 58, were then arrested at the scene and taken to the St. Mary’s County Detention Center. They were both charged with indecent exposure and disorderly conduct, according to the release.\n\nGross and Washington have both likely been released on bond, as there are no records of the two on the St. Mary’s County Detention Center’s inmate search.\n\nCalifornia Man Charged with Kidnapping Maryland Woman from Crash Site and Raping Her\n\nThe Maryland State Police Department did not respond to Us Weekly’s request regarding an update on the case.\n\nIt is not currently clear if Gross or Washington have entered pleas or if they have retained legal representation. Meanwhile, it’s also not known how or if the two knew each other prior to the incident.\n\nAccording to the Maronick Law LLC website, disorderly contact is the leading reason for police calls in Ocean City, Maryland. The charge can be vague, with some Maryland law enforcement using it as a “catch-all” for any and all public disturbances.\n\nGenerally, disorderly conduct charges stem from “any behavior that disturbs the peace, endangers public safety or disrupts public order.” Common examples of disorderly conduct include public intoxication, public fighting, bar fights and engaging in excessively loud or disruptive behavior. In the case of Gross and Washington, disorderly conduct can also include sexual acts performed in public.\n\nBreaking Down ‘RHOP’ Star Wendy Osefo and Husband Eddie Osefo’s Arrest for Fraud: What We Know\n\nFor those who are found guilty of disorderly conduct in Maryland, common penalties include being sentenced to up to 60 days in jail and being ordered to pay a fine of up to $500. In fact, some people found guilty of the crime have been sentenced to both serve time and pay a fine.\n\nGross and Washington may face even more penalties if they are found guilty of the indecent exposure charge. For those charged with misdemeanor indecent exposure in Maryland, they can face up to 3 years in prison, be ordered to pay a fine of up to $1,000 or be given both penalties.\n\nIn order to be found guilty of the charge in Maryland, prosecutors must prove that “the act was intentional and involved the exposure of genitals in public or in the presence of someone other than a spouse,” according to Maronick Law LLC website. The law firm added that those who are charged with indecent exposure often argue about the intent behind the act or claim mistaken identity.\n\nMaryland law defines indecent exposure as when someone intentionally exposes their genitals in a public place or to someone that would not typically see their genitals. Examples of indecent exposure in Maryland include public urination or defecation, flashing, streaking, masturbation in public, sexual acts in public or mooning.",

    "description": "It might be surprising, but the data reflects a snapshot in time and could still shift in coming months.",
    "fullText": "For the first time in over two decades, California has reached a milestone. The entire state is officially free of drought conditions, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that, according to newly released federal data from the U.S. Drought Monitor, not a single square mile of California is currently classified as being in drought or even \"abnormally dry.\"\n\nThe last time the state achieved that status was December 2000 (although it came close in 2011). This achievement marks a hopeful moment after years of water scarcity, wildfire risks, and conservation mandates.\n\nPersistent rain and snow pushed California into its third year of above-average precipitation. Heavy storms around New Year's Day helped erase the last remaining dry pocket in Northern California's Modoc County, tipping the state to 100% drought-free status.\n\nThis is great news for communities across the state. Improved water availability eases pressure on farmers, reduces wildfire risk, and relieves households that have faced years of restrictions and rising utility costs. Healthier soil moisture and replenished reservoirs also strengthen ecosystems that have struggled under prolonged dry conditions.\n\nCalifornia's recent swings between extreme drought and intense rainfall are part of a broader pattern known as hydroclimate whiplash. That happens when the climate rapidly swings from wet to dry and back, challenging water management systems and communities alike.\n\nCalifornia will, of course, need to continue focusing on smart water management. But the moment offers residents something they haven't had in years: a little hiatus from worries over water.\n\nCalifornia State Climatologist Michael Anderson called it a \"great start\" to the wet season, as relayed by the Washington Post. Anderson noted that the data reflects a snapshot in time and could still shift in the coming months.\n\nBrian Fuchs of the National Drought Mitigation Center emphasized that water access still varies by region. Some mountain areas like the Sierra Nevada are experiencing \"snow drought.\" That happens when precipitation has fallen as rain rather than snow, reducing long-term water storage (due to reduced snowpack).\n\n\"Even though that map looks like everything's perfect, well, depending on where you're at in the state and depending on the sector you're in or how your water is delivered, there could still be some lingering problems,\" Fuchs said, as reported by the Washington Post.\n\nShould every state provide free energy-efficient home upgrades?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Marissa Chiechi took a leap of faith, moving from California to Virginia, to be with her boyfriend. She said it was the best decision she ever made.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Marissa Chiechi, 32, who relocated from Los Angeles to Alexandria, Virginia, in 2023. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I met my now-husband, Rejoy, on Bumble. I was born and raised in California. He's originally from Texas, but at the time, he was in Redondo Beach on a contract assignment with NASA.\n\nOur first date was actually a double date. We had a socially distanced picnic in the park — very COVID. After that, we ended up texting constantly. With everything going on, we got close quickly, and before long, we were seeing each other all the time.\n\nIt didn't take long for things to get serious. We met in May 2020, and by September — around his birthday — we took a trip to Joshua Tree. That was when he told me: he didn't know exactly when the move would happen, but his job would likely take him to the East Coast. He wanted to be upfront and not spring it on me later.\n\nI really appreciated his honesty. And, honestly, the idea of moving excited me. I've never been the biggest fan of California. I've always wanted four seasons, which you just don't get there. I'm not a beach person, either.\n\nSo when the possibility of leaving for the East Coast came up, it didn't feel like a hard decision. In my heart, I've always felt like an East Coast girl. I love fast-paced environments and big cities. Rejoy and I are also both big travelers, and it felt like it could be the start of an adventure.\n\nAbout six to eight months after that conversation, he told me he needed to be on the East Coast at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.\n\nI immediately assumed that moving to the East Coast meant we'd be living in New York, and I was like, \"Of course I'll go.\" I've been to New York more than 20 times, and I love it there. I'm also probably one of the few people who genuinely enjoys taking the subway.\n\nBut his job wasn't sending him to New York City. It was sending him to Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nI knew absolutely nothing about Alexandria, and at first, I assumed it was just going to be kind of in the middle of nowhere in Virginia. When I learned we'd be only about 15 minutes from Washington, D.C., I felt hopeful I'd still get the city energy I really wanted.\n\nEven so, I got a lot of \"You're leaving California?! Everyone wants to live in California!\" from friends and family. People also tried to scare me about the weather, too. They kept asking things like, \"Are you ready to be snowed in?\" and \"What about freezing temperatures?\"\n\nHowever, once I got there, it wasn't nearly as extreme as my circle made it out to be. I even bought a brand-new North Face coat that's been sitting in my closet ever since. I've barely worn it.\n\nThe hardest part of the move was shipping my car; it cost about $2,000. Luckily, I did get to put a few tubs of clothes in the car. Rejoy's brother is also a flight attendant, so he gets to fly for free, which means free checked bags. So I packed a lot of luggage and sent it with him.\n\nThe move has turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nWe got to Alexandria in 2021. It's a little Hallmark city. It's so cute, quaint, historic, and genuinely charming. It has more of a small-town feel, but with a diverse mix of people. It seems like a lot of people are drawn to it because they really enjoy a slower pace of life.\n\nAnd getting from Alexandria into DC is easy. There's a beautiful bridge, and the drive is only about 10 minutes. The scenery is incredible, and you even pass through Maryland.\n\nThe apartment we rented in Alexandria was selected sight unseen, though we did one virtual tour before signing the lease. It was a one-bedroom, 720-square-foot unit that cost $2,453 a month.\n\nSurprisingly, our rent was more expensive than what I had been paying in California. On top of that, we each paid between $350 and $400 a month to keep our cars in the parking garage.\n\nVirginia gets all four seasons, which was one of my favorite parts of living there. We had a really nice view from our apartment balcony, and I could literally see all the fall foliage and watch the leaves change color throughout the year. It was so beautiful.\n\nWhen I first moved to Alexandria, I definitely had moments when I felt down and really missed my friends and family. I didn't really know anyone there, and while I had a few friends who were in the DC area who would come visit, it could still feel lonely.\n\nRejoy could fly for free, so he visited his family in Texas whenever he wanted. I didn't have that option; I had to pay for my trips. So I didn't go home as much, but whenever I was feeling especially homesick, I'd find a way to make a visit happen.\n\nFor a while, it really did feel like it was just the two of us. That forced me to get comfortable with being alone and to genuinely be happy with myself—it helped me learn a lot more about who I am.\n\nEventually, a few people from my high school moved to Alexandria, and we became friends with their friends. Our circle slowly grew, but it took a long time.\n\nLooking back, it was empowering. I hadn't really moved anywhere before, but I've always been a traveler and someone who wants to explore. I remember thinking, \"Even if this doesn't work out, at least I'm in a new place.\"\n\nIn 2023, we got engaged. We were in Cappadocia to watch the hot air balloons, and I had no idea it was coming. The entire trip was a funny experience.\n\nHe had told me, very sneakily, to pack a nice dress, but our luggage got lost. To make it even more ironic, the weather was bad, and the hot air balloons didn't even take off that day.\n\nIn our engagement photos, the balloons are actually photoshopped in by the photographer. While it almost didn't feel \"right\" in the moment, it was still really special.\n\nIn 2024, Rejoy's contract ended, so we naturally had to ask ourselves: What do we do next? We didn't really want to stay in Alexandria because the type of home we wanted wasn't affordable. So it made sense for us to leave Virginia and reevaluate.\n\nWe moved in April 2025. For now, I'm back in Los Angeles, and he's in Texas. He just accepted another job in Austin, so I'll be moving there next. I'm really excited.\n\nIf there's one thing this whole experience has taught me, it's to stay open to opportunities and whatever comes next. Time goes by so fast, and I want to spend it traveling, being present, and fully experiencing what life has to offer.",

    "description": "Larry Page, Google cofounder, moves major assets and residence from California to Florida as the Billionaire Tax Act targets ultrawealthy residents.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page recently drew his line in the sand on a beach on the opposite side of California — and it cost him over $170 million.\n\nCalifornia has proposed the Billionaire Tax Act, which would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth over $1 billion. Page, whose net worth is $269 billion as of January according to Forbes, isn't giving California the option to tax him and is deserting the Golden State for a state on the opposite extreme of taxing the wealthy: Florida.\n\nThe proposed bill, which doesn't appear on the ballot until November, would retroactively tax billionaires living in California as of January 1. Conveniently, Page reportedly located a Florida residence just before then.\n\nPage purchased a 4.5-acre compound in Miami's glamorous Coconut Grove neighborhood in December 2025 for $101.5 million, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Miami-Dade County property records show late restaurateur Jonathan Lewis previously owned the property.\n\nAnd for good measure, property records show a trust linked to Page bought another property — less than a mile away from the other — for $71.9 million in January this year. The trust, Tropical Frontier Revocable Trust, lists Florida attorney Benjamin Babcock and Mary McFadden Quisenberry, the chief operating officer of Palo Alto, California-based Rosewood Family Advisors, as trustees. Babcock declined to comment on the transaction.\n\nTax filings from Page's family foundation, the Carl Victor Page Memorial Foundation, show Rosewood Family Advisors provided tax and accounting services for the foundation in 2024. Rosewood Family Advisors could not be reached for comment.\n\nPage also filed to move a number of his businesses from California to Delaware, Florida, and Texas, Business Insider reported earlier this year.\n\nAn agent involved in the $101.5-million transaction, Danny Hertzberg of The Jills Zeder Group, declined to comment on this particular deal. He said wealthy Californians have been lining up to buy homes in Florida recently.\n\n\"We started feeling an impact, let's say in early December, which really picked up going to the end of the year,\" Hertzberg told Business Insider. \"California's dominating the high end of the market. The market right now, in terms of offers and active buyers, has a huge California presence, and it's directly related to 5% net worth.\"\n\nWealthy people moving to South Florida isn't a new trend, though some of the most recent residents made large splashes. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, arguably, became the most notable Florida mover after building his own compound on an exclusive island in Miami's Biscayne Bay.\n\nSouth Florida tried a somewhat rebrand in the early 2020s as the Silicon Valley of the East and did attract some movers. This latest shift has serious legs and the potential to change the perception of South Florida, according to Hertzberg.\n\n\"All of the movement I've seen from California is primary residences — people putting roots down and planning to be here,\" Hertzberg said. \"I think that may push along an already strong existing trend as Miami emerges as a major destination for finance and tech.\"\n\n\"With the level and caliber of people that are looking, that have already acquired properties here, and that are moving here, I do think, on the overall business perspective of Miami, it's already one of the major players in the country, if not the world,\" Hertzberg added. \"And it's going to be elevated as one of the premier destinations for those industries of finance, tech, and everything related.\"",

To remain silent in the face of such wrongdoing is not neutrality — it is complicity,\" he said.\n\nNewsom, who's been a vocal critic of Trump, plans to call out the president during public speaking events and private meetings with business and world leaders.\n\nThe governor's office said he plans to challenge CEOs and institutions that it says have been complicit in Trump's efforts to erode democracy. He also plans to make the case for \"democratic capitalism\" as opposed to \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to speak at Davos on January 21. Newsom is scheduled to speak on January 22.",

(AP) — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against California that sought detailed voting records and personal data on its 23 million registered voters, concluding that the government's request was “unprecedented and illegal.”\n\nThe Trump administration's lawsuit, filed last year, contended that California and other states were illegally blocking the federal government's wide-ranging effort to scrutinize detailed voter data that states said was private and protected.\n\nThe administration “may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections” U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana said in his 33-page decision.\n\nFurthermore, the attempt to gather and centralize the personal information would have a chilling effect on voter registration and threaten “the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy,” the judge ruled.\n\n“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the executive (branch) without action from Congress,” Carter said. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections.”\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIt has accused states of failing to respond sufficiently to questions about the procedures they take to maintain voter rolls. The department has sued 23 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, and the District of Columbia for detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.\n\nState election officials have questioned what the DOJ plans to do with that information. Last fall 10 Democratic secretaries of state wrote Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to express concern over reports that the DOJ was sharing state voter data with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, operates a program that checks citizenship status.\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Shirley Weber, the state's chief elections officer, said in a statement that California would “continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”",

    "description": "California Attorney General Rob Bonta's investigation comes amid a growing backlash to xAI and its Grok chatbot.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk's xAI is now facing pressure from US regulators over Grok's generation of nonconsensual sexualized images of real people.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that his office was investigating the numerous reports of such images.\n\n\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said in a statement. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"\n\nThe news comes after officials in India, the UK, Indonesia, and Malaysia have taken their own varying actions against Grok. Indonesia and Malaysia went so far as to block access to Grok.\n\nOfcom, the UK's communications regulator, announced its investigation earlier this week. Prime Minister Keir Starmer previously told lawmakers that X could \"lose the right to self-regulate.\"\n\nIn response to Business Insider's request for comment about Bonta's probe, xAI replied, \"Legacy Media Lies.\" Musk's AI company frequently responds to media requests with that line.\n\nAmid the backlash, xAI limited access to Grok's image generation to paying subscribers.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Musk said he was unaware of \"any naked underage images generated by Grok.\" Musk had previously said anyone asking Grok to make illegal content \"will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\"\n\n\"Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images, it does so only according to user requests,\" Musk wrote on X. \"When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state.\"\n\nMusk's statement belies many of the instances that regulators were looking into. Namely, the investigations were sparked by concerns about users asking Grok to sexualize images, such as depicting a person in a bikini when the original photo did not show them in such a state of dress.\n\nThe US Senate unanimously passed a bill via voice vote on Tuesday that would give victims a federal civil right to sue users who ask AI to create such images. The text of legislation, called \"The Defiance Act,\" mentions the digital manipulation of a photo to \"remove the clothing of the individual so that the person appears to be nude.\"\n\nSen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, who wrote the bill, said it was aimed at stopping instances like the Grok images.\n\n\"Recent reports showed that X, formerly Twitter, can ask its AI chatbot Grok to undress women and underage girls in photos,\" Durbin said on the Senate floor. \"Grok will comply to show various states of undress with images I won't repeat for the record, but they're horrible.\"\n\nIt is unclear if the bill will receive a vote in the House.\n\nLast year, President Donald Trump signed bipartisan legislation into law that requires social media platforms to remove non-consensual photos, as well as AI deepfakes, within 48 hours of receiving a request to do so.",

Some of the images show real women, some are fake, some are nonconsensual, and some depict children, all in “minimal clothing”, as the AI tool itself described them.\n\nX and its parent company, xAI, have taken some measures to curb the flood. The social network shut off its image generation feature for users who do not pay, which constitute the majority of X’s users.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Musk has obstinately recast the AI tool’s problems as everything but what they really are. He’s been promoting its popularity as if it were a piece of productivity software. He crows about its download numbers with dubious claims. On 10 January; he celebrated Grok reaching the top spot in New Zealand’s version of Apple’s App Store. (Rankings by the analytics firm SimilarWeb of the most-downloaded apps in New Zealand, which were updated the same day as Musk’s tweet, put Grok in 14th place.) The same day, he reposted a tweet about Grok reaching the No 1 spot in Thailand’s Apple App Store. (SimilarWeb’s rankings do not show Grok in the top 50 most-downloaded apps in the country.) On 9 January, he retweeted a post about Google searches for Grok spiking. (I would guess the increase in searches is evidence of great interest in the AI tool’s scandal more so than interest in using it.)\n\nIn response to the UK’s threats to ban the AI tool, he accused the country’s government of stifling free speech. After watchdogs cited instances of Grok undressing minors, he said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” handing the responsibility to moderate his social network to law enforcement and courts. “Illegal” is in a court’s hands and frees him from moderating all but the most heinous content.\n\nPerhaps to Musk, all press is good press? He may be right: his AI tool seems likely to accrue more users and few penalties as a result of the flood of nearly naked images.\n\nGrok has faced some repercussions: the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched an investigation into xAI and Grok, and possible punishments could include a total ban. The Internet Watch Foundation, also based in the UK, announced it had found instances of child sexual abuse material generated by Grok in Dark Web forums. X’s revenue in the UK has plummeted by 60% as concerns over content moderation and brand safety grow. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have limited access to the AI tool in response.\n\nBut missing from the chorus decrying Grok are the two de facto smartphone regulators of smartphone software, Apple and Google, operators of the world’s biggest mobile app stores. Neither has indicated whether the Grok’s output violates their app stores’ terms of service. In the US, there’s been little backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nThe lesson for Musk and other tech leaders seems apparent: the fewer restrictions you place on AI, the more shocking content you allow it to generate, the greater your engagement and your profit.\n\nTech’s billionaires are plotting against a proposed tax on their fortunes that may appear on ballots across California in November.\n\nVenture capitalist and antichrist evangelist Peter Thiel has already made a $3m donation to fight the proposal, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the state. Other billionaires have started an encrypted group chat on Signal to strategize against it, which includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar” David Sacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s called “Save California”. My colleague Dara Kerr reports on the division among billionaires:\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nUnder the proposed tax, Huang would pay roughly $7bn, and Page and Brin would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, held annually in Las Vegas for decades since its start in 1967, made global news this year. Nvidia and AMD chose it as the forum for major announcements on new hardware and software. Samsung announced a double folding phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Lego debuted a “smart brick” that seems quite fun as well. Robots abounded, rechristened as “physical AI”.\n\nIt’s been quite the turnaround for CES. For much of the 2010s, hardware announcements rarely made for top headlines. New DVD players or TVs did not make a splash. Smartphones dominated, and they all looked extremely similar. Apple, the most valuable company in the world at the end of the decade, even skipped it entirely. Now, however, Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world, and it chose CES to present what’s next. Artificial intelligence and robotics have breathed new life into CES. The themes and innovations that define the convention are broader and affect more industries outside tech than they once did.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I predicted that consumer technology would take many strange new shapes in the coming year, which seems to already be true as we view new developments in robotics. Humanoid robots debuted at CES, including one from Hyundai and Boston Dynamics. My colleague Samuel Gibbs dubbed a laundry-folding robot one of the best things about the convention.\n\nMeta blocked nearly 550,000 accounts in first days of Australia’s under-16s social media ban\n\nIran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some time\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with Apple\n\n‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at risk",

    "description": "After more than a decade living in Spain, visiting the US now brings reverse culture shock, from car dependency and traffic to high costs and busy lives.",
    "fullText": "I've lived in Spain for over a decade. I'm always excited to go \"home\" to visit family and friends in the San Francisco Bay Area, and spend time in a place that is so familiar.\n\nI usually visit once a year. My first week back, I'm reminiscing, and my brain is buzzing thinking about how I can move back and what my life would look like. Yet, by the third or fourth week — if I stay that long — reality settles in. The high cost of living, traffic, aggressive drivers, friends having packed schedules, needing a car to get around, unless you live in the heart of a city.\n\nI'm reminded that I'm happy where I live, navigating different cultural customs and speaking Spanish every day.\n\nThe truth is, several aspects of American life become harder for me to adapt to the longer I'm away. I experience reverse cultural shock when I visit.\n\nA car is necessary for going grocery shopping, to the gym or a dance class, meeting up with friends, or essentially getting from point A to B, unless you live in the city and can walk or rely on public transportation. There's no denying that life in the United States revolves around the car. Public transit in the suburbs isn't efficient, often doesn't take you where you need to go, or is nonexistent.\n\nI love that where I live, I can walk out my door and go to the grocery store, coffee shop, bar, or restaurant, or take public transit.\n\nAs more people have moved to the Bay Area, housing prices have soared, along with an increase in cars on the road. Commute traffic is so bad that distances that normally take an hour can take two or three hours. The freeway can feel more like a parking lot with stop-and-go traffic.\n\nWhen I visit, I'm advised to adhere to specific times of leaving the house or returning, to avoid sitting in excessive amounts of traffic. In other words, plans and scheduling are influenced by commute traffic, which typically starts around 2 or 3 p.m. and lasts until 7 p.m.\n\nI love trying new restaurants and visiting coffee shops, but with costs continually rising, I'm less inclined to go out for coffee or eat a meal. How did a basic drip coffee become $5 or more, plus tax and an expected tip.\n\nEating out, even if it's a hamburger and fries, always costs a minimum of $30, plus tax and tip. And more often than not, I'm disappointed by the experience. Now, I prefer to stay in and make a meal.\n\nFriends are busy with their work and families. When I lived in the US, I was often frustrated that some friends wouldn't have time to meet up for coffee or a meal out — their calendar was filled for the next two or three months.\n\nFriends block out time in their calendars to see me often, but they remind me that if I lived nearby, we wouldn't see each other more frequently.\n\nI'm not a big shopper. I never liked spending my time in malls or shopping centers — finding parking, navigating crowds, browsing and trying on clothing, and hoping for a successful purchase. I want new outfits in my closet, but I'd rather forgo the shopping experience.\n\nHowever, when I'm in the US, I'm eager to go to Costco and stock up on basics, such as socks, sports bras, pajamas, a pair of Levi's jeans when they have them, and whatever else that catches my attention. I also love going to T.J. Maxx and Marshall's for the treasure hunt of what bargains I will find, and I certainly don't need it, but I want it.\n\nOn my last visit, I told my mom, \"These stores are designed so you buy stuff you don't really need, but you feel like you're getting a good deal.\"\n\nPeople drive fast, aggressively, and most seem to be annoyed and angered that other drivers are on the road. Over 10 years ago, drivers would speed up rather than let me merge when I turned on my blinker. I stopped getting annoyed and changed my perspective — I assumed drivers would accelerate. On the rare occasions when they let me in, I was slow to respond because I didn't expect it.\n\nSo it's no surprise that I don't miss driving. I'm stressed and on edge when I drive in the Bay Area.",

    "description": "Rick Havacko decided to move to a new state after working remotely during the pandemic in California. He narrowed his choices to Austin or Nashville.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rick Havacko, a 58-year-old corporate communications lead in Austin. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWorking remotely during the pandemic was the springboard for my move from California to Texas. I was born and raised in Orange County. I realized that although I love Laguna Niguel, I didn't want to live the rest of my life there.\n\nIt's beautiful, but once you get outside the city, it's congested, and prices are high.\n\nI've worked for Toshiba Business for 13 years, and I've always been fully remote. After my employer approved my move, the choice was between Austin (where I had visited before and enjoyed) and Nashville, which I had heard great things about.\n\nAfter traveling to both places in the summer of 2021, I decided to make Austin my home.\n\nBoth areas featured all the benefits of city life with a rural feel. Nashville is an amazing city and very similar to Austin. It has great music, culture, and a very creative vibe with tons of energy.\n\nWhat drew me to Austin is that it has my gym, LA Fitness, so I felt like I could really hit the ground running.\n\nI've been here for about four and a half years, and it's been one of the best things I've ever done.\n\nGrowing up in Orange County, the furthest I ever went was to San Diego for college, which is so close I could come home anytime I wanted. Austin was my first permanent move, so I had a little trepidation.\n\nI remember driving all night past Camp Pendleton, finally arriving in Tucson, Arizona, to spend the night. I got there about 1 a.m., and I felt a lot of uncertainty, like, Am I really going to like this place?\n\nWhen I hit the Hill Country, just before Fredericksburg, and headed into Austin, I passed the beautiful sawgrass and oak trees, and a sense of calm enveloped me, giving me the feeling that I was in a good place.\n\nI moved to Dripping Springs, which is 20 miles west of downtown Austin. It's more affordable than Southern California and less congested, but ultimately, it came down to the energy of the city and its people.\n\nI look outside my window, and often see deer, foxes, wild turkey, and even a Longhorn steer walking by my fence. I would never experience that in Laguna Niguel. I love nature.\n\nI no longer have immediate family in California, but I miss my friends back home. Making new friends has been the biggest challenge I've faced, but I keep trying. I've joined a volleyball league and play soccer and softball, where I meet people.\n\nI miss the world-class beaches in California; here we're pretty landlocked. I'm also a huge Angels fan. I grew up following the team, and Toshiba has a suite at Angel Stadium, so I used to attend many games. I also enjoyed attending LA Galaxy games. For now, I've adopted the University of Texas Longhorns for football and baseball, and I go to those games.\n\nWhile Texans are not required to file a state income tax return (only a federal one), property taxes appear to be significantly higher here. Properties themselves, however, are relatively inexpensive here. My property here is about twice the size of my home in California, and it was less expensive.\n\nOverall, it's still cheaper to live here, although Austin is one of the priciest cities in Texas. Gas is more affordable in Austin, but other living costs are comparable. I kept my same salary when I moved.\n\nHere in Dripping Springs, you see people with big belt buckles and cowboy boots. It's cool and culturally different from Orange County.\n\nDowntown Austin is one of the most vibrant and exciting places on the planet. It bustles with positive energy, with live music at pretty much every turn, and the University of Texas at Austin adds to that vibe.\n\nI'm very happy here and plan to stay permanently.",

The plan at the time, according to sources, was to send 14 reporters and photographers to Tokyo to produce a separate daily color section, as it first did in 1984 when the games were held in Los Angeles. The Times will be covering next month’s Winter Games in Italy with one writer as Thuc Nhi Nguyen will be taking a break from the Lakers beat to cover the games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nWhen Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018, he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” Since the pandemic in 2020, however, the sports section has been reduced to the final four or five pages of the California section five days a week, with a standalone sports section of six to eight pages appearing only twice per week.\n\nDespite its statewide branding, the California Post's initial sports coverage will be centered squarely on Los Angeles, with a primary emphasis on the sports and teams the Los Angeles Times still covers in the Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA.\n\nHernandez and Harris will lead its MLB and Dodgers coverage, while Southern California News Group Lakers beat writer Khobi Price and longtime Lakers reporter Melissa Rohlin, who joined the Post last week, will anchor its NBA and Lakers coverage. Bonsignore will lead the NFL and Rams coverage while Bolch will lead college sports coverage, focusing on USC and UCLA.\n\nThe staffing losses at the Los Angeles Times come amid continued upheaval at the paper, which has faced newsroom cuts, buyouts and mounting uncertainty about its long-term investment in daily sports coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Post is not done hiring. Sources familiar with the startup’s plans say the outlet is continuing to pursue additional Times sports writers and other well-known local journalists before its launch on Jan. 26.",

    "fullText": "A married couple who work as landscapers were left shaken after thieves violently robbed the couple of their tools and seriously injured one of them.\n\nThe incident occurred on the afternoon of Jan. 7 as Esteban Vargas and his wife, Linda Huerta, were working at the South Pasadena home of one of their customers, according to a GoFundMe organized for the couple.\n\nVargas happened to be working in the customer’s backyard when two men approached the family’s pickup truck and began stealing tools out of it, prompting Huerta, who was nearby, to intervene.\n\nBrandon Ruiz, one of the couple’s customers, explained that she tried to stop the men from taking their tools.\n\n“She held onto the guy as the guy was getting back into his truck and he dragged her down the street,” he explained. “He hit her hard and she fell out of the truck and I guess that’s how she got the staples in her head, from that hit.”\n\nHuerta, who suffered an injury to the head that required staples and a large abrasion on her back from being dragged down the street, told KTLA that the incident has left her scared and still in pain.\n\nVargas grew emotional when talking about how scared he was for his wife’s safety.\n\n“He had showed me that he got new equipment, and I thought that was a Christmas present and then he was going to start crying, and I was like, ‘What’s wrong?’ He said that his wife got beaten and robbed of their equipment. He showed me their truck and the chain that they had broke,” Ruiz told KTLA.\n\nIn all, it cost the couple about $1,500 to replace the equipment that was stolen during the ordeal.\n\nStarbucks employee delivers coffee to L.A. deputy with hand-drawn pig on cup\n\n“When he showed me the pictures, I was super upset,’ Ruiz added. “These families are hard-working, and we have a lot of things going on with this immigration right now and it’s just sad to see that someone would rob them of what’s bringing their livelihood.”\n\nThe incident was reported to police and the search is on for the two suspects involved in the violent robbery.\n\n“I hope whoever did it, they catch them, but more importantly that the family is able to recover,” Ruiz said. “Not just the physical but the emotional trauma that they’re going to experience from this.”\n\nWhile the couple is already back to work just days after the harrowing incident, community members organized a GoFundMe to help them recoup their losses and provide for their family during the recovery.",

    "fullText": "Authorities in Westminster, a suburb in Orange County, are looking to spread awareness of vandalism at the Westminster Mall, which closed last October but has since become a hotbed of illicit activity.\n\nAccording to the Westminster Police Department, the mall has been boarded up since its closure; however, people still are finding ways to enter. One look inside shows that trespassers have trashed the mall, smashing glass storefronts, throwing leftover merchandise around and spray painting much of the interior.\n\nWestminster police say that, since the mall shut down, their department has received 402 calls for service for various crimes, including vandalism and trespassing. Individuals with arrest warrants have also been apprehended there, per WPD.\n\nA witness told KTLA that this weekend, they saw around 60 people in the mall at once — with no police or security in sight. They submitted pictures and video of the damaged mall but insisted they were “only there for footage” and did not participate in the vandalism.\n\nJust this past weekend, at least 30 people were arrested for vandalism, a Westminster Police Department spokesperson confirmed to KTLA. The spokesperson added that investigators believe the recent uptick in incidents may have to do with videos circulating online that show the vandalized interior.\n\nHowever, those videos are not an invitation to enter the mall, the spokesperson stated.\n\n“This has become a safety issue,” they said. “Anyone trespassing will get arrested.”",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're discussing the proposed tax on billionaires that's dividing the tech elite.",
    "fullText": "California's billionaires are at a crossroads.\n\nOne of the biggest business stories kicking off the year is the proposed wealth tax in California. The state's rich and powerful, worth more than $1 billion, would face a one-time 5% tax on their assets if the plan gets approved.\n\nThe proposal, which aims to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit, has prompted plenty of grumbling among the California elite.\n\nAs Business Insider first reported, some have already taken action, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nPage converted his secretive family office out of California in late December and incorporated it in Delaware, according to my colleague Hugh Langley's exclusive reporting. Page also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures. He lists principal office addresses outside of California for those entities.\n\nSeparately, an entity tied to both Brin and Page moved out of California at the end of 2025.\n\nThe timing of these moves is crucial. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. Hence, the rush to move assets before the end of the year.\n\nBrin and Page are two of the richest people on the planet, with a combined net worth north of half a trillion dollars, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang struck a very different tone. He said he's \"perfectly fine\" with the tax and gave no indication he plans to leave Silicon Valley, even if it costs him.\n\nOthers are more pessimistic. LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman called the proposal \"horrendous\" for innovation, warning that poorly designed wealth taxes don't raise reliable revenue — they push money and talent elsewhere.\n\nAlex Spiro, the celebrity lawyer who represents several billionaires, sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom last month warning that the tax would drive capital and innovation out of California.\n\nEarlier this month, White House AI Czar David Sacks predicted Austin would overtake San Francisco as the American tech hub. His social media post ricocheted throughout tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from traditionalists.\n\nWhere do you stand on the proposed billionaire's tax in California?

    "description": "Sergey Brin is joining his Google co-founder, Larry Page, in reducing ties to the state where they built their fortunes.",
    "fullText": "For nearly three decades, Google has been steeped in the lore of Silicon Valley.\n\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin, two Stanford University graduate students, created the search engine in 1998 and built the start-up out of a friend’s garage in Menlo Park, Calif. Over time, Google became a nearly $4 trillion juggernaut, helping to cement the Northern California region as the global epicenter of the internet industry.\n\nNow, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page are cutting some ties with the state where they made their fortunes.\n\nIn the 10 days before Christmas, an entity connected to Mr. Brin, 52, terminated or moved 15 California limited liability companies that oversee some of his business interests and investments out of the state, according to documents seen by The New York Times. Seven of the companies — including those that appear to manage one of Mr. Brin’s superyachts and his interest in a private air terminal at San Jose’s international airport — were converted into Nevada entities.\n\nMr. Brin is joining Mr. Page, 52, in reducing his California presence. More than 45 California limited liability companies associated with Mr. Page filed documents last month to either become inactive or move out of the state, according to state records. A trust with ties to Mr. Page also purchased a $71.9 million mansion in Miami’s Coconut Grove neighborhood this week, according to a deed seen by The Times.\n\nAnother entity jointly managed by Mr. Brin and Mr. Page moved out of California and to Nevada on Christmas Eve, according to a filing seen by The Times.\n\nThe Google founders’ shrinking connections to California underscore the impact of a potential ballot measure that would affect the state’s wealthiest residents. Proposed by a health care union, the measure calls for Californians worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax that would be equivalent of 5 percent of their assets. If the measure gains enough signatures to reach the state ballot in November and wins approval, it would retroactively apply to anyone who lived in the state as of Jan. 1 and they would have five years to pay it.\n\nThe potential wealth tax has already caused some California billionaires to establish more ties outside the state. Last month, the venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment firm in Miami. David Sacks, the tech investor and White House adviser on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.\n\nBut the actions of Mr. Brin and Mr. Page stand out because of their wealth — their combined net worths total more than $518 billion, as estimated by Forbes — and how closely identified they are with California. While both stepped down from day-to-day management of Google and its parent, Alphabet, in 2019, they remain on the board of the company and Mr. Brin has recently become more active in Google’s A.I. efforts.\n\nMr. Brin and Mr. Page still have connections to California, including homes across the state. It’s unclear how much time they will be spending in the state this year.\n\nA representative for Mr. Brin declined to comment. Google and representatives for Mr. Page did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on Mr. Page’s Miami home purchase and Business Insider reported on some details of the shifting of Mr. Page and Mr. Brin’s companies.\n\nThe ballot initiative, which was proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system, has elicited a broad spectrum of reactions.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has called the measure bad policy, arguing that it will lead billionaires to simply move to tax-friendlier states. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, has defended the initiative, drawing criticism from tech investors and entrepreneurs who are discussing funding a challenger to his seat.\n\nOthers have said the proposed tax could drive entrepreneurs and investors out of California, which could then stifle innovation. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and a Silicon Valley resident, said the measure was a “horrendous idea” that might force founders and executives to sell shares in companies that they run simply to fulfill the tax obligation.\n\n“Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue,” Mr. Hoffman posted on social media on Wednesday. Mr. Hoffman’s spokeswoman said he was not available for comment.\n\nJensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia and one of California’s wealthiest men, was among the few billionaires who publicly said they accepted the wealth tax. “We chose to live in Silicon Valley and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, adding that he was “perfectly fine” with it.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesman declined to comment.\n\nIn a statement, Suzanne Jimenez, chief of staff at Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, said an exodus of billionaires from California was overblown.\n\n“The overwhelming majority of billionaires have chosen to stay in California past the Jan. 1 deadline,” she said. “Only a very small percentage left before the deadline, despite weeks of Chicken Little talking points claiming a modest tax would trigger a mass departure.”\n\nKirsten Noyes and Georgia Gee contributed research.",

    "fullText": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said the state faces a $2.9 billion budget deficit this year, an amount significantly lower than what legislative budget analysts projected.\n\nThe deficit, though small, could still require cuts and means the Democratic governor doesn’t have money to advance new programs during his last year in office.\n\nIt’s the fourth year in a row that the nation’s most populous state faces a multibillion-dollar budget deficit. This year's shortfall comes despite growing revenues fueled by stock market gains and investments in artificial intelligence.\n\nNewsom's office outlined a behemoth $349 billion budget, though his proposal for how to spend all of that money is far from final. Lawmakers and the Democratic governor will spend the next several months fighting and negotiating over priorities — and cuts. Last year Democrats had to roll back their ambitious program to provide free health care to immigrants without legal status in the face of a $12 billion deficit.\n\n“This budget really is about an eye towards ensuring that we have a sustainable fiscal plan going forward,” Finance Director Joe Stephenshaw said during a Friday briefing.\n\nThis year, they will also face a $1.4 billion loss in federal funding after new federal policy changes to health care and food assistance programs for low-income people. Lawmakers have said repeatedly California is in no position to backfill that money. The budget doesn't fully address the federal funding loss.\n\nNewsom will try to safeguard some of the progressive policies that have defined his tenure as he considers a presidential run. But lawmakers have to consider the looming structural deficit that could climb to $22 billion the following year. Newsom can't seek a third term and will leave office in January.\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office in November projected California to face a $18 billion shortfall this year. Their estimate and Newsom's sometimes differ.\n\nNewsom's administration said some of the deficit was offset recently after the state racked in billion of dollars \n\nStill, State Controller Malia Cohen this week warned lawmakers that the state is already spending nearly $6 billion more than expected six months into the fiscal year. She urged them to take “a disciplined approach.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers said the problem is nothing new. They have little say in the budget process because Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers.\n\n“California families have to balance their budgets and make tough choices. The state government should be held to the same standards,” Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers said they're committed to addressing deficits.\n\n\"During these times of uncertainty, we must craft a responsible budget that prioritizes the safety and fiscal stability of California families,” state Senate President Pro Tempore Monique Limón said in a statement.\n\nNewsom on Thursday during his State of the State address said his budget will include “the most significant investments” in public education.\n\nHe plans to fully fund transitional kindergarten programs for all students, spend more than $27,000 per student next year and provide $1 billion to high-need schools. Based on a complex set of formulas, roughly 40% of the state's budget is required by California law to go to schools every year.\n\nNewsom also proposed to move the Department of Education into the executive branch. The state superintendent of public instruction is an elected position, and it's not immediately clear whether Newsom will ask voters to approve the change.\n\nHe doesn't propose any new funding to local governments to address homelessness. Last year, Newsom and lawmakers agreed to set aside $500 million for the local programs but it's not guaranteed.\n\nCounty officials worry the lack of new funding will hurt efforts to reduce homelessness. The programs are working, California State Association of Counties CEO Graham Knaus said, pointing to a 9% drop in unsheltered homelessness that Newsom touted earlier this week.\n\n“It would make no sense to then stop the most successful program that is doing that,” he said Friday.\n\nNewsom also calls for the state to rebuild its reserves after withdrawing roughly $12 billion in the last two years to solve budget problems.\n\nHe wants to deposit roughly $3 billion into the state’s rainy day fund, $4.5 billion into a special fund for economic emergencies and $4.1 billion in schools' reserve funds.\n\nHe also wants the state to use $3 billion to pay down debt.\n\nThe budget proposal includes $200 million to create a rebate program to make buying an electric car more affordable.\n\nThe money comes from revenues generated by the state’s cap-and-trade program and an air pollution regulation fund. The goal is to backfill federal tax incentives for electric vehicles that were slashed by Trump’s massive tax and spending cut bill.\n\nNewsom also wants to give more money to the state's Department of Justice to help the state fight the Trump administration's agenda. California has sued the administration more than 50 times since last year.",

    "fullText": "Receipts for a “secret menu” item and a separate order of French fries are among the evidence Glendale police shared from their investigation into an alleged counterfeit money scheme that targeted about a dozen In-N-Out Burger locations in Southern California.\n\nAuriona Lewis, 24, and Tatiyanna Foster, 26, both of Long Beach, face felony charges of counterfeiting and grand theft.\n\nThe investigation began Oct. 21, 2025, after an incident at a Glendale In-N-Out, police announced Friday, which detectives later connected to a broader pattern targeting In-N-Out locations throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties.\n\n“Investigators learned that the suspects had successfully victimized approximately a dozen restaurants by using counterfeit bills, resulting in financial losses and operational disruptions to the businesses,” police said.\n\nThe department released photos of counterfeit $100 bills and two receipts from Sept. 29, 2025. One was for a Flying Dutchman, a popular secret menu item consisting of two beef patties and two slices of cheese with no bun, totaling $5.93. It was paid for with a $100 bill, with the customer presumably pocketing the change.\n\nThe other receipt was for a $2.53 order of fries, also paid for with a $100 bill. Police also released In-N-Out security camera photos showing a suspect passing the bills to an employee.\n\nGlendale police financial crimes detectives, K-9 officers and U.S. Marshals arrested Lewis on Oct. 30 in Palmdale, where they said she had counterfeit bills matching those used in the Glendale case, along with numerous gift cards and receipts “believed to be connected to similar fraudulent activity.”\n\nFoster was arrested in December when she appeared at the Glendale Police Department.\n\n“This case underscores the importance of taking financial crimes seriously, regardless of dollar amount,” police said. “Counterfeit currency schemes directly impact local businesses and employees, and swift investigative action helped stop ongoing criminal activity and prevent further victimization.”\n\nThe department encouraged businesses to promptly report suspected counterfeit currency incidents.",

One team member crawled inside and fired paintballs filled with vegetable oil, wildlife organization BEAR League told Fox News Digital on Thursday.\n\nAccording to surveillance video, the large bear has been wedging itself in and out of a small crawl space beneath Ken Johnson’s house since late November. Johnson said that the animal caused extensive damage to his home, costing tens of thousands of dollars. It also created a dangerous, unlivable situation involving structural and gas line issues.\n\n\"Right after surviving the Eaton fire, I lost my job, and shortly after that the bear began tearing into the structure of my home,\" Johnson said in a GoFundMe page. \"I have video footage of it twisting gas pipes, which created an extremely dangerous situation and forced me to shut off my utilities just to stay safe.\"\n\nBear Remains Under California Home After Weeks Of Failed Removal Attempts\n\nThe bear eviction finally took place after Johnson contacted BEAR League, an organization that specializes in bear removal emergencies in Lake Tahoe, located seven hours north of Altadena.\n\nBEAR League told Fox News Digital on Thursday that the organization was \"pleased to have helped Ken Johnson with this bear.\"\n\n\"A Southern California homeowner had a large male bear living under his house for more than a month before reaching out to the BEAR League for help,\" the organization added in a post on Facebook on Thursday.\n\nBEAR League told Fox News Digital that the league used paintballs filled with vegetable oil that hit the bear in the backside. The wildlife rescue group reportedly finished the job in less than 20 minutes.\n\nWild Bear Makes 'Very Polite' Surprise Visit To California Zoo Before Returning To Forest\n\n\"After earlier removal attempts by state wildlife officials were unsuccessful, BEAR League first responders Scott and Dave traveled to the Los Angeles area to assist,\" the organization added. \"Scott, one of our most experienced responders, crawled beneath the home—fully aware the bear was still there—to get behind him and encourage him to exit through the crawl space opening.\"\n\nTo prevent the bear from denning in the crawl space again, the organization said it \"loaned electric unwelcome mats to give the homeowner time to make repairs and secure the crawl space to prevent another visit.\"\n\nAccording to social media footage posted by the organization, the mat worked just as designed, and the bear scurried away when it returned.\n\nBEAR League emphasized that residents should be cautious about having open crawl spaces, noting that properly securing them helps people coexist safely with wildlife.\n\n\"We remind those who live in bear country that a poorly-secured crawl space is an open invitation for a winter visitor like this bear,\" the league said to Fox News Digital. \"BEAR League responds multiple times per day at this time of year to evict bears from under homes in the Lake Tahoe region, and we’ve done so for 30 years without cost to the homeowner.  We work hard to educate people who share space with the bears that if humans take some very simple steps, they can live in harmony with the bears.\"\n\nTuesday’s success ended a long streak of failed eviction attempts by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which had been trying to remove the bear for over a month. At one point, a trap even caught the wrong bear. Efforts that included bait, noisemakers and even a trap that caught the wrong bear all failed.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "The Ohio Bobcats won 30 games across the past three seasons and one player pertinent to that success is headed elsewhere.\n\nOhio’s star wide receiver Chase Hendricks found his transfer portal destination, committing to California after three years as a Bobcat. In three seasons, Hendricks accumulated 1,616 yards and eight touchdowns on 122 receptions, with the majority of his production transpiring in 2024.\n\nHendricks led the entire MAC in receiving yards at 1,037 in a breakout 2025 campaign, while also checking in at second in the conference in receptions (71) and tied for fourth in receiving touchdowns (7). He served as the overwhelming No. 1 target for the 9-4 Bobcats, as the next closest teammate had 30 receptions and 419 yards receiving. 2025 marked Hendricks’ first year in the WR1 role, and it was clear from the opening drive in Week 1 that he’d be poised for a stellar season.\n\nHe produced 100 receiving yards in six of his first eight games this season and snagged 8+ receptions five times (maxing out at 10 vs. Northern Illinois and Eastern Michigan). Hendricks concluded his three-year Ohio stint with an 87-yard outing in a Frisco Bowl victory over UNLV, which represented the Bobcats’ sixth-straight bowl win.\n\nIn 2024, Hendricks was second on the team in receptions (40) and receiving yards (471) for a MAC champion Ohio team. He also earned playing time as a true freshman in 2023, recording 11 catches and 108 yards for a 10-3 Bobcat squad.\n\nThe St. Louis, MO native heads west to California where he joins a loaded Golden Bears receiving corps that features Rutgers transfer Ian Strong and 2025 FBS receptions leader Jacob De Jesus. As for Ohio, the Bobcats now must find a new No. 1 wide receiver — and 2026 will present the team’s fourth different receiving yards leader in four years. Ohio’s second-leading receiver Rodney Harris II is also in the transfer portal, leaving Dom Dorwart (11 receptions and 119 receiving yards in 2025) as the leading returner in production.",

    "title": "Google billionaire Larry Page copies the Jeff Bezos playbook, buying a $173 million Miami compound that will save him millions in taxes",
    "description": "Critics warned a wealth tax in California would lead to a billionaire exodus. Florida says come on in, the water's warm.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page has quietly—or loudly—joined the billionaire exodus from California, shifting businesses east and dropping about $173 million on two ultra-luxury waterfront mansions in Miami’s Coconut Grove in a move that looks strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos’ relocation playbook. The timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look downright Bezos-ian.​\n\nIn late December and early January, The Wall Street Journal reported, Page snapped up two neighboring estates in Miami’s Coconut Grove, paying roughly $101.5 million for one waterfront compound and $71.9 million for another in an off‑market deal, for a combined outlay of about $173.4 million. One of the homes, previously listed for $135 million, spans 13 bedrooms and 15.5 bathrooms and sits directly on the water, while the second, bought from heiress Sloan Lindemann Barnett and her husband Roger Barnett, nearly doubled in value in less than five years.​\n\nThe purchases plant Page squarely inside one of Miami’s most exclusive enclaves, long favored by global elites seeking privacy, water access, and low‑key luxury. Local brokers say his splashy entry is part of a broader surge of high‑net‑worth Californians scouting Coconut Grove and other South Florida neighborhoods as they hedge against looming tax changes while upgrading to trophy waterfront properties. The real-estate purchases double as both a luxury retreat and a massive tax‑savings vehicle, with Page the most prominent of California’s ultrawealthy choosing to leave as state lawmakers are targeting fortunes like his with an aggressive wealth‑tax push.\n\nBehind the real-estate headlines, Page has been methodically severing his financial and legal ties to California ahead of a proposed wealth tax that targets residents worth more than $1 billion. Regulatory filings show he has moved his family office and several investment and holding entities out of the state, Business Insider reported, reincorporating key vehicles in Delaware and listing new business addresses in Florida.​\n\nThe New York Times previously reported Page had been telling associates he was considering Florida specifically because of a proposed ballot measure that would impose a 5% annual levy on the worldwide assets of billionaires domiciled in California. If passed and applied retroactively to residents as of Jan. 1, 2026, analysts estimate the tax could cost Page—currently ranked as the world’s second‑richest person—well over $10 billion.\n\n​​Some Silicon Valley executives, notably Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, warned such an outcome was possible, saying in late December founders would have to sell off parts of their companies to pay for “fraud, waste, and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.” California Rep. Ro Khanna responded to the Times‘ reporting that Page and Peter Thiel were looking to leave by flagging the story on X and saying, seemingly sarcastically in the style of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “I will miss them very much.”",

    "fullText": "A 550-pound black bear that had been living under an Altadena man’s home for more than a month has finally been removed, thanks to help from a wildlife rescue group.\n\n“I’m relieved – no more banging under the house and smelling him and wondering what’s going on under there,” Ken Johnson, the homeowner, told KTLA’s Jillian Smukler on Thursday.\n\nJohnson said the bear took up residence in the crawlspace beneath his home just before Thanksgiving, and repeated efforts to coax it out didn’t work.\n\nState wildlife officials tried to remove the bear using paintball guns, air horns and other tactics – but were unsuccessful. Johnson said the effort stalled after officials received instructions from Sacramento to pull back.\n\nAfter that, he threatened to sue the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for negligence and emotional distress.\n\nThe breakthrough, however, came when the BEAR League, a nonprofit based in Lake Tahoe, offered to help at no cost. The team, Johnson said, used similar methods to those employed by state agencies – paintball guns – but completed the job in about 10 minutes on Tuesday.\n\n“I couldn’t believe it was so fast,” Johnson said. “These guys went in, they crawled in behind him and, boom, he was out.”\n\nWhen the bear returned two nights later to climb back into the crawlspace, it encountered an electrified mat over the opening that gave it a small shock — so it took off. Only time will tell if it’s gone for good.\n\nJohnson described the removal as a “late Christmas gift.” He can now assess the damage the bear caused underneath his home, which includes a ruptured gas line.",

    "description": "Larry Page is leaving California ahead of the proposed billionaire's tax, and Jensen Huang is staying. It shows different appetites for risk.",
    "fullText": "It's a classic fight-or-flight response — with a billionaire's twist.\n\nA proposed wealth tax in California prompted the state's resident billionaires to consider whether they wanted to continue their residency if the one-time 5% tax is approved.\n\nTheir reactions, said CFP professional Don Hilario, who works with financial planning clients in California, boil down to risk tolerance.\n\nThe tax, as proposed, would only apply to assets in the state during the 2026 tax year. Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin moved assets out of California ahead of the January 1, 2026, deadline to avoid facing the tax, Business Insider first reported. Meanwhile, Nvidia's billionaire CEO Jensen Huang said he has \"not even thought about it once.\"\n\n\"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,\" Huang told Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow. \"I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\nHilario, whose financial planning clients include individuals in Big Tech, said that the lingering uncertainty of the tax can trigger a need for certainty and autonomy.\n\n\"People who want to have a greater sense of control will do the Larry Page route,\" he said, \"versus people who have the temperament to endure will take Jensen's route.\"\n\nHilario described a hypothetical scenario in which individuals with high net worths are considering purchasing a home. In a period where the economy and interest rates are uncertain, do you want to put the lion's share of your expenses toward the home in the event that rates will be higher in the future, or do you hold out and continue accumulating your wealth in the event that economic conditions improve?\n\n\"That's the same type of emotions that exist with this tax bill because the fear of not taking any action is unsettling,\" Hilario said.\n\nThe proposal, put forth by the union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West to offset potential budget cuts to healthcare and education, is far from being implemented — it would require 870,000 signatures to make it onto the November 2026 ballot.\n\nThe SEIU said in its proposal that the concentration of billionaire wealth in California makes the state \"uniquely positioned to address both the well-documented crisis of wealth inequality in the United States and the emerging and interrelated crises the state faces\" with the budget cuts.\n\nIn addition to Huang, Brin, and Page, other billionaires are voicing their opinions on the proposed wealth tax. LinkedIn's cofounder, Reid Hoffman, wrote in a post on X that the proposal has \"massive flaws.\"\n\n\"Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue,\" he said.\n\nAlex Spiro, an attorney who has previously represented billionaires, wrote in a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom that his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the tax were to become law. Hilario said that the significant uncertainty surrounding the proposal, including how assets will be valued and whether the tax would change over time, likely forced billionaires to decide how risk-averse they really are.\n\n\"I still think ultimately it's unclear. And I think when it's unclear, it'll make people, in this case, investors, be more cautious and defensive,\" Hilario said. \"And then a big part of it is, how do we respond emotionally? I think whether you're taking early action or enduring, you do want to gather information and avoid making a decision that would ultimately be irreversible.\"",

    "description": "The LLC moved as California's ultrarich weigh leaving ahead of a proposed tax on billionaires that would take effect retroactively starting January 1.",
    "fullText": "An entity tied to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page moved out of California at the end of 2025, beating the deadline on a proposed wealth tax of the state's rich and powerful.\n\nT-Rex LLC, formed in 2006 and linked to Brin and Page, converted out of California into a Delaware LLC called T-Rex Holdings on December 24, 2025, according to a California filing reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPrior filings over the past 20 years listed Brin and Page as managers of the LLC at a Palo Alto address. In the conversion filing, T-Rex Holdings listed an address in Reno, Nevada, as its principal office, with Brin and Page both remaining managers.\n\nRepresentatives for Brin and Page didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe move comes as California's wealthiest residents are weighing whether to leave the state. A proposed ballot measure would make the roughly 200 California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion pay a one-time 5% tax. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. The measure attempts to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nEarlier this week, Business Insider first reported that Page severed ties with California in late December by converting his family office out of the state and incorporating it in Delaware. He has also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures.\n\nIt's unclear what the entity tied to Brin and Page does. The filing describes T-Rex Holdings as a \"management company.\" Like other ultrawealthy executives, Brin and Page have used LLCs as flexible vehicles to hold assets or manage investments, often with little public disclosure. The LLC's name may be a reference to Stan, a bronze T. rex statue that presides over Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nBrin, who cofounded Google with Page in 1998, is associated with several other entities in California, including the Sergey Brin Family Foundation and Bayshore Global Management, which acts as his family office. Filings do not show any other entity associated with Brin leaving California.\n\nPage and Brin are, respectively, the second and fourth-richest people on the planet, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Each has a net worth exceeding $250 billion.\n\nAfter stepping back from executive roles in 2019, the two have taken differing paths. Brin has returned to hands-on work at Google. Page is a controlling shareholder, but has remained outside the company's daily operations.\n\nIf the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November. If approved by voters, it will apply retroactively to the beginning of the year, meaning those who wish to avoid the tax would need to have been out of the state by the end of December 2025.\n\nCalifornia law determines residency based a variety of factors, including time spent in California and any substantial business dealings.\n\nA December 11 letter from celebrity attorney Alex Spiro to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, seen by Business Insider, urged the governor to stop the proposed tax: \"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"",

    "fullText": "State residents worth more than $1bn could face one-off, 5% tax to help fund education, food assistance and healthcare\n\nA battle is brewing in California over a plan to tax billionaires – with tech titans divided over whether they should pay up, or flee the state.\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\n“We chose to live in Silicon Valley,” Huang said. “And whatever taxes I guess they would like to apply, so be it.”\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with Google co-founder Larry Page, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they’re leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nThe tax proposal is being led by the labor union Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. If passed, the tax would retroactively apply to residents as of 1 January, and billionaires would have five years to pay it.\n\nThis means Huang would pay roughly $7bn and Page and Thiel would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $1.3bn, respectively, based on their current net worth.\n\n“What remains undeniable is the underlying unfairness of the current system,” Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for SEIU-UHW, said in an email. “Regular working people pay higher effective tax rates than the wealthiest Americans … Asking those who have benefited most from the economy to contribute more – particularly to stabilize health care systems under direct threat – is a reasonable step.”\n\nThe proposal is still in the beginning phases. Under California law, it needs to collect 874,641 signatures to qualify for the state ballot in November. It would also need to be signed by California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who has said he opposes the wealth tax.\n\n“You can’t isolate yourself from the 49 others,” Newsom said when asked about wealth taxes during the New York Times DealBook Summit last month. “We’re in a competitive environment.”\n\nThis puts Newsom at odds with Ro Khanna, the California representative who represents Silicon Valley and who has championed the idea of a wealth tax. Khanna says tech billionaires will likely stay in the state, despite a tax, because California is where the larger industry, innovation and talent pool are located. “A billionaire tax is good for American innovation,” Khanna said, adding that it would spread the wealth to other sectors.\n\nWhen Thiel indicated he was leaving California because of the proposed tax, Khanna posted to X: “I echo what FDR said with sarcasm of economic royalists when they threatened to leave, ‘I will miss them very much.’”\n\nThis is not California’s first billionaire exodus. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, famously departed for Texas in 2020, which stood to save him millions in taxes. He has also shifted several of his companies’ headquarters there. Most recently, in 2024, Musk announced he was moving SpaceX to Texas because of a California law that aimed to protect transgender children in schools. He called the law a “final straw”.\n\nOther tech billionaires have also decamped to Texas, which has no state income tax. Citing a better tax environment, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale moved to Austin in 2020, and Larry Ellison transitioned Oracle’s headquarters there in 2020 (he has since said he’s moving the company to Nashville). Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Technologies, has long lived in Texas.\n\nSacks made his announcement on 31 December, posting an image of the Texas flag on X and saying: “God bless Texas.” In a separate post the following day, Sacks wrote: “As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.”\n\nMusk, Lonsdale and Dell all responded with hearty welcomes. “No one will fight harder for the independent and free spirit of Texas than people who know [sic] it’s like when that’s taken away,” Musk wrote.\n\nPage has not publicly said where he’s moving, but in December companies associated with the Google co-founder filed documents to incorporate in Florida, according to the New York Times. Thiel, who owns a home in the Hollywood Hills, also seems to have set his sights on Florida. His investment firm, Thiel Capital, announced on 31 December that it had opened an office in Miami. The firm said Thiel has maintained a personal residence in the city since 2020.\n\nOn X, tech investors and other billionaires have blasted the proposed wealth tax. Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and former Facebook executive, said that without billionaires, California’s “budget deficit will only get bigger”, and Vinod Khosla, another investor, said that under the proposed tax, “California will lose its most important taxpayers and net off much worse”.\n\nSome have indicated they’d work to oust Khanna from Congress. Martin Casado, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote that Khanna had “devolved into an obnoxious jerk” and that his support of the wealth tax had alienated him from moderates. In response, Garry Tan, the CEO of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, wrote: “Time to primary him.”\n\nThe SEIU’s Jimenez said states like Massachusetts and Washington, which have other forms of wealth taxes, have seen billions of dollars raised to help the state. At the same time, she said, high-income residents have continued to see their portfolios grow. Jimenez added that the union is “heartened” by Huang’s recent comments and is hopeful that more billionaires will follow suit.\n\nAs for Huang, he said Nvidia is in Silicon Valley because that’s where the engineers are and he’s not worried about a billionaire tax.\n\n“Not this person,” Huang said. “This person is trying to build the future of AI.”\n\nRepresentatives for Page, Thiel, Sacks and Newsom did not return requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Reid Hoffman isn't a fan of California's proposed wealth tax, and he said he let Rep. Mo Khanna know about it during a recent conversation.\n\nIn a post on X, the LinkedIn cofounder — and prominent Democratic donor — said Rep. Mo Khanna had reached out to discuss the proposed tax, which would impose a 5% tax on billionaires in the state of California. Hoffman called the proposal \"badly designed\" with \"massive flaws\" that would be \"horrendous\" for innovation.\n\n\"The proposed CA wealth tax is badly designed in so many ways that a simple social post cannot cover all of the massive flaws,\" Hoffman wrote. \"One well-documented example is the horrendous idea to tax illiquid stock in the proposal. Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue.\"\n\nHe said that, after the conversation, he believes Khanna sees Silicon Valley as \"a massively important creation of the future,\" adding that the congressman wants to \"preserve and evolve capitalism\" through the proposed tax.\n\n\"It is true that we need to preserve and grow the incredible creation and generativity of Silicon Valley,\" Hoffman wrote. \"It is also true that we must figure out how to help people who have not benefited from the wealth, jobs, and company creation engine of Silicon Valley thus far.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Khanna wrote that he appreciated \"the excellent dialogue\" with Hoffman.\n\n\"You summarized my goal and aspiration correctly!\" Khanna said.\n\nSilicon Valley superstars have been split on the proposed wealth tax. Some prominent figures in tech, like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, have come out in support of the proposal, while others have sharply criticized it.\n\nGoogle's Larry Page moved several of his assets and his businesses out of the state ahead of an end-of-2025 deadline that would have risked exposing him to the proposed tax, Business Insider exclusively reported on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "It’s that time of year again when coyote sightings increase and officials offer tips on how to keep them away from homes.\n\nThe reason you’re more likely to see coyotes in many parts of Southern California later this month isn’t surprising: coyote breeding season typically runs from late January through March. Knowing this can help residents and pet owners prepare in advance.\n\n“During this time, adult coyotes travel long distances in search of mates and food sources, resulting in more sightings,” the Huntington Beach Police Department posted Tuesday.\n\nA coyote attack on a toddler near Huntington Beach Pier made headlines in April 2022, not long after the typical mating season. A family was out by the pier around 9:45 p.m. when the 2-year-old girl was attacked.\n\nThe coyote bit the girl and knocked her down, leaving her with injuries described as non-life-threatening. Huntington Beach police officers were called to the scene, where they found two coyotes nearby and shot them both.\n\nThat same year, the city issued its Coyote Management Plan to help the community safely coexist with urban coyotes.\n\nCoyotes, which are native to California, eat a broad range of small animals, including mice, rats and gophers. “Rodents make up a majority of their diet. In the process, they control the population sizes of these animals, many of which are considered pests to humans,” the city’s plan states.\n\nUnfortunately, urban coyotes are also known to go after small pets or even children and can be attracted into neighborhoods by pet food, unsecured compost or trash, and fallen fruit.\n\nCut back vegetation that may create hiding places and shelters.\n\nQuickly harvest ripe or fallen fruit and vegetables.\n\nPick up trash and keep lids closed.\n\nKeep garbage inside a garage or secure building until pickup day.\n\nPet owners are urged not to leave small dogs outside unattended, as they may be seen as potential prey.\n\n“It is important to either keep dogs on a six-foot-long or shorter leash when outdoors or to stay within six feet of them when on your property. Coyotes may view a dog on a leash longer than six feet as an unattended pet,” officials said.\n\nProtect cats and small dogs from coyotes:\n\nWhen outside, accompany them or keep them on a leash or harness.\n\n“People who feed feral cats are often concerned that coyotes might prey on the cats,” officials said. “These concerns are well-founded, as coyotes can be attracted to outdoor pet food.”\n\nMore information, including a checklist to make your home uninviting to coyotes, is available on the Coyote Management Plan.",

Another vintage piece — maybe from the '70s instead of the '50s — might have worked better.\n\nDolce & Gabbana designed the three-piece set he wore. It included loose-fitting velvet pants, a matching blazer with a satin lining, and a soft vest worn underneath.\n\nThe suit was complemented by black velvet loafers, aviator sunglasses, a satin undershirt, and an assortment of fine jewelry from David Yurman.\n\nColman's outfit was chic, on trend, and the epitome of quiet luxury.\n\nThe \"Happy Gilmore\" star posed on the red carpet wearing a jewel-toned suit with a matching purple tie. Though the outfit was eye-catching, it was also arguably too flashy.\n\nHis wife, Jackie Sandler, had a stronger fashion moment in a strapless, gold gown with a black lace overlay. Still, her outfit would have been stronger if she'd worn a darker slip beneath the top layer.\n\nHer dark ensemble was designed by Haider Ackermann for Tom Ford.\n\nIt featured pleated trousers that were tailored perfectly to the musician, a satin blazer with sharp shoulder pads, and a polka-dot blouse with a plunging neckline that reached her stomach.\n\nHe wore a classic suit for the film festival, pairing a black blazer and trousers with a white undershirt and tie.\n\nThough he undoubtedly looked dapper at the event's red carpet, his outfit was too understated. It's unlikely to be remembered alongside brighter, more artistic fashion choices.\n\nShe wore a sparkling Georges Chakra gown. The semi-sheer piece had a sleeveless, backless bodice with a deep V-shaped neckline, a floor-length skirt, and a wrap belt that draped across the floor.\n\nThe dress proved that red is Hudson's color.\n\nThe actor attended the festival in a strapless, leather midi dress. It had a high-low skirt with delicate pleats and a form-fitting bodice.\n\nUnfortunately, the dress was styled too simply. It would have been more impactful if worn with an updo hairstyle and statement jewelry.",

    "fullText": "I've visited California wine country several times over the past couple of years, including many trips to the iconic Napa Valley.\n\nAnd although I definitely recommend a trip to Napa, there's another nearby wine region that I find myself returning to even more often: Sonoma.\n\nMore than just the city of Sonoma, the entire county feels like its own world. With rolling vineyards, rugged beaches, and redwood forests, it offers so much more than wine alone. Here's why this region stole my heart.\n\nThe region offers everything from relaxed, walk-in spots to high-end tasting rooms with incredible service and excellent wines.\n\nSonoma is also home to one of the oldest premium wineries in California, Buena Vista Winery. Here, I've enjoyed walking the historic grounds, seeing the old vines, and learning some history while I sip.\n\nBeyond great wine, Sonoma also offers unique tasting experiences. At the historic Bartholomew Estate Winery, for example, guests can enjoy a tasting after horseback riding through the vineyards.\n\nI had a similar adventure at Chalk Hill Winery in Healdsburg, where I paired my tasting with a Hummer ride throughout the estate.\n\nSonoma County is home to a diverse range of landscapes, including vineyards, redwood forests, rivers, and beaches.\n\nI love driving along the dramatic coastline and stopping to hike, or spending a few hours on the sand at Sonoma Coast State Park.\n\nIn a single day, I can sip wine, stroll under redwoods, and watch the sun set over the Pacific. In my experience, there aren't many other places where that's possible.\n\nSeveral smaller towns make up Sonoma County, and many of them feel like they were plucked straight from a Hallmark movie.\n\nI love walking and biking through Sonoma's quiet city streets, and grabbing coffee or fish tacos in Bodega Bay.\n\nI also enjoy celebrating the holidays on the festive square in Healdsburg, and wandering around Guerneville, tucked under the majestic redwoods.\n\nEach town has its own personality, and exploring them feels like moving through different little worlds, all connected by the same relaxed, welcoming energy that makes Sonoma so special.\n\nNapa is a popular travel destination, and with reservations recommended at many tasting rooms and restaurants, planning is key.\n\nIn Sonoma County, however, visitors don't always need to plan as far in advance, as many restaurants and wineries accept walk-ins.\n\nOn a recent trip, I visited Gracianna Winery, Overshine Wine Co., Korbel Winery, and Sonoma Coast Vineyards — none of which required a reservation. Each place offered a distinct experience and insight into the local wine scene.",

    "fullText": "Shasta Lake, the largest reservoir in California, rose more than 30 feet over the past two weeks as a series of winter storms pounded the state, according to state data.\n\nThe heavy inflow over the holidays, with Shasta Lake rising 10 feet alone between Friday and Monday, pushed water levels at the sprawling Northern California reservoir to nearly 80% of capacity, which is well above what it typically holds this early in the rainy season. And the runoff is still coming in, albeit at a slower rate.\n\nCalifornia reservoir levels: Charts show water supply across the state\n\nWhile winter is still young and California's water picture won't be clear for months, the recent replenishment of Shasta Lake, as well as other major reservoirs, is welcome news for cities and farms across the state, which rely on the water that fills these giant storage facilities between fall and spring.\n\n\"Reservoirs on the whole are running ahead of average, which is good,\" said Michael Anderson, state climatologist at the California Department of Water Resources, in a report Tuesday to the State Water Resources Control Board.\n\nPrior to the holidays, water managers were getting nervous after a mostly dry start to the state's peak wet season, which runs from December to March. But starting just before Christmas, an extremely wet pattern locked in, bringing more than a foot of rain and several feet of snow to parts of California over a two-week period.\n\n\"Right around the Christmas holiday, we had over 100 hours of atmospheric river conditions in the state,\" Anderson said.\n\nAs a result, water storage at Shasta Lake climbed to 132% of average for the date, as of Monday. Storage at Lake Oroville, the state's second-largest reservoir, rose to 135% of average. Storage at Trinity Lake, the state's third-largest reservoir, hit 137% of average.\n\nHetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite, which is San Francisco's primary storage facility, meanwhile, held 130% of the water it typically holds on this date.\n\nMany reservoirs have been making releases to ensure adequate space for the lingering precipitation and continuing runoff. Shasta Lake's waters were about 35 feet below the rim of the reservoir.\n\n\"We are on the receding limb of inflows with these latest systems,\" said Levi Johnson, an operations manager at the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages Shasta Lake. \"This will be a dynamic operation in terms of what kind of releases we have.\"\n\nThe storms appear to be mostly on their way out. The National Weather Service is forecasting dry conditions for at least the next two weeks.\n\nWhile California's water picture remains strong, water managers will be watching to see how long it is before the next rain and snow arrives and whether it's enough to maintain robust reservoir storage.\n\nAnother factor that water managers are monitoring is snowfall in the state's far north. While California's total snowpack stands at 90% of average for the date, the northern Sierra and southern Cascades are at just 67%.\n\nSnow is important, particularly in Northern California where the state's biggest reservoirs are located, because it melts and provides a source of water for reservoirs after the rainy season ends.\n\n\"We've had a lot more rain than snow,\" Anderson said.\n\nThis article originally published at California's largest reservoir surges 30 feet after recent storms.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang seems like he's not losing sleep over California's proposed wealth tax.\n\nWhen Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow asked Huang about California's proposed 5% billionaire wealth tax in an interview that aired on Tuesday, Huang said that the potential levy hasn't crossed his mind once and that he is \"trying to build the future of AI.\"\n\n\"I've got to tell you, I have not even thought about it once,\" Huang told Ludlow. \"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it. I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\n\"We work in Silicon Valley because that's where the talent pool is,\" Huang added.\n\nHuang is the eighth-wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes, which estimated his net worth at approximately $162.6 billion as of January 6. Most of Huang's wealth comes from his around 3% stake in Nvidia, which just showed off its new Vera Rubin chips at the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nBased on his net worth as reported by Forbes, a 5% tax on his total wealth would amount to more than $8 billion, to be paid over five years, according to the proposed plan.\n\nThe California wealth tax was proposed by the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West in order to offset anticipated budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance.\n\nA wealth tax is different from an income tax and is a levy on an individual's entire net worth instead of annual income. The union estimates that the one-time tax will bring in $100 billion over five years for the state and apply to the around 200 billionaires who are residents of California.\n\nThe proposal is still very far from reality and would need 870,000 signatures to even make it to the ballot in November 2026, where it would then be voted on or rejected by California voters.\n\nBillionaires from Palmer Luckey to David Sacks have already voiced their full-throated disapproval.\n\nAccording to filings viewed by Business Insider, Larry Page, the Google cofounder, converted many of his assets from California to Delaware in December to derisk them from the potential wealth tax. His departure meets an end-of-2025 deadline, since the tax, if passed, would only apply to billionaires who are still residents of California on January 1, 2026.\n\nCelebrity attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of his wealthy clients and warned that they would \"permanently relocate\" if the California billionaire tax comes to pass.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "The Google cofounder has severed ties between California and several of his business entities, including his family office.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Larry Page is peacing out of California.\n\nThe Google cofounder has cut ties between California and many of his assets that risked exposing him to a proposed new wealth tax in the state, meeting an end-of-2025 deadline, according to filings reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPage's family office, Koop, was converted out of California in late December and incorporated in Delaware, per filings with both states. Page converted several other entities to Delaware, including Flu Lab LLC — a vehicle he has used to fund research on tackling influenza and lists its principal office address in Nevada — and another entity named One Aero, which has funded his flying car ventures and lists its principal office address in Florida.\n\nA filing was also made to convert Dynatomics, LLC from California to Delaware with a new principal address in Keller, Texas. Page launched Dynatomics, a new startup focused on applying AI to aircraft manufacturing, in 2023, Business Insider previously reported. A source close to Page said that the team, run by Chris Anderson, continues to work out of California.\n\nAnderson and representatives for Page's family office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe New York Times reported in December that Page had told people he was considering moving to Florida because of a proposed ballot measure that would tax the state's wealthiest residents. The proposal, if passed successfully, would mean that any California resident worth more than $1 billion would be taxed 5% of their assets.\n\nUnder California law, residency is determined by the nature of a person's ties to the state, with factors such as the time spent in the state and the maintenance of substantial business ties taken into account. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nA source close to Page said the Google cofounder had already left the state. Whether Page's move is temporary could not be learned.\n\nPage is ranked the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nBesides his family office and funding vehicles, Page converted out an LLC that Business Insider previously identified as being used to purchase islands in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, from California to Delaware, with a new address listed in Florida.\n\nA separate LLC Page used to purchase an Island in Fiji was also converted out to Delaware.\n\nPage's wife, the scientist Lucinda Southworth, founded a marine-conservation charity named Oceankind. Filings show that Oceankind converted out of California to Delaware in December.\n\nDelaware has become a popular state for businesses to incorporate due to its favorable tax structure, privacy, and its home to a court system specifically designed to handle corporate disputes. The state does not require LLCs to disclose the names and addresses of directors when incorporating, providing them with an extra layer of privacy.\n\nPrivacy is especially important to Page, whose family office is shrouded in a level of secrecy unparalleled by most and carefully managed by its CEO, Wayne Osborne.\n\nCristina Rosado, an attorney who handles many of Page and Southworth's assets, signed several of the California filings.\n\nPage incorporated three entities in Florida last year, as previously reported by The New York Times. A Koop LLC was incorporated in Florida in January 2025, per filings reviewed by Business Insider. It could not be confirmed if it belongs to Page.\n\nThe California billionaire tax proposal faced some opposition from leaders in venture capital and politics. In a post on X in December, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said the proposed measure would mean California would lose its most important taxpayers and \"net off much worse.\"\n\n\"Long term damage unless legislature bans wealth taxes,\" he added. \"Easier to equalize taxes on work income and capital gains at the national level.\n\nMatt Mahan, Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, on Monday described the tax as \"a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy.\"\n\nWhite House AI czar David Sacks has criticized the proposal and said it will backfire. He has also said he believes Miami and Austin will overtake New York and San Francisco for finance and tech, respectively. He announced this month that his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, had opened an office in Austin.\n\nLast month, celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro wrote a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, warning that the proposed billionaire tax would \"trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave something to share?

    "description": "I followed a partner to Texas from California, then left both the state and relationship. I learned an important lesson about making my own decisions.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after earning my Bachelor's degree, I did what any confused 21-year-old would do: I moved to be with a partner.\n\nThe decision surprised a lot of people in my life. My dad raised his eyebrows at my choice to move for love and to make Texas my home.\n\nAfter all, I'd always dreamed of moving to New York, where I'd launch my writing career.\n\nHowever, moving to Texas seemed like a good option at the time. It's where my long-distance partner was living and working, and I was fresh out of college and eager to leave my California hometown.\n\nLooking back now, I was leaning on a romanticized version of what moving would mean — a fresh start and a deepening of our LDR — instead of thinking about what I really wanted.\n\nI arrived in northern Texas during a mid-summer nightmare of humidity. I couldn't walk outside without feeling like I'd just entered a sauna — a sharp contrast to California's dry heat.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I tried to find community and make living here work, convincing myself I'd adjust if I just put in enough effort.\n\nBut I had a tough time finding things to do in my new suburb. Quiet nights and weekends left me daydreaming about New York City and its seemingly endless array of activities and events even more.\n\nCrucially, I also found it incredibly difficult to meet anyone who felt similar to me.\n\nMy Dallas suburb felt much more conservative than my California hometown, and a lot of the people in our neighborhood were avid churchgoers, whereas I'm not religious.\n\nAround this time, too, I was coming to terms with the fact that I also liked women romantically. I struggled to find the kinds of queer spaces that seemed more plentiful in larger cities and bluer states.\n\nAs much as I tried to appreciate the mountainless views and endless selection of barbecue, I struggled to connect with my new town — and I couldn't stop thinking about the life I wanted in New York.\n\nSix months in, I took a quick trip back to California to visit my dad.\n\nTaking some time away from Texas made me confront the truth: I couldn't stay there anymore.\n\nThroughout my entire time in the state, I'd been daydreaming about packing up my things and living in New York City. My partner, on the other hand, wanted life in the country, and we just ended up not being compatible.\n\nThe Lone Star State helped bring all of these realizations to light.\n\nI knew that if I had chosen to stay, I'd continue to feel like a stranger in my own life. I realized that I'd rather take on the \"sunk cost\" of moving than stay in a place and relationship that didn't suit me.\n\nI learned a lot about myself during this time — including the fact that, maybe unsurprisingly, a suburb in northern Texas was not a great long-term fit for me. The biggest lesson I learned, though, was never to give up my own hopes and dreams for the sake of a relationship.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Moving for a partner can work for some people, but at 21, I learned the importance of making life decisions with my own wants and needs in mind.\n\nNow, almost a decade later, I'm writing this from my New York City apartment. I'm in a city where I've found my purpose, the love of my life, and most importantly, happiness.\n\nLeaving Texas turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.",

    "fullText": "California’s East Bay got a shock on the morning of New Year’s Eve when a sleek black Chevrolet Camaro turned a routine patrol on Interstate 580 into something out of a spy movie. At around 8:20 in the morning, officers from the California Highway Patrol spotted a motorist barreling down the highway at speeds well over 100 miles per hour. What happened next has police scratching their heads and asking the public for help identifying the driver and vehicle involved.\n\nFor law enforcement, Interstate 580 can be a daily blur of commuters and big rigs. On this day, though, it was the scene of a high-speed enigma. It’s not a simple case of a Camaro outrunning the officers pursuing it; it also seemed to make its identity vanish. According to the CHP, the vehicle’s license plate went “black” or “turned off” during the chase, depriving authorities of a critical tool used to track down fleeing drivers.\n\nThis odd twist in an otherwise familiar story of speeding and evasion has raised more questions than answers. Social media users wondered if the Camaro was fitted with a so-called digital license plate that can be manipulated remotely.\n\nCalifornia has been at the forefront of experimenting with electronic plates, which are legal when properly registered and used within regulations. Yet the idea that such tech could be exploited to intentionally thwart police tracking naturally grabbed headlines and sparked speculation about potential misuse.\n\nThe CHP’s Dublin area office released a description of the plate itself, noting it was black with yellow or white lettering before it went dark. That limited detail underscores just how little investigators know about the driver or the exact nature of the disappearing tag technology.\n\nLaw enforcement has stopped short of calling it a “hack,” and there’s no indication yet that the plate is illegal in and of itself. But the implication that someone equipped a car with the ability to cloak its identity mid-pursuit is enough to make any patrol vet raise an eyebrow.\n\nTo be clear, this was not a routine stop that turned sour. The Camaro was engaged in what police describe as an extended attempt to flee contact, topping triple-digit speeds as it weaved along the highway. Officials attempted to initiate a traffic stop in the early morning commute, but as so often happens in high-speed chase situations, the driver chose flight over compliance. The report is that the black Camaro is fond of doing over 100 mph.\n\nIn the aftermath, the CHP has appealed directly to the public for tips. Their Facebook post about the incident asked anyone with information to reach out to investigators at the Dublin office. Typically, such pleas signal that law enforcement has not yet identified the suspect or vehicle owner.\n\nIn this case, their language left little doubt that the chase ended with the Camaro slipping out of their grasp. One comment made fun of the authorities, saying, “if you got gapped, you can just say that bro, no shame here.” Most of the comments don’t seem to care:\n\n“Was it a T-top model with a \"screaming chicken\" painted on the hood? Was the diver wearing a cowboy hat and a dark mustache? Oh Camaro... Somehow, I read Trans-AM.”\n\n“I didn’t see nothing, hear nothing, know nothing….”\n\n“Are we on payroll now? They are calling in the Street Detectives.”\n\nIt’s not the first time that high-performance cars have outpaced police vehicles or used unconventional methods to escape. Across the country, high-speed pursuits involving Camaros, Mustangs, and other muscle cars are regular entries in police logs. Some end with arrests, others with crashes.\n\nBut adding technology that directly interferes with standard identification tools marks a new wrinkle, and one that could force legislators and law enforcement agencies to rethink how they monitor and manage such devices.\n\nThe incident also highlights the challenge of pursuing suspects on busy freeways. Officers must balance the need to enforce the law with the safety of other motorists. High-speed chases are inherently dangerous, and when the fleeing vehicle seems to have tools to evade detection, the stakes climb even higher.\n\nAt this point, the Camaro and its driver are still at large. The CHP is seeking help from anyone who witnessed the event or may have seen the vehicle before or after the chase. It remains unclear whether further evidence will surface, but this curious combination of muscle car speed and mysterious plate behavior has already captured the public’s imagination. One of the comments under the FB post was quite lengthy:\n\n“Quit asking the public to do your dirty work… we don’t care… and to be quite honest, the police try to say social media is the best thing that ever happened to law-enforcement because the criminals just snitch on themselves. Well, you guys are letting us know how you do everything … No one knew how you guys did what you did… it is your job to catch us and our job not to get caught. Freedom of speech is crazy, isn’t it?”\n\nIf you saw something that morning on I-580 or know more about the technology that might let a license plate blink out like a cartoon disappearing act, authorities want to hear from you. Anyone with information is urged to contact the CHP Dublin Area Office.",

(AP) — Heavy rain and high tides believed to be the most severe in two decades caused flooding in parts of Northern California on Saturday, prompting road closures and rescues of people trapped in cars.\n\nRoadways through a 15-mile (24-kilometer) stretch from the Sausalito area to San Rafael were flooded after a downpour coincided with record-breaking “ King Tides,” Marin County Sheriff's Sgt. Michael Dobbins said.\n\nAuthorities were called to assist when cars got stuck in water as high as 3 and 4 feet (1.1 and 1.2 meters), Dobbins said.\n\n“There is a lot of water in the roadways,” Dobbins said, adding that the tides were reportedly the highest in more than two decades. “Along with heavy rains, it just created the perfect storm for flooding on the streets.”\n\nAuthorities in the affected communities, which are north of San Francisco, asked people to stay home until waters recede. Some people kayaked along swamped streets, while others waded through water above their knees.\n\nA flood warning was in place for the San Francisco area until 2 p.m. Saturday and an advisory until 2 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, and repeated rounds of rain were expected throughout the state on Sunday and Monday.\n\nTo the south in Santa Barbara County, roads were closed due to flooding and a key highway was blocked near Goleta due to a series of mudslides. A man died after he was swept into a creek during the storm, the county sheriff’s office said.\n\nKing Tides occur when the sun, moon and Earth are in alignment and the moon is in its closest position to the Earth, creating a stronger gravitational pull.",

He also paid tribute to the involved community members and officers within MPD.\n\n“This is a new era for Modesto. This is not the same city it was 10 or 15 years ago,” Gillespie said. “While zero homicides is absolutely worth celebrating, we are committed to keeping this momentum going in 2026 and beyond.”",

    "description": "Ultrawealthy tech investors like David Sacks and Peter Thiel are weighing their options ahead of California's proposed billionaire wealth tax.",
    "fullText": "Is Miami destined to be the new Wall Street, and Austin the next Silicon Valley? \"All-in\" podcaster and White House AI czar David Sacks thinks so.\n\nSacks kicked off a New Year's social media debate by declaring that Miami will overtake New York as the nation's financial capital — and that Austin is poised to replace San Francisco as the center of tech.\n\n\"As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital,\" Sacks wrote in a January 1 post on X that ricocheted through tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from defenders of the old hubs.\n\nLinda Yaccarino, the former CEO of X, responded to Sacks with the word \"Miami\" along with a fire emoji.\n\nGarry Tan, who runs Y Combinator, the influential startup accelerator behind Airbnb, Stripe, and Dropbox, weighed in, saying the firm hasn't expanded beyond San Francisco because founders are still much more likely to build successful, product-market-fit unicorns in the region.\n\nWe haven’t done it yet because it is much more likely that people create successful PMF unicorns staying in SF Bay Area at a rate of 2.5x more\n\nNYC is about 2x\n\nTan recently said he would consider opening an Austin outpost if California moves forward with a proposed billionaire tax. The ballot measure would impose a one-time 5% levy on California residents with assets exceeding $1 billion and could go before voters in November if it qualifies.\n\nSacks urged Tan to reconsider, arguing that a Y Combinator outpost in Austin could become a \"self-fulfilling prophecy.\" \"If YC and others support Austin, it will be successful,\" Sacks said.\n\nMusk replied simply, \"Yes.\" The Pittsburgh-based venture capitalist Brandon Brooks said an Austin outpost \"would be the biggest shift for the startup ecosystem in history.\"\n\nSacks is a venture capitalist, podcaster, and one of the earliest members of the so-called \"PayPal mafia,\" a group of PayPal employees who went on to positions of influence and power in Silicon Valley. His profile surged after he was appointed the Trump administration's artificial intelligence and crypto czar.\n\nSacks' own firm is already on the move. Craft Ventures said it opened an Austin office in December, with Sacks relocating to the city while the firm maintains offices in New York and San Francisco. Fellow Texans including Elon Musk, Michael Dell, and Joe Lonsdale, one of the cofounders of Palantir, welcomed him with posts.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe argument Sacks is making isn't new (one online poster on X even replied with a popular \"Grand Theft Auto\" video game meme showing the character saying \"here we go again.\")\n\nThe debate flared during the pandemic, when remote work drove waves of coastal workers to Texas and Florida in search of more space, lower taxes, and a cheaper cost of living. Austin, in particular, ascended as companies like Tesla and Oracle moved into the region, and giants like Google and Facebook expanded their office footprints.\n\nSacks has also been making the case that high taxes, heavy regulation, and a leftward political turn are driving talent and capital out of legacy power centers like San Francisco and New York.\n\nSacks posted his prediction the same day Zohran Mamdani was inaugurated as New York City's mayor, making history as the first socialist mayor to hold the office.\n\nLonsdale's venture firm, 8VC, moved from San Francisco to Austin in 2020. Lonsdale tweeted at the time that the firm was moving for several reasons, among them: \"Austin is far more tolerant of ideological diversity than SF.\"\n\nThe hype hasn't fully held. Some tech workers told Business Insider they later left or tried to leave Austin, citing brutal heat, traffic, overcrowding, and a tech scene that felt thinner than advertised.\n\nMeanwhile, Thiel Capital is expanding in Miami as California's proposed wealth tax looms.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thiel Capital, the private investment firm founded by the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel said it has opened a new office in Miami.\n\nIf the proposal passes, the tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

A spokesperson for the fire department confirmed to Page Six that paramedics received a call at 2:52 a.m. for a medical emergency.\n\n“Bystanders were given instructions for CPR according to CAD records,” the spokesperson said.\n\nTMZ, citing Broadcastify dispatch audio, reports that the call came in as a “code 3 for the overdose, color change.”\n\nVictoria was found on the 14th floor by a hotel guest who believed the former actress had passed out on the ground from drinking and alerted hotel staff, a source claimed to the Daily Mail. The source claimed there were no signs of foul play and no drug paraphernalia found at the scene.\n\nHotel staff performed CPR and called for an ambulance, but paramedics confirmed the 34-year-old was unresponsive and pronounced dead on the scene. A cause of death had not been determined as of Friday morning.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department is now handling the death investigation and a medical examiner is expected to determine her cause of death.\n\nVictoria was the daughter of Tommy, 79, and his second wife, Kimberlea Cloughley. The actor and director is known for starring in films including No Country for Old Men, Men In Black and The Fugitive.\n\nVictoria followed in her father’s footsteps at a young age, appearing in Men In Black II. She also appeared in an episode of One Tree Hill in 2003, and had a role in the 2005 film The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, which was directed by Tommy.\n\nVictoria is survived by one brother, Austin Jones, born to both Tommy and Cloughley. The former couple were married for 15 years, from 1981 to 1996.\n\nVictoria had reportedly stepped back from the spotlight in recent years. New reports claim she had been arrested at least three times in the last year. In April, Jones’ daughter was arrested in Napa County, California, for obstructing a peace officer, being under the influence of a controlled substance, and possession of a narcotic controlled substance, The New York Post reported, citing court documents.\n\nVictoria was also arrested in Santa Cruz County and again in Napa County in June 2025 on domestic battery and domestic violence/elder abuse charges. She pleaded not guilty in both Napa County cases, court records showed, according to the report.\n\nWNBA Star Angel Reese Smolders in Skintight Black Minidress and Fur in Sultry Selfies\n\nFormer Pro Surfer Sterre Meijer Poses in Button-Down Shirt, Thigh-High Boots and Nothing Else For Mirror Selfie\n\nWWE Star Tiffany Stratton Shows Off Ripped Body in Athletic Bra and Skintight Leggings\n\nThis story New Details Emerge After Tommy Lee Jones’ Daughter Was Found Dead in San Francisco on New Year’s Day first appeared on National Enquirer.

    "fullText": "The Sussexes’ PR problems are back in the spotlight as 2025 draws to a close. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have faced steady blowback around launches and messaging. Now, a fresh staffing shake-up is raising questions about their public image team.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess have built a California-based brand across media and charity work. However, insiders now describe their communications operation as hard to run. Consequently, the search for the right publicist is reportedly becoming more difficult.\n\nAs per Rob Shuter’s Substack report dated December 31, 2025, a senior U.S. publicist resigned. It says Meredith Maines quit after about 10 months in the role. A former staffer said, “The job isn’t hard because of the press,” adding, “It’s hard because of the principals.” The person claimed, “Harry and Meghan are impossible to satisfy.” They also alleged that their “expectations constantly shift.”\n\nMeanwhile, another insider said in the report that top American PR firms are declining the account. The person claimed, “They’re difficult and, frankly, cheap.” The source argued that budgets are a sticking point for Sussex‘s PR strategy. The person said, “Kardashians and Beyoncé spend a fortune on PR.” However, they claimed the couple expects the same results “for a fraction of the budget.”\n\nWith U.S. options narrowing, the report says London strategist Liam Maguire may step up. An insider said they are “cutting costs by eliminating a senior American salary.” Still, the person warned that running a U.S. operation from London brings “huge challenges.” They pointed to time zone strain and “burnout risks.”\n\nIn the Substack report, staffers also described the workplace mood as intense. One source said, “The office is high pressure, constantly shifting.” They added that it can hit “DEFCON 1 over minor issues.” Another insider said, “A competent PR can survive bad headlines.” However, they added, “They can’t survive clients who won’t listen.”\n\nFor now, the claims keep Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s PR issues in a familiar loop. If staffing stabilizes, messaging may settle, too. If it does not, the churn could stay part of the story in 2026.\n\nThe post Royal Couple ‘Impossible To Satisfy’ Amid PR Nightmare — Source appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "Rain poured down on the iconic Rose Parade on Thursday for the first time in 20 years, as flood warnings and evacuation orders in Southern California joined snow squalls and frigid temperatures in the country's midsection to mark the first day of 2026.\n\nMarching bands, floats and throngs of spectators were soaked by one to two inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) of New Year’s Day rain at the 137th Rose Parade in Pasadena. The mercury stood at a chilly 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14.4 degrees Celsius) at the 8 a.m. start of the parade.\n\nAcross the country, in New York City, hats and gloves were as necessary as noisemakers at the city's New Year's Eve ball drop, where temperatures near freezing appeared to be the coldest in 10 years.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people gather along the nearly six-mile (10-kilometer) route in Pasadena, where the two-hour parade kicked off. Millions more watch on national television. Organizers at the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, the group that organizes the parade ahead of the Rose Bowl college football game, said they made only small changes to accommodate the weather, such as the tops being up on convertibles carrying grand marshal Earvin “Magic” Johnson and other VIPs.\n\nRain forecasts for the Rose Parade, which had been dry for 20 years, grew all week. On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for all California counties and a coastal flood advisory through Sunday afternoon along much of the Pacific Coast near San Francisco.\n\nMeanwhile, residents in the areas hit hardest by last year's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires were under evacuation warnings.\n\nIn New York City, the sun came out ahead of Mayor Zohran Mamdani's inaugural celebration, but other areas of the Northeast and Midwest were hit by an Alberta clipper storm and trailing Arctic front that brought snow squalls and high winds.\n\nConditions varied widely — from snow showers to heavier squalls — from Wisconsin through northern Illinois and Michigan and into northern New Jersey, southeastern New York and New England.\n\nAbout a quarter of flights were delayed out of both San Diego International Airport and Boston Logan, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.",

    "description": "California's DMV said some legal immigrants had been issued Real IDs that did not expire at the same time as their authorization to remain in the country.",
    "fullText": "The California Department of Motor Vehicles said this week that approximately 325,000 Californians will be required to replace their Real ID licenses because of a software error.\n\nIn the coming weeks, DMV officials said, about 1.5% of those holding Real IDs will be notified that they “need to take action” to “ensure continued compliance with federal REAL ID regulations.”\n\n“The DMV is informing affected individuals of the steps they need to take,” officials said in a news release issued Wednesday. Fees associated with reissuing the IDS will be waived for those affected.\n\nDMV officials said the problem was discovered after a review of technology systems revealed that some legal immigrants had been issued Real IDs that did not expire at the same time as their authorization to remain in the country.\n\nThe Real ID Act was signed into law in 2005 and established security standards for state-issued IDs for things like boarding planes. But implementation was repeatedly delayed, and the requirement finally went into effect in May of 2025. DMV officials said they discovered that a “small subset” of Real IDs issued to lawful permanent residents “applied the standard credential renewal interval in some cases, instead of the expiration of a REAL ID holder’s authorized stay.”\n\n“We proactively reviewed our records, identified a legacy system issue from 2006, and are notifying impacted customers with clear guidance on how to maintain a valid California-issued credential,” DMV Director Steve Gordon said. “For nearly 99% of REAL ID holders, no action is required. The DMV remains committed to serving all Californians and ensuring REAL ID credentials meet federal standards.”\n\nOfficials said the problem came about because of “legacy coding from 2006.” But the release added that all those who had been issued Real IDs received them only after the federal system had verified their lawful presence in the country, and that no one who was undocumented got one.\n\nA.

    "description": "Thiel Capital, founded by, billionaire Peter Thiel, said it opened a new office in Miami.",
    "fullText": "Thiel Capital is expanding in Miami.\n\nOn Wednesday, the private investment firm founded by the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel said it has opened a new office in Miami.\n\nThiel Capital's press release said that the new office is located in Wynwood, a former warehouse district that has become a hub for startups, investors, and cultural institutions. The lease was signed in December, and the new office will \"complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles,\" the firm said.\n\nThe announcement comes as a proposal for a wealth tax was floated in California.\n\nMiami's startup and finance scene heated up during the pandemic and in the years that followed, with many big firms from California and New York relocating their headquarters and expanding their offices there.\n\nSan Francisco-based Founders Fund, the venture capital firm cofounded by Thiel, has had an office in Miami since 2021. In 2020, Thiel bought an $18 million house in Miami's Venetian Islands.\n\nCalifornia is debating a proposed wealth tax that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents with net worths exceeding $1 billion, to be paid over five years.\n\nThe wealth tax still needs 870,000 signatures to even make it to the ballot in November 2026, where it would then be approved or rejected by voters at the ballot box. However, billionaires have already been critical of the plan and warned of an exodus of the wealthy.\n\nIt was proposed by SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West and designed to offset anticipated cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance.\n\nIn comparison to an income tax, a wealth tax is a levy on all of an individual's net worth, because it is difficult to quantify the annual income of a person who doesn't earn normal paychecks but has other assets that gain value every year. The tax would apply to the roughly 200 billionaires residing in California, which has a total population of over 39 million people. The SEIU-UHW estimates that the one-time tax will bring in $100 billion over five years for the state.\n\nCelebrity attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of his clients, warning that his clients will \"permanently relocate\" if the California wealth tax passes.\n\nIzzy Gardon, a spokesperson for Newsom's office, told Business Insider that the governor has \"consistently opposed state-level wealth taxes\" and that a wealth tax, \"if implemented at a state-only level, they drive a race to the bottom.\"\n\nIf passed, the wealth tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Put your hands down, class, I know what your question is.\n\nHas a Louisville team ever before been whistled for 16 fouls in a half?\n\nWhich U of L was in the opening twenty at venerable Haas Pavilion.\n\nMy definitive answer after checking the media guide is a definitive probably not.\n\nOn December 10, 1953, the Cards were flagged for 43 total in a 71-78 L at Siena.\n\nOK, it is for sure. The laws of mathematics dictate they must have had more than that in one, probably both halves.\n\nThe Cards, despite being -12 at the line in the 1st, led by 14 at the break, 48-34.\n\nThanks to coming out scorching, draining their first five shots, three Sananda Fru deuces, and a pair of triples, one by Ryan Conwell, the other by Isaac McKneely.\n\nCal never pulled closer than 7, and the Cardinals never led by less than double digits after the 12:10 mark of the opening stanza.\n\nOK, here’s my question: WTF was Vangelis Zougris doing in the game just past midway through the 2d?\n\nDuring his three minute stint, the Golden Bears went on a 9-0 thrust.\n\nVZ was technically only -9 (the only negative +/- for a Cardinal). But technically he was really -14. But Pat Kelsey wisely benched him after he committed one of the stupidest deadball Ts I’ve ever witnessed. Which resulted in five more California tallies, two FTs and a trey.\n\nThe bracing 14 point run cut the margin to 73-62 with 6:27 left.\n\nThen  U of L’s maturity reigned.\n\nAdrian Wooley scored a second chance deuce, then followed it with a triple.\n\nThe seven point skein steadied the situation.\n\nU of L — playing shorthanded without Mikel Brown or Kasean Pryor — kept Cal’s measure the rest of the way.\n\nIt was simply one of the oddest twenty point victories I can recall.\n\nMidway through the 2d, the Cardinals led 68-43 and were teetering. Ryan Conwell had just been called for his fourth foul. Woeful marksmanship after intermission to that point. 7/19. 2/10. But the Bears, perhaps the most mediocre 12-1 squad in memory, were more inept. 5/19. 1/9. For the half, U of L was actually +4 at the line at that moment.\n\nSoon thereafter came the Zougrisian Abominata.\n\nSteadiness and that much appreciated level headedness prevailed.\n\nLouisville only committed 9 infractions in the 2d, one less than the home team.\n\nFor the tilt, the Cards were +19 off the glass, +20 in the paint.\n\nThough Conwell led Louisville in scoring with 26, for my money, it was the Hadley glue and the Wooley bully — couldn’t help myself — that were most key.\n\nJH had 11 with 9 boards and 3 assists. AW had 21, many were important answers and thrust stoppers.\n\nSanny Fru was also boffo. He fashioned his first double double with 13 and 14.\n\nKobe Rodgers was a steady, calming presence. As usual. Khani Rooths was strong in his 18 minutes. And McKneely remains way more an all around positive than most expected.\n\nOvercoming a cross country trip, significant foul trouble, the absence of two key ballers, in your conference opener on the road for a 20 point W is not to be sneezed at.\n\nNext: a trip down to Silicon Valley for a date with Stanford Friday night in Palo Alto.",

    "description": "Bill Ackman, Palmer Luckey, Garry Tan, and more are sharing their opinions on a California billionaire tax proposal.",
    "fullText": "Some of the biggest names in business are speaking up about California's billionaire tax proposal.\n\nThe measure proposed a one-time 5% tax for California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion. If the proposal receives enough signatures, it would appear on the state ballot in November.\n\nIf the proposal passes, the tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nProposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union, the bill attempts to fill a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nCalifornia is home to some of the biggest companies — in both value and prestige — in the US. The state boasts Hollywood and Silicon Valley, although some of the industries' key players have relocated.\n\nIn a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom obtained by Business Insider, attorney Alex Spiro wrote that his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the tax becomes law. Spiro has previously represented billionaires and celebrities.\n\nHere's how several business leaders and politicians have reacted to the tax proposal:\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Holdings wrote Monday on X that he was \"opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property,\" which can have \"unintended and negative consequences.\"\n\nHowever, he said he's in favor of a \"fairer tax system.\"\n\nFor example, Ackman wrote that an individual who had amassed a billion dollars or \n\n\"One shouldn't be able to live and spend like a billionaire and pay no tax,\" Ackman wrote.\n\nAs for California's \"budget problems,\" Ackman wrote that the issue wasn't a lack of tax revenue — it was about \"how the money is being spent.\"\n\nThe White House AI and crypto czar took aim at California's government in an X post on Sunday.\n\nRed states like Texas and Florida don't employ state income taxes, let alone wealth taxes, Sacks wrote. \"Democrats steal everything, then blame job creators for their 'greed,'\" he wrote.\n\nSacks said in an October episode of the \"All-In\" podcast, which he cohosts, that a wealth tax \"always backfires,\" because tax benefits are outweighed by wealthy residents leaving.\n\nSacks threatened to leave the state, analogizing steady tax increases to boiling a frog on the podcast.\n\n\"I'm going to have to jump out of the pot with this,\" he said.\n\nThe Congressman for California's 17th district, which covers much of Silicon Valley, said that the proposal was \"good for American innovation.\"\n\nAfter receiving thousands of comments on a Friday post bidding a sarcastic goodbye to those threatening to leave the state, Khanna explained his support in a seven-paragraph X post on Saturday.\n\nHe wrote that Nvidia would be built all over again, even with the wealth tax.\n\n\"Jensen [Huang] wasn't thinking I won't start this company because I may have to one day pay a 1% tax on my billions,\" Khanna wrote. \"He built here because the talent is here.\"\n\nKhanna argued that innovation would be further stifled by the \"political dysfunction and social unrest\" that comes with wide wealth gaps.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, wrote that the representative has \"always supported a modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have healthcare.\"\n\n\"He has advocated for common sense workarounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock,\" Drory wrote.\n\nThe Oculus founder and Anduril cofounder wrote in a Sunday X post that the tax would force founders to \"sell huge chunks of our companies.\"\n\nLuckey wrote that he made money from Oculus — which he sold to Facebook in 2014 — and paid millions in taxes on it. Then he used the \"remainder\" to start Anduril, he wrote.\n\n\"Now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash,\" Luckey wrote.\n\nLuckey also wrote that the policy made no provision for companies that funnel revenue back to research and development, rather than paying cash incomes sizable enough to cover the tax.\n\n\"You are effectively forcing companies to immediately pivot into profit obsession over mission or long-term sustainability,\" he wrote.\n\nThe CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator wrote in a Saturday X post that the tax would \"kill little tech in California.\"\n\nUnicorn startup founders become a \"paper billionaire\" — as in, having cash on hand — around the $5 billion valuation point, Tan wrote.\n\nThe proposed tax is on unrealized gains, meaning founders would be put on the line even before their wealth is liquid, Tan wrote.\n\nIf the tax passed, Tan wrote that Y Combinator would consider opening Austin or Cambridge programs.\n\nThe Vermont senator has long been a proponent of taxes on the wealthy, introducing a bill in 2019 that aimed to halve the wealth of billionaires over a 15-year period.\n\nWhile Sanders didn't explicitly comment on the California proposal, he posted Monday on X broadly supporting wealth taxes.\n\n\"We can respect innovation & entrepreneurship, but we cannot respect the extraordinary greed that now exists,\" Sanders wrote. \"We need a wealth tax.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO reposted another user's X post that commented on the tax, saying that his stocks weren't wealth.\n\nMusk wrote in his Tuesday post that his \"wealth\" was mostly tied up in Tesla and SpaceX shares.\n\n\"This means my 'wealth' can only increase due to producing more products and services for the public,\" he wrote.\n\nWhile not directly commenting on the California tax, Musk wrote that he was a \"maker,\" unlike \"taker\" politicians like Sanders.\n\nMusk said in 2020 that he had moved from California to Texas.\n\nThe governor of California has spoken against the wealth tax. At The New York Times' Dealbook conference in December, Newsom said that California had to stay competitive with other states.\n\n\"People of that status, they already have two or three homes outside the state,\" he said. \"You've got to be pragmatic about it.\"\n\nIf the tax passes as a ballot measure, Newsom would not have the ability to veto it.",

    "fullText": "HOLBROOK, Ariz. (AP) — Investigators declined to reveal the suspected motive in the shooting death of a prominent California farmer’s estranged wife in eastern Arizona, but they said the couple's prolonged divorce case arose in nearly all interviews with family and friends.\n\nMichael Abatti, 63, was arrested last week in El Centro, California, in the shooting death of Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, at her family’s vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband.\n\nInvestigators, who discussed the case at a news conference Monday, say Michael Abatti traveled from El Centro to Pinetop on Nov. 20, carried out the killing and returned to California early the next morning. They declined to say what occurred at the Pinetop house in the last days of Kerri Abatti’s life.\n\n“Different theories will come up,” Navajo County Sheriff David Clouse said of the motive. “The only thing that’s glaring that I think everybody already knows is there’s a divorce in place and they weren’t able to come to a resolution. But I can’t speak exactly to what the motive would be.”\n\nOwen Roth, one of Michael Abatti’s attorneys, said his client surrendered to law enforcement, agreed to be extradited to Arizona and remains innocent under the law. “Our client is in his mid-60s and has significant health issues, and we continue to worry about his well-being,” Roth said. “We ask the public to respect his privacy and constitutional rights and reiterate that this case will be decided based on the evidence by a jury.” An autopsy report released Monday said Kerri Abatti’s cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nThe report said she was found unconscious on the floor near her kitchen by her nephew, who told investigators he heard a loud sound before finding her. When investigators searched the home they found a “circular defect” on a window and determined “a gunshot likely originated from the yard outside the home,” the autopsy report said.\n\nThe Associated Press left a message for the Navajo County Sheriff’s Office for further explanation. The medical examiner’s office in Coconino County, which conducted the autopsy, directed questions about the report to a Navajo County official, and the AP also left a message for the official. A descendant of early Latter-day Saints settlers who helped found Pinetop in the 1880s, Kerri had filed for divorce, with proceedings pending in California at the time of her death.\n\nAuthorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife’s death.\n\nMichael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops. His grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region’s early settlers and his father helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association.\n\nMichael Abatti served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.\n\nThe Abattis, who married in 1992 and had three children, were sparring over finances. Kerri told the court the couple had lived an affluent lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned property in three states, vacationed internationally and sent their children to private school.\n\nKerri initially received $5,000 monthly temporary spousal support. She later sought an increase, citing struggles to maintain her standard of living as well as keep up the Arizona property. She also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney’s fees, court filings showed.\n\nMichael Abatti eventually agreed to raise support to $6,400 monthly, despite having countered in a court filing that poor farming years had reduced his income. He blamed market shifts favoring Ukrainian crops, rising shipping costs and harsh weather.",
