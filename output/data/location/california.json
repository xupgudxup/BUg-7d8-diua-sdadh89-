    "description": "Tesla engaged in false advertising for its Full Self-Driving system. Unless it fixes the issues, its license to sell in CA will be suspended.",
    "fullText": "A California judge ruled late Tuesday afternoon that Tesla engaged in “deceptive marketing” in reference to its Full Self-Driving system, and that Tesla’s license to sell and produce cars in the state should be revoked for 30 days.\n\nHowever, the California DMV has said it will give Tesla 60 days to comply and fix its marketing before going through with the suspension.\n\nThe ruling is big news in a case that has been ongoing for years now.\n\nTesla has been selling level 2 driver assist software since 2016 which it calls “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), despite that this software did not (and still does not) make its cars capable of driving themselves.\n\nThis name has attracted much consternation over the years, becoming more absurd as each of Tesla’s predicted deadlines for the advent of full autonomy blow by.\n\nTesla also provides software under the name “Autopilot,” another term that evokes some level of autonomy, though perhaps not as explicitly as the aforementioned FSD. Tesla long held the position that this word is meant to evoke airplane-like systems that still require a pilot, but can just do most of the work for them.\n\nSo eventually, in 2021, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) officially started an investigation into Tesla’s marketing claims, to determine whether the company had lied to consumers.\n\nCalifornia found that the company was saying different things to the public than it was saying to the DMV.\n\nThe DMV then sent an official inquiry to Tesla in 2022, asking for it to respond to the claim that it was creating incorrect perceptions about the capabilities of its system. Tesla’s response stated that it had been allowed to lie about FSD for so long that it should get to keep going, which was apparently not persuasive enough to the courts, and the case was then slated for trial.\n\nDuring this time, the California legislature got involved as well, passing a law that specifically banned automakers from deceiving consumers into thinking vehicles have more autonomous capabilities than they do.\n\nWell, after all these investigations and waiting, we finally have an an answer, and the judge’s ruling makes it quite clear: Tesla lied to consumers about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nThe court looked at Tesla’s marketing claims and also at surveys of people exposed to those claims and their opinion of whether a Tesla would be able to drive itself, given the marketing messages put out by the company.\n\nIt found problems both with the word Autopilot and the phrase Full Self-Driving.\n\nThe word “Autopilot” was not found to be “unambiguously false,” but the court said that its use “follows a long but unlawful tradition of ‘intentionally (using) ambiguity to mislead consumers while maintaining some level of deniability about the intended meaning.'” The court found that a reasonable person could believe that a car on Autopilot doesn’t require their constant undivided attention, which is incorrect as the driver is still fully responsible for the vehicle.\n\nOn “Full Self-Driving,” the court was even more harsh. It found that this feature name is “actually, unambiguously false and counterfactual” (comically, Tesla tried to argue here that “no reasonable person” could believe that Full Self-Driving actually means Full Self-Driving).\n\nThe court noted other language used by Tesla, including marketing copy that said “the system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat,” and suggested that “legal reasons” are the only things holding Tesla back from full autonomy. Tesla tried to say that this was a statement of future intent, but the court found that its use of the present tense shows otherwise.\n\nTesla has repeatedly changed its wording around FSD, first calling it Full Self-Driving Capability, then changing that to Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to emphasize the need for a driver to supervise the vehicle. The court noted these changes, and then said it would not be a burden to force Tesla to change its marketing further to clarify that its cars do not drive themselves.\n\nWhich leads us to the proposed legal remedy: the court said that the DMV could suspend or revoke Tesla’s licenses for 30 days, stopping its ability to sell or build cars in the state.\n\nTesla’s first factory is in Fremont, California, where it still builds around half a million vehicles a year and employs some ~20,000 employees. Tesla says this remedy would be “draconian,” but the court said that without this option, there’s no reason to believe Tesla would stop its misrepresentations to the public.\n\nThe court also examined the possibility of financial restitution, but deemed that inappropriate. Since the case did not establish any quantifiable financial harm done by Tesla’s misrepresentation and noted the impracticality of accounting for that harm.\n\nThis ruling does not yet mean that Tesla can’t sell cars in California, which is its largest market in the US by far. The court noted that the DMV has the option of suspension or revocation, which the DMV can do at its discretion. And the DMV has said that it will allow Tesla 60 days to comply with the order before it takes action, and that it would focus on Tesla’s dealer license rather than its manufacturing license.\n\nThis would mean, specifically, that Tesla not refer to a level 2 driving system as “Autopilot” or using language that suggests these vehicles are autonomous. It will have to change its marketing materials and stop making public statements misleading the public about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nTesla said after the ruling that “sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” But we’ll see what happens in 60 days, and what sort of changes Tesla does or does not make to its deceptive marketing.\n\nTuesday’s ruling is just one of many legal cases against Tesla right now, specifically having to do with FSD. One relevant case is a class action lawsuit in California claiming Tesla misled customers about its cars self-driving capabilities. This ruling could provide fuel for that lawsuit, given a California judge has already gone on the record with an official determination that Tesla misled the public about FSD.\n\nThe 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year.

    "description": "Engineer Limhi Somerville joins the California-based company from what may be its largest United Kingdom competitor.",
    "fullText": "California-based electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxi developer Archer Aviation is putting down roots on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company revealed its plans to build an engineering hub in South West England that will be operated by a new subsidiary, Archer Aviation UK Limited. The move adds to its primary manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia, which could also be complemented by production capabilities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\n\"The U.K. has the talent and industrial base to be a major player in driving the next era of advanced aerospace and defence,\" said Adam Goldstein, Archer's founder and CEO. \"Archer's plans to open a U.K. engineering hub underscores our commitment to being an integral part of the next-generation of aerospace and defence in the country.\"\n\nArcher also poached engineer Limhi Somerville from what would be its largest U.K. competitor-Vertical Aerospace, which last week unveiled its flagship eVTOL, Valo.\n\nLike Archer's Midnight, Valo is designed to carry up to four passengers on zero-emission flights in urban settings, producing a fraction of the noise of a helicopter. Somerville spent six years with Vertical and led its development of electric batteries and powertrains, most recently serving as director of engineering. He will join Archer's team in early 2026, the company said.\n\nAcquiring team members from competitors is a blueprint the company has deployed before. Earlier this year, for example, George Kivork, the former head of U.S. state and local policy for rival Joby Aviation, joined Archer as a general manager for the Los Angeles region.\n\nHowever, the strategy has gotten the company in some hot water. Joby in November sued both Archer and Kivork, alleging that its competitor used trade secrets from Kivork to undercut an exclusive deal it had planned to finalize. Archer has rejected the allegations.\n\nWisk Aero, the eVTOL arm of Boeing, sued Archer in 2021, also alleging that a former employee stole trade secrets. Archer promptly countersued. The companies ultimately settled for an undisclosed amount, and Boeing made an investment intended to fund the integration of Wisk's autonomy technology on future variants of Midnight.\n\nMidnight is a piloted, four-passenger eVTOL model with a cruise speed of about 150 mph, designed for 10-20-minute, 20-50 sm trips. Its six electric battery packs each power a pair of motors and propellers, half of which are capable of tilting to support both hover and forward flight.\n\nIn the U.S., Archer is working with United Airlines-which placed an order for up to 200 aircraft-and Southwest Airlines to build air taxi networks in major urban centers. It has shared potential route maps for New York, Miami, and Los Angeles, where it recently acquired Hawthorne Municipal Airport (KHHR) for $126 million.",

    "fullText": "To prevent the spread of a serious bacterial disease that infects citrus crops, United States officials are expanding two federal quarantine areas.\n\nAs reported by the Fresh Fruit Portal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has expanded the citrus greening quarantines for two separate counties in Southern California.\n\nAPHIS is expanding the quarantined area in the Capistrano Beach area of Orange County by 29 square miles and the Murrieta area of Riverside County by 129 square miles. The announcement of the expansion follows the positive detection of citrus greening in plant tissue samples collected from locations in both Orange and Riverside Counties.\n\nAccording to APHIS, there are currently no commercial citrus trees impacted by the expansion of the quarantined area in Orange County. However, 170 acres of commercial citrus trees have now been impacted by the citrus greening quarantine in Riverside County.\n\nThe quarantine expansions are coordinated with the California Department of Food and Agriculture. They aim to contain citrus greening by restricting the movement of citrus materials within the state, aligning with 7 CFR 301.76.\n\n\"This action is necessary to prevent the spread of citrus greening to non-infested areas of the United States,\" APHIS wrote in the release.\n\nThe bacterial disease is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid, an invasive insect species that was first documented in the U.S. in 1998. These invasive pests can wreak havoc on local ecosystems and economies by disrupting agricultural industries and interfering with native species.\n\nCitrus greening, in particular, can be devastating for citrus crops. It can lead to reduced yields, poor-quality fruit, and higher production costs. The bacteria can block nutrient flow in plants, stunting growth and killing roots. As noted by APHIS, there is currently no known cure for the disease.\n\nThis isn't the first time in 2025 that California has turned to drastic measures to deal with invasive insects. In September, portions of Santa Clara County were placed under quarantine by the California Department of Food and Agriculture after officials detected the invasive Mediterranean fruit fly.\n\n\"A quarantine is a way to minimize damage and stop the risk of spread by restricting the movement of fruits and vegetables,\" wrote the CDFA in a press release.\n\nDo you think fracking should be illegal in America?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The judge ruled Tesla should have to suspend manufacturing and sales in California for 30 days, but the DMV stayed those rulings for 90 days to allow Tesla to comply.",
    "fullText": "An administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\n\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.”\n\n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\n\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\n\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\n\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\n\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.",

    "description": "California's DMV ordered Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" within 90 days, or face a month-long dealership suspension.",
    "fullText": "Tesla may have to rebrand Autopilot.\n\nSteve Gordon, the Director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a media briefing on Tuesday that Tesla has 90 days to amend its advertising language or face a 30-day suspension from selling in California.\n\nGordon said on Tuesday that the DMV is specifically asking Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" to clarify that the company has advanced driving systems, which do not equate to an automated system or an autonomous vehicle. Changes must be made within 90 days, or the DMV will \"enforce the cessation of sales.\"\n\n\"My guess is that they will pursue some remedy,\" said Gordon of what Tesla might do next, \"but the easiest one for them is just to come into compliance.\"\n\nIn response to the DMV's decision, a Tesla spokesperson told Business Insider that this is \"a 'consumer protection' order about the use of the term 'Autopilot' in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nOn November 21, Administrative Judge Juliet E. Cox made a proposed decision about whether Tesla has misled consumers into thinking its cars are more capable of driving themselves than they actually are, and transmitted it to the DMV for consideration. The document containing the proposal, however, has been withheld from the public and won't be released till December 22.\n\nGordon said during the Tuesday briefing that Cox recommended both a suspension of Tesla's license to sell and to manufacture in California. The DMV, however, decided not to pursue a suspension of the license to manufacture and put a temporary 90-day stay on the suspension of the license to sell for Tesla to make amends.\n\n\"They're very important to the state,\" said Gordon of Tesla. \"We want to be fair to them and give them a chance to see if they can find a resolution now that there is a ruling from the administrative law judge.\"\n\n\"If you look at the Q3 report of this year, Tesla has the top-selling car, the Model Y, in its segment,\" Gordon added. \"We felt that the leverage via the sales channel was sufficient to get compliance.\"\n\nThe notice to Tesla follows a weeklong hearing in July at the administrative court in Oakland. In 2022, the DMV sued Tesla, accusing the carmaker of misleading consumers through Tesla's advertisements and by naming its driver assistance technologies \"Full Self-Driving\" and \"Autopilot.\"\n\nTesla, which had a rocky year, denied that the company had ever tried to conceal the fact that its vehicles cannot fully drive themselves.\n\nThe DMV sought to suspend Tesla's ability to sell cars in the state for at least 30 days and award consumers monetary damages.\n\nThe CA DMV wrote in its complaint that on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, Tesla's website advertised its FSD driver assistance system as being \"designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver's seat.\"\n\nTesla's lawyers said during the hearing that the company has always informed buyers that they \"cannot fully rely\" on FSD or Autopilot.\n\n\"Cars with Full Self-Driving capabilities are currently not capable of driving themselves,\" said Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, during the hearing.",

While Hank slipped out in the ensuing chaos and headed to New Vegas, Lucy decided to join Cooper in his quest for answers, which led them into unknown and dangerous territory.\n\nThe first episode of Fallout Season 2, \"The Man Who Knew,\" opens with a brief Pre-War flashback that shows the public protesting against RobCo industries. The scene then takes us inside a bar where a mysterious stranger (Justin Theroux) manages to taunt a group of unemployed workers about how RobCo industries founder Mr. House is more powerful than the government. They then follow him outside, where he attaches a device to the back of one of their heads in return for millions of dollars. Using this device, he’s able to command the man to attack his friends with a baseball bat, but when the mind-controlled man begins to turn against the mysterious stranger, the device makes his head explode in gory fashion.\n\nJumping back to the present, we see that Cooper is captured in Novac by the Great Khans, one of the factions running rampant in the Mojave Wasteland. But when they’re about to execute him, Lucy reveals herself in an iconic sniper perch from Fallout: New Vegas and exposes their plan to rob the Khans of their bottlecaps. She fails a dialogue check and chaos ensues; Cooper is forced to intervene in bloody fashion, reminding audiences once again why he’s one of the best gunslingers in the Wasteland.\n\nIt’s not long after this fight that Cooper reveals that New Vegas survived The Great War, thanks to a missile system designed by Mr. House, which shot the bombs out of the sky. This includes a brief pre-war flashback in which Cooper learns of Vault-Tec and House’s plans for The Great War. He struggles to get his daughter to safety.\n\nChecking in on the residents of Vault 33 in the present, we find Overseer Pearson (Leslie Uggams), who mentions that the vault's water purification chip is broken. Meanwhile, in Vault 32, Stephanie Harper (Annabel O’Hagan) is adjusting to her new life as Overseer and dealing with the needs of her residents and new arrivals from Vault 33. By her side, with child in hand, is Chet (Dave Register), Lucy’s cousin, who is struggling to adjust to his new role as the stepfather of Stephanie’s baby, and dismayed at the mere suggestion that the child be named “Chet Jr.”\n\nFinally, we cut to Vault 31, where Norm (Moises Arias), Lucy’s brother, is held captive by the robo-brain of Bud Askins, a junior vice president of Vault-Tec Industries, after discovering the vault is secretly housing the Vault-Tec executives from before The Great War.\n\nLucy and Cooper continue to follow the trail of dead bodies left in Hank’s wake. They come across a Starlight Drive-In that’s secretly housing Vault 24. Upon further inspection, they find the vault door has been opened and the inside is covered with overgrown vegetation.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper head inside, we get a Pre-War flashback of Cooper reporting his Vault-Tec findings to Lee Moldaver (Sarita Choudhury), who led the NCR during the battle of Griffith Observatory. Moldaver reveals to Cooper that his wife plans to sell Cold Fusion, an infinite power source, to Mr. House. That and his anti-bomb missile system will make him one of the most powerful men in the world once the bombs drop. Knowing this can’t happen, she asks Cooper to assassinate Mr. House--an event we know now never comes to be).\n\nBack in Vault 31, Norm is growing weaker and weaker from a lack of food and water. Bud offers him salvation in the form of going into Hank’s now-empty cryo chamber. With time running out and with few options, Norm decides to make a rash decision and wakes up all the Vault-Tec executives from their slumber. We see the massive number of chambers begin to open up.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper explore Vault 24, they come across numerous communist corpses and find Russian propaganda playing. Lucy realizes the corpses are actually Americans who were being brainwashed to become communists, possibly as a result of one of Vault-Tec's many sick experiments on vault-dwellers. Deeper in the vault, they find a Great Khan with a mind control device similar to the one the mysterious stranger used at the start of the episode. He delivers a message for Lucy straight from her father: “I fix everything. Go home, Sugar Bomb.” Before they can react, his head explodes into gory viscera.\n\nElsewhere, Hank arrives at a secret Vault-Tec facility and changes out of his stolen power armor into something a bit more business appropriate. After enjoying a damn fine cup of coffee, he begins to record a message for an unknown recipient, promising that his work will continue. In a display case is the mysterious stranger’s mind control device with what looks like smaller and smaller upgraded models alongside it, ending the episode.\n\nFallout returns with a bang! While we got answers about the aftermath of the battle for Griffith Observatory, the quest into the Mojave Wasteland provides even more mysteries. What’s Hank truly up to? What will happen to Norm when all of the Vault-Tec executives wake up? Why is New Vegas so important? Who is the mysterious stranger who created the mind control device? We didn’t even get an update on Maximus (Aaron Moten) and the Brotherhood of Steel. So while we rejoined our comrades in this exciting new setting, there’s still plenty more to discover as we dive deeper into Fallout Season 2.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

It’s unclear if “Amazon-type logistics centers” includes Amazon itself, its competitors or other industries.\n\nQuestions also remain about the Louisiana arrest, as officials said that person is linked to a Turtle Island subgroup created by Carroll called the “Order of the Black Lotus” but was “not directly tied” to the Southern California plot.\n\nIt’s possible more arrests are coming, as Essayli said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“As we review that evidence, if we determine there were any other individuals who knew about this or provided any assistance, we will obviously charge them as well,” Essayli said.",

    "fullText": "Southern California is basking in sunshine and unseasonably warm temperatures this week, but forecasters say a holiday twist is on the way.\n\n“We’re still seeing fog for some coastal spots, but inland areas are warming up above average once again,” KTLA weather anchor Kacey Montoya said Monday, noting highs in the low 80s for the Los Angeles Basin. “It’s about 20 degrees above average today, even warmer tomorrow.”\n\nThe National Weather Service said highs will stay in the low 80s through Thursday before cooling into the 70s by the weekend. Air quality remains moderate for most of the region, with a mandatory wood-burning ban in effect through Tuesday for the South Coast Air Basin.\n\nThe NWS long-range forecast shows a Pacific storm could arrive as early as Dec. 22, with snow levels dropping in mountain communities – potentially complicating holiday travel.\n\n“There is a system that is very likely to bring us some widespread precipitation,” Montoya said. “Models don’t agree on when the rain begins or how much.”\n\nBut meteorologists caution that those hoping for a big boost to ski resorts may be disappointed.\n\n“Next week’s stormy pattern does not appear to be a big snowmaker for our area as the upper level trough will pull in moisture from the southwest initially, then a plume from the south joins in on the fun,” the Weather Service said in a bulletin. “Thus temperatures will remain too warm for any significant snow.”",

    "fullText": "For Carson Palmer, the former NFL quarterback and head football coach of the No. 8 Santa Margarita Catholic Eagles, their season officially ended this past Saturday when they defeated No. 17 De La Salle, 47-13, for California’s Open Division state championship.\n\nIn an interview after the win over De La Salle, Palmer stated that he thought his team was playing its best football of the season and wishes his alma mater had one more game left, maybe against a team out of the state of Georgia or another nationally ranked team.\n\n“It’s been an unreal year, from start to finish,” Palmer said to the Los Angeles Times’ Eric Sondheimer. “With the senior class, it has been spectacular. Could not be more proud of these guys, Could not be prouder [of] our coaching staff and support system. This is [an] unbelievable run. We are playing good football. I wish we had a couple more [games] left. Maybe [a] team in Georgia. Maybe somebody else out there.”\n\nThe season might be over for Santa Margarita Catholic, but when Palmer points to his club is playing its best football of the season, he’s got a valid point.\n\nThe Eagles’ recent run of victories includes impressive wins over nationally ranked teams like De La Salle, Corona Centennial, Orange Lutheran, Mater Dei and Sierra Canyon. Palmer mentioning his wishes of his team possibly playing a team out of Georgia or somewhere else possibly points to seeing themselves crowned as a national champion of high school football.\n\nOne would have to wonder what a matchup between Santa Margarita Catholic and a team like Carrollton (Ga.), Buford (Ga.) or St. Frances Academy (Md.), which won the Overtime Nationals championship last week, would’ve been like. All we’re left with is to imagine what that could’ve turned into.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard. This comprehensive resource provides real-time updates and final scores from across the Golden State, ensuring you never miss a moment of the Friday night frenzy.

    "description": "As an EV perk comes to an end, solo drivers must exit the HOV lane or face a fine.",
    "fullText": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nSolo EV drivers using California carpool lanes will face ticketing beginning Monday as the perk disappears.\n\nThough the benefit, courtesy of the California’s Clean Air Vehicle Decal program, technically ended for solo drivers a few months ago, the Department of Motor Vehicles offered a 60-day grace period that ended Monday. Now, solo drivers face fines of up to $490.\n\nWith this, most carpool lanes require vehicles with more than two people.\n\nAs of Aug. 14, more than half a million motorists statewide had an active decal on their vehicle to access carpool lanes. California has an estimated 1,171 carpool lane-miles, with 803 miles in Southern California and 366 miles in Northern California, according to a UC Berkeley study.\n\nWith more than 35 million total registered vehicles in California, that means 1% to 2% of the vehicle fleet will lose access to the carpool lane, said Antonio Bento, professor of public policy and economics at USC.\n\nExperts say the impact for commuters will be minimal with all the solo EV vehicles returning to the general lanes because traffic is already terrible, according to experts.\n\nFederal legislation has allowed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to grant solo drivers in low-emission and energy-efficient cars to use the carpool, or High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV), lane.\n\nThe goal was to promote the adoption of alternative-fuel vehicles and assist in meeting environmental goals that included reducing fuel consumption and pollution caused by congested freeways, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nOver time, states developed incentive programs, choosing which car models to give carpool access to.\n\nCalifornia is one of 13 states that offered this type of incentive program to its residents. Qualified drivers in the Golden State include those who drive fuel cell electric, natural gas or plug-in electric cars.\n\nIn 2015, Congress authorized California’s program through a highway funding bill, but that authorization expired Sept. 30.\n\nIn an effort to extend the decal program, state Assemblymember Greg Wallis (R-Bermuda Dunes) wrote Assembly Bill 2678, which would push the end date to Jan. 1, 2027.\n\nThe bill was signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year.\n\nBut the change never got the required federal approval so the extension was moot.",

Now, it appears the monolith's mystery might have just been solved through a trademark filing.\nRumors that the monolith was erected to tease new Diablo 4 content, Elder Scrolls 6, God of War, or Lords of the Fallen 2 were all shot down by people in the know. While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian.\nA trio of trademark filings were spotted up by MP1st, including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith.",

    "description": "Paul Thomas Anderson's movie \"One Battle After Another\" has a thrilling car-chase scene that was filmed on location in California.",
    "fullText": "\"One Battle After Another\" production designer Florencia Martin was driving near the California-Arizona border with director Paul Thomas Anderson on a location scout when they came across a unique stretch of road.\n\nAfter miles and miles of flat roadway cut through the middle of the desert, the topography was suddenly rocky, and the road's dips became so dramatic that they looked like big concrete waves stretching as far as the eye could see.\n\n\"Paul took out his phone and started recording out the car window,\" Martin told Business Insider.\n\nNo one in the car knew it yet, but they'd just found the thrilling ending to their movie.\n\nAnderson's latest epic, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an ex-revolutionary who is forced back into the cause to save his daughter Willa (Chase Infiniti) from a deranged military officer (Sean Penn), ends with a tense car-chase scene in which the contours of the road play a key role.\n\nThat only happened because of a stroke of luck. The movie's location manager, Michael Glaser, had taken Martin and Anderson on a three-hour drive from Los Angeles to Blythe, California, to scout a spot for the revolutionaries' camp. On the ride back to LA, they took a different route — one that sent them through a stretch of road outside Borrego Springs, California, that locals call \"The Texas Dip\" for the enormity of its drops.\n\nSoon after that trip, Martin received a new version of the script from Anderson in which the car chase scene ended on \"The Texas Dip.\"\n\nThe thrilling sequence, in which Infiniti's Willa outsmarts an assassin using the road's hills and the angle of the sun, wasn't easy to shoot. The team had scouted the location in the winter, but shot the scene in the summer, so they had to adjust their shooting schedule based on the sun's direction on the road at that time of year. And then there was the unforgiving environment.\n\n\"It was 110 degrees, people had heat exhaustion, there was wind, the dirt would get into the camera and jam it,\" said Martin, whose credits include 2022's \"Babylon\" and Anderson's 2021 movie \"Licorice Pizza.\" \"It was the harshest conditions you could imagine.\"\n\nIt was all worth it once Martin saw the car chase sequence for the first time with an audience.\n\n\"People actually gasped when watching it,\" she said. \"What's special about the way Paul works and being in these locations is you feel it on screen, the dirt on Willa's face, feeling the heat come off the road.\"\n\nMartin still can't believe the sequence is being compared to classic car-chase scenes in movie history.\n\n\"The fact that our movie is compared to movies we've watched like \"The French Connection\" and \"Vanishing Point,\" that are iconic, it's a huge honor,\" she said.\n\n\"One Battle After Another\" is now playing in theaters.",

The long-term vision includes running these aircraft on hydrogen rather than traditional jet fuel.\n\nBut despite the early momentum, Airbus has pushed its initial ZEROe 2035 timeline by as much as 10 years.\n\nAirbus has cited challenges surrounding certification complexity, limited global hydrogen infrastructure, and uncertainty around passenger acceptance — especially when some seats could be positioned far from natural light.\n\nStill, the BWB race is far from just an Airbus effort.\n\nAviation startups like Natilus and JetZero are betting that the unconventional BWB shape could help crack the traditional Boeing-Airbus duopoly, with both targeting launches in the early 2030s.\n\nSan Diego-based Natilus is developing a narrowbody version called Horizon to rival the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, promising about 25% lower fuel burn but 40% more cabin space. And it can fit into existing airport infrastructure.\n\nCompany CEO Aleksey Matyushev previously told Business Insider that the industry could face a shortfall of roughly 40,000 narrowbody jets over the next 20 years — a number he said is far more than the two legacy players can realistically supply.\n\nMatyushev added that Horizon's larger cabin footprint could allow for wider seats, dedicated family areas, and other special features that go beyond what today's narrowbody jets offer.\n\nRenderings of Horizon's proposed cabin, released in July, show up to three aisles instead of the traditional one or two. Matyushev confirmed to Business Insider that the jet will have windows throughout.\n\nPassengers in the center seats will still be farther from the windows, but Natilus said it is adding skylights and other lighting strategies to mimic the outside.\n\nMeanwhile, 100 miles north in Long Beach, JetZero is pursuing a widebody version called the \"Z4\" that promises up to 50% lower fuel burn and could replace jets like the Boeing 767 and Airbus A330.\n\nThe plane would have similar advantages to Horizon in terms of airport compatibility and seat layout.\n\nJetZero has already attracted interest from United Airlines. In April, United Airlines Ventures, the division that invests in these innovative aircraft, said it planned to buy up to 200 of JetZero's 250-seat Z4s.\n\nManaging director Andrew Chang previously told Business Insider that the aircraft's expansive interior could be game changer that feels like a \"living room in the sky.\"\n\nJetZero successfully flew a subscale prototype called Pathfinder in 2024.",
