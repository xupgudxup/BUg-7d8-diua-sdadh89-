    "fullText": "Southern California will enjoy one more day of sunny, ideal weather conditions before the next storm arrives, trading sunshine for clouds, cooler temperatures and rain.\n\nMeteorologists expect a Pacific storm system to sweep into the region late Sunday, bringing light to moderate rain across Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Bernardino counties.\n\n“The latest ensemble solutions are converging on at least 1 to 3 inches of rain for the coast and valleys with the first system Monday and 2 to 5 inches in the mountains,” the National Weather Service said. Road ponding and flooding is possible.\n\nLight showers are likely to begin in northwest San Luis Obispo County by Sunday afternoon, spreading into SoCal by the evening. Highs will cool into the 60s across the region.\n\nForecasters say two upper-level low pressure systems will move through region in the first part of the week. The first will produce the highest rainfall totals, with hourly rainfall rates possibly reaching 1 inch. Rain intensity will ease Monday night into Tuesday, though scattered showers will continue.\n\nMeteorologists expect the wettest window to stretch from Sunday night through Monday morning, with showers lingering well into midweek.",

    "fullText": "Southern California will experience a mild, sunny warming trend through Sunday before a series of three cold storm systems arrive starting Monday.\n\nCoasts and valleys will reach the low 70s this weekend; Monday’s storm could drop up to 2 inches of rain in lower elevations and 4 inches in mountains.\n\nMeteorologists are still determining the exact moisture levels of the third potential system expected to hit the region on Thursday.\n\nLOS ANGELES - Southern California is bracing for a significant shift in weather as three powerful storm systems are forecast to end a warm dry spell, bringing heavy precipitation and hazardous conditions through late next week.\n\nA warming trend fueled by light offshore winds will occur from Friday through Sunday, according to the latest NWS forecast.\n\nDuring this window, coastal areas and valleys should see highs in the upper 60s to low 70s, while mountain and inland areas will remain in the 50s and 60s.\n\nThe NWS has identified Sunday as a \"transition day\" before the first and strongest of two storm systems arrives from the northwest.\n\nThis initial wave is expected to deliver the heaviest rainfall on Monday, with 1 to 3 inches forecast for coastal and valley regions and 2 to 5 inches in the mountains.\n\nThe storm will also bring a risk of thunderstorms, strong winds, and high surf. Snow levels will initially sit around 6,500 feet but are expected to tumble as colder air moves in.\n\nA second storm is slated for Tuesday into Wednesday, followed by a third on Thursday.\n\nFriday – Sunday: Mild warming trend with peak temperatures on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nSunday Night: The first storm system reaches the Central Coast.\n\nMonday: Widespread heavy rain and the start of the \"wettest\" period of the week.\n\nTuesday – Wednesday: The second storm arrives; snow levels begin to drop significantly.\n\nThursday: A third system may impact the region, though moisture levels are unconfirmed.\n\nWhile the timing for the first storm is relatively certain, the NWS notes that \"it’s always difficult to time these features 4 or more days out,\" particularly regarding the exact end of the second system.\n\nWhile debris flows are a major concern, the precise locations of the most intense rain rates within burn scars remain difficult to pinpoint until the storm is closer.\n\nSnow levels are expected to undergo a dramatic change as the week progresses.\n\nWhile the snow level will start near 6,000 feet on Monday, it is forecast to fall to between 3,000 and 3,500 feet by Wednesday.\n\nThis could lead to significant snowfall in lower mountain passes and potentially hazardous driving conditions.\n\nClear drainage: Ensure gutters and storm drains are clear of debris to prevent localized flooding.\n\nMonitor burn scars: Residents near recent burn areas should stay alert for weather updates and be prepared to evacuate if debris flow warnings are issued.\n\nAvoid the surf: Stay away from rock jetties and the water, as large breaking waves and dangerous rip currents are expected.\n\nPrep for snow: If traveling through mountain passes Tuesday or Wednesday, carry tire chains and an emergency kit.\n\nThis report is based on information from the National Weather Service.",

    "fullText": "Police shut down DD Café in Garden Grove, Calif. after \"complaints of illegal activity\"\n\nSeventeen people, including the business owners, were arrested on Feb. 5\n\nThe arrests come days after a TikTok user described DD Café as a \"strip club\" in a viral video about the business\n\nPolice shut down a California café reportedly known for its bikini-clad employees after “complaints of illegal activity” and a viral TikTok describing it as a “strip club.”\n\nSeventeen people were arrested at DD Café on Thursday, Feb. 5 following a police investigation into the Garden Grove, Calif. establishment, the Garden Grove Police Department (GGPD) said in a Feb. 5 news release.\n\nThe department’s Special Investigations Unit conducted the investigation into DD Café “following complaints of illegal activity occurring inside the business,” the GGPD said. On Feb. 5, police served a search warrant at the establishment. Gang suppression officers were on the scene, according to the release.\n\nThe GGPD’s Sgt. Nick Jensen told The Orange County Register that police found DD Café employees serving customers while clad in bikinis, as well as in what the newspaper described as “various states of undress.”\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the business was operating as a “bikini cafe.” The Yelp page for the business shows photos of employees in bikinis, and lists it in business categories for “coffee & tea,” “juice bars & smoothies” and “adult entertainment.”\n\nJensen also told The Orange County Register that the business owners were among the 17 people arrested in the Feb. 5 bust.\n\nThe café violated public nudity and alcohol regulations among other Garden Grove municipal codes, the GGPD sergeant said. The business was not permitted to sell alcohol at the location, the newspaper reported, citing authorities.\n\nIn addition to the arrests, DD Café has also been red-tagged, according to police. This means the business is required to cease operations until the various violations are addressed, Jensen told The Orange County Register. The business is currently listed as closed on Google.\n\nThe owners of DD Café could not be reached for comment. A GGPD spokesperson did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.\n\nThe police investigation into and arrests comes after a video describing the Orange County establishment as a “strip club” went viral on TikTok.\n\n“So I went to a strip club today by accident, and I know what you're thinking. ‘By accident?’ No, actually, for real,” user @dosdaygirl, identified by CBS News as Paulina Abena, says in a Feb. 2 video that has amassed nearly 2 million views.\n\nAbena describes DD Café as “topless” in the TikTok, stating that she visited after searching for coffee shops in her area and finding the now-closed establishment. “They meant double D, like boobs,” she says of the business’s name. “So I walk in and everybody's naked. Quite literally, they're all naked. … I'm the only non-naked woman in the place.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nPolice have previously taken action against a “bikini café” in Garden Grove, Jensen told The Orange County Register.\n\nHe also told the newspaper that authorities believe that similar establishments are operating elsewhere in the area.",

    "description": "California's 91 Freeway uses AI cameras to catch solo HOV lane drivers, recovering $1 million in unpaid tolls through interior car photography.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-five thousand people monthly thought they were gaming the system on the 91 Express Lanes. Turns out, the house always wins — especially when it’s equipped with computer vision that can photograph your car’s interior through tinted windows. Since August 2025, Riverside County’s new Occupancy Detection System has been quietly documenting every solo driver pretending their gym bag is a passenger, recovering over $1 million in unpaid tolls and fees.\n\nThe technology reads like something from a dystopian Netflix series, except it’s scanning your morning commute. Cameras positioned at the end of the expressway capture multiple photographs of vehicle interiors. AI software flags potential violations before human reviewers at the Riverside County Transportation Commission confirm whether you actually have three people aboard. Get caught? You’ll pay the full toll plus a $5 “correction fee” — their polite term for getting busted.\n\nThis isn’t your typical red-light camera — the system spots fake passengers with unsettling accuracy.\n\nRCTC spokesperson Ariel Alcon reports catching drivers using “hats on headrests, putting items in baby car seats and even using mannequins” to fool the old enforcement system. The ODS isn’t impressed by your creativity. The technology distinguishes between actual humans and decoy passengers, even identifying properly installed car seats as legitimate occupants.\n\nConsider the scale: 400,000 cars use the 91 daily, with more than 100,000 breaking HOV rules. That’s roughly one in four drivers thinking they’re smarter than the system. Spoiler alert: they’re not.\n\nOfficials promise face-blurring and privacy compliance, but your driving habits are now permanent data.\n\nThe system protects privacy by blurring faces and storing images according to state and federal privacy laws. If you dispute a violation, you can call customer service at (800) 600-9191 or file online appeals through your 91 Express Lanes account. According to RCTC staff, most people don’t bother challenging charges once they learn about the cameras. That quiet acceptance speaks volumes about our collective resignation to surveillance infrastructure.\n\nThe 91’s success virtually guarantees expansion to other California carpool lanes. Your morning commute just became a case study in how automation transforms enforcement from occasional human oversight to constant digital monitoring. Welcome to the future — smile for the camera.\n\nFrom the coolest cars to the must-have gadgets, GadgetReview’s daily newsletter keeps you in the know. Subscribe - it’s fun, fast, and free.",

    "description": "The Meta founder’s donation to Sacramento State will help build “state-of-the-art STEM facilities” and a dedicated AI center.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is going all-in on AI and STEM with his philanthropic efforts. Late last year, he and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, announced they would shift the majority of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute to biomedical AI research. And late last month, the Meta founder and CEO pledged $50 million to Sacramento State University to fuel state-of-the-art STEM labs and an AI center.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled the gift on Jan. 28, tying it to a major redevelopment of three vacant state office buildings on Sacramento’s Capitol Mall into a downtown campus. The gift from Zuckerberg and Meta will fund abatement, demolition, and initial construction of the campus, enabling new student housing alongside new academic spaces, including STEM facilities and an AI center.\n\nMeta’s donation also comes at the heels of an interesting corporate and financial dynamic in California: Billionaires may soon be subject to a one-time 5% tax on their wealth. Many billionaires, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, have already moved their permanent residences out of state to avoid the tax.\n\nZuckerberg hasn’t made any public statements about the billionaires tax, and is instead doubling down on California investments and legacy.\n\n“These investments will help strengthen our communities and support the next generation of leaders and innovators,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. The Meta CEO also owns a compound of 11 properties in Palo Alto’s Crescent Park neighborhood, valued at more than $110 million. Minutes from his home, Meta has its sprawling 57-acre headquarters campus and also more than 400,000 square feet of office space nearby in Menlo Park.\n\nNewsom said Zuckerberg’s gift allows the Sacramento-based school to continue to build its talent pipeline for tech jobs.\n\nThe donation “[opens] doors for students to succeed and for our communities to prosper,” Newsom said. “Making sure students can actually afford to live where they learn is essential to that work.”\n\nWhile this recent donation comes directly from Meta and Zuckerberg, it also fits into the playbook they recently rewrote. Launched in 2015 with a pledge to give away 99% of their fortune, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has recently refocused on science, AI, and biomedical research, shifting emphasis away from its initial education and social justice priorities (although they say they’ll continue making other local donations).\n\nIn 2025, Zuckerberg and Chan laid the groundwork to recalibrate their philanthropic organization toward AI-powered biomedical research, with a particular focus on their flagship Biohub network. Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes, aims to “cure or prevent all disease,” according to Zuckerberg and Chan.",

    "description": "A federal judge on Monday blocked a California law from going into effect that would ban federal immigration agents from covering their faces, but they will still be required to wear clear identificat...",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge on Monday blocked a California law from going into effect that would ban federal immigration agents from covering their faces, but they will still be required to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to ban most law enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings under a bill that was signed in September following the summer of high-profile raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Trump administration filed a lawsuit in November challenging the laws, arguing that they would threaten the safety of officers who are facing harassment, doxing, and violence and that they violated the constitution because the state is directly regulating the federal government.\n\nJudge Christina Snyder said she issued the initial ruling because the mask ban as it was enacted did not also apply to state law enforcement authorities, discriminating against the federal government. The ruling could have national implications as states grapple with how to deal with federal agents enforcing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nIt left open the possibility to future legislation banning federal agents from wearing masks if it applied to all law enforcement agencies, with Snyder writing \"the Court finds that federal officers can perform their federal functions without wearing masks.” The ruling will go into effect Feb. 19.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill in September banning some law enforcement officers from wearing masks, neck gaiters, and other facial coverings. It was slated to go into effect Jan. 1 but was put on hold due to the lawsuit.\n\nIn addition to exempting state law enforcement officers, it made exceptions for undercover agents, protective equipment like N95 respirators or tactical gear, and other situations where not wearing a mask would jeopardize an operation. Snyder sided with the federal government, which argued this exemption was discriminatory against federal agents.\n\nNewsom also signed into law a measure requiring law enforcement to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number while on the job, which was challenged by the federal government but upheld by the judge.\n\nCalifornia State Sen. Scott Weiner, who proposed the original bill to ban facial coverings, said Monday he would immediately introduce new legislation to include state police in the law.\n\n“ICE and Border Patrol are covering their faces to maximize their terror campaign and to insulate themselves from accountability,” Weiner said in a news release. “We will ensure our mask ban can be enforced.”\n\nAt a Jan. 14 hearing, Snyder repeatedly asked the government’s lawyer, Tiberius Davis, to explain why banning masks would impede the federal law enforcement in carrying out their duties, if officers rarely wore masks prior to 2025.\n\nDavis cited claims by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that there has been a multifold increase in assaults and threats against federal officers. He also brought up an incident in Los Angeles where three women are being accused of livestreaming while following an ICE agent home and posting the address on Instagram.\n\n“There is real deterrence on the officer’s safety and ability to perform their duties,” Davis said.\n\nCameron Bell, California Department of Justice attorney, challenged his claims, saying there was no concrete evidence that federal agents can’t perform their duties without facial coverings.\n\nBell referenced declarations from U.S citizens who have been detained by federal agents but thought they were being kidnapped.\n\n“It’s obvious why these laws are in the public interest,” Bell said.\n\nThe federal government also argued in legal briefs that allowing California’s legislation could lead other states to be “emboldened to impose similar unconstitutional restraints.”\n\nDavis cited a statement from Newsom in July 2025 during an interview posted online where he discussed the mask ban bill, saying, “It appears that we don’t have the legal authority for federal agents but we do for other law enforcement authorities.”\n\nLos Angeles County supervisors voted in December to enact a local ordinance banning law enforcement from wearing masks that went into effect Jan. 8. However, the sheriff’s department said it would not enforce the ordinance until after the court ruled on the statewide mask ban. The Los Angeles Police Department had also said it wouldn’t enforce the mask ban.",

Then, on the following drive, Devon Witherspoon forced quarterback Drake Maye into a fumble that led to a defensive touchdown.\n\nWith the third youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl and the prospect of a potential franchise sale for billions of dollars, the future looks bright for the Seahawks.\n\nWhile the defence was dominant, and Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker was delivering the best rushing numbers in the event for 28 years, quarterback Sam Darnold was quietly putting together his own effective game.\n\nDrafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold's career plummeted, the nadir a game against the Patriots where he admitted to \"seeing ghosts\" in the face of their pressure.\n\nDiscarded by the Jets and the Carolina Panthers, he was back-up in San Francisco before getting a chance at the Minnesota Vikings.

Former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel took the reins last summer and has inspired a dramatic turnaround.\n\nKey to that has been the stellar play of sophomore quarterback Maye, who finished a narrow runner-up in the vote for regular season Most Valuable Player to Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHoping to make history as the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, Maye was hit six times and instead collected an undesirable record - his 21 sacks in the post-season the worst in NFL history.\n\nAfter only putting up 78 yards of offence through three quarters, he at least found some juice in the final quarter, throwing touchdowns to Mack Hollins and Rhamondre Stevenson.\n\nBut those late scores papered over the cracks as the Patriots were well beaten, and their bid for history put on hold for at least one more year.\n\nAmid protests and scrutiny over the tactics of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the choices for entertainment at the Super Bowl were not well received in the White House.\n\nWhen Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act in September, right-wing media circles noted he had criticised the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe subsequent decision to give vocal Trump critics Green Day a slot in the pre-game entertainment went down equally well.\n\nLast week, when Bad Bunny picked up his Grammy for Album of the Year, he began his acceptance speech with the words: \"ICE out.\"\n\nIt prompted one conservative group to organise an alternative half-time show, fronted by Trump ally Kid Rock and the president to label the selection \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\nOn the way in, anti-ICE protestors offered towels bearing political messaging to Super Bowl supporters.\n\nBad Bunny's unapologetically Latino set, performed across a temporary jungle in the middle of Levi's Stadium, did not douse Republican ire but provided plenty of entertainment for the 70,000 fans.\n\nThe most-streamed artist of 2025 was all bouncing energy, flanked by a myriad of dancers and through a whirlwind of movement and rapid lyrics, he became the first performer to conduct the half-time show fully in Spanish.\n\nThere was time to squeeze in some special guests, including compatriot Ricky Martin and pop royalty Lady Gaga, who performed an extract from her song 'Die With A Smile'. In English.\n\nFinally, as fireworks signalled the end of a high-octane set, Bad Bunny brandished the football he had been carrying to show the words 'Together, we are America', before disappearing from the field.\n\nPresident Trump, who became the first incumbent to attend the Super Bowl last year in New Orleans, was not there in person but labelled the show \"an affront to America\" and \"a slap in the face to our country\".\n\nThe Super Bowl is a magnet for celebrity guests and few are bigger than rock icon Jon Bon Jovi, who introduced the New England Patriots to the crowd before the game.\n\nOn the other side, Hollywood actor Chris Pratt did likewise for his beloved Seahawks, while actors Macauley Culkin and Jessica Alba were among those in attendance.\n\nThey were joined in the stands by rappers Jay-Z and Travis Scott, as well as Cardi B, in town to support boyfriend and Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs - and do some dancing alongside Bad Bunny.\n\nAs for sports stars, tennis legend Roger Federer and seven-time world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also watched on from the galleries.\n\nFinally, decorated quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Joe Montana joined Brady for the ceremonial coin toss.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Walker became the first running back since Terrell Davis in 1998 to win Super Bowl MVP, a rare honor in today’s quarterback-driven NFL.\n\nIn his post-game interview, Walker described the achievement as almost unbelievable, saying it was “just a dream come true” because many players never even reach the Super Bowl, let alone win MVP.\n\nBut beyond the individual accolade, Walker highlighted the adversities the Seahawks overcame this season:\n\nHe thanked his teammates and emphasized the team’s resilience, noting, “We went through a lot of adversity this season, but we came together, and we stuck together, and this is what we got.”\n\nWalker shouldered a heavier workload down the stretch after Seattle’s offense lost running back Zach Charbonnet to a torn ACL in the playoffs, proving his ability to lead even through tough circumstances.\n\nWalker’s MVP performance not only helped deliver a Super Bowl title but also snapped a decades-long drought for running backs winning the MVP award, underscoring both how well he played and how meaningful the achievement was for his position.\n\nThe post Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III Recalls Seahawks’ Adversities After Winning What Saquon Barkley Couldn’t Last Year appeared first on The SportsRush.",

In English.\n\nFinally, as fireworks signalled the end of a high-octane set, Bad Bunny brandished the football he had been carrying to show the words 'Together, we are America', before disappearing from the field.\n\nPresident Trump, who became the first incumbent to attend the Super Bowl last year in New Orleans, was not there in person but labelled the show \"an affront to America\" and \"a slap in the face to our country\".\n\nBad Bunny piles on Puerto Rican patriotism at Super Bowl half-time show\n\nWhat is ICE and what powers do its agents have to use force?\n\nThe Super Bowl is a magnet for celebrity guests and few are bigger than rock icon Jon Bon Jovi, who introduced the New England Patriots to the crowd before the game.\n\nOn the other side, Hollywood actor Chris Pratt did likewise for his beloved Seahawks, while actors Macauley Culkin and Jessica Alba were among those in attendance.\n\nThey were joined in the stands by rappers Jay-Z and Travis Scott, as well as Cardi B, in town to support boyfriend and Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs - and do some dancing alongside Bad Bunny.\n\nAs for sports stars, tennis legend Roger Federer and seven-time world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also watched on from the galleries.\n\nFinally, decorated quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Joe Montana joined Brady for the ceremonial coin toss.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Arizona’s first season in the Big 12 Conference was an eye opener, both in terms of the significant bump in competition from the Pac-12 and the hostile atmospheres it entered. No more trips to half-empty gyms in Corvallis or Pullman, or ones in California with nearly as many UA fans as ones for the home team.\n\nTrips to Lubbock, Manhattan, Ames and Lawrence all ended badly. The opponent had a lot to do with that, but so did the crowds. All four games were sellouts, the atmospheres electric.\n\nThe second time around has been much better for Arizona (23-0, 10-0) on the road in the Big 12. It’s won at Utah, TCU, UCF, BYU and ASU, in addition to a nonconference win at UConn in November, the six consecutive road wins the longest in-season streak since 2016-17.\n\nBut now comes a trip to the last road venue that the UA lost in, Kansas’ Allen Fieldhouse. The Wildcats fell 83-76 in Lawrence to end the 2024-25 regular season, keeping Jayhawks coach Bill Self perfect on Senior Day.\n\nSelf, who is in his 23rd season at Kansas, has also never lost at home on Big Monday. He’s 38-0 , with the Jayhawks’ last Big 12 home loss on a Monday coming in 2001.\n\nBut Kansas (18-5, 8-2) has also never beaten a No. 1 team at Allen Fieldhouse, going 0-5 in such opportunities. The last was in 2003, when top-ranked Arizona came to town and won 91-74.\n\n“It’s going to be an awesome atmosphere,” UA coach Tommy Lloyd said. “And I just have a feeling those Jayhawk fans are going to be out for blood. So you know what? We’re here for it.”\n\nArizona is a 2.5-point favorite, per FanDuel Sportsbook, and if that holds it would be just the sixth time Kansas has been a home underdog since 1996.\n\nHere’s what to watch for when the UA and KU meet on Monday night:\n\nDepending on which expert you listen to, or which sportsbook you check out, the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft is probably going to be one of two freshmen from the Big 12. Arizona has already faced BYU wing AJ Dybantsa, now it gets a crack at Kansas guard Darryn Peterson.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Peterson is averaging 20.5 points per game, 21.1 in Big 12 play, and makes 41.7 percent of his 3-point shots. He has scored in double figures every time out, going for 18 in 20 minutes against BYU and nailing the tying and winning 3s in the final 1:20 of a win at Texas Tech last week.\n\nBut Peterson has also missed quite a bit of time due to injury. He’s sat out 10 games, nine during nonconference play, did not play at Kansas State on Jan. 24 and a week later didn’t play the second half against BYU because of cramping.\n\nThe last two games, at Texas Tech and vs. Utah, saw him play 30-plus minutes but also post two of his lowest offensive ratings of the season.\n\nLike BYU, Kansas isn’t just its potential No. 1 pick. Three other Jayhawks average more than 14 points in Big 12 games, with guard Melvin Council dropping 36 at NC State in December scoring 22 in an OT win over TCU last month that saw his team rally from down 15 with less than five minutes to go.\n\nKansas also has the top shot blocker in the conference in 6-foot-10 sophomore Flory Bidunga. Bidunga has swatted 65 shots this season, averaging 3.8 in Big 12 play with seven against Utah on Saturday, and is shooting 78.5 percent in conference action.\n\nDepth could be an issue for Kansas, though. Only two bench players average double figures in minutes and guard Elmarko Jackson missed the last game. Self has said Jackson will play against Arizona but may not be 100 percent.\n\nBidunga and starting center Bryson Tiller, a 6-11 freshman, have been good at avoiding foul trouble but if they do get whistled there’s not much behind them to eat minutes.\n\nArizona has outrebounded every opponent this season, finishing plus-20 against Oklahoma State last time out, and is limiting Big 12 foes to boards on 25.6 percent of their misses. That’s tops in the conference, while Kansas is the worst offensive rebounding team in the league.\n\nKansas got 42 of its 71 points against Utah in the paint but also gave up 32 (of 57). The Jayhawks are +6.4 in paint points for the season, +8 in Big 12 games. Arizona, which won the paint battle 54-14 against Oklahoma State, is +19.2 in conference play.\n\nArizona may need to attempt a few more 3-pointers in this one, though, as Kansas is third-best in the Big 12 in 2-point defense. Bidunga’s shot blocking has a lot to do with that.\n\nBrayden Burries was Arizona’s leading scorer for the seventh time, fourth in Big 12 play, but for the 12th time this season the Wildcats had at least five players in double figures. Every member of the 8-man rotation has either led or tied for the lead in scoring in a game, with five different guys doing that in conference games.\n\n“I just feel like our versatility, and we know how deep we are,” Jaden Bradley said when asked about the key to Arizona’s unbeaten start. “It can be anybody’s night, the bigs, the guards, and I feel like everybody’s happy for one another. And I feel like that’s special. You don’t see that too often.”\n\nKansas could have a front row seat for another Bradley masterclass, which he’s mostly saved for ranked foes. The senior guard is averaging 19.7 points in Arizona’s six games against ranked teams, shooting 56.9 percent, and 18.8 points in Big 12 road contests.",

    "fullText": "Sam Darnold has been facing challenges all throughout his time playing football since his days at San Clemente (Calif.). Now the former California high school football star will get his chance on the grandest stage of them all, Super Bowl LX, to show why he’s one of the best to have ever come out of the Golden State.\n\nThrough Darnold’s sophomore and junior seasons with the Tritons, the Super Bowl starting quarterback had seen minimal time on the field at San Clemente, totaling 748 yards and seven touchdowns. It would be Darnold’s senior year where the signal caller would blossom into his own before heading off to become a USC Trojan.\n\nDuring his senior campaign with the Tritons, Darnold had himself a strong season and ended up completing 213-of-314 passes for 2,985 yards and 39 touchdowns. The four-star prospect showed off his wheels on the ground, rushing for 785 yards and 13 touchdowns.\n\nAfter his high school playing days at San Clemente, Darnold was already committed to USC, making his decision during the summer of 2014 heading into his senior season and would head into a crowded quarterback room with the Trojans.\n\nPlaying two seasons at USC with a redshirt freshman campaign, the 6-foot-3, 221-pound passer completing 549-of-846 passes for 7,229 yards and 57 touchdowns before being selected as the No. 3 pick of the 2018 NFL Draft by the New York Jets.\n\nNow heading into Sunday’s Super Bowl matchup with the six-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, Darnold has a chance one more time to prove the naysayers wrong and overcoming one more challenge in his path.\n\n“Sam Darnold was sort of a late bloomer (in high school). USC had their quarterback room all set and it was gonna go from (Cody) Kessler to Ricky Town. A lot of schools early on wanted Sam to play tight end. The issue at that time he wasn’t doing a lot of camps or 7-on-7. First time I saw him at Mission Viejo 7-on-7 tournament and he was outstanding. He made all the the grows and was superb. The way his recruitment went, he to a camp at USC and Clay Helton was the HC at the time. The staff said they had to go after him at the time after seeing him. Oregon, Duke were also after him during the recruitment him. Darnold and his dad went to a lot of USC games. I think that’s a testament to his fortitude. Is it surprising, certainly. Just knowing him and his HC. Knowing he’s a tough kid. He was walking into a very tough QB at USC and he stayed resilient.” – Rivals National Recruiting reporter Adam Gorney\n\nSan Clemente High School, located in the coastal town of San Clemente, California, serves around 3,000 students from the city and surrounding areas, including Capistrano Beach and San Juan Capistrano. Established in 1964, the school is part of the Capistrano Unified School District and boasts a robust athletics program with a strong community presence under the motto “One Town, One Team.” The Tritons are recognized for their competitive spirit across various sports disciplines.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "fullText": "Organizers in Monterey Park took inspiration from other US cities to fight against the construction of a giant datacenter\n\nWhen a southern California city council proposed building a giant datacenter the size of four football fields last December, five residents vowed to stop it.\n\nThrough a frenetic word-of-mouth campaign, the small group raised awareness about the proposed facility in Monterey Park, a small city east of Los Angeles known affectionately as the country’s first suburban Chinatown.\n\nNo Data Center Monterey Park organizers – working in tandem with the grassroots racial justice group San Gabriel Valley (SGV) Progressive Action – held a teach-in and rally that drew hundreds of participants, knocked on doors, and distributed flyers on busy streets.\n\nThey emphasized how the computer systems facility would strain the power grid, drive up energy rates and create noise pollution. A petition quickly amassed nearly 5,000 signatures. All the materials were shared in English, Chinese and Spanish – a concerted effort to reach Monterey Park’s diverse populace, which is two-thirds Asian and one-quarter Hispanic.\n\nIn just six weeks, the community won. City leaders issued a 45-day moratorium on datacenter construction and a pledge to explore a permanent ban.\n\n“It’s like the third act of an Oscar-winning movie,” said Steven Kung, a co-founder of No Data Center Monterey Park.\n\nOver the past year, homegrown revolts against datacenters have united a fractured nation, animating local board meetings from coast to coast in both farming towns and middle-class suburbs. Local communities delayed or cancelled $98bn worth of projects from late March 2025 to June 2025, according to research from the group Data Center Watch, which has been tracking opposition to the sites since 2023. More than 50 active groups across 17 states targeted 30 projects during that time period, two-thirds of which were halted.\n\nThe movement against these facilities has even made for strange bedfellows, bringing together nimbys and environmentalists in Virginia, “Stop the Steal” activists and Democratic Socialists of America organizers in Michigan.\n\n“There’s no safe space for datacenters,” said Miquel Vila, lead analyst at Data Center Watch, a research project run by AI security company 10a Labs. “Opposition is happening in very different communities.”\n\nDatacenters have exploded in states with abundant land, cheap power and generous tax breaks. Though the facilities power everything from streaming services to artificial intelligence, functioning as an engine for our digital lives, few people seem to want these sites that drain enormous amounts of water and energy, causing energy costs to soar. A November Morning Consult poll found that a majority of voters support banning datacenter construction near where they live and say “AI datacenters” are partly responsible for rising electricity prices.\n\nVila said a spike in media coverage from national outlets, particularly of protests in the north-east and midwest, had helped consolidate local campaigns against datacenters into a movement. The proliferation of the centers “has become a hot topic at a national level, which reinforces local dynamics”, Vila said.\n\nIn Indiana, a datacenter hub with more than 70 facilities, local communities are fighting another 50 projects and have halted at least a dozen in the past year, according to data from Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis-based consumer and environmental advocacy non-profit.\n\n“It’s like a revolt in the heartland,” said Bryce Gustafson, who organizes with the Citizens Action Coalition. “There’s an unbelievable amount of pushback, bipartisan and non-partisan, against these datacenters.”\n\nThe datacenter rebellion in the Republican stronghold of Indiana, he said, was built in part on a strong backlash in recent years against solar projects on farmland that many residents felt threatened the state’s rural character. The same concerns over land privatization and tech overreach carried over to the fight against datacenters, as conservatives and environmentalists joined forces to organize town halls, conduct canvassing training and file lawsuits to block developments.\n\n“For many Hoosiers, datacenters have become a physical manifestation of their mistrust of big tech, the elected officials who have embraced them, and the system that allows all this to happen,” Gustafson said.\n\nLocal fights against AI infrastructure have even begun to turn the tide at the state and federal levels as the midterms approach. In Virginia – the datacenter capital of the world with more than 600 facilities – the newly elected governor, Abigail Spanberger, campaigned on lowering utility bills by ensuring that AI companies are paying “their fair share” of electricity costs rather than passing them on to consumers. The progressive lawmakers Bernie Sanders and Rashida Tlaib have publicly backed calls for a datacenter moratorium. GOP leaders, including the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and Missouri senator Josh Hawley, have also introduced bills to regulate AI.\n\nIn Monterey Park, concerns over the proposed datacenter are primarily about its economic, environmental and public health impact. The facility would employ 14 on-site diesel generators, which researchers said produce “ambient air pollutants”, such as nitrogen oxide, that are linked to a host of respiratory illnesses, including asthma and lung cancer.\n\nOrganizer Hrag Balian said No in Data Center Monterey Park took inspiration from other communities’ organizing, including protests in Virginia and Pennsylvania that have stalled projects. “None of us had experience doing this, so seeing patterns and parallels have been tremendously helpful.”\n\nKung said a core tenet of the group’s organizing strategy was building coalitions with different community organizations in the greater San Gabriel Valley area, such as SGV Progressive Action, Asian Youth Center and Montebello Teachers Association. All these community groups mobilized their own members to show up and testify at the January city council meeting. “It’s a decentralized movement,” Kung said.\n\nAndrew Yip, a community organizer with SGV Progressive Action who helped create flyers and organize rallies, said the campaign succeeded because residents were able to put aside their differences and rally around a single cause: halting a development that would affect their livelihoods.\n\n“This is about community members rising to the occasion to look out for one another,” Yip said.\n\nFor Monterey Park organizers, the fight is far from over. Rather than gutting the proposed facility themselves, city council members are considering placing the decision before voters on the November ballot. Kung said the move would put the onus on residents to develop a “long, drawn-out awareness campaign” about datacenters for the remainder of the year. In the meantime, the organizers have continued to engage new neighbors, gather signatures for the petition, and show up at council meetings.\n\n“We won a victory, but there’s still a lot of work to do,” Kung said.",

    "description": "Nevada and Las Vegas' luxury market is booming thanks to an influx of billionaires fleeing California's proposed Billionaire Tax Act.",
    "fullText": "The most expensive condo sale in the Las Vegas area closed in early January for $21 million. If the sale of the 5,000-square-foot penthouse about 15 miles from the Las Vegas Strip had closed just a little more than a week earlier, it potentially could have saved the buyer a few hundred million dollars.\n\n\"He was looking for a while, and at the last minute, there was a little bit of a hiccup,\" real estate agent Ivan Sher told Business Insider of the sale. \"He was actually even under contract significantly before then.\"\n\nThat \"he\" is billionaire Don Hankey, the chairman of Hankey Group and a lifelong Californian worth a reported $8.2 billion.\n\nHankey is one of a handful of Californians who have decided leave the state due to the proposed Billionaire Tax Act — a bill that would subject California residents worth more than $1 billion to a one-time tax worth 5% of their assets. For someone like Hankey, that's about $410 million.\n\n\"I just felt a little bit like I wasn't wanted,\" Hankey told Forbes of why he chose to leave California.\n\nWhile Hankey may still be on the hook for the billionaire tax — the bill will be on the ballot in November 2026 and would retroactively tax individuals who were living in California on January 1, 2026 if passed — Nevada has welcomed Hankey and other high-net-worth individuals with open arms.\n\nFor the ultrawealthy ready to ditch California, but not the West Coast, Nevada offers a happy medium. With tax perks similar to Florida's — no income tax and low property taxes — Nevada is slowly becoming the next nerve center for the rich.\n\nSher, who repped Hankey's $21 million penthouse sale on both sides as the founder of real estate agency IS Luxury, said that while Las Vegas' luxury market was already heating up, the news out of California kicked it into a higher gear.\n\n\"If people were to ask me what percentage of my buyers were from California, I'd say probably about 25%, and then for the first few years after COVID, that number was closer to 80%,\" Sher said. \"As soon as that billionaire tax was proposed, the exodus began again — but at a much higher level.\"\n\nThe Las Vegas metropolitan area had about 331 millionaire households in 2019, according to RentCafe data. In 2023, that number jumped 166% to 879 households.\n\nNatalia Harris has been selling ultra-luxury real estate in the Las Vegas area for the last five years. In that time, she said the definition of \"ultra-luxury\" has changed in the Silver State.\n\n\"Back then, a home that was $10 million was 'Wow' for Vegas — that was at the top of the price point,\" Harris told Business Insider. \"Now we have three new listings that we just brought to market last week that are all between $11 million and $20 million.\"\n\nZain Aziz, the founder of technology firm Atom and one of Harris' high-net-worth clients, moved to the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, Nevada, in 2025. He said leaving the high taxes and hectic lifestyle of Silicon Valley behind was bittersweet.\n\n\"You don't really want to get punished if you do good and you create more jobs,\" Aziz said. \"I believe the Las Vegas Valley has become more and more what's synonymous with what California used to be — which was free-spirited and 'Come and achieve the impossible,'\" he added.\n\nAziz isn't the only one taking his assets elsewhere. Google cofounder Sergey Brin recently spent $42 million on a Lake Tahoe home on the Nevada side, according to Bloomberg. Larry Page, Google's other cofounder, found a tax haven on the East Coast, buying two properties totaling about $173 million in South Florida.\n\nBillionaire Larry Ellison, who owns homes across the country and the world, bought a handful of properties in Lake Tahoe near the California-Nevada border. He also recently sold his San Francisco home for $45 million in the largest sale in the area in 2025, according to the San Francisco Standard.\n\nAziz, who also moved his business to Nevada, said the culture that built California giants like Oracle and Google no longer exists there — it's budding in the next state over.\n\n\"There's no longer that innovative culture, and I believe where it exists is Vegas,\" Aziz said. \"I think that a lot of people from California who are chasing that are going to move to Vegas primarily because of the proximity to California.\"\n\nFor lifelong Californians not fully ready to leave the state's sunny weather and stellar beaches behind, Las Vegas is a less than two-hour flight to Los Angeles or San Francisco.\n\nIt also helps that certain areas of Nevada can offer a taste of home. Harris described the MacDonald Highlands neighborhood of Las Vegas, which is about 15 minutes from the Las Vegas Strip, as the Hollywood Hills of Vegas, offering stunning mountain views that give way to a sparkling cityscape beneath.\n\nFor Aziz, the developments in Nevada represent promise.\n\n\"This will become the hub for the wealthiest,\" he said. \"The city wants that.\"",

    "fullText": "The federal Small Business Administration suspended more than 111,000 California borrowers after uncovering $8.6 billion in suspected fraudulent activity linked to the COVID pandemic, SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler announced Friday.\n\n\"We have suspended nearly 112,000 borrowers tied to at least $9 billion in suspected fraud,\" Loeffler said in a press release on Friday. \"This staggering number represents the most significant crack-down on those who defrauded pandemic programs, and it illuminates the scale of corruption that the Biden Administration tolerated for years.\"\n\nThe SBA reported that all in, it suspended 111,620 California borrowers who received 118,489 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) loans, totaling $8.6 billion.\n\nThe Border Gets The Attention While Fraudulent Government Benefits Bleed Taxpayers Dry\n\nPPP loans were a COVID-era federal relief program that gave small businesses money to keep workers on the payroll, while EIDL loans are part of an SBA program that provides low-interest disaster relief loans to help businesses survive during times of diaster, including the pandemic.\n\n\"Once again, the Trump SBA is taking decisive action to deliver accountability in a state whose unaccountable welfare policies have created a culture of fraud and abuse at the expense of law-abiding taxpayers and small business owners,\" Loffler continued.\n\nChildcare Expert Exposes Key Roadblock To Uncovering Potential Fraud Schemes In Minnesota: 'Really Difficult'\n\nThe announcement follows California Attorney General Rob Bonta saying on Thursday that the Trump administration was promoting \"baseless claims\" of persistent fraud in the state.\n\n\"Trump claims California is wasting money when, in reality, our programs are helping lower-income individuals and lower-income families get healthcare, food and housing assistance,\" Bonta said on Thursday.\n\n\"Trump claims, wrongly, California is perpetuating fraud when we are the victim,\" he added.\n\nBonta's office noted that California has recovered nearly $2.7 billion in various fraud schemes across the last 10 years, \"including by partnering with the federal government.\"\n\nExclusive: Senate Bill Targets Minnesota-style ‘Runaway Fraud’ To Force Scammers Repay Taxpayers\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Bonta's office on Friday for additional comment.\n\nNewsom's office directed Fox News Digital to the Governor Newsom Press Office X account, which mocked the SBA announcement.\n\n\"OMG. The Trump Administration found MAJOR FRAUD in programs THEY control, Newsom's Press Office's X account posted, linking to a New York Post exclusive on the announcement.\n\n\"The state has no role running / administering these programs.Were they hiding this??? California doesn’t hide fraud … we fight it. Nearly 1,000 arrests + over $125 billion STOPPED under @CAGovernor Gavin Newsom.\"\n\nLoeffler continued that the alleged California fraud comes after the SBA suspended 6,900 borrowers in Minnesota associated with 7,900 potentially fraudulent PPP and EIDL loans, which totaled roughly $400 million.\n\n\"As we did in Minnesota, we are actively working with federal law enforcement to identify the criminals who defrauded American taxpayers, hold them to account, and recoup the stolen funds. As we continue our state-by-state work, our message is clear: pandemic-era fraudsters will not get a pass under this Administration,\" Loeffler said, comparing California to its investigations in Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota became ground zero for welfare and social services fraud surrounding the pandemic late in 2025, when investigators uncovered sweeping fraud schemes that could top $9 billion.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "A woman in California used “an unconventional storage method” for trying to hide her unlawful catch of two abalone, an endangered species. Unfortunately for her, a wildlife officer was watching.\n\nThe unidentified poacher was with a man legally taking purple sea urchins in the intertidal zone at Van Damme State Park, located three hours north of San Francisco.\n\nA wildlife officer was observing the couple from a distance using a spotting scope, as reported by the California Department of Fish and Wildilfe.\n\nHe witnessed the woman discreetly conceal what appeared to be an abalone down her pants, “an unconventional storage method, to say the least,” the CDFW stated.\n\nAs the couple headed toward their vehicle, the wildlife officer contacted them in the parking lot to check their licenses and inspect their catch. While doing so, the wildlife officer asked the female what she had concealed.\n\nThe woman then pulled out a small abalone from inside her pants.\n\nThe wildlife officer then called for assistance from a female wildlife officer to conduct a search, suspecting she might be hiding more abalone.\n\nThen the suspect voluntarily produced a second abalone from her pants. No additional abalone were found.\n\nThe woman was cited for the illegal take of two abalone. The male was in compliance and did not possess any abalone.\n\nAn article posted in 2022 by UC Davis revealed that all species of abalone along the West Coast are listed as critically endangered or endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nMeanwhile, the bag limit for purple sea urchins is 35 individuals, according to California Department of Fish and Wildlife regulations.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Woman caught poaching endangered species, hiding them in her pants",

The mom, who’s been identified as Jacqueline Hernandez, 35, of La Habra, Calif., then stopped short, nearly causing the car behind her to rear-end her, per New York Post.\n\nA video released by police shows another car almost running over the tyke, but its driver managed to slam on the brakes just feet away from the baby.\n\nHernandez is then seen running around to the passenger side to pick up the child.\n\nPolice were only alerted to the incident when a witness came forward and reported it. The information enabled them to identify the mother. Hernandez was then arrested on suspicion of felony child abuse, the Fullerton police said in a statement.\n\nThe toddler was injured in the fall but was expected to make a full recovery after being treated at a hospital.\n\n“Why was the baby in the front seat, and not in a car seat in the back buckled up,” asked one commenter on Instagram.\n\nUnder California law, children under 2 need to be placed in a rear-facing car seat, and until age 8, children must ride in the back seat.\n\n“This made me sick to my stomach,” another viewer commented on Instagram. “So happy the baby will make a full recovery.”\n\nSavannah Guthrie’s Brother Issues New Emotional Plea for Missing Mom as First Ransom Deadline Passes\n\nPatrick Mahomes Sr. Reportedly Remains in Jail, Could Face 10-Year Sentence for Violating Probation\n\nKaroline Leavitt ‘Can’t Guarantee’ ICE Agents ‘Won’t Be Around a Polling Location’ During Elections\n\nThis story California Woman Arrested on Felony Child Abuse After 19-Month-Old Baby Tumbles Out of SUV first appeared on National Enquirer.

    "fullText": "A California man whom an FBI official slammed as a \"total imposter\" was arrested and charged Thursday over allegations that he sent a fake ransom demand for Nancy Guthrie, the mother of \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie.\n\n\"Did you get the bitcoin were [sic] waiting on our end for the transaction,\" Derrick Callella texted two family members of Nancy Guthrie on Wednesday, following reports of a ransom demand tied to the elderly woman's disappearance that listed a Bitcoin wallet address, his criminal complaint said.\n\nThe complaint, filed in Arizona federal court, said Callella admitted to sending the messages. It was not immediately clear whether Callella had retained an attorney.\n\nAuthorities believe the 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie was taken from her ranch-style home just outside Tucson, Arizona, in the Catalina Foothills five days ago.\n\nFBI Phoenix's special agent in charge, Heith Janke, announced the arrest on Thursday at a press conference over Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.\n\nThe FBI official said the arrest was related to an \"imposter ransom demand\" for the woman. \"It was someone that was trying to profit from it — a total imposter,\" Janke said.\n\nJanke also issued a message to anyone involved in Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, urging them to \"do the right thing.\"\n\n\"This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her well-being,\" Janke said.\n\nThe FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the recovery of Nancy Guthrie or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance, Janke announced.\n\nAuthorities said that an additional ransom letter regarding Nancy Guthrie, sent to local and national media outlets, is being taken \"seriously.\"\n\nThat note made a monetary \"demand\" for 5 p.m. local time Thursday, said Janke.\n\n\"If a transfer wasn't made, then I think a second demand was for next Monday,\" Janke said, declining to provide other specifics.\n\nAn Apple Watch and a floodlight were also mentioned in ransom letters, Janke said.\n\n\"We're not going to go into specifics. It's very important that we keep this investigation moving forward, and we don't want to put more facts out there that others then can use to try to profit from this,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities revealed new details around the timeline of Nancy Guthrie's disappearance on Thursday and confirmed that the blood discovered on the elderly woman's porch belonged to her.\n\nNancy Guthrie was dropped off at her home by her family just before 10 p.m. on January 31. At 1:47 a.m. MST the next day, the woman's doorbell camera disconnected, police said.\n\nAt 2:12 a.m., the doorbell software detected a person on the camera, but there was no available video footage, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said during the Thursday press conference. Minutes later, Nancy Guthrie's pacemaker app showed a disconnect from her phone.\n\nHer family checked in on her at 11:56 a.m. and called 911 shortly after, police said.\n\nNanos said that Nancy Guthrie's doorbell camera had also been removed. No suspects or persons of interest have yet been identified in the case, the sheriff said.\n\nOn Wednesday, in an emotional video post alongside her siblings, Savannah Guthrie pleaded to her mother's possible abductors to \"please reach out to us.\"\n\n\"We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk,\" the famed NBC anchor said, adding, \"We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.\"\n\nNancy Guthrie suffers from physical ailments and requires daily medications that, if not taken every 24 hours, could have life-threatening consequences.\n\n\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" Nanos said.",

    "fullText": "A jaw-dropping video captured the traumatic moment a 12-year-old girl plunged to the ground after dangling momentarily from a ski chairlift in California.\n\nThe frightening incident happened Saturday at Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort, where the visiting snowboarder appeared to be unsecured on the chairlift.\n\nIn a video that went viral on social media, the girl appeared to grip the chairlift in a desperate struggle as her feet flailed in the air, still strapped to her snowboard.\n\nSeveral mountain staff members were then seen rushing over to help, placing padding and a safety net below in an attempt to catch her fall.\n\nSkydiver Survives After Reserve Parachute Accidentally Deploys, Leaving Him Dangling From Flying Airplane\n\nThe girl then crashed to the ground, tragically missing most of the safety net, according to the footage.

She indicated that the chair slipped almost immediately after her daughter got on, leaving no time to secure it.\n\n\"As to the bar - we had no chance,\" she added. \"She slipped down right away. There was nothing that anyone did wrong. It was a series of small choices that happened quickly that led to a fluke accident.\"\n\nIn the video, the girl appears to be sitting next to two other people before falling. According to her mother, the group held onto her as long as possible, which gave rescuers time to respond.\n\n\"As a mother I know it is my job to protect my child,\" she said. \"We held on as long as we could. Long enough to have people get into position to allow her to walk away.\"\n\nDespite the traumatic experience, she said the family will not be deterred from skiing and \"will be riding again when she’s ready.\"\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "A discussion about California Governor Gavin Newsom’s presidential prospects ended with Jessica Tarlov telling Jesse Watters, “You’re gross.”\n\nOn Wednesday’s installment of The Five on Fox News, Tarlov said Newsom’s opponents will attempt to use California as a cudgel to try to derail his aspirations.\n\n“There’s push and pull, but this is what the debate is going to be,” she said. “Like when he was up there with Ron DeSantis when they did that debate with Sean Hannity and, they went California v. Florida. And when you come from a coastal state, especially one as big as California, and they definitely had some bad years. We covered a lot of poop on the sidewalks in San Francisco and things like that. It’s going to be tough in a Democratic Primary. But he’s not afraid of the challenge. And Democrats are looking for someone at this moment who will stand up and fight. And he is ready to do that.”\n\nWatters responded by questioning whether Newsom’s identity as a straight white man will pose an issue in 2028. Co-host Greg Gutfeld also jumped in and helped send the segment off the rails:\n\nWATTERS: And he’s a straight white man. Is that gonna be a problem, Jessica?TARLOV: I am very into straight white men myself. I married one. So, I think it’s gonna be fine.WATTERS: Ok.GUTFELD: How dare you.TARLOV: What? Him or me?GUTFELD: You are now into straight white men?TARLOV: Not exclusively. I like everybody, I guess, but I married one.GUTFELD: Ok.WATTERS: Is he Christian?TARLOV: Brian was raised Catholic.WATTERS: Ok, just checking. Just wanna make sure we check all the boxes.TARLOV: Also, all religions are good and fine.GUTFELD: All of them?WATTERS: I like it on the record here. Even Islam?TARLOV: Get out. You’re really gross.WATTERS: I’m just kidding. We love Muslims.\n\nThe post ‘You’re Really Gross’: Jessica Tarlov Disgusted by Jesse Watters’ Questions About Her Dating Preferences first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump will not be attending the Super Bowl after being warned he would likely be resoundingly booed by the crowd inside the stadium, according to a report.\n\nThe thin-skinned president had previously offered the unlikely excuse that he would not attend the NFL championship game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots on Sunday in Santa Clara, California, because it was “too far away” and because he disliked the planned performers, Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\nHowever, several of Trump’s advisers have now told Zeteo that the 79-year-old was urged not to attend the game in the deep-blue Democratic state because he would likely receive a less-than-friendly reception.\n\nClips of Trump being loudly booed in front of tens of thousands of spectators—and potentially more than 100 million viewers at home—going viral would be “another thing we don’t want right now,” one Trump adviser told Zeteo.\n\nTrump was met with a mixture of boos and cheers when he attended last year’s Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nBut since then his approval ratings have plummeted across the board, with the president losing support over his handling of the economy and his hardline immigration policies, particularly in the wake of the killing of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n\nTrump’s dire polling numbers, combined with the Super Bowl being held in a state that has overwhelmingly rejected him in the past three presidential elections, led one aide to conclude it was “best to stay away from this one.”\n\n“Whatever [the crowd’s makeup] ends up being, it’s not gonna be a Turning Point USA speech,” the aide said.\n\nTrump told the New York Post last month that he would skip this year’s Super Bowl because he was unhappy that Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny would be performing the halftime show. Veteran punk rockers Green Day, who are also vocal critics of the president, are performing at the Super Bowl opening ceremony.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nTurning Point USA announced that MAGA country singer Kid Rock will headline its “All American Halftime Show,” scheduled to take place at the same time as the official halftime performance from Latin superstar Bad Bunny, who predominantly sings in Spanish.\n\nTrump also offered the dubious explanation that he was unwilling to travel to California because it was “just too far away,” despite regularly flying around the world and having attended last year’s Super Bowl in New Orleans.\n\nHe told the New York Post that he would be welcomed by the crowd if he dared to go. “They like me,” he said.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Davis Ingle insisted that Trump would receive a warm welcome if he attended Super Bowl LX in person.\n\n“President Trump is working hard on behalf of the American people,” Ingle told Zeteo. “If he did attend the Super Bowl, he would receive a warm welcome because America knows he has done more to help this country than any other president in history.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "Halle Berry told The Cut that she never heard from California governor Gavin Newsom despite him saying they would be “reconciling” their differences over his lack of support for the Menopause Care Equity Act and his previous veto of a similar bill.\n\n“It’s disturbing when people say they’re going to do things and then they don’t,” Berry told the publication. “But he heard what I said. If he is going to run to be our next president, he can’t sleep on women. Wake up, Gavin.”\n\nHalle Berry Won an Oscar and Says 'I Was Still Black the Next Morning' With Directors Refusing to Cast Her; She Later Advised Cynthia Erivo That Oscar Wins 'Cannot Be Validation'\n\nNicki Minaj and Gavin Newsom Feud Intensifies: Rapper Doubles Down on Slamming Governor's Trans Advocacy, as He Posts Diss Track\n\nNicki Minaj Says It's 'Impossible' For Gavin Newsom to Become President in 2028: 'He Thinks He's Tom Cruise'\n\nBerry’s beef with Newsom went public last December when she spoke candidly at the New York Times DealBook Summit about Newsom’s potential presidential run. The Oscar winner declared: “With the way he’s overlooked women, half the population, by devaluing us in midlife, he probably should not be the next president.”\n\n“[If men] had a medical condition that disrupted their sleep, brain function and sex life, we’d be calling that a health crisis on par with Covid, and the whole world would shut down,” Berry added, knocking Newsom for not supporting the Menopause Care Equity Act. “When women are struggling silently through perimenopause and menopause, trying to hold their families, careers, relationships and communities together, it doesn’t just affect women, it affects every household. It affects the workplace, it affects the economy. One in six women leave the workplace due to their menopausal symptoms. So it affects everybody.”\n\nThe bill Newsom did not support would have mandated comprehensive insurance coverage for medically necessary menopause and perimenopause treatments, required doctors to complete continuing education on menopause and directed the medical board to develop a continuing education curriculum.\n\n“I need every woman in this country to fight with me,” Berry said. “But the truth is, the fight isn’t just for us women. We need men too. We need all of the leaders, every single one of you in this room – this fight needs you. We need you to stay curious. We need you to ask questions. We need you to care even when the topic feels unfamiliar and uncomfortable.”\n\nNewsom told TMZ as Berry’s takedown of him went viral that “we’re reconciling this,” but Berry told The Cut she never heard from him.\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom responded in December to Berry’s remarks, explaining his reasons for the veto by writing: “The Governor has deep admiration for Ms. Berry’s advocacy and looks forward to working with her and other stakeholders on this critical issue. He shares her goal of expanding access to menopause care that too many women struggle to get. He vetoed the bill because, as written, it would have unintentionally raised health care costs for millions of working women and working families already stretched thin — something he’s determined to avoid. We’re confident that by working together this year, we can expand access to essential menopause treatment while protecting women from higher bills.”\n\nIn regards to Berry’s latest comments to The Cut, a spokesperson for Newsom told The Independent: “Ms. Berry’s remarks are very unfortunate given the Governor’s proposal put forward to support menopause care through the state budget, just as he said he would do in his veto message on AB 432.”\n\nOscars: Original Screenplay — 'Sinners,' 'Sentimental Value' and 'Blue Moon' Gain More Popularity Among Voters\n\nWhat’s Coming to Netflix in February 2026\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in February 2026",

Musk, who is Tesla and SpaceX's CEO, launched a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman in February 2024, accusing Altman of jeopardizing its nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said that he contributed $38 million to OpenAI, thinking it would remain a nonprofit. He was one of the company's founders, along with Altman, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and others.\n\nDespite OpenAI's attorneys' attempts to have the case thrown out, a California judge said in a January hearing that there was enough evidence to go to trial, which is set for April.\n\nThe billionaire duo have been trading barbs on social media. Musk attacked OpenAI's ChatGPT on January 20, writing \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT.\" He was responding to an X post alleging that the chatbot has been linked to multiple deaths since 2022.\n\nAltman responded to Musk's post, slamming Tesla's Autopilot system as unsafe, and questioning xAI's Grok chatbot. Grok has faced criticism from governments in several countries after reports of Grok users uploading pictures of women and minors and asking the chatbot to undress them.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Altman did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "App endured a major outage and user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an inquiry by the California governor and an ascendant competitor\n\nA little more than one week ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The app’s time under Chinese ownership had been marked by a meteoric ascent to more than a billion users, which left incumbents such as Instagram looking like the next Myspace. But TikTok’s short new life in the US has been less than auspicious.\n\nThe day after TikTok’s arrival, its owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection, including tracking the precise locations of its users. The change was notable less for any potential invasion of privacy than for suspicion of the new owners. The updated policy falls in line with those of other major social networks. But what did these men, among them billionaire Oracle owner and Maga donor Larry Ellison, intend to do with the user data? The tweaks aroused suspicion that would blossom into paranoia just a few days later.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed the transfer of TikTok’s ownership, the US weathered two major events. A hefty, frigid snowstorm slammed the country and put about 230 million people on alert for power outages and burst pipes. And federal immigration officers killed a 37-year-old US citizen in Minneapolis during a protest, which elicited outright lies from the White House despite copious video footage. Both would knock TikTok off its feet, though in different ways.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on, which the company did not make public at the time. The app suffered severe outages as a result, according to a statement from the company. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings.\n\nSimultaneously, prominent personalities were attempting to use TikTok to express their outrage over the violent death of Alex Pretti at the hands and guns of border patrol agents. They found they could not post videos or that they received zero views. In response, many users – among them California state senator Scott Weiner, musician Billie Eilish and her brother, and comedian Meg Stalter – accused TikTok of stifling videos critical of federal immigration agents. Stalter said she would delete her account, which boasts nearly 280,000 followers. Media outlets far and wide – the New York Times, Variety, the Independent, CNN, the Washington Post – picked up their claims. Cosmopolitan magazine asked: “Is TikTok Censoring Anti-ICE Content?” The Democratic senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, tweeted that TikTok’s alleged censorship was a “threat to democracy”.\n\nAfter days of outcry online, IRL scrutiny and likely dozens of requests for clarification from the press, TikTok issued a statement blaming the problems on the snow, ice and cold on 26 January.\n\nOracle issued a statement with more detail: “Over the weekend, an Oracle datacenter experienced a temporary weather-related power outage which impacted TikTok. The challenges US TikTok users may be experiencing are the result of technical issues that followed the power outage.” It is uncommon for a physical event like a storm to wound a major site of digital life like TikTok, as such popular apps often have backups to their backups, but it can happen.\n\nThe most powerful figure to accuse TikTok of censorship was not its most famous user. The governor of California is better known for his textual presence on X than his TikToks. Nevertheless, Gavin Newsom announced on 27 January that his office would investigate whether TikTok had censored videos critical of Donald Trump, broadening the scope of alleged pro-Maga interference by the app.\n\nThe late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. An unknown number of users said they were decamping from the new American TikTok in response to its perceived censorship. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. An Upscrolled press release now claims more than a million users. As of writing, TikTok rests at No 16 in the iPhone App Store and 10th in the Google Play Store. Alongside Upscrolled in the top 10 most downloaded are three apps used to cloak online activity from surveillance, which are known as virtual private networks (VPNs). A fear of digital government incursions is in the air.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. Facebook and Instagram have withstood far graver scandals than this. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well for its future, though. The app has damaged user trust, and another misstep may inflict a more lasting injury.\n\nTikTok’s week of mayhem began with Trump. The transfer of TikTok’s ownership consummated the ban-or-sell deal the US president proposed nearly six years ago, and he said he was thrilled that that the transfer had finally taken place. In the intervening years, Trump had walked back his support for the deal; his enemy Joe Biden had supported it during his presidency; Congress had passed a law codifying Trump’s wishes and legally forcing TikTok’s sale; and the US supreme court had ratified the law in the face of a challenge by TikTok and immense popular disapproval. Then Trump ordered the immigration crackdown that set the stage for the killing of two US citizens. The only aspect of TikTok’s miserable week Trump had no hand in was the winter weather.\n\nTikTok’s disastrous arrival marks an anniversary of a similar bungled nature. One year and two weeks ago, the app stopped functioning in the US because of the same sell-or-ban law that precipitated the sale. That darkening lasted less than 24 hours. Its new owners can only hope their present problems go away just as soon.",

Coverage of the annual event will begin on ESPN at 6:30 p.m. ET, with the flag game at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nAs the NFL's top talents assemble in the Bay Area this weekend, let's meet the six Lions representatives:\n\nAfter a breakout campaign in his third NFL season out of Iowa, Campbell earned his first Pro Bowl selection and first All-Pro honor.\n\nThe former Hawkeye star led the Lions with 176 tackles (89 solo, 87 assisted), which is the second-most in the league behind Miami's Jordyn Brooks. Campbell also recorded 5 sacks, 4 passes defended, 3 forced fumbles, and 2 fumble recoveries.\n\nCampbell is also the first Lions linebacker to be selected to the Pro Bowl since Stephen Boyd's distinction in 2000.\n\nAppearing in his third Pro Bowl in his third season, Gibbs joins Barry Sanders and Billy Sims as the only running backs in team history to earn at least three Pro Bowl berths in the Super Bowl era.\n\nThis season, the former Crimson Tide icon ranked seventh league-wide in total yards, with 1,223 yards on 243 carries and 13 touchdowns, while catching 77 passes for 616 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nReplacing Seattle's Super Bowl-bound quarterback Sam Darnold, the 2025 Pro Bowl Games Offensive MVP will make his fifth Pro Bowl appearance.\n\nGoff completed 393-of-578 passes to finish second league-wide in yards (4,564) and touchdowns (34).\n\nDespite operating under a new offensive coordinator this season, he became the sixth quarterback in NFL history to produce 4,000 passing yards and 30 touchdowns in three consecutive campaigns.\n\nHutchinson earned the second Pro Bowl selection of his career after setting career highs in sacks, tackles, and forced fumbles, finishing with 14.5 sacks, 54 tackles, 14 tackles for loss, 4 forced fumbles, 3 passes defended, and 1 interception.\n\nHutchinson also led the league with 100 pressures, and his 91.9 overall grade from PFF ranked fourth among edge rushers. He became the first player in franchise history to log multiple 10.0-sack seasons through the first four years of his career.\n\nIn addition to the Pro Bowl nod, Hutchinson was named a finalist for the 2025 Associated Press Comeback Player of the Year and 2025 Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nAppearing in his fourth straight Pro Bowl in his five-year career, Penei Sewell will once again compete in the NFL's premier all-star event.\n\nHis 95.2 overall grade and 96.8 run-block grade from PFF led all offensive linemen this season, which stems from the former Oregon star allowing just one sack and six quarterback hits this year.\n\nSewell was named a finalist for the NFL's inaugural Protector of the Year Award in 2025 and joins Lou Creekmur and Lomas Brown as the only Lions tackles to earn at least four Pro Bowl berths in their career.\n\nSt. Brown, who has positioned himself amongst the NFL's elite wide receivers, earned his fourth straight Pro Bowl selection after recording 117 receptions for 1,401 yards and 11 touchdowns this season.\n\nThis past season, the USC product became the fourth player in NFL history to top 100 receptions and 10 touchdown receptions in three consecutive seasons.\n\nSt. Brown now joins Calvin Johnson and Herman Moore as the only wide receivers in team history to earn at least four Pro Bowl berths.\n\nFor more Lions coverage,  Follow Scout on X: @SpringgateNews\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lions Wire: Which Detroit Lions are participating in the 2026 Pro Bowl?",

    "fullText": "A wave of affordable Chinese-made EVs is accelerating the shift away from petrol cars, challenging long‑held assumptions about how transport decarbonisation unfolds\n\nDon’t get Down to Earth delivered to your inbox? \nLast year, almost every new car sold in Norway, the nature-loving country flush with oil wealth, was fully electric. In prosperous Denmark, which was all-in on petrol and diesel cars until just before Covid, sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) reached a share of 68%. In California, the share of zero-emissions vehicles hit 20%. And at least every third new car now bought by the Dutch, Finns, Belgians and Swedes burns no fuel.\n\nThese figures, which would have felt fanciful just five years ago, show the rich world leading the shift away from cars that pump out toxic gas and planet-heating pollutants. But a more startling trend is that electric car sales are also racing ahead in many developing countries. While China is known for its embrace of electric vehicles (EVs), demand has also soared in emerging markets from South America to south-east Asia. BEV sales in Turkey have caught up with the EU’s, data published this week shows.\n\nIs the electric car revolution finally entering the fast lane? Let’s take a look – after this week’s most important reads.\n\nThe Fukushima towns frozen in time: nature has thrived since the nuclear disaster but what happens if humans return?\n\nThe UK government didn’t want you to see this report on ecosystem collapse. I’m not surprised\n\nThe 16-month battle to reveal the truth about Sydney Water’s poo balls\n\nFor decades, climate progress has largely come from cleaning up the power sector. Burn gas instead of coal, or replace power plants with wind turbines or solar panels, and you can slash the amount of planet-heating gas spewed into the atmosphere for little cost.\n\nNow, early signs suggest transportation may be on the brink of delivering similar wins. EVs have quickly gained ground in markets outside Europe and North America, avoiding a rise in fuel-burning vehicles and “leapfrogging” the development path that richer countries have taken in transport.\n\n“Five years ago you might have thought [transportation] is really going to be a bottleneck [for climate progress],” says William Lamb, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “But now with the widescale adoption of EVs, it’s looking a little bit easier.”\n\nThe EV race has gone global, according to a report (pdf) published last month by Ember, a climate thinktank, which looked at BEV and plug-in hybrid sales for the first 10 months of last year. It found 39 countries around the world have an electric sales share above 10%, up from just four countries (all in Europe) in 2019. Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have overtaken the EU in their EV uptake. India, Mexico and Brazil have overtaken Japan.\n\n“It’s good news that we’re seeing growth in the EV market in more countries now,” said Robbie Andrew, a scientist who tracks electric vehicle sales at Cicero, a research centre in Oslo, the world’s EV capital. “In developing countries, this is largely about the recent arrival of much cheaper models from China. The Chinese companies have innovated extraordinarily quickly.”\n\nHalf of the cars registered in China last year were electric, and carmakers such as BYD have driven the boom in much of the global south. The Ember report found that three of the ten largest-value markets for Chinese EV exports are outside the OECD – Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia – while the value of its exports to non-OECD countries and Mexico has tripled in the last two years.\n\nThe countries that benefit range from Ethiopia, which in 2024 became the first nation to ban imports of combustion engine cars, to Nepal, a polluted country scarred by a blockade 11 years ago that left it with severe petrol shortages. But it is not just the Chinese driving progress. Turkey’s share of BEV sales hit 17% last year – the same as the EU’s – in a transition led by domestic carmaker Togg. It has overtaken Tesla as the country’s leading supplier, with BYD in third place.\n\nThe question of whether to buy an electric vehicle has also been complicated by a culture war surrounding some of the brands that make them. Tesla has seen sales plummet across Europe and the US in response to Elon Musk’s support for far-right parties, and promotion of racist conspiracy theories. But in Turkey, the brand is viewed somewhat more favourably.\n\n“If you have a Togg in Turkey, some people think you are a government-lover and a political Islamist,” says Berke Astarcioğlu, an engineer from Istanbul and an early adopter of EVs. “But if you have a Tesla, you are seen as secular, educated and open-minded.”\n\nA challenge for developing countries seeking to sustain the EV boom is whether they can build charging infrastructure fast enough to avoid customer frustration. About two-thirds of the growth in public chargers since 2020 has occurred in China, which now has about 65% of the global charging stock, a report by the International Energy Agency found last year. But charging infrastructure in many other markets is lagging behind EV adoption rates.\n\nThere are also fears the surge in EVs may taper out as the rich customer base in lower- and middle-income countries is exhausted. New cars are generally bought by wealthier residents, while others buy theirs second-hand.\n\nStill, in places like Turkey and Thailand (to name two of many), where falling prices and rising subsidies bring the price of EVs in line with petrol cars, Andrew says the question of whether only the rich can afford them falls away. “With price parity, people buy the cars because they’re simply better and cost less to run.”\n\nIf that trend continues to spread around the world, we may soon see electric cars leave their fume-belching rivals in the dust.\n\nPowering up: how Ethiopia is becoming an unlikely leader in the electric vehicle revolution\n\n‘My Tesla has become ordinary’: Turkey catches up with EU in electric car sales\n\nThe electric vehicle revolution is still on course – don’t let your loathing of Elon Musk stop you joining up",

    "description": "Sergey Brin, Max Levchin, Eric Schmidt, and others donated $35 million to ballot measure committees in January.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin is one of the many California-based billionaires pouring millions into donations ahead of the state's proposed wealth tax.\n\nBrin, along with other tech executives, venture capitalists, and philanthropists, donated a combined $35 million to ballot measure committees in January, supporting affordable housing ballots in California, per a disclosure seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe disclosure was filed by the coalition \"Building a Better California.\"\n\nBrin was the largest contributor in the filing, donating $20 million. Others donated large sums on various days in January, like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and PayPal CEO Max Levchin, who donated $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\n\nOthers in the list include DoorDash CEO Tony Xu, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, and Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr.\n\nBrin's multimillion-dollar donation comes ahead of California's vote on a measure that would levy a one-time, 5% tax on billionaires in the state. The tax, due in 2027, would be imposed retroactively from January 1 this year.\n\nGroups like the one Brin donated to are part of a concerted push by billionaires to negate the need for the wealth tax, either by funding alternative programs or by funneling money into political action committees opposed to the measure.\n\nReactions to the potential tax have been mixed. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he's \"perfectly fine\" with it, saying this month that Silicon Valley's talent pool was worth any taxes.\n\nHowever, other executives have taken a more defensive stance. Brin and Google's other cofounder, Larry Page, moved an LLC they are both tied to from California to Delaware in December.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said the tax would be \"horrendous\" for innovation. White House AI czar David Sacks said the tax, if enacted, would be akin to an \"asset seizure.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported that Palantir's chairman, Peter Thiel, donated $3 million to the California Business Roundtable in December, which has directly opposed the wealth tax.\n\nRepresentatives for the executives did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Authorities discovered a massive stash of illegal firearms and a secret underground bunker at the base of a 100-foot tunnel on a MAGA activist's property in Northern California.",
    "fullText": "Shasta County authorities started out investigating a suspected illegal marijuana farm but ended up making a far more unsettling discovery: a massive stash of illegal firearms and a secret underground bunker at the base of a 100-foot tunnel on a MAGA activist's property.\n\nMichael Jay Kamfolt, 40, was arrested Jan. 20 after members of the California Highway Patrol discovered the bunker and confiscated an array of illegally possessed weapons — including three AR-15-style assault rifles, a sawed-off shotgun and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition — while serving a search warrant at his Anderson home. He is no longer in custody, according to county records.\n\n“This operation went far beyond an illegal grow,\" CHP Northern Division Chief John Pinoli said in a statement. \"The combination of a hidden bunker and an alarming cache of illegal firearms and ammunition highlights the threat posed to public safety.\"\n\nKamfolt is a well-known conservative activist who had shown up at protests and county Board of Supervisors meetings and had repeatedly raised concerns about voting fraud, according to reports from the Shasta Scout. Shasta County has become a hotbed for hard-right governance and election denialism in the Trump era of American politics, and a staunchly conservative majority took control of the county board in 2022.\n\nKamfolt is a strong advocate of Kevin Crye, a county supervisor and MAGA supporter. Kamfolt described himself as a “good friend” of Crye who would “do anything to help him out,\" while confronting protesters outside of Crye's business in May 2025, according to the Shasta Scout.\n\nCrye is a pro-Trump election denier and survived a recall effort by just 50 votes in March 2024. The effort was launched after he led a successful effort to have the county ditch Dominion voting machines in favor of hand-counting ballots.\n\nIn a Facebook video posted the day after Kamfolt's arrest, Crye said, \"It came to my attention today that a supporter and I'll even say a friend of mine was arrested last night, and my heart is truly broken.\"\n\nCrye said he was caught off guard by the news but urged people \"not to rush to judgment.\" \"Remember we are innocent until proven guilty,\" he said.\n\nThe CHP initially received a December tip about a suspected illegal marijuana grow on Kamfolt's property in Anderson, a small city 10 miles south of Redding.\n\nOfficers then secured a search warrant and conducted a flight over the area. They continued to investigate for a month before searching Kamfolt's property on Dec. 20, when they discovered the bunker equipped with all the supplies necessary to cultivate marijuana including power, ventilation and a concrete floor with built-in drainage.\n\nLocated at the base of a 100-foot water drainage pipe, the sprawling secret cavern also contained a home gym, armchair and television. The wall decor included a Bennington flag, which was among the various historical American flags carried by supporters of President Trump during the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nWhile on the property, officers seized 13 firearms, four soft body armor vests and 30 high-capacity magazines. Two of the guns were reported stolen, one in 2016 and the other in 1978, according to the CHP.\n\nKamfolt was arrested on suspicion of an array of misdemeanor and felony weapons-related violations. They include converting a firearm into a machine gun, manufacturing a ghost gun, possession of a stolen firearm and possession of armor penetrating ammunition.\n\nThe CHP's investigation is ongoing, and so far a case has not been presented to the Shasta County district attorney's office for filing consideration, according to a department spokesperson.\n\nKamfolt was no longer in custody on Monday, according to Shasta County inmate records. The county Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on when he was released.\n\nA.

On Monday it was new defensive line coach Charlie Partridge and analyst Nick Sebastian making the trip.\n\nWhile Toilolo is ranked as the No. 536 overall prospect in the 247Sports Composite, you have to trust Notre Dame’s player evaluations.\n\nThe Irish have done a great job in identifying players who are flying under the radar, and that could be the case with Toilolo. It’s going to be tough to pull him from the West Coast, but if there’s a team that can do it, it’s Notre Dame.\n\nThank you to @NDFootball @CoachPartridge and @NickSebas_ for visiting me at school this afternoon.

    "fullText": "A mother has been arrested after a 19-month-old child was seen flying out of a car while it was making a turn at an intersection in Orange County.\n\nThe Fullerton Police Department issued a statement Monday saying officials there became aware of a video circulating on social media showing the toddler fall out of a black SUV as it turned onto Malvern Avenue from Euclid Street in Fullerton earlier this week.\n\nOfficials clarified that the incident is believed to have occurred between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. on Jan. 20 and that no calls for service were received in relation to the child falling. The same intersection was the site of a crash involving a group of fleeing jewel thieves three days later.\n\n‘Graffiti-proof’ ivy was installed along a busy Los Angeles freeway. It didn’t work so well\n\nIn the footage, which was taken from the dashcam of a vehicle driving the opposite direction, depicts the front passenger side door of the SUV swinging open as it turned left from Malvern onto Euclid.\n\nUpon the child falling out, the SUV stopped abruptly – Fullerton police noted that the driver “nearly caused a traffic collision” with the vehicle behind it – and a woman was seen running from the driver’s side to where the child fell. She picked up the child and returned to the vehicle before the video ended.\n\nFour days later, a witness came forward to police and reported the incident. An investigation was conducted that led to a residence in La Habra, and the SUV, child and woman seen in the video were all located there.\n\n“The female, identified as Jacqueline Hernandez, a 35-year-old resident of La Habra and the child’s mother, was placed under arrest and booked at the Fullerton City Jail for felony child abuse,” Fullerton police stated Monday.\n\n3 men, including 1 who fled to Vietnam, in custody for California teen’s killing; 4th suspect believed to be in Jordan\n\nThe child was said by authorities to have sustained injuries “consistent with the fall” and was hospitalized. They are expected to make a full recovery.\n\nAnyone with information that could aid the ongoing investigation is asked to contact Fullerton Police Department Sensitive Crimes Unit Detective H. Rios: 714-738-6782 or hrios@fullertonpd.org.\n\nTo submit anonymous information, call O.C. Crime Stoppers: 1-855-847-6227.",

Newsom’s accusation on Monday came as a number of users on TikTok reported abnormalities and accused the platform of censoring their posts.\n\nSteve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University’s School of Law, said a video he recorded about reports federal immigration officers could use sweeping power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant had been placed “under review”.\n\nCasey Fiesler, an expert in technology ethics and internet law at the University of Colorado told CNN it was “not surprising that there’s a significant lack of trust” in TikTok’s new ownership. She told the outlet that she had problems uploading videos that alluded to the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nLast week’s TikTok deal was a milestone for the firm after years of battles with the US government over Washington’s concerns about risks to national security and privacy under Trump and former President Joe Biden.\n\nByteDance said TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC would secure US user data, apps and algorithms through data privacy and cybersecurity measures, in a deal praised by Trump.\n\nWith more than 16 million followers on his personal TikTok account, Trump credited the app with helping him win the 2024 election.\n\nThe deal provides for American and global investors to hold 80.1% of the venture while ByteDance will own 19.9%.\n\nEach of the joint venture’s three managing investors, cloud computing giant Oracle, private equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX, will hold a stake of 15%.\n\nThe US and Chinese governments had signed off on the deal, a White House official said.",

    "fullText": "Jan 26 (Reuters) - Attorneys for Meta Platforms and other social media companies asked a California federal judge on Monday to block several school districts from taking their lawsuits against the companies to trial, arguing that federal law protects them from claims they ​knowingly addicted young users.\n\nAt a hearing before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, lawyers for the companies clashed with counsel ‌for six school districts from states across the country, who argue the platforms' design has harmed students' mental health and forced districts to spend money and staff time to address the fallout.\n\nThe companies urged ‌the judge to rule that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally shields platforms like Meta's Facebook and Instagram from liability over user-generated content, bars the cases from proceeding to the first trials in federal court over the claims.\n\nJonathan Blavin, an attorney for the social media companies, said the schools’ allegations rely on evidence that includes such content, placing the claims within the protections of Section 230.\n\n\"If that evidence is entirely excluded, I think the record here is incredibly thin,\" Blavin said. \"It's just ⁠not there.\"\n\nLawyers for the school districts countered that their ‌claims are not based on user-content but on platform features they say are intentionally designed to keep young people on the social media sites as long as possible.\n\nAndre Mura, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said their experts had examined broad studies of ‍students who had used social media to support their findings that it had harmed them.\n\n“The literature shows the increase in the risk of harm is not based on content,” he said.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS IN STATE, FEDERAL COURT\n\nMeta, Snapchat and parent Snap Inc., YouTube and parent Alphabet Inc., and TikTok and parent ByteDance are facing thousands of lawsuits in both federal and ​state court over claims they knowingly designed their platforms to have features that addict children and teens, fueling a mental health crisis.\n\nThe first trial testing ‌the claims in state court is slated for this week in Los Angeles.\n\nThe federal cases have been consolidated into multidistrict litigation before Rogers and include lawsuits brought by families, school districts and state governments.\n\nMonday's hearing focused only on cases filed by school districts, which claim they have been hurt financially from having to manage student mental health issues and social problems like cyberbullying. Rogers is considering whether to enter judgment for the companies in six of those lawsuits, selected as so-called \"bellwether\" or test cases, ahead of the first trials in federal court, currently scheduled to begin in June.\n\nBellwether trials are used to gauge how juries may respond to similar ⁠claims and help establish settlement values for the other similar cases in the litigation.\n\nIn rulings ​on the companies’ motions to dismiss in 2023 and 2024, Rogers said the cases could go ​forward, but Section 230 limited many of their claims, including some about specific features of the platforms.\n\nOn Monday, Rogers agreed that the plaintiffs had a lot of evidence that seemed to be based on content and said that should the cases go forward, there ‍would be a lengthy debate about what ⁠could be shown to the juries.\n\nBut even if the actual content played some role, Rogers said that juries were often asked to examine a problem with several causes and determine which were primarily to blame.\n\n“It’s not like we have a white and a yolk, it’s all scrambled together,” Rogers ⁠said. “That’s a very common circumstance. Why should this be any different?”\n\nThe case is In Re: Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District ‌of California, No. 4:22-md-03047.\n\nFor plaintiffs: Andre Mura of Gibbs Mura; Previn Warren of Motley Rice\n\nFor defendants: Jonathan Blavin of Munger Tolles & Olson; ‌Ashley Hardin of Williams & Connolly; Christian Pistilli of Covington & Burling",

    "description": "California has hailed itself as a leader in single-use plastic reduction and legislation. But a scuttling of its pioneering law, and a new report on the dismal state of recycling in the state, shows things aren't so green in the Golden State.",
    "fullText": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nCalifornia touts itself as a leader on the problem of plastic garbage, but recent developments suggest otherwise.\n\nA new report issued by the state’s waste agency shows plastic yogurt containers, shampoo bottles and restaurant takeout trays are being recycled at rates only in the single digits.\n\nPolypropylene, labeled as #5 on packaging, is used for yogurt containers, margarine tubs and microwavable trays. Only 2% of it is getting recycled. Colored shampoo and detergent bottles, made from polyethylene, or #1 plastic, are getting recycled at a rate of just 5%.\n\nOther plastics, including ones promoted as highly recyclable, such as clear polyethylene bottles, which hold some medications, or hard water bottles, are being recycled at just 16%.\n\nNo plastic in the report exceeds a recycling rate of 23%, with the majority reported in just the single digits.\n\nAdding to this disquieting assessment, CalRecycle also just pulled back regulations that were supposed to finalize a landmark single-use plastic law known as Senate Bill 54 — a law designed to make the majority of packaging waste in the state recyclable or compostable by working with the plastic and packaging industries.\n\nThe report and delay have sparked a wide variety of reactions by those who have closely watched the law as it was written and implemented.\n\nThe proposed regulations were regarded as friendly to industry. As a result, some are hopeful that CalRecycle’s decision to pull them back for tweaking means the agency will make the law stronger. Others say the two developments just show the state has never really been serious about plastic recycling.\n\n“California’s SB 54 ... will NEVER increase the recycling rates of these items ... because cartons and plastic packaging are fundamentally not technically or economically recyclable,” said Jan Dell, the founder of Orange County-based Last Beach Cleanup, an anti-plastic organization.\n\nIndustry representatives are also expressing disappointment, saying the more delays and changes the state makes, the harder it is “for California businesses to comply with the law and implement the resulting changes,” said John Myers, a spokesman for the California Chamber of Commerce, which represents companies that will be affected.\n\nReports on abysmally low rates of recycling for milk cartons and polystyrene have been widely shared and known. But the newest numbers were still a grim confirmation that there are few options for dealing with these materials.\n\nAccording to one state analysis, 2.9 million tons of single-use plastic and 171.4 billion single-use plastic components were sold, offered for sale or distributed in California in 2023.\n\nSingle-use plastics and plastic waste more broadly are considered a growing environmental and health problem. In recent decades, plastic waste has overwhelmed waterways and oceans, sickening marine life and threatening human health.\n\nLast spring, the Newsom administration was accused of neutering the regulations that CalRecycle had initially proposed to implement the law. The changes excluded all packaging material related to produce, meat, dairy products, dog food, toothpaste, condoms, shampoo and cereal boxes, among other products. These are all products that might fall under the purview of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nIt also opened the door to “alternative” recycling, such as chemical recycling, which environmentalists say is polluting, and was banned in the language of the law.\n\nThe waste agency then submitted those draft regulations to the Office of Administrative Law, whose lawyers and staff review proposed regulations to ensure they are “clear, necessary, legally valid, and available to the public” before finalizing them. They were set to release their determination on Friday; CalRecycle pulled the regulations back before the office issued its determination.\n\nNeither the law office nor governor’s office responded to requests for comment.\n\nMelanie Turner, CalRecycle’s spokeswoman, said the agency withdrew its proposed regulations “to make changes ... to improve clarity and support successful implementation of the law,” and its revisions were focused on areas that dealt with “food and agricultural commodities.”\n\nCalifornia state Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), author of the original legislation, called the delay “entirely avoidable” in a statement, but said it would allow CalRecycle an “opportunity to ensure the regulations truly follow the law as it was signed.”\n\nHe urged the waste agency and Newsom’s administration not to “allow broad, sweeping exemptions that would undermine the program and increase costs for ratepayers.”\n\nCritics of the watered-down regulations, such as Anja Brandon, the director of plastics policy for the Ocean Conservancy, said she wasn’t surprised by the withdrawal.\n\nThe proposed regulations “would have gone beyond CalRecycle’s authority by creating a sweeping categorical exclusion for food and agricultural packaging — effectively a loophole that would have allowed producers to continue putting vast amounts of plastic packaging into the marketplace, completely undermining SB 54’s goals and success,” she said in a text message.\n\nTurner said CalRecycle will conduct a 15-day comment period — although when that begins has not yet been divulged.",

    "fullText": "World number one Scottie Scheffler launched his 2026 US PGA Tour campaign with a runaway victory in the American Express at La Quinta, California.\n\nScheffler, whose 2025 season included two major titles among six victories, piled up nine birdies in a six-under par 66 on the Stadium Course, where even a double-bogey at the 17th was barely a blip on the way to a 27-under par total of 261 and a four-shot victory.\n\nAustralian veteran Jason Day climbed into a share of second with a superb eight-under par 64. He was joined on 265 by Americans Ryan Gerard, Matt McCarty and Andrew Putnam, Gerard posting a seven-under 65 and McCarty and Putnam each signing for a 68.\n\nScheffler, 29, became the first player since Tiger Woods to grab his 20th US PGA Tour title before the age of 30. He's off to his fifth straight season with at least one victory.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" Scheffler said. \"It was a challenging week. I did a good job of staying patient and executing when I needed to.\"\n\nScheffler, who hasn't missed a cut on the PGA Tour since August 2022, started the day one off the lead and opened with a birdie. He bogeyed the second before settling in with back-to-back birdies at four and five and another pair at seven and eight.\n\nHe added four more birdies coming in, his four-footer at the par-five 16th pushing him to 29-under.\n\nHe was in the water off the tee on the way to a double-bogey at the par-three 17th, but by then there was no catching him.\n\nOvernight leader Kim Si-woo of South Korea carded an even par 72 to tie for sixth on 22-under.\n\nTeenager Blades Brown, who started the day tied with Scheffler on 21-under, closed with a two-over 74 for a share of 18th.\n\nIt finished off a remarkable week for the 18-year-old from Tennessee, who tied for 17th in a Korn Ferry event in the Bahamas on Wednesday before a dash to California to tee it up on a sponsor's exemption.\n\nHe flirted with a 59 on Friday, when a 60 gave him a share of the halfway lead. He had a birdie chance at 18 for a share of 10th -- and a place in the Torrey Pines field.\n\nHe closed with a bogey but departed happy with his week.\n\n\"I could probably write a book about what I've learned these past couple of days,\" Brown said.\n\n\"Just knowing that I can compete out here. It was so cool watching Scottie win in person and getting to play with him.\n\n\"He's such an unbelievable guy. He talked to me numerous times throughout the round and was giving me a lot of encouragement, so it was awesome.\"",

    "fullText": "Blades Brown has turned heads at the American Express in La Quinta, California this week, with a level of play that’s hard to ignore.\n\nThe 18-year-old fired a remarkable 12-under-par 60 on Friday at the American Express, putting himself right in the mix and catching plenty of attention.\n\nNow into his tenth appearance on tour, Brown has settled in quickly. He doesn’t look out of place at all among the regulars.\n\nThe final round will see him tee it up alongside Scottie Scheffler and Si Woo Kim—a massive opportunity for the teenager to test himself against established names.\n\nHe’s also shown plenty of composure throughout the week, playing smart and staying patient when things weren’t falling his way early on. That kind of maturity is rare for someone so new to this level.\n\nIf he can pull it off, he’ll become the youngest PGA Tour winner since Charles Kocsis won the 1931 Michigan Open—a remarkable feat for any player, let alone one still new to life on tour.\n\nJustin Rose has had a remarkable career, and his list of achievements speaks for itself.\n\nHis US Open title, Olympic gold medal, 26 professional wins, and seven Ryder Cup appearances highlight an impressive resume.\n\nThe 45-year-old has managed to stay relevant at the top level of the game for a long time, which is no small feat.\n\nBut his early days in professional golf were far from easy.\n\nAfter turning pro in 1998, he missed 21 straight cuts and struggled to find his footing on tour.\n\nRose made the leap into the pro ranks right after finishing T-4 at The Open Championship at Royal Birkdale in 1998.\n\nThat memorable hole-out on the final green is still fresh in many minds.\n\nRose began that Sunday fifth on the leaderboard and climbed to fourth with a strong round of 69 in very tough conditions.\n\nAfter shooting a 68 in Saturday’s third round of the American Express, Blades Brown finished the day tied for second and matched a 28-year PGA Tour record originally set by Justin Rose.\n\nHe’s now the first player aged 18 or younger to be inside the top five after three rounds of a PGA Tour event since Rose did it at The Open in 1998.\n\nJustin Ray, who is known for his detailed golf stats, shared this information on his official X account:\n\nBrown’s run at the American Express has been nothing short of remarkable.\n\nMatching a record that Justin Rose set nearly three decades ago really shows how well he’s played this week.",

    "description": "A millionaire in California shares why he supports the state's proposed billionaire wealth tax — and why he doesn't plan to move away.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Scott Ellis, a 55-year-old millionaire who lives in Silicon Valley, about California's proposed 5% billionaire wealth tax. Ellis is a member of Patriotic Millionaires, a collection of wealthy Americans who advocate for a fair tax system, a livable wage, and equal access to political power. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI never thought I'd live in California. I grew up in Colorado, went to college in Boston, and lived in Texas. I came out here for business school because I wanted to be at Stanford, and because you could play golf during the winter.\n\nNow I love it here. It has nothing to do with taxes; taxes have never been anywhere on our list of criteria for deciding where to live. I want to live where my family is and love the weather, the jobs, and the dynamism.\n\nTaxes are the price that we pay to live in a civil society. We have to do this together. There are examples all around the world of the power of effective government, and just like anything else, government needs to be funded. We should make it effective and efficient.\n\nI'm proud to pay the taxes I pay. I should pay taxes that are higher than other people because I have more wealth than other people — that makes sense.\n\nA lot of our financial success has been due to my wife's success, as well as mine at the beginning of our careers.\n\nI went to Harvard undergrad, worked at McKinsey for three years, and then went to Stanford. I then worked at Hewlett-Packard for almost eight years.\n\nIn 2007, my wife was a VP at Yahoo and we had two small kids. I looked at my boss's job, and at the CEO's job, and decided I didn't ever want those roles. I thought, \"Uh-oh, I'm on this ladder, and it's not really where I want to go.\"\n\nUltimately, my wife and I decided that I would step back and be the stay-at-home parent. My wife continued her career, and she's been very successful in consumer internet at Yahoo, Google, and Pinterest.\n\nI studied poverty, urban America, housing, transportation, and sociology in college, and started thinking more about questions like: What does fairness look like? What does justice look like? What would it look like to build a great society?\n\nI got busy pursuing my career, meeting my wife, and raising our kids, but as time passed and we progressed in our careers, I got back into thinking about how we help others around us. I did a bunch of volunteer work in different contexts, eventually becoming the COO and then the CSO of a nonprofit called New Teacher Center, which does intensive mentoring programs for new teachers.\n\nSince 2012, I've started and run several nonprofits in the education space, and advised almost 200 individuals and organizations on things like strategy, finance, operations, and culture.\n\nI'm also really focused on addressing excessive wealth and its impact on society and thinking about a future vision for American democracy, which is how I came to Patriotic Millionaires, an organization of wealthy Americans who advocate for higher taxes on wealthy people like ourselves, a higher minimum wage, and a broader distribution of political power across our society.\n\nIn recent years, I've been struck by the massive accumulation of wealth enabled by the consumer internet space, globalization, and the structure of the finance industry. It's different from what it used to be in the '80s and '90s; this is a whole new ballgame.\n\nMore recently, I've been looking around Silicon Valley at all these people who are so incredibly wealthy, talented, and successful, and realizing how few of them are thinking about choosing to build a better society together.\n\nThey're excited about starting new companies and raising new funds, but these are all people who have more money than they could ever spend, and their next goal is to generate even more money, mainly for people who already have more money than they could ever spend.\n\nMeanwhile, 10% of our society is in poverty. It really feels unfair and wrong, and we can do better.\n\nThe proposed billionaire wealth tax in California doesn't impact me and my family directly. People may think, \"You're happy to raise taxes on other people.\"\n\nBut we need to start with a different conversation, about how much wealth is enough, how much wealth is too much, and what is financial success?\n\nI believe that if you have $30 million in wealth, congratulations, you won capitalism. If you do the analysis of reasonable investment returns and inflation, you can buy a really nice first house, a nice second house, your kids' college is paid for, your end-of-life expenses are covered, and you have a very, very luxurious ongoing existence.\n\nSo much of success in life is luck. Yes, people absolutely get educated and work hard. But it's been found that the wealthier people are, the more they tend to attribute their wealth to how good they are and how hard they worked.\n\nI look at single moms working three jobs, working the night shift — a heck of a lot of people who have less than $190,000 [the median household wealth] in wealth are working very hard.\n\nOnce you get beyond $30 million — and almost no one ever gets there — you get to a point where your life is so good, you really can't materially improve your life anymore. We should implement a very aggressive annual 50% tax on all household wealth over $30 million. Excessive wealth turns into excessive power through huge campaign donations, which threatens and undermines democracy and capitalism.\n\nI'm absolutely delighted that we're moving in this direction, but I believe changes to wealth taxes need to happen at the federal level.\n\nWhen wealthy folks bring up moving out of California, it's a distraction. All of a sudden, instead of us talking about the fact that millions of people are going to be either losing healthcare or paying much more for healthcare, we're worried about the 200 really rich people who might move.\n\nPeople move all the time. Companies move all the time for all kinds of reasons — it's just part of business. These conversations happen all the time — like, \"Oh my gosh, there won't be any more companies in Silicon Valley.\" Well, 20 years later, look around. There are still some companies here; it's just fine.\n\nIt's 65 degrees and sunny here. The CEO of Nvidia recently said they'll be staying in California because that's where the talent is. We've got the Golden Gate Bridge, Hollywood, Tahoe, the Redwoods, the beach, and great weather. I'm really not worried that people aren't going to want to live in California.\n\nI love it here. My wife and I are thinking about living in different cities for maybe a month at a time, but I have no plans to go anywhere else. Although I definitely love Colorado — I still have my Denver Broncos coasters and will be cheering for my Broncos — I'm from Silicon Valley now, and that's where I'm going to stay.",

    "fullText": "A hiker has been found dead after attempting to climb Mount Whitney in California despite their companion turning back\n\nAt around 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, “while near the 12,500-foot elevation, one hiker determined it was safest to turn around and descend,\" per a release from a local search & rescue group, though the second hiker continued on and ultimately died\n\n“After a thorough search, the subject was located on the north face of Mount Whitney, below the “Final 400” on the Mountaineers Route, and was confirmed deceased,” officials said. They did not reveal the person's identity\n\nA hiker has been found dead after attempting to climb Mount Whitney in California despite their companion turning back.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jan. 21, the Inyo County Search & Rescue confirmed in a post on Facebook that they received a report about a missing hiker on Monday.\n\nOfficials said the individual began hiking with another person at around 11:30 p.m. on Saturday and into the next day.\n\nHowever, at around 3:30 p.m. local time on Sunday, “while near the 12,500-foot elevation, one hiker determined it was safest to turn around and descend.”\n\n“The second hiker continued ascending toward the summit,” the release read. “When the second hiker failed to return by the following morning, the reporting party contacted the Inyo County Sheriff’s Office, and a SAR response was initiated.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe rescue operation involved a team of six rescuers and the California Highway Patrol Inland Division helicopter (H-82), which departed from Lone Pine.\n\nWhen the helicopter arrived at Mount Whitney at around 2:00 p.m., a “rescuer was inserted with the flight crew to conduct an aerial search.”\n\n“After a thorough search, the subject was located on the north face of Mount Whitney, below the “Final 400” on the Mountaineers Route, and was confirmed deceased,” officials said. They did not reveal the person's identity.\n\nThe rescuers then returned to Lone Pine just before 6:00 p.m.\n\n“The incident occurred within Tulare County jurisdiction, and proper notification was made to the Tulare County Sheriff's Office,” Inyo County Search & Rescue continued.\n\nThe news comes after the body of a missing 21-year-old hiker was recovered on Mount Whitney, Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nPEOPLE also previously reported that a father of two died after falling from a trail while climbing Mount Whitney in October.\n\nIn their recent statement, the Inyo County Search & Rescue said the “recent fatalities on Mount Whitney and Mount Baldy, serves as a reminder that winter ascents are serious mountaineering endeavors, not hikes.”\n\n“Winter conditions leave little margin for error, and the consequences can be severe,” they added. “Additionally, many fatalities occur when individuals travel solo or when groups separate.”\n\nThey went on to say that the safety concerns of a person in a group “ should be taken seriously.”\n\n“Fatigue is also a critical contributing factor,” they added. “Extended periods of exertion negatively impact decision-making and increase the likelihood of missteps and falls. Knowing when to turn around can save lives.\"\n\nThe statement from rescuers concluded, “Please be respectful in your comments. The victim’s family and friends may be following this post, and some comments may be hurtful. Thank you!”\n\nMount Whitney is the tallest mountain in the contiguous U.S., according to the National Park Service’s website. The elevation at the summit is reported to be 14,505 feet.",

    "fullText": "Teenager Blades Brown fired a spectacular 12-under par 60 to join world number one Scottie Scheffler atop the leaderboard after two rounds of the PGA Tour American Express in La Quinta, California, on Friday.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Tennessee just missed out on a 59 when his birdie putt at his final hole slipped by on the right side.\n\n\"I'm so stoked to have shot 60 on the PGA Tour,\" Brown said, acknowledging that nerves \"absolutely\" kicked in over the final three holes.\n\nHe had made a dazzling start on the Nicklaus Tournament course, one of three in use over the first three rounds of the event.\n\nBrown, who made his pro debut at La Quinta last year, teed off on 10 and was eight under through his first seven holes thanks to an eagle and six birdies.\n\nAfter a birdie at the second he strung together three more at the fourth, fifth and sixth to reach 12-under for the day.\n\nHe couldn't capitalize on the par-five seventh, settling for a par after his second shot found the rough.\n\nAfter a par at the eighth he had one more chance at the 16th sub-60 round ever on the PGA Tour at the par-four ninth, where a mammoth drive and a crisp wedge left him a birdie look from inside seven feet that he couldn't convert.\n\n\"I saw my spot just a little before the hole,\" he said. \"I got a great read off David Ford. He dripped it in there and it went right dead center. So I was thinking, OK, maybe just a little outside right edge.\n\n\"Unfortunately it didn't go in, but I'm really happy with the outcome I had today.\"\n\nIt was the continuation of a whirlwind week for Brown, who finished tied for 17th in the Korn Ferry developmental tour event in the Bahamas on Wednesday, then, with a sponsor's exemption to play in La Quinta, made his way to California in time to tee it up on Thursday.\n\nHe goes into the weekend tied on 17-under 127 with Scheffler, who had eight birdies in his eight-under 64 on the Nicklaus Tournament course.\n\nScheffler is making his season debut after a 2025 campaign that included two major titles among his six wins.\n\nThrilled to have his name next to Scheffler's atop the leaderboard, Brown wasn't getting ahead of himself.\n\n\"We're halfway there. We've got a lot of golf to go,\" he said, adding that his next order of business would be getting some rest.\n\n\"I'm going to go take a nap,\" Brown said.\n\nThe leading duo were one stroke clear of South Korean Kim Si-Woo, who posted a 65 on the tougher Stadium Course for a 16-under total of 128.\n\nIt was a further stroke back to South Korea's Kim Seong-hyeon and American Matt McCarty.\n\nAmerican Andrew Putnam also flirted with a 59 before settling for a 12-under 60 on the La Quinta course that left him 12-under for the tournament.",

    "description": "Ryan Wedding turned himself in at US consulate in Mexico City and is due to appear in court in California on Monday",
    "fullText": "Ryan Wedding, the Canadian Olympic snowboarder turned alleged drug kingpin, has been arrested after turning himself in at the US embassy in Mexico, law enforcement officials announced on Friday.\n\nWedding, 44, had been sought by the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for his role in overseeing what the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, called the “one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations” in the world.\n\n“He thought he could evade justice … here we are today, bringing him to justice,” the FBI director, Kash Patel, said from an airfield in California, calling Wedding the “largest narco-trafficker in modern times”.\n\nMexico’s security minister, Omar García Harfuch, said that Wedding “surrendered voluntarily” at the US embassy in Mexico City on Wednesday after evading police for nearly a decade.\n\nWedding was flown from Mexico to California and is custody. He is due to appear in court on Monday in California. He is charged with drug trafficking, conspiracy to murder, witness tampering and money laundering.\n\nOfficials in the US allege that Wedding’s organisation had moved nearly 60 metric tons of cocaine a year into Los Angeles from Mexico using a network of semitrucks. Wedding is also accused of ordering the killing of a key FBI witness as well as several other murders, including that of a couple who were killed in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nSince 2023, the RCMP and the FBI have been collaborating on a sprawling investigation known as Operation Giant Slalom. In March, 2025, Wedding was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted List.\n\n“We told you in November we would find Mr Wedding. Today, that day has arrived,” said Akil Davis, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office. “The long arm of the law extends beyond our border.”\n\nDavid said the arrest was a “good day” for victims. “Ryan Wedding tormented several people and several families that will never be the same,” he said. “But today, they get the justice that they sought.”\n\nDavis said in addition to “crushing sanctions” against 19 people, including Wedding, authorities also seized a Mercedes sports car worth $15m and motorcycles worth $40m.\n\nUS authorities had previously said that they believed Wedding to be in hiding in Mexico. On Thursday, Patel was in Mexico City for what he called “pre-planned” meetings with the country’s security chief, García Harfuch. And on Friday morning he left with a souvenir: Ryan Wedding, and another, unnamed, “priority objective”.\n\nThe decision for an FBI director to be present in the field for an arrest is exceedingly rare and speaks to the political focus on capturing Wedding.\n\nGarcía Harfuch released a statement saying that Patel was leaving with “a non-US citizen who was arrested by Mexican authorities and is among the FBI’s 10 most wanted, and a Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered yesterday at the US embassy”.\n\n“If it’s true that he handed himself in, this may be an attempt to negotiate better terms,” said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, an analyst with the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime. “Maybe it gives him a little more room for manoeuvre.”\n\nOr there could be another explanation: he feared for his safety in Mexico, said Farfán-Méndez.\n\nThe arrest comes at a time of tension in North America, with Mark Carney and Donald Trump clashing at Davos, and renewed threats of US military strikes on Mexican cartel targets.\n\n“There was a message from the secretary of state, talking about the need for tangible results [against organised crime],” said Farfán-Méndez. “I think grabbing Ryan Wedding is a very media-friendly way to show tangible results. I think it could be filed under that column.”\n\nAlejandro Rosales Castillo, one of the FBI’s 10 most wanted fugitives, who is accused of the murder of a woman in North Carolina in 2016, was also arrested. A US citizen, he crossed the border to Mexico in 2017 and was in hiding for almost a decade until he was captured in Pachuca, Hidalgo, on 16 January.\n\nNBC News first announced news of the arrest and US law enforcement officials familiar with the operation confirmed it to the Guardian.\n\nIn March, the FBI announced a $15m reward for the capture of Wedding, whose nicknames include “Public Enemy”, “El Jefe” and “Giant”.\n\nAt the time,Patel, compared Wedding to Pablo Escobar and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.\n\nThe head of the RCMP, Michael Duheme was also present at the announcement and said “no single country” can break up transnational drug-trafficking organizations.\n\nWedding was allegedly being protected by the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico while he was on the run.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that Wedding’s significance in the international drug trade had been exaggerated by US authorities and the media.\n\n“There’s been a high-level characterisation of Wedding as a major kingpin. There was a $15m reward for him. At least from a media standpoint, he was a big fish,” said Farfán-Méndez. “But I think the indictment gives a different sense of proportion.”\n\nThough US authorities claim Wedding’s enterprise was trafficking 60 tonnes of cocaine a year, this figure does not appear in the indictment, which only mentions specific cases of a few hundred kilos being moved at a time.\n\n“These arrests are important for law enforcement,” said Farfán-Méndez. “But whether they impact [drug] supply is another question.”",

    "description": "The company is also currently facing a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in California for deceptive marketing about Autopilot's capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Tesla has discontinued Autopilot, its basic driver-assistance system, as the company tries to boost adoption of a more advanced version of the technology that it calls Full Self-Driving (Supervised).\n\nThe decision comes as the company faces a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in its largest U.S. market, California. A judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD for years. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which originally brought the case and has a say over the licenses, stayed the ruling for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply by dropping the Autopilot name.\n\nAutopilot was a combination of Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which sticks to a designated speed while maintaining distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a lane-centering feature that could steer the car around curves.\n\nTesla’s online configuration site now states new cars now come standard with only Traffic Aware Cruise Control. It’s not clear if current customers are affected.\n\nThe decision comes one week after the company said that starting on February 14, it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software. After that, customers will only be able to access FSD through a monthly subscription of $99 — though Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a post on Thursday that the subscription price will increase as the software’s capabilities improve.\n\nMusk believes that Tesla’s newer cars will be capable of “unsupervised” driving, saying FSD advances will allow drivers to “be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride.” In December, he said a new version of FSD allowed the former, though texting while driving is illegal in almost all states.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla rolled out the first robotaxi versions of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, that have no human safety personnel in the cars. Those vehicles are running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software and are still followed by the company’s cars for supervision.\n\nTesla launched the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software in late 2020, but adoption has always lagged behind the expectations of executives like Musk. In October 2025, Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said only 12% of all Tesla customers had paid for the software. Hitting “10 million active FSD subscriptions” by 2035 is one of the key “product goals” required for Musk to receive the full payout of his new $1 trillion pay package. \n\nTesla first introduced Autopilot in the early 2010s after talks broke down between Musk and Google to leverage the tech being developed by the search giant’s then-nascent autonomous driving division (which eventually got spun out into Waymo). Tesla made the driver-assistance system standard on all of its vehicles in April 2019.\n\nAcross the decade-plus of Autopilot’s existence, Tesla struggled with communicating the software’s capabilities. The company often overpromised and made the tech seem more capable than it was, leading some drivers to become overly confident in its abilities, which in turn led to hundreds of crashes and at least 13 fatalities, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump lashed out at Gavin Newsom for spoiling his appearance at the Davos, Switzerland, summit this week.\n\nThe California governor attended the forum, spending his time criticizing the president and his administration while urging allies to “stand united.” At one point, the 58-year-old claimed he was denied entry into the U.S. hub.\n\nNewsom looked on as Trump addressed political and business leaders on Wednesday, then criticized the president’s “boring, and at times boorish,” speech.\n\n“It was insignificant in its insignificance. He said what we all knew: that he’s not going to invade Greenland,” he told The Guardian.\n\nTrump, who has backed down from his threat of military invasion and tariffs on other European nations, still couldn’t seem to get over Newsom’s appearance.\n\n“Gavin Newscum, as a “Lame Duck” Governor of a Failing State, should not be at Davos running around screaming for the attention of Foreign Leaders, and embarrassing our Country,“ Trump, 79, grumbled on Truth Social. “He made a mockery of himself, and everybody, including his staff, knows it!”\n\nTrump went on to attack the governor, who is term-limited and cannot run for re-election in 2028, on California-specific issues.\n\n“With a record like he’s got,” Trump concluded, “the ruination of one of the most beautiful places on Earth, where people are leaving in droves, it is unimaginable that he could run for President but, who knows, it’s a very strange World!”\n\nNewsom, 58, responded succinctly to Trump’s 158-word attack.\n\nNewsom also took shots at Trump’s backers who followed the president’s lead in criticizing him.\n\nWhen radio host Bill Mitchell captioned a photo of Newsom, “That look you have when you’re not winning and you know it,” the Democrat fired back: “That look when every MAGA doormat can’t stop talking about you.”\n\nIt was only a matter of time before White House Communications Director Steven Cheung got involved.\n\nCheung, who recently went after Newsom for criticizing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and world leaders at Davos who suck up to Trump, gave his own caption of Newsom’s photo.\n\n“The look of someone who realizes they’re at the point of no return and giving up control to others is the only way to satisfy his home life,” he wrote on X.\n\nThe Newsom bashing continued into the night on Fox News.\n\nWhile Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick did some pearl-clutching about Newsom selling kneepads with Trump’s signature, Katie Miller, the wife of Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, suggested that there was a large amount of voting and welfare fraud happening in his state, and complained that Newsom “still hasn’t turned over his voter rolls or welfare list to us.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted Newsom’s office and the White House for comment.\n\nPreviously, the White House told the Daily Beast, “No one in Davos knows who third-rate governor Newscum is or why he is frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.”",

    "description": "At Davos, the California governor criticized Trump, was blocked from the US pavilion, traded insults, waved kneepads, and fueled 2028 speculation.",
    "fullText": "Gavin Newsom's return to Davos was always going to be loud. It just wasn't clear how chaotic it would get.\n\nOver the course of a few days in the Swiss Alps, the California governor criticized President Donald Trump, was denied entry to the USA House, waved red kneepads at corporate leaders, and traded insults with Trump's Treasury secretary.\n\nNewsom had framed his attendance at the World Economic Forum as a direct challenge to Trump on the global stage.\n\nLast week, his office said he planned to rebut the president's economic agenda, defend \"democratic capitalism,\" and position California as a counterweight to what he called Trump's \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nTrump spoke first, addressing business and political leaders on Wednesday morning. Newsom, watching from the room, criticized the speech shortly afterward.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, including Business Insider's Ben Bergman, Newsom said the audience reaction was muted because Trump spoke down to people, adding that \"had there not been cellphones, I think a few people would have passed out from boredom.\"\n\nAnna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, later dismissed Newsom as a \"third-rate governor\" in comments to Business Insider, saying that it was unclear why he was \"frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.\"\n\nTensions escalated hours later on Wednesday when Newsom was denied entry to the USA House, the official US pavilion at Davos, where he was scheduled to talk in a fireside chat hosted by Fortune.\n\nNewsom's office said the invitation was rescinded at the last minute due to pressure from the White House and State Department.\n\nNewsom blasted the move on X, calling it \"weak and pathetic\" to block a fireside chat. His office said that multiple Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, had spoken at the pavilion earlier that day.\n\nBessent, for his part, didn't hold back. He publicly called Newsom \"economically illiterate,\" \"smug,\" and \"too self-absorbed,\" escalating what had already become a personal feud playing out in front of the global business elite.\n\nNewsom got his biggest moment on Thursday during another scheduled Davos appearance.\n\nIn an onstage interview with Semafor's Ben Smith, he said that the US was no longer governed by the rule of law but by what he called \"the rule of Don,\" accusing Congress, universities, law firms, and corporate leaders of bending the knee to the president.\n\nTo make the point, Newsom brought in bright red kneepads — a prop meant to symbolize corporate capitulation — drawing applause from the audience.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, acknowledged Newsom in his own Davos remarks on Wednesday. \"We're going to help the people in California,\" Trump said. \"We want to have no crime. I know Gavin was here. I used to get along so great with Gavin when I was president. Gavin is a good guy.\"\n\nThe governor declined a later invitation to return to the USA House for a private nightcap reception.\n\nPolitical experts told Business Insider that Newsom's return to Davos signals ambitions beyond California.\n\nHis decision to confront Trump in front of global business and political leaders has renewed speculation that he is laying the groundwork for a potential 2028 presidential bid.",

Ted Cruz (R-TX) pushed back on critics pouncing on him over an image of the senator on a plane to California just days before Texas is set to get hit with a major winter storm.\n\n“Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was spotted earlier today, January 20, 2026, on a plane heading to Laguna Beach as the state of Texas braces for a rare ice threat and arctic cold front,” political strategist Shea Jordan Smith wrote on X this week.\n\nIncluded was an image of Cruz on his flight. The post itself has more than eight million views as of Thursday.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was spotted earlier today, January 20, 2026, on a plane heading to Laguna Beach as the state of Texas braces for a rare ice threat and arctic cold front. pic.twitter.com/lVTcqP8LR4\n\n— Shea Jordan Smith (@shea_jordan) January 21, 2026\n\nCruz’s office later put out a statement, dismissing criticism and explaining that Cruz was on a pre-planned trip and he’ll actually be returning to the Lone Star State before the storm is projected to hit.\n\n“Senator Cruz is currently on pre-planned work travel that was scheduled weeks in advance. He will be back in Texas before the storm is projected to hit,” a spokesperson for the senator said in a statement, first shared with KHOU.\n\nMultiple critics invoked another moment from Cruz’s career where he went viral and earned plenty of mockery. In February 2021, Cruz was heavily criticized after took a trip to Cancun, Mexico, while Texas was hit with the deadly Winter Storm Uri.\n\nThe senator returned to Texas at the time and admitted his trip was “obviously a mistake.”\n\n“It was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it,” he said.\n\nThe latest storm is expected to stretch across 2,000 miles eventually, while it’ll begin in Texas and Oklahoma. Heavy snowfall and freezing rain are expected to begin Friday, hitting northern Texas and cities like Dallas and Houston. The storm will eventually move its way to the East Coast.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott (R) has declared a state of emergency in his state over the approaching harsh weather.\n\n“Based on current forecasts, the State of Texas is acting to ensure Texans have the resources they need before severe winter weather impacts communities across Texas,” the governor announced this week. “I thank emergency management personnel and first responders for working tirelessly to keep Texans safe.”\n\nThe post Ted Cruz Bites Back at Critics Furious Over His Leaving Texas Ahead of Major Winter Storm first appeared on Mediaite.",

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nThe Suns entered Wednesday’s matchup coming off a 113-108 loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors on Monday. With rookies Rasheer Fleming and Khaman Maluach, along with two-way player Jamaree Bouyea, assigned back to the team, the Valley hoped the trio would provide the spark needed to get back on track.\n\nFleming and Maluach had been traveling with the Phoenix Suns throughout the six-game road trip, earning minutes whenever the team needed them. Bouyea is coming off concussion protocol and has not played since early January.\n\nHowever, Wednesday’s game allowed the rookies to flourish with increased playing time.\n\nOct 24, 2025; Inglewood, California, USA; Los Angeles Clippers center Yanic Konan Niederhauser (14) defends Phoenix Suns center Khaman Maluach (10) in the second half at Intuit Dome. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images\n\nIn the first half alone, Fleming posted 13 points, three rebounds and two steals. Maluach added eight points and six rebounds but dealt with foul trouble, picking up three fouls before halftime. Bouyea struggled early but found a rhythm late in the half, finishing with nine points, two rebounds, and two assists at the break.\n\nDespite limited minutes, Bouyea’s strong finish to the first half suggested he was simply shaking off rust.\n\nThe Suns opened the second half on an 18-0 run, partly by Bouyea’s eight points. He finished the night with 27 points, while Fleming finished with 19 points and Maluach finished with 23.\n\nNov 24, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Rasheer Fleming (20) against the Houston Rockets at Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nThe trio put up great numbers, as their fatigue from travel didn’t last long. Head coach Paul Jesperson acknowledged their earlier game struggles, especially Bouyea, as Wednesday was his first official night in a Valley Suns uniform.\n\n“We knew there was probably going to be a little fatigue there and a little bit of those guys just having to feel the game out a little bit as it progressed,” he said post-game. “I think [Bouyea] did exactly that. Kind of found his spots, got comfort level [and] got a little energy to him.”\n\nThe Suns finish out the week with a matchup against the Texas Legends on the road on Friday, Jan. 23, at 6:30 p.m.\n\nWM Phoenix Open brings golf to streetwear with Samba shoe collab",

But in messages obtained by Politico, it claims that the USA House leadership was pressured by the United States Department of State.\n\nWhen asked why Newsom was turned away from the event, Newsom's office told the LA Times that it was a \"venue decision\" to not \"include an elected U.S. official\" in the event's programming.\n\nThe White House has not released a statement about Newsom's post.\n\nNoe Padilla is a Northern California Reporter for USA Today.

    "fullText": "AI czar David Sacks said California is taking a potentially \"scary direction\" if voters approve a wealth tax on billionaires.\n\n\"This is not a tax, this is an asset seizure,\" Sacks told CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nSacks, a longtime venture capitalist, is just one of the many voices in the tech industry who have denounced \"The Billionaire Act.\"\n\nCraft Ventures, the firm Sacks cofounded with Bill Lee, previously announced that Sacks had relocated to the Austin area in December. According to Bloomberg, Sacks is a billionaire and thus could have been subject to the tax.\n\nWhile the proposal is limited, Sacks said it would just be the beginning.\n\n\"It's not a one-time. It's a first time,\" he said. \"And if they get away with it, there'll be a second time and a third time. And this will be the beginning of something very new and different in this country.\"\n\nIf passed, California residents with a net worth of over $1.1 billion would face a one-time tax totalling 5% of their assets. (Residents with a net worth between $1 billion and $1.1 billion would pay a smaller tax.)\n\nGoogle cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin moved entities tied to them out of California ahead of the deadline. Other billionaires, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have said they won't leave the state.\n\nThe tax has yet to be approved. Supporters are still gathering enough signatures to put the issue before California voters this November. If they meet that threshold, a majority of voters would then need to support it. It's likely legal challenges would ensue as well.\n\nSacks said Gov. Gavin Newsom deserves blame for the current situation for not opposing the tax sooner and \"vocally\" enough.\n\nTara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Newsom's office, pointed to the governor's history of questioning earlier wealth tax proposals going back to 2020.\n\n\"Clearly, David Sacks didn't know what he was talking about,\" she said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nIn recent weeks, Newsom has continued to step up his opposition to such a tax.\n\n\"I'll do what I have to do to protect the state,\" Newsom told The New York Times in an interview earlier this month.\n\nIn a separate interview, Newsom said the news that billionaires like Brin and Page were leaving the state was exactly the response he had feared. California is home to more billionaires than any other state.\n\n\"This is my fear. It's just what I warned against,\" Newsom told Politico. \"It's happening.\"",

Last year a Los Angeles judge ruled that the platforms’ design features may be responsible for harm – and not just the third-party content posted on sites and apps.\n\nHistorically, tech firms have turned to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law underpinning US internet regulation that exempts platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users, as part of their legal defence. The first bellwether case is still due to begin on 27 January with jury selection.\n\nSnap remains a defendant in the other two cases.\n\nBeasley Allen, a law firm involved in the lawsuits on the plaintiff side, has said the cases could have profound consequences including billions of dollars in damages, forcing changes in platform design and new US regulations governing how tech firms interact with minors.\n\n“The litigation is being compared to past landmark cases against big tobacco and opioid manufacturers – industries that were held accountable for public health harms after years of denial,” the firm said in a statement last year.\n\nSnap, Meta, TikTok and YouTube have been contacted for comment.",

    "title": "How to Kill a Fish",
    "description": "The Japanese chef Junya Yamasaki mastered a butchery technique that results in tastier seafood—and he’s taught some Southern California fishermen how to do it, too.",
    "fullText": "The method is considered significantly more humane than the standard alternatives for killing a fish (thwacking it on the head, letting it suffocate), and is analogous to halal and kosher butchery, which both require that animals be slaughtered with a swift, decisive cut to the throat. It also results in fish that tastes better and stays fresh significantly longer. “The process brings out the best characteristic of every species,” Yamasaki told me—a firm silkiness for white fish, a clean acidity for tuna. It works in part by stemming the flood of stress hormones and other chemicals that a fish’s body begins to release upon capture, staving off rigor mortis and the stink of decay. Conner Mitchell, a restaurateur and a commercial fisherman, and the captain of the Jamaica Day—the small pilothouse boat we were fishing on—was impressed the first time he saw Yamasaki do it. “I’m looking at a fish that would have been stiff, now as flexible as tissue paper,” Mitchell said.\n\nIn Japan, you can assume that the fish at any good restaurant met its end by way of ike and shinkei jime; in the U.S., the same is true at restaurants offering catch imported from Tokyo’s famed Toyosu Market. Among the fishermen of Southern California, the practice can largely be traced to Yamasaki, whose evangelism has quietly transformed the local seafood supply. On the deck of the Jamaica Day, Mitchell and an array of other energetic restaurant-industry dudes in their thirties—all of whom learned the technique under Yamasaki’s tutelage—set up rods, checked the boat’s radar, and gleefully spotted clusters of birds diving in the distance, which signalled that schools of bonito swam beneath them. Whenever a line began to jerk, the group exploded in a joyful chorus. Then the men took turns reeling the fish in, and putting them out of their misery.\n\nTwice, I reeled in a bonito myself—a process that I found surprisingly intimate, just me and an invisible squirming weight at the other end of the line. Both times, I struggled as I turned the crank, heart pounding, almost certain that I wouldn’t succeed, until I caught sight of a silver flash at the water’s surface. Then Danny Miller or Cole Moser—a chef and a bartender, respectively—would pull it on board. As Miller gutted one particularly beautiful specimen, tossing its organs into the spray before slipping it into a slurry of ice and salt water, he pointed out that, because of the ike and shinkei jime, the fish had retained its vibrant color. If it had died slowly, it would have already gone dull and gray.",

    "title": "Uber, often sued over car crashes, pushes for law to limit lawyer fees",
    "description": "The ride share giant is advocating for changes to California law that would limit how much lawyers can collect in fees. Attorneys say it will obliterate their personal injury practices and leave victims unable to sue.",
    "fullText": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nThe long-simmering fight between some of L.A.’s best-known billboard attorneys and Uber, one of their most frequent targets, is poised to spill out of the courtroom and onto the November ballot.\n\nThe ride-share giant is gathering signatures for an initiative that, if passed by voters, would cap how much attorneys can earn in vehicle collision cases. The company pledges the change will give victims a larger cut of their settlement money, alleging predatory attorneys are inflating medical bills to increase their own profits.\n\nLawyers claim it will decimate their lucrative niche — car crash lawsuits in the automobile haven that is California — and ultimately leave thousands of people with small or challenging cases unable to sue because they can’t find an attorney.\n\nThis fight, lawyers say, is existential.\n\nAttorneys from Sweet James and Jacoby & Meyers — the names and faces of which will be imprinted in the minds of most California drivers — have given almost $1 million to a committee opposing the ballot measure, according to campaign filings. Dozens of other deep-pocketed attorneys have joined, raising an impressive war chest already surpassing $46 million.\n\n“Uber knows darn well what they’ve done,” said Nicholas Rowley, among those leading the opposition. “This law is designed to wipe out ordinary working people’s ability to get representation.”\n\nAttorneys have condemned the fee cap as a Trojan horse meant to trick voters into wrecking the delicate math behind personal injury lawsuits. Currently, personal injury attorneys typically take 33% to 40% of a client’s payout. That is enough, they say, for them to earn a living and risk taking cases on a contingency fee basis — meaning, if they lose, they don’t get paid.\n\nUber’s proposal would cap attorney fees for car crash cases at 25% and require extra costs — filing fees, depositions, experts — to be calculated before the fee split rather than coming out of the client’s portion.\n\nThe two sides have conflicting views of who would be expected to pay for medical fees, which often drain a significant portion of an injured client’s payout. Attorneys said in order to guarantee clients get 75% of the money, lawyers will have to foot the bill for these medical costs, opening the possibility they would walk away with nothing. Uber said the question of who covers medical costs is “not contemplated by the measure” and it expects clients would pay.\n\nThe measure would tightly limit what medical expenses can be claimed and curb most damages to rates based on insurance. A doctor-led political action committee opposing the measure has raised more than $4 million, according to campaign finance records, arguing it will prevent Californians from getting treatment.\n\nUber said in a statement that nothing in the measure prevents car accident victims from securing doctors and lawyers. Instead, the company said, the measure is aimed at tackling a perennial problem in California’s legal system: attorneys pushing car crash victims into expensive surgeries in order to fatten their fees. The only Californians affected, Uber claims, will be “shady billboard lawyers whose business model relies on abusing auto accident victims for their own personal gain.”\n\n“Californians deserve a system that prioritizes victims over billboard lawyers,” said Adam Blinick, Uber’s head of public policy. “Capping attorney fees, banning kickbacks, and ending inflated medical billing are common-sense reforms that will protect auto accident victims and lower costs, and we’re confident voters will agree.”\n\nUber has poured fuel on the fire with federal racketeering lawsuits targeting both Downtown LA Law Group, or DTLA, and Jacob Emrani, two prominent personal injury law offices in Southern California. The lawsuits allege the attorneys had “side agreements” with certain doctors to inflate medical bills for unnecessary procedures to get a larger payout.\n\nIn an Instagram post, DTLA called the lawsuit a “calculated attempt by a billion-dollar corporation” to suppress legitimate claims. An attorney representing Emrani called it meritless and part of a campaign “to shut the courthouse doors to victims injured by Uber drivers.”\n\nGearing up for a fight, Consumer Attorneys of California, a powerful trial lawyer trade group, is pushing three ballot measures of its own, including one seeking to increase legal liability for ride-share companies if a passenger is sexually assaulted by a driver and the other aiming to nullify the fee-capping measure if it passes. Billboards have sprung up across Los Angeles reminding Californians that Uber is the subject of a string of recent New York Times investigations into sexual assault by drivers.\n\nThe company said it has invested billions in keeping riders safe and has “done more than any other company to confront” sexual violence.\n\nConsumer Watchdog, a consumer advocacy group that sponsored some of the billboards and receives funding from trial attorneys, put out a “consumer alert” branding the fee cap as a “license to kill” measure, claiming it would ultimately pave the way for Uber to move forward with robotaxis without worrying about getting sued. Uber said this was “flat-out untrue” and the measure has nothing to do with autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe push by Uber comes at a tense point for California’s legal bar. The Times reported this fall on private investors looking to bankroll California sex abuse cases, and separate allegations of fraudulent lawsuits and unethical conduct by Downtown LA Law Group, a firm known for car crash lawsuits that played a prominent role in L.A. County’s $4-billion sex abuse settlement.\n\nDTLA has denied all wrongdoing and said it operates “with unwavering integrity, prioritizing client welfare.”\n\nSome attorneys worry about how voters will perceive their industry when it’s time to cast ballots.\n\n“I’ll tell you straight up, we could do a better job policing ourselves,” said Rowley, who said he believed the State Bar had historically been weak on California lawyers. “It creates a situation where Uber can do what it’s doing.”\n\nCalls for reform within California’s legal community have gained momentum in recent months.\n\nJoseph Nicchitta, the county’s interim chief executive officer, called on the State Bar to implement “badly needed ethical reforms” that would make big personal injury cases less profitable for lawyers. Attorney and business advocacy groups have made public pleas to keep private equity out of the state’s legal landscape, worrying it fuels frivolous lawsuits. Gov. Gavin Newsom has similarly expressed unease.\n\n“Our legal system is meant to provide justice, transparency, and accountability — not a business model that uses survivors of abuse or trauma as a revenue stream,” said a spokesperson for the governor. “California can — and must — hold two truths at the same time: standing unequivocally with survivors and victims, while also demanding integrity within the law firms and other businesses that work within our legal system.”\n\nCalifornians unhappy with problem law firms already have a way to ding them without the ballot measure, Uber’s opponents argue. A new law went into effect Jan. 1 giving private citizens the right to sue an attorney for unethical practices. Many such practices are already illegal but seldom prosecuted. That includes advertising containing false promises and using third parties to solicit clients.\n\nThe Times reported this fall that nine plaintiffs represented by Downtown LA Law Group were paid by recruiters to sue the county for sex abuse in juvenile halls, four of whom said they were told to make up claims. The firm has denied paying anyone to file lawsuits.\n\n“This is exactly why we wrote the bill,” said Sen. Tom Umberg (D-Santa Ana), a lawyer who oversees the Senate Judiciary Committee, in response to The Times’ Dec. 31 story on the firm. “I expect that someone will take it upon themselves to actually enforce that law.”",

    "description": "Scottie Scheffler is set to make his 2026 debut at The American Express this week in Southern California.",
    "fullText": "The Hawaii leg of the PGA Tour’s season is over, and it’s now time for perhaps the best version of The American Express we’ve ever seen.\n\nThe Tour lands in California this week for the second event of the season, and top-ranked Scottie Scheffler is making his debut. There are five of the top 10 players in the Official World Golf Rankings in the field this week, and 12 of the top 25 — including Russell Henley, Rob MacIntyre, Ben Griffin and Justin Rose.\n\nWhile there are plenty who can make a run for the title, all eyes will be on Scheffler — who is coming off a six-win season and his fourth straight Player of the Year award. Scheffler, who has been ranked No. 1 in the Official World Golf Rankings since early 2023, has won 13 times on Tour over the past two seasons combined, including at three major championships.\n\nSure, he’s had a few months off.

    "description": "As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.",
    "fullText": "If you’ve been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here’s what’s actually driving the nervousness: it’s not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.\n\nTake Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.\n\nDavid Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told The San Francisco Standard this week. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.\n\nBut that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.\n\nNow, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nBut the resistance is fierce and bipartisan. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They’ve called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and Peter Thiel’s firm leasing Miami office space last month. (Thiel has had ties to Miami for years — including a home — but an uncharacteristic press release about the move was seemingly meant to send a message.)\n\nEven Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting it. “This will be defeated, there’s no question in my mind,” he told the New York Times this week, adding that he’d been “relentlessly working behind the scenes” against the proposal. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nFor now, the union isn’t backing down. “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives,” said executive committee member Debru Carthan to the Journal last weekend. “The few who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.”\n\nThe proposal needs 875,000 signatures to make November’s ballot, where it would need a simple majority to pass.",

    "fullText": "A tiny Swiss ski town with a population of just over 10,000 will play host this week to a clash between two American politicians, President Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and their radically different visions of the future of capitalism.\n\nNewsom announced on Friday that he will travel more than 6,000 miles to make his return to Davos, Switzerland, to speak this week at the World Economic Forum.\n\nOpponents criticized Newsom for being an out-of-touch \"Davos Democrat\" for attending the elite gathering of business and world leaders at least five times while he was mayor of San Francisco between 2004 and 2011.\n\nNewsom's return to the annual gathering of business and political elites is all about displaying a forceful rebuke to President Donald Trump on the world stage as Newsom potentially prepares a run for president, political experts told Business Insider.\n\n\"Newsom's arrival at Davos confirms his desire to be seen as the Democratic Party leader and go-to guy for world leaders wanting an alternative to President Trump,\" Sally Susman, a longtime democratic fundraiser, said.\n\nIn speeches and meetings, Newsom plans to argue that Trump's economic agenda has been a failure that other leaders should not be part of, Izzy Gardon, a Newsom spokesperson, said.\n\n\"The Governor will be bringing an extra suitcase of kneepads for anyone lining up to bend the knee to Donald Trump,\" Gardon said.\n\nNewsom himself did not shy away from the main reason he is returning: to counterpunch Trump. The president will speak on Wednesday, a day before Newsom.\n\n\"Trump's economic agenda betrays our nation: it is not 'America First' but 'Trump First' — rewarding the favored, punishing the dissenters, and burdening the rest,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"At the World Economic Forum, I will forcefully confront these abuses and resolutely defend the principles to which California owes its economic strength: disciplined governance, world-leading universities, boundless innovation, and an open embrace of global cultures.\"\n\nNewsom, who has yet to officially announce his candidacy, looks more presidential rubbing shoulders at a gathering of world leaders than he would staying in Sacramento, according to Ambassador Derek Shearer, the Chevalier Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College.\n\n\"By coming to Davos, he can combine his role as the leading Democratic critic of Trump and as a serious contender to replace him as president,\" Shearer said. \"Of course, it's a high-stakes game, but so far, he is playing it well.\"\n\nNewsom will be rubbing shoulders with some of the richest people in the world at a time when some billionaires are fleeing California ahead of a ballot proposal that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents with a net worth of more than $1 billion.\n\nNewsom has said he opposes the measure. It is yet to be seen if he will address the matter at Davos.",

Gavin Newsom announced late last week that he would show up at Davos essentially to rebut whatever President Donald Trump plans to say, he specifically zoned in on, what else? Capitalism.\n\nAt Davos, the Democratic governor plans to \"draw a clear line between democratic capitalism and crony capitalism,\" according to his office. Newsom will \"contrast California's rules-based, competitive economic model with Trump's politics of intimidation, favoritism, and self-dealing.\"\n\nIn short, Newsom wants to articulate his own version of capitalism on the global stage.\n\nThat, coupled with Trump's Wednesday speech, which is expected to touch on affordability, shows just how hot the topic is.\n\nYou might recall that last month we put out a survey seeking your thoughts on the future of capitalism. And in the new year, we started a series on the subject. The first piece detailed the federal government's investments in private-sector companies under this White House. Newsom's office called those investments \"an unprecedented assault on free markets\" and took issue with other Trump moves.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Newsom's statements. A White House official earlier told Business Insider they viewed these equity stakes \"as a very powerful tool that we're using very judiciously in very specific sectors for very specific reasons,\" for purposes of US economic and national security.\n\nWe will stay all over this subject at Davos this week.

    "fullText": "A couple has been arrested after they were caught having sex in the parking lot of a Maryland Applebee's.\n\nMaryland State Police confirmed that Trooper Anthony Jones responded to a report of indecent exposure at the Applebee’s located at 45480 Miramar Way in California, Maryland, on Monday, January 12, according to a press release shared by the department.\n\nUpon Jones’ arrival, the police officer found Kaneesha Latasha Gross of Lexington Park and James Matthew Washington of Capitol Heights and caught them mid-coitus.\n\nBoth Gross, 35, and Washington, 58, were then arrested at the scene and taken to the St. Mary’s County Detention Center. They were both charged with indecent exposure and disorderly conduct, according to the release.\n\nGross and Washington have both likely been released on bond, as there are no records of the two on the St. Mary’s County Detention Center’s inmate search.\n\nCalifornia Man Charged with Kidnapping Maryland Woman from Crash Site and Raping Her\n\nThe Maryland State Police Department did not respond to Us Weekly’s request regarding an update on the case.\n\nIt is not currently clear if Gross or Washington have entered pleas or if they have retained legal representation. Meanwhile, it’s also not known how or if the two knew each other prior to the incident.\n\nAccording to the Maronick Law LLC website, disorderly contact is the leading reason for police calls in Ocean City, Maryland. The charge can be vague, with some Maryland law enforcement using it as a “catch-all” for any and all public disturbances.\n\nGenerally, disorderly conduct charges stem from “any behavior that disturbs the peace, endangers public safety or disrupts public order.” Common examples of disorderly conduct include public intoxication, public fighting, bar fights and engaging in excessively loud or disruptive behavior. In the case of Gross and Washington, disorderly conduct can also include sexual acts performed in public.\n\nBreaking Down ‘RHOP’ Star Wendy Osefo and Husband Eddie Osefo’s Arrest for Fraud: What We Know\n\nFor those who are found guilty of disorderly conduct in Maryland, common penalties include being sentenced to up to 60 days in jail and being ordered to pay a fine of up to $500. In fact, some people found guilty of the crime have been sentenced to both serve time and pay a fine.\n\nGross and Washington may face even more penalties if they are found guilty of the indecent exposure charge. For those charged with misdemeanor indecent exposure in Maryland, they can face up to 3 years in prison, be ordered to pay a fine of up to $1,000 or be given both penalties.\n\nIn order to be found guilty of the charge in Maryland, prosecutors must prove that “the act was intentional and involved the exposure of genitals in public or in the presence of someone other than a spouse,” according to Maronick Law LLC website. The law firm added that those who are charged with indecent exposure often argue about the intent behind the act or claim mistaken identity.\n\nMaryland law defines indecent exposure as when someone intentionally exposes their genitals in a public place or to someone that would not typically see their genitals. Examples of indecent exposure in Maryland include public urination or defecation, flashing, streaking, masturbation in public, sexual acts in public or mooning.",

    "description": "It might be surprising, but the data reflects a snapshot in time and could still shift in coming months.",
    "fullText": "For the first time in over two decades, California has reached a milestone. The entire state is officially free of drought conditions, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that, according to newly released federal data from the U.S. Drought Monitor, not a single square mile of California is currently classified as being in drought or even \"abnormally dry.\"\n\nThe last time the state achieved that status was December 2000 (although it came close in 2011). This achievement marks a hopeful moment after years of water scarcity, wildfire risks, and conservation mandates.\n\nPersistent rain and snow pushed California into its third year of above-average precipitation. Heavy storms around New Year's Day helped erase the last remaining dry pocket in Northern California's Modoc County, tipping the state to 100% drought-free status.\n\nThis is great news for communities across the state. Improved water availability eases pressure on farmers, reduces wildfire risk, and relieves households that have faced years of restrictions and rising utility costs. Healthier soil moisture and replenished reservoirs also strengthen ecosystems that have struggled under prolonged dry conditions.\n\nCalifornia's recent swings between extreme drought and intense rainfall are part of a broader pattern known as hydroclimate whiplash. That happens when the climate rapidly swings from wet to dry and back, challenging water management systems and communities alike.\n\nCalifornia will, of course, need to continue focusing on smart water management. But the moment offers residents something they haven't had in years: a little hiatus from worries over water.\n\nCalifornia State Climatologist Michael Anderson called it a \"great start\" to the wet season, as relayed by the Washington Post. Anderson noted that the data reflects a snapshot in time and could still shift in the coming months.\n\nBrian Fuchs of the National Drought Mitigation Center emphasized that water access still varies by region. Some mountain areas like the Sierra Nevada are experiencing \"snow drought.\" That happens when precipitation has fallen as rain rather than snow, reducing long-term water storage (due to reduced snowpack).\n\n\"Even though that map looks like everything's perfect, well, depending on where you're at in the state and depending on the sector you're in or how your water is delivered, there could still be some lingering problems,\" Fuchs said, as reported by the Washington Post.\n\nShould every state provide free energy-efficient home upgrades?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Marissa Chiechi took a leap of faith, moving from California to Virginia, to be with her boyfriend. She said it was the best decision she ever made.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Marissa Chiechi, 32, who relocated from Los Angeles to Alexandria, Virginia, in 2023. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I met my now-husband, Rejoy, on Bumble. I was born and raised in California. He's originally from Texas, but at the time, he was in Redondo Beach on a contract assignment with NASA.\n\nOur first date was actually a double date. We had a socially distanced picnic in the park — very COVID. After that, we ended up texting constantly. With everything going on, we got close quickly, and before long, we were seeing each other all the time.\n\nIt didn't take long for things to get serious. We met in May 2020, and by September — around his birthday — we took a trip to Joshua Tree. That was when he told me: he didn't know exactly when the move would happen, but his job would likely take him to the East Coast. He wanted to be upfront and not spring it on me later.\n\nI really appreciated his honesty. And, honestly, the idea of moving excited me. I've never been the biggest fan of California. I've always wanted four seasons, which you just don't get there. I'm not a beach person, either.\n\nSo when the possibility of leaving for the East Coast came up, it didn't feel like a hard decision. In my heart, I've always felt like an East Coast girl. I love fast-paced environments and big cities. Rejoy and I are also both big travelers, and it felt like it could be the start of an adventure.\n\nAbout six to eight months after that conversation, he told me he needed to be on the East Coast at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.\n\nI immediately assumed that moving to the East Coast meant we'd be living in New York, and I was like, \"Of course I'll go.\" I've been to New York more than 20 times, and I love it there. I'm also probably one of the few people who genuinely enjoys taking the subway.\n\nBut his job wasn't sending him to New York City. It was sending him to Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nI knew absolutely nothing about Alexandria, and at first, I assumed it was just going to be kind of in the middle of nowhere in Virginia. When I learned we'd be only about 15 minutes from Washington, D.C., I felt hopeful I'd still get the city energy I really wanted.\n\nEven so, I got a lot of \"You're leaving California?! Everyone wants to live in California!\" from friends and family. People also tried to scare me about the weather, too. They kept asking things like, \"Are you ready to be snowed in?\" and \"What about freezing temperatures?\"\n\nHowever, once I got there, it wasn't nearly as extreme as my circle made it out to be. I even bought a brand-new North Face coat that's been sitting in my closet ever since. I've barely worn it.\n\nThe hardest part of the move was shipping my car; it cost about $2,000. Luckily, I did get to put a few tubs of clothes in the car. Rejoy's brother is also a flight attendant, so he gets to fly for free, which means free checked bags. So I packed a lot of luggage and sent it with him.\n\nThe move has turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nWe got to Alexandria in 2021. It's a little Hallmark city. It's so cute, quaint, historic, and genuinely charming. It has more of a small-town feel, but with a diverse mix of people. It seems like a lot of people are drawn to it because they really enjoy a slower pace of life.\n\nAnd getting from Alexandria into DC is easy. There's a beautiful bridge, and the drive is only about 10 minutes. The scenery is incredible, and you even pass through Maryland.\n\nThe apartment we rented in Alexandria was selected sight unseen, though we did one virtual tour before signing the lease. It was a one-bedroom, 720-square-foot unit that cost $2,453 a month.\n\nSurprisingly, our rent was more expensive than what I had been paying in California. On top of that, we each paid between $350 and $400 a month to keep our cars in the parking garage.\n\nVirginia gets all four seasons, which was one of my favorite parts of living there. We had a really nice view from our apartment balcony, and I could literally see all the fall foliage and watch the leaves change color throughout the year. It was so beautiful.\n\nWhen I first moved to Alexandria, I definitely had moments when I felt down and really missed my friends and family. I didn't really know anyone there, and while I had a few friends who were in the DC area who would come visit, it could still feel lonely.\n\nRejoy could fly for free, so he visited his family in Texas whenever he wanted. I didn't have that option; I had to pay for my trips. So I didn't go home as much, but whenever I was feeling especially homesick, I'd find a way to make a visit happen.\n\nFor a while, it really did feel like it was just the two of us. That forced me to get comfortable with being alone and to genuinely be happy with myself—it helped me learn a lot more about who I am.\n\nEventually, a few people from my high school moved to Alexandria, and we became friends with their friends. Our circle slowly grew, but it took a long time.\n\nLooking back, it was empowering. I hadn't really moved anywhere before, but I've always been a traveler and someone who wants to explore. I remember thinking, \"Even if this doesn't work out, at least I'm in a new place.\"\n\nIn 2023, we got engaged. We were in Cappadocia to watch the hot air balloons, and I had no idea it was coming. The entire trip was a funny experience.\n\nHe had told me, very sneakily, to pack a nice dress, but our luggage got lost. To make it even more ironic, the weather was bad, and the hot air balloons didn't even take off that day.\n\nIn our engagement photos, the balloons are actually photoshopped in by the photographer. While it almost didn't feel \"right\" in the moment, it was still really special.\n\nIn 2024, Rejoy's contract ended, so we naturally had to ask ourselves: What do we do next? We didn't really want to stay in Alexandria because the type of home we wanted wasn't affordable. So it made sense for us to leave Virginia and reevaluate.\n\nWe moved in April 2025. For now, I'm back in Los Angeles, and he's in Texas. He just accepted another job in Austin, so I'll be moving there next. I'm really excited.\n\nIf there's one thing this whole experience has taught me, it's to stay open to opportunities and whatever comes next. Time goes by so fast, and I want to spend it traveling, being present, and fully experiencing what life has to offer.",

    "description": "Larry Page, Google cofounder, moves major assets and residence from California to Florida as the Billionaire Tax Act targets ultrawealthy residents.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page recently drew his line in the sand on a beach on the opposite side of California — and it cost him over $170 million.\n\nCalifornia has proposed the Billionaire Tax Act, which would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth over $1 billion. Page, whose net worth is $269 billion as of January according to Forbes, isn't giving California the option to tax him and is deserting the Golden State for a state on the opposite extreme of taxing the wealthy: Florida.\n\nThe proposed bill, which doesn't appear on the ballot until November, would retroactively tax billionaires living in California as of January 1. Conveniently, Page reportedly located a Florida residence just before then.\n\nPage purchased a 4.5-acre compound in Miami's glamorous Coconut Grove neighborhood in December 2025 for $101.5 million, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Miami-Dade County property records show late restaurateur Jonathan Lewis previously owned the property.\n\nAnd for good measure, property records show a trust linked to Page bought another property — less than a mile away from the other — for $71.9 million in January this year. The trust, Tropical Frontier Revocable Trust, lists Florida attorney Benjamin Babcock and Mary McFadden Quisenberry, the chief operating officer of Palo Alto, California-based Rosewood Family Advisors, as trustees. Babcock declined to comment on the transaction.\n\nTax filings from Page's family foundation, the Carl Victor Page Memorial Foundation, show Rosewood Family Advisors provided tax and accounting services for the foundation in 2024. Rosewood Family Advisors could not be reached for comment.\n\nPage also filed to move a number of his businesses from California to Delaware, Florida, and Texas, Business Insider reported earlier this year.\n\nAn agent involved in the $101.5-million transaction, Danny Hertzberg of The Jills Zeder Group, declined to comment on this particular deal. He said wealthy Californians have been lining up to buy homes in Florida recently.\n\n\"We started feeling an impact, let's say in early December, which really picked up going to the end of the year,\" Hertzberg told Business Insider. \"California's dominating the high end of the market. The market right now, in terms of offers and active buyers, has a huge California presence, and it's directly related to 5% net worth.\"\n\nWealthy people moving to South Florida isn't a new trend, though some of the most recent residents made large splashes. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, arguably, became the most notable Florida mover after building his own compound on an exclusive island in Miami's Biscayne Bay.\n\nSouth Florida tried a somewhat rebrand in the early 2020s as the Silicon Valley of the East and did attract some movers. This latest shift has serious legs and the potential to change the perception of South Florida, according to Hertzberg.\n\n\"All of the movement I've seen from California is primary residences — people putting roots down and planning to be here,\" Hertzberg said. \"I think that may push along an already strong existing trend as Miami emerges as a major destination for finance and tech.\"\n\n\"With the level and caliber of people that are looking, that have already acquired properties here, and that are moving here, I do think, on the overall business perspective of Miami, it's already one of the major players in the country, if not the world,\" Hertzberg added. \"And it's going to be elevated as one of the premier destinations for those industries of finance, tech, and everything related.\"",

(AP) — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against California that sought detailed voting records and personal data on its 23 million registered voters, concluding that the government's request was “unprecedented and illegal.”\n\nThe Trump administration's lawsuit, filed last year, contended that California and other states were illegally blocking the federal government's wide-ranging effort to scrutinize detailed voter data that states said was private and protected.\n\nThe administration “may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections” U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana said in his 33-page decision.\n\nFurthermore, the attempt to gather and centralize the personal information would have a chilling effect on voter registration and threaten “the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy,” the judge ruled.\n\n“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the executive (branch) without action from Congress,” Carter said. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections.”\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIt has accused states of failing to respond sufficiently to questions about the procedures they take to maintain voter rolls. The department has sued 23 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, and the District of Columbia for detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.\n\nState election officials have questioned what the DOJ plans to do with that information. Last fall 10 Democratic secretaries of state wrote Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to express concern over reports that the DOJ was sharing state voter data with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, operates a program that checks citizenship status.\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Shirley Weber, the state's chief elections officer, said in a statement that California would “continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”",

    "description": "California Attorney General Rob Bonta's investigation comes amid a growing backlash to xAI and its Grok chatbot.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk's xAI is now facing pressure from US regulators over Grok's generation of nonconsensual sexualized images of real people.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that his office was investigating the numerous reports of such images.\n\n\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said in a statement. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"\n\nThe news comes after officials in India, the UK, Indonesia, and Malaysia have taken their own varying actions against Grok. Indonesia and Malaysia went so far as to block access to Grok.\n\nOfcom, the UK's communications regulator, announced its investigation earlier this week. Prime Minister Keir Starmer previously told lawmakers that X could \"lose the right to self-regulate.\"\n\nIn response to Business Insider's request for comment about Bonta's probe, xAI replied, \"Legacy Media Lies.\" Musk's AI company frequently responds to media requests with that line.\n\nAmid the backlash, xAI limited access to Grok's image generation to paying subscribers.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Musk said he was unaware of \"any naked underage images generated by Grok.\" Musk had previously said anyone asking Grok to make illegal content \"will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\"\n\n\"Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images, it does so only according to user requests,\" Musk wrote on X. \"When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state.\"\n\nMusk's statement belies many of the instances that regulators were looking into. Namely, the investigations were sparked by concerns about users asking Grok to sexualize images, such as depicting a person in a bikini when the original photo did not show them in such a state of dress.\n\nThe US Senate unanimously passed a bill via voice vote on Tuesday that would give victims a federal civil right to sue users who ask AI to create such images. The text of legislation, called \"The Defiance Act,\" mentions the digital manipulation of a photo to \"remove the clothing of the individual so that the person appears to be nude.\"\n\nSen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, who wrote the bill, said it was aimed at stopping instances like the Grok images.\n\n\"Recent reports showed that X, formerly Twitter, can ask its AI chatbot Grok to undress women and underage girls in photos,\" Durbin said on the Senate floor. \"Grok will comply to show various states of undress with images I won't repeat for the record, but they're horrible.\"\n\nIt is unclear if the bill will receive a vote in the House.\n\nLast year, President Donald Trump signed bipartisan legislation into law that requires social media platforms to remove non-consensual photos, as well as AI deepfakes, within 48 hours of receiving a request to do so.",

    "fullText": "Musk attempts to recast AI tool’s misuse. Plus, tech billionaires plot against a proposed California tax on their fortunes\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, US tech editor for the Guardian. Today, we discuss Elon Musk’s rosy depiction of Grok’s image generation controversy; the seven-figure panic among Silicon Valley billionaires over a proposed wealth tax in California, though with one notable exception; and how AI and robotics have revitalized the Consumer Electronics Showcase.\n\nThe firestorm over the Grok AI tool has been raging for more than a week now, and it shows no signs of dying down.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the rising backlash against Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool, which in recent weeks has allowed users to generate thousands of sexualized images of women. Some of the images show real women, some are fake, some are nonconsensual, and some depict children, all in “minimal clothing”, as the AI tool itself described them.\n\nX and its parent company, xAI, have taken some measures to curb the flood. The social network shut off its image generation feature for users who do not pay, which constitute the majority of X’s users.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Musk has obstinately recast the AI tool’s problems as everything but what they really are. He’s been promoting its popularity as if it were a piece of productivity software. He crows about its download numbers with dubious claims. On 10 January; he celebrated Grok reaching the top spot in New Zealand’s version of Apple’s App Store. (Rankings by the analytics firm SimilarWeb of the most-downloaded apps in New Zealand, which were updated the same day as Musk’s tweet, put Grok in 14th place.) The same day, he reposted a tweet about Grok reaching the No 1 spot in Thailand’s Apple App Store. (SimilarWeb’s rankings do not show Grok in the top 50 most-downloaded apps in the country.) On 9 January, he retweeted a post about Google searches for Grok spiking. (I would guess the increase in searches is evidence of great interest in the AI tool’s scandal more so than interest in using it.)\n\nIn response to the UK’s threats to ban the AI tool, he accused the country’s government of stifling free speech. After watchdogs cited instances of Grok undressing minors, he said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” handing the responsibility to moderate his social network to law enforcement and courts. “Illegal” is in a court’s hands and frees him from moderating all but the most heinous content.\n\nPerhaps to Musk, all press is good press? He may be right: his AI tool seems likely to accrue more users and few penalties as a result of the flood of nearly naked images.\n\nGrok has faced some repercussions: the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched an investigation into xAI and Grok, and possible punishments could include a total ban. The Internet Watch Foundation, also based in the UK, announced it had found instances of child sexual abuse material generated by Grok in Dark Web forums. X’s revenue in the UK has plummeted by 60% as concerns over content moderation and brand safety grow. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have limited access to the AI tool in response.\n\nBut missing from the chorus decrying Grok are the two de facto smartphone regulators of smartphone software, Apple and Google, operators of the world’s biggest mobile app stores. Neither has indicated whether the Grok’s output violates their app stores’ terms of service. In the US, there’s been little backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nThe lesson for Musk and other tech leaders seems apparent: the fewer restrictions you place on AI, the more shocking content you allow it to generate, the greater your engagement and your profit.\n\nTech’s billionaires are plotting against a proposed tax on their fortunes that may appear on ballots across California in November.\n\nVenture capitalist and antichrist evangelist Peter Thiel has already made a $3m donation to fight the proposal, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the state. Other billionaires have started an encrypted group chat on Signal to strategize against it, which includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar” David Sacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s called “Save California”. My colleague Dara Kerr reports on the division among billionaires:\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nUnder the proposed tax, Huang would pay roughly $7bn, and Page and Brin would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, held annually in Las Vegas for decades since its start in 1967, made global news this year. Nvidia and AMD chose it as the forum for major announcements on new hardware and software. Samsung announced a double folding phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Lego debuted a “smart brick” that seems quite fun as well. Robots abounded, rechristened as “physical AI”.\n\nIt’s been quite the turnaround for CES. For much of the 2010s, hardware announcements rarely made for top headlines. New DVD players or TVs did not make a splash. Smartphones dominated, and they all looked extremely similar. Apple, the most valuable company in the world at the end of the decade, even skipped it entirely. Now, however, Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world, and it chose CES to present what’s next. Artificial intelligence and robotics have breathed new life into CES. The themes and innovations that define the convention are broader and affect more industries outside tech than they once did.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I predicted that consumer technology would take many strange new shapes in the coming year, which seems to already be true as we view new developments in robotics. Humanoid robots debuted at CES, including one from Hyundai and Boston Dynamics. My colleague Samuel Gibbs dubbed a laundry-folding robot one of the best things about the convention.\n\nMeta blocked nearly 550,000 accounts in first days of Australia’s under-16s social media ban\n\nIran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some time\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with Apple\n\n‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at risk",

    "description": "After more than a decade living in Spain, visiting the US now brings reverse culture shock, from car dependency and traffic to high costs and busy lives.",
    "fullText": "I've lived in Spain for over a decade. I'm always excited to go \"home\" to visit family and friends in the San Francisco Bay Area, and spend time in a place that is so familiar.\n\nI usually visit once a year. My first week back, I'm reminiscing, and my brain is buzzing thinking about how I can move back and what my life would look like. Yet, by the third or fourth week — if I stay that long — reality settles in. The high cost of living, traffic, aggressive drivers, friends having packed schedules, needing a car to get around, unless you live in the heart of a city.\n\nI'm reminded that I'm happy where I live, navigating different cultural customs and speaking Spanish every day.\n\nThe truth is, several aspects of American life become harder for me to adapt to the longer I'm away. I experience reverse cultural shock when I visit.\n\nA car is necessary for going grocery shopping, to the gym or a dance class, meeting up with friends, or essentially getting from point A to B, unless you live in the city and can walk or rely on public transportation. There's no denying that life in the United States revolves around the car. Public transit in the suburbs isn't efficient, often doesn't take you where you need to go, or is nonexistent.\n\nI love that where I live, I can walk out my door and go to the grocery store, coffee shop, bar, or restaurant, or take public transit.\n\nAs more people have moved to the Bay Area, housing prices have soared, along with an increase in cars on the road. Commute traffic is so bad that distances that normally take an hour can take two or three hours. The freeway can feel more like a parking lot with stop-and-go traffic.\n\nWhen I visit, I'm advised to adhere to specific times of leaving the house or returning, to avoid sitting in excessive amounts of traffic. In other words, plans and scheduling are influenced by commute traffic, which typically starts around 2 or 3 p.m. and lasts until 7 p.m.\n\nI love trying new restaurants and visiting coffee shops, but with costs continually rising, I'm less inclined to go out for coffee or eat a meal. How did a basic drip coffee become $5 or more, plus tax and an expected tip.\n\nEating out, even if it's a hamburger and fries, always costs a minimum of $30, plus tax and tip. And more often than not, I'm disappointed by the experience. Now, I prefer to stay in and make a meal.\n\nFriends are busy with their work and families. When I lived in the US, I was often frustrated that some friends wouldn't have time to meet up for coffee or a meal out — their calendar was filled for the next two or three months.\n\nFriends block out time in their calendars to see me often, but they remind me that if I lived nearby, we wouldn't see each other more frequently.\n\nI'm not a big shopper. I never liked spending my time in malls or shopping centers — finding parking, navigating crowds, browsing and trying on clothing, and hoping for a successful purchase. I want new outfits in my closet, but I'd rather forgo the shopping experience.\n\nHowever, when I'm in the US, I'm eager to go to Costco and stock up on basics, such as socks, sports bras, pajamas, a pair of Levi's jeans when they have them, and whatever else that catches my attention. I also love going to T.J. Maxx and Marshall's for the treasure hunt of what bargains I will find, and I certainly don't need it, but I want it.\n\nOn my last visit, I told my mom, \"These stores are designed so you buy stuff you don't really need, but you feel like you're getting a good deal.\"\n\nPeople drive fast, aggressively, and most seem to be annoyed and angered that other drivers are on the road. Over 10 years ago, drivers would speed up rather than let me merge when I turned on my blinker. I stopped getting annoyed and changed my perspective — I assumed drivers would accelerate. On the rare occasions when they let me in, I was slow to respond because I didn't expect it.\n\nSo it's no surprise that I don't miss driving. I'm stressed and on edge when I drive in the Bay Area.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rick Havacko, a 58-year-old corporate communications lead in Austin. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWorking remotely during the pandemic was the springboard for my move from California to Texas. I was born and raised in Orange County. I realized that although I love Laguna Niguel, I didn't want to live the rest of my life there.\n\nIt's beautiful, but once you get outside the city, it's congested, and prices are high.\n\nI've worked for Toshiba Business for 13 years, and I've always been fully remote. After my employer approved my move, the choice was between Austin (where I had visited before and enjoyed) and Nashville, which I had heard great things about.\n\nAfter traveling to both places in the summer of 2021, I decided to make Austin my home.\n\nBoth areas featured all the benefits of city life with a rural feel. Nashville is an amazing city and very similar to Austin. It has great music, culture, and a very creative vibe with tons of energy.\n\nWhat drew me to Austin is that it has my gym, LA Fitness, so I felt like I could really hit the ground running.\n\nI've been here for about four and a half years, and it's been one of the best things I've ever done.\n\nGrowing up in Orange County, the furthest I ever went was to San Diego for college, which is so close I could come home anytime I wanted. Austin was my first permanent move, so I had a little trepidation.\n\nI remember driving all night past Camp Pendleton, finally arriving in Tucson, Arizona, to spend the night. I got there about 1 a.m., and I felt a lot of uncertainty, like, Am I really going to like this place?\n\nWhen I hit the Hill Country, just before Fredericksburg, and headed into Austin, I passed the beautiful sawgrass and oak trees, and a sense of calm enveloped me, giving me the feeling that I was in a good place.\n\nI moved to Dripping Springs, which is 20 miles west of downtown Austin. It's more affordable than Southern California and less congested, but ultimately, it came down to the energy of the city and its people.\n\nI look outside my window, and often see deer, foxes, wild turkey, and even a Longhorn steer walking by my fence. I would never experience that in Laguna Niguel. I love nature.\n\nI no longer have immediate family in California, but I miss my friends back home. Making new friends has been the biggest challenge I've faced, but I keep trying. I've joined a volleyball league and play soccer and softball, where I meet people.\n\nI miss the world-class beaches in California; here we're pretty landlocked. I'm also a huge Angels fan. I grew up following the team, and Toshiba has a suite at Angel Stadium, so I used to attend many games. I also enjoyed attending LA Galaxy games. For now, I've adopted the University of Texas Longhorns for football and baseball, and I go to those games.\n\nWhile Texans are not required to file a state income tax return (only a federal one), property taxes appear to be significantly higher here. Properties themselves, however, are relatively inexpensive here. My property here is about twice the size of my home in California, and it was less expensive.\n\nOverall, it's still cheaper to live here, although Austin is one of the priciest cities in Texas. Gas is more affordable in Austin, but other living costs are comparable. I kept my same salary when I moved.\n\nHere in Dripping Springs, you see people with big belt buckles and cowboy boots. It's cool and culturally different from Orange County.\n\nDowntown Austin is one of the most vibrant and exciting places on the planet. It bustles with positive energy, with live music at pretty much every turn, and the University of Texas at Austin adds to that vibe.\n\nI'm very happy here and plan to stay permanently.",

The plan at the time, according to sources, was to send 14 reporters and photographers to Tokyo to produce a separate daily color section, as it first did in 1984 when the games were held in Los Angeles. The Times will be covering next month’s Winter Games in Italy with one writer as Thuc Nhi Nguyen will be taking a break from the Lakers beat to cover the games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nWhen Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018, he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” Since the pandemic in 2020, however, the sports section has been reduced to the final four or five pages of the California section five days a week, with a standalone sports section of six to eight pages appearing only twice per week.\n\nDespite its statewide branding, the California Post's initial sports coverage will be centered squarely on Los Angeles, with a primary emphasis on the sports and teams the Los Angeles Times still covers in the Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA.\n\nHernandez and Harris will lead its MLB and Dodgers coverage, while Southern California News Group Lakers beat writer Khobi Price and longtime Lakers reporter Melissa Rohlin, who joined the Post last week, will anchor its NBA and Lakers coverage. Bonsignore will lead the NFL and Rams coverage while Bolch will lead college sports coverage, focusing on USC and UCLA.\n\nThe staffing losses at the Los Angeles Times come amid continued upheaval at the paper, which has faced newsroom cuts, buyouts and mounting uncertainty about its long-term investment in daily sports coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Post is not done hiring. Sources familiar with the startup’s plans say the outlet is continuing to pursue additional Times sports writers and other well-known local journalists before its launch on Jan. 26.",

However, one thing all lottery winners have to take into account is the fact that their prizes will be taxed.\n\nSo how much do you really get after taxes?\n\nIt depends on a couple of factors: do you have to pay state taxes where you live? Will you take the lump sum payment or the annuity payout?\n\nAccording to Mega Millions' website, those electing to take the annuity option get one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments. Powerball follows an identical process for paying out its jackpot winners.\n\nThis report used information provided by the California Lottery. The article also referenced previous FOX 11 reports.",
