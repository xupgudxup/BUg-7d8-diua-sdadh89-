    "description": "California Attorney General Rob Bonta's investigation comes amid a growing backlash to xAI and its Grok chatbot.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk's xAI is now facing pressure from US regulators over Grok's generation of nonconsensual sexualized images of real people.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that his office was investigating the numerous reports of such images.\n\n\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said in a statement. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"\n\nThe news comes after officials in India, the UK, Indonesia, and Malaysia have taken their own varying actions against Grok. Indonesia and Malaysia went so far as to block access to Grok.\n\nOfcom, the UK's communications regulator, announced its investigation earlier this week. Prime Minister Keir Starmer previously told lawmakers that X could \"lose the right to self-regulate.\"\n\nIn response to Business Insider's request for comment about Bonta's probe, xAI replied, \"Legacy Media Lies.\" Musk's AI company frequently responds to media requests with that line.\n\nAmid the backlash, xAI limited access to Grok's image generation to paying subscribers.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Musk said he was unaware of \"any naked underage images generated by Grok.\" Musk had previously said anyone asking Grok to make illegal content \"will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\"\n\n\"Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images, it does so only according to user requests,\" Musk wrote on X. \"When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state.\"\n\nMusk's statement belies many of the instances that regulators were looking into. Namely, the investigations were sparked by concerns about users asking Grok to sexualize images, such as depicting a person in a bikini when the original photo did not show them in such a state of dress.\n\nThe US Senate unanimously passed a bill via voice vote on Tuesday that would give victims a federal civil right to sue users who ask AI to create such images. The text of legislation, called \"The Defiance Act,\" mentions the digital manipulation of a photo to \"remove the clothing of the individual so that the person appears to be nude.\"\n\nSen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, who wrote the bill, said it was aimed at stopping instances like the Grok images.\n\n\"Recent reports showed that X, formerly Twitter, can ask its AI chatbot Grok to undress women and underage girls in photos,\" Durbin said on the Senate floor. \"Grok will comply to show various states of undress with images I won't repeat for the record, but they're horrible.\"\n\nIt is unclear if the bill will receive a vote in the House.\n\nLast year, President Donald Trump signed bipartisan legislation into law that requires social media platforms to remove non-consensual photos, as well as AI deepfakes, within 48 hours of receiving a request to do so.",

    "fullText": "Musk attempts to recast AI tool’s misuse. Plus, tech billionaires plot against a proposed California tax on their fortunes\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, US tech editor for the Guardian. Today, we discuss Elon Musk’s rosy depiction of Grok’s image generation controversy; the seven-figure panic among Silicon Valley billionaires over a proposed wealth tax in California, though with one notable exception; and how AI and robotics have revitalized the Consumer Electronics Showcase.\n\nThe firestorm over the Grok AI tool has been raging for more than a week now, and it shows no signs of dying down.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the rising backlash against Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool, which in recent weeks has allowed users to generate thousands of sexualized images of women. Some of the images show real women, some are fake, some are nonconsensual, and some depict children, all in “minimal clothing”, as the AI tool itself described them.\n\nX and its parent company, xAI, have taken some measures to curb the flood. The social network shut off its image generation feature for users who do not pay, which constitute the majority of X’s users.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Musk has obstinately recast the AI tool’s problems as everything but what they really are. He’s been promoting its popularity as if it were a piece of productivity software. He crows about its download numbers with dubious claims. On 10 January; he celebrated Grok reaching the top spot in New Zealand’s version of Apple’s App Store. (Rankings by the analytics firm SimilarWeb of the most-downloaded apps in New Zealand, which were updated the same day as Musk’s tweet, put Grok in 14th place.) The same day, he reposted a tweet about Grok reaching the No 1 spot in Thailand’s Apple App Store. (SimilarWeb’s rankings do not show Grok in the top 50 most-downloaded apps in the country.) On 9 January, he retweeted a post about Google searches for Grok spiking. (I would guess the increase in searches is evidence of great interest in the AI tool’s scandal more so than interest in using it.)\n\nIn response to the UK’s threats to ban the AI tool, he accused the country’s government of stifling free speech. After watchdogs cited instances of Grok undressing minors, he said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” handing the responsibility to moderate his social network to law enforcement and courts. “Illegal” is in a court’s hands and frees him from moderating all but the most heinous content.\n\nPerhaps to Musk, all press is good press? He may be right: his AI tool seems likely to accrue more users and few penalties as a result of the flood of nearly naked images.\n\nGrok has faced some repercussions: the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched an investigation into xAI and Grok, and possible punishments could include a total ban. The Internet Watch Foundation, also based in the UK, announced it had found instances of child sexual abuse material generated by Grok in Dark Web forums. X’s revenue in the UK has plummeted by 60% as concerns over content moderation and brand safety grow. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have limited access to the AI tool in response.\n\nBut missing from the chorus decrying Grok are the two de facto smartphone regulators of smartphone software, Apple and Google, operators of the world’s biggest mobile app stores. Neither has indicated whether the Grok’s output violates their app stores’ terms of service. In the US, there’s been little backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nThe lesson for Musk and other tech leaders seems apparent: the fewer restrictions you place on AI, the more shocking content you allow it to generate, the greater your engagement and your profit.\n\nTech’s billionaires are plotting against a proposed tax on their fortunes that may appear on ballots across California in November.\n\nVenture capitalist and antichrist evangelist Peter Thiel has already made a $3m donation to fight the proposal, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the state. Other billionaires have started an encrypted group chat on Signal to strategize against it, which includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar” David Sacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s called “Save California”. My colleague Dara Kerr reports on the division among billionaires:\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nUnder the proposed tax, Huang would pay roughly $7bn, and Page and Brin would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, held annually in Las Vegas for decades since its start in 1967, made global news this year. Nvidia and AMD chose it as the forum for major announcements on new hardware and software. Samsung announced a double folding phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Lego debuted a “smart brick” that seems quite fun as well. Robots abounded, rechristened as “physical AI”.\n\nIt’s been quite the turnaround for CES. For much of the 2010s, hardware announcements rarely made for top headlines. New DVD players or TVs did not make a splash. Smartphones dominated, and they all looked extremely similar. Apple, the most valuable company in the world at the end of the decade, even skipped it entirely. Now, however, Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world, and it chose CES to present what’s next. Artificial intelligence and robotics have breathed new life into CES. The themes and innovations that define the convention are broader and affect more industries outside tech than they once did.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I predicted that consumer technology would take many strange new shapes in the coming year, which seems to already be true as we view new developments in robotics. Humanoid robots debuted at CES, including one from Hyundai and Boston Dynamics. My colleague Samuel Gibbs dubbed a laundry-folding robot one of the best things about the convention.\n\nMeta blocked nearly 550,000 accounts in first days of Australia’s under-16s social media ban\n\nIran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some time\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with Apple\n\n‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at risk",

    "description": "After more than a decade living in Spain, visiting the US now brings reverse culture shock, from car dependency and traffic to high costs and busy lives.",
    "fullText": "I've lived in Spain for over a decade. I'm always excited to go \"home\" to visit family and friends in the San Francisco Bay Area, and spend time in a place that is so familiar.\n\nI usually visit once a year. My first week back, I'm reminiscing, and my brain is buzzing thinking about how I can move back and what my life would look like. Yet, by the third or fourth week — if I stay that long — reality settles in. The high cost of living, traffic, aggressive drivers, friends having packed schedules, needing a car to get around, unless you live in the heart of a city.\n\nI'm reminded that I'm happy where I live, navigating different cultural customs and speaking Spanish every day.\n\nThe truth is, several aspects of American life become harder for me to adapt to the longer I'm away. I experience reverse cultural shock when I visit.\n\nA car is necessary for going grocery shopping, to the gym or a dance class, meeting up with friends, or essentially getting from point A to B, unless you live in the city and can walk or rely on public transportation. There's no denying that life in the United States revolves around the car. Public transit in the suburbs isn't efficient, often doesn't take you where you need to go, or is nonexistent.\n\nI love that where I live, I can walk out my door and go to the grocery store, coffee shop, bar, or restaurant, or take public transit.\n\nAs more people have moved to the Bay Area, housing prices have soared, along with an increase in cars on the road. Commute traffic is so bad that distances that normally take an hour can take two or three hours. The freeway can feel more like a parking lot with stop-and-go traffic.\n\nWhen I visit, I'm advised to adhere to specific times of leaving the house or returning, to avoid sitting in excessive amounts of traffic. In other words, plans and scheduling are influenced by commute traffic, which typically starts around 2 or 3 p.m. and lasts until 7 p.m.\n\nI love trying new restaurants and visiting coffee shops, but with costs continually rising, I'm less inclined to go out for coffee or eat a meal. How did a basic drip coffee become $5 or more, plus tax and an expected tip.\n\nEating out, even if it's a hamburger and fries, always costs a minimum of $30, plus tax and tip. And more often than not, I'm disappointed by the experience. Now, I prefer to stay in and make a meal.\n\nFriends are busy with their work and families. When I lived in the US, I was often frustrated that some friends wouldn't have time to meet up for coffee or a meal out — their calendar was filled for the next two or three months.\n\nFriends block out time in their calendars to see me often, but they remind me that if I lived nearby, we wouldn't see each other more frequently.\n\nI'm not a big shopper. I never liked spending my time in malls or shopping centers — finding parking, navigating crowds, browsing and trying on clothing, and hoping for a successful purchase. I want new outfits in my closet, but I'd rather forgo the shopping experience.\n\nHowever, when I'm in the US, I'm eager to go to Costco and stock up on basics, such as socks, sports bras, pajamas, a pair of Levi's jeans when they have them, and whatever else that catches my attention. I also love going to T.J. Maxx and Marshall's for the treasure hunt of what bargains I will find, and I certainly don't need it, but I want it.\n\nOn my last visit, I told my mom, \"These stores are designed so you buy stuff you don't really need, but you feel like you're getting a good deal.\"\n\nPeople drive fast, aggressively, and most seem to be annoyed and angered that other drivers are on the road. Over 10 years ago, drivers would speed up rather than let me merge when I turned on my blinker. I stopped getting annoyed and changed my perspective — I assumed drivers would accelerate. On the rare occasions when they let me in, I was slow to respond because I didn't expect it.\n\nSo it's no surprise that I don't miss driving. I'm stressed and on edge when I drive in the Bay Area.",

    "description": "Rick Havacko decided to move to a new state after working remotely during the pandemic in California. He narrowed his choices to Austin or Nashville.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rick Havacko, a 58-year-old corporate communications lead in Austin. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWorking remotely during the pandemic was the springboard for my move from California to Texas. I was born and raised in Orange County. I realized that although I love Laguna Niguel, I didn't want to live the rest of my life there.\n\nIt's beautiful, but once you get outside the city, it's congested, and prices are high.\n\nI've worked for Toshiba Business for 13 years, and I've always been fully remote. After my employer approved my move, the choice was between Austin (where I had visited before and enjoyed) and Nashville, which I had heard great things about.\n\nAfter traveling to both places in the summer of 2021, I decided to make Austin my home.\n\nBoth areas featured all the benefits of city life with a rural feel. Nashville is an amazing city and very similar to Austin. It has great music, culture, and a very creative vibe with tons of energy.\n\nWhat drew me to Austin is that it has my gym, LA Fitness, so I felt like I could really hit the ground running.\n\nI've been here for about four and a half years, and it's been one of the best things I've ever done.\n\nGrowing up in Orange County, the furthest I ever went was to San Diego for college, which is so close I could come home anytime I wanted. Austin was my first permanent move, so I had a little trepidation.\n\nI remember driving all night past Camp Pendleton, finally arriving in Tucson, Arizona, to spend the night. I got there about 1 a.m., and I felt a lot of uncertainty, like, Am I really going to like this place?\n\nWhen I hit the Hill Country, just before Fredericksburg, and headed into Austin, I passed the beautiful sawgrass and oak trees, and a sense of calm enveloped me, giving me the feeling that I was in a good place.\n\nI moved to Dripping Springs, which is 20 miles west of downtown Austin. It's more affordable than Southern California and less congested, but ultimately, it came down to the energy of the city and its people.\n\nI look outside my window, and often see deer, foxes, wild turkey, and even a Longhorn steer walking by my fence. I would never experience that in Laguna Niguel. I love nature.\n\nI no longer have immediate family in California, but I miss my friends back home. Making new friends has been the biggest challenge I've faced, but I keep trying. I've joined a volleyball league and play soccer and softball, where I meet people.\n\nI miss the world-class beaches in California; here we're pretty landlocked. I'm also a huge Angels fan. I grew up following the team, and Toshiba has a suite at Angel Stadium, so I used to attend many games. I also enjoyed attending LA Galaxy games. For now, I've adopted the University of Texas Longhorns for football and baseball, and I go to those games.\n\nWhile Texans are not required to file a state income tax return (only a federal one), property taxes appear to be significantly higher here. Properties themselves, however, are relatively inexpensive here. My property here is about twice the size of my home in California, and it was less expensive.\n\nOverall, it's still cheaper to live here, although Austin is one of the priciest cities in Texas. Gas is more affordable in Austin, but other living costs are comparable. I kept my same salary when I moved.\n\nHere in Dripping Springs, you see people with big belt buckles and cowboy boots. It's cool and culturally different from Orange County.\n\nDowntown Austin is one of the most vibrant and exciting places on the planet. It bustles with positive energy, with live music at pretty much every turn, and the University of Texas at Austin adds to that vibe.\n\nI'm very happy here and plan to stay permanently.",

Duarte (@michaeljduarte) January 12, 2026\n\nCharly Hill, who graduated from Miami in 2024 and has interned and freelanced at Bleacher Report, TNT Sports and NBC, joined as a sports content creator.\n\nI’m not typically active on Twitter, but that’s all about to change with my new role at the California Post as a Sports Content Creator\n\nSo excited to be a part of what’s shaping up to be an incredible year for California sports! pic.twitter.com/EOieGODH0b\n\n— charly d (@charlydyannhill) January 8, 2026\n\nBolch, who has covered UCLA athletics for the Los Angeles Times for more than a decade and spent 26 years at the paper overall, becomes the latest high-profile addition for the California Post, which has aggressively targeted established Southern California journalists to anchor its coverage.\n\nHis move follows the recent exits of former Los Angeles Times sports columnist Dylan Hernandez and Dodgers beat writer Jack Harris, who  announced last month they were joining the California Post.\n\nWith Bolch’s departure, the Los Angeles Times is now left with just nine full-time sports staff writers, a stark contraction for a paper that once boasted one of the deepest sports departments in the country.\n\nOutside of the editors, the Los Angeles Times sports staff is currently led by columnist Bill Plaschke, senior writers Bill Shaikin and Kevin Baxter, Thuc Nhi Nguyen and Broderick Turner on the Lakers, Ryan Kartje on USC, Gary Klein on the Rams, Sam Farmer on the Chargers and Eric Sondheimer on high schools.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times was slated to have the second-largest contingent of sports staffers covering the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo behind NBC, which is the broadcast home of the Olympics, before the pandemic. The plan at the time, according to sources, was to send 14 reporters and photographers to Tokyo to produce a separate daily color section, as it first did in 1984 when the games were held in Los Angeles. The Times will be covering next month’s Winter Games in Italy with one writer as Thuc Nhi Nguyen will be taking a break from the Lakers beat to cover the games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nWhen Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018, he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” Since the pandemic in 2020, however, the sports section has been reduced to the final four or five pages of the California section five days a week, with a standalone sports section of six to eight pages appearing only twice per week.\n\nDespite its statewide branding, the California Post's initial sports coverage will be centered squarely on Los Angeles, with a primary emphasis on the sports and teams the Los Angeles Times still covers in the Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA.\n\nHernandez and Harris will lead its MLB and Dodgers coverage, while Southern California News Group Lakers beat writer Khobi Price and longtime Lakers reporter Melissa Rohlin, who joined the Post last week, will anchor its NBA and Lakers coverage. Bonsignore will lead the NFL and Rams coverage while Bolch will lead college sports coverage, focusing on USC and UCLA.\n\nThe staffing losses at the Los Angeles Times come amid continued upheaval at the paper, which has faced newsroom cuts, buyouts and mounting uncertainty about its long-term investment in daily sports coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Post is not done hiring. Sources familiar with the startup’s plans say the outlet is continuing to pursue additional Times sports writers and other well-known local journalists before its launch on Jan. 26.",

Will you take the lump sum payment or the annuity payout?\n\nAccording to Mega Millions' website, those electing to take the annuity option get one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments.

He showed me their truck and the chain that they had broke,” Ruiz told KTLA.\n\nIn all, it cost the couple about $1,500 to replace the equipment that was stolen during the ordeal.\n\nStarbucks employee delivers coffee to L.A. deputy with hand-drawn pig on cup\n\n“When he showed me the pictures, I was super upset,’ Ruiz added. “These families are hard-working, and we have a lot of things going on with this immigration right now and it’s just sad to see that someone would rob them of what’s bringing their livelihood.”\n\nThe incident was reported to police and the search is on for the two suspects involved in the violent robbery.\n\n“I hope whoever did it, they catch them, but more importantly that the family is able to recover,” Ruiz said. “Not just the physical but the emotional trauma that they’re going to experience from this.”\n\nWhile the couple is already back to work just days after the harrowing incident, community members organized a GoFundMe to help them recoup their losses and provide for their family during the recovery.",

    "fullText": "Authorities in Westminster, a suburb in Orange County, are looking to spread awareness of vandalism at the Westminster Mall, which closed last October but has since become a hotbed of illicit activity.\n\nAccording to the Westminster Police Department, the mall has been boarded up since its closure; however, people still are finding ways to enter. One look inside shows that trespassers have trashed the mall, smashing glass storefronts, throwing leftover merchandise around and spray painting much of the interior.\n\nWestminster police say that, since the mall shut down, their department has received 402 calls for service for various crimes, including vandalism and trespassing. Individuals with arrest warrants have also been apprehended there, per WPD.\n\nA witness told KTLA that this weekend, they saw around 60 people in the mall at once — with no police or security in sight. They submitted pictures and video of the damaged mall but insisted they were “only there for footage” and did not participate in the vandalism.\n\nJust this past weekend, at least 30 people were arrested for vandalism, a Westminster Police Department spokesperson confirmed to KTLA. The spokesperson added that investigators believe the recent uptick in incidents may have to do with videos circulating online that show the vandalized interior.\n\nHowever, those videos are not an invitation to enter the mall, the spokesperson stated.\n\n“This has become a safety issue,” they said. “Anyone trespassing will get arrested.”",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're discussing the proposed tax on billionaires that's dividing the tech elite.",
    "fullText": "California's billionaires are at a crossroads.\n\nOne of the biggest business stories kicking off the year is the proposed wealth tax in California. The state's rich and powerful, worth more than $1 billion, would face a one-time 5% tax on their assets if the plan gets approved.\n\nThe proposal, which aims to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit, has prompted plenty of grumbling among the California elite.\n\nAs Business Insider first reported, some have already taken action, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nPage converted his secretive family office out of California in late December and incorporated it in Delaware, according to my colleague Hugh Langley's exclusive reporting. Page also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures. He lists principal office addresses outside of California for those entities.\n\nSeparately, an entity tied to both Brin and Page moved out of California at the end of 2025.\n\nThe timing of these moves is crucial. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. Hence, the rush to move assets before the end of the year.\n\nBrin and Page are two of the richest people on the planet, with a combined net worth north of half a trillion dollars, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang struck a very different tone. He said he's \"perfectly fine\" with the tax and gave no indication he plans to leave Silicon Valley, even if it costs him.\n\nOthers are more pessimistic. LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman called the proposal \"horrendous\" for innovation, warning that poorly designed wealth taxes don't raise reliable revenue — they push money and talent elsewhere.\n\nAlex Spiro, the celebrity lawyer who represents several billionaires, sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom last month warning that the tax would drive capital and innovation out of California.\n\nEarlier this month, White House AI Czar David Sacks predicted Austin would overtake San Francisco as the American tech hub. His social media post ricocheted throughout tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from traditionalists.\n\nWhere do you stand on the proposed billionaire's tax in California?

    "description": "Sergey Brin is joining his Google co-founder, Larry Page, in reducing ties to the state where they built their fortunes.",
    "fullText": "For nearly three decades, Google has been steeped in the lore of Silicon Valley.\n\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin, two Stanford University graduate students, created the search engine in 1998 and built the start-up out of a friend’s garage in Menlo Park, Calif. Over time, Google became a nearly $4 trillion juggernaut, helping to cement the Northern California region as the global epicenter of the internet industry.\n\nNow, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page are cutting some ties with the state where they made their fortunes.\n\nIn the 10 days before Christmas, an entity connected to Mr. Brin, 52, terminated or moved 15 California limited liability companies that oversee some of his business interests and investments out of the state, according to documents seen by The New York Times. Seven of the companies — including those that appear to manage one of Mr. Brin’s superyachts and his interest in a private air terminal at San Jose’s international airport — were converted into Nevada entities.\n\nMr. Brin is joining Mr. Page, 52, in reducing his California presence. More than 45 California limited liability companies associated with Mr. Page filed documents last month to either become inactive or move out of the state, according to state records. A trust with ties to Mr. Page also purchased a $71.9 million mansion in Miami’s Coconut Grove neighborhood this week, according to a deed seen by The Times.\n\nAnother entity jointly managed by Mr. Brin and Mr. Page moved out of California and to Nevada on Christmas Eve, according to a filing seen by The Times.\n\nThe Google founders’ shrinking connections to California underscore the impact of a potential ballot measure that would affect the state’s wealthiest residents. Proposed by a health care union, the measure calls for Californians worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax that would be equivalent of 5 percent of their assets. If the measure gains enough signatures to reach the state ballot in November and wins approval, it would retroactively apply to anyone who lived in the state as of Jan. 1 and they would have five years to pay it.\n\nThe potential wealth tax has already caused some California billionaires to establish more ties outside the state. Last month, the venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment firm in Miami. David Sacks, the tech investor and White House adviser on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.\n\nBut the actions of Mr. Brin and Mr. Page stand out because of their wealth — their combined net worths total more than $518 billion, as estimated by Forbes — and how closely identified they are with California. While both stepped down from day-to-day management of Google and its parent, Alphabet, in 2019, they remain on the board of the company and Mr. Brin has recently become more active in Google’s A.I. efforts.\n\nMr. Brin and Mr. Page still have connections to California, including homes across the state. It’s unclear how much time they will be spending in the state this year.\n\nA representative for Mr. Brin declined to comment. Google and representatives for Mr. Page did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on Mr. Page’s Miami home purchase and Business Insider reported on some details of the shifting of Mr. Page and Mr. Brin’s companies.\n\nThe ballot initiative, which was proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system, has elicited a broad spectrum of reactions.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has called the measure bad policy, arguing that it will lead billionaires to simply move to tax-friendlier states. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, has defended the initiative, drawing criticism from tech investors and entrepreneurs who are discussing funding a challenger to his seat.\n\nOthers have said the proposed tax could drive entrepreneurs and investors out of California, which could then stifle innovation. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and a Silicon Valley resident, said the measure was a “horrendous idea” that might force founders and executives to sell shares in companies that they run simply to fulfill the tax obligation.\n\n“Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue,” Mr. Hoffman posted on social media on Wednesday. Mr. Hoffman’s spokeswoman said he was not available for comment.\n\nJensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia and one of California’s wealthiest men, was among the few billionaires who publicly said they accepted the wealth tax. “We chose to live in Silicon Valley and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, adding that he was “perfectly fine” with it.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesman declined to comment.\n\nIn a statement, Suzanne Jimenez, chief of staff at Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, said an exodus of billionaires from California was overblown.\n\n“The overwhelming majority of billionaires have chosen to stay in California past the Jan. 1 deadline,” she said. “Only a very small percentage left before the deadline, despite weeks of Chicken Little talking points claiming a modest tax would trigger a mass departure.”\n\nKirsten Noyes and Georgia Gee contributed research.",

    "fullText": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said the state faces a $2.9 billion budget deficit this year, an amount significantly lower than what legislative budget analysts projected.\n\nThe deficit, though small, could still require cuts and means the Democratic governor doesn’t have money to advance new programs during his last year in office.\n\nIt’s the fourth year in a row that the nation’s most populous state faces a multibillion-dollar budget deficit. This year's shortfall comes despite growing revenues fueled by stock market gains and investments in artificial intelligence.\n\nNewsom's office outlined a behemoth $349 billion budget, though his proposal for how to spend all of that money is far from final. Lawmakers and the Democratic governor will spend the next several months fighting and negotiating over priorities — and cuts. Last year Democrats had to roll back their ambitious program to provide free health care to immigrants without legal status in the face of a $12 billion deficit.\n\n“This budget really is about an eye towards ensuring that we have a sustainable fiscal plan going forward,” Finance Director Joe Stephenshaw said during a Friday briefing.\n\nThis year, they will also face a $1.4 billion loss in federal funding after new federal policy changes to health care and food assistance programs for low-income people. Lawmakers have said repeatedly California is in no position to backfill that money. The budget doesn't fully address the federal funding loss.\n\nNewsom will try to safeguard some of the progressive policies that have defined his tenure as he considers a presidential run. But lawmakers have to consider the looming structural deficit that could climb to $22 billion the following year. Newsom can't seek a third term and will leave office in January.\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office in November projected California to face a $18 billion shortfall this year. Their estimate and Newsom's sometimes differ.\n\nNewsom's administration said some of the deficit was offset recently after the state racked in billion of dollars \n\nStill, State Controller Malia Cohen this week warned lawmakers that the state is already spending nearly $6 billion more than expected six months into the fiscal year. She urged them to take “a disciplined approach.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers said the problem is nothing new. They have little say in the budget process because Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers.\n\n“California families have to balance their budgets and make tough choices. The state government should be held to the same standards,” Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers said they're committed to addressing deficits.\n\n\"During these times of uncertainty, we must craft a responsible budget that prioritizes the safety and fiscal stability of California families,” state Senate President Pro Tempore Monique Limón said in a statement.\n\nNewsom on Thursday during his State of the State address said his budget will include “the most significant investments” in public education.\n\nHe plans to fully fund transitional kindergarten programs for all students, spend more than $27,000 per student next year and provide $1 billion to high-need schools. Based on a complex set of formulas, roughly 40% of the state's budget is required by California law to go to schools every year.\n\nNewsom also proposed to move the Department of Education into the executive branch. The state superintendent of public instruction is an elected position, and it's not immediately clear whether Newsom will ask voters to approve the change.\n\nHe doesn't propose any new funding to local governments to address homelessness. Last year, Newsom and lawmakers agreed to set aside $500 million for the local programs but it's not guaranteed.\n\nCounty officials worry the lack of new funding will hurt efforts to reduce homelessness. The programs are working, California State Association of Counties CEO Graham Knaus said, pointing to a 9% drop in unsheltered homelessness that Newsom touted earlier this week.\n\n“It would make no sense to then stop the most successful program that is doing that,” he said Friday.\n\nNewsom also calls for the state to rebuild its reserves after withdrawing roughly $12 billion in the last two years to solve budget problems.\n\nHe wants to deposit roughly $3 billion into the state’s rainy day fund, $4.5 billion into a special fund for economic emergencies and $4.1 billion in schools' reserve funds.\n\nHe also wants the state to use $3 billion to pay down debt.\n\nThe budget proposal includes $200 million to create a rebate program to make buying an electric car more affordable.\n\nThe money comes from revenues generated by the state’s cap-and-trade program and an air pollution regulation fund. The goal is to backfill federal tax incentives for electric vehicles that were slashed by Trump’s massive tax and spending cut bill.\n\nNewsom also wants to give more money to the state's Department of Justice to help the state fight the Trump administration's agenda. California has sued the administration more than 50 times since last year.",

    "fullText": "Receipts for a “secret menu” item and a separate order of French fries are among the evidence Glendale police shared from their investigation into an alleged counterfeit money scheme that targeted about a dozen In-N-Out Burger locations in Southern California.\n\nAuriona Lewis, 24, and Tatiyanna Foster, 26, both of Long Beach, face felony charges of counterfeiting and grand theft.\n\nThe investigation began Oct. 21, 2025, after an incident at a Glendale In-N-Out, police announced Friday, which detectives later connected to a broader pattern targeting In-N-Out locations throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties.\n\n“Investigators learned that the suspects had successfully victimized approximately a dozen restaurants by using counterfeit bills, resulting in financial losses and operational disruptions to the businesses,” police said.\n\nThe department released photos of counterfeit $100 bills and two receipts from Sept. 29, 2025. One was for a Flying Dutchman, a popular secret menu item consisting of two beef patties and two slices of cheese with no bun, totaling $5.93. It was paid for with a $100 bill, with the customer presumably pocketing the change.\n\nThe other receipt was for a $2.53 order of fries, also paid for with a $100 bill. Police also released In-N-Out security camera photos showing a suspect passing the bills to an employee.\n\nGlendale police financial crimes detectives, K-9 officers and U.S. Marshals arrested Lewis on Oct. 30 in Palmdale, where they said she had counterfeit bills matching those used in the Glendale case, along with numerous gift cards and receipts “believed to be connected to similar fraudulent activity.”\n\nFoster was arrested in December when she appeared at the Glendale Police Department.\n\n“This case underscores the importance of taking financial crimes seriously, regardless of dollar amount,” police said. “Counterfeit currency schemes directly impact local businesses and employees, and swift investigative action helped stop ongoing criminal activity and prevent further victimization.”\n\nThe department encouraged businesses to promptly report suspected counterfeit currency incidents.",

    "description": "A massive black bear caused thousands in damage while living beneath a California home for weeks before wildlife specialists finally removed the animal.",
    "fullText": "A 550-pound bear that had been living beneath a California man’s home for over a month has finally left after a bizarre strategy ended a long streak of failed removal attempts by state officials.\n\nThe male black bear was reportedly removed from the crawl space Tuesday after bear-removal experts from Tahoe traveled to the Altadena home. One team member crawled inside and fired paintballs filled with vegetable oil, wildlife organization BEAR League told Fox News Digital on Thursday.\n\nAccording to surveillance video, the large bear has been wedging itself in and out of a small crawl space beneath Ken Johnson’s house since late November. Johnson said that the animal caused extensive damage to his home, costing tens of thousands of dollars. It also created a dangerous, unlivable situation involving structural and gas line issues.\n\n\"Right after surviving the Eaton fire, I lost my job, and shortly after that the bear began tearing into the structure of my home,\" Johnson said in a GoFundMe page. \"I have video footage of it twisting gas pipes, which created an extremely dangerous situation and forced me to shut off my utilities just to stay safe.\"\n\nBear Remains Under California Home After Weeks Of Failed Removal Attempts\n\nThe bear eviction finally took place after Johnson contacted BEAR League, an organization that specializes in bear removal emergencies in Lake Tahoe, located seven hours north of Altadena.\n\nBEAR League told Fox News Digital on Thursday that the organization was \"pleased to have helped Ken Johnson with this bear.\"\n\n\"A Southern California homeowner had a large male bear living under his house for more than a month before reaching out to the BEAR League for help,\" the organization added in a post on Facebook on Thursday.\n\nBEAR League told Fox News Digital that the league used paintballs filled with vegetable oil that hit the bear in the backside. The wildlife rescue group reportedly finished the job in less than 20 minutes.\n\nWild Bear Makes 'Very Polite' Surprise Visit To California Zoo Before Returning To Forest\n\n\"After earlier removal attempts by state wildlife officials were unsuccessful, BEAR League first responders Scott and Dave traveled to the Los Angeles area to assist,\" the organization added. \"Scott, one of our most experienced responders, crawled beneath the home—fully aware the bear was still there—to get behind him and encourage him to exit through the crawl space opening.\"\n\nTo prevent the bear from denning in the crawl space again, the organization said it \"loaned electric unwelcome mats to give the homeowner time to make repairs and secure the crawl space to prevent another visit.\"\n\nAccording to social media footage posted by the organization, the mat worked just as designed, and the bear scurried away when it returned.\n\nBEAR League emphasized that residents should be cautious about having open crawl spaces, noting that properly securing them helps people coexist safely with wildlife.\n\n\"We remind those who live in bear country that a poorly-secured crawl space is an open invitation for a winter visitor like this bear,\" the league said to Fox News Digital. \"BEAR League responds multiple times per day at this time of year to evict bears from under homes in the Lake Tahoe region, and we’ve done so for 30 years without cost to the homeowner.  We work hard to educate people who share space with the bears that if humans take some very simple steps, they can live in harmony with the bears.\"\n\nTuesday’s success ended a long streak of failed eviction attempts by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which had been trying to remove the bear for over a month. At one point, a trap even caught the wrong bear. Efforts that included bait, noisemakers and even a trap that caught the wrong bear all failed.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "The Ohio Bobcats won 30 games across the past three seasons and one player pertinent to that success is headed elsewhere.\n\nOhio’s star wide receiver Chase Hendricks found his transfer portal destination, committing to California after three years as a Bobcat. In three seasons, Hendricks accumulated 1,616 yards and eight touchdowns on 122 receptions, with the majority of his production transpiring in 2024.\n\nHendricks led the entire MAC in receiving yards at 1,037 in a breakout 2025 campaign, while also checking in at second in the conference in receptions (71) and tied for fourth in receiving touchdowns (7). He served as the overwhelming No. 1 target for the 9-4 Bobcats, as the next closest teammate had 30 receptions and 419 yards receiving. 2025 marked Hendricks’ first year in the WR1 role, and it was clear from the opening drive in Week 1 that he’d be poised for a stellar season.\n\nHe produced 100 receiving yards in six of his first eight games this season and snagged 8+ receptions five times (maxing out at 10 vs. Northern Illinois and Eastern Michigan). Hendricks concluded his three-year Ohio stint with an 87-yard outing in a Frisco Bowl victory over UNLV, which represented the Bobcats’ sixth-straight bowl win.\n\nIn 2024, Hendricks was second on the team in receptions (40) and receiving yards (471) for a MAC champion Ohio team. He also earned playing time as a true freshman in 2023, recording 11 catches and 108 yards for a 10-3 Bobcat squad.\n\nThe St. Louis, MO native heads west to California where he joins a loaded Golden Bears receiving corps that features Rutgers transfer Ian Strong and 2025 FBS receptions leader Jacob De Jesus. As for Ohio, the Bobcats now must find a new No. 1 wide receiver — and 2026 will present the team’s fourth different receiving yards leader in four years. Ohio’s second-leading receiver Rodney Harris II is also in the transfer portal, leaving Dom Dorwart (11 receptions and 119 receiving yards in 2025) as the leading returner in production.",

    "description": "Critics warned a wealth tax in California would lead to a billionaire exodus. Florida says come on in, the water's warm.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page has quietly—or loudly—joined the billionaire exodus from California, shifting businesses east and dropping about $173 million on two ultra-luxury waterfront mansions in Miami’s Coconut Grove in a move that looks strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos’ relocation playbook. The timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look downright Bezos-ian.​\n\nIn late December and early January, The Wall Street Journal reported, Page snapped up two neighboring estates in Miami’s Coconut Grove, paying roughly $101.5 million for one waterfront compound and $71.9 million for another in an off‑market deal, for a combined outlay of about $173.4 million. One of the homes, previously listed for $135 million, spans 13 bedrooms and 15.5 bathrooms and sits directly on the water, while the second, bought from heiress Sloan Lindemann Barnett and her husband Roger Barnett, nearly doubled in value in less than five years.​\n\nThe purchases plant Page squarely inside one of Miami’s most exclusive enclaves, long favored by global elites seeking privacy, water access, and low‑key luxury. Local brokers say his splashy entry is part of a broader surge of high‑net‑worth Californians scouting Coconut Grove and other South Florida neighborhoods as they hedge against looming tax changes while upgrading to trophy waterfront properties. The real-estate purchases double as both a luxury retreat and a massive tax‑savings vehicle, with Page the most prominent of California’s ultrawealthy choosing to leave as state lawmakers are targeting fortunes like his with an aggressive wealth‑tax push.\n\nBehind the real-estate headlines, Page has been methodically severing his financial and legal ties to California ahead of a proposed wealth tax that targets residents worth more than $1 billion. Regulatory filings show he has moved his family office and several investment and holding entities out of the state, Business Insider reported, reincorporating key vehicles in Delaware and listing new business addresses in Florida.​\n\nThe New York Times previously reported Page had been telling associates he was considering Florida specifically because of a proposed ballot measure that would impose a 5% annual levy on the worldwide assets of billionaires domiciled in California. If passed and applied retroactively to residents as of Jan. 1, 2026, analysts estimate the tax could cost Page—currently ranked as the world’s second‑richest person—well over $10 billion.\n\n​​Some Silicon Valley executives, notably Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, warned such an outcome was possible, saying in late December founders would have to sell off parts of their companies to pay for “fraud, waste, and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.” California Rep. Ro Khanna responded to the Times‘ reporting that Page and Peter Thiel were looking to leave by flagging the story on X and saying, seemingly sarcastically in the style of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “I will miss them very much.”",

Johnson said the effort stalled after officials received instructions from Sacramento to pull back.\n\nAfter that, he threatened to sue the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for negligence and emotional distress.\n\nThe breakthrough, however, came when the BEAR League, a nonprofit based in Lake Tahoe, offered to help at no cost. The team, Johnson said, used similar methods to those employed by state agencies – paintball guns – but completed the job in about 10 minutes on Tuesday.\n\n“I couldn’t believe it was so fast,” Johnson said. “These guys went in, they crawled in behind him and, boom, he was out.”\n\nWhen the bear returned two nights later to climb back into the crawlspace, it encountered an electrified mat over the opening that gave it a small shock — so it took off. Only time will tell if it’s gone for good.\n\nJohnson described the removal as a “late Christmas gift.” He can now assess the damage the bear caused underneath his home, which includes a ruptured gas line.",

    "description": "Larry Page is leaving California ahead of the proposed billionaire's tax, and Jensen Huang is staying. It shows different appetites for risk.",
    "fullText": "It's a classic fight-or-flight response — with a billionaire's twist.\n\nA proposed wealth tax in California prompted the state's resident billionaires to consider whether they wanted to continue their residency if the one-time 5% tax is approved.\n\nTheir reactions, said CFP professional Don Hilario, who works with financial planning clients in California, boil down to risk tolerance.\n\nThe tax, as proposed, would only apply to assets in the state during the 2026 tax year. Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin moved assets out of California ahead of the January 1, 2026, deadline to avoid facing the tax, Business Insider first reported. Meanwhile, Nvidia's billionaire CEO Jensen Huang said he has \"not even thought about it once.\"\n\n\"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,\" Huang told Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow. \"I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\nHilario, whose financial planning clients include individuals in Big Tech, said that the lingering uncertainty of the tax can trigger a need for certainty and autonomy.\n\n\"People who want to have a greater sense of control will do the Larry Page route,\" he said, \"versus people who have the temperament to endure will take Jensen's route.\"\n\nHilario described a hypothetical scenario in which individuals with high net worths are considering purchasing a home. In a period where the economy and interest rates are uncertain, do you want to put the lion's share of your expenses toward the home in the event that rates will be higher in the future, or do you hold out and continue accumulating your wealth in the event that economic conditions improve?\n\n\"That's the same type of emotions that exist with this tax bill because the fear of not taking any action is unsettling,\" Hilario said.\n\nThe proposal, put forth by the union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West to offset potential budget cuts to healthcare and education, is far from being implemented — it would require 870,000 signatures to make it onto the November 2026 ballot.\n\nThe SEIU said in its proposal that the concentration of billionaire wealth in California makes the state \"uniquely positioned to address both the well-documented crisis of wealth inequality in the United States and the emerging and interrelated crises the state faces\" with the budget cuts.\n\nIn addition to Huang, Brin, and Page, other billionaires are voicing their opinions on the proposed wealth tax. LinkedIn's cofounder, Reid Hoffman, wrote in a post on X that the proposal has \"massive flaws.\"\n\n\"Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue,\" he said.\n\nAlex Spiro, an attorney who has previously represented billionaires, wrote in a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom that his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the tax were to become law. Hilario said that the significant uncertainty surrounding the proposal, including how assets will be valued and whether the tax would change over time, likely forced billionaires to decide how risk-averse they really are.\n\n\"I still think ultimately it's unclear. And I think when it's unclear, it'll make people, in this case, investors, be more cautious and defensive,\" Hilario said. \"And then a big part of it is, how do we respond emotionally? I think whether you're taking early action or enduring, you do want to gather information and avoid making a decision that would ultimately be irreversible.\"",

    "description": "The LLC moved as California's ultrarich weigh leaving ahead of a proposed tax on billionaires that would take effect retroactively starting January 1.",
    "fullText": "An entity tied to Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page moved out of California at the end of 2025, beating the deadline on a proposed wealth tax of the state's rich and powerful.\n\nT-Rex LLC, formed in 2006 and linked to Brin and Page, converted out of California into a Delaware LLC called T-Rex Holdings on December 24, 2025, according to a California filing reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPrior filings over the past 20 years listed Brin and Page as managers of the LLC at a Palo Alto address. In the conversion filing, T-Rex Holdings listed an address in Reno, Nevada, as its principal office, with Brin and Page both remaining managers.\n\nRepresentatives for Brin and Page didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe move comes as California's wealthiest residents are weighing whether to leave the state. A proposed ballot measure would make the roughly 200 California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion pay a one-time 5% tax. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. The measure attempts to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nEarlier this week, Business Insider first reported that Page severed ties with California in late December by converting his family office out of the state and incorporating it in Delaware. He has also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures.\n\nIt's unclear what the entity tied to Brin and Page does. The filing describes T-Rex Holdings as a \"management company.\" Like other ultrawealthy executives, Brin and Page have used LLCs as flexible vehicles to hold assets or manage investments, often with little public disclosure. The LLC's name may be a reference to Stan, a bronze T. rex statue that presides over Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nBrin, who cofounded Google with Page in 1998, is associated with several other entities in California, including the Sergey Brin Family Foundation and Bayshore Global Management, which acts as his family office. Filings do not show any other entity associated with Brin leaving California.\n\nPage and Brin are, respectively, the second and fourth-richest people on the planet, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Each has a net worth exceeding $250 billion.\n\nAfter stepping back from executive roles in 2019, the two have taken differing paths. Brin has returned to hands-on work at Google. Page is a controlling shareholder, but has remained outside the company's daily operations.\n\nIf the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November. If approved by voters, it will apply retroactively to the beginning of the year, meaning those who wish to avoid the tax would need to have been out of the state by the end of December 2025.\n\nCalifornia law determines residency based a variety of factors, including time spent in California and any substantial business dealings.\n\nA December 11 letter from celebrity attorney Alex Spiro to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, seen by Business Insider, urged the governor to stop the proposed tax: \"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"",

    "fullText": "State residents worth more than $1bn could face one-off, 5% tax to help fund education, food assistance and healthcare\n\nA battle is brewing in California over a plan to tax billionaires – with tech titans divided over whether they should pay up, or flee the state.\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\n“We chose to live in Silicon Valley,” Huang said. “And whatever taxes I guess they would like to apply, so be it.”\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with Google co-founder Larry Page, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they’re leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nThe tax proposal is being led by the labor union Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. If passed, the tax would retroactively apply to residents as of 1 January, and billionaires would have five years to pay it.\n\nThis means Huang would pay roughly $7bn and Page and Thiel would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $1.3bn, respectively, based on their current net worth.\n\n“What remains undeniable is the underlying unfairness of the current system,” Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for SEIU-UHW, said in an email. “Regular working people pay higher effective tax rates than the wealthiest Americans … Asking those who have benefited most from the economy to contribute more – particularly to stabilize health care systems under direct threat – is a reasonable step.”\n\nThe proposal is still in the beginning phases. Under California law, it needs to collect 874,641 signatures to qualify for the state ballot in November. It would also need to be signed by California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who has said he opposes the wealth tax.\n\n“You can’t isolate yourself from the 49 others,” Newsom said when asked about wealth taxes during the New York Times DealBook Summit last month. “We’re in a competitive environment.”\n\nThis puts Newsom at odds with Ro Khanna, the California representative who represents Silicon Valley and who has championed the idea of a wealth tax. Khanna says tech billionaires will likely stay in the state, despite a tax, because California is where the larger industry, innovation and talent pool are located. “A billionaire tax is good for American innovation,” Khanna said, adding that it would spread the wealth to other sectors.\n\nWhen Thiel indicated he was leaving California because of the proposed tax, Khanna posted to X: “I echo what FDR said with sarcasm of economic royalists when they threatened to leave, ‘I will miss them very much.’”\n\nThis is not California’s first billionaire exodus. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, famously departed for Texas in 2020, which stood to save him millions in taxes. He has also shifted several of his companies’ headquarters there. Most recently, in 2024, Musk announced he was moving SpaceX to Texas because of a California law that aimed to protect transgender children in schools. He called the law a “final straw”.\n\nOther tech billionaires have also decamped to Texas, which has no state income tax. Citing a better tax environment, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale moved to Austin in 2020, and Larry Ellison transitioned Oracle’s headquarters there in 2020 (he has since said he’s moving the company to Nashville). Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Technologies, has long lived in Texas.\n\nSacks made his announcement on 31 December, posting an image of the Texas flag on X and saying: “God bless Texas.” In a separate post the following day, Sacks wrote: “As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.”\n\nMusk, Lonsdale and Dell all responded with hearty welcomes. “No one will fight harder for the independent and free spirit of Texas than people who know [sic] it’s like when that’s taken away,” Musk wrote.\n\nPage has not publicly said where he’s moving, but in December companies associated with the Google co-founder filed documents to incorporate in Florida, according to the New York Times. Thiel, who owns a home in the Hollywood Hills, also seems to have set his sights on Florida. His investment firm, Thiel Capital, announced on 31 December that it had opened an office in Miami. The firm said Thiel has maintained a personal residence in the city since 2020.\n\nOn X, tech investors and other billionaires have blasted the proposed wealth tax. Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and former Facebook executive, said that without billionaires, California’s “budget deficit will only get bigger”, and Vinod Khosla, another investor, said that under the proposed tax, “California will lose its most important taxpayers and net off much worse”.\n\nSome have indicated they’d work to oust Khanna from Congress. Martin Casado, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote that Khanna had “devolved into an obnoxious jerk” and that his support of the wealth tax had alienated him from moderates. In response, Garry Tan, the CEO of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, wrote: “Time to primary him.”\n\nThe SEIU’s Jimenez said states like Massachusetts and Washington, which have other forms of wealth taxes, have seen billions of dollars raised to help the state. At the same time, she said, high-income residents have continued to see their portfolios grow. Jimenez added that the union is “heartened” by Huang’s recent comments and is hopeful that more billionaires will follow suit.\n\nAs for Huang, he said Nvidia is in Silicon Valley because that’s where the engineers are and he’s not worried about a billionaire tax.\n\n“Not this person,” Huang said. “This person is trying to build the future of AI.”\n\nRepresentatives for Page, Thiel, Sacks and Newsom did not return requests for comment.",

Knowing this can help residents and pet owners prepare in advance.\n\n“During this time, adult coyotes travel long distances in search of mates and food sources, resulting in more sightings,” the Huntington Beach Police Department posted Tuesday.\n\nA coyote attack on a toddler near Huntington Beach Pier made headlines in April 2022, not long after the typical mating season. A family was out by the pier around 9:45 p.m. when the 2-year-old girl was attacked.\n\nThe coyote bit the girl and knocked her down, leaving her with injuries described as non-life-threatening. Huntington Beach police officers were called to the scene, where they found two coyotes nearby and shot them both.\n\nThat same year, the city issued its Coyote Management Plan to help the community safely coexist with urban coyotes.\n\nCoyotes, which are native to California, eat a broad range of small animals, including mice, rats and gophers. “Rodents make up a majority of their diet. In the process, they control the population sizes of these animals, many of which are considered pests to humans,” the city’s plan states.\n\nUnfortunately, urban coyotes are also known to go after small pets or even children and can be attracted into neighborhoods by pet food, unsecured compost or trash, and fallen fruit.\n\nCut back vegetation that may create hiding places and shelters.\n\nQuickly harvest ripe or fallen fruit and vegetables.\n\nPick up trash and keep lids closed.\n\nKeep garbage inside a garage or secure building until pickup day.\n\nPet owners are urged not to leave small dogs outside unattended, as they may be seen as potential prey.\n\n“It is important to either keep dogs on a six-foot-long or shorter leash when outdoors or to stay within six feet of them when on your property. Coyotes may view a dog on a leash longer than six feet as an unattended pet,” officials said.\n\nProtect cats and small dogs from coyotes:\n\nWhen outside, accompany them or keep them on a leash or harness.\n\n“People who feed feral cats are often concerned that coyotes might prey on the cats,” officials said. “These concerns are well-founded, as coyotes can be attracted to outdoor pet food.”\n\nMore information, including a checklist to make your home uninviting to coyotes, is available on the Coyote Management Plan.",

    "fullText": "I've visited California wine country several times over the past couple of years, including many trips to the iconic Napa Valley.\n\nAnd although I definitely recommend a trip to Napa, there's another nearby wine region that I find myself returning to even more often: Sonoma.\n\nMore than just the city of Sonoma, the entire county feels like its own world. With rolling vineyards, rugged beaches, and redwood forests, it offers so much more than wine alone. Here's why this region stole my heart.\n\nThe region offers everything from relaxed, walk-in spots to high-end tasting rooms with incredible service and excellent wines.\n\nSonoma is also home to one of the oldest premium wineries in California, Buena Vista Winery. Here, I've enjoyed walking the historic grounds, seeing the old vines, and learning some history while I sip.\n\nBeyond great wine, Sonoma also offers unique tasting experiences. At the historic Bartholomew Estate Winery, for example, guests can enjoy a tasting after horseback riding through the vineyards.\n\nI had a similar adventure at Chalk Hill Winery in Healdsburg, where I paired my tasting with a Hummer ride throughout the estate.\n\nSonoma County is home to a diverse range of landscapes, including vineyards, redwood forests, rivers, and beaches.\n\nI love driving along the dramatic coastline and stopping to hike, or spending a few hours on the sand at Sonoma Coast State Park.\n\nIn a single day, I can sip wine, stroll under redwoods, and watch the sun set over the Pacific. In my experience, there aren't many other places where that's possible.\n\nSeveral smaller towns make up Sonoma County, and many of them feel like they were plucked straight from a Hallmark movie.\n\nI love walking and biking through Sonoma's quiet city streets, and grabbing coffee or fish tacos in Bodega Bay.\n\nI also enjoy celebrating the holidays on the festive square in Healdsburg, and wandering around Guerneville, tucked under the majestic redwoods.\n\nEach town has its own personality, and exploring them feels like moving through different little worlds, all connected by the same relaxed, welcoming energy that makes Sonoma so special.\n\nNapa is a popular travel destination, and with reservations recommended at many tasting rooms and restaurants, planning is key.\n\nIn Sonoma County, however, visitors don't always need to plan as far in advance, as many restaurants and wineries accept walk-ins.\n\nOn a recent trip, I visited Gracianna Winery, Overshine Wine Co., Korbel Winery, and Sonoma Coast Vineyards — none of which required a reservation. Each place offered a distinct experience and insight into the local wine scene.",

    "description": "This past weekend has seen a new spate of Pokémon TCG-related crimes, with over $300,000 worth of rare cards stolen in two seperate incidents in Southern California. In one, thieves broke into a trading card store and smashed display cases, while a second incident saw a collector held up at gunpoint for a briefcase of rare cards.\nTrading card store Simi Sportscards in the Simi Valley was the target of a break-in early Sunday morning, KTLA reports, with CCTV footage showing a group of at least five thieves smashing display cases to steal the cards inside. Store owner Jake Miller says the group stole rare sports trading cards and valuable Pokémon TCG cards after sawing through the front door. He estimates the break-in will cost the store over $50,000 in repairs, lost merchandise, and security upgrades.",

    "fullText": "Shasta Lake, the largest reservoir in California, rose more than 30 feet over the past two weeks as a series of winter storms pounded the state, according to state data.\n\nThe heavy inflow over the holidays, with Shasta Lake rising 10 feet alone between Friday and Monday, pushed water levels at the sprawling Northern California reservoir to nearly 80% of capacity, which is well above what it typically holds this early in the rainy season. And the runoff is still coming in, albeit at a slower rate.\n\nCalifornia reservoir levels: Charts show water supply across the state\n\nWhile winter is still young and California's water picture won't be clear for months, the recent replenishment of Shasta Lake, as well as other major reservoirs, is welcome news for cities and farms across the state, which rely on the water that fills these giant storage facilities between fall and spring.\n\n\"Reservoirs on the whole are running ahead of average, which is good,\" said Michael Anderson, state climatologist at the California Department of Water Resources, in a report Tuesday to the State Water Resources Control Board.\n\nPrior to the holidays, water managers were getting nervous after a mostly dry start to the state's peak wet season, which runs from December to March. But starting just before Christmas, an extremely wet pattern locked in, bringing more than a foot of rain and several feet of snow to parts of California over a two-week period.\n\n\"Right around the Christmas holiday, we had over 100 hours of atmospheric river conditions in the state,\" Anderson said.\n\nAs a result, water storage at Shasta Lake climbed to 132% of average for the date, as of Monday. Storage at Lake Oroville, the state's second-largest reservoir, rose to 135% of average. Storage at Trinity Lake, the state's third-largest reservoir, hit 137% of average.\n\nHetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite, which is San Francisco's primary storage facility, meanwhile, held 130% of the water it typically holds on this date.\n\nMany reservoirs have been making releases to ensure adequate space for the lingering precipitation and continuing runoff. Shasta Lake's waters were about 35 feet below the rim of the reservoir.\n\n\"We are on the receding limb of inflows with these latest systems,\" said Levi Johnson, an operations manager at the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages Shasta Lake. \"This will be a dynamic operation in terms of what kind of releases we have.\"\n\nThe storms appear to be mostly on their way out. The National Weather Service is forecasting dry conditions for at least the next two weeks.\n\nWhile California's water picture remains strong, water managers will be watching to see how long it is before the next rain and snow arrives and whether it's enough to maintain robust reservoir storage.\n\nAnother factor that water managers are monitoring is snowfall in the state's far north. While California's total snowpack stands at 90% of average for the date, the northern Sierra and southern Cascades are at just 67%.\n\nSnow is important, particularly in Northern California where the state's biggest reservoirs are located, because it melts and provides a source of water for reservoirs after the rainy season ends.\n\n\"We've had a lot more rain than snow,\" Anderson said.\n\nThis article originally published at California's largest reservoir surges 30 feet after recent storms.",

    "description": "The Nvidia CEO is the eighth-wealthiest person in the world and could see an $8 billion levy should the 5% California wealth tax come to pass.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang seems like he's not losing sleep over California's proposed wealth tax.\n\nWhen Bloomberg TV's Ed Ludlow asked Huang about California's proposed 5% billionaire wealth tax in an interview that aired on Tuesday, Huang said that the potential levy hasn't crossed his mind once and that he is \"trying to build the future of AI.\"\n\n\"I've got to tell you, I have not even thought about it once,\" Huang told Ludlow. \"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it. I'm perfectly fine with it.\"\n\n\"We work in Silicon Valley because that's where the talent pool is,\" Huang added.\n\nHuang is the eighth-wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes, which estimated his net worth at approximately $162.6 billion as of January 6. Most of Huang's wealth comes from his around 3% stake in Nvidia, which just showed off its new Vera Rubin chips at the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nBased on his net worth as reported by Forbes, a 5% tax on his total wealth would amount to more than $8 billion, to be paid over five years, according to the proposed plan.\n\nThe California wealth tax was proposed by the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West in order to offset anticipated budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance.\n\nA wealth tax is different from an income tax and is a levy on an individual's entire net worth instead of annual income. The union estimates that the one-time tax will bring in $100 billion over five years for the state and apply to the around 200 billionaires who are residents of California.\n\nThe proposal is still very far from reality and would need 870,000 signatures to even make it to the ballot in November 2026, where it would then be voted on or rejected by California voters.\n\nBillionaires from Palmer Luckey to David Sacks have already voiced their full-throated disapproval.\n\nAccording to filings viewed by Business Insider, Larry Page, the Google cofounder, converted many of his assets from California to Delaware in December to derisk them from the potential wealth tax. His departure meets an end-of-2025 deadline, since the tax, if passed, would only apply to billionaires who are still residents of California on January 1, 2026.\n\nCelebrity attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of his wealthy clients and warned that they would \"permanently relocate\" if the California billionaire tax comes to pass.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "The Google cofounder has severed ties between California and several of his business entities, including his family office.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Larry Page is peacing out of California.\n\nThe Google cofounder has cut ties between California and many of his assets that risked exposing him to a proposed new wealth tax in the state, meeting an end-of-2025 deadline, according to filings reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nPage's family office, Koop, was converted out of California in late December and incorporated in Delaware, per filings with both states. Page converted several other entities to Delaware, including Flu Lab LLC — a vehicle he has used to fund research on tackling influenza and lists its principal office address in Nevada — and another entity named One Aero, which has funded his flying car ventures and lists its principal office address in Florida.\n\nA filing was also made to convert Dynatomics, LLC from California to Delaware with a new principal address in Keller, Texas. Page launched Dynatomics, a new startup focused on applying AI to aircraft manufacturing, in 2023, Business Insider previously reported. A source close to Page said that the team, run by Chris Anderson, continues to work out of California.\n\nAnderson and representatives for Page's family office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe New York Times reported in December that Page had told people he was considering moving to Florida because of a proposed ballot measure that would tax the state's wealthiest residents. The proposal, if passed successfully, would mean that any California resident worth more than $1 billion would be taxed 5% of their assets.\n\nUnder California law, residency is determined by the nature of a person's ties to the state, with factors such as the time spent in the state and the maintenance of substantial business ties taken into account. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nA source close to Page said the Google cofounder had already left the state. Whether Page's move is temporary could not be learned.\n\nPage is ranked the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nBesides his family office and funding vehicles, Page converted out an LLC that Business Insider previously identified as being used to purchase islands in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, from California to Delaware, with a new address listed in Florida.\n\nA separate LLC Page used to purchase an Island in Fiji was also converted out to Delaware.\n\nPage's wife, the scientist Lucinda Southworth, founded a marine-conservation charity named Oceankind. Filings show that Oceankind converted out of California to Delaware in December.\n\nDelaware has become a popular state for businesses to incorporate due to its favorable tax structure, privacy, and its home to a court system specifically designed to handle corporate disputes. The state does not require LLCs to disclose the names and addresses of directors when incorporating, providing them with an extra layer of privacy.\n\nPrivacy is especially important to Page, whose family office is shrouded in a level of secrecy unparalleled by most and carefully managed by its CEO, Wayne Osborne.\n\nCristina Rosado, an attorney who handles many of Page and Southworth's assets, signed several of the California filings.\n\nPage incorporated three entities in Florida last year, as previously reported by The New York Times. A Koop LLC was incorporated in Florida in January 2025, per filings reviewed by Business Insider. It could not be confirmed if it belongs to Page.\n\nThe California billionaire tax proposal faced some opposition from leaders in venture capital and politics. In a post on X in December, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said the proposed measure would mean California would lose its most important taxpayers and \"net off much worse.\"\n\n\"Long term damage unless legislature bans wealth taxes,\" he added. \"Easier to equalize taxes on work income and capital gains at the national level.\n\nMatt Mahan, Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, on Monday described the tax as \"a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy.\"\n\nWhite House AI czar David Sacks has criticized the proposal and said it will backfire. He has also said he believes Miami and Austin will overtake New York and San Francisco for finance and tech, respectively. He announced this month that his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, had opened an office in Austin.\n\nLast month, celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro wrote a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, warning that the proposed billionaire tax would \"trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave something to share?

California insurance provider CSAA — part AAA’s insurance company — stated they discovered a “substantial increase in hazards” piling around her home. But they allegedly used aerial images from a drone to find it.\n\n“She said they [CSAA] flew a drone over the home,” Van Kuren told CBS Sacramento in 2024 of her call with a customer service representative. “It almost feels like someone’s looking in your windows, you know, when they tell you that they flew a drone over your home and looked at it.

If your home insurance company says they want to cut your insurance over concerns, here’s what you need to know.\n\nIn an increasing number of cases, insurance companies are using eyes in the skies to not only determine the condition of insured homes, but to assess damages once a natural disaster comes through.\n\nSince then, drones are becoming increasingly popular for insurance applications. Information technology consultant Cognizant says drones can improve efficiency and create additional accuracy, lead to closing claims faster, and improve safety for their employees.\n\nUsing a drone for an insurance inspection is not illegal in the State of California. ABC 7 San Francisco notes that unless you are using a drone to be a “Peeping Tom,” it’s legal to fly over homes and take videos.

    "fullText": "Shortly after earning my Bachelor's degree, I did what any confused 21-year-old would do: I moved to be with a partner.\n\nThe decision surprised a lot of people in my life. My dad raised his eyebrows at my choice to move for love and to make Texas my home.\n\nAfter all, I'd always dreamed of moving to New York, where I'd launch my writing career.\n\nHowever, moving to Texas seemed like a good option at the time. It's where my long-distance partner was living and working, and I was fresh out of college and eager to leave my California hometown.\n\nLooking back now, I was leaning on a romanticized version of what moving would mean — a fresh start and a deepening of our LDR — instead of thinking about what I really wanted.\n\nI arrived in northern Texas during a mid-summer nightmare of humidity. I couldn't walk outside without feeling like I'd just entered a sauna — a sharp contrast to California's dry heat.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I tried to find community and make living here work, convincing myself I'd adjust if I just put in enough effort.\n\nBut I had a tough time finding things to do in my new suburb. Quiet nights and weekends left me daydreaming about New York City and its seemingly endless array of activities and events even more.\n\nCrucially, I also found it incredibly difficult to meet anyone who felt similar to me.\n\nMy Dallas suburb felt much more conservative than my California hometown, and a lot of the people in our neighborhood were avid churchgoers, whereas I'm not religious.\n\nAround this time, too, I was coming to terms with the fact that I also liked women romantically. I struggled to find the kinds of queer spaces that seemed more plentiful in larger cities and bluer states.\n\nAs much as I tried to appreciate the mountainless views and endless selection of barbecue, I struggled to connect with my new town — and I couldn't stop thinking about the life I wanted in New York.\n\nSix months in, I took a quick trip back to California to visit my dad.\n\nTaking some time away from Texas made me confront the truth: I couldn't stay there anymore.\n\nThroughout my entire time in the state, I'd been daydreaming about packing up my things and living in New York City. My partner, on the other hand, wanted life in the country, and we just ended up not being compatible.\n\nThe Lone Star State helped bring all of these realizations to light.\n\nI knew that if I had chosen to stay, I'd continue to feel like a stranger in my own life. I realized that I'd rather take on the \"sunk cost\" of moving than stay in a place and relationship that didn't suit me.\n\nI learned a lot about myself during this time — including the fact that, maybe unsurprisingly, a suburb in northern Texas was not a great long-term fit for me. The biggest lesson I learned, though, was never to give up my own hopes and dreams for the sake of a relationship.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Moving for a partner can work for some people, but at 21, I learned the importance of making life decisions with my own wants and needs in mind.\n\nNow, almost a decade later, I'm writing this from my New York City apartment. I'm in a city where I've found my purpose, the love of my life, and most importantly, happiness.\n\nLeaving Texas turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.",

    "fullText": "California’s East Bay got a shock on the morning of New Year’s Eve when a sleek black Chevrolet Camaro turned a routine patrol on Interstate 580 into something out of a spy movie. At around 8:20 in the morning, officers from the California Highway Patrol spotted a motorist barreling down the highway at speeds well over 100 miles per hour. What happened next has police scratching their heads and asking the public for help identifying the driver and vehicle involved.\n\nFor law enforcement, Interstate 580 can be a daily blur of commuters and big rigs. On this day, though, it was the scene of a high-speed enigma. It’s not a simple case of a Camaro outrunning the officers pursuing it; it also seemed to make its identity vanish. According to the CHP, the vehicle’s license plate went “black” or “turned off” during the chase, depriving authorities of a critical tool used to track down fleeing drivers.\n\nThis odd twist in an otherwise familiar story of speeding and evasion has raised more questions than answers. Social media users wondered if the Camaro was fitted with a so-called digital license plate that can be manipulated remotely.\n\nCalifornia has been at the forefront of experimenting with electronic plates, which are legal when properly registered and used within regulations. Yet the idea that such tech could be exploited to intentionally thwart police tracking naturally grabbed headlines and sparked speculation about potential misuse.\n\nThe CHP’s Dublin area office released a description of the plate itself, noting it was black with yellow or white lettering before it went dark. That limited detail underscores just how little investigators know about the driver or the exact nature of the disappearing tag technology.\n\nLaw enforcement has stopped short of calling it a “hack,” and there’s no indication yet that the plate is illegal in and of itself. But the implication that someone equipped a car with the ability to cloak its identity mid-pursuit is enough to make any patrol vet raise an eyebrow.\n\nTo be clear, this was not a routine stop that turned sour. The Camaro was engaged in what police describe as an extended attempt to flee contact, topping triple-digit speeds as it weaved along the highway. Officials attempted to initiate a traffic stop in the early morning commute, but as so often happens in high-speed chase situations, the driver chose flight over compliance. The report is that the black Camaro is fond of doing over 100 mph.\n\nIn the aftermath, the CHP has appealed directly to the public for tips. Their Facebook post about the incident asked anyone with information to reach out to investigators at the Dublin office. Typically, such pleas signal that law enforcement has not yet identified the suspect or vehicle owner.\n\nIn this case, their language left little doubt that the chase ended with the Camaro slipping out of their grasp. One comment made fun of the authorities, saying, “if you got gapped, you can just say that bro, no shame here.” Most of the comments don’t seem to care:\n\n“Was it a T-top model with a \"screaming chicken\" painted on the hood? Was the diver wearing a cowboy hat and a dark mustache? Oh Camaro... Somehow, I read Trans-AM.”\n\n“I didn’t see nothing, hear nothing, know nothing….”\n\n“Are we on payroll now? They are calling in the Street Detectives.”\n\nIt’s not the first time that high-performance cars have outpaced police vehicles or used unconventional methods to escape. Across the country, high-speed pursuits involving Camaros, Mustangs, and other muscle cars are regular entries in police logs. Some end with arrests, others with crashes.\n\nBut adding technology that directly interferes with standard identification tools marks a new wrinkle, and one that could force legislators and law enforcement agencies to rethink how they monitor and manage such devices.\n\nThe incident also highlights the challenge of pursuing suspects on busy freeways. Officers must balance the need to enforce the law with the safety of other motorists. High-speed chases are inherently dangerous, and when the fleeing vehicle seems to have tools to evade detection, the stakes climb even higher.\n\nAt this point, the Camaro and its driver are still at large. The CHP is seeking help from anyone who witnessed the event or may have seen the vehicle before or after the chase. It remains unclear whether further evidence will surface, but this curious combination of muscle car speed and mysterious plate behavior has already captured the public’s imagination. One of the comments under the FB post was quite lengthy:\n\n“Quit asking the public to do your dirty work… we don’t care… and to be quite honest, the police try to say social media is the best thing that ever happened to law-enforcement because the criminals just snitch on themselves. Well, you guys are letting us know how you do everything … No one knew how you guys did what you did… it is your job to catch us and our job not to get caught. Freedom of speech is crazy, isn’t it?”\n\nIf you saw something that morning on I-580 or know more about the technology that might let a license plate blink out like a cartoon disappearing act, authorities want to hear from you. Anyone with information is urged to contact the CHP Dublin Area Office.",

(AP) — Heavy rain and high tides believed to be the most severe in two decades caused flooding in parts of Northern California on Saturday, prompting road closures and rescues of people trapped in cars.\n\nRoadways through a 15-mile (24-kilometer) stretch from the Sausalito area to San Rafael were flooded after a downpour coincided with record-breaking “ King Tides,” Marin County Sheriff's Sgt.

Some people kayaked along swamped streets, while others waded through water above their knees.\n\nA flood warning was in place for the San Francisco area until 2 p.m. Saturday and an advisory until 2 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, and repeated rounds of rain were expected throughout the state on Sunday and Monday.\n\nTo the south in Santa Barbara County, roads were closed due to flooding and a key highway was blocked near Goleta due to a series of mudslides. A man died after he was swept into a creek during the storm, the county sheriff’s office said.\n\nKing Tides occur when the sun, moon and Earth are in alignment and the moon is in its closest position to the Earth, creating a stronger gravitational pull.",

    "description": "Ultrawealthy tech investors like David Sacks and Peter Thiel are weighing their options ahead of California's proposed billionaire wealth tax.",
    "fullText": "Is Miami destined to be the new Wall Street, and Austin the next Silicon Valley? \"All-in\" podcaster and White House AI czar David Sacks thinks so.\n\nSacks kicked off a New Year's social media debate by declaring that Miami will overtake New York as the nation's financial capital — and that Austin is poised to replace San Francisco as the center of tech.\n\n\"As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital,\" Sacks wrote in a January 1 post on X that ricocheted through tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from defenders of the old hubs.\n\nLinda Yaccarino, the former CEO of X, responded to Sacks with the word \"Miami\" along with a fire emoji.\n\nGarry Tan, who runs Y Combinator, the influential startup accelerator behind Airbnb, Stripe, and Dropbox, weighed in, saying the firm hasn't expanded beyond San Francisco because founders are still much more likely to build successful, product-market-fit unicorns in the region.\n\nWe haven’t done it yet because it is much more likely that people create successful PMF unicorns staying in SF Bay Area at a rate of 2.5x more\n\nNYC is about 2x\n\nTan recently said he would consider opening an Austin outpost if California moves forward with a proposed billionaire tax. The ballot measure would impose a one-time 5% levy on California residents with assets exceeding $1 billion and could go before voters in November if it qualifies.\n\nSacks urged Tan to reconsider, arguing that a Y Combinator outpost in Austin could become a \"self-fulfilling prophecy.\" \"If YC and others support Austin, it will be successful,\" Sacks said.\n\nMusk replied simply, \"Yes.\" The Pittsburgh-based venture capitalist Brandon Brooks said an Austin outpost \"would be the biggest shift for the startup ecosystem in history.\"\n\nSacks is a venture capitalist, podcaster, and one of the earliest members of the so-called \"PayPal mafia,\" a group of PayPal employees who went on to positions of influence and power in Silicon Valley. His profile surged after he was appointed the Trump administration's artificial intelligence and crypto czar.\n\nSacks' own firm is already on the move. Craft Ventures said it opened an Austin office in December, with Sacks relocating to the city while the firm maintains offices in New York and San Francisco. Fellow Texans including Elon Musk, Michael Dell, and Joe Lonsdale, one of the cofounders of Palantir, welcomed him with posts.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe argument Sacks is making isn't new (one online poster on X even replied with a popular \"Grand Theft Auto\" video game meme showing the character saying \"here we go again.\")\n\nThe debate flared during the pandemic, when remote work drove waves of coastal workers to Texas and Florida in search of more space, lower taxes, and a cheaper cost of living. Austin, in particular, ascended as companies like Tesla and Oracle moved into the region, and giants like Google and Facebook expanded their office footprints.\n\nSacks has also been making the case that high taxes, heavy regulation, and a leftward political turn are driving talent and capital out of legacy power centers like San Francisco and New York.\n\nSacks posted his prediction the same day Zohran Mamdani was inaugurated as New York City's mayor, making history as the first socialist mayor to hold the office.\n\nLonsdale's venture firm, 8VC, moved from San Francisco to Austin in 2020. Lonsdale tweeted at the time that the firm was moving for several reasons, among them: \"Austin is far more tolerant of ideological diversity than SF.\"\n\nThe hype hasn't fully held. Some tech workers told Business Insider they later left or tried to leave Austin, citing brutal heat, traffic, overcrowding, and a tech scene that felt thinner than advertised.\n\nMeanwhile, Thiel Capital is expanding in Miami as California's proposed wealth tax looms.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thiel Capital, the private investment firm founded by the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel said it has opened a new office in Miami.\n\nIf the proposal passes, the tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

The source claimed there were no signs of foul play and no drug paraphernalia found at the scene.\n\nHotel staff performed CPR and called for an ambulance, but paramedics confirmed the 34-year-old was unresponsive and pronounced dead on the scene. A cause of death had not been determined as of Friday morning.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department is now handling the death investigation and a medical examiner is expected to determine her cause of death.\n\nVictoria was the daughter of Tommy, 79, and his second wife, Kimberlea Cloughley. The actor and director is known for starring in films including No Country for Old Men, Men In Black and The Fugitive.\n\nVictoria followed in her father’s footsteps at a young age, appearing in Men In Black II.

    "fullText": "The Sussexes’ PR problems are back in the spotlight as 2025 draws to a close. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have faced steady blowback around launches and messaging. Now, a fresh staffing shake-up is raising questions about their public image team.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess have built a California-based brand across media and charity work. However, insiders now describe their communications operation as hard to run. Consequently, the search for the right publicist is reportedly becoming more difficult.\n\nAs per Rob Shuter’s Substack report dated December 31, 2025, a senior U.S. publicist resigned. It says Meredith Maines quit after about 10 months in the role. A former staffer said, “The job isn’t hard because of the press,” adding, “It’s hard because of the principals.” The person claimed, “Harry and Meghan are impossible to satisfy.” They also alleged that their “expectations constantly shift.”\n\nMeanwhile, another insider said in the report that top American PR firms are declining the account. The person claimed, “They’re difficult and, frankly, cheap.” The source argued that budgets are a sticking point for Sussex‘s PR strategy. The person said, “Kardashians and Beyoncé spend a fortune on PR.” However, they claimed the couple expects the same results “for a fraction of the budget.”\n\nWith U.S. options narrowing, the report says London strategist Liam Maguire may step up. An insider said they are “cutting costs by eliminating a senior American salary.” Still, the person warned that running a U.S. operation from London brings “huge challenges.” They pointed to time zone strain and “burnout risks.”\n\nIn the Substack report, staffers also described the workplace mood as intense. One source said, “The office is high pressure, constantly shifting.” They added that it can hit “DEFCON 1 over minor issues.” Another insider said, “A competent PR can survive bad headlines.” However, they added, “They can’t survive clients who won’t listen.”\n\nFor now, the claims keep Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s PR issues in a familiar loop. If staffing stabilizes, messaging may settle, too. If it does not, the churn could stay part of the story in 2026.\n\nThe post Royal Couple ‘Impossible To Satisfy’ Amid PR Nightmare — Source appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "Rain poured down on the iconic Rose Parade on Thursday for the first time in 20 years, as flood warnings and evacuation orders in Southern California joined snow squalls and frigid temperatures in the country's midsection to mark the first day of 2026.\n\nMarching bands, floats and throngs of spectators were soaked by one to two inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) of New Year’s Day rain at the 137th Rose Parade in Pasadena. The mercury stood at a chilly 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14.4 degrees Celsius) at the 8 a.m. start of the parade.\n\nAcross the country, in New York City, hats and gloves were as necessary as noisemakers at the city's New Year's Eve ball drop, where temperatures near freezing appeared to be the coldest in 10 years.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people gather along the nearly six-mile (10-kilometer) route in Pasadena, where the two-hour parade kicked off. Millions more watch on national television. Organizers at the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, the group that organizes the parade ahead of the Rose Bowl college football game, said they made only small changes to accommodate the weather, such as the tops being up on convertibles carrying grand marshal Earvin “Magic” Johnson and other VIPs.\n\nRain forecasts for the Rose Parade, which had been dry for 20 years, grew all week. On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for all California counties and a coastal flood advisory through Sunday afternoon along much of the Pacific Coast near San Francisco.\n\nMeanwhile, residents in the areas hit hardest by last year's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires were under evacuation warnings.\n\nIn New York City, the sun came out ahead of Mayor Zohran Mamdani's inaugural celebration, but other areas of the Northeast and Midwest were hit by an Alberta clipper storm and trailing Arctic front that brought snow squalls and high winds.\n\nConditions varied widely — from snow showers to heavier squalls — from Wisconsin through northern Illinois and Michigan and into northern New Jersey, southeastern New York and New England.\n\nAbout a quarter of flights were delayed out of both San Diego International Airport and Boston Logan, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.",

    "description": "California's DMV said some legal immigrants had been issued Real IDs that did not expire at the same time as their authorization to remain in the country.",
    "fullText": "The California Department of Motor Vehicles said this week that approximately 325,000 Californians will be required to replace their Real ID licenses because of a software error.\n\nIn the coming weeks, DMV officials said, about 1.5% of those holding Real IDs will be notified that they “need to take action” to “ensure continued compliance with federal REAL ID regulations.”\n\n“The DMV is informing affected individuals of the steps they need to take,” officials said in a news release issued Wednesday. Fees associated with reissuing the IDS will be waived for those affected.\n\nDMV officials said the problem was discovered after a review of technology systems revealed that some legal immigrants had been issued Real IDs that did not expire at the same time as their authorization to remain in the country.\n\nThe Real ID Act was signed into law in 2005 and established security standards for state-issued IDs for things like boarding planes. But implementation was repeatedly delayed, and the requirement finally went into effect in May of 2025. DMV officials said they discovered that a “small subset” of Real IDs issued to lawful permanent residents “applied the standard credential renewal interval in some cases, instead of the expiration of a REAL ID holder’s authorized stay.”\n\n“We proactively reviewed our records, identified a legacy system issue from 2006, and are notifying impacted customers with clear guidance on how to maintain a valid California-issued credential,” DMV Director Steve Gordon said. “For nearly 99% of REAL ID holders, no action is required. The DMV remains committed to serving all Californians and ensuring REAL ID credentials meet federal standards.”\n\nOfficials said the problem came about because of “legacy coding from 2006.” But the release added that all those who had been issued Real IDs received them only after the federal system had verified their lawful presence in the country, and that no one who was undocumented got one.\n\nA.

    "description": "Thiel Capital, founded by, billionaire Peter Thiel, said it opened a new office in Miami.",
    "fullText": "Thiel Capital is expanding in Miami.\n\nOn Wednesday, the private investment firm founded by the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel said it has opened a new office in Miami.\n\nThiel Capital's press release said that the new office is located in Wynwood, a former warehouse district that has become a hub for startups, investors, and cultural institutions. The lease was signed in December, and the new office will \"complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles,\" the firm said.\n\nThe announcement comes as a proposal for a wealth tax was floated in California.\n\nMiami's startup and finance scene heated up during the pandemic and in the years that followed, with many big firms from California and New York relocating their headquarters and expanding their offices there.\n\nSan Francisco-based Founders Fund, the venture capital firm cofounded by Thiel, has had an office in Miami since 2021. In 2020, Thiel bought an $18 million house in Miami's Venetian Islands.\n\nCalifornia is debating a proposed wealth tax that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents with net worths exceeding $1 billion, to be paid over five years.\n\nThe wealth tax still needs 870,000 signatures to even make it to the ballot in November 2026, where it would then be approved or rejected by voters at the ballot box. However, billionaires have already been critical of the plan and warned of an exodus of the wealthy.\n\nIt was proposed by SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West and designed to offset anticipated cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance.\n\nIn comparison to an income tax, a wealth tax is a levy on all of an individual's net worth, because it is difficult to quantify the annual income of a person who doesn't earn normal paychecks but has other assets that gain value every year. The tax would apply to the roughly 200 billionaires residing in California, which has a total population of over 39 million people. The SEIU-UHW estimates that the one-time tax will bring in $100 billion over five years for the state.\n\nCelebrity attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of his clients, warning that his clients will \"permanently relocate\" if the California wealth tax passes.\n\nIzzy Gardon, a spokesperson for Newsom's office, told Business Insider that the governor has \"consistently opposed state-level wealth taxes\" and that a wealth tax, \"if implemented at a state-only level, they drive a race to the bottom.\"\n\nIf passed, the wealth tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Put your hands down, class, I know what your question is.\n\nHas a Louisville team ever before been whistled for 16 fouls in a half?\n\nWhich U of L was in the opening twenty at venerable Haas Pavilion.\n\nMy definitive answer after checking the media guide is a definitive probably not.\n\nOn December 10, 1953, the Cards were flagged for 43 total in a 71-78 L at Siena.\n\nOK, it is for sure. The laws of mathematics dictate they must have had more than that in one, probably both halves.\n\nThe Cards, despite being -12 at the line in the 1st, led by 14 at the break, 48-34.\n\nThanks to coming out scorching, draining their first five shots, three Sananda Fru deuces, and a pair of triples, one by Ryan Conwell, the other by Isaac McKneely.\n\nCal never pulled closer than 7, and the Cardinals never led by less than double digits after the 12:10 mark of the opening stanza.\n\nOK, here’s my question: WTF was Vangelis Zougris doing in the game just past midway through the 2d?\n\nDuring his three minute stint, the Golden Bears went on a 9-0 thrust.\n\nVZ was technically only -9 (the only negative +/- for a Cardinal). But technically he was really -14. But Pat Kelsey wisely benched him after he committed one of the stupidest deadball Ts I’ve ever witnessed. Which resulted in five more California tallies, two FTs and a trey.\n\nThe bracing 14 point run cut the margin to 73-62 with 6:27 left.\n\nThen  U of L’s maturity reigned.\n\nAdrian Wooley scored a second chance deuce, then followed it with a triple.\n\nThe seven point skein steadied the situation.\n\nU of L — playing shorthanded without Mikel Brown or Kasean Pryor — kept Cal’s measure the rest of the way.\n\nIt was simply one of the oddest twenty point victories I can recall.\n\nMidway through the 2d, the Cardinals led 68-43 and were teetering. Ryan Conwell had just been called for his fourth foul. Woeful marksmanship after intermission to that point. 7/19. 2/10. But the Bears, perhaps the most mediocre 12-1 squad in memory, were more inept. 5/19. 1/9. For the half, U of L was actually +4 at the line at that moment.\n\nSoon thereafter came the Zougrisian Abominata.\n\nSteadiness and that much appreciated level headedness prevailed.\n\nLouisville only committed 9 infractions in the 2d, one less than the home team.\n\nFor the tilt, the Cards were +19 off the glass, +20 in the paint.\n\nThough Conwell led Louisville in scoring with 26, for my money, it was the Hadley glue and the Wooley bully — couldn’t help myself — that were most key.\n\nJH had 11 with 9 boards and 3 assists. AW had 21, many were important answers and thrust stoppers.\n\nSanny Fru was also boffo. He fashioned his first double double with 13 and 14.\n\nKobe Rodgers was a steady, calming presence. As usual. Khani Rooths was strong in his 18 minutes. And McKneely remains way more an all around positive than most expected.\n\nOvercoming a cross country trip, significant foul trouble, the absence of two key ballers, in your conference opener on the road for a 20 point W is not to be sneezed at.\n\nNext: a trip down to Silicon Valley for a date with Stanford Friday night in Palo Alto.",

    "description": "Bill Ackman, Palmer Luckey, Garry Tan, and more are sharing their opinions on a California billionaire tax proposal.",
    "fullText": "Some of the biggest names in business are speaking up about California's billionaire tax proposal.\n\nThe measure proposed a one-time 5% tax for California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion. If the proposal receives enough signatures, it would appear on the state ballot in November.\n\nIf the proposal passes, the tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nProposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union, the bill attempts to fill a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nCalifornia is home to some of the biggest companies — in both value and prestige — in the US. The state boasts Hollywood and Silicon Valley, although some of the industries' key players have relocated.\n\nIn a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom obtained by Business Insider, attorney Alex Spiro wrote that his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the tax becomes law. Spiro has previously represented billionaires and celebrities.\n\nHere's how several business leaders and politicians have reacted to the tax proposal:\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Holdings wrote Monday on X that he was \"opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property,\" which can have \"unintended and negative consequences.\"\n\nHowever, he said he's in favor of a \"fairer tax system.\"\n\nFor example, Ackman wrote that an individual who had amassed a billion dollars or \n\n\"One shouldn't be able to live and spend like a billionaire and pay no tax,\" Ackman wrote.\n\nAs for California's \"budget problems,\" Ackman wrote that the issue wasn't a lack of tax revenue — it was about \"how the money is being spent.\"\n\nThe White House AI and crypto czar took aim at California's government in an X post on Sunday.\n\nRed states like Texas and Florida don't employ state income taxes, let alone wealth taxes, Sacks wrote. \"Democrats steal everything, then blame job creators for their 'greed,'\" he wrote.\n\nSacks said in an October episode of the \"All-In\" podcast, which he cohosts, that a wealth tax \"always backfires,\" because tax benefits are outweighed by wealthy residents leaving.\n\nSacks threatened to leave the state, analogizing steady tax increases to boiling a frog on the podcast.\n\n\"I'm going to have to jump out of the pot with this,\" he said.\n\nThe Congressman for California's 17th district, which covers much of Silicon Valley, said that the proposal was \"good for American innovation.\"\n\nAfter receiving thousands of comments on a Friday post bidding a sarcastic goodbye to those threatening to leave the state, Khanna explained his support in a seven-paragraph X post on Saturday.\n\nHe wrote that Nvidia would be built all over again, even with the wealth tax.\n\n\"Jensen [Huang] wasn't thinking I won't start this company because I may have to one day pay a 1% tax on my billions,\" Khanna wrote. \"He built here because the talent is here.\"\n\nKhanna argued that innovation would be further stifled by the \"political dysfunction and social unrest\" that comes with wide wealth gaps.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, wrote that the representative has \"always supported a modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have healthcare.\"\n\n\"He has advocated for common sense workarounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock,\" Drory wrote.\n\nThe Oculus founder and Anduril cofounder wrote in a Sunday X post that the tax would force founders to \"sell huge chunks of our companies.\"\n\nLuckey wrote that he made money from Oculus — which he sold to Facebook in 2014 — and paid millions in taxes on it. Then he used the \"remainder\" to start Anduril, he wrote.\n\n\"Now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash,\" Luckey wrote.\n\nLuckey also wrote that the policy made no provision for companies that funnel revenue back to research and development, rather than paying cash incomes sizable enough to cover the tax.\n\n\"You are effectively forcing companies to immediately pivot into profit obsession over mission or long-term sustainability,\" he wrote.\n\nThe CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator wrote in a Saturday X post that the tax would \"kill little tech in California.\"\n\nUnicorn startup founders become a \"paper billionaire\" — as in, having cash on hand — around the $5 billion valuation point, Tan wrote.\n\nThe proposed tax is on unrealized gains, meaning founders would be put on the line even before their wealth is liquid, Tan wrote.\n\nIf the tax passed, Tan wrote that Y Combinator would consider opening Austin or Cambridge programs.\n\nThe Vermont senator has long been a proponent of taxes on the wealthy, introducing a bill in 2019 that aimed to halve the wealth of billionaires over a 15-year period.\n\nWhile Sanders didn't explicitly comment on the California proposal, he posted Monday on X broadly supporting wealth taxes.\n\n\"We can respect innovation & entrepreneurship, but we cannot respect the extraordinary greed that now exists,\" Sanders wrote. \"We need a wealth tax.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO reposted another user's X post that commented on the tax, saying that his stocks weren't wealth.\n\nMusk wrote in his Tuesday post that his \"wealth\" was mostly tied up in Tesla and SpaceX shares.\n\n\"This means my 'wealth' can only increase due to producing more products and services for the public,\" he wrote.\n\nWhile not directly commenting on the California tax, Musk wrote that he was a \"maker,\" unlike \"taker\" politicians like Sanders.\n\nMusk said in 2020 that he had moved from California to Texas.\n\nThe governor of California has spoken against the wealth tax. At The New York Times' Dealbook conference in December, Newsom said that California had to stay competitive with other states.\n\n\"People of that status, they already have two or three homes outside the state,\" he said. \"You've got to be pragmatic about it.\"\n\nIf the tax passes as a ballot measure, Newsom would not have the ability to veto it.",

But I can’t speak exactly to what the motive would be.”\n\nOwen Roth, one of Michael Abatti’s attorneys, said his client surrendered to law enforcement, agreed to be extradited to Arizona and remains innocent under the law. “Our client is in his mid-60s and has significant health issues, and we continue to worry about his well-being,” Roth said. “We ask the public to respect his privacy and constitutional rights and reiterate that this case will be decided based on the evidence by a jury.” An autopsy report released Monday said Kerri Abatti’s cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nThe report said she was found unconscious on the floor near her kitchen by her nephew, who told investigators he heard a loud sound before finding her. When investigators searched the home they found a “circular defect” on a window and determined “a gunshot likely originated from the yard outside the home,” the autopsy report said.\n\nThe Associated Press left a message for the Navajo County Sheriff’s Office for further explanation. The medical examiner’s office in Coconino County, which conducted the autopsy, directed questions about the report to a Navajo County official, and the AP also left a message for the official. A descendant of early Latter-day Saints settlers who helped found Pinetop in the 1880s, Kerri had filed for divorce, with proceedings pending in California at the time of her death.\n\nAuthorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife’s death.\n\nMichael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops. His grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region’s early settlers and his father helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association.\n\nMichael Abatti served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.\n\nThe Abattis, who married in 1992 and had three children, were sparring over finances. Kerri told the court the couple had lived an affluent lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned property in three states, vacationed internationally and sent their children to private school.\n\nKerri initially received $5,000 monthly temporary spousal support. She later sought an increase, citing struggles to maintain her standard of living as well as keep up the Arizona property. She also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney’s fees, court filings showed.\n\nMichael Abatti eventually agreed to raise support to $6,400 monthly, despite having countered in a court filing that poor farming years had reduced his income. He blamed market shifts favoring Ukrainian crops, rising shipping costs and harsh weather.",

    "fullText": "More than 60 million people across the U.S. are under winter weather alerts as a powerful storm system targets the Northeast after Christmas, while a separate atmospheric river continues to batter California with flooding rain, high winds and dangerous conditions.\n\nForecasters warn the systems could disrupt flights and road travel as millions of Americans head home after the holidays.\n\nThe severe weather is expected to unfold over several days, with impacts stretching from the West Coast to the Northeast. Forecasters say conditions on the ground could change quickly, affecting everything from short drives to long-distance travel. Here’s what to know about the most affected regions.\n\nThe tristate area is expected to bear the brunt of a major winter storm on Friday, with snow, sleet and freezing rain forecast to create hazardous travel conditions. Accumulating snow is forecast to hit New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — where a state of emergency has been declared — beginning Friday through early Saturday. Some forecast models suggest that parts of New York and New Jersey will see up to 9 inches of snow, depending on the storm’s track.\n\nThe storm is already disrupting air travel in the region. As of Friday morning, at least 1,300 flights across the U.S. had been canceled, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware, with delays expected to grow as the storm intensifies.\n\nSnowfall totals of roughly 1 to 6 inches are expected across northeastern Pennsylvania, much of New Jersey, large portions of New York state and parts of southern and central New England, with higher amounts possible in elevated areas north and west of New York City.\n\nThe system is also expected to bring sleet and freezing rain to parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and northern Virginia. A wintry mix is likely in cities including Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.\n\nOn the West Coast, California is facing dangerous conditions from a powerful atmospheric river system bringing flooding rain, high winds and heavy mountain snow to the state.\n\nWith atmospheric rivers, intense rainfall, and strong winds ahead, I’m declaring a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties to activate emergency authorities and preposition resources to keep our communities safe. pic.twitter.com/C3eLImPkwx\n\n— Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) December 24, 2025\n\nThe storm has already turned deadly, with at least three deaths reported in Southern California.\n\nParts of Southern California saw record-breaking rainfall earlier this week, with some locations seeing their wettest Christmas Eve or Christmas-week totals in decades.\n\nThe prolonged rainfall has increased the threat of mudslides, particularly in areas recently burned by wildfires. Officials have urged residents to avoid flooded roadways and to be prepared to evacuate if conditions worsen.\n\nAt higher elevations, the same storm system has delivered dangerous winter weather to the Sierra Nevada, making mountain travel hazardous across parts of California and western Nevada.\n\nAvalanche warnings were issued for parts of the Sierra as heavy snow and strong winds created unstable conditions in the mountains. Forecasters say 5 to 10 feet of snow could pile up in some high-elevation areas, significantly increasing avalanche risk and making travel especially dangerous through the weekend.\n\nThe Sierra Avalanche Center has issued a Backcountry Avalanche Watch for the backcountry areas around the Greater Lake Tahoe region as high avalanche danger is expected Thursday.

The American Automobile Association estimates that more than 122 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles during the end-of-year holiday period, increasing the potential for widespread delays as severe weather moves across the country.",

    "fullText": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — California this week dropped a lawsuit officials filed against the Trump administration over the federal government's withdrawing of $4 billion for the state's long-delayed high-speed rail project.\n\nThe U.S. Transportation Department slashed funds for the bullet train aimed at connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles in July. The Trump administration has said the California High-Speed Rail Authority had “ no viable plan ” to complete a large segment of the project in the farm-rich Central Valley.\n\nThe authority quickly filed a lawsuit, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom calling the federal government's decision “a political stunt to punish California.”\n\nThe authority said this week that it would focus on other funding sources to complete the project, which is estimated to cost more than $100 billion.\n\n“This action reflects the State’s assessment that the federal government is not a reliable, constructive, or trustworthy partner in advancing high-speed rail in California,” an authority spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe Transportation Department did not respond to a request for comment. President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have both previously criticized the project as a “train to nowhere.”\n\n“The Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social in July. “This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.”\n\nThe authority's decision to drop the lawsuit comes as the group seeks private investors to support the bullet train. The project recently secured $1 billion in annual funding from the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045.\n\nThe program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.\n\nThe rail authority said its shift in focus away from federal funding offers “a new opportunity.”\n\n“Moving forward without the Trump administration’s involvement allows the Authority to pursue proven global best practices used successfully by modern high-speed rail systems around the world,” a spokesperson said in a statement.",

    "fullText": "WRIGHTWOOD, Calif. (AP) — A strong storm system that brought relentless winds, rain and snowfall to California this week was expected to ease Friday, but there was still a risk of high surf along the coast, flash flooding near Los Angeles and avalanches in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nWaves near the San Francisco Bay Area could reach up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) Friday, parts of Southern California were at risk of flooding, and avalanches could hit the Lake Tahoe area, officials warned. Residents were told to be ready to evacuate the mountain town of Wrightwood about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles because of mudslides.\n\nAtmospheric rivers carried massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The storms were blamed for at least two deaths earlier in the week.\n\nThe system brought the wettest Christmas season to downtown Los Angeles in 54 years, the National Weather Service said.\n\nRoads in the 5,000-resident town of Wrightwood were covered in rocks, debris and thick mud on Thursday. With power out, a gas station and coffee shop running on generators were serving as hubs for residents and visitors.\n\n“It’s really a crazy Christmas,” said Jill Jenkins, who was spending the holiday with her 13-year-old grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo.\n\nLopiccolo said the family almost evacuated the previous day, when water washed away a chunk of their backyard. But they decided to stay and still celebrated the holiday. Lopiccolo got a new snowboard and e-bike.\n\n“We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights,” he said.\n\nDavey Schneider hiked a mile and a half (1.6 kilometers) through rain and floodwater up to his shins from his Wrightwood residence Wednesday to rescue cats from his grandfather’s house.\n\n“I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” Schneider said Thursday. “Fortunately, they all lived. They’re all okay — just a little bit scared.”\n\nArlene Corte said roads in town turned into rivers, but her house was not damaged.\n\n“It could be a whole lot worse,” she said. “We’re here talking.”\n\nWith more rain on the way, more than 150 firefighters were stationed in the area, said San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Shawn Millerick.\n\n“We’re ready,” he said. “It’s all hands on deck at this point.”\n\nA falling tree killed a San Diego man Wednesday, news outlets reported. Farther north, a Sacramento sheriff’s deputy died in what appeared to be a weather-related crash.\n\nAreas along the coast, including Malibu, were under a flood watch until Friday afternoon, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSouthern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters), with even \n\nMore wind and heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, where gusts created “near white-out conditions” and made mountain pass travel treacherous.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared emergencies in six counties to allow state assistance.\n\nThe state deployed resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.",

    "fullText": "Heavy rain and fierce winds from an atmospheric storm slammed Southern California on Wednesday, flooding roads and triggering mudslides as authorities urged parts of the region to evacuate.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties on Wednesday. Some areas had already received 4 to 8 inches of rain by Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAnother wave of the storm was expected to hit on Christmas Day, with flood and wind advisories for \"life-threatening\" storm conditions from the National Weather Service remaining in effect until Thursday afternoon.\n\nOver 163,000 homes and businesses across California were still without power on Christmas morning, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Redding Police Department reported one storm-related fatality in Northern California. Two more deaths occurred in South Sacramento and San Diego, CNN reported.\n\nThe storms are affecting the entire state, from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\n\nThe storms began on Christmas Eve, with the Weather Prediction Center warning that a \"dangerous scenario\" was on the way.\n\nPer CNN, 15 million people were still in the moderate-risk zone for flooding on Christmas Day.\n\nThe airport saw 3 inches of rainfall on the 24th.\n\nAccording to CNN, emergency crews were pulling people from flooded cars and homes, and some people even had to be rescued from their roofs via helicopter.\n\nSarah Bailey, a resident of the Wrightwood area for two decades, told the Times this was the worst flooding she'd seen.\n\nChristopher Prater, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department, told the outlet they'd received \"dozens\" of rescue calls on Wednesday night.\n\nA Pineapple Express is an atmospheric river, a band of concentrated water vapor. These \"rivers\" are responsible for 30 to 50% of California's rainfall.\n\nThe power outages are focused in Northern California, according to The New York Times.\n\nAny additional rainfall that comes on the 25th and 26th, even if it's less intense, could cause more flooding and debris to wash away, especially in areas that were devastated by the LA wildfires earlier this year.\n\n\"I am urging all Angelenos to stay safe and be extremely careful on the roads if you absolutely must travel,\" Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles said in a statement. \"Please do not take this storm lightly.\"",

    "fullText": "HONOLULU (AP) — Backup quarterback Drew Weaver threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Nick Cenacle with 10 seconds left, and Hawaii rallied for a 35-31 victory over California in a thrilling Hawaii Bowl on Wednesday night.\n\nWeaver entered the game after Micah Alejado took a hard hit on the previous play. With the Rainbow Warriors (9-4) in range for a tying field goal, coach Timmy Chang took a shot at the end zone, and Cenacle got between two defensive backs and made the contested catch.\n\nChang, Hawaii’s fourth-year coach who had a record-setting career as the Rainbow Warriors’ quarterback from 2000-04, led his program to its first nine-win season since 2019 — when Nick Rolovich, currently Cal’s interim coach, guided Hawaii to a 10-5 record.\n\nAlejado finished 32 of 46 for 274 yards and three touchdowns, helping Hawaii rally from an early 21-0 deficit. Pofele Ashlock had 14 catches for 123 yards and two TDs for the Rainbow Warriors, who scored 22 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nCal (7-6) pulled ahead 31-28 with 1:57 left on a 1-yard touchdown run by Hawaii-born freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele, who finished with 343 yards passing and a touchdown.\n\nAlejado’s 17-yard touchdown pass to Brandon White with 7:19 left gave Hawaii a 28-24 lead. The Rainbow Warriors tied it early in the fourth quarter when Alejado connected with Ashlock for their second TD and then completed a 2-point conversion pass to Cam Barfield.\n\nCal took a 21-0 lead early in the second quarter on Anthony League’s 8-yard TD run.\n\nCal was picked to finish third-to-last in the Atlantic Coast Conference preseason media poll, but finished the season tied for seventh in the ACC. Coach Justin Wilcox was fired last month and will be replaced next season by Oregon defensive coordinator Tosh Lupoi. Sagapolutele has committed to staying with the program in 2026.\n\nHawaii has plenty to build on as it enters Chang’s fifth season. Although leading receiver Jackson Harris announced his intention to transfer and did not play Wednesday, Alejado and Ashlock have said they plan to return.\n\nCal will host UCLA on Sept. 5, 2026.\n\nHawaii will also begin next season in the Bay Area when it visits Stanford on Aug. 29.",

    "fullText": "A California woman has been charged with murder after the remains of her missing 9-year-old daughter were found in Utah, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nAshlee Buzzard, 40, was arrested Tuesday after bullet cartridges found near her daughter's body were linked to a used cartridge case found in her home, said Santa Barbara County’s Sheriff-Coroner Bill Brown. Authorities found 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard’s body Dec. 6 in a rural area of Utah after a man and woman taking photos off of State Route 24 reported they had discovered remains.\n\nOfficers could not immediately identify her but concluded she died from gunshot wounds to the head, Brown said. The FBI's DNA analysis of the body found a familial DNA match to Buzzard.\n\nDetectives also found similar ammunition in a car Buzzard had rented, authorities said.\n\nBuzzard is being held without bail at the Northern Branch Jail in Santa Barbara, Brown said.\n\nOnline jail records did not list a court date or attorney who could speak on Buzzard’s behalf. The public defender’s office represented her in another case in November but did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA school administrator reported Melodee Buzzard's prolonged absence Oct. 14. Deputies went to the family's residence in Lompoc, but Buzzard would not say where her daughter was.\n\nBuzzard left California with her daughter on Oct. 7, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office. They traveled as far as Nebraska with stops in Nevada, Arizona and Utah, and a return route included Kansas. Melodee Buzzard was last seen Oct. 9 on video surveillance near the Colorado-Utah line.\n\nDetectives learned the mother and daughter changed their appearance during travel. Video from the rental car office in Lompoc shows the child wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a wig that was darker and straighter than her natural hair, police said. The video shows her mother wearing a long, curly haired wig.\n\nBuzzard swapped wigs throughout the trip and changed the license plate of the rental car to avoid detection, police said. Buzzard returned home on Oct. 10 but her daughter was not with her, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nBrown said the crime was “calculated, cold-blooded” and premeditated, though a motive has not been determined.\n\n“Today, we stand together in grief, but also with resolve,” Brown said. “Melodee deserved a far better life than she had.”\n\nOfficials said the weapon has not been found, and the case remains under investigation.\n\nLilly Denes told the Los Angeles Times that her granddaughter was loveable, always smiling and well-behaved. Denes' son, the child's father, died when she was 6 months old. A detective told Denes on the phone Tuesday that authorities had “found the baby and the baby is with her dad,\" Denes said.\n\n“I knew he was telling me that the baby is dead,\" Denes said.",

    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance posted glossy photos of his personal training session with Navy SEALs—but the beachside stunt immediately drew mockery and accusations of political tone-deafness.\n\nThe 41-year-old former Marine, who served in Iraq before entering politics, had joined the Navy’s special-operations community for an early-morning workout at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California, a longtime hub for SEAL selection and training.\n\nFrom the official @VP account, Vance shared images on Monday of himself sprinting along the surf, hauling a log with helmeted operators whose faces were blurred, scrambling up a cargo net, and riding in a small boat punching through the waves.\n\n“Vice President Vance trains with @USNavy Seals at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado,” the caption read. On his personal account, Vance gushed that he had “just finished PT with the Navy SEALs for 90 minutes.”\n\nHe added, “They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train. So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world!”\n\nCritics were unimpressed. “Nice cosplay as a Navy SEAL,” one user wrote, adding: “Leadership isn’t about photo ops, it’s about fixing the mess at home.”\n\nOther critics photoshopped the infamous meme of Vance with a cartoonishly puffy face onto the soldiers he was working out with, using “GI Jello” as a punchline.\n\nAnother commenter sneered that it was a “desperate photo op for a Vice President who cares more about his military ‘aesthetic’ than actually governing.”\n\nDigital strategist Mike Nellis jabbed: “Cool, man—but when you’re done cosplaying, can you and your boss do something about housing and grocery prices? Thanks.”\n\nAnd Democratic strategist Christopher Hale wrote on X, “It’s the middle of the workday. While Americans are grinding to make Christmas work, the vice president is burning taxpayer dollars pretending to be a Navy SEAL.”\n\nVance’s made-for-camera workout follows a Trumpian trend of the president’s inner circle engaging in theatrics. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, 45, marked the D-Day anniversary and his birthday in June by leading a filmed PT session with troops on Omaha Beach before delivering a speech at the Normandy American Cemetery, a spectacle that also drew scrutiny as self-promotion.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has repeatedly been mocked as “ICE Barbie” for using federal law enforcement as props in a string of stylized photo ops, from tactical-gear raids to glossy fitness clips.\n\nThis is also not the first time Vance has tried to curry favor with the military. Ahead of Thanksgiving, he delivered a comedy skit to troops at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the vice president’s office for comment.",

    "fullText": "The future of high school football is here, and it’s burning bright. From California to Florida, Texas to Pennsylvania, gridiron stars have performed all across the country the past few months to electrify on Friday nights. We’re unveiling our Sophomore All-American list – the names you need to know now, because you’ll be hearing about them all throughout the off-season and into 2026. These athletes aren’t just talented; they’re the game-changers from this past 2025 high school football campaign.\n\nQB: Lukas Prock, Hun School\nWe’d be hard pressed to not have Prock heading up this list as the country’s top quarterback when you look at production, talent and competition he faced in 2025. The 6-foot-2, 180-pound quarterback went up against the likes of teams in Archbishop Spalding (Md.), The St. James Academy (Md.), St. Frances Academy (Md.), The First Academy and IMG Academy. The signal caller finished the season completing 226 of 309 passes for 4,330 yards and 41 touchdowns.\n\nRB: Xander Edwards, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nEdwards had himself a breakout season playing for the FHSAA Class 2A state semifinalist Bolles bulldogs. The sophomore running back averaged a ridiculous 9.9 yards per carry and rushed for 2,629 and scored 44 times on the ground. Add in his 17 catches for 211 yards and Edwards finishes just shy of 3,000 all-purpose yards for the 2025 season.\n\nRB: Zaiden Jernigan, Louisville (MS)\nJernigan made his name well known throughout the Magnolia State this past 2025 season as the running back put up some of the top numbers of any back in the country when it came to sophomores. The running back rushed for 1,563 yards on 238 carries and scored 20 touchdowns. The sophomore also added 205 yards and four touchdowns out of the backfield.\n\nWR: Roye Oliver, Hamilton (Ariz.)\nOliver was as good as advertised anytime he took the field for Hamilton, finishing the season catching 92 passes for 1,839 yards and scoring 29 touchdowns. There’s little doubt that Oliver is one of the country’s best wide receivers, regardless of class as he proved himself this 2025 campaign.\n\nWR: Brysen Wright, Mandarin (Fla.)\nThe four-star do-everything has done it all just about for Mandarin this past season, with Wright catching 46 passes for 983 yards and 10 touchdowns. Wright has also seen plenty of time on the defensive side of the ball as well, notching 63 tackles and intercepting five passes. The sophomore also contributed in the punt return game, totaling 254 yards on six returns.\n\nWR: Eric McFarland, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nThough McFarland reclassified to the Class of 2027, he was considered a sophomore throughout the entire 2025 high school football season. McFarland has shown his versatility not only going downfield, but also on jet sweeps, pop passes and even just taking hand-offs. Through nine games, McFarland caught 29 passes for 595 yards and scored 11 touchdowns.\n\nOT: R’Monie Edwards, Cypress Ranch (TX)\nAt 6-foot-5, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle was near impossible to get by for opposing defensive ends down in the Lone Star State. Rated a four-star by the Rivals Industry Rankings, Edwards led the way up front for over 4,500 all-purpose yards, 58 touchdowns and 463 points scored in 2025.\n\nOL: Elisha Mueller, Servite (Calif.)\nPlaying up against some of the top high school football programs in the land, Mueller held his own and then some for the Friars. Mueller is interchangeable at either guard position and led the way for Servite’s offense that totaled over 3,500 all-purpose yards and 39 touchdowns.\n\nC: Hunter Hill, Peach County (Ga.)\nHill can play center or at either guard position as he did during the 2025 season for the 10-2 Peach County Trojans. The 6-foot-3, 305-pound interior offensive lineman was superb in Year 2 and helped the Trojans amass 4,500-plus yards of offense and scoring 58 total touchdowns.\n\nOL: George Selvie III, Sumner (Fla.)\nFamiliar with the name? That’s because his father, George Selvie, starred at USF and eventually in the NFL. Now the younger Selvie plays for his father at Sumner and has blossomed into one of the top offensive linemen in the country when it comes to sophomores. Selvie III paved the way for over 3,800 yards and 45 touchdowns for the Class 7A region finalist Stingrays.\n\nOT: Jamarios Canton, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nProtecting the right side of Jayden Wade on Friday nights, Canton proved anytime out on the field that he was the top offensive tackle of the 2028 class. At 6-foot-4, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle took on all comers and right out of the gates against Hoover (Ala.) was pancaking opposing defensive linemen.\n\nAll-Purpose: Gaige Weddle, Rancho Bernardo (Calif.)\nI mean, what didn’t Weddle do for Rancho Bernardo in 2025? The dual-threat quarterback threw for 2,224 yards and 19 touchdowns through the air. Weddle led the team in rushing with 679 yards on just 98 attempts and 10 scores. Oh and Weddle also led the team on defense with 101 tackles, two sacks and two interceptions. Like we said, what didn’t Weddle do? He was what you want in a all-purpose athlete.\n\nEdge: Asher Ghioto, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nNo matter where Ghioto lined up on the defensive line, the 6-foot-5, 240-pound EDGE rusher was causing havoc for opposing offensive linemen. Ghioto finished the season totaling 84 tackles, 35 for a loss and 23 sacks.\n\nDT: Kellan Hall, Christian Academy of Louisville (KY)\nAnchoring the Centurions’ defensive line all throughout their undefeated 15-0 run to the KHSAA Class 3A state championship. Hall recently received defensive first-team all-state honors playing on the defensive line. When it comes to interior defensive linemen, there’s very few as agile and quick like the 6-foot-4, 255-pound stalwart.\n\nDT: Cory Cunningham, Providence (N.C.)\nThe four-star 6-foot-4, 265-pound defensive tackle was a force in North Carolina’s Class 8A throughout the season. Cunningham was unblockable for many opposing offensive linemen as the defensive tackle racked up 60 tackles, 28 going for a loss and 15 quarterback takedowns.\n\nEdge: Jackson Vaughn, Bergen Catholic (N.J.)\nJust because the numbers might’ve went down a little from his freshman campaign doesn’t mean that Vaughn didn’t remain a factor when it came to EDGE rushers. Teams took notice and Vaughn faced plenty of double and even triple teams. The edge rusher compiled 40 tackles, 12 for a loss and eight sacks.\n\nOLB: Judah Blair, Lakota West (OH)\nBlair at 6-foot-1, 200 pounds moves like a safety, but can hit you like a ton of bricks like a linebacker. The sophomore backer had a strong year in the linebacking corps for Lakota West, tallying 57 tackles, 15.5 going for a loss, three sacks and an interception.\n\nLB: Tahj Gray, St. Joseph Regional (N.J.)\nThe sophomore linebacker proved himself on the highest level of of New Jersey high school football, helping the St. Joseph Regional Green Knights win the NJSIAA Non-Public A state championship. Gray last season ended with 102 total tackles, 10.5 for a loss, four sacks and four passes broken up.\n\nLB: Nehemiah McCary, Maplesville (Ala.)\nMcCrary was a two-way force for Maplesville this past season as the Red Devils went on to win Alabama’s Class 1A state championship. The 6-foot-2, 225-pound linebacker’s performance in the state title game came on the offensive end of the ball where McCrary rushed for 182 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nCB: A’mir Sears, West Broward (Fla.)\nOne of the biggest reasons why West Broward made it all the way to Florida’s Class 6A state championship game was the play of the four-star athlete. Sears was dynamic on both sides of the ball, with the sophomore making 61 tackles, breaking up 11 passes and intercepting three others. On offense, Sears led the Bobcats with 942 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nCB: Langston Pridgeon, Stone Bridge (Va.)\nMany opposing quarterbacks thought twice before throwing to Pridgeon’s side of the field in 2025. Ranked as one of the top cornerbacks in the country, Pridgeon proved himself to being one of Virginia’s best players in the Bulldogs’ defensive secondary. Whether its playing in man or zone coverages, the sophomore excelled in his sophomore campaign.\n\nS: Casey Barner, McEachern (Ga.)\nHonestly, Barner could’ve been put at a multitude of spots on this list but his natural position is at safety and there was little doubt of his talents from the moment he stepped onto the field this season. In McEachern’s season-opening win 50-17 win over Walton, Barner compiled 341 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns.\n\nS: Giovanni Tuggle, Winder-Barrow (Ga.)\nIt’s an all-Georgia safety duo with Tuggle paired with Barner in the first team defensive backfield. Tuggle saw extensive playing time for the Bulldogs this past 2025 season as the four-star safety totaled 74 tackles, five pass breakups and also intercepted four others.\n\nPK: Jack Ciancio, Phenix City Central (Ala.)\nThe sophomore kicker was automatic when it came to extra points for the Phenix City Red Devils this past season, knocking down all 75 of his attempts. Ciancio connected on 11 field goals, with a long of 38 yards.\n\nP: Israel Carmona, Queen Creek (Ariz.)\nPlacing punts inside of an opponent’s 20-yard line was a specialty of Carmona’s this past season as the sophomore pinned teams deep into their own territory 17 times. On 39 punt attempts, Carmona averaged 40.6 yards with a long of 58 on the season.\n\nReturn Specialist: Tyree Mannings, Venice (Fla.)\nMannings was superb stepping into the No. 1 receiver role at Venice after Winston Watkins Jr. graduated and had built a strong connection with Howard quarterback commit Darryon Jones. The Indians’ top wide receiver hauled in 84 passes for 1,429 yards and 12 touchdowns. Mannings was deadly in the kick return game, compiling 335 return yards for the Indians.\n\nQB: Koa Malau’ulu, St. John Bosco (Calif.)\nRB: Taihj Moore, Deland (Fla.)\nRB: Kameron Battle, Carrollwood Day (Fla.)\nWR: Jaylen Addai, Shadow Creek (TX)\nWR: Jett Harrison, St. Joseph’s Prep (Pa.)\nWR: TJ Maddox, Winslow Township (N.J.)\nOT: Bryce Smalls, Archbishop Spalding (Md.)\nOL: Kris Scott, Taft (OH)\nC: Carl Noisette, Duluth (Ga.)\nOL: Maxx Jones, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nOT: Azhir Waddell, Dudley (N.C.)\nAll-Purpose: Deandre Bidden, Harper Woods (Mich.)\n\nEdge: Jalanie George, Desert Edge (Ariz.)\nDT: Kingston Brown, Carver (Ga.) \nDT: Jameer Whyce, Trotwood-Madison (OH)\nEdge: Darieon Prescott, Bolingbrook (IL)\nLB: Tysir Young, Middletown (DE)\nLB: Brayden Bonik, Ridge Point (TX)\nCB: Man Robinson, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nCB: Jermaine Cobbins, Springfield (Tenn.)\nS: Pole Moala, Leuzinger (Calif.)\nS: James Foster III, Lancaster (TX)\n\nPK: Luke Marchionni, Hamilton Southeastern (IN)\nP: Julian Trujillo, Eaglecrest (CO)\nReturn Specialist: Dillon Mitchell, C.E.

    "description": "For more than a month, the Bay Area has been subjected to a seemingly ceaseless stampede of earthquakes, rattling windows and raising fears across California.",
    "fullText": "For more than a month, the Bay Area has been subjected to a seemingly ceaseless stampede of earthquakes — the latest in a series of seismic swarms that have rattled windows and raised fears across California.\n\nThe latest swarm has been centered in the East Bay suburb of San Ramon, where a magnitude 4 earthquake struck Friday night — the largest since the cluster began — and a magnitude 3.9 on Saturday night. Since Nov. 9, there have been at least 80 earthquakes of magnitude 2 or greater in the area, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nWhile none of these quakes has been particularly potent — which was also the case in similar swarms recorded in Malibu, El Sereno and Ontario since 2024 — some fear the persistent seismic activity could foreshadow a back-of-mind concern for many Californians: the \"Big One.\"\n\nBut while experts acknowledge that some major earthquakes are preceded by more-modest temblors, they caution that the swarms by themselves probably don't offer a hint of when, or where, the next major quake will hit.\n\n\"There's gonna be a big earthquake in the Bay Area. We just can't say exactly when and where. So you should be prepared for that,\" said Annemarie Baltay, a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist.\n\nThe threat of a large earthquake always looms in California regardless of the appearance of small shakers. There is a 60% chance of an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater in the Los Angeles region by 2043, and a 72% chance of the same in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to 30-year estimates calculated by USGS in 2014.\n\nAcross California, there's also a 48% chance of a magnitude 7.5 quake or greater by 2043, and a 7% chance of a magnitude 8 or greater quake.\n\nIt is true that after every earthquake, there's a 1-in-20 chance it'll be followed by a larger magnitude temblor. But conventionally, only half of earthquakes have an easily detectable foreshock, while the other half do not.\n\nSouthern California has provided some recent examples of swarms that ultimately fizzled out. The Malibu area had a trio of scary earthquakes recently — a magnitude 4.6 earthquake on Feb. 9, 2024; a magnitude 4.7 on Sept. 12, 2024; and a magnitude 4.1 on March 9. But it has been quieter in the last six months.\n\nOntario endured a spate of shaking a little more than a year ago, topping out with a magnitude 4 quake on Oct. 6, 2024. But there have been fewer, much smaller quakes so far this year.\n\nAn earthquake swarm centered around El Sereno in Eastside Los Angeles also was detected last year, though that activity appears to have subsided following a magnitude 4.4 earthquake on Aug. 12, 2024.\n\nThe cluster of small San Ramon earthquakes in recent weeks is also not terribly unusual. The earthquakes are appearing on the northern end of the Calaveras fault as it runs into Mount Diablo.\n\nIncluding the current swarm and another last month, there have been nine earthquake swarms in the surrounding area since 1970. They have lasted anywhere from two to 42 days, with maximum magnitudes generally in the 3 to 4 range, according to Baltay.\n\n\"This is still really consistent with these kinds of swarms,\" Baltay said of the current activity.\n\nCertainly, for residents who feel the frequent small earthquakes, \"it's really unsettling ... you don't know when it's going to end,\" she said.\n\nNone of those earlier swarms resulted in a major quake on the northern section of the Calaveras fault, which hasn't ruptured catastrophically in modern history.\n\nStill, the Calaveras fault is one to watch for California. It's considered one of the most likely faults to rupture in a major quake for the Bay Area, and has the potential to trigger a magnitude 6.7 quake or greater. In 1984, a section of the Calaveras fault ruptured and caused the magnitude 6.2 Morgan Hill earthquake, which resulted in 21 minor injuries and $7.5 million in damage.\n\nAlso of concern are the Hayward fault and the notorious San Andreas fault, according to the USGS.\n\nThe smattering of small earthquakes in Southern California generated significant, not altogether unwarranted, attention last year.\n\nIn fact, 2024 ended up being a record of sorts for modest quakes in Southern California — there were 15 independent earthquake sequences that year with at least one magnitude 4 or higher earthquake, according to seismologist Lucy Jones. That was the highest total in 65 years, surpassing the 13 seen in 1988.\n\nBut last year's figure probably didn't mean much in the greater scheme of things. In 2025, there have been only five independent seismic sequences with at least one magnitude 4 or higher earthquake in Southern California.\n\nThat said, there have been situations when relatively modest quakes have preceded huge ones.\n\nIn 1857, a mammoth magnitude 7.8 earthquake ruptured along 225 miles of the San Andreas fault, stretching from Monterey County to Los Angeles County. That Big One hit at around 8:30 a.m. on Jan. 9, 1857, but it was preceded in Monterey County by a magnitude 5.6 earthquake an hour earlier, and a magnitude 6.1 earthquake an hour before that.\n\nAnd then there were the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes in the Mojave Desert. A magnitude 6.4 earthquake ruptured July 4 at 10:33 a.m., but that was followed by a much larger magnitude 7.1 earthquake at 8:19 p.m. the next day.\n\nThere were also a few harrowing months in 1992. A magnitude 6.1 Joshua Tree temblor on April 22 of that year made scientists nervous because its epicenter was only about 6 miles away from the San Andreas fault. After the Joshua Tree earthquake, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services issued an advisory for Southern California, warning people to be on alert for another, larger earthquake.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, \"nothing happened, but we kept on having all these aftershocks sitting there right near the San Andreas and making us uncomfortable and worrying about it,\" Jones said. The aftershocks eventually migrated north, away from the San Andreas.\n\nBut those aftershocks crept toward the eventual epicenter of a far more powerful earthquake in the Mojave Desert — the magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake of June 28, 1992. That quake resulted in aftershocks that also reactivated seismic activity around Joshua Tree.\n\n\"So we now had a continuous line of aftershocks coming all the way down to the San Andreas,\" Jones said.\n\nHours after the Landers earthquake, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck in Big Bear, \"which was on a different fault, but also the aftershocks to Big Bear extended down to the San Andreas in a different location,\" Jones said.\n\nThe result was so alarming to scientists and officials that the Governor's Office of Emergency Services issued what was then an unprecedented advisory urging people to stay off freeways, a call that came as freeway and bridge collapses from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake were still on the minds of many.\n\nNothing ended up happening on the San Andreas fault in 1992, however.\n\n\"It's probably the closest we've come to a prediction, ever,\" Jones said. \"We were really pretty nervous about it.\"\n\nHowever, there have been other major earthquakes with no easily noticeable foreshocks, Jones said. Those include some of the most destructive in recent memory, such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake and the 1971 Sylmar earthquake.\n\nA.

    "fullText": "Game developer, who was also involved in Medal of Honor and Titanfall, was killed in a car crash\n\nVince Zampella, the co-creator of the Call of Duty video game series, has died aged 55.\n\nThe head of the video game developer Respawn Entertainment and the co-founder of Infinity Ward was killed in a car crash in California, NBC Los Angeles reported.\n\nZampella led the creation of the bestselling video game series Call of Duty at Infinity Ward, and at his various studios he was involved in several highly successful game series from Medal of Honor to Titanfall.\n\nHe is reported to have died in a single-car accident on the Angeles Crest Highway, which was reported to the California highway patrol at 12.45pm on Sunday. The vehicle’s driver died at the scene, and a passenger died later in hospital.\n\nZampella began his career in video games in the mid-1990s. Most recently, he had been promoted to head of the Battlefield military shooter series of video games at EA Games – Battlefield 6 was released in October to critical acclaim.\n\nPreviously, in 2010, he founded Respawn Entertainment under EA, which created the Titanfall series of mech shooters and the popular multiplayer game Apex Legends.\n\nZampella is best known for his time in the 2000s at Infinity Ward, a studio he co-founded with Grant Collier and Jason West in 2002. There, he co-created the Call of Duty video game series and some of its most acclaimed entries, including Modern Warfare (2007) and Modern Warfare 2 (2009).\n\nThe Call of Duty games have gone on to sell more than 500m copies. In 2010, he was involved with other former Infinity Ward staff in a lawsuit against the series’ publisher, Activision, over unpaid royalties.\n\nIn a statement on Monday night, EA said: “This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work.\n\n“Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.”",

    "description": "Our Cal vs. Hawaii predictions back the Golden Bears to cover this short spread.",
    "fullText": "The Cal Golden Bears have already gotten a big win this bowl season, as star quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele has committed to the program for next season.\n\nNow, they’ll go for a second big win by winning an actual bowl game. Sagapolutele and the Golden Bears head out to the Pacific for the Hawaii Bowl to face off against the hometown Rainbow Warriors.\n\nThe Rainbow Warriors are slight home favorites, but my Cal vs. Hawaii predictions explain why JKS and the Golden Bears are a gift to add to college football picks in this Christmas Eve matchup.\n\nThis will be a close game, but Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele will be the best player on the field, and in the end, he'll be the difference in this game, leading Cal to a win in the Hawaii Bowl.\n\nIt was a season full of highs and lows for the Cal Golden Bears. Cal finished the season with seven wins, but it also had some bad losses that cost head coach Justin Wilcox his job.\n\nHowever, one thing is for certain. The Bears have something in Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele, and new HC Tosh Lupoi did enough to convince him to stay in Berkley. JKS can focus on his homecoming in the Hawaii Bowl.\n\nJKS, from Ewa Beach, Hawaii, finished the regular season throwing for 3,117 yards with 17 touchdowns to nine interceptions. He battled his consistency this season, but when he was on, he was really on.\n\nJust look at his regular-season finale against SMU. JKS torched the Mustangs for 330 yards with four touchdowns and no picks. In fact, he’s been on fire over the last three games, with 922 passing yards and no picks.\n\nMeanwhile, Hawaii enters this bowl with an 8-4 record, earning its first bowl berth under Timmy Chang.\n\nHawaii’s strength this season was its defense, and it has solid numbers against the pass. However, the Rainbow Warriors haven’t exactly faced too many good passing teams this season in the Mountain West. The one time they did, UNLV beat them 38-10.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, the Rainbow Warriors are always going to be a pass-first team, but that is the strength of his Cal defense, which ranks 43rd in success rate on dropbacks.\n\nIn front of family and friends, JKS starts the new era of Cal football off with a win in the Hawaii Bowl, covering the short spread in the process.\n\nI like the JKS and the Golden Bears to get off to a good start in the Hawaii Bowl. But this game could be a back-and-forth battle for 60 minutes. I already like JKS and Cal to put up some numbers in this one, but he won’t be the only one.\n\nHawaii QB Micah Alejado threw for 2,832 yards with 21 touchdowns compared to nine interceptions over his 10 games played this season, helping Hawaii put up 31 or more points in six of their last eight games.\n\nSpread: California -1.5 | Hawaii +1.5\n\nMoneyline: California -110 | Hawaii -110\n\nOver/Under: Over 52.5 | Under 52.5\n\nCal has hit the first-half moneyline in four of its last six games for +7.65 Units and a 91% ROI.

    "fullText": "Barcelona continued their scintillating La Liga form with a 2-0 victory over Villarreal in their final match of 2025. Goals from Raphinha and Lamine Yamal made it eight league wins in a row for the Catalans, who end the year with a four-point lead in the standings.\n\nThe match saw Frenkie de Jong make his return to the starting line-up after a number of weeks on the bench, and he was one of the standouts for Barcelona. As per Sport, he gave his reaction the victory in the mixed zone.\n\n“I’m very happy. We closed the year as leaders, which was the objective. Villarreal come out quickly on the counter and have dangerous players. I felt that we were superior. It was a well-deserved victory. We’re fine. Now is not the time for titles, but we are alive in everything.”\n\nJoan Garcia produced another impressive showing on his way to a clean sheet, and the Barcelona goalkeeper also spoke on the match to the club’s official media channels (via MD).\n\n“We knew it was very important to get the three points in the last game of the year. We have achieved it and we finished top in this first half of the season. There is still a long way to go but we had this objective and we have achieved it.\n\n“When a team is down one player, it always makes things easier for you. We would have liked to kill the game earlier and score the second before and then make a third, but they played very well and knew how to defend with ten men. The important thing is that we got the three points and kept a clean sheet.\n\n“I try to stop the ones that come to me. There are days when I can do it and others I can’t. Today, luckily, we got a clean sheet and I’m very happy.”\n\nGerard Martin also spoke to the media after the match at La Ceramica, and as per MD, he expressed pride over Barcelona’s growth in recent months.\n\n“We have grown a lot since the beginning of the season. We have improved in many things and it is showing in recent games. Villarreal are a difficult team and a difficult ground. We knew they hadn’t lost and it was important to win because we were at the top of the standings. It seems like an easy game, but it was complicated.”",

PB: 20.\n\nSad about not winning the billion-dollar Powerball jackpot? Don't throw away your tickets just yet.\n\nMore than 400 Powerball tickets worth more than $400 were sold across California over the weekend, with the highest \"consolation prize\" ticket going for more than $2.3 million.\n\nAccording to California Lottery's website on Saturday night, a ticket worth $2,323,527 was sold at Wright's Market on Ventura Boulevard in Oxnard.\n\nThis comes as a drawing was held for the then-jackpot of $1.5 billion. Below were the winning numbers for the Dec. 20 drawing – which apparently no one got all six numbers:\n\nThe drawing for the new jackpot of $1.6 billion will be held on Monday, December 22 at 8 p.m. PT.\n\nThere are 400 millions of reasons to dream, especially what you would do with the jackpot money. However, one thing all lottery winners have to take into account is the fact that their prizes will be taxed.\n\nSo how much do you really get after taxes?\n\nIt depends on a couple of factors: do you have to pay state taxes where you live? Will you take the lump sum payment or the annuity payout?\n\nAccording to Mega Millions' website, those electing to take the annuity option get one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments. Powerball follows an identical process for paying out its jackpot winners.\n\nThis story was reported from Los Angeles.\n\nThis report used information provided by the California Lottery website and mentioned previous FOX 11 reports.",

    "fullText": "400-Mile-Long Fog Blankets California For Weeks\n\nPretty much everyone feels like they see endless gray skies in winter, but California’s Central Valley is taking things a step further with three weeks of foggy conditions from a phenomenon called \"tule fog.\"\n\nSatellite imagery from NASA and CIRA has revealed how pervasive the fog has been for the region, with day-after-day and week-after-week fogginess never letting up.\n\nThe fog started to develop on Nov. 22 and was firmly in place by Nov. 24 — and it's pretty much been there ever since (though it has grown and shrunk a little on a day-to-day basis).\n\nSoil in the Central Valley has been nice and moist following a rainy autumn.\n\nIn fact, precipitation totals from September through November ranked among the top 10% wettest on record for most of central and southern California. Modesto and Hanford, California, each broke the record for the wettest meteorological fall since records began.\n\nSo we have moist air for the equation.\n\nIn late November, a stable high-pressure system developed over California, helping to trap all of that moisture.\n\nThe fog layer has kept things cool in the valley as the rest of the Southwest has been basking in above-average temperatures.\n\nNow we have our temperature inversion.\n\nIs the end coming soon? Until a storm comes in to clear out the moist air, there's no anticipated end to the foggy conditions. The National Weather Service in Hanford, California, is warning of fog at least through Friday of this week.\n\nSara Tonks is a content meteorologist with weather.com and has a bachelor’s and a master’s degree from Georgia Tech in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences along with a master’s degree from Unity Environmental University in Marine Science.",

    "description": "Posters that appeared at Tesla's California factories and a review of LinkedIn profiles show how the automaker is scaling its ride-hailing service.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on its \"Robotaxi\" service — and putting factory workers and sales staff in drivers' seats to make it happen.\n\nThe electric-car maker has started recruiting workers off factory lines to operate its ride-hailing fleet. Tesla is offering production associates and material handlers extra hours and pay to take on the role of AI operator, according to posters that appeared at its California factories earlier this month.\n\nThe AI operators sit in the driver's seat, actively monitoring the vehicle while Tesla's Full Self-Driving software is engaged, and taking over when needed. Tesla plans to eventually release the software as a fully autonomous service.\n\nThe extra sets of hands will help the company expand ride-hailing availability in the Bay Area, the posters said.\n\nThe posters, which also appeared in several engineering facilities, noted that staffers could earn $500 if they refer a friend for the AI operator role.\n\nSome sales staffers in Nevada and Arizona moved over to similar operator roles in Las Vegas and Phoenix last month, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles.\n\nAdding more operators could help Tesla speed up service. After Tesla rolled out its Robotaxi app to the public in September, wait times spiked, with some passengers reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes and a lack of available vehicles.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said he's recently seen wait times around 10 minutes in the Bay Area, and during peak commuting times, the app at times says it cannot provide a ride due to \"high service demand.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla completed the self-certification process for service in Nevada and Arizona last month. It has yet to apply for a license with the Nevada Transportation Authority to launch a commercial service, but it has a permit from the Arizona Department of Transportation that allows it to operate commercially in the state, spokespeople from the agencies told Business Insider.\n\nThe company has yet to begin offering paid rides in either state.\n\nMeanwhile, the company launched its Bay Area ride-hailing service in August. It's not registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California; it operates its service with a driver because the state has stricter regulations around autonomous vehicles than most other states, many of which operate around an honor system where the company self-certifies its vehicles.\n\nTesla has a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission that allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public as a regular car service with a driver. The agency has said Tesla is not authorized to transport members of the public in an autonomous vehicle.\n\nTesla currently has 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers registered for its ride-hailing service in California, according to a spokesperson for the CPUC. Tesla is required to update the agency incrementally as it adds new vehicles to the fleet, but not drivers, the spokesperson said. (The registration number reflects vehicles approved for use; it doesn't necessarily indicate how many are operating at any given time.)\n\nLast December, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles for a permit with the California Department of Motor Vehicles that would allow it to test its autonomous software with a test driver.\n\nA spokesperson for the DMV said Tesla has yet to apply for a driverless testing permit, which would be required before the company can offer AV rides to the public.\n\nThe company also operates a ride-hailing service in Austin, where it launched with a safety operator in the passenger seat.\n\nMusk said during an xAI event earlier this month that Tesla's Austin service will be driverless by the end of the year.\n\n\"I think it's pretty much a solved problem, we're going through validation right now,\" he said, according to a recording posted on social media.\n\nA spokesperson for the Austin Transportation Department told Business Insider that the company has yet to inform the city of the date it plans to roll out the driverless feature to its commercial service. Tesla is not legally required to inform the city, but it has typically alerted it to changes to its service, the spokesperson said.\n\nTesla is hiring for AI operators across the US, including in Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado, and Texas, according to its website. The role has around-the-clock shifts and requires workers to sit behind the wheel while FSD is engaged, interact with passengers, and collect detailed reports on vehicle performance. It can also involve testing in various cities across the country. The salary ranges from around $25 to $30 per hour.\n\nThe recruiting process involved an FSD test drive, a valid driver's license, and passing a drug test and background check, according to people who interviewed for the role.\n\nMusk said in October that the company plans to expand its service to eight to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. The company is testing its service in several cities across the country.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at gkay@businessinsider.com or Signal at 248-894-6012.

The company has registered 798 drivers, the spokesperson said.\n\nThat's up from 28 cars and 128 drivers in August, when the service launched, according to the CPUC.\n\nThe vehicle number reflects car that have been approved for use, not the actual operational fleet number. The spokesperson also said the carmaker isn't required to update the state as it adds new drivers, which means the current number could be higher.\n\nThe Alphabet-backed autonomous vehicle company began offering driverless rides for select members of the public in 2023.\n\nThe agency said Zoox has 229 registered vehicles. Zoox, which launched in San Francisco in November, told Business Insider that it has 50 vehicles active in its fleet between San Francisco and Las Vegas. Zoox and Waymo run fully autonomously.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast year, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles with the California Department of Motor Vehicles for a permit to test its self-driving software with a test driver.\n\nTesla's \"Robotaxi\" isn't registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California, which maintains some of the strictest AV regulations in the country. The company has not applied for a driverless testing permit, a DMV representative told Business Insider.\n\nThe company's permit from the CPUC allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public. A separate permit is required to transport passengers using an autonomous vehicle.\n\nSome users have complained on social media of long wait times since the company launched the Robotaxi app to the public in September. Tesla initially started operating the service with a small group of early access users; as access expanded, wait times have increased, with some users reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said that at times recently he's been unable to secure a ride due to a lack of inventory during peak commuting hours. On off hours, he's seen wait times around ten minutes, he said.\n\nTesla is ramping up driver staffing. The company has circulated flyers in its California factories offering hourly employees extra pay to help operate its network.\n\nIn Austin, where Elon Musk has said Tesla recently began testing its vehicles without drivers or safety operators, it's unclear how many cars the company has running in the service. Tesla is not required to submit these numbers to Austin, a spokesperson for the transportation department said.\n\nMusk said during an appearance in the \"All In\" podcast in October that Tesla planned to have around 500 vehicles running in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A Northern California man caught a plump canary rockfish he says weighed in at 10.25 pounds (4.65 kilograms), likely setting state and world records.\n\nMendocino County fisherman Brendan Walsh, 26, said he caught the fish Tuesday off the coast of Albion, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of San Francisco.\n\nWalsh was headed back with his father Will Walsh after catching a few yellowtail on a cold and rainy day when he decided to make one last stop at a deeper spot. That's where the younger Walsh landed the canary rockfish.\n\n“It was a fluke,” he said. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”\n\nCanary rockfish can grow up to 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) in length and weigh 10 lbs. (4.5 kilograms), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Walsh says the ones he usually catches are small and scrawny, clocking in around 3 lbs. (1.4 kilograms).\n\nWalsh said the fish he caught this week was 2.25 feet (0.68 meters) long.\n\nHe submitted the catch to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which tracks angling and diving records. The current state record-holding fish weighed in at 9 lbs. and was caught last November, also in Mendocino County.\n\nThe department has a form and instructions for submitting a possible record catch, including the names and phone numbers of witnesses. Applicants are asked to contact the department for the nearest environmental scientist who can identify the catch.\n\nWalsh said they weighed the fish at an authorized fish market nearby and a state fish and wildlife scientist who works in the area came over to sign off on the paperwork.\n\nWalsh has also submitted his catch to the International Game Fish Association in Florida, where the world record holding 10-pound canary rockfish was caught in 1986. He says larger fish may have been caught but never submitted for record consideration.\n\nThe game fish association did not respond Friday to a request for comment.\n\nAfter spending Tuesday making sure they had taken the right measurements to document the catch, Walsh's mother, Deirdre Lamb, fried the rockfish with garlic and butter to eat on Wednesday.\n\nThe rockfish was delicious, he said.",

    "fullText": "He told his physician he couldn’t stand or sit without “significant pain,” authorities say.\n\nHousehold chores were anything but routine.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Officer Jordan Roy Lester claimed a medical retirement was the only recourse because of a debilitating injury, according to authorities. Then the department’s internal affairs investigators observed Lester on property he'd newly purchased cutting down trees, stacking firewood and operating heavy machinery.\n\nFast-forward two years and the 17-year veteran pleaded guilty in Sacramento County court on Wednesday to felony insurance fraud and was sentenced to 270 days in a county jail.\n\nLester, 45, is also on two years' formal probation and has been ordered to pay $232,829 in restitution to the CHP and $127,791 to the state compensation insurance fund.\n\nHe’ll also lose his service and pension credit for the years in which fraud was committed.\n\n“We take workers’ compensation fraud very seriously as it has an immediate and lasting financial impact on employers and delays medical care and financial assistance to employees legitimately injured at work,” Sacramento County Dist. Atty. Thien Ho said in a statement.\n\nHo added: “To have a peace officer commit this fraud is not only a violation of their duty to serve and protect with integrity, but it is also a violation of public trust.”\n\nLester was arrested in Quincy, in the Plumas National Forest of Northern California, in August 2024 after a multiyear investigation by the CHP's Workers’ Compensation Fraud Investigation Unit. Lester filed a workers' compensation claim in July 2021, though his superiors said the injury was “not significant,” according to the Sacramento County District Attorney's office. He was not taken off duty.\n\nLester had been assigned to the CHP's Central Division but briefly was moved to Quincy, according to the CHP office there. The home he purchased was located in Quincy.\n\nOn his days off he worked the property, according to the D.A.’s office, and eventually reached out to a former officer about obtaining medical retirement, according to authorities.\n\nIf he'd succeeded in getting medical retirement, he would have received 85% of his salary for life, tax-free, the D.A.’s office said.\n\nAs a CHP officer, Lester earned more than $260,000 in pay and benefits in 2021, according to the public pay database Transparent California.\n\nIn January 2022, Lester visited a doctor to have his claim substantiated, authorities said. He immediately was taken off his normal shift. His fortunes unraveled not long after when investigators witnessed him on his property engaging in “heavy physical activity,” according to the D.A.’s office.\n\nAn independent medical examiner tested Lester in February 2024 and said that not only could Lester “perform all work duties,” but the CHP veteran also “exaggerated his complaints,” according to the D.A.’s office.\n\nHe was arrested six months later.\n\nA.

    "description": "Joe Tiller took his Boilermakers on a trip to Pasadena, California, several years before they eventually made the Rose Bowl. More on that foundational moment:",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: This story is the third in a series related to Purdue's 2000 football season.\n\nIt's Sept. 13, 2025, a date several members of Purdue football's 2000 Big Ten championship team had eagerly awaited for weeks.\n\nThe Boilermakers are hosting USC and, for a bunch of guys who last suited up for the Boilermakers more than two decades earlier, this is a full circle moment.\n\nThe two programs hadn't played since the 1998 season opener in Los Angeles.\n\nPurdue lost that game 27 years ago, but what many who were there remember is the day after. Coach Joe Tiller had a planned field trip the players weren't looped in about.\n\n\"This was way out of the norm for coach Tiller. He was football, strictly business,\" safety Ben Smith said. \"For him to, one, not make us fly back after the game and, two, take us to the Rose Bowl, we had no idea where we were going.\n\n\"We show up there and there’s the neon lights. He gave us the old coach fire up talk and said, 'Guys, I want you to go out there and feel the grass, look in the stands. I want you to go in the press box and walk around this place and envision before you’re done playing here, playing in the Rose Bowl.'\"\n\nTwo years later, Tiller's Boilermakers finished in a three-way tie for the Big Ten title and were the league's representative to play Washington in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1, 2001.\n\nSurvey Purdue's roster during that time period and you'll get various answers on the program-shifting moment that resulted in that Rose Bowl trip. For some, it's that game at USC. Others say Purdue's upset of No. 4 Kansas State in the 1998 Alamo Bowl.\n\nTiller's second game as Boilermaker coach on Sept. 13, 1997. The roster was a blend of Jim Colletto recruits, who'd been a part of a 3-8 team the season before, and the Big Ten's lowest-rated recruiting class.\n\n\"I was in coach Tiller’s first class. So prior to us getting there, they were nothing,\" safety Tim Upshur said. \"And I'll never forget our first game we played my freshman year was Toledo.\n\nPart 1: How coach Joe Tiller laid foundation for Purdue football's 2000 Rose Bowl team\n\nPart 2: Joe Tiller's coaching staff was 'equally as good' as Purdue football Rose Bowl team\n\nTo outsiders, it was same old Purdue. Tiller's postgame message was a sign these Boilermakers were anything but.\n\n\"We've got some work to do,\" he told the team.\n\nTiller also said the team Purdue would beat Notre Dame the following game. Whether he believed it or not is irrelevant. The players believed that Tiller believed. And then they believed.\n\nPurdue beat Notre Dame for the first time since 1985 in Tiller's second game as head coach on Sept. 13, 1997, seven days after losing his first to Toledo.\n\n\"It goes back to that cultural shift,\" offensive lineman Chukky Okobi said. \"You go back to '96 and we can’t beat anybody and all the sudden we beat Notre Dame in '97. What else can we do? That kind of became the mindset going forward. If we can beat this team, there’s no reason we can’t beat every team.\"\n\nWest Lafayette was abuzz over its football program for the first time in years.\n\n\"The first game I ever dressed for was '97 against Notre Dame and that was the infamous (game). We win and they throw the goal post in the Wabash (River),\" punter Scott Kurz said. \"We enjoyed the energy our fans brought. It caught a lot of teams off guard and it was a real special memory for all of us.\"\n\nNotre Dame was the first of six consecutive wins in what became a 9-3 season, capped by beating Oklahoma State in the Alamo Bowl.\n\nBetween 1997-99, Purdue, which hadn't posted a winning record since 1984 previously, went a combined 25-12.\n\n\"That's where the great deal of pride I have in this institution today is because I felt like I was a part of turning the tide and changing the narrative of what Purdue football is, what it was and would it could be,\" said former cornerback Lamar Conard, who was Purdue's running backs coach until a few weeks ago, and whose last season playing was 1999.\n\nAll that did was up the ante for that 2000 season, when Tiller's first Purdue recruits would be seniors.\n\n\"I remember our recruiting class coming in 1997, we were the last-place ranked recruiting class (in the Big Ten) coming in,\" quarterback Drew Brees said in an interview with Journal & Courier in 2015. \"But we made a commitment to one another that by the time we left Purdue, we were going to be Big Ten champs and we were going to the Rose Bowl. That’s exactly what we had the chance to do.\"\n\nNathan Baird and Sam King have the best Purdue sports coverage, and \n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Purdue football trip to Rose Bowl helped them envision Rose Bowl berth",

    "title": "CA judge rules Tesla lied about FSD, must fix marketing within 60 days",
    "description": "Tesla engaged in false advertising for its Full Self-Driving system. Unless it fixes the issues, its license to sell in CA will be suspended.",
    "fullText": "A California judge ruled late Tuesday afternoon that Tesla engaged in “deceptive marketing” in reference to its Full Self-Driving system, and that Tesla’s license to sell and produce cars in the state should be revoked for 30 days.\n\nHowever, the California DMV has said it will give Tesla 60 days to comply and fix its marketing before going through with the suspension.\n\nThe ruling is big news in a case that has been ongoing for years now.\n\nTesla has been selling level 2 driver assist software since 2016 which it calls “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), despite that this software did not (and still does not) make its cars capable of driving themselves.\n\nThis name has attracted much consternation over the years, becoming more absurd as each of Tesla’s predicted deadlines for the advent of full autonomy blow by.\n\nTesla also provides software under the name “Autopilot,” another term that evokes some level of autonomy, though perhaps not as explicitly as the aforementioned FSD. Tesla long held the position that this word is meant to evoke airplane-like systems that still require a pilot, but can just do most of the work for them.\n\nSo eventually, in 2021, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) officially started an investigation into Tesla’s marketing claims, to determine whether the company had lied to consumers.\n\nCalifornia found that the company was saying different things to the public than it was saying to the DMV.\n\nThe DMV then sent an official inquiry to Tesla in 2022, asking for it to respond to the claim that it was creating incorrect perceptions about the capabilities of its system. Tesla’s response stated that it had been allowed to lie about FSD for so long that it should get to keep going, which was apparently not persuasive enough to the courts, and the case was then slated for trial.\n\nDuring this time, the California legislature got involved as well, passing a law that specifically banned automakers from deceiving consumers into thinking vehicles have more autonomous capabilities than they do.\n\nWell, after all these investigations and waiting, we finally have an an answer, and the judge’s ruling makes it quite clear: Tesla lied to consumers about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nThe court looked at Tesla’s marketing claims and also at surveys of people exposed to those claims and their opinion of whether a Tesla would be able to drive itself, given the marketing messages put out by the company.\n\nIt found problems both with the word Autopilot and the phrase Full Self-Driving.\n\nThe word “Autopilot” was not found to be “unambiguously false,” but the court said that its use “follows a long but unlawful tradition of ‘intentionally (using) ambiguity to mislead consumers while maintaining some level of deniability about the intended meaning.'” The court found that a reasonable person could believe that a car on Autopilot doesn’t require their constant undivided attention, which is incorrect as the driver is still fully responsible for the vehicle.\n\nOn “Full Self-Driving,” the court was even more harsh. It found that this feature name is “actually, unambiguously false and counterfactual” (comically, Tesla tried to argue here that “no reasonable person” could believe that Full Self-Driving actually means Full Self-Driving).\n\nThe court noted other language used by Tesla, including marketing copy that said “the system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat,” and suggested that “legal reasons” are the only things holding Tesla back from full autonomy. Tesla tried to say that this was a statement of future intent, but the court found that its use of the present tense shows otherwise.\n\nTesla has repeatedly changed its wording around FSD, first calling it Full Self-Driving Capability, then changing that to Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to emphasize the need for a driver to supervise the vehicle. The court noted these changes, and then said it would not be a burden to force Tesla to change its marketing further to clarify that its cars do not drive themselves.\n\nWhich leads us to the proposed legal remedy: the court said that the DMV could suspend or revoke Tesla’s licenses for 30 days, stopping its ability to sell or build cars in the state.\n\nTesla’s first factory is in Fremont, California, where it still builds around half a million vehicles a year and employs some ~20,000 employees. Tesla says this remedy would be “draconian,” but the court said that without this option, there’s no reason to believe Tesla would stop its misrepresentations to the public.\n\nThe court also examined the possibility of financial restitution, but deemed that inappropriate. Since the case did not establish any quantifiable financial harm done by Tesla’s misrepresentation and noted the impracticality of accounting for that harm.\n\nThis ruling does not yet mean that Tesla can’t sell cars in California, which is its largest market in the US by far. The court noted that the DMV has the option of suspension or revocation, which the DMV can do at its discretion. And the DMV has said that it will allow Tesla 60 days to comply with the order before it takes action, and that it would focus on Tesla’s dealer license rather than its manufacturing license.\n\nThis would mean, specifically, that Tesla not refer to a level 2 driving system as “Autopilot” or using language that suggests these vehicles are autonomous. It will have to change its marketing materials and stop making public statements misleading the public about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nTesla said after the ruling that “sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” But we’ll see what happens in 60 days, and what sort of changes Tesla does or does not make to its deceptive marketing.\n\nTuesday’s ruling is just one of many legal cases against Tesla right now, specifically having to do with FSD. One relevant case is a class action lawsuit in California claiming Tesla misled customers about its cars self-driving capabilities. This ruling could provide fuel for that lawsuit, given a California judge has already gone on the record with an official determination that Tesla misled the public about FSD.\n\nThe 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year.

    "fullText": "California-based electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxi developer Archer Aviation is putting down roots on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company revealed its plans to build an engineering hub in South West England that will be operated by a new subsidiary, Archer Aviation UK Limited. The move adds to its primary manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia, which could also be complemented by production capabilities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\n\"The U.K. has the talent and industrial base to be a major player in driving the next era of advanced aerospace and defence,\" said Adam Goldstein, Archer's founder and CEO. \"Archer's plans to open a U.K. engineering hub underscores our commitment to being an integral part of the next-generation of aerospace and defence in the country.\"\n\nArcher also poached engineer Limhi Somerville from what would be its largest U.K. competitor-Vertical Aerospace, which last week unveiled its flagship eVTOL, Valo.\n\nLike Archer's Midnight, Valo is designed to carry up to four passengers on zero-emission flights in urban settings, producing a fraction of the noise of a helicopter. Somerville spent six years with Vertical and led its development of electric batteries and powertrains, most recently serving as director of engineering. He will join Archer's team in early 2026, the company said.\n\nAcquiring team members from competitors is a blueprint the company has deployed before. Earlier this year, for example, George Kivork, the former head of U.S. state and local policy for rival Joby Aviation, joined Archer as a general manager for the Los Angeles region.\n\nHowever, the strategy has gotten the company in some hot water. Joby in November sued both Archer and Kivork, alleging that its competitor used trade secrets from Kivork to undercut an exclusive deal it had planned to finalize. Archer has rejected the allegations.\n\nWisk Aero, the eVTOL arm of Boeing, sued Archer in 2021, also alleging that a former employee stole trade secrets. Archer promptly countersued. The companies ultimately settled for an undisclosed amount, and Boeing made an investment intended to fund the integration of Wisk's autonomy technology on future variants of Midnight.\n\nMidnight is a piloted, four-passenger eVTOL model with a cruise speed of about 150 mph, designed for 10-20-minute, 20-50 sm trips. Its six electric battery packs each power a pair of motors and propellers, half of which are capable of tilting to support both hover and forward flight.\n\nIn the U.S., Archer is working with United Airlines-which placed an order for up to 200 aircraft-and Southwest Airlines to build air taxi networks in major urban centers. It has shared potential route maps for New York, Miami, and Los Angeles, where it recently acquired Hawthorne Municipal Airport (KHHR) for $126 million.",

    "fullText": "To prevent the spread of a serious bacterial disease that infects citrus crops, United States officials are expanding two federal quarantine areas.\n\nAs reported by the Fresh Fruit Portal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has expanded the citrus greening quarantines for two separate counties in Southern California.\n\nAPHIS is expanding the quarantined area in the Capistrano Beach area of Orange County by 29 square miles and the Murrieta area of Riverside County by 129 square miles. The announcement of the expansion follows the positive detection of citrus greening in plant tissue samples collected from locations in both Orange and Riverside Counties.\n\nAccording to APHIS, there are currently no commercial citrus trees impacted by the expansion of the quarantined area in Orange County. However, 170 acres of commercial citrus trees have now been impacted by the citrus greening quarantine in Riverside County.\n\nThe quarantine expansions are coordinated with the California Department of Food and Agriculture. They aim to contain citrus greening by restricting the movement of citrus materials within the state, aligning with 7 CFR 301.76.\n\n\"This action is necessary to prevent the spread of citrus greening to non-infested areas of the United States,\" APHIS wrote in the release.\n\nThe bacterial disease is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid, an invasive insect species that was first documented in the U.S. in 1998. These invasive pests can wreak havoc on local ecosystems and economies by disrupting agricultural industries and interfering with native species.\n\nCitrus greening, in particular, can be devastating for citrus crops. It can lead to reduced yields, poor-quality fruit, and higher production costs. The bacteria can block nutrient flow in plants, stunting growth and killing roots. As noted by APHIS, there is currently no known cure for the disease.\n\nThis isn't the first time in 2025 that California has turned to drastic measures to deal with invasive insects. In September, portions of Santa Clara County were placed under quarantine by the California Department of Food and Agriculture after officials detected the invasive Mediterranean fruit fly.\n\n\"A quarantine is a way to minimize damage and stop the risk of spread by restricting the movement of fruits and vegetables,\" wrote the CDFA in a press release.\n\nDo you think fracking should be illegal in America?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The judge ruled Tesla should have to suspend manufacturing and sales in California for 30 days, but the DMV stayed those rulings for 90 days to allow Tesla to comply.",
    "fullText": "An administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\n\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.”\n\n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\n\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\n\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\n\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\n\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.",

    "description": "California's DMV ordered Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" within 90 days, or face a month-long dealership suspension.",
    "fullText": "Tesla may have to rebrand Autopilot.\n\nSteve Gordon, the Director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a media briefing on Tuesday that Tesla has 90 days to amend its advertising language or face a 30-day suspension from selling in California.\n\nGordon said on Tuesday that the DMV is specifically asking Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" to clarify that the company has advanced driving systems, which do not equate to an automated system or an autonomous vehicle. Changes must be made within 90 days, or the DMV will \"enforce the cessation of sales.\"\n\n\"My guess is that they will pursue some remedy,\" said Gordon of what Tesla might do next, \"but the easiest one for them is just to come into compliance.\"\n\nIn response to the DMV's decision, a Tesla spokesperson told Business Insider that this is \"a 'consumer protection' order about the use of the term 'Autopilot' in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nOn November 21, Administrative Judge Juliet E. Cox made a proposed decision about whether Tesla has misled consumers into thinking its cars are more capable of driving themselves than they actually are, and transmitted it to the DMV for consideration. The document containing the proposal, however, has been withheld from the public and won't be released till December 22.\n\nGordon said during the Tuesday briefing that Cox recommended both a suspension of Tesla's license to sell and to manufacture in California. The DMV, however, decided not to pursue a suspension of the license to manufacture and put a temporary 90-day stay on the suspension of the license to sell for Tesla to make amends.\n\n\"They're very important to the state,\" said Gordon of Tesla. \"We want to be fair to them and give them a chance to see if they can find a resolution now that there is a ruling from the administrative law judge.\"\n\n\"If you look at the Q3 report of this year, Tesla has the top-selling car, the Model Y, in its segment,\" Gordon added. \"We felt that the leverage via the sales channel was sufficient to get compliance.\"\n\nThe notice to Tesla follows a weeklong hearing in July at the administrative court in Oakland. In 2022, the DMV sued Tesla, accusing the carmaker of misleading consumers through Tesla's advertisements and by naming its driver assistance technologies \"Full Self-Driving\" and \"Autopilot.\"\n\nTesla, which had a rocky year, denied that the company had ever tried to conceal the fact that its vehicles cannot fully drive themselves.\n\nThe DMV sought to suspend Tesla's ability to sell cars in the state for at least 30 days and award consumers monetary damages.\n\nThe CA DMV wrote in its complaint that on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, Tesla's website advertised its FSD driver assistance system as being \"designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver's seat.\"\n\nTesla's lawyers said during the hearing that the company has always informed buyers that they \"cannot fully rely\" on FSD or Autopilot.\n\n\"Cars with Full Self-Driving capabilities are currently not capable of driving themselves,\" said Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, during the hearing.",

    "fullText": "Fallout returns with a new journey into the Mojave Wasteland.\n\n on December 16, 2025 at 6:00PM PST\n\nSPOILERS for Fallout Season 2 Episode 1: The Man Who Knew to follow:\n\nThe last time we saw Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), The Ghoul aka Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins), and beloved pup CX404, their situation looked dire.\n\nLucy had learned her father Hank (Kyle MacLachlan) was responsible for the destruction of Shady Sands, The Brotherhood of Steel was in a heated battle with the New California Republic over control of Griffith Observatory, and Cooper realized that Hank held the answers to the whereabouts of his family. While Hank slipped out in the ensuing chaos and headed to New Vegas, Lucy decided to join Cooper in his quest for answers, which led them into unknown and dangerous territory.\n\nThe first episode of Fallout Season 2, \"The Man Who Knew,\" opens with a brief Pre-War flashback that shows the public protesting against RobCo industries. The scene then takes us inside a bar where a mysterious stranger (Justin Theroux) manages to taunt a group of unemployed workers about how RobCo industries founder Mr. House is more powerful than the government. They then follow him outside, where he attaches a device to the back of one of their heads in return for millions of dollars. Using this device, he’s able to command the man to attack his friends with a baseball bat, but when the mind-controlled man begins to turn against the mysterious stranger, the device makes his head explode in gory fashion.\n\nJumping back to the present, we see that Cooper is captured in Novac by the Great Khans, one of the factions running rampant in the Mojave Wasteland. But when they’re about to execute him, Lucy reveals herself in an iconic sniper perch from Fallout: New Vegas and exposes their plan to rob the Khans of their bottlecaps. She fails a dialogue check and chaos ensues; Cooper is forced to intervene in bloody fashion, reminding audiences once again why he’s one of the best gunslingers in the Wasteland.\n\nIt’s not long after this fight that Cooper reveals that New Vegas survived The Great War, thanks to a missile system designed by Mr. House, which shot the bombs out of the sky. This includes a brief pre-war flashback in which Cooper learns of Vault-Tec and House’s plans for The Great War. He struggles to get his daughter to safety.\n\nChecking in on the residents of Vault 33 in the present, we find Overseer Pearson (Leslie Uggams), who mentions that the vault's water purification chip is broken. Meanwhile, in Vault 32, Stephanie Harper (Annabel O’Hagan) is adjusting to her new life as Overseer and dealing with the needs of her residents and new arrivals from Vault 33. By her side, with child in hand, is Chet (Dave Register), Lucy’s cousin, who is struggling to adjust to his new role as the stepfather of Stephanie’s baby, and dismayed at the mere suggestion that the child be named “Chet Jr.”\n\nFinally, we cut to Vault 31, where Norm (Moises Arias), Lucy’s brother, is held captive by the robo-brain of Bud Askins, a junior vice president of Vault-Tec Industries, after discovering the vault is secretly housing the Vault-Tec executives from before The Great War.\n\nLucy and Cooper continue to follow the trail of dead bodies left in Hank’s wake. They come across a Starlight Drive-In that’s secretly housing Vault 24. Upon further inspection, they find the vault door has been opened and the inside is covered with overgrown vegetation.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper head inside, we get a Pre-War flashback of Cooper reporting his Vault-Tec findings to Lee Moldaver (Sarita Choudhury), who led the NCR during the battle of Griffith Observatory. Moldaver reveals to Cooper that his wife plans to sell Cold Fusion, an infinite power source, to Mr. House. That and his anti-bomb missile system will make him one of the most powerful men in the world once the bombs drop. Knowing this can’t happen, she asks Cooper to assassinate Mr. House--an event we know now never comes to be).\n\nBack in Vault 31, Norm is growing weaker and weaker from a lack of food and water. Bud offers him salvation in the form of going into Hank’s now-empty cryo chamber. With time running out and with few options, Norm decides to make a rash decision and wakes up all the Vault-Tec executives from their slumber. We see the massive number of chambers begin to open up.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper explore Vault 24, they come across numerous communist corpses and find Russian propaganda playing. Lucy realizes the corpses are actually Americans who were being brainwashed to become communists, possibly as a result of one of Vault-Tec's many sick experiments on vault-dwellers. Deeper in the vault, they find a Great Khan with a mind control device similar to the one the mysterious stranger used at the start of the episode. He delivers a message for Lucy straight from her father: “I fix everything. Go home, Sugar Bomb.” Before they can react, his head explodes into gory viscera.\n\nElsewhere, Hank arrives at a secret Vault-Tec facility and changes out of his stolen power armor into something a bit more business appropriate. After enjoying a damn fine cup of coffee, he begins to record a message for an unknown recipient, promising that his work will continue. In a display case is the mysterious stranger’s mind control device with what looks like smaller and smaller upgraded models alongside it, ending the episode.\n\nFallout returns with a bang! While we got answers about the aftermath of the battle for Griffith Observatory, the quest into the Mojave Wasteland provides even more mysteries. What’s Hank truly up to? What will happen to Norm when all of the Vault-Tec executives wake up? Why is New Vegas so important? Who is the mysterious stranger who created the mind control device? We didn’t even get an update on Maximus (Aaron Moten) and the Brotherhood of Steel. So while we rejoined our comrades in this exciting new setting, there’s still plenty more to discover as we dive deeper into Fallout Season 2.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

It’s unclear if “Amazon-type logistics centers” includes Amazon itself, its competitors or other industries.\n\nQuestions also remain about the Louisiana arrest, as officials said that person is linked to a Turtle Island subgroup created by Carroll called the “Order of the Black Lotus” but was “not directly tied” to the Southern California plot.\n\nIt’s possible more arrests are coming, as Essayli said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“As we review that evidence, if we determine there were any other individuals who knew about this or provided any assistance, we will obviously charge them as well,” Essayli said.",

    "fullText": "Southern California is basking in sunshine and unseasonably warm temperatures this week, but forecasters say a holiday twist is on the way.\n\n“We’re still seeing fog for some coastal spots, but inland areas are warming up above average once again,” KTLA weather anchor Kacey Montoya said Monday, noting highs in the low 80s for the Los Angeles Basin. “It’s about 20 degrees above average today, even warmer tomorrow.”\n\nThe National Weather Service said highs will stay in the low 80s through Thursday before cooling into the 70s by the weekend. Air quality remains moderate for most of the region, with a mandatory wood-burning ban in effect through Tuesday for the South Coast Air Basin.\n\nThe NWS long-range forecast shows a Pacific storm could arrive as early as Dec. 22, with snow levels dropping in mountain communities – potentially complicating holiday travel.\n\n“There is a system that is very likely to bring us some widespread precipitation,” Montoya said. “Models don’t agree on when the rain begins or how much.”\n\nBut meteorologists caution that those hoping for a big boost to ski resorts may be disappointed.\n\n“Next week’s stormy pattern does not appear to be a big snowmaker for our area as the upper level trough will pull in moisture from the southwest initially, then a plume from the south joins in on the fun,” the Weather Service said in a bulletin. “Thus temperatures will remain too warm for any significant snow.”",

    "fullText": "For Carson Palmer, the former NFL quarterback and head football coach of the No. 8 Santa Margarita Catholic Eagles, their season officially ended this past Saturday when they defeated No. 17 De La Salle, 47-13, for California’s Open Division state championship.\n\nIn an interview after the win over De La Salle, Palmer stated that he thought his team was playing its best football of the season and wishes his alma mater had one more game left, maybe against a team out of the state of Georgia or another nationally ranked team.\n\n“It’s been an unreal year, from start to finish,” Palmer said to the Los Angeles Times’ Eric Sondheimer. “With the senior class, it has been spectacular. Could not be more proud of these guys, Could not be prouder [of] our coaching staff and support system. This is [an] unbelievable run. We are playing good football. I wish we had a couple more [games] left. Maybe [a] team in Georgia. Maybe somebody else out there.”\n\nThe season might be over for Santa Margarita Catholic, but when Palmer points to his club is playing its best football of the season, he’s got a valid point.\n\nThe Eagles’ recent run of victories includes impressive wins over nationally ranked teams like De La Salle, Corona Centennial, Orange Lutheran, Mater Dei and Sierra Canyon. Palmer mentioning his wishes of his team possibly playing a team out of Georgia or somewhere else possibly points to seeing themselves crowned as a national champion of high school football.\n\nOne would have to wonder what a matchup between Santa Margarita Catholic and a team like Carrollton (Ga.), Buford (Ga.) or St. Frances Academy (Md.), which won the Overtime Nationals championship last week, would’ve been like. All we’re left with is to imagine what that could’ve turned into.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.
