Cracks inside the GOP conference were stark this week as a member of Johnson’s own leadership team openly accused him of lying, rank-and-file Republicans acted unilaterally to force votes and a leadership-backed bill faltered.  “I certainly think that the current leadership and specifically the speaker needs to change the way that he approaches the job,” GOP Rep.
