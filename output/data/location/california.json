    "fullText": "Rain poured down on the iconic Rose Parade on Thursday for the first time in 20 years, as flood warnings and evacuation orders in Southern California joined snow squalls and frigid temperatures in the country's midsection to mark the first day of 2026.\n\nMarching bands, floats and throngs of spectators were soaked by one to two inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) of New Year’s Day rain at the 137th Rose Parade in Pasadena. The mercury stood at a chilly 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14.4 degrees Celsius) at the 8 a.m. start of the parade.\n\nAcross the country, in New York City, hats and gloves were as necessary as noisemakers at the city's New Year's Eve ball drop, where temperatures near freezing appeared to be the coldest in 10 years.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people gather along the nearly six-mile (10-kilometer) route in Pasadena, where the two-hour parade kicked off. Millions more watch on national television. Organizers at the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, the group that organizes the parade ahead of the Rose Bowl college football game, said they made only small changes to accommodate the weather, such as the tops being up on convertibles carrying grand marshal Earvin “Magic” Johnson and other VIPs.\n\nRain forecasts for the Rose Parade, which had been dry for 20 years, grew all week. On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for all California counties and a coastal flood advisory through Sunday afternoon along much of the Pacific Coast near San Francisco.\n\nMeanwhile, residents in the areas hit hardest by last year's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires were under evacuation warnings.\n\nIn New York City, the sun came out ahead of Mayor Zohran Mamdani's inaugural celebration, but other areas of the Northeast and Midwest were hit by an Alberta clipper storm and trailing Arctic front that brought snow squalls and high winds.\n\nConditions varied widely — from snow showers to heavier squalls — from Wisconsin through northern Illinois and Michigan and into northern New Jersey, southeastern New York and New England.\n\nAbout a quarter of flights were delayed out of both San Diego International Airport and Boston Logan, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.",

    "description": "California's DMV said some legal immigrants had been issued Real IDs that did not expire at the same time as their authorization to remain in the country.",
    "fullText": "The California Department of Motor Vehicles said this week that approximately 325,000 Californians will be required to replace their Real ID licenses because of a software error.\n\nIn the coming weeks, DMV officials said, about 1.5% of those holding Real IDs will be notified that they “need to take action” to “ensure continued compliance with federal REAL ID regulations.”\n\n“The DMV is informing affected individuals of the steps they need to take,” officials said in a news release issued Wednesday. Fees associated with reissuing the IDS will be waived for those affected.\n\nDMV officials said the problem was discovered after a review of technology systems revealed that some legal immigrants had been issued Real IDs that did not expire at the same time as their authorization to remain in the country.\n\nThe Real ID Act was signed into law in 2005 and established security standards for state-issued IDs for things like boarding planes. But implementation was repeatedly delayed, and the requirement finally went into effect in May of 2025. DMV officials said they discovered that a “small subset” of Real IDs issued to lawful permanent residents “applied the standard credential renewal interval in some cases, instead of the expiration of a REAL ID holder’s authorized stay.”\n\n“We proactively reviewed our records, identified a legacy system issue from 2006, and are notifying impacted customers with clear guidance on how to maintain a valid California-issued credential,” DMV Director Steve Gordon said. “For nearly 99% of REAL ID holders, no action is required. The DMV remains committed to serving all Californians and ensuring REAL ID credentials meet federal standards.”\n\nOfficials said the problem came about because of “legacy coding from 2006.” But the release added that all those who had been issued Real IDs received them only after the federal system had verified their lawful presence in the country, and that no one who was undocumented got one.\n\nA.

    "description": "Thiel Capital, founded by, billionaire Peter Thiel, said it opened a new office in Miami.",
    "fullText": "Thiel Capital is expanding in Miami.\n\nOn Wednesday, the private investment firm founded by the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel said it has opened a new office in Miami.\n\nThiel Capital's press release said that the new office is located in Wynwood, a former warehouse district that has become a hub for startups, investors, and cultural institutions. The lease was signed in December, and the new office will \"complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles,\" the firm said.\n\nThe announcement comes as a proposal for a wealth tax was floated in California.\n\nMiami's startup and finance scene heated up during the pandemic and in the years that followed, with many big firms from California and New York relocating their headquarters and expanding their offices there.\n\nSan Francisco-based Founders Fund, the venture capital firm cofounded by Thiel, has had an office in Miami since 2021. In 2020, Thiel bought an $18 million house in Miami's Venetian Islands.\n\nCalifornia is debating a proposed wealth tax that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents with net worths exceeding $1 billion, to be paid over five years.\n\nThe wealth tax still needs 870,000 signatures to even make it to the ballot in November 2026, where it would then be approved or rejected by voters at the ballot box. However, billionaires have already been critical of the plan and warned of an exodus of the wealthy.\n\nIt was proposed by SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West and designed to offset anticipated cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance.\n\nIn comparison to an income tax, a wealth tax is a levy on all of an individual's net worth, because it is difficult to quantify the annual income of a person who doesn't earn normal paychecks but has other assets that gain value every year. The tax would apply to the roughly 200 billionaires residing in California, which has a total population of over 39 million people. The SEIU-UHW estimates that the one-time tax will bring in $100 billion over five years for the state.\n\nCelebrity attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of his clients, warning that his clients will \"permanently relocate\" if the California wealth tax passes.\n\nIzzy Gardon, a spokesperson for Newsom's office, told Business Insider that the governor has \"consistently opposed state-level wealth taxes\" and that a wealth tax, \"if implemented at a state-only level, they drive a race to the bottom.\"\n\nIf passed, the wealth tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Put your hands down, class, I know what your question is.\n\nHas a Louisville team ever before been whistled for 16 fouls in a half?\n\nWhich U of L was in the opening twenty at venerable Haas Pavilion.\n\nMy definitive answer after checking the media guide is a definitive probably not.\n\nOn December 10, 1953, the Cards were flagged for 43 total in a 71-78 L at Siena.\n\nOK, it is for sure. The laws of mathematics dictate they must have had more than that in one, probably both halves.\n\nThe Cards, despite being -12 at the line in the 1st, led by 14 at the break, 48-34.\n\nThanks to coming out scorching, draining their first five shots, three Sananda Fru deuces, and a pair of triples, one by Ryan Conwell, the other by Isaac McKneely.\n\nCal never pulled closer than 7, and the Cardinals never led by less than double digits after the 12:10 mark of the opening stanza.\n\nOK, here’s my question: WTF was Vangelis Zougris doing in the game just past midway through the 2d?\n\nDuring his three minute stint, the Golden Bears went on a 9-0 thrust.\n\nVZ was technically only -9 (the only negative +/- for a Cardinal). But technically he was really -14. But Pat Kelsey wisely benched him after he committed one of the stupidest deadball Ts I’ve ever witnessed. Which resulted in five more California tallies, two FTs and a trey.\n\nThe bracing 14 point run cut the margin to 73-62 with 6:27 left.\n\nThen  U of L’s maturity reigned.\n\nAdrian Wooley scored a second chance deuce, then followed it with a triple.\n\nThe seven point skein steadied the situation.\n\nU of L — playing shorthanded without Mikel Brown or Kasean Pryor — kept Cal’s measure the rest of the way.\n\nIt was simply one of the oddest twenty point victories I can recall.\n\nMidway through the 2d, the Cardinals led 68-43 and were teetering. Ryan Conwell had just been called for his fourth foul. Woeful marksmanship after intermission to that point. 7/19. 2/10. But the Bears, perhaps the most mediocre 12-1 squad in memory, were more inept. 5/19. 1/9. For the half, U of L was actually +4 at the line at that moment.\n\nSoon thereafter came the Zougrisian Abominata.\n\nSteadiness and that much appreciated level headedness prevailed.\n\nLouisville only committed 9 infractions in the 2d, one less than the home team.\n\nFor the tilt, the Cards were +19 off the glass, +20 in the paint.\n\nThough Conwell led Louisville in scoring with 26, for my money, it was the Hadley glue and the Wooley bully — couldn’t help myself — that were most key.\n\nJH had 11 with 9 boards and 3 assists. AW had 21, many were important answers and thrust stoppers.\n\nSanny Fru was also boffo. He fashioned his first double double with 13 and 14.\n\nKobe Rodgers was a steady, calming presence. As usual. Khani Rooths was strong in his 18 minutes. And McKneely remains way more an all around positive than most expected.\n\nOvercoming a cross country trip, significant foul trouble, the absence of two key ballers, in your conference opener on the road for a 20 point W is not to be sneezed at.\n\nNext: a trip down to Silicon Valley for a date with Stanford Friday night in Palo Alto.",

    "description": "Bill Ackman, Palmer Luckey, Garry Tan, and more are sharing their opinions on a California billionaire tax proposal.",
    "fullText": "Some of the biggest names in business are speaking up about California's billionaire tax proposal.\n\nThe measure proposed a one-time 5% tax for California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion. If the proposal receives enough signatures, it would appear on the state ballot in November.\n\nIf the proposal passes, the tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nProposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union, the bill attempts to fill a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nCalifornia is home to some of the biggest companies — in both value and prestige — in the US. The state boasts Hollywood and Silicon Valley, although some of the industries' key players have relocated.\n\nIn a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom obtained by Business Insider, attorney Alex Spiro wrote that his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the tax becomes law. Spiro has previously represented billionaires and celebrities.\n\nHere's how several business leaders and politicians have reacted to the tax proposal:\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Holdings wrote Monday on X that he was \"opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property,\" which can have \"unintended and negative consequences.\"\n\nHowever, he said he's in favor of a \"fairer tax system.\"\n\nFor example, Ackman wrote that an individual who had amassed a billion dollars or \n\n\"One shouldn't be able to live and spend like a billionaire and pay no tax,\" Ackman wrote.\n\nAs for California's \"budget problems,\" Ackman wrote that the issue wasn't a lack of tax revenue — it was about \"how the money is being spent.\"\n\nThe White House AI and crypto czar took aim at California's government in an X post on Sunday.\n\nRed states like Texas and Florida don't employ state income taxes, let alone wealth taxes, Sacks wrote. \"Democrats steal everything, then blame job creators for their 'greed,'\" he wrote.\n\nSacks said in an October episode of the \"All-In\" podcast, which he cohosts, that a wealth tax \"always backfires,\" because tax benefits are outweighed by wealthy residents leaving.\n\nSacks threatened to leave the state, analogizing steady tax increases to boiling a frog on the podcast.\n\n\"I'm going to have to jump out of the pot with this,\" he said.\n\nThe Congressman for California's 17th district, which covers much of Silicon Valley, said that the proposal was \"good for American innovation.\"\n\nAfter receiving thousands of comments on a Friday post bidding a sarcastic goodbye to those threatening to leave the state, Khanna explained his support in a seven-paragraph X post on Saturday.\n\nHe wrote that Nvidia would be built all over again, even with the wealth tax.\n\n\"Jensen [Huang] wasn't thinking I won't start this company because I may have to one day pay a 1% tax on my billions,\" Khanna wrote. \"He built here because the talent is here.\"\n\nKhanna argued that innovation would be further stifled by the \"political dysfunction and social unrest\" that comes with wide wealth gaps.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, wrote that the representative has \"always supported a modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have healthcare.\"\n\n\"He has advocated for common sense workarounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock,\" Drory wrote.\n\nThe Oculus founder and Anduril cofounder wrote in a Sunday X post that the tax would force founders to \"sell huge chunks of our companies.\"\n\nLuckey wrote that he made money from Oculus — which he sold to Facebook in 2014 — and paid millions in taxes on it. Then he used the \"remainder\" to start Anduril, he wrote.\n\n\"Now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash,\" Luckey wrote.\n\nLuckey also wrote that the policy made no provision for companies that funnel revenue back to research and development, rather than paying cash incomes sizable enough to cover the tax.\n\n\"You are effectively forcing companies to immediately pivot into profit obsession over mission or long-term sustainability,\" he wrote.\n\nThe CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator wrote in a Saturday X post that the tax would \"kill little tech in California.\"\n\nUnicorn startup founders become a \"paper billionaire\" — as in, having cash on hand — around the $5 billion valuation point, Tan wrote.\n\nThe proposed tax is on unrealized gains, meaning founders would be put on the line even before their wealth is liquid, Tan wrote.\n\nIf the tax passed, Tan wrote that Y Combinator would consider opening Austin or Cambridge programs.\n\nThe Vermont senator has long been a proponent of taxes on the wealthy, introducing a bill in 2019 that aimed to halve the wealth of billionaires over a 15-year period.\n\nWhile Sanders didn't explicitly comment on the California proposal, he posted Monday on X broadly supporting wealth taxes.\n\n\"We can respect innovation & entrepreneurship, but we cannot respect the extraordinary greed that now exists,\" Sanders wrote. \"We need a wealth tax.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO reposted another user's X post that commented on the tax, saying that his stocks weren't wealth.\n\nMusk wrote in his Tuesday post that his \"wealth\" was mostly tied up in Tesla and SpaceX shares.\n\n\"This means my 'wealth' can only increase due to producing more products and services for the public,\" he wrote.\n\nWhile not directly commenting on the California tax, Musk wrote that he was a \"maker,\" unlike \"taker\" politicians like Sanders.\n\nMusk said in 2020 that he had moved from California to Texas.\n\nThe governor of California has spoken against the wealth tax. At The New York Times' Dealbook conference in December, Newsom said that California had to stay competitive with other states.\n\n\"People of that status, they already have two or three homes outside the state,\" he said. \"You've got to be pragmatic about it.\"\n\nIf the tax passes as a ballot measure, Newsom would not have the ability to veto it.",

But I can’t speak exactly to what the motive would be.”\n\nOwen Roth, one of Michael Abatti’s attorneys, said his client surrendered to law enforcement, agreed to be extradited to Arizona and remains innocent under the law. “Our client is in his mid-60s and has significant health issues, and we continue to worry about his well-being,” Roth said. “We ask the public to respect his privacy and constitutional rights and reiterate that this case will be decided based on the evidence by a jury.” An autopsy report released Monday said Kerri Abatti’s cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nThe report said she was found unconscious on the floor near her kitchen by her nephew, who told investigators he heard a loud sound before finding her. When investigators searched the home they found a “circular defect” on a window and determined “a gunshot likely originated from the yard outside the home,” the autopsy report said.\n\nThe Associated Press left a message for the Navajo County Sheriff’s Office for further explanation. The medical examiner’s office in Coconino County, which conducted the autopsy, directed questions about the report to a Navajo County official, and the AP also left a message for the official. A descendant of early Latter-day Saints settlers who helped found Pinetop in the 1880s, Kerri had filed for divorce, with proceedings pending in California at the time of her death.\n\nAuthorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife’s death.\n\nMichael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops. His grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region’s early settlers and his father helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association.\n\nMichael Abatti served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.\n\nThe Abattis, who married in 1992 and had three children, were sparring over finances. Kerri told the court the couple had lived an affluent lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned property in three states, vacationed internationally and sent their children to private school.\n\nKerri initially received $5,000 monthly temporary spousal support. She later sought an increase, citing struggles to maintain her standard of living as well as keep up the Arizona property. She also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney’s fees, court filings showed.\n\nMichael Abatti eventually agreed to raise support to $6,400 monthly, despite having countered in a court filing that poor farming years had reduced his income. He blamed market shifts favoring Ukrainian crops, rising shipping costs and harsh weather.",

    "fullText": "More than 60 million people across the U.S. are under winter weather alerts as a powerful storm system targets the Northeast after Christmas, while a separate atmospheric river continues to batter California with flooding rain, high winds and dangerous conditions.\n\nForecasters warn the systems could disrupt flights and road travel as millions of Americans head home after the holidays.\n\nThe severe weather is expected to unfold over several days, with impacts stretching from the West Coast to the Northeast. Forecasters say conditions on the ground could change quickly, affecting everything from short drives to long-distance travel. Here’s what to know about the most affected regions.\n\nThe tristate area is expected to bear the brunt of a major winter storm on Friday, with snow, sleet and freezing rain forecast to create hazardous travel conditions. Accumulating snow is forecast to hit New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — where a state of emergency has been declared — beginning Friday through early Saturday. Some forecast models suggest that parts of New York and New Jersey will see up to 9 inches of snow, depending on the storm’s track.\n\nThe storm is already disrupting air travel in the region. As of Friday morning, at least 1,300 flights across the U.S. had been canceled, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware, with delays expected to grow as the storm intensifies.\n\nSnowfall totals of roughly 1 to 6 inches are expected across northeastern Pennsylvania, much of New Jersey, large portions of New York state and parts of southern and central New England, with higher amounts possible in elevated areas north and west of New York City.\n\nThe system is also expected to bring sleet and freezing rain to parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and northern Virginia. A wintry mix is likely in cities including Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.\n\nOn the West Coast, California is facing dangerous conditions from a powerful atmospheric river system bringing flooding rain, high winds and heavy mountain snow to the state.\n\nWith atmospheric rivers, intense rainfall, and strong winds ahead, I’m declaring a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties to activate emergency authorities and preposition resources to keep our communities safe. pic.twitter.com/C3eLImPkwx\n\n— Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) December 24, 2025\n\nThe storm has already turned deadly, with at least three deaths reported in Southern California.\n\nParts of Southern California saw record-breaking rainfall earlier this week, with some locations seeing their wettest Christmas Eve or Christmas-week totals in decades.\n\nThe prolonged rainfall has increased the threat of mudslides, particularly in areas recently burned by wildfires. Officials have urged residents to avoid flooded roadways and to be prepared to evacuate if conditions worsen.\n\nAt higher elevations, the same storm system has delivered dangerous winter weather to the Sierra Nevada, making mountain travel hazardous across parts of California and western Nevada.\n\nAvalanche warnings were issued for parts of the Sierra as heavy snow and strong winds created unstable conditions in the mountains. Forecasters say 5 to 10 feet of snow could pile up in some high-elevation areas, significantly increasing avalanche risk and making travel especially dangerous through the weekend.\n\nThe Sierra Avalanche Center has issued a Backcountry Avalanche Watch for the backcountry areas around the Greater Lake Tahoe region as high avalanche danger is expected Thursday.

The American Automobile Association estimates that more than 122 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles during the end-of-year holiday period, increasing the potential for widespread delays as severe weather moves across the country.",

    "fullText": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — California this week dropped a lawsuit officials filed against the Trump administration over the federal government's withdrawing of $4 billion for the state's long-delayed high-speed rail project.\n\nThe U.S. Transportation Department slashed funds for the bullet train aimed at connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles in July. The Trump administration has said the California High-Speed Rail Authority had “ no viable plan ” to complete a large segment of the project in the farm-rich Central Valley.\n\nThe authority quickly filed a lawsuit, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom calling the federal government's decision “a political stunt to punish California.”\n\nThe authority said this week that it would focus on other funding sources to complete the project, which is estimated to cost more than $100 billion.\n\n“This action reflects the State’s assessment that the federal government is not a reliable, constructive, or trustworthy partner in advancing high-speed rail in California,” an authority spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe Transportation Department did not respond to a request for comment. President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have both previously criticized the project as a “train to nowhere.”\n\n“The Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social in July. “This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.”\n\nThe authority's decision to drop the lawsuit comes as the group seeks private investors to support the bullet train. The project recently secured $1 billion in annual funding from the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045.\n\nThe program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.\n\nThe rail authority said its shift in focus away from federal funding offers “a new opportunity.”\n\n“Moving forward without the Trump administration’s involvement allows the Authority to pursue proven global best practices used successfully by modern high-speed rail systems around the world,” a spokesperson said in a statement.",

    "fullText": "WRIGHTWOOD, Calif. (AP) — A strong storm system that brought relentless winds, rain and snowfall to California this week was expected to ease Friday, but there was still a risk of high surf along the coast, flash flooding near Los Angeles and avalanches in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nWaves near the San Francisco Bay Area could reach up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) Friday, parts of Southern California were at risk of flooding, and avalanches could hit the Lake Tahoe area, officials warned. Residents were told to be ready to evacuate the mountain town of Wrightwood about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles because of mudslides.\n\nAtmospheric rivers carried massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The storms were blamed for at least two deaths earlier in the week.\n\nThe system brought the wettest Christmas season to downtown Los Angeles in 54 years, the National Weather Service said.\n\nRoads in the 5,000-resident town of Wrightwood were covered in rocks, debris and thick mud on Thursday. With power out, a gas station and coffee shop running on generators were serving as hubs for residents and visitors.\n\n“It’s really a crazy Christmas,” said Jill Jenkins, who was spending the holiday with her 13-year-old grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo.\n\nLopiccolo said the family almost evacuated the previous day, when water washed away a chunk of their backyard. But they decided to stay and still celebrated the holiday. Lopiccolo got a new snowboard and e-bike.\n\n“We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights,” he said.\n\nDavey Schneider hiked a mile and a half (1.6 kilometers) through rain and floodwater up to his shins from his Wrightwood residence Wednesday to rescue cats from his grandfather’s house.\n\n“I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” Schneider said Thursday. “Fortunately, they all lived. They’re all okay — just a little bit scared.”\n\nArlene Corte said roads in town turned into rivers, but her house was not damaged.\n\n“It could be a whole lot worse,” she said. “We’re here talking.”\n\nWith more rain on the way, more than 150 firefighters were stationed in the area, said San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Shawn Millerick.\n\n“We’re ready,” he said. “It’s all hands on deck at this point.”\n\nA falling tree killed a San Diego man Wednesday, news outlets reported. Farther north, a Sacramento sheriff’s deputy died in what appeared to be a weather-related crash.\n\nAreas along the coast, including Malibu, were under a flood watch until Friday afternoon, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSouthern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters), with even \n\nMore wind and heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, where gusts created “near white-out conditions” and made mountain pass travel treacherous.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared emergencies in six counties to allow state assistance.\n\nThe state deployed resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.",

    "fullText": "Heavy rain and fierce winds from an atmospheric storm slammed Southern California on Wednesday, flooding roads and triggering mudslides as authorities urged parts of the region to evacuate.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties on Wednesday. Some areas had already received 4 to 8 inches of rain by Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAnother wave of the storm was expected to hit on Christmas Day, with flood and wind advisories for \"life-threatening\" storm conditions from the National Weather Service remaining in effect until Thursday afternoon.\n\nOver 163,000 homes and businesses across California were still without power on Christmas morning, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Redding Police Department reported one storm-related fatality in Northern California. Two more deaths occurred in South Sacramento and San Diego, CNN reported.\n\nThe storms are affecting the entire state, from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\n\nThe storms began on Christmas Eve, with the Weather Prediction Center warning that a \"dangerous scenario\" was on the way.\n\nPer CNN, 15 million people were still in the moderate-risk zone for flooding on Christmas Day.\n\nThe airport saw 3 inches of rainfall on the 24th.\n\nAccording to CNN, emergency crews were pulling people from flooded cars and homes, and some people even had to be rescued from their roofs via helicopter.\n\nSarah Bailey, a resident of the Wrightwood area for two decades, told the Times this was the worst flooding she'd seen.\n\nChristopher Prater, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department, told the outlet they'd received \"dozens\" of rescue calls on Wednesday night.\n\nA Pineapple Express is an atmospheric river, a band of concentrated water vapor. These \"rivers\" are responsible for 30 to 50% of California's rainfall.\n\nThe power outages are focused in Northern California, according to The New York Times.\n\nAny additional rainfall that comes on the 25th and 26th, even if it's less intense, could cause more flooding and debris to wash away, especially in areas that were devastated by the LA wildfires earlier this year.\n\n\"I am urging all Angelenos to stay safe and be extremely careful on the roads if you absolutely must travel,\" Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles said in a statement. \"Please do not take this storm lightly.\"",

    "fullText": "HONOLULU (AP) — Backup quarterback Drew Weaver threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Nick Cenacle with 10 seconds left, and Hawaii rallied for a 35-31 victory over California in a thrilling Hawaii Bowl on Wednesday night.\n\nWeaver entered the game after Micah Alejado took a hard hit on the previous play. With the Rainbow Warriors (9-4) in range for a tying field goal, coach Timmy Chang took a shot at the end zone, and Cenacle got between two defensive backs and made the contested catch.\n\nChang, Hawaii’s fourth-year coach who had a record-setting career as the Rainbow Warriors’ quarterback from 2000-04, led his program to its first nine-win season since 2019 — when Nick Rolovich, currently Cal’s interim coach, guided Hawaii to a 10-5 record.\n\nAlejado finished 32 of 46 for 274 yards and three touchdowns, helping Hawaii rally from an early 21-0 deficit. Pofele Ashlock had 14 catches for 123 yards and two TDs for the Rainbow Warriors, who scored 22 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nCal (7-6) pulled ahead 31-28 with 1:57 left on a 1-yard touchdown run by Hawaii-born freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele, who finished with 343 yards passing and a touchdown.\n\nAlejado’s 17-yard touchdown pass to Brandon White with 7:19 left gave Hawaii a 28-24 lead. The Rainbow Warriors tied it early in the fourth quarter when Alejado connected with Ashlock for their second TD and then completed a 2-point conversion pass to Cam Barfield.\n\nCal took a 21-0 lead early in the second quarter on Anthony League’s 8-yard TD run.\n\nCal was picked to finish third-to-last in the Atlantic Coast Conference preseason media poll, but finished the season tied for seventh in the ACC. Coach Justin Wilcox was fired last month and will be replaced next season by Oregon defensive coordinator Tosh Lupoi. Sagapolutele has committed to staying with the program in 2026.\n\nHawaii has plenty to build on as it enters Chang’s fifth season. Although leading receiver Jackson Harris announced his intention to transfer and did not play Wednesday, Alejado and Ashlock have said they plan to return.\n\nCal will host UCLA on Sept. 5, 2026.\n\nHawaii will also begin next season in the Bay Area when it visits Stanford on Aug. 29.",

    "fullText": "A California woman has been charged with murder after the remains of her missing 9-year-old daughter were found in Utah, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nAshlee Buzzard, 40, was arrested Tuesday after bullet cartridges found near her daughter's body were linked to a used cartridge case found in her home, said Santa Barbara County’s Sheriff-Coroner Bill Brown. Authorities found 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard’s body Dec. 6 in a rural area of Utah after a man and woman taking photos off of State Route 24 reported they had discovered remains.\n\nOfficers could not immediately identify her but concluded she died from gunshot wounds to the head, Brown said. The FBI's DNA analysis of the body found a familial DNA match to Buzzard.\n\nDetectives also found similar ammunition in a car Buzzard had rented, authorities said.\n\nBuzzard is being held without bail at the Northern Branch Jail in Santa Barbara, Brown said.\n\nOnline jail records did not list a court date or attorney who could speak on Buzzard’s behalf. The public defender’s office represented her in another case in November but did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA school administrator reported Melodee Buzzard's prolonged absence Oct. 14. Deputies went to the family's residence in Lompoc, but Buzzard would not say where her daughter was.\n\nBuzzard left California with her daughter on Oct. 7, driving a rented white 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office. They traveled as far as Nebraska with stops in Nevada, Arizona and Utah, and a return route included Kansas. Melodee Buzzard was last seen Oct. 9 on video surveillance near the Colorado-Utah line.\n\nDetectives learned the mother and daughter changed their appearance during travel. Video from the rental car office in Lompoc shows the child wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a wig that was darker and straighter than her natural hair, police said. The video shows her mother wearing a long, curly haired wig.\n\nBuzzard swapped wigs throughout the trip and changed the license plate of the rental car to avoid detection, police said. Buzzard returned home on Oct. 10 but her daughter was not with her, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nBrown said the crime was “calculated, cold-blooded” and premeditated, though a motive has not been determined.\n\n“Today, we stand together in grief, but also with resolve,” Brown said. “Melodee deserved a far better life than she had.”\n\nOfficials said the weapon has not been found, and the case remains under investigation.\n\nLilly Denes told the Los Angeles Times that her granddaughter was loveable, always smiling and well-behaved. Denes' son, the child's father, died when she was 6 months old. A detective told Denes on the phone Tuesday that authorities had “found the baby and the baby is with her dad,\" Denes said.\n\n“I knew he was telling me that the baby is dead,\" Denes said.",

    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance posted glossy photos of his personal training session with Navy SEALs—but the beachside stunt immediately drew mockery and accusations of political tone-deafness.\n\nThe 41-year-old former Marine, who served in Iraq before entering politics, had joined the Navy’s special-operations community for an early-morning workout at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California, a longtime hub for SEAL selection and training.\n\nFrom the official @VP account, Vance shared images on Monday of himself sprinting along the surf, hauling a log with helmeted operators whose faces were blurred, scrambling up a cargo net, and riding in a small boat punching through the waves.\n\n“Vice President Vance trains with @USNavy Seals at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado,” the caption read. On his personal account, Vance gushed that he had “just finished PT with the Navy SEALs for 90 minutes.”\n\nHe added, “They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train. So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world!”\n\nCritics were unimpressed. “Nice cosplay as a Navy SEAL,” one user wrote, adding: “Leadership isn’t about photo ops, it’s about fixing the mess at home.”\n\nOther critics photoshopped the infamous meme of Vance with a cartoonishly puffy face onto the soldiers he was working out with, using “GI Jello” as a punchline.\n\nAnother commenter sneered that it was a “desperate photo op for a Vice President who cares more about his military ‘aesthetic’ than actually governing.”\n\nDigital strategist Mike Nellis jabbed: “Cool, man—but when you’re done cosplaying, can you and your boss do something about housing and grocery prices? Thanks.”\n\nAnd Democratic strategist Christopher Hale wrote on X, “It’s the middle of the workday. While Americans are grinding to make Christmas work, the vice president is burning taxpayer dollars pretending to be a Navy SEAL.”\n\nVance’s made-for-camera workout follows a Trumpian trend of the president’s inner circle engaging in theatrics. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, 45, marked the D-Day anniversary and his birthday in June by leading a filmed PT session with troops on Omaha Beach before delivering a speech at the Normandy American Cemetery, a spectacle that also drew scrutiny as self-promotion.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has repeatedly been mocked as “ICE Barbie” for using federal law enforcement as props in a string of stylized photo ops, from tactical-gear raids to glossy fitness clips.\n\nThis is also not the first time Vance has tried to curry favor with the military. Ahead of Thanksgiving, he delivered a comedy skit to troops at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the vice president’s office for comment.",

    "fullText": "The future of high school football is here, and it’s burning bright. From California to Florida, Texas to Pennsylvania, gridiron stars have performed all across the country the past few months to electrify on Friday nights. We’re unveiling our Sophomore All-American list – the names you need to know now, because you’ll be hearing about them all throughout the off-season and into 2026. These athletes aren’t just talented; they’re the game-changers from this past 2025 high school football campaign.\n\nQB: Lukas Prock, Hun School\nWe’d be hard pressed to not have Prock heading up this list as the country’s top quarterback when you look at production, talent and competition he faced in 2025. The 6-foot-2, 180-pound quarterback went up against the likes of teams in Archbishop Spalding (Md.), The St. James Academy (Md.), St. Frances Academy (Md.), The First Academy and IMG Academy. The signal caller finished the season completing 226 of 309 passes for 4,330 yards and 41 touchdowns.\n\nRB: Xander Edwards, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nEdwards had himself a breakout season playing for the FHSAA Class 2A state semifinalist Bolles bulldogs. The sophomore running back averaged a ridiculous 9.9 yards per carry and rushed for 2,629 and scored 44 times on the ground. Add in his 17 catches for 211 yards and Edwards finishes just shy of 3,000 all-purpose yards for the 2025 season.\n\nRB: Zaiden Jernigan, Louisville (MS)\nJernigan made his name well known throughout the Magnolia State this past 2025 season as the running back put up some of the top numbers of any back in the country when it came to sophomores. The running back rushed for 1,563 yards on 238 carries and scored 20 touchdowns. The sophomore also added 205 yards and four touchdowns out of the backfield.\n\nWR: Roye Oliver, Hamilton (Ariz.)\nOliver was as good as advertised anytime he took the field for Hamilton, finishing the season catching 92 passes for 1,839 yards and scoring 29 touchdowns. There’s little doubt that Oliver is one of the country’s best wide receivers, regardless of class as he proved himself this 2025 campaign.\n\nWR: Brysen Wright, Mandarin (Fla.)\nThe four-star do-everything has done it all just about for Mandarin this past season, with Wright catching 46 passes for 983 yards and 10 touchdowns. Wright has also seen plenty of time on the defensive side of the ball as well, notching 63 tackles and intercepting five passes. The sophomore also contributed in the punt return game, totaling 254 yards on six returns.\n\nWR: Eric McFarland, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nThough McFarland reclassified to the Class of 2027, he was considered a sophomore throughout the entire 2025 high school football season. McFarland has shown his versatility not only going downfield, but also on jet sweeps, pop passes and even just taking hand-offs. Through nine games, McFarland caught 29 passes for 595 yards and scored 11 touchdowns.\n\nOT: R’Monie Edwards, Cypress Ranch (TX)\nAt 6-foot-5, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle was near impossible to get by for opposing defensive ends down in the Lone Star State. Rated a four-star by the Rivals Industry Rankings, Edwards led the way up front for over 4,500 all-purpose yards, 58 touchdowns and 463 points scored in 2025.\n\nOL: Elisha Mueller, Servite (Calif.)\nPlaying up against some of the top high school football programs in the land, Mueller held his own and then some for the Friars. Mueller is interchangeable at either guard position and led the way for Servite’s offense that totaled over 3,500 all-purpose yards and 39 touchdowns.\n\nC: Hunter Hill, Peach County (Ga.)\nHill can play center or at either guard position as he did during the 2025 season for the 10-2 Peach County Trojans. The 6-foot-3, 305-pound interior offensive lineman was superb in Year 2 and helped the Trojans amass 4,500-plus yards of offense and scoring 58 total touchdowns.\n\nOL: George Selvie III, Sumner (Fla.)\nFamiliar with the name? That’s because his father, George Selvie, starred at USF and eventually in the NFL. Now the younger Selvie plays for his father at Sumner and has blossomed into one of the top offensive linemen in the country when it comes to sophomores. Selvie III paved the way for over 3,800 yards and 45 touchdowns for the Class 7A region finalist Stingrays.\n\nOT: Jamarios Canton, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nProtecting the right side of Jayden Wade on Friday nights, Canton proved anytime out on the field that he was the top offensive tackle of the 2028 class. At 6-foot-4, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle took on all comers and right out of the gates against Hoover (Ala.) was pancaking opposing defensive linemen.\n\nAll-Purpose: Gaige Weddle, Rancho Bernardo (Calif.)\nI mean, what didn’t Weddle do for Rancho Bernardo in 2025? The dual-threat quarterback threw for 2,224 yards and 19 touchdowns through the air. Weddle led the team in rushing with 679 yards on just 98 attempts and 10 scores. Oh and Weddle also led the team on defense with 101 tackles, two sacks and two interceptions. Like we said, what didn’t Weddle do? He was what you want in a all-purpose athlete.\n\nEdge: Asher Ghioto, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nNo matter where Ghioto lined up on the defensive line, the 6-foot-5, 240-pound EDGE rusher was causing havoc for opposing offensive linemen. Ghioto finished the season totaling 84 tackles, 35 for a loss and 23 sacks.\n\nDT: Kellan Hall, Christian Academy of Louisville (KY)\nAnchoring the Centurions’ defensive line all throughout their undefeated 15-0 run to the KHSAA Class 3A state championship. Hall recently received defensive first-team all-state honors playing on the defensive line. When it comes to interior defensive linemen, there’s very few as agile and quick like the 6-foot-4, 255-pound stalwart.\n\nDT: Cory Cunningham, Providence (N.C.)\nThe four-star 6-foot-4, 265-pound defensive tackle was a force in North Carolina’s Class 8A throughout the season. Cunningham was unblockable for many opposing offensive linemen as the defensive tackle racked up 60 tackles, 28 going for a loss and 15 quarterback takedowns.\n\nEdge: Jackson Vaughn, Bergen Catholic (N.J.)\nJust because the numbers might’ve went down a little from his freshman campaign doesn’t mean that Vaughn didn’t remain a factor when it came to EDGE rushers. Teams took notice and Vaughn faced plenty of double and even triple teams. The edge rusher compiled 40 tackles, 12 for a loss and eight sacks.\n\nOLB: Judah Blair, Lakota West (OH)\nBlair at 6-foot-1, 200 pounds moves like a safety, but can hit you like a ton of bricks like a linebacker. The sophomore backer had a strong year in the linebacking corps for Lakota West, tallying 57 tackles, 15.5 going for a loss, three sacks and an interception.\n\nLB: Tahj Gray, St. Joseph Regional (N.J.)\nThe sophomore linebacker proved himself on the highest level of of New Jersey high school football, helping the St. Joseph Regional Green Knights win the NJSIAA Non-Public A state championship. Gray last season ended with 102 total tackles, 10.5 for a loss, four sacks and four passes broken up.\n\nLB: Nehemiah McCary, Maplesville (Ala.)\nMcCrary was a two-way force for Maplesville this past season as the Red Devils went on to win Alabama’s Class 1A state championship. The 6-foot-2, 225-pound linebacker’s performance in the state title game came on the offensive end of the ball where McCrary rushed for 182 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nCB: A’mir Sears, West Broward (Fla.)\nOne of the biggest reasons why West Broward made it all the way to Florida’s Class 6A state championship game was the play of the four-star athlete. Sears was dynamic on both sides of the ball, with the sophomore making 61 tackles, breaking up 11 passes and intercepting three others. On offense, Sears led the Bobcats with 942 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nCB: Langston Pridgeon, Stone Bridge (Va.)\nMany opposing quarterbacks thought twice before throwing to Pridgeon’s side of the field in 2025. Ranked as one of the top cornerbacks in the country, Pridgeon proved himself to being one of Virginia’s best players in the Bulldogs’ defensive secondary. Whether its playing in man or zone coverages, the sophomore excelled in his sophomore campaign.\n\nS: Casey Barner, McEachern (Ga.)\nHonestly, Barner could’ve been put at a multitude of spots on this list but his natural position is at safety and there was little doubt of his talents from the moment he stepped onto the field this season. In McEachern’s season-opening win 50-17 win over Walton, Barner compiled 341 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns.\n\nS: Giovanni Tuggle, Winder-Barrow (Ga.)\nIt’s an all-Georgia safety duo with Tuggle paired with Barner in the first team defensive backfield. Tuggle saw extensive playing time for the Bulldogs this past 2025 season as the four-star safety totaled 74 tackles, five pass breakups and also intercepted four others.\n\nPK: Jack Ciancio, Phenix City Central (Ala.)\nThe sophomore kicker was automatic when it came to extra points for the Phenix City Red Devils this past season, knocking down all 75 of his attempts. Ciancio connected on 11 field goals, with a long of 38 yards.\n\nP: Israel Carmona, Queen Creek (Ariz.)\nPlacing punts inside of an opponent’s 20-yard line was a specialty of Carmona’s this past season as the sophomore pinned teams deep into their own territory 17 times. On 39 punt attempts, Carmona averaged 40.6 yards with a long of 58 on the season.\n\nReturn Specialist: Tyree Mannings, Venice (Fla.)\nMannings was superb stepping into the No. 1 receiver role at Venice after Winston Watkins Jr. graduated and had built a strong connection with Howard quarterback commit Darryon Jones. The Indians’ top wide receiver hauled in 84 passes for 1,429 yards and 12 touchdowns. Mannings was deadly in the kick return game, compiling 335 return yards for the Indians.\n\nQB: Koa Malau’ulu, St. John Bosco (Calif.)\nRB: Taihj Moore, Deland (Fla.)\nRB: Kameron Battle, Carrollwood Day (Fla.)\nWR: Jaylen Addai, Shadow Creek (TX)\nWR: Jett Harrison, St. Joseph’s Prep (Pa.)\nWR: TJ Maddox, Winslow Township (N.J.)\nOT: Bryce Smalls, Archbishop Spalding (Md.)\nOL: Kris Scott, Taft (OH)\nC: Carl Noisette, Duluth (Ga.)\nOL: Maxx Jones, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nOT: Azhir Waddell, Dudley (N.C.)\nAll-Purpose: Deandre Bidden, Harper Woods (Mich.)\n\nEdge: Jalanie George, Desert Edge (Ariz.)\nDT: Kingston Brown, Carver (Ga.) \nDT: Jameer Whyce, Trotwood-Madison (OH)\nEdge: Darieon Prescott, Bolingbrook (IL)\nLB: Tysir Young, Middletown (DE)\nLB: Brayden Bonik, Ridge Point (TX)\nCB: Man Robinson, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nCB: Jermaine Cobbins, Springfield (Tenn.)\nS: Pole Moala, Leuzinger (Calif.)\nS: James Foster III, Lancaster (TX)\n\nPK: Luke Marchionni, Hamilton Southeastern (IN)\nP: Julian Trujillo, Eaglecrest (CO)\nReturn Specialist: Dillon Mitchell, C.E.

    "description": "For more than a month, the Bay Area has been subjected to a seemingly ceaseless stampede of earthquakes, rattling windows and raising fears across California.",
    "fullText": "For more than a month, the Bay Area has been subjected to a seemingly ceaseless stampede of earthquakes — the latest in a series of seismic swarms that have rattled windows and raised fears across California.\n\nThe latest swarm has been centered in the East Bay suburb of San Ramon, where a magnitude 4 earthquake struck Friday night — the largest since the cluster began — and a magnitude 3.9 on Saturday night. Since Nov. 9, there have been at least 80 earthquakes of magnitude 2 or greater in the area, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nWhile none of these quakes has been particularly potent — which was also the case in similar swarms recorded in Malibu, El Sereno and Ontario since 2024 — some fear the persistent seismic activity could foreshadow a back-of-mind concern for many Californians: the \"Big One.\"\n\nBut while experts acknowledge that some major earthquakes are preceded by more-modest temblors, they caution that the swarms by themselves probably don't offer a hint of when, or where, the next major quake will hit.\n\n\"There's gonna be a big earthquake in the Bay Area. We just can't say exactly when and where. So you should be prepared for that,\" said Annemarie Baltay, a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist.\n\nThe threat of a large earthquake always looms in California regardless of the appearance of small shakers. There is a 60% chance of an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater in the Los Angeles region by 2043, and a 72% chance of the same in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to 30-year estimates calculated by USGS in 2014.\n\nAcross California, there's also a 48% chance of a magnitude 7.5 quake or greater by 2043, and a 7% chance of a magnitude 8 or greater quake.\n\nIt is true that after every earthquake, there's a 1-in-20 chance it'll be followed by a larger magnitude temblor. But conventionally, only half of earthquakes have an easily detectable foreshock, while the other half do not.\n\nSouthern California has provided some recent examples of swarms that ultimately fizzled out. The Malibu area had a trio of scary earthquakes recently — a magnitude 4.6 earthquake on Feb. 9, 2024; a magnitude 4.7 on Sept. 12, 2024; and a magnitude 4.1 on March 9. But it has been quieter in the last six months.\n\nOntario endured a spate of shaking a little more than a year ago, topping out with a magnitude 4 quake on Oct. 6, 2024. But there have been fewer, much smaller quakes so far this year.\n\nAn earthquake swarm centered around El Sereno in Eastside Los Angeles also was detected last year, though that activity appears to have subsided following a magnitude 4.4 earthquake on Aug. 12, 2024.\n\nThe cluster of small San Ramon earthquakes in recent weeks is also not terribly unusual. The earthquakes are appearing on the northern end of the Calaveras fault as it runs into Mount Diablo.\n\nIncluding the current swarm and another last month, there have been nine earthquake swarms in the surrounding area since 1970. They have lasted anywhere from two to 42 days, with maximum magnitudes generally in the 3 to 4 range, according to Baltay.\n\n\"This is still really consistent with these kinds of swarms,\" Baltay said of the current activity.\n\nCertainly, for residents who feel the frequent small earthquakes, \"it's really unsettling ... you don't know when it's going to end,\" she said.\n\nNone of those earlier swarms resulted in a major quake on the northern section of the Calaveras fault, which hasn't ruptured catastrophically in modern history.\n\nStill, the Calaveras fault is one to watch for California. It's considered one of the most likely faults to rupture in a major quake for the Bay Area, and has the potential to trigger a magnitude 6.7 quake or greater. In 1984, a section of the Calaveras fault ruptured and caused the magnitude 6.2 Morgan Hill earthquake, which resulted in 21 minor injuries and $7.5 million in damage.\n\nAlso of concern are the Hayward fault and the notorious San Andreas fault, according to the USGS.\n\nThe smattering of small earthquakes in Southern California generated significant, not altogether unwarranted, attention last year.\n\nIn fact, 2024 ended up being a record of sorts for modest quakes in Southern California — there were 15 independent earthquake sequences that year with at least one magnitude 4 or higher earthquake, according to seismologist Lucy Jones. That was the highest total in 65 years, surpassing the 13 seen in 1988.\n\nBut last year's figure probably didn't mean much in the greater scheme of things. In 2025, there have been only five independent seismic sequences with at least one magnitude 4 or higher earthquake in Southern California.\n\nThat said, there have been situations when relatively modest quakes have preceded huge ones.\n\nIn 1857, a mammoth magnitude 7.8 earthquake ruptured along 225 miles of the San Andreas fault, stretching from Monterey County to Los Angeles County. That Big One hit at around 8:30 a.m. on Jan. 9, 1857, but it was preceded in Monterey County by a magnitude 5.6 earthquake an hour earlier, and a magnitude 6.1 earthquake an hour before that.\n\nAnd then there were the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes in the Mojave Desert. A magnitude 6.4 earthquake ruptured July 4 at 10:33 a.m., but that was followed by a much larger magnitude 7.1 earthquake at 8:19 p.m. the next day.\n\nThere were also a few harrowing months in 1992. A magnitude 6.1 Joshua Tree temblor on April 22 of that year made scientists nervous because its epicenter was only about 6 miles away from the San Andreas fault. After the Joshua Tree earthquake, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services issued an advisory for Southern California, warning people to be on alert for another, larger earthquake.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, \"nothing happened, but we kept on having all these aftershocks sitting there right near the San Andreas and making us uncomfortable and worrying about it,\" Jones said. The aftershocks eventually migrated north, away from the San Andreas.\n\nBut those aftershocks crept toward the eventual epicenter of a far more powerful earthquake in the Mojave Desert — the magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake of June 28, 1992. That quake resulted in aftershocks that also reactivated seismic activity around Joshua Tree.\n\n\"So we now had a continuous line of aftershocks coming all the way down to the San Andreas,\" Jones said.\n\nHours after the Landers earthquake, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck in Big Bear, \"which was on a different fault, but also the aftershocks to Big Bear extended down to the San Andreas in a different location,\" Jones said.\n\nThe result was so alarming to scientists and officials that the Governor's Office of Emergency Services issued what was then an unprecedented advisory urging people to stay off freeways, a call that came as freeway and bridge collapses from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake were still on the minds of many.\n\nNothing ended up happening on the San Andreas fault in 1992, however.\n\n\"It's probably the closest we've come to a prediction, ever,\" Jones said. \"We were really pretty nervous about it.\"\n\nHowever, there have been other major earthquakes with no easily noticeable foreshocks, Jones said. Those include some of the most destructive in recent memory, such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake and the 1971 Sylmar earthquake.\n\nA.

    "fullText": "Game developer, who was also involved in Medal of Honor and Titanfall, was killed in a car crash\n\nVince Zampella, the co-creator of the Call of Duty video game series, has died aged 55.\n\nThe head of the video game developer Respawn Entertainment and the co-founder of Infinity Ward was killed in a car crash in California, NBC Los Angeles reported.\n\nZampella led the creation of the bestselling video game series Call of Duty at Infinity Ward, and at his various studios he was involved in several highly successful game series from Medal of Honor to Titanfall.\n\nHe is reported to have died in a single-car accident on the Angeles Crest Highway, which was reported to the California highway patrol at 12.45pm on Sunday. The vehicle’s driver died at the scene, and a passenger died later in hospital.\n\nZampella began his career in video games in the mid-1990s. Most recently, he had been promoted to head of the Battlefield military shooter series of video games at EA Games – Battlefield 6 was released in October to critical acclaim.\n\nPreviously, in 2010, he founded Respawn Entertainment under EA, which created the Titanfall series of mech shooters and the popular multiplayer game Apex Legends.\n\nZampella is best known for his time in the 2000s at Infinity Ward, a studio he co-founded with Grant Collier and Jason West in 2002. There, he co-created the Call of Duty video game series and some of its most acclaimed entries, including Modern Warfare (2007) and Modern Warfare 2 (2009).\n\nThe Call of Duty games have gone on to sell more than 500m copies. In 2010, he was involved with other former Infinity Ward staff in a lawsuit against the series’ publisher, Activision, over unpaid royalties.\n\nIn a statement on Monday night, EA said: “This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work.\n\n“Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.”",

    "description": "Our Cal vs. Hawaii predictions back the Golden Bears to cover this short spread.",
    "fullText": "The Cal Golden Bears have already gotten a big win this bowl season, as star quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele has committed to the program for next season.\n\nNow, they’ll go for a second big win by winning an actual bowl game. Sagapolutele and the Golden Bears head out to the Pacific for the Hawaii Bowl to face off against the hometown Rainbow Warriors.\n\nThe Rainbow Warriors are slight home favorites, but my Cal vs. Hawaii predictions explain why JKS and the Golden Bears are a gift to add to college football picks in this Christmas Eve matchup.\n\nThis will be a close game, but Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele will be the best player on the field, and in the end, he'll be the difference in this game, leading Cal to a win in the Hawaii Bowl.\n\nIt was a season full of highs and lows for the Cal Golden Bears. Cal finished the season with seven wins, but it also had some bad losses that cost head coach Justin Wilcox his job.\n\nHowever, one thing is for certain. The Bears have something in Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele, and new HC Tosh Lupoi did enough to convince him to stay in Berkley. JKS can focus on his homecoming in the Hawaii Bowl.\n\nJKS, from Ewa Beach, Hawaii, finished the regular season throwing for 3,117 yards with 17 touchdowns to nine interceptions. He battled his consistency this season, but when he was on, he was really on.\n\nJust look at his regular-season finale against SMU. JKS torched the Mustangs for 330 yards with four touchdowns and no picks. In fact, he’s been on fire over the last three games, with 922 passing yards and no picks.\n\nMeanwhile, Hawaii enters this bowl with an 8-4 record, earning its first bowl berth under Timmy Chang.\n\nHawaii’s strength this season was its defense, and it has solid numbers against the pass. However, the Rainbow Warriors haven’t exactly faced too many good passing teams this season in the Mountain West. The one time they did, UNLV beat them 38-10.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, the Rainbow Warriors are always going to be a pass-first team, but that is the strength of his Cal defense, which ranks 43rd in success rate on dropbacks.\n\nIn front of family and friends, JKS starts the new era of Cal football off with a win in the Hawaii Bowl, covering the short spread in the process.\n\nI like the JKS and the Golden Bears to get off to a good start in the Hawaii Bowl. But this game could be a back-and-forth battle for 60 minutes. I already like JKS and Cal to put up some numbers in this one, but he won’t be the only one.\n\nHawaii QB Micah Alejado threw for 2,832 yards with 21 touchdowns compared to nine interceptions over his 10 games played this season, helping Hawaii put up 31 or more points in six of their last eight games.\n\nSpread: California -1.5 | Hawaii +1.5\n\nMoneyline: California -110 | Hawaii -110\n\nOver/Under: Over 52.5 | Under 52.5\n\nCal has hit the first-half moneyline in four of its last six games for +7.65 Units and a 91% ROI.

    "fullText": "Barcelona continued their scintillating La Liga form with a 2-0 victory over Villarreal in their final match of 2025. Goals from Raphinha and Lamine Yamal made it eight league wins in a row for the Catalans, who end the year with a four-point lead in the standings.\n\nThe match saw Frenkie de Jong make his return to the starting line-up after a number of weeks on the bench, and he was one of the standouts for Barcelona. As per Sport, he gave his reaction the victory in the mixed zone.\n\n“I’m very happy. We closed the year as leaders, which was the objective. Villarreal come out quickly on the counter and have dangerous players. I felt that we were superior. It was a well-deserved victory. We’re fine. Now is not the time for titles, but we are alive in everything.”\n\nJoan Garcia produced another impressive showing on his way to a clean sheet, and the Barcelona goalkeeper also spoke on the match to the club’s official media channels (via MD).\n\n“We knew it was very important to get the three points in the last game of the year. We have achieved it and we finished top in this first half of the season. There is still a long way to go but we had this objective and we have achieved it.\n\n“When a team is down one player, it always makes things easier for you. We would have liked to kill the game earlier and score the second before and then make a third, but they played very well and knew how to defend with ten men. The important thing is that we got the three points and kept a clean sheet.\n\n“I try to stop the ones that come to me. There are days when I can do it and others I can’t. Today, luckily, we got a clean sheet and I’m very happy.”\n\nGerard Martin also spoke to the media after the match at La Ceramica, and as per MD, he expressed pride over Barcelona’s growth in recent months.\n\n“We have grown a lot since the beginning of the season. We have improved in many things and it is showing in recent games. Villarreal are a difficult team and a difficult ground. We knew they hadn’t lost and it was important to win because we were at the top of the standings. It seems like an easy game, but it was complicated.”",

PB: 20.\n\nSad about not winning the billion-dollar Powerball jackpot? Don't throw away your tickets just yet.\n\nMore than 400 Powerball tickets worth more than $400 were sold across California over the weekend, with the highest \"consolation prize\" ticket going for more than $2.3 million.\n\nAccording to California Lottery's website on Saturday night, a ticket worth $2,323,527 was sold at Wright's Market on Ventura Boulevard in Oxnard.\n\nThis comes as a drawing was held for the then-jackpot of $1.5 billion. Below were the winning numbers for the Dec. 20 drawing – which apparently no one got all six numbers:\n\nThe drawing for the new jackpot of $1.6 billion will be held on Monday, December 22 at 8 p.m. PT.\n\nThere are 400 millions of reasons to dream, especially what you would do with the jackpot money. However, one thing all lottery winners have to take into account is the fact that their prizes will be taxed.\n\nSo how much do you really get after taxes?\n\nIt depends on a couple of factors: do you have to pay state taxes where you live? Will you take the lump sum payment or the annuity payout?\n\nAccording to Mega Millions' website, those electing to take the annuity option get one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments. Powerball follows an identical process for paying out its jackpot winners.\n\nThis story was reported from Los Angeles.\n\nThis report used information provided by the California Lottery website and mentioned previous FOX 11 reports.",

    "fullText": "400-Mile-Long Fog Blankets California For Weeks\n\nPretty much everyone feels like they see endless gray skies in winter, but California’s Central Valley is taking things a step further with three weeks of foggy conditions from a phenomenon called \"tule fog.\"\n\nSatellite imagery from NASA and CIRA has revealed how pervasive the fog has been for the region, with day-after-day and week-after-week fogginess never letting up.\n\nThe fog started to develop on Nov. 22 and was firmly in place by Nov. 24 — and it's pretty much been there ever since (though it has grown and shrunk a little on a day-to-day basis).\n\nSoil in the Central Valley has been nice and moist following a rainy autumn.\n\nIn fact, precipitation totals from September through November ranked among the top 10% wettest on record for most of central and southern California. Modesto and Hanford, California, each broke the record for the wettest meteorological fall since records began.\n\nSo we have moist air for the equation.\n\nIn late November, a stable high-pressure system developed over California, helping to trap all of that moisture.\n\nThe fog layer has kept things cool in the valley as the rest of the Southwest has been basking in above-average temperatures.\n\nNow we have our temperature inversion.\n\nIs the end coming soon? Until a storm comes in to clear out the moist air, there's no anticipated end to the foggy conditions. The National Weather Service in Hanford, California, is warning of fog at least through Friday of this week.\n\nSara Tonks is a content meteorologist with weather.com and has a bachelor’s and a master’s degree from Georgia Tech in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences along with a master’s degree from Unity Environmental University in Marine Science.",

    "description": "Posters that appeared at Tesla's California factories and a review of LinkedIn profiles show how the automaker is scaling its ride-hailing service.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on its \"Robotaxi\" service — and putting factory workers and sales staff in drivers' seats to make it happen.\n\nThe electric-car maker has started recruiting workers off factory lines to operate its ride-hailing fleet. Tesla is offering production associates and material handlers extra hours and pay to take on the role of AI operator, according to posters that appeared at its California factories earlier this month.\n\nThe AI operators sit in the driver's seat, actively monitoring the vehicle while Tesla's Full Self-Driving software is engaged, and taking over when needed. Tesla plans to eventually release the software as a fully autonomous service.\n\nThe extra sets of hands will help the company expand ride-hailing availability in the Bay Area, the posters said.\n\nThe posters, which also appeared in several engineering facilities, noted that staffers could earn $500 if they refer a friend for the AI operator role.\n\nSome sales staffers in Nevada and Arizona moved over to similar operator roles in Las Vegas and Phoenix last month, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles.\n\nAdding more operators could help Tesla speed up service. After Tesla rolled out its Robotaxi app to the public in September, wait times spiked, with some passengers reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes and a lack of available vehicles.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said he's recently seen wait times around 10 minutes in the Bay Area, and during peak commuting times, the app at times says it cannot provide a ride due to \"high service demand.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla completed the self-certification process for service in Nevada and Arizona last month. It has yet to apply for a license with the Nevada Transportation Authority to launch a commercial service, but it has a permit from the Arizona Department of Transportation that allows it to operate commercially in the state, spokespeople from the agencies told Business Insider.\n\nThe company has yet to begin offering paid rides in either state.\n\nMeanwhile, the company launched its Bay Area ride-hailing service in August. It's not registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California; it operates its service with a driver because the state has stricter regulations around autonomous vehicles than most other states, many of which operate around an honor system where the company self-certifies its vehicles.\n\nTesla has a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission that allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public as a regular car service with a driver. The agency has said Tesla is not authorized to transport members of the public in an autonomous vehicle.\n\nTesla currently has 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers registered for its ride-hailing service in California, according to a spokesperson for the CPUC. Tesla is required to update the agency incrementally as it adds new vehicles to the fleet, but not drivers, the spokesperson said. (The registration number reflects vehicles approved for use; it doesn't necessarily indicate how many are operating at any given time.)\n\nLast December, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles for a permit with the California Department of Motor Vehicles that would allow it to test its autonomous software with a test driver.\n\nA spokesperson for the DMV said Tesla has yet to apply for a driverless testing permit, which would be required before the company can offer AV rides to the public.\n\nThe company also operates a ride-hailing service in Austin, where it launched with a safety operator in the passenger seat.\n\nMusk said during an xAI event earlier this month that Tesla's Austin service will be driverless by the end of the year.\n\n\"I think it's pretty much a solved problem, we're going through validation right now,\" he said, according to a recording posted on social media.\n\nA spokesperson for the Austin Transportation Department told Business Insider that the company has yet to inform the city of the date it plans to roll out the driverless feature to its commercial service. Tesla is not legally required to inform the city, but it has typically alerted it to changes to its service, the spokesperson said.\n\nTesla is hiring for AI operators across the US, including in Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado, and Texas, according to its website. The role has around-the-clock shifts and requires workers to sit behind the wheel while FSD is engaged, interact with passengers, and collect detailed reports on vehicle performance. It can also involve testing in various cities across the country. The salary ranges from around $25 to $30 per hour.\n\nThe recruiting process involved an FSD test drive, a valid driver's license, and passing a drug test and background check, according to people who interviewed for the role.\n\nMusk said in October that the company plans to expand its service to eight to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. The company is testing its service in several cities across the country.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at gkay@businessinsider.com or Signal at 248-894-6012.

The company has registered 798 drivers, the spokesperson said.\n\nThat's up from 28 cars and 128 drivers in August, when the service launched, according to the CPUC.\n\nThe vehicle number reflects car that have been approved for use, not the actual operational fleet number. The spokesperson also said the carmaker isn't required to update the state as it adds new drivers, which means the current number could be higher.\n\nThe Alphabet-backed autonomous vehicle company began offering driverless rides for select members of the public in 2023.\n\nThe agency said Zoox has 229 registered vehicles. Zoox, which launched in San Francisco in November, told Business Insider that it has 50 vehicles active in its fleet between San Francisco and Las Vegas. Zoox and Waymo run fully autonomously.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast year, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles with the California Department of Motor Vehicles for a permit to test its self-driving software with a test driver.\n\nTesla's \"Robotaxi\" isn't registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California, which maintains some of the strictest AV regulations in the country. The company has not applied for a driverless testing permit, a DMV representative told Business Insider.\n\nThe company's permit from the CPUC allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public. A separate permit is required to transport passengers using an autonomous vehicle.\n\nSome users have complained on social media of long wait times since the company launched the Robotaxi app to the public in September. Tesla initially started operating the service with a small group of early access users; as access expanded, wait times have increased, with some users reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said that at times recently he's been unable to secure a ride due to a lack of inventory during peak commuting hours. On off hours, he's seen wait times around ten minutes, he said.\n\nTesla is ramping up driver staffing. The company has circulated flyers in its California factories offering hourly employees extra pay to help operate its network.\n\nIn Austin, where Elon Musk has said Tesla recently began testing its vehicles without drivers or safety operators, it's unclear how many cars the company has running in the service. Tesla is not required to submit these numbers to Austin, a spokesperson for the transportation department said.\n\nMusk said during an appearance in the \"All In\" podcast in October that Tesla planned to have around 500 vehicles running in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A Northern California man caught a plump canary rockfish he says weighed in at 10.25 pounds (4.65 kilograms), likely setting state and world records.\n\nMendocino County fisherman Brendan Walsh, 26, said he caught the fish Tuesday off the coast of Albion, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of San Francisco.\n\nWalsh was headed back with his father Will Walsh after catching a few yellowtail on a cold and rainy day when he decided to make one last stop at a deeper spot. That's where the younger Walsh landed the canary rockfish.\n\n“It was a fluke,” he said. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”\n\nCanary rockfish can grow up to 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) in length and weigh 10 lbs. (4.5 kilograms), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Walsh says the ones he usually catches are small and scrawny, clocking in around 3 lbs. (1.4 kilograms).\n\nWalsh said the fish he caught this week was 2.25 feet (0.68 meters) long.\n\nHe submitted the catch to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which tracks angling and diving records. The current state record-holding fish weighed in at 9 lbs. and was caught last November, also in Mendocino County.\n\nThe department has a form and instructions for submitting a possible record catch, including the names and phone numbers of witnesses. Applicants are asked to contact the department for the nearest environmental scientist who can identify the catch.\n\nWalsh said they weighed the fish at an authorized fish market nearby and a state fish and wildlife scientist who works in the area came over to sign off on the paperwork.\n\nWalsh has also submitted his catch to the International Game Fish Association in Florida, where the world record holding 10-pound canary rockfish was caught in 1986. He says larger fish may have been caught but never submitted for record consideration.\n\nThe game fish association did not respond Friday to a request for comment.\n\nAfter spending Tuesday making sure they had taken the right measurements to document the catch, Walsh's mother, Deirdre Lamb, fried the rockfish with garlic and butter to eat on Wednesday.\n\nThe rockfish was delicious, he said.",

    "fullText": "He told his physician he couldn’t stand or sit without “significant pain,” authorities say.\n\nHousehold chores were anything but routine.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Officer Jordan Roy Lester claimed a medical retirement was the only recourse because of a debilitating injury, according to authorities. Then the department’s internal affairs investigators observed Lester on property he'd newly purchased cutting down trees, stacking firewood and operating heavy machinery.\n\nFast-forward two years and the 17-year veteran pleaded guilty in Sacramento County court on Wednesday to felony insurance fraud and was sentenced to 270 days in a county jail.\n\nLester, 45, is also on two years' formal probation and has been ordered to pay $232,829 in restitution to the CHP and $127,791 to the state compensation insurance fund.\n\nHe’ll also lose his service and pension credit for the years in which fraud was committed.\n\n“We take workers’ compensation fraud very seriously as it has an immediate and lasting financial impact on employers and delays medical care and financial assistance to employees legitimately injured at work,” Sacramento County Dist. Atty. Thien Ho said in a statement.\n\nHo added: “To have a peace officer commit this fraud is not only a violation of their duty to serve and protect with integrity, but it is also a violation of public trust.”\n\nLester was arrested in Quincy, in the Plumas National Forest of Northern California, in August 2024 after a multiyear investigation by the CHP's Workers’ Compensation Fraud Investigation Unit. Lester filed a workers' compensation claim in July 2021, though his superiors said the injury was “not significant,” according to the Sacramento County District Attorney's office. He was not taken off duty.\n\nLester had been assigned to the CHP's Central Division but briefly was moved to Quincy, according to the CHP office there. The home he purchased was located in Quincy.\n\nOn his days off he worked the property, according to the D.A.’s office, and eventually reached out to a former officer about obtaining medical retirement, according to authorities.\n\nIf he'd succeeded in getting medical retirement, he would have received 85% of his salary for life, tax-free, the D.A.’s office said.\n\nAs a CHP officer, Lester earned more than $260,000 in pay and benefits in 2021, according to the public pay database Transparent California.\n\nIn January 2022, Lester visited a doctor to have his claim substantiated, authorities said. He immediately was taken off his normal shift. His fortunes unraveled not long after when investigators witnessed him on his property engaging in “heavy physical activity,” according to the D.A.’s office.\n\nAn independent medical examiner tested Lester in February 2024 and said that not only could Lester “perform all work duties,” but the CHP veteran also “exaggerated his complaints,” according to the D.A.’s office.\n\nHe was arrested six months later.\n\nA.

    "description": "Joe Tiller took his Boilermakers on a trip to Pasadena, California, several years before they eventually made the Rose Bowl. More on that foundational moment:",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: This story is the third in a series related to Purdue's 2000 football season.\n\nIt's Sept. 13, 2025, a date several members of Purdue football's 2000 Big Ten championship team had eagerly awaited for weeks.\n\nThe Boilermakers are hosting USC and, for a bunch of guys who last suited up for the Boilermakers more than two decades earlier, this is a full circle moment.\n\nThe two programs hadn't played since the 1998 season opener in Los Angeles.\n\nPurdue lost that game 27 years ago, but what many who were there remember is the day after. Coach Joe Tiller had a planned field trip the players weren't looped in about.\n\n\"This was way out of the norm for coach Tiller. He was football, strictly business,\" safety Ben Smith said. \"For him to, one, not make us fly back after the game and, two, take us to the Rose Bowl, we had no idea where we were going.\n\n\"We show up there and there’s the neon lights. He gave us the old coach fire up talk and said, 'Guys, I want you to go out there and feel the grass, look in the stands. I want you to go in the press box and walk around this place and envision before you’re done playing here, playing in the Rose Bowl.'\"\n\nTwo years later, Tiller's Boilermakers finished in a three-way tie for the Big Ten title and were the league's representative to play Washington in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1, 2001.\n\nSurvey Purdue's roster during that time period and you'll get various answers on the program-shifting moment that resulted in that Rose Bowl trip. For some, it's that game at USC. Others say Purdue's upset of No. 4 Kansas State in the 1998 Alamo Bowl.\n\nTiller's second game as Boilermaker coach on Sept. 13, 1997. The roster was a blend of Jim Colletto recruits, who'd been a part of a 3-8 team the season before, and the Big Ten's lowest-rated recruiting class.\n\n\"I was in coach Tiller’s first class. So prior to us getting there, they were nothing,\" safety Tim Upshur said. \"And I'll never forget our first game we played my freshman year was Toledo.\n\nPart 1: How coach Joe Tiller laid foundation for Purdue football's 2000 Rose Bowl team\n\nPart 2: Joe Tiller's coaching staff was 'equally as good' as Purdue football Rose Bowl team\n\nTo outsiders, it was same old Purdue. Tiller's postgame message was a sign these Boilermakers were anything but.\n\n\"We've got some work to do,\" he told the team.\n\nTiller also said the team Purdue would beat Notre Dame the following game. Whether he believed it or not is irrelevant. The players believed that Tiller believed. And then they believed.\n\nPurdue beat Notre Dame for the first time since 1985 in Tiller's second game as head coach on Sept. 13, 1997, seven days after losing his first to Toledo.\n\n\"It goes back to that cultural shift,\" offensive lineman Chukky Okobi said. \"You go back to '96 and we can’t beat anybody and all the sudden we beat Notre Dame in '97. What else can we do? That kind of became the mindset going forward. If we can beat this team, there’s no reason we can’t beat every team.\"\n\nWest Lafayette was abuzz over its football program for the first time in years.\n\n\"The first game I ever dressed for was '97 against Notre Dame and that was the infamous (game). We win and they throw the goal post in the Wabash (River),\" punter Scott Kurz said. \"We enjoyed the energy our fans brought. It caught a lot of teams off guard and it was a real special memory for all of us.\"\n\nNotre Dame was the first of six consecutive wins in what became a 9-3 season, capped by beating Oklahoma State in the Alamo Bowl.\n\nBetween 1997-99, Purdue, which hadn't posted a winning record since 1984 previously, went a combined 25-12.\n\n\"That's where the great deal of pride I have in this institution today is because I felt like I was a part of turning the tide and changing the narrative of what Purdue football is, what it was and would it could be,\" said former cornerback Lamar Conard, who was Purdue's running backs coach until a few weeks ago, and whose last season playing was 1999.\n\nAll that did was up the ante for that 2000 season, when Tiller's first Purdue recruits would be seniors.\n\n\"I remember our recruiting class coming in 1997, we were the last-place ranked recruiting class (in the Big Ten) coming in,\" quarterback Drew Brees said in an interview with Journal & Courier in 2015. \"But we made a commitment to one another that by the time we left Purdue, we were going to be Big Ten champs and we were going to the Rose Bowl. That’s exactly what we had the chance to do.\"\n\nNathan Baird and Sam King have the best Purdue sports coverage, and \n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Purdue football trip to Rose Bowl helped them envision Rose Bowl berth",

    "title": "CA judge rules Tesla lied about FSD, must fix marketing within 60 days",
    "description": "Tesla engaged in false advertising for its Full Self-Driving system. Unless it fixes the issues, its license to sell in CA will be suspended.",
    "fullText": "A California judge ruled late Tuesday afternoon that Tesla engaged in “deceptive marketing” in reference to its Full Self-Driving system, and that Tesla’s license to sell and produce cars in the state should be revoked for 30 days.\n\nHowever, the California DMV has said it will give Tesla 60 days to comply and fix its marketing before going through with the suspension.\n\nThe ruling is big news in a case that has been ongoing for years now.\n\nTesla has been selling level 2 driver assist software since 2016 which it calls “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), despite that this software did not (and still does not) make its cars capable of driving themselves.\n\nThis name has attracted much consternation over the years, becoming more absurd as each of Tesla’s predicted deadlines for the advent of full autonomy blow by.\n\nTesla also provides software under the name “Autopilot,” another term that evokes some level of autonomy, though perhaps not as explicitly as the aforementioned FSD. Tesla long held the position that this word is meant to evoke airplane-like systems that still require a pilot, but can just do most of the work for them.\n\nSo eventually, in 2021, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) officially started an investigation into Tesla’s marketing claims, to determine whether the company had lied to consumers.\n\nCalifornia found that the company was saying different things to the public than it was saying to the DMV.\n\nThe DMV then sent an official inquiry to Tesla in 2022, asking for it to respond to the claim that it was creating incorrect perceptions about the capabilities of its system. Tesla’s response stated that it had been allowed to lie about FSD for so long that it should get to keep going, which was apparently not persuasive enough to the courts, and the case was then slated for trial.\n\nDuring this time, the California legislature got involved as well, passing a law that specifically banned automakers from deceiving consumers into thinking vehicles have more autonomous capabilities than they do.\n\nWell, after all these investigations and waiting, we finally have an an answer, and the judge’s ruling makes it quite clear: Tesla lied to consumers about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nThe court looked at Tesla’s marketing claims and also at surveys of people exposed to those claims and their opinion of whether a Tesla would be able to drive itself, given the marketing messages put out by the company.\n\nIt found problems both with the word Autopilot and the phrase Full Self-Driving.\n\nThe word “Autopilot” was not found to be “unambiguously false,” but the court said that its use “follows a long but unlawful tradition of ‘intentionally (using) ambiguity to mislead consumers while maintaining some level of deniability about the intended meaning.'” The court found that a reasonable person could believe that a car on Autopilot doesn’t require their constant undivided attention, which is incorrect as the driver is still fully responsible for the vehicle.\n\nOn “Full Self-Driving,” the court was even more harsh. It found that this feature name is “actually, unambiguously false and counterfactual” (comically, Tesla tried to argue here that “no reasonable person” could believe that Full Self-Driving actually means Full Self-Driving).\n\nThe court noted other language used by Tesla, including marketing copy that said “the system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat,” and suggested that “legal reasons” are the only things holding Tesla back from full autonomy. Tesla tried to say that this was a statement of future intent, but the court found that its use of the present tense shows otherwise.\n\nTesla has repeatedly changed its wording around FSD, first calling it Full Self-Driving Capability, then changing that to Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to emphasize the need for a driver to supervise the vehicle. The court noted these changes, and then said it would not be a burden to force Tesla to change its marketing further to clarify that its cars do not drive themselves.\n\nWhich leads us to the proposed legal remedy: the court said that the DMV could suspend or revoke Tesla’s licenses for 30 days, stopping its ability to sell or build cars in the state.\n\nTesla’s first factory is in Fremont, California, where it still builds around half a million vehicles a year and employs some ~20,000 employees. Tesla says this remedy would be “draconian,” but the court said that without this option, there’s no reason to believe Tesla would stop its misrepresentations to the public.\n\nThe court also examined the possibility of financial restitution, but deemed that inappropriate. Since the case did not establish any quantifiable financial harm done by Tesla’s misrepresentation and noted the impracticality of accounting for that harm.\n\nThis ruling does not yet mean that Tesla can’t sell cars in California, which is its largest market in the US by far. The court noted that the DMV has the option of suspension or revocation, which the DMV can do at its discretion. And the DMV has said that it will allow Tesla 60 days to comply with the order before it takes action, and that it would focus on Tesla’s dealer license rather than its manufacturing license.\n\nThis would mean, specifically, that Tesla not refer to a level 2 driving system as “Autopilot” or using language that suggests these vehicles are autonomous. It will have to change its marketing materials and stop making public statements misleading the public about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nTesla said after the ruling that “sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” But we’ll see what happens in 60 days, and what sort of changes Tesla does or does not make to its deceptive marketing.\n\nTuesday’s ruling is just one of many legal cases against Tesla right now, specifically having to do with FSD. One relevant case is a class action lawsuit in California claiming Tesla misled customers about its cars self-driving capabilities. This ruling could provide fuel for that lawsuit, given a California judge has already gone on the record with an official determination that Tesla misled the public about FSD.\n\nThe 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year.

    "fullText": "California-based electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxi developer Archer Aviation is putting down roots on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company revealed its plans to build an engineering hub in South West England that will be operated by a new subsidiary, Archer Aviation UK Limited. The move adds to its primary manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia, which could also be complemented by production capabilities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\n\"The U.K. has the talent and industrial base to be a major player in driving the next era of advanced aerospace and defence,\" said Adam Goldstein, Archer's founder and CEO. \"Archer's plans to open a U.K. engineering hub underscores our commitment to being an integral part of the next-generation of aerospace and defence in the country.\"\n\nArcher also poached engineer Limhi Somerville from what would be its largest U.K. competitor-Vertical Aerospace, which last week unveiled its flagship eVTOL, Valo.\n\nLike Archer's Midnight, Valo is designed to carry up to four passengers on zero-emission flights in urban settings, producing a fraction of the noise of a helicopter. Somerville spent six years with Vertical and led its development of electric batteries and powertrains, most recently serving as director of engineering. He will join Archer's team in early 2026, the company said.\n\nAcquiring team members from competitors is a blueprint the company has deployed before. Earlier this year, for example, George Kivork, the former head of U.S. state and local policy for rival Joby Aviation, joined Archer as a general manager for the Los Angeles region.\n\nHowever, the strategy has gotten the company in some hot water. Joby in November sued both Archer and Kivork, alleging that its competitor used trade secrets from Kivork to undercut an exclusive deal it had planned to finalize. Archer has rejected the allegations.\n\nWisk Aero, the eVTOL arm of Boeing, sued Archer in 2021, also alleging that a former employee stole trade secrets. Archer promptly countersued. The companies ultimately settled for an undisclosed amount, and Boeing made an investment intended to fund the integration of Wisk's autonomy technology on future variants of Midnight.\n\nMidnight is a piloted, four-passenger eVTOL model with a cruise speed of about 150 mph, designed for 10-20-minute, 20-50 sm trips. Its six electric battery packs each power a pair of motors and propellers, half of which are capable of tilting to support both hover and forward flight.\n\nIn the U.S., Archer is working with United Airlines-which placed an order for up to 200 aircraft-and Southwest Airlines to build air taxi networks in major urban centers. It has shared potential route maps for New York, Miami, and Los Angeles, where it recently acquired Hawthorne Municipal Airport (KHHR) for $126 million.",

    "fullText": "To prevent the spread of a serious bacterial disease that infects citrus crops, United States officials are expanding two federal quarantine areas.\n\nAs reported by the Fresh Fruit Portal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has expanded the citrus greening quarantines for two separate counties in Southern California.\n\nAPHIS is expanding the quarantined area in the Capistrano Beach area of Orange County by 29 square miles and the Murrieta area of Riverside County by 129 square miles. The announcement of the expansion follows the positive detection of citrus greening in plant tissue samples collected from locations in both Orange and Riverside Counties.\n\nAccording to APHIS, there are currently no commercial citrus trees impacted by the expansion of the quarantined area in Orange County. However, 170 acres of commercial citrus trees have now been impacted by the citrus greening quarantine in Riverside County.\n\nThe quarantine expansions are coordinated with the California Department of Food and Agriculture. They aim to contain citrus greening by restricting the movement of citrus materials within the state, aligning with 7 CFR 301.76.\n\n\"This action is necessary to prevent the spread of citrus greening to non-infested areas of the United States,\" APHIS wrote in the release.\n\nThe bacterial disease is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid, an invasive insect species that was first documented in the U.S. in 1998. These invasive pests can wreak havoc on local ecosystems and economies by disrupting agricultural industries and interfering with native species.\n\nCitrus greening, in particular, can be devastating for citrus crops. It can lead to reduced yields, poor-quality fruit, and higher production costs. The bacteria can block nutrient flow in plants, stunting growth and killing roots. As noted by APHIS, there is currently no known cure for the disease.\n\nThis isn't the first time in 2025 that California has turned to drastic measures to deal with invasive insects. In September, portions of Santa Clara County were placed under quarantine by the California Department of Food and Agriculture after officials detected the invasive Mediterranean fruit fly.\n\n\"A quarantine is a way to minimize damage and stop the risk of spread by restricting the movement of fruits and vegetables,\" wrote the CDFA in a press release.\n\nDo you think fracking should be illegal in America?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The judge ruled Tesla should have to suspend manufacturing and sales in California for 30 days, but the DMV stayed those rulings for 90 days to allow Tesla to comply.",
    "fullText": "An administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\n\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.”\n\n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\n\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\n\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\n\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\n\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.",

    "description": "California's DMV ordered Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" within 90 days, or face a month-long dealership suspension.",
    "fullText": "Tesla may have to rebrand Autopilot.\n\nSteve Gordon, the Director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a media briefing on Tuesday that Tesla has 90 days to amend its advertising language or face a 30-day suspension from selling in California.\n\nGordon said on Tuesday that the DMV is specifically asking Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" to clarify that the company has advanced driving systems, which do not equate to an automated system or an autonomous vehicle. Changes must be made within 90 days, or the DMV will \"enforce the cessation of sales.\"\n\n\"My guess is that they will pursue some remedy,\" said Gordon of what Tesla might do next, \"but the easiest one for them is just to come into compliance.\"\n\nIn response to the DMV's decision, a Tesla spokesperson told Business Insider that this is \"a 'consumer protection' order about the use of the term 'Autopilot' in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nOn November 21, Administrative Judge Juliet E. Cox made a proposed decision about whether Tesla has misled consumers into thinking its cars are more capable of driving themselves than they actually are, and transmitted it to the DMV for consideration. The document containing the proposal, however, has been withheld from the public and won't be released till December 22.\n\nGordon said during the Tuesday briefing that Cox recommended both a suspension of Tesla's license to sell and to manufacture in California. The DMV, however, decided not to pursue a suspension of the license to manufacture and put a temporary 90-day stay on the suspension of the license to sell for Tesla to make amends.\n\n\"They're very important to the state,\" said Gordon of Tesla. \"We want to be fair to them and give them a chance to see if they can find a resolution now that there is a ruling from the administrative law judge.\"\n\n\"If you look at the Q3 report of this year, Tesla has the top-selling car, the Model Y, in its segment,\" Gordon added. \"We felt that the leverage via the sales channel was sufficient to get compliance.\"\n\nThe notice to Tesla follows a weeklong hearing in July at the administrative court in Oakland. In 2022, the DMV sued Tesla, accusing the carmaker of misleading consumers through Tesla's advertisements and by naming its driver assistance technologies \"Full Self-Driving\" and \"Autopilot.\"\n\nTesla, which had a rocky year, denied that the company had ever tried to conceal the fact that its vehicles cannot fully drive themselves.\n\nThe DMV sought to suspend Tesla's ability to sell cars in the state for at least 30 days and award consumers monetary damages.\n\nThe CA DMV wrote in its complaint that on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, Tesla's website advertised its FSD driver assistance system as being \"designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver's seat.\"\n\nTesla's lawyers said during the hearing that the company has always informed buyers that they \"cannot fully rely\" on FSD or Autopilot.\n\n\"Cars with Full Self-Driving capabilities are currently not capable of driving themselves,\" said Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, during the hearing.",

    "fullText": "Fallout returns with a new journey into the Mojave Wasteland.\n\n on December 16, 2025 at 6:00PM PST\n\nSPOILERS for Fallout Season 2 Episode 1: The Man Who Knew to follow:\n\nThe last time we saw Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), The Ghoul aka Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins), and beloved pup CX404, their situation looked dire.\n\nLucy had learned her father Hank (Kyle MacLachlan) was responsible for the destruction of Shady Sands, The Brotherhood of Steel was in a heated battle with the New California Republic over control of Griffith Observatory, and Cooper realized that Hank held the answers to the whereabouts of his family. While Hank slipped out in the ensuing chaos and headed to New Vegas, Lucy decided to join Cooper in his quest for answers, which led them into unknown and dangerous territory.\n\nThe first episode of Fallout Season 2, \"The Man Who Knew,\" opens with a brief Pre-War flashback that shows the public protesting against RobCo industries. The scene then takes us inside a bar where a mysterious stranger (Justin Theroux) manages to taunt a group of unemployed workers about how RobCo industries founder Mr. House is more powerful than the government. They then follow him outside, where he attaches a device to the back of one of their heads in return for millions of dollars. Using this device, he’s able to command the man to attack his friends with a baseball bat, but when the mind-controlled man begins to turn against the mysterious stranger, the device makes his head explode in gory fashion.\n\nJumping back to the present, we see that Cooper is captured in Novac by the Great Khans, one of the factions running rampant in the Mojave Wasteland. But when they’re about to execute him, Lucy reveals herself in an iconic sniper perch from Fallout: New Vegas and exposes their plan to rob the Khans of their bottlecaps. She fails a dialogue check and chaos ensues; Cooper is forced to intervene in bloody fashion, reminding audiences once again why he’s one of the best gunslingers in the Wasteland.\n\nIt’s not long after this fight that Cooper reveals that New Vegas survived The Great War, thanks to a missile system designed by Mr. House, which shot the bombs out of the sky. This includes a brief pre-war flashback in which Cooper learns of Vault-Tec and House’s plans for The Great War. He struggles to get his daughter to safety.\n\nChecking in on the residents of Vault 33 in the present, we find Overseer Pearson (Leslie Uggams), who mentions that the vault's water purification chip is broken. Meanwhile, in Vault 32, Stephanie Harper (Annabel O’Hagan) is adjusting to her new life as Overseer and dealing with the needs of her residents and new arrivals from Vault 33. By her side, with child in hand, is Chet (Dave Register), Lucy’s cousin, who is struggling to adjust to his new role as the stepfather of Stephanie’s baby, and dismayed at the mere suggestion that the child be named “Chet Jr.”\n\nFinally, we cut to Vault 31, where Norm (Moises Arias), Lucy’s brother, is held captive by the robo-brain of Bud Askins, a junior vice president of Vault-Tec Industries, after discovering the vault is secretly housing the Vault-Tec executives from before The Great War.\n\nLucy and Cooper continue to follow the trail of dead bodies left in Hank’s wake. They come across a Starlight Drive-In that’s secretly housing Vault 24. Upon further inspection, they find the vault door has been opened and the inside is covered with overgrown vegetation.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper head inside, we get a Pre-War flashback of Cooper reporting his Vault-Tec findings to Lee Moldaver (Sarita Choudhury), who led the NCR during the battle of Griffith Observatory. Moldaver reveals to Cooper that his wife plans to sell Cold Fusion, an infinite power source, to Mr. House. That and his anti-bomb missile system will make him one of the most powerful men in the world once the bombs drop. Knowing this can’t happen, she asks Cooper to assassinate Mr. House--an event we know now never comes to be).\n\nBack in Vault 31, Norm is growing weaker and weaker from a lack of food and water. Bud offers him salvation in the form of going into Hank’s now-empty cryo chamber. With time running out and with few options, Norm decides to make a rash decision and wakes up all the Vault-Tec executives from their slumber. We see the massive number of chambers begin to open up.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper explore Vault 24, they come across numerous communist corpses and find Russian propaganda playing. Lucy realizes the corpses are actually Americans who were being brainwashed to become communists, possibly as a result of one of Vault-Tec's many sick experiments on vault-dwellers. Deeper in the vault, they find a Great Khan with a mind control device similar to the one the mysterious stranger used at the start of the episode. He delivers a message for Lucy straight from her father: “I fix everything. Go home, Sugar Bomb.” Before they can react, his head explodes into gory viscera.\n\nElsewhere, Hank arrives at a secret Vault-Tec facility and changes out of his stolen power armor into something a bit more business appropriate. After enjoying a damn fine cup of coffee, he begins to record a message for an unknown recipient, promising that his work will continue. In a display case is the mysterious stranger’s mind control device with what looks like smaller and smaller upgraded models alongside it, ending the episode.\n\nFallout returns with a bang! While we got answers about the aftermath of the battle for Griffith Observatory, the quest into the Mojave Wasteland provides even more mysteries. What’s Hank truly up to? What will happen to Norm when all of the Vault-Tec executives wake up? Why is New Vegas so important? Who is the mysterious stranger who created the mind control device? We didn’t even get an update on Maximus (Aaron Moten) and the Brotherhood of Steel. So while we rejoined our comrades in this exciting new setting, there’s still plenty more to discover as we dive deeper into Fallout Season 2.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

It’s unclear if “Amazon-type logistics centers” includes Amazon itself, its competitors or other industries.\n\nQuestions also remain about the Louisiana arrest, as officials said that person is linked to a Turtle Island subgroup created by Carroll called the “Order of the Black Lotus” but was “not directly tied” to the Southern California plot.\n\nIt’s possible more arrests are coming, as Essayli said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“As we review that evidence, if we determine there were any other individuals who knew about this or provided any assistance, we will obviously charge them as well,” Essayli said.",

    "fullText": "Southern California is basking in sunshine and unseasonably warm temperatures this week, but forecasters say a holiday twist is on the way.\n\n“We’re still seeing fog for some coastal spots, but inland areas are warming up above average once again,” KTLA weather anchor Kacey Montoya said Monday, noting highs in the low 80s for the Los Angeles Basin. “It’s about 20 degrees above average today, even warmer tomorrow.”\n\nThe National Weather Service said highs will stay in the low 80s through Thursday before cooling into the 70s by the weekend. Air quality remains moderate for most of the region, with a mandatory wood-burning ban in effect through Tuesday for the South Coast Air Basin.\n\nThe NWS long-range forecast shows a Pacific storm could arrive as early as Dec. 22, with snow levels dropping in mountain communities – potentially complicating holiday travel.\n\n“There is a system that is very likely to bring us some widespread precipitation,” Montoya said. “Models don’t agree on when the rain begins or how much.”\n\nBut meteorologists caution that those hoping for a big boost to ski resorts may be disappointed.\n\n“Next week’s stormy pattern does not appear to be a big snowmaker for our area as the upper level trough will pull in moisture from the southwest initially, then a plume from the south joins in on the fun,” the Weather Service said in a bulletin. “Thus temperatures will remain too warm for any significant snow.”",

    "fullText": "For Carson Palmer, the former NFL quarterback and head football coach of the No. 8 Santa Margarita Catholic Eagles, their season officially ended this past Saturday when they defeated No. 17 De La Salle, 47-13, for California’s Open Division state championship.\n\nIn an interview after the win over De La Salle, Palmer stated that he thought his team was playing its best football of the season and wishes his alma mater had one more game left, maybe against a team out of the state of Georgia or another nationally ranked team.\n\n“It’s been an unreal year, from start to finish,” Palmer said to the Los Angeles Times’ Eric Sondheimer. “With the senior class, it has been spectacular. Could not be more proud of these guys, Could not be prouder [of] our coaching staff and support system. This is [an] unbelievable run. We are playing good football. I wish we had a couple more [games] left. Maybe [a] team in Georgia. Maybe somebody else out there.”\n\nThe season might be over for Santa Margarita Catholic, but when Palmer points to his club is playing its best football of the season, he’s got a valid point.\n\nThe Eagles’ recent run of victories includes impressive wins over nationally ranked teams like De La Salle, Corona Centennial, Orange Lutheran, Mater Dei and Sierra Canyon. Palmer mentioning his wishes of his team possibly playing a team out of Georgia or somewhere else possibly points to seeing themselves crowned as a national champion of high school football.\n\nOne would have to wonder what a matchup between Santa Margarita Catholic and a team like Carrollton (Ga.), Buford (Ga.) or St. Frances Academy (Md.), which won the Overtime Nationals championship last week, would’ve been like. All we’re left with is to imagine what that could’ve turned into.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard. This comprehensive resource provides real-time updates and final scores from across the Golden State, ensuring you never miss a moment of the Friday night frenzy.

    "description": "As an EV perk comes to an end, solo drivers must exit the HOV lane or face a fine.",
    "fullText": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nSolo EV drivers using California carpool lanes will face ticketing beginning Monday as the perk disappears.\n\nThough the benefit, courtesy of the California’s Clean Air Vehicle Decal program, technically ended for solo drivers a few months ago, the Department of Motor Vehicles offered a 60-day grace period that ended Monday. Now, solo drivers face fines of up to $490.\n\nWith this, most carpool lanes require vehicles with more than two people.\n\nAs of Aug. 14, more than half a million motorists statewide had an active decal on their vehicle to access carpool lanes. California has an estimated 1,171 carpool lane-miles, with 803 miles in Southern California and 366 miles in Northern California, according to a UC Berkeley study.\n\nWith more than 35 million total registered vehicles in California, that means 1% to 2% of the vehicle fleet will lose access to the carpool lane, said Antonio Bento, professor of public policy and economics at USC.\n\nExperts say the impact for commuters will be minimal with all the solo EV vehicles returning to the general lanes because traffic is already terrible, according to experts.\n\nFederal legislation has allowed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to grant solo drivers in low-emission and energy-efficient cars to use the carpool, or High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV), lane.\n\nThe goal was to promote the adoption of alternative-fuel vehicles and assist in meeting environmental goals that included reducing fuel consumption and pollution caused by congested freeways, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nOver time, states developed incentive programs, choosing which car models to give carpool access to.\n\nCalifornia is one of 13 states that offered this type of incentive program to its residents. Qualified drivers in the Golden State include those who drive fuel cell electric, natural gas or plug-in electric cars.\n\nIn 2015, Congress authorized California’s program through a highway funding bill, but that authorization expired Sept. 30.\n\nIn an effort to extend the decal program, state Assemblymember Greg Wallis (R-Bermuda Dunes) wrote Assembly Bill 2678, which would push the end date to Jan. 1, 2027.\n\nThe bill was signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year.\n\nBut the change never got the required federal approval so the extension was moot.",

While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian.\nA trio of trademark filings were spotted up by MP1st, including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith.",

    "description": "A blended-wing body aircraft is essentially one giant wing with the cabin built inside. Two California companies are racing Airbus to market.",
    "fullText": "Airbus' CEO said the next generation of commercial aircraft could look like the B-2 bomber.\n\nThe design combines the fuselage and wings into one giant wing with the cabin built inside.\n\nIt promises better fuel burn and passenger space, but it may have few windows.\n\nThe future of aviation could look surprisingly similar to the triangular paper airplanes you folded as a kid.\n\nIn an interview with Tobias Fuchs and Martin Murphy at the German newspaper Bild, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said that over the next 30 or 40 years, planemakers may abandon the traditional tube-and-wing layout for a single, thick wing with the passenger cabin built inside.\n\nThis design — known as a \"blended-wing body,\" or BWB — distributes lift across the entire sweeping wing, allowing for heavier carrying capacity and greater efficiency than conventional jets. Faury said a widebody aircraft would be \"better suited\" for the concept.\n\nHe added that the BWB benefits come with trade-offs, including the possibility of eliminating windows. Passengers wouldn't receive any natural light, and some could get disoriented or experience claustrophobia.\n\nEmergency evacuations could also be challenging: passengers and crew would have no view of what's going on outside, and those in the cabin center would be farther from exits than on today's jets.\n\nFaury's comments are the latest sign that Airbus sees opportunity in the blended-wing design, an area where it faces competition from new aircraft makers seeking to beat Airbus to market. The BWB design has a long history.\n\nThe Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bomber — often cited as the best-known \"flying wing\" aircraft — first flew in 1989. Although the BWB concept dates back even further, renewed interest emerged in the early 1990s when McDonnell Douglas explored a blended-wing transport idea that eventually evolved into the BWB-17 in partnership with NASA.\n\nAfter McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1997, Boeing continued the work with NASA to produce the X-48 series of subscale demonstrators until the program ended in 2013.\n\nBut, to date, no full-size passenger BWB has been certified or flown, and Boeing has not announced plans to develop its own.\n\nFor its part, Airbus has been exploring BWBs since 2017, and the company's 200-person design is a key pillar of its ZEROe initiative for zero-emission aviation.\n\nIn 2019, the company flew a small-scale demonstrator that showed potential major fuel savings — estimated at around 20% — and new cabin layouts made possible by the wider interior. The long-term vision includes running these aircraft on hydrogen rather than traditional jet fuel.",

    "description": "Paul Thomas Anderson's movie \"One Battle After Another\" has a thrilling car-chase scene that was filmed on location in California.",
    "fullText": "\"One Battle After Another\" production designer Florencia Martin was driving near the California-Arizona border with director Paul Thomas Anderson on a location scout when they came across a unique stretch of road.\n\nAfter miles and miles of flat roadway cut through the middle of the desert, the topography was suddenly rocky, and the road's dips became so dramatic that they looked like big concrete waves stretching as far as the eye could see.\n\n\"Paul took out his phone and started recording out the car window,\" Martin told Business Insider.\n\nNo one in the car knew it yet, but they'd just found the thrilling ending to their movie.\n\nAnderson's latest epic, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an ex-revolutionary who is forced back into the cause to save his daughter Willa (Chase Infiniti) from a deranged military officer (Sean Penn), ends with a tense car-chase scene in which the contours of the road play a key role.\n\nThat only happened because of a stroke of luck. The movie's location manager, Michael Glaser, had taken Martin and Anderson on a three-hour drive from Los Angeles to Blythe, California, to scout a spot for the revolutionaries' camp. On the ride back to LA, they took a different route — one that sent them through a stretch of road outside Borrego Springs, California, that locals call \"The Texas Dip\" for the enormity of its drops.\n\nSoon after that trip, Martin received a new version of the script from Anderson in which the car chase scene ended on \"The Texas Dip.\"\n\nThe thrilling sequence, in which Infiniti's Willa outsmarts an assassin using the road's hills and the angle of the sun, wasn't easy to shoot. The team had scouted the location in the winter, but shot the scene in the summer, so they had to adjust their shooting schedule based on the sun's direction on the road at that time of year. And then there was the unforgiving environment.\n\n\"It was 110 degrees, people had heat exhaustion, there was wind, the dirt would get into the camera and jam it,\" said Martin, whose credits include 2022's \"Babylon\" and Anderson's 2021 movie \"Licorice Pizza.\" \"It was the harshest conditions you could imagine.\"\n\nIt was all worth it once Martin saw the car chase sequence for the first time with an audience.\n\n\"People actually gasped when watching it,\" she said. \"What's special about the way Paul works and being in these locations is you feel it on screen, the dirt on Willa's face, feeling the heat come off the road.\"\n\nMartin still can't believe the sequence is being compared to classic car-chase scenes in movie history.\n\n\"The fact that our movie is compared to movies we've watched like \"The French Connection\" and \"Vanishing Point,\" that are iconic, it's a huge honor,\" she said.\n\n\"One Battle After Another\" is now playing in theaters.",

    "title": "Airbus CEO said the future of commercial aviation could be a B-2 bomber-like plane with a cabin in the wing",
    "description": "A blended-wing body aircraft is essentially one giant wing with the cabin built inside. Two California companies are racing Airbus to market.",
    "fullText": "The future of aviation could look surprisingly similar to the triangular paper airplanes you folded as a kid.\n\nIn an interview with Tobias Fuchs and Martin Murphy at the German newspaper Bild, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said that over the next 30 or 40 years, planemakers may abandon the traditional tube-and-wing layout for a single, thick wing with the passenger cabin built inside.\n\nThis design — known as a \"blended-wing body,\" or BWB — distributes lift across the entire sweeping wing, allowing for heavier carrying capacity and greater efficiency than conventional jets. Faury said a widebody aircraft would be \"better suited\" for the concept.\n\nHe added that the BWB benefits come with trade-offs, including the possibility of eliminating windows. Passengers wouldn't receive any natural light, and some could get disoriented or experience claustrophobia.\n\nEmergency evacuations could also be challenging: passengers and crew would have no view of what's going on outside, and those in the cabin center would be farther from exits than on today's jets.\n\nFaury's comments are the latest sign that Airbus sees opportunity in the blended-wing design, an area where it faces competition from new aircraft makers seeking to beat Airbus to market. The BWB design has a long history.\n\nThe Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bomber — often cited as the best-known \"flying wing\" aircraft — first flew in 1989. Although the BWB concept dates back even further, renewed interest emerged in the early 1990s when McDonnell Douglas explored a blended-wing transport idea that eventually evolved into the BWB-17 in partnership with NASA.\n\nAfter McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1997, Boeing continued the work with NASA to produce the X-48 series of subscale demonstrators until the program ended in 2013.\n\nBut, to date, no full-size passenger BWB has been certified or flown, and Boeing has not announced plans to develop its own.\n\nFor its part, Airbus has been exploring BWBs since 2017, and the company's 200-person design is a key pillar of its ZEROe initiative for zero-emission aviation.\n\nIn 2019, the company flew a small-scale demonstrator that showed potential major fuel savings — estimated at around 20% — and new cabin layouts made possible by the wider interior. The long-term vision includes running these aircraft on hydrogen rather than traditional jet fuel.\n\nBut despite the early momentum, Airbus has pushed its initial ZEROe 2035 timeline by as much as 10 years.\n\nAirbus has cited challenges surrounding certification complexity, limited global hydrogen infrastructure, and uncertainty around passenger acceptance — especially when some seats could be positioned far from natural light.\n\nStill, the BWB race is far from just an Airbus effort.\n\nAviation startups like Natilus and JetZero are betting that the unconventional BWB shape could help crack the traditional Boeing-Airbus duopoly, with both targeting launches in the early 2030s.\n\nSan Diego-based Natilus is developing a narrowbody version called Horizon to rival the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, promising about 25% lower fuel burn but 40% more cabin space. And it can fit into existing airport infrastructure.\n\nCompany CEO Aleksey Matyushev previously told Business Insider that the industry could face a shortfall of roughly 40,000 narrowbody jets over the next 20 years — a number he said is far more than the two legacy players can realistically supply.\n\nMatyushev added that Horizon's larger cabin footprint could allow for wider seats, dedicated family areas, and other special features that go beyond what today's narrowbody jets offer.\n\nRenderings of Horizon's proposed cabin, released in July, show up to three aisles instead of the traditional one or two. Matyushev confirmed to Business Insider that the jet will have windows throughout.\n\nPassengers in the center seats will still be farther from the windows, but Natilus said it is adding skylights and other lighting strategies to mimic the outside.\n\nMeanwhile, 100 miles north in Long Beach, JetZero is pursuing a widebody version called the \"Z4\" that promises up to 50% lower fuel burn and could replace jets like the Boeing 767 and Airbus A330.\n\nThe plane would have similar advantages to Horizon in terms of airport compatibility and seat layout.\n\nJetZero has already attracted interest from United Airlines. In April, United Airlines Ventures, the division that invests in these innovative aircraft, said it planned to buy up to 200 of JetZero's 250-seat Z4s.\n\nManaging director Andrew Chang previously told Business Insider that the aircraft's expansive interior could be game changer that feels like a \"living room in the sky.\"\n\nJetZero successfully flew a subscale prototype called Pathfinder in 2024.",
