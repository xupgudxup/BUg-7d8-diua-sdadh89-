    "fullText": "Marcus Mariota injury update: Latest news on Commanders QB's status in Week 16 game originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Washington Commanders have an injury concern with quarterback Marcus Mariota in the Week 16 game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nMariota got banged-up in the third quarter. He stayed down on one knee after a play and was clearly shaken-up.\n\nIf Mariota can't return, veteran quarterback Josh Johnson will take the reins of the offense. Jayden Daniels is not available after being shut down for the season. The Commanders do not have a third quarterback available after Mariota and Johnson.\n\nFollow our tracker below for the latest updates on Mariota's status for the rest of the game against Philly.\n\nUPDATE: The Commanders are back on offense and Johnson is still in the game, so it looks like Mariota isn't returning. The team has not confirmed that, though.\n\nUPDATE: Mariota is now out of the locker room and back on the sideline, but he still has his right hand wrapped and hasn't grabbed his helmet. Not a good sign for his chances of returning.\n\nUPDATE: Mariota was evaluated for a concussion, but was cleared. However, the Commanders also revealed he is dealing with a right hand injury and is now questionable to return.\n\nUPDATE: Mariota is now heading to the locker room, according to Nicki Jhabvala of The Athletic. That is a bad sign for his chances of returning to the game.\n\nESPN's John Keim adds that Mariota had his throwing hand wrapped in a towel, so that appears to be his injury.\n\nStill no update from the team, though.\n\nMariota is headed to the medical tent to get checked out. It remains unclear exactly what he's dealing with.\n\nWe'll update this page once more information is available.\n\nNFL insider reveals Commanders' decision on Dan Quinn's future\n\nSaints rumor from Ian Rapoport gives definite answer on Kellen Moore's future\n\nAdam Schefter pinpoints head coaching job that will be \"highly attractive\"\n\nSeahawks accomplish feat never done in franchise history vs. Rams",

    "fullText": "Washington State improved to 5-8 with its second consecutive win, defeating the Mercer Bears 84-78. Mercer, out of the Southern Conference, traveled to Pullman at 7–4 looking to snap a two-game skid.\n\nKenPom projected a 79-75 win for the Cougars, and the betting line sat at WSU -7.5.\n\nThe game got off to a shaky start as the Cougs surrendered a wide-open three to Mercer, and ND Oakafor picked up an early technical foul.\n\nThe teams traded buckets early, with the Cougs coming out hot and scoring 13 points in the first four minutes. However, the offense soon went stagnant, as turnover issues plagued Washington State once again. The Cougs managed just two points over the next six minutes.\n\nDefensive struggles resurfaced for WSU, allowing Mercer to score 25 points in the first ten minutes. Ace Glass helped keep the Cougars afloat, starting 5-of-8 from the floor.\n\nDefensive intensity picked up for Washington State, but the Bears reached the bonus with five minutes remaining in the half due to several chintzy off-ball fouls.\n\nThere was very little separation between the teams in the first half. Glass scored 14 points before the break, and the Cougs shot an impressive 59% from the field. Despite that efficiency, WSU led by just two, 41–39. Eight turnovers allowed Mercer to attempt eight more shots than Washington State.\n\nThe Cougs opened the second half strong, highlighted by a deep three from Glass that pushed the lead to five. Mercer responded immediately and tied the game.\n\nAdria Rodriguez delivered a strong defensive performance, recording a steal and a score and making his presence felt throughout the game. Adria seems to be playing far more confident than earlier in the season, coming up with 7 points as-well.\n\nThen the Cougars finally erupted. WSU hit eight straight field goals, including three triples from Ri Vavers, stretching the lead to 14.\n\nWashington State had opportunities to put the game away but failed to capitalize, missing multiple easy looks off turnovers. ND Oakafor also missed two free throws after a missed dunk. The lead never grew beyond fourteen.\n\nCoach David Riley later went to a lineup in which Thrastarson was the primary scoring threat, and the offense went ice cold.\n\nThe Cougs slowed down near the finish line as Mercer’s Baraka Okojie continued to knock down mid-range jumpers. The Bears extended the game with fouling and quick shots but never cut the deficit to fewer than five points.\n\nGlass finished with 24 points on 8-of-14 shooting. It was a balanced offensive effort for the Cougars, with four other players scoring in double figures. Eemeli Yalaho posted a strong performance with 14 points and eight rebounds, while Rihards Vavers came off the bench to hit four three-pointers. WSU shot 54% from the floor, and sunk 11 of their 23 three-point attempts.\n\nThis had the makings of a comfortable win for the Cougars, who entered the game ranked 154th in KenPom among a group of teams with winning records. However, the finish left much to be desired, as WSU effectively put on the brakes. The Cougs could have won by 20 or more, but instead escaped with a six-point victory.\n\nWashington State has played much better since returning from the Maui Invitational, holding opponents under 80 points in six straight games after allowing 80-plus in five of their first six contests. At 5-8, the Cougs have dropped four swing-games to Idaho, Arizona State, Bradley, and USC.\n\nUSC currently ranks 39th in KenPom, Arizona State sits at 64th, and Bradley at 119th, showing that Washington State has competed well against solid opponents recently.\n\nHopefully, David Riley can build on this two-game winning streak as conference play approaches. The Cougs will make a brief Pacific Northwest swing, facing the Portland Pilots in Portland on December 28 before traveling to Seattle to take on the Redhawks on December 30. Seattle U recently upset Washington and sits at 10-2, setting up a fun matchup for Coug fans at Climate Pledge Arena.\n\nWashington State’s next contest, at the University of Portland, will air on ESPN+ at 2:00 p.m. on December 28.",

They will now look to finish the season on a high note, starting with Los Angeles and ending with the two road matchups versus the Commanders and the New York Giants.\n\nA lot of questions will need to be answered this offseason in Dallas, as the franchise has won just two playoff games since 2016, the beginning of the Dak Prescott era, and is still in danger of posting a third losing season in six years.\n\nJosh Jacobs, Christian Watson playing statuses revealed as Packers release inactives\n\nIs D'Andre Swift playing tonight?

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (DC News Now) — D.C.’s outgoing police chief did not mince words Friday, delivering a blunt and harsh speech during her walkout ceremony.\n\n“I’m going to the bible when I say to my haters, F you,” said Chief Pamela Smith. “No, it’s not a drop the mic moment. Watch me in this space. I forgive you. I forgive you.”\n\nSmith announced her resignation, effective Dec. 31, earlier this month.\n\nIt comes amid federal scrutiny and an interim House Oversight Committee report that accused Smith of creating a toxic work environment and pressuring officers to manipulate crime data.\n\nDC interim police chief plans to lead with ‘integrity’ ‘transparency’ after Pamela Smith’s resignation\n\nSmith denied all allegations of manipulating crime data, invoking her faith in God and delivering a sermon-like speech.\n\n“Never would I, never will, compromise my integrity for a few crime numbers. I said it and it’s on the record,” said Smith. “Never would I compromise my love for God, the faith I have in this city. Never would I compromise my integrity, never would I compromise 28 years in law enforcement for a few folks who couldn’t stand to be held accountable. And if I had to do it all over again, I’d do it again.”\n\nSmith was appointed as chief of police in 2023 amid a crime spike in the District. That year, the city saw 274 homicides.\n\nIn 2024, the number dropped to 182. To date this year, there have been 126 homicides.\n\n“I don’t have to talk about what I’ve done in this city,” said Smith. “May the work I’ve done speak for me.”\n\nSmith closed with another strong message.\n\n“The same folks that said in their reports that they changed their numbers and I did not, the report said I did not direct anyone, you should investigate those folks,” she said.\n\nEarlier this week, Mayor Muriel Bowser appointed Jeffery Carroll as interim police chief.\n\nHe’ll be sworn in following Smith’s final day.

He has since credited increased film study and early arrivals at the facility for his Week 15 dominance -- something he aims to sustain.\n\nBullen confirmed Carter's renewed commitment.\n\n\"He's been foot on the gas,\" Bullen said. \"He's even brought a couple teammates with him this week, too.\"\n\nThe coordinator highlighted the rookie's growth, noting that \"the production on the field was validation for the improvements and commitment he made to the process.\"\n\nAddressing rookie hurdles, Bullen preached experience above all -- something Carter gains each week.\n\n\"There's an element of it that the players have to experience it and feel that for themselves,\" he said. \"You don't know what you don't know.\"\n\nBullen credited Carter for responding positively to learning moments and leaning deeper into the process.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Charlie Bullen lauds Abdul Carter's breakthrough after benchings",

    "description": "I rode in business class on the Amtrak NextGen Acela train from NYC to Washington, DC, for $180. It was a great experience, but not worth the price.",
    "fullText": "The Amtrak Acela is an express service between Boston and Washington, DC. The train line introduced a new fleet on the route in August 2025, known as NextGen Acela.\n\nIn addition to being the fastest Amtrak train with a top speed of 160 miles per hour, the NextGen Acela has modern interiors and high-tech amenities.\n\nThe Amtrak Acela trains only have two classes — business and first. I booked my business-class ticket for $180.\n\nOut of curiosity, I looked at the pricing for coach seating on the regional Amtrak train, which is 30 minutes slower than the Acela. It was $40.\n\nMy train was scheduled to leave at 10 a.m., but there was a 90-minute delay. Since I was stuck at the station for longer than anticipated, I briefly considered going to the Metropolitan Lounge, an elevated space overlooking the train hall with cozy seating and complimentary refreshments.\n\nFirst-class passengers and those traveling in sleeper accommodations can get into the lounge for free, but other Amtrak riders have to pay $50 to access it.\n\nSince I'd already splurged on the business-class ticket, I decided to skip the lounge and head to the standard waiting room instead, but it was full. I finally settled for a seat on the floor against the wall until it was time to board.\n\nWhen I got in line to board, I was reminded that business class is just a standard ticket on the Amtrak Acela. Unlike business-class rides I've taken that also had coach seating, this trip didn't include the perk of priority boarding.\n\nSoft, cushy, spacious, supportive — these are the words that popped into my head when I settled into my business-class seat. A reclining function and footrest made the ride even more comfortable.\n\nPower outlets, USB ports, and a reading light were all conveniently located on the side of the seat. In front of me was a tray table and a fold-out cupholder.\n\nMost Amtrak trains I've been on have had WiFi, but in my experience, the connection has typically been too weak for much more than a Google search.\n\nI was stoked when the NextGen Acela's 5G WiFi was fast enough to stream YouTube videos without any issues. I passed the time by watching live sessions of my favorite bands.\n\nI've learned to set the bar low for train bathrooms. Stocked toilet paper, soap, and paper towels are not a given. Cleanliness and extra space aren't either. In my experience, some business-class bathrooms are no different from those in coach.\n\nSo I was ecstatic when I stepped inside the lavatory on the NextGen Acela. The automatic door opened into a spotless space that felt big enough for two people to do jumping jacks simultaneously.\n\nI found it aesthetically pleasing too, with bold red accents and trendy touches, from the shelf to the mirror.\n\nI also appreciated the touchless water, soap, and dryer functions on the sink.\n\n\"Amtrak travelers always have their preference,\" an Amtrak representative wrote in an email to Business Insider. \"If they want to experience these premium trains with enhanced amenities, they can. Or, if they prefer convenient and affordable downtown-to-downtown service up and down the Northeast Corridor, Northeast Regional trains offer a comfortable and enjoyable way to travel throughout the Northeast Corridor and points beyond.\"\n\nThe next time I take an Amtrak train, I'll miss the cozy seat, elevated bathroom, high-speed WiFi, and shorter travel time. Still, these perks weren't enough for me to consider Acela's business class to be worth more than quadruple the price of a coach ticket.",

He ran for 523 yards this season.\n\nMohammed spent the last two seasons in Seattle and took on a larger role in 2025. He took 106 carries for 523 yards and five touchdowns as a sophomore and had 17 receptions for 138 yards in the passing game.\n\nAs a freshman in 2024, Adam Mohammed ran for 193 yards while adding 41 receiving yards. A product of Glendale (Ariz.) Apollo, he will have two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.\n\nThe On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\nWashington put together a strong second season under Jedd Fisch in 2025, completing a 9-4 campaign with a victory over Boise State in the LA Bowl last week. Quarterback Demond Williams shined in his first year as the full-time starter, completing 69.5% of his passes for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns, to eight interceptions. He also added 611 rush yards and six touchdowns on the ground.\n\nAfterward, Fisch discussed the importance of keeping core players in tact as he gets ready for Year 3. He said the goal is to maintain as much continuity as possible on the roster, and he specifically pointed to Williams’ importance given the way he played throughout the year.\n\n“I thought, if you look at Raiden Vines probably had his first touchdown, he’s a freshman,” Fisch said in his LA Bowl press conference. “Dezmen Roebuck back had his seventh touchdown of the season. He’s a freshman. Demond played elite. He’s a sophomore. We play with probably the most freshmen in all of college football. Plays that were being made by guys were all young players. Players for the most part that all have eligibility left.\n\n“Our goal obviously is to bring back as many players as we possibly can. I think our guys know that we’ve got a great season coming ahead of us. We’ve got a great team. They’re led by an elite player. When you have an elite quarterback, you’ve got a great opportunity to win a lot of games.”",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "fullText": "Growth in the US economy – and the president’s political survival – rest on AI. The EU must use its leverage and stand up to him\n\nThe unthinkable has happened. The US is Europe’s adversary. The stark, profound betrayal contained in the Trump administration’s national security strategy should stop any further denial and dithering in Europe’s capitals. Cultivating “resistance Europe’s current trajectory in European nations” is now Washington’s stated policy.\n\nBut contained within this calamity is the gift of clarity. Europe will fight or it will perish. The good news is that Europe holds strong cards.\n\nThe US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every Maga voter’s pension is bound to the bubble’s precarious survival. AI investment now rivals consumer spending as the primary creator of American economic growth. It accounted for virtually all (92%) GDP growth in the first half of this year. Without it, US GDP grew only 0.1%. Despite Donald Trump’s posturing, he is on shaky economic ground.\n\nTrump’s political coalition is shaky, too. In July and again this month, he has been unable to force Senate Republicans to pass his AI moratorium bill, which would have prevented states from drafting their own AI laws. The Steve Bannon wing of Maga fears that AI will displace workers en masse, and is appalled by what children are exposed to on digital platforms. Maga voters particularly mistrust big tech’s political power. Tech is a dangerous topic for Trump.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has two cards to play that might pop the AI bubble. If she does so, Trump’s presidency will be thrown into crisis.\n\nFirst, Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon. These machines are essential for Nvidia, the AI microchip giant that is now the world’s most valuable company. ASML is one of Europe’s most valuable companies, and European banks and private equity are also invested in AI. Withholding these silicon-etching machines would be difficult for Europe, and extremely painful for the Dutch economy. But it would be far more painful for Trump.\n\nThe US’s feverish investment in AI and the datacentres it relies on will hit a wall if European export controls slow or stop exports to the US – and to Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its most advanced chips. Via this lever, Europe has the means to decide whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.\n\nSecond, and much easier for Europe, is the enforcement of the EU’s long-neglected data rules against big US tech companies. Confidential corporate documents made public in US litigation show how vulnerable companies such as Google can be to the enforcement of basic data rules. Meanwhile, Meta has been unable to tell a US court what its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.\n\nThis data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data. All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has been a wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.\n\nIf the EU had the gumption to apply this pressure, these US tech companies would have to rebuild their technologies from the ground up to handle data correctly. They would also have to tell investors that their AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable market until they comply. The AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock.\n\nMaga voters did not vote to lose their liberties and constitutional rights, and an increasingly authoritarian Trump who cannot deliver economic stability because of his closeness to a reviled tech industry is likely to be deeply unpopular in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe balance of risk now demands that European leaders cripple Trump. They have learned from a year of abject cowering before Trump that such behaviour only makes it easy for him to push them over. The reasons for caution are disappearing. The extreme reaction of Maga leaders to the relatively minor €120m fine the EC recently imposed on X shows that pulling punches will not placate them. Trump’s “28-point plan” for Ukraine dispelled any illusion that European concessions would secure a return to US military commitment.\n\nWith its democracy now explicitly under threat, Europe must join India, Brazil and China in standing up to Trump.\n\nBrazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an example of how to do so. He has been dignified and resolute in the face of extraordinary bullying from Trump. In a single month, in September, he proclaimed in an open letter to Trump that his country’s democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable, countered Trump’s tariffs with its own and passed a new law forcing digital platforms to protect children in Brazil from sexual harassment and other online harms.\n\nThen he rhetorically mugged Trump in a UN general assembly speech just before Trump’s turn to speak. As a result of Lula’s refusal to be cowed, Trump softened his tone immediately. Lower tariffs are now expected after negotiations between the two leaders.\n\nTrump said earlier in December that he thinks Europe’s leaders are weak. He does not believe they will defend Europeans’ liberties and their hard-won democracy against him. So far, the response from European leaders is proving him correct. But what Trump does not yet understand is that von der Leyen holds the US economy and his presidency in her hands. She must have the courage to go entirely beyond any prior norms of her behaviour. In other words, if she grabs Trump where it hurts, Europe will win this fight.\n\nJohnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties",

The receiver will end his season having only played in four games. Replacing Brown will be an old friend, Chris Moore, who is being promoted from the practice squad. Moore spent most of the season on the roster, but was released to make room for Brown and then re-signed to the practice squad.\n\nWide receiver River Cracraft will take Moore's practice squad spot, and tight end Gee Scott Jr. was also added to the practice squad.

    "fullText": "Pledge to invest billions in UK paused, with Washington citing lack of progress on trade barriers across pond\n\nThe US has paused its promised multi-billion-pound investment into British tech over trade disagreements, marking a serious setback in US-UK relations.\n\nThe £31bn “tech prosperity deal”, hailed by Keir Starmer as “a generational stepchange in our relationship with the US” when it was announced during Donald Trump’s state visit, has been put on ice by Washington.\n\nAs part of the deal, US tech companies pledged to spend billions in the UK, including a £22bn investment from Microsoft and £5bn from Google. But Washington has paused the implementation of the agreement, citing a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.\n\nBritish officials sought to downplay the development, which was first reported by the New York Times. The newspaper said Trump’s administration was unhappy about the UK continuing to levy a digital services tax on American tech companies and its food safety rules, which bar the export of certain agricultural products.\n\nOne British government source said it was “the usual bit of hardball negotiations by the Americans” and said that the deal to allow tariff-free British pharmaceutical exports to the US was on and off before it was finalised.\n\n“[The US commerce secretary] Howard Lutnick is a tough guy. We understand that the Americans negotiate incredibly hard but we’ll stand our ground. They want what’s best for their country, we want what’s best for ours,” the source said.\n\nA second government source said the development was “part of the shape of the negotiations” with Washington.\n\nThe prosperity deal included the creation of an artificial intelligence “growth zone” in the north-east of England, which UK officials said could bring in up to £30bn and create 5,000 jobs.\n\nBut the text of the agreement stated that it only “becomes operative alongside substantive progress being made to formalise and implement” it.\n\nThe decision to put it on hold is a blow to the UK government, which touted the agreement as a prize of its intensive year-long engagement with the US to avoid punitive tariffs on British exports. As part of his diplomatic charm offensive, Starmer hosted Trump for a second state visit at Windsor Castle in September, an unprecedented honour for a US president.\n\nStarmer has resisted US pressure to scrap or amend the digital services tax, a 2% levy on the revenues of tech companies including Amazon, Google and Apple that raises about £800m a year. Trump has repeatedly threatened to retaliate against countries with digital taxes, including the UK.\n\nThe Guardian revealed that during trade negotiations in the spring, the government drew up proposals to reduce the amount paid by US tech companies and by applying the tax to a wider range of companies without reducing its total take. But so far the tax has remained unchanged.\n\nThe US has also exerted pressure over the UK’s online safety rules, with officials promising to review their enforcement during the talks.\n\nA third area of contention has been the UK’s food safety regime, with ministers admitting that the US has raised objections to it. As part of the trade deal the government agreed to lower tariffs on some US agricultural products including beef, but it has stood by its manifesto commitment not to water down farming standards.\n\nAny decision to weaken these could open the door to American chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef being sold in Britain, a prospect that has long been highly controversial with farmers and consumer groups.\n\nAt a press conference at Chequers in September, where he unveiled the tech prosperity deal, Starmer said it had “the power to change lives” and “renewed the special relationship for a new era”.\n\n“It’s our chance to ensure that technologies like AI, quantum and others amplify human potential, solve problems, cure diseases, make us richer and freer, strengthen democracy not tyranny,” the prime minister said. “This is the territory on which the future will be won.”\n\nTrump at the time said the deal would help the US and UK “dominate” in the world of artificial intelligence and “ensure our countries lead the next great technological revolution side by side”.\n\nPeter Kyle, the business and trade secretary, was in the US last week for negotiations with Lutnick, the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, and the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Their discussions touched on whisky and steel tariffs and collaboration on critical minerals. Kyle’s department said talks were due to continue in January.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the tech prosperity deal delivers opportunity for hard-working people in both countries.”\n\nThe Guardian reported at the weekend that Starmer was poised to choose his new ambassador to Washington after interviewing the three finalists last week. The three shortlisted candidates are the prime minister’s business adviser, Varun Chandra, who was central to negotiating the prosperity deal; Christian Turner, the incoming ambassador to the UN; and Nigel Casey, the ambassador to Russia.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has revealed the White House’s domestic priority, and it’s not bringing down costs or addressing the looming healthcare crisis.\n\nSpeaking at a holiday party on Sunday, the president described his aspirations for a triumphal arch in Washington, D.C., as White House Domestic Policy Council head Vince Haley’s “primary thing.”\n\n“It’s something that is so special. Uh, it will be like the one in, in Paris, but to be honest with you, it blows it away. Blows it away in every way,” Trump said. “And Vince came in one day and his eyes were teeming. I mean, he couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. He saw it and he wanted to do that. That’s your primary thing.”\n\nHaley previously served as a speechwriter for Trump and as a longtime aide for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n\n“Vince is unbelievable on policy. And we have a policy thing that’s going to be unbelievable happening,” he said of the proposed arch.\n\nTrump has spent months attempting to remake D.C. in his MAGAfied image, including paving over the White House Rose Garden, demolishing the East Wing, breaking ground on a $300 million ballroom, and announcing plans for other new construction around the nation’s capital—none of which has undergone the necessary legal reviews.\n\nIn October, he announced he wanted to build a knock-off of the Arc de Triomphe that would rival the Lincoln Memorial in scale. Sources say Trump has been presented with three different designs, but unsurprisingly he is reportedly most excited about a $100 million white-and-gold monstrosity.\n\n“We’re building an arc, like the Arc de Triomphe, and we’re building it, uh, by the Arlington Bridge, the Arlington Cemetery, uh, opposite the Lincoln Memorial. You could say Jefferson, Washington, everything, ’cause they’re all right there,” Trump described the project on Sunday.\n\nThe president has solicited private donations for the project, which would ostensibly commemorate the 250th anniversary of the United States, and has doubled down on the idea even as his approval ratings have cratered over his administration’s failure to rein in the cost of living.\n\nThe president’s own voters increasingly blame him for high prices, and last week, Trump launched a national tour to try to convince voters his economic policies are working—despite the fact that many Americans are cutting back on buying gifts this holiday season.\n\nThen there’s the fact that Republicans still don’t have a plan for bringing down healthcare costs after the latest GOP spending bill cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending and failed to extend health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHealthcare premiums for about 22 million Americans will skyrocket next year after the ACA credits expire, with the average recipient seeing their premiums double.\n\nBut to Trump, the more pressing issue is apparently that Washington is “the only city in the world that’s of great importance that doesn’t have a triumphal arch,” he said Sunday.\n\n“This one is gonna blow ‘em all away. The one that people know mostly is the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France. And, uh, we’re gonna top it by I think a lot,” he said.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.",
    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.\n\nThe officials said talks with President Donald Trump’s envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, led to narrowing differences on security guarantees that Kyiv said must be provided, as well as on Moscow’s demand that Ukraine concede land in the Donbas region in the country’s east.\n\nTrump dialed into a dinner Monday evening with negotiators and European leaders, and more talks are expected this weekend in Miami or elsewhere in the United States, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly by the White House.\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump told reporters at an unrelated White House event. He added, “We’re having tremendous support from European leaders. They want to get it ended, also.\"\n\nThe U.S. officials said the offer of security guarantees won’t be on the table “forever.” They said the Trump administration plans to put forward the agreement on guarantees for Senate approval, although they didn’t specify whether it would be ratified like a treaty, which needs the chamber's two-thirds approval.\n\nIn a statement, European leaders in Berlin said they and the U.S. committed to work together to provide “robust security guarantees,” including a European-led ”multinational force Ukraine\" supported by the U.S.\n\nThey said the force's work would include \"operating inside Ukraine\" as well as assisting in rebuilding Ukraine's forces, securing its skies and supporting safer seas. They said Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.\n\nWitkoff and Kushner were accompanied by U.S. Air Force Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who heads NATO's military operations and the U.S. European Command, as talks honed in on the particulars of what the U.S. officials described as an “Article 5-like” security agreement. Article Five in the NATO treaty is the collective defense clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all.\n\nThe U.S. side presented the Ukrainians a document that spelled out in greater specificity aspects of the proposed U.S. security guarantees — something that Ukrainian officials said was missing from earlier iterations of the U.S. peace proposal, according to U.S. officials.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it a “truly far-reaching, substantial agreement that we did not have before, namely that both Europe and the U.S. are jointly prepared to do this.”\n\nQuestions over Ukraine's postwar security and the fate of occupied territories have been the main obstacles in talks. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil.\n\nZelenskyy on Monday called the talks “substantial” and noted that differences remain on the issue of territory.\n\nZelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine’s preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.\n\nUkraine has continued to reject the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control as a key condition for peace.\n\nThe U.S. officials on Monday said there is consensus on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan, and that Russia has indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the European Union, something it previously said it did not object to.\n\nThe Russian president has cast Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, however, as a major threat to Moscow’s security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nAsked whether the negotiations could be over by Christmas, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said trying to predict a potential time frame for a peace deal was a “thankless task.”\n\n“I can only speak for the Russian side, for President Putin,” Peskov said. “He is open to peace, to a serious peace and serious decisions. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.”\n\nPutin has denied plans to attack any European allies.\n\nRussia fired 153 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said 133 drones were neutralized, while 17 more hit their targets.\n\nIn Russia, the Defense Ministry on Monday said forces destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones overnight. An additional 16 drones were destroyed between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time.\n\nEighteen drones were shot down over Moscow itself, the defense ministry said. Flights were temporarily halted at the city’s Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports as part of safety measures, officials said.\n\nDamage details and casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington. Seung Min Kim and Darlene Superville in Washington; Pietro De Cristofaro in Berlin; Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine; and Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed to this report.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",

    "fullText": "A United Airlines flight bound for Tokyo was forced to return to Washington Dulles International Airport on Saturday after losing power in one of its engines shortly after takeoff, triggering a brush fire on the ground and prompting a federal investigation. The Boeing 777-200 was carrying 275 passengers when the incident occurred, according to the airline.\n\nUnited Flight 803 departed Dulles around 12:35 p.m. en route to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. After the engine issue was detected, the aircraft circled the area for just under an hour before landing safely back at Dulles. United said there were eight crew members aboard and no injuries were reported.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a post on X that a piece of the jet’s engine cover broke off after takeoff, sparking a brush fire near the runway. He added that the Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident.\n\nI've been briefed on United Flight 803 from Dulles to Japan. \n\nHere’s what we know:\n -An engine failed on the Boeing 777-200ER shortly after take-off\n -275 passengers, 15 crew members on board\n -A piece of the engine cover separated and caught fire, sparking a brush fire on… https://t.co/IxkFJU2Fes\n\n— Secretary Sean Duffy (@SecDuffy) December 13, 2025\n\nEmily McGee, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, said the fire was quickly extinguished and that airport fire and rescue crews evaluated the aircraft after it returned. Smoke from the brush fire was visible across the tarmac as other flights continued arriving and departing.\n\nThe incident briefly disrupted operations at Dulles and drew the attention of passengers across the airport.\n\nHouman David Hemmati, a California-based ophthalmologist, was seated on a separate United flight bound for Los Angeles when his pilot announced a ground stop.\n\n“We are on a ground stop,” the pilot told passengers, Hemmati said. “There’s an incident on the runway.”\n\nLooking out his window, Hemmati said he saw thick smoke rising near the runway, illuminated by flashing emergency vehicles. He took photos and posted on X, writing, “Praying it’s not a crash.”\n\nHemmati’s flight was later diverted to another runway and allowed to depart around 1 p.m. As the plane climbed, he said smoke was still visible below.\n\nCommercial aircraft are designed to fly safely on a single engine, particularly during critical phases like takeoff. Pilots train extensively for engine failures, and standard protocol typically calls for returning to the departure airport when a problem occurs shortly after liftoff.\n\nKey details from the incident include:\n\nFlight: United Airlines Flight 803\n\nPassengers: 275 passengers and eight crew members\n\nIssue: Loss of power in one engine after takeoff\n\nGround impact: Engine cover debris sparked a brush fire\n\nOutcome: Safe return to Dulles with no reported injuries\n\nNext step: FAA investigation underway\n\nUnited praised the response of its crews and airport personnel in a statement released Saturday.\n\n“United is grateful to our crews and to the teams at Washington Dulles for their quick work to help ensure the safety of everyone involved,” the airline said. United added that it is working to rebook passengers on a later flight.\n\nThe FAA has not released details on what caused the engine cover to detach or whether the aircraft had any prior maintenance issues. Investigators are expected to examine flight data, maintenance records, and debris from the engine as part of the inquiry.\n\nThe Boeing 777 remains one of the most widely used wide-body aircraft in international travel, but any engine-related issue shortly after takeoff draws immediate scrutiny from regulators.\n\nFor passengers aboard Flight 803, the incident ended without injury but with a tense delay to an already long journey. For United and federal investigators, the focus now turns to determining what failed and whether any broader inspections are needed.\n\nThe FAA’s findings will ultimately determine whether the incident was an isolated mechanical failure or part of a larger concern.",

    "description": "Tracking every incoming and outgoing player from Washington in the transfer portal this cycle",
    "fullText": "This is your place to keep track of everything Husky related in the transfer portal this season. The portal still doesn’t officially open until January 2nd but there are already some Husky players who have announced their intention to enter once available (or that intention has been reported by reputable sources). There won’t be any official offers to players until we hit January 2nd but we’ll include updates from Max Vrooman’s transfer portal rankings with every player in the portal with a tie to Washington in some way.\n\nHusky Players Expected to Enter the Transfer Portal (4)\n\nHarris was a three-star recruit out of powerhouse Bishop Gorman HS in Las Vegas, NV. He committed to Jedd Fisch at Arizona but transferred to Washington when Fisch took the job at UW. As a freshman, Harris played 72 offensive snaps across 9 games to burn his redshirt although nearly half of them were in the Sun Bowl. He finished with 2 catches for 17 yards.\n\nThis year it appeared Harris was passed on the depth chart by freshmen Raiden Vines-Bright, Dezmen Roebuck, and Chris Lawson. He played 5 games and was needed more heavily late in the year due to injuries at the receiver position. Harris’s highlight as a Husky was a 61-yard TD against Purdue.\n\nThank you Husky Nation for everything! It’s always love! 💜 https://t.co/Jvv34PVCWr\n\n— Audric Harris (@audricharris2) December 3, 2025\n\nBryant was a three-star recruit out of St. John Bosco in the class of 2023. Over his first two seasons at Washington he played 64 snaps as a reserve. Opportunity opened up for Bryant as Washington lost almost their entire linebacker corps from 2024 to eligibility or the portal. Bryant stepped up and surprisingly won a starting spot, starting the Huskies’ first 10 games this season.\n\nBut it was clear that the path to playing time would be harder next season with Jacob Manu and Zaydrius Rainey-Sale both back following 2024 ACL tears plus Buddah Al-Uqdah coming back from injury and Xe’ree Alexander playing well down the stretch. There was no way that there would be enough playing time for all 5 next season and so Bryant is the first of the group to depart as the only one of the group not initially signed by the current coaching staff.\n\nFYI: Husky LB Devin Bryant is not with the team in LA. Planning to enter the transfer portal. \n\nAlso, G Geirean Hatchett has been granted a waiver by the NCAA and is planning on returning to UW next year\n\n— Dave “Softy” Mahler (@Softykjr) December 14, 2025\n\nMcCutcheon was a three-star recruit in the class of 2021 having originally committed to Jimmy Lake as the slot corner in Lake’s defense. Lake of course was out by the end of McCutcheon’s freshman year but he stuck around under Kalen DeBoer playing 84 snaps over his 2nd and 3rd seasons in the program. McCutcheon once again stayed at UW when Jedd Fisch came in and in 2024 played 254 snaps as the backup nickel corner. He was seemingly passed on the depth chart by Rahshawn Clark in the preseason though and then suffered a season-ending injury in the first month of the year before playing a snap. He is hoping to earn a medical waiver for 2026 and otherwise would be out of eligibility so his departure doesn’t change UW’s expected scholarship count.\n\nNEW: Washington cornerback Dyson McCutcheon plans to enter the transfer portal, @PeteNakos reports. \n\nThe son of former NFL player Daylon McCutcheon missed the 2025 season but played in 12 games in 2024. He's seeking a sixth year of eligibility.https://t.co/kSYG7dYADj pic.twitter.com/NUWNgFnu3F\n\n— Transfer Portal (@TransferPortal) December 14, 2025\n\nBoyajyan was a three-star recruit out of Clovis, CA in the class of 2024. He signed with Washington as his only P4 offer with Washington looking to replenish an offensive line that had absolutely no depth when Jedd Fisch took over in Seattle. Boyayjyan hadn’t seen the field yet through two seasons and didn’t appear likely to be one of the top 8 linemen for next season barring a huge leap in the offseason.\n\nWashington OL Davit Boyajyan plans to enter the portal.\n\nBoyajyan signed with the Huskies in 2024 out of Clovis (Calif.) North- redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining. https://t.co/kUwKSzhG03 pic.twitter.com/44zbh4JQ1L\n\n— Brandon Huffman (@BrandonHuffman) December 14, 2025\n\nTransfer Portal Rankings Dashboard\n\nYou can access the dashboard here (the spacing is better than the embedded version here).",

This will be a sad game to watch with two teams that have five wins between them in Week 15, and they’ve already played each other once. Jayden Daniels won’t be available for the second matchup of the season, but Giants’ rookie QB Jaxson Dart will be out there trying to prove that he can last in the league.

    "fullText": "It was just one of those nights for the Washington Capitals (18-10-4). They put up one of their weaker performances and got crushed 5-1 by the Winnipeg Jets (15-15-1) on Saturday.\n\nFrom the get-go, the Capitals just couldn’t get much going, as they only totaled three shots in the first period.\n\nThe Capitals’ performance was so bad to the point where they trailed 5-0 in the third period. It took a 5-on-3 opportunity for the team to end the shutout, thanks to Jakob Chychrun.\n\nIt also didn’t help that defending Hart Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck made his return for Winnipeg after his injury.\n\nLogan Thompson did all he could as he stopped 30 of 35 shots, but wasn’t given much help from his teammates.\n\nWith this result, the Capitals’ nine-game point streak comes to an end. They will look to regroup as they visit the Minnesota Wild on Tuesday.\n\nComing off the previous game, it seemed like the Capitals’ offense had been sputtering. Saturday’s loss against Winnipeg wasn’t any better.\n\nThe Capitals got off to another slow start, as they were outshot by Winnipeg 13-3 and trailed 2-0 in the opening period.\n\nDefending Hart Trophy winner Hellebuyck made his return for Winnipeg after missing time due to knee surgery. He was too much for the Capitals as he stopped 24 of 25 shots.\n\nThe Capitals struggled on the 5-on-5 throughout the night, failing to generate much pressure or enter the zone cleanly. Carbery changed up the lines, with Brandon Duhaime and Nic Dowd reuniting, and Hendrix Lapierre moving up to 3C. Unfortunately, the new lines didn’t work.\n\nMultiple Capitals players finished below zero when it came to the plus-minus. However, Justin Sourdif registered the worst at -3.\n\nThe Capitals also struggled on special teams, failing to convert on their first three power-play opportunities. The team also gave up a Winnipeg goal on the penalty kill in the middle frame.\n\nThe Capitals finally got on the board late when Chychrun fired the puck past Hellebuyck on the 5-on-3.\n\nChychrun now has 12 goals on the season, while Alex Ovechkin’s assist moved him past Jaromir Jagr for 10th-most power-play points in NHL history.\n\nThis just wasn’t one of the better performances for the Capitals. The team couldn’t generate chances and was outplayed by Winnipeg.\n\nWhile the Capitals weren’t able to get going on the 5-on-5, the special teams didn’t help for the most part. The Capitals finally scored via Chychrun on the two-man advantage late in the game.\n\nThompson was put in a rough situation as he made 30 saves on the night. Though the five goals he gave up made all the difference (not his fault).\n\nThe 23-year-old made his NHL debut and was quite all right. Playing on the fourth line with Duhaime and Dowd, Trineyev tried to be physical and finished with 11:45 of ice time.\n\nJohn Cena Officially Retires: 6 Dream Matches We Never Got, Including Versus Goldberg\n\nSaturday Night’s Main Event Results: Highlights From John Cena Retirement Match & Grades\n\nCanadiens Highlights: Collapse At Madison Square Garden",

U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

    "fullText": "Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem was questioned about a Purple Heart veteran deported by ICE during a Dec. 11 hearing\n\nRep. Seth Magaziner brought the veteran, Sae Joon Park, to the hearing over Zoom after he was deported to Korea earlier this year\n\nMagaziner accused Noem of not knowing \"the difference between the good guys and the bad guys\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was challenged during a hearing today about her department's controversial deportation practices.\n\nNoem, 54, testified before the House on Thursday, Dec. 11, about national security threats, where she was questioned by a representative about the deportation of military veterans by the Trump administration.\n\n\"Madame Secretary, how many United States military veterans have you deported?\" Rep. Seth Magaziner, a Democrat from Rhode Island, asked Noem during the hearing.\n\nWhen she replied, \"Sir, we have not deported U.S. citizens or military veterans,\" Magaziner began to express his respect for military members as a man who had been sitting behind him stood and brought over a tablet featuring a veteran calling into the hearing over video.\n\n\"As Americans, we owe everything to those who have served our country in uniform, particularly those who have served in combat. Do you agree with that?\" Magaziner asked.\n\nNoem began to say, \"Sir, I believe that people that are in the United States that are citizens have legal status here—\" before Magaziner interrupted to introduce the video guest.\n\n\"Madame Secretary, we are joined on Zoom by a gentleman named Sae Joon Park,\" Magaziner said. \"He is a United States Army combat veteran who was shot twice while serving our country in Panama in 1989.\"\n\nMagaziner said Park — a Purple Heart recipient — had struggled with PTSD and substance abuse issues after his time in combat, and had been arrested in the '90s for \"minor drug offenses.\" NPR previously reported that Park was charged with possession of a controlled substance and bail jumping while battling an addiction to crack cocaine.\n\nPark has been sober for the last 14 years, the congressman told Noem, before saying, \"Earlier this year, you deported him to Korea, a country he hasn't lived in since he was 7 years old.\"\n\nMagaziner then asked Noem to join him in \"thanking Mr. Park for his service to our country.\"\n\nShe responded by saying she is \"grateful for every single person that has served our country and follows our laws, and knows that our laws are important and every one of them needs to be enforced.\"\n\nWhen he pressed her about looking into Park's case, Noem said she \"absolutely\" would, but added, \"Our programs need to have integrity, as well.\"\n\nMagaziner continued with his questioning when he introduced a Navy veteran named Jim Brown who is married to a woman who came to the U.S. from Ireland and has lived in the country for 48 years, but has been in prison for the last four months.\n\n\"She did not come here illegally, and she has never committed any crime other than writing two bad checks totaling $80 ten years ago,\" Magaziner said.\n\nNoem claimed it was not \"my prerogative, my latitude or my job to pick and choose which laws in this country get enforced,\" but Magaziner hit back by claiming she has \"broad discretion\" as DHS secretary. When asked, she said she would review the case of Brown's wife.\n\nThe congressman also introduced a veteran whose father, Narciso Barranco, had been targeted by immigration agents over the summer and punched in the the head. He asked Noem to consider offering parole to Barranco.\n\nMagaziner went on to criticize Noem, telling her, “There are many problems with your leadership, but the biggest problem is this: You don’t seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Go after the bad guys, go after the terrorists, do not go after veterans, Marines, children, United States citizens.”\n\nNoem allegedly left the hearing early, according to The Hill and The Washington Post, claiming she had to attend another meeting that had been canceled. Noem’s office told The Hill the secretary found out the meeting had been called off after leaving the witness table.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nNoem has come under fire during her tenure at DHS for her attention-grabbing deportation tactics. Earlier this month, she said on X that she had been discussing ramping up travel bans with President Donald Trump.\n\nNoem recommended a \"full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\"\n\nHer Dec. 1 post came not long after Trump, 79, said his administration planned to \"permanently pause\" migration from \"Third World Countries.\" He did not identify countries by name or clarify how he would implement the immigration pause.",

    "fullText": "Two key Cavs players ruled out vs. Wizards, but there’s a positive update appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers will not have Jarrett Allen and Sam Merrill for Friday’s road matchup against the Washington Wizards, extending their absences and leaving the wine and gold without those two key players for the fifth straight game. Despite the team ruling them out, however, both have made progress this week.\n\nAfter Thursday’s practice, Merrill was wearing a wrap partially on his right hand while going through a workout.\n\n“Really good news,” Cavs head coach Kenny Atkinson said, glancing over at Merrill dribbling against two of his assistant coaches. “[He’s] actually shooting with his shooting hand, which is a pleasant sight to see.”\n\nBefore that, Merrill hadn’t been able to do anything with his right hand, which has been swollen and sprained since a reach-in attempt on Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo in mid-November. There is nothing structurally wrong with it, but Cleveland’s swingman hadn’t been able to catch or shoot. At least now he’s showing the ability to do one of those things.\n\nAllen only participated in half of the Cavs’ latest practice and didn’t take full-on contact. Unfortunately, that is a downgrade from Tuesday afternoon’s session where he did everything. Allen has been dealing with two separate finger injuries on each hand, with his left ring finger fractured and his right third finger strained.\n\nIn addition to Merrill and Allen, Cleveland veteran forward Larry Nance Jr. was getting shots up after practice at the near court with a wrap on his right calf.\n\nAtkinson also spoke about Max Strus’ return status, which hasn’t changed from the three-to-four months the organization initially estimated as the recovery time post-surgery.\n\n“Just kind of no update in terms of, ‘Hey, it’s gonna be faster or slower,'” Atkinson said. “Same timeline. I think he’s in a good way in terms of his recovery.”\n\nStrus is making his way back from a Jones fracture in his left foot, while Merrill and Allen are inching closer to coming back to the floor.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 11 - Major automakers on Thursday urged Washington to prevent Chinese government-backed automakers and battery manufacturers from opening U.S. ​manufacturing plants, warning the industry's future is at stake.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive ‌Innovation, which represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Stellantis and other major automakers, sounded the ‌alarm and said Congress and the Trump administration needed to act.\n\n\"China poses a clear and present threat to the auto industry in the U.S.,\" the group wrote in a statement for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles. The group also said ⁠lawmakers should maintain the U.S. ‌Commerce Department's prohibition on importing information and communications technology and services from China that effectively bars the import of vehicles from ‍Chinese manufacturers.\n\n\"No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is ​a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent ‌from happening inside the U.S.,\" the auto industry group said.\n\nRepresentative John Moolenaar, a Republican who chairs a select House committee on China, said Congress should codify into law the prohibitions on Chinese-connected vehicles that were adopted in the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"In just five years, China has gone from a minor ⁠exporter to the world's largest auto exporter, shipping ​6 million vehicles abroad last year at below ​market prices that U.S. and allied automakers cannot match,\" Moolenaar said. \"With massive subsidies, control over raw materials and supply chains and a ‍predatory regulatory regime, Beijing ⁠has turned its auto industry into a tool of the state.\n\nHe also cited national security concerns about Chinese-imported vehicles and concerns that Beijing could ⁠disable vehicles with Chinese-made software or components in the event of a major confrontation.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in ‌Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
