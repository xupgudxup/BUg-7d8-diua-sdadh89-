    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The United States is using its economic power to “assert its will\" and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service, in its latest annual assessment, said Washington's greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\nPerhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a NATO and European Union member country, and a U.S. ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

Seth Magaziner brought the veteran, Sae Joon Park, to the hearing over Zoom after he was deported to Korea earlier this year\n\nMagaziner accused Noem of not knowing \"the difference between the good guys and the bad guys\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was challenged during a hearing today about her department's controversial deportation practices.\n\nNoem, 54, testified before the House on Thursday, Dec. 11, about national security threats, where she was questioned by a representative about the deportation of military veterans by the Trump administration.\n\n\"Madame Secretary, how many United States military veterans have you deported?\" Rep. Seth Magaziner, a Democrat from Rhode Island, asked Noem during the hearing.\n\nWhen she replied, \"Sir, we have not deported U.S. citizens or military veterans,\" Magaziner began to express his respect for military members as a man who had been sitting behind him stood and brought over a tablet featuring a veteran calling into the hearing over video.\n\n\"As Americans, we owe everything to those who have served our country in uniform, particularly those who have served in combat. Do you agree with that?\" Magaziner asked.\n\nNoem began to say, \"Sir, I believe that people that are in the United States that are citizens have legal status here—\" before Magaziner interrupted to introduce the video guest.\n\n\"Madame Secretary, we are joined on Zoom by a gentleman named Sae Joon Park,\" Magaziner said. \"He is a United States Army combat veteran who was shot twice while serving our country in Panama in 1989.\"\n\nMagaziner said Park — a Purple Heart recipient — had struggled with PTSD and substance abuse issues after his time in combat, and had been arrested in the '90s for \"minor drug offenses.\" NPR previously reported that Park was charged with possession of a controlled substance and bail jumping while battling an addiction to crack cocaine.\n\nPark has been sober for the last 14 years, the congressman told Noem, before saying, \"Earlier this year, you deported him to Korea, a country he hasn't lived in since he was 7 years old.\"\n\nMagaziner then asked Noem to join him in \"thanking Mr. Park for his service to our country.\"\n\nShe responded by saying she is \"grateful for every single person that has served our country and follows our laws, and knows that our laws are important and every one of them needs to be enforced.\"\n\nWhen he pressed her about looking into Park's case, Noem said she \"absolutely\" would, but added, \"Our programs need to have integrity, as well.\"\n\nMagaziner continued with his questioning when he introduced a Navy veteran named Jim Brown who is married to a woman who came to the U.S. from Ireland and has lived in the country for 48 years, but has been in prison for the last four months.\n\n\"She did not come here illegally, and she has never committed any crime other than writing two bad checks totaling $80 ten years ago,\" Magaziner said.\n\nNoem claimed it was not \"my prerogative, my latitude or my job to pick and choose which laws in this country get enforced,\" but Magaziner hit back by claiming she has \"broad discretion\" as DHS secretary. When asked, she said she would review the case of Brown's wife.\n\nThe congressman also introduced a veteran whose father, Narciso Barranco, had been targeted by immigration agents over the summer and punched in the the head. He asked Noem to consider offering parole to Barranco.\n\nMagaziner went on to criticize Noem, telling her, “There are many problems with your leadership, but the biggest problem is this: You don’t seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Go after the bad guys, go after the terrorists, do not go after veterans, Marines, children, United States citizens.”\n\nNoem allegedly left the hearing early, according to The Hill and The Washington Post, claiming she had to attend another meeting that had been canceled. Noem’s office told The Hill the secretary found out the meeting had been called off after leaving the witness table.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nNoem has come under fire during her tenure at DHS for her attention-grabbing deportation tactics. Earlier this month, she said on X that she had been discussing ramping up travel bans with President Donald Trump.\n\nNoem recommended a \"full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\"\n\nHer Dec. 1 post came not long after Trump, 79, said his administration planned to \"permanently pause\" migration from \"Third World Countries.\" He did not identify countries by name or clarify how he would implement the immigration pause.",

    "fullText": "Two key Cavs players ruled out vs. Wizards, but there’s a positive update appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers will not have Jarrett Allen and Sam Merrill for Friday’s road matchup against the Washington Wizards, extending their absences and leaving the wine and gold without those two key players for the fifth straight game. Despite the team ruling them out, however, both have made progress this week.\n\nAfter Thursday’s practice, Merrill was wearing a wrap partially on his right hand while going through a workout.\n\n“Really good news,” Cavs head coach Kenny Atkinson said, glancing over at Merrill dribbling against two of his assistant coaches. “[He’s] actually shooting with his shooting hand, which is a pleasant sight to see.”\n\nBefore that, Merrill hadn’t been able to do anything with his right hand, which has been swollen and sprained since a reach-in attempt on Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo in mid-November. There is nothing structurally wrong with it, but Cleveland’s swingman hadn’t been able to catch or shoot. At least now he’s showing the ability to do one of those things.\n\nAllen only participated in half of the Cavs’ latest practice and didn’t take full-on contact. Unfortunately, that is a downgrade from Tuesday afternoon’s session where he did everything. Allen has been dealing with two separate finger injuries on each hand, with his left ring finger fractured and his right third finger strained.\n\nIn addition to Merrill and Allen, Cleveland veteran forward Larry Nance Jr. was getting shots up after practice at the near court with a wrap on his right calf.\n\nAtkinson also spoke about Max Strus’ return status, which hasn’t changed from the three-to-four months the organization initially estimated as the recovery time post-surgery.\n\n“Just kind of no update in terms of, ‘Hey, it’s gonna be faster or slower,'” Atkinson said. “Same timeline. I think he’s in a good way in terms of his recovery.”\n\nStrus is making his way back from a Jones fracture in his left foot, while Merrill and Allen are inching closer to coming back to the floor.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 11 - Major automakers on Thursday urged Washington to prevent Chinese government-backed automakers and battery manufacturers from opening U.S. ​manufacturing plants, warning the industry's future is at stake.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive ‌Innovation, which represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Stellantis and other major automakers, sounded the ‌alarm and said Congress and the Trump administration needed to act.\n\n\"China poses a clear and present threat to the auto industry in the U.S.,\" the group wrote in a statement for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles. The group also said ⁠lawmakers should maintain the U.S. ‌Commerce Department's prohibition on importing information and communications technology and services from China that effectively bars the import of vehicles from ‍Chinese manufacturers.\n\n\"No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is ​a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent ‌from happening inside the U.S.,\" the auto industry group said.\n\nRepresentative John Moolenaar, a Republican who chairs a select House committee on China, said Congress should codify into law the prohibitions on Chinese-connected vehicles that were adopted in the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"In just five years, China has gone from a minor ⁠exporter to the world's largest auto exporter, shipping ​6 million vehicles abroad last year at below ​market prices that U.S. and allied automakers cannot match,\" Moolenaar said. \"With massive subsidies, control over raw materials and supply chains and a ‍predatory regulatory regime, Beijing ⁠has turned its auto industry into a tool of the state.\n\nHe also cited national security concerns about Chinese-imported vehicles and concerns that Beijing could ⁠disable vehicles with Chinese-made software or components in the event of a major confrontation.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in ‌Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
