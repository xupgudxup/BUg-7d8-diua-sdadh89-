    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders finally got something to be happy about in Week 15. The team broke an eight-game losing streak by taking down the New York Giants.\n\nThere won't be any playoff games for the Commanders this year, but ending on a positive note and going into the offseason with positive momentum is important. The team will have to go the rest of the season without star quarterback Jayden Daniels, but Marcus Mariota has been serviceable in his place.\n\nOn Tuesday, the team announced a series of roster moves:\n\n- Placed WR Noah Brown on the Reserve/Injured List- Designated CB Darius Rush practice squad injured- Signed WR Chris Moore from the practice squad- Signed WR River Cracraft and TE Gee Scott Jr. to the practice squad\n\nWe have made the following roster moves:\n- Placed WR Noah Brown on the Reserve/Injured List\n- Designated CB Darius Rush practice squad injured\n- Signed WR Chris Moore from the practice squad\n- Signed WR River Cracraft and TE Gee Scott Jr. to the practice squad\n\n— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) December 16, 2025\n\nIt's disappointing to see Brown go back on the injured list. The receiver will end his season having only played in four games. Replacing Brown will be an old friend, Chris Moore, who is being promoted from the practice squad. Moore spent most of the season on the roster, but was released to make room for Brown and then re-signed to the practice squad.\n\nWide receiver River Cracraft will take Moore's practice squad spot, and tight end Gee Scott Jr. was also added to the practice squad. Cracraft will be on his second stint with Washington's practice squad this season.\n\nOver the last few weeks, some players could get a chance to impress and prove they belong in the league. The team has two games against the Philadelphia Eagles and one against the Dallas Cowboys remaining.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Announce roster moves ahead of Week 16",

    "fullText": "Pledge to invest billions in UK paused, with Washington citing lack of progress on trade barriers across pond\n\nThe US has paused its promised multi-billion-pound investment into British tech over trade disagreements, marking a serious setback in US-UK relations.\n\nThe £31bn “tech prosperity deal”, hailed by Keir Starmer as “a generational stepchange in our relationship with the US” when it was announced during Donald Trump’s state visit, has been put on ice by Washington.\n\nAs part of the deal, US tech companies pledged to spend billions in the UK, including a £22bn investment from Microsoft and £5bn from Google. But Washington has paused the implementation of the agreement, citing a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.\n\nBritish officials sought to downplay the development, which was first reported by the New York Times. The newspaper said Trump’s administration was unhappy about the UK continuing to levy a digital services tax on American tech companies and its food safety rules, which bar the export of certain agricultural products.\n\nOne British government source said it was “the usual bit of hardball negotiations by the Americans” and said that the deal to allow tariff-free British pharmaceutical exports to the US was on and off before it was finalised.\n\n“[The US commerce secretary] Howard Lutnick is a tough guy. We understand that the Americans negotiate incredibly hard but we’ll stand our ground. They want what’s best for their country, we want what’s best for ours,” the source said.\n\nA second government source said the development was “part of the shape of the negotiations” with Washington.\n\nThe prosperity deal included the creation of an artificial intelligence “growth zone” in the north-east of England, which UK officials said could bring in up to £30bn and create 5,000 jobs.\n\nBut the text of the agreement stated that it only “becomes operative alongside substantive progress being made to formalise and implement” it.\n\nThe decision to put it on hold is a blow to the UK government, which touted the agreement as a prize of its intensive year-long engagement with the US to avoid punitive tariffs on British exports. As part of his diplomatic charm offensive, Starmer hosted Trump for a second state visit at Windsor Castle in September, an unprecedented honour for a US president.\n\nStarmer has resisted US pressure to scrap or amend the digital services tax, a 2% levy on the revenues of tech companies including Amazon, Google and Apple that raises about £800m a year. Trump has repeatedly threatened to retaliate against countries with digital taxes, including the UK.\n\nThe Guardian revealed that during trade negotiations in the spring, the government drew up proposals to reduce the amount paid by US tech companies and by applying the tax to a wider range of companies without reducing its total take. But so far the tax has remained unchanged.\n\nThe US has also exerted pressure over the UK’s online safety rules, with officials promising to review their enforcement during the talks.\n\nA third area of contention has been the UK’s food safety regime, with ministers admitting that the US has raised objections to it. As part of the trade deal the government agreed to lower tariffs on some US agricultural products including beef, but it has stood by its manifesto commitment not to water down farming standards.\n\nAny decision to weaken these could open the door to American chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef being sold in Britain, a prospect that has long been highly controversial with farmers and consumer groups.\n\nAt a press conference at Chequers in September, where he unveiled the tech prosperity deal, Starmer said it had “the power to change lives” and “renewed the special relationship for a new era”.\n\n“It’s our chance to ensure that technologies like AI, quantum and others amplify human potential, solve problems, cure diseases, make us richer and freer, strengthen democracy not tyranny,” the prime minister said. “This is the territory on which the future will be won.”\n\nTrump at the time said the deal would help the US and UK “dominate” in the world of artificial intelligence and “ensure our countries lead the next great technological revolution side by side”.\n\nPeter Kyle, the business and trade secretary, was in the US last week for negotiations with Lutnick, the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, and the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Their discussions touched on whisky and steel tariffs and collaboration on critical minerals. Kyle’s department said talks were due to continue in January.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the tech prosperity deal delivers opportunity for hard-working people in both countries.”\n\nThe Guardian reported at the weekend that Starmer was poised to choose his new ambassador to Washington after interviewing the three finalists last week. The three shortlisted candidates are the prime minister’s business adviser, Varun Chandra, who was central to negotiating the prosperity deal; Christian Turner, the incoming ambassador to the UN; and Nigel Casey, the ambassador to Russia.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has revealed the White House’s domestic priority, and it’s not bringing down costs or addressing the looming healthcare crisis.\n\nSpeaking at a holiday party on Sunday, the president described his aspirations for a triumphal arch in Washington, D.C., as White House Domestic Policy Council head Vince Haley’s “primary thing.”\n\n“It’s something that is so special. Uh, it will be like the one in, in Paris, but to be honest with you, it blows it away. Blows it away in every way,” Trump said. “And Vince came in one day and his eyes were teeming. I mean, he couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. He saw it and he wanted to do that. That’s your primary thing.”\n\nHaley previously served as a speechwriter for Trump and as a longtime aide for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n\n“Vince is unbelievable on policy. And we have a policy thing that’s going to be unbelievable happening,” he said of the proposed arch.\n\nTrump has spent months attempting to remake D.C. in his MAGAfied image, including paving over the White House Rose Garden, demolishing the East Wing, breaking ground on a $300 million ballroom, and announcing plans for other new construction around the nation’s capital—none of which has undergone the necessary legal reviews.\n\nIn October, he announced he wanted to build a knock-off of the Arc de Triomphe that would rival the Lincoln Memorial in scale. Sources say Trump has been presented with three different designs, but unsurprisingly he is reportedly most excited about a $100 million white-and-gold monstrosity.\n\n“We’re building an arc, like the Arc de Triomphe, and we’re building it, uh, by the Arlington Bridge, the Arlington Cemetery, uh, opposite the Lincoln Memorial. You could say Jefferson, Washington, everything, ’cause they’re all right there,” Trump described the project on Sunday.\n\nThe president has solicited private donations for the project, which would ostensibly commemorate the 250th anniversary of the United States, and has doubled down on the idea even as his approval ratings have cratered over his administration’s failure to rein in the cost of living.\n\nThe president’s own voters increasingly blame him for high prices, and last week, Trump launched a national tour to try to convince voters his economic policies are working—despite the fact that many Americans are cutting back on buying gifts this holiday season.\n\nThen there’s the fact that Republicans still don’t have a plan for bringing down healthcare costs after the latest GOP spending bill cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending and failed to extend health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHealthcare premiums for about 22 million Americans will skyrocket next year after the ACA credits expire, with the average recipient seeing their premiums double.\n\nBut to Trump, the more pressing issue is apparently that Washington is “the only city in the world that’s of great importance that doesn’t have a triumphal arch,” he said Sunday.\n\n“This one is gonna blow ‘em all away. The one that people know mostly is the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France. And, uh, we’re gonna top it by I think a lot,” he said.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.",
    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.\n\nThe officials said talks with President Donald Trump’s envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, led to narrowing differences on security guarantees that Kyiv said must be provided, as well as on Moscow’s demand that Ukraine concede land in the Donbas region in the country’s east.\n\nTrump dialed into a dinner Monday evening with negotiators and European leaders, and more talks are expected this weekend in Miami or elsewhere in the United States, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly by the White House.\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump told reporters at an unrelated White House event. He added, “We’re having tremendous support from European leaders. They want to get it ended, also.\"\n\nThe U.S. officials said the offer of security guarantees won’t be on the table “forever.” They said the Trump administration plans to put forward the agreement on guarantees for Senate approval, although they didn’t specify whether it would be ratified like a treaty, which needs the chamber's two-thirds approval.\n\nIn a statement, European leaders in Berlin said they and the U.S. committed to work together to provide “robust security guarantees,” including a European-led ”multinational force Ukraine\" supported by the U.S.\n\nThey said the force's work would include \"operating inside Ukraine\" as well as assisting in rebuilding Ukraine's forces, securing its skies and supporting safer seas. They said Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.\n\nWitkoff and Kushner were accompanied by U.S. Air Force Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who heads NATO's military operations and the U.S. European Command, as talks honed in on the particulars of what the U.S. officials described as an “Article 5-like” security agreement. Article Five in the NATO treaty is the collective defense clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all.\n\nThe U.S. side presented the Ukrainians a document that spelled out in greater specificity aspects of the proposed U.S. security guarantees — something that Ukrainian officials said was missing from earlier iterations of the U.S. peace proposal, according to U.S. officials.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it a “truly far-reaching, substantial agreement that we did not have before, namely that both Europe and the U.S. are jointly prepared to do this.”\n\nQuestions over Ukraine's postwar security and the fate of occupied territories have been the main obstacles in talks. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil.\n\nZelenskyy on Monday called the talks “substantial” and noted that differences remain on the issue of territory.\n\nZelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine’s preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.\n\nUkraine has continued to reject the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control as a key condition for peace.\n\nThe U.S. officials on Monday said there is consensus on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan, and that Russia has indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the European Union, something it previously said it did not object to.\n\nThe Russian president has cast Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, however, as a major threat to Moscow’s security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nAsked whether the negotiations could be over by Christmas, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said trying to predict a potential time frame for a peace deal was a “thankless task.”\n\n“I can only speak for the Russian side, for President Putin,” Peskov said. “He is open to peace, to a serious peace and serious decisions. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.”\n\nPutin has denied plans to attack any European allies.\n\nRussia fired 153 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said 133 drones were neutralized, while 17 more hit their targets.\n\nIn Russia, the Defense Ministry on Monday said forces destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones overnight. An additional 16 drones were destroyed between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time.\n\nEighteen drones were shot down over Moscow itself, the defense ministry said. Flights were temporarily halted at the city’s Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports as part of safety measures, officials said.\n\nDamage details and casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington. Seung Min Kim and Darlene Superville in Washington; Pietro De Cristofaro in Berlin; Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine; and Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed to this report.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",

    "fullText": "A United Airlines flight bound for Tokyo was forced to return to Washington Dulles International Airport on Saturday after losing power in one of its engines shortly after takeoff, triggering a brush fire on the ground and prompting a federal investigation. The Boeing 777-200 was carrying 275 passengers when the incident occurred, according to the airline.\n\nUnited Flight 803 departed Dulles around 12:35 p.m. en route to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. After the engine issue was detected, the aircraft circled the area for just under an hour before landing safely back at Dulles. United said there were eight crew members aboard and no injuries were reported.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a post on X that a piece of the jet’s engine cover broke off after takeoff, sparking a brush fire near the runway. He added that the Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident.\n\nI've been briefed on United Flight 803 from Dulles to Japan. \n\nHere’s what we know:\n -An engine failed on the Boeing 777-200ER shortly after take-off\n -275 passengers, 15 crew members on board\n -A piece of the engine cover separated and caught fire, sparking a brush fire on… https://t.co/IxkFJU2Fes\n\n— Secretary Sean Duffy (@SecDuffy) December 13, 2025\n\nEmily McGee, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, said the fire was quickly extinguished and that airport fire and rescue crews evaluated the aircraft after it returned. Smoke from the brush fire was visible across the tarmac as other flights continued arriving and departing.\n\nThe incident briefly disrupted operations at Dulles and drew the attention of passengers across the airport.\n\nHouman David Hemmati, a California-based ophthalmologist, was seated on a separate United flight bound for Los Angeles when his pilot announced a ground stop.\n\n“We are on a ground stop,” the pilot told passengers, Hemmati said. “There’s an incident on the runway.”\n\nLooking out his window, Hemmati said he saw thick smoke rising near the runway, illuminated by flashing emergency vehicles. He took photos and posted on X, writing, “Praying it’s not a crash.”\n\nHemmati’s flight was later diverted to another runway and allowed to depart around 1 p.m. As the plane climbed, he said smoke was still visible below.\n\nCommercial aircraft are designed to fly safely on a single engine, particularly during critical phases like takeoff. Pilots train extensively for engine failures, and standard protocol typically calls for returning to the departure airport when a problem occurs shortly after liftoff.\n\nKey details from the incident include:\n\nFlight: United Airlines Flight 803\n\nPassengers: 275 passengers and eight crew members\n\nIssue: Loss of power in one engine after takeoff\n\nGround impact: Engine cover debris sparked a brush fire\n\nOutcome: Safe return to Dulles with no reported injuries\n\nNext step: FAA investigation underway\n\nUnited praised the response of its crews and airport personnel in a statement released Saturday.\n\n“United is grateful to our crews and to the teams at Washington Dulles for their quick work to help ensure the safety of everyone involved,” the airline said. United added that it is working to rebook passengers on a later flight.\n\nThe FAA has not released details on what caused the engine cover to detach or whether the aircraft had any prior maintenance issues. Investigators are expected to examine flight data, maintenance records, and debris from the engine as part of the inquiry.\n\nThe Boeing 777 remains one of the most widely used wide-body aircraft in international travel, but any engine-related issue shortly after takeoff draws immediate scrutiny from regulators.\n\nFor passengers aboard Flight 803, the incident ended without injury but with a tense delay to an already long journey. For United and federal investigators, the focus now turns to determining what failed and whether any broader inspections are needed.\n\nThe FAA’s findings will ultimately determine whether the incident was an isolated mechanical failure or part of a larger concern.",

    "description": "Tracking every incoming and outgoing player from Washington in the transfer portal this cycle",
    "fullText": "This is your place to keep track of everything Husky related in the transfer portal this season. The portal still doesn’t officially open until January 2nd but there are already some Husky players who have announced their intention to enter once available (or that intention has been reported by reputable sources). There won’t be any official offers to players until we hit January 2nd but we’ll include updates from Max Vrooman’s transfer portal rankings with every player in the portal with a tie to Washington in some way.\n\nHusky Players Expected to Enter the Transfer Portal (4)\n\nHarris was a three-star recruit out of powerhouse Bishop Gorman HS in Las Vegas, NV. He committed to Jedd Fisch at Arizona but transferred to Washington when Fisch took the job at UW. As a freshman, Harris played 72 offensive snaps across 9 games to burn his redshirt although nearly half of them were in the Sun Bowl. He finished with 2 catches for 17 yards.\n\nThis year it appeared Harris was passed on the depth chart by freshmen Raiden Vines-Bright, Dezmen Roebuck, and Chris Lawson. He played 5 games and was needed more heavily late in the year due to injuries at the receiver position. Harris’s highlight as a Husky was a 61-yard TD against Purdue.\n\nThank you Husky Nation for everything! It’s always love! 💜 https://t.co/Jvv34PVCWr\n\n— Audric Harris (@audricharris2) December 3, 2025\n\nBryant was a three-star recruit out of St. John Bosco in the class of 2023. Over his first two seasons at Washington he played 64 snaps as a reserve. Opportunity opened up for Bryant as Washington lost almost their entire linebacker corps from 2024 to eligibility or the portal. Bryant stepped up and surprisingly won a starting spot, starting the Huskies’ first 10 games this season.\n\nBut it was clear that the path to playing time would be harder next season with Jacob Manu and Zaydrius Rainey-Sale both back following 2024 ACL tears plus Buddah Al-Uqdah coming back from injury and Xe’ree Alexander playing well down the stretch. There was no way that there would be enough playing time for all 5 next season and so Bryant is the first of the group to depart as the only one of the group not initially signed by the current coaching staff.\n\nFYI: Husky LB Devin Bryant is not with the team in LA. Planning to enter the transfer portal. \n\nAlso, G Geirean Hatchett has been granted a waiver by the NCAA and is planning on returning to UW next year\n\n— Dave “Softy” Mahler (@Softykjr) December 14, 2025\n\nMcCutcheon was a three-star recruit in the class of 2021 having originally committed to Jimmy Lake as the slot corner in Lake’s defense. Lake of course was out by the end of McCutcheon’s freshman year but he stuck around under Kalen DeBoer playing 84 snaps over his 2nd and 3rd seasons in the program. McCutcheon once again stayed at UW when Jedd Fisch came in and in 2024 played 254 snaps as the backup nickel corner. He was seemingly passed on the depth chart by Rahshawn Clark in the preseason though and then suffered a season-ending injury in the first month of the year before playing a snap. He is hoping to earn a medical waiver for 2026 and otherwise would be out of eligibility so his departure doesn’t change UW’s expected scholarship count.\n\nNEW: Washington cornerback Dyson McCutcheon plans to enter the transfer portal, @PeteNakos reports. \n\nThe son of former NFL player Daylon McCutcheon missed the 2025 season but played in 12 games in 2024. He's seeking a sixth year of eligibility.https://t.co/kSYG7dYADj pic.twitter.com/NUWNgFnu3F\n\n— Transfer Portal (@TransferPortal) December 14, 2025\n\nBoyajyan was a three-star recruit out of Clovis, CA in the class of 2024. He signed with Washington as his only P4 offer with Washington looking to replenish an offensive line that had absolutely no depth when Jedd Fisch took over in Seattle. Boyayjyan hadn’t seen the field yet through two seasons and didn’t appear likely to be one of the top 8 linemen for next season barring a huge leap in the offseason.\n\nWashington OL Davit Boyajyan plans to enter the portal.\n\nBoyajyan signed with the Huskies in 2024 out of Clovis (Calif.) North- redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining. https://t.co/kUwKSzhG03 pic.twitter.com/44zbh4JQ1L\n\n— Brandon Huffman (@BrandonHuffman) December 14, 2025\n\nTransfer Portal Rankings Dashboard\n\nYou can access the dashboard here (the spacing is better than the embedded version here).",

    "fullText": "It was just one of those nights for the Washington Capitals (18-10-4). They put up one of their weaker performances and got crushed 5-1 by the Winnipeg Jets (15-15-1) on Saturday.\n\nFrom the get-go, the Capitals just couldn’t get much going, as they only totaled three shots in the first period.\n\nThe Capitals’ performance was so bad to the point where they trailed 5-0 in the third period. It took a 5-on-3 opportunity for the team to end the shutout, thanks to Jakob Chychrun.\n\nIt also didn’t help that defending Hart Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck made his return for Winnipeg after his injury.\n\nLogan Thompson did all he could as he stopped 30 of 35 shots, but wasn’t given much help from his teammates.\n\nWith this result, the Capitals’ nine-game point streak comes to an end. They will look to regroup as they visit the Minnesota Wild on Tuesday.\n\nComing off the previous game, it seemed like the Capitals’ offense had been sputtering. Saturday’s loss against Winnipeg wasn’t any better.\n\nThe Capitals got off to another slow start, as they were outshot by Winnipeg 13-3 and trailed 2-0 in the opening period.\n\nDefending Hart Trophy winner Hellebuyck made his return for Winnipeg after missing time due to knee surgery. He was too much for the Capitals as he stopped 24 of 25 shots.\n\nThe Capitals struggled on the 5-on-5 throughout the night, failing to generate much pressure or enter the zone cleanly. Carbery changed up the lines, with Brandon Duhaime and Nic Dowd reuniting, and Hendrix Lapierre moving up to 3C. Unfortunately, the new lines didn’t work.\n\nMultiple Capitals players finished below zero when it came to the plus-minus. However, Justin Sourdif registered the worst at -3.\n\nThe Capitals also struggled on special teams, failing to convert on their first three power-play opportunities. The team also gave up a Winnipeg goal on the penalty kill in the middle frame.\n\nThe Capitals finally got on the board late when Chychrun fired the puck past Hellebuyck on the 5-on-3.\n\nChychrun now has 12 goals on the season, while Alex Ovechkin’s assist moved him past Jaromir Jagr for 10th-most power-play points in NHL history.\n\nThis just wasn’t one of the better performances for the Capitals. The team couldn’t generate chances and was outplayed by Winnipeg.\n\nWhile the Capitals weren’t able to get going on the 5-on-5, the special teams didn’t help for the most part. The Capitals finally scored via Chychrun on the two-man advantage late in the game.\n\nThompson was put in a rough situation as he made 30 saves on the night. Though the five goals he gave up made all the difference (not his fault).\n\nThe 23-year-old made his NHL debut and was quite all right. Playing on the fourth line with Duhaime and Dowd, Trineyev tried to be physical and finished with 11:45 of ice time.\n\nJohn Cena Officially Retires: 6 Dream Matches We Never Got, Including Versus Goldberg\n\nSaturday Night’s Main Event Results: Highlights From John Cena Retirement Match & Grades\n\nCanadiens Highlights: Collapse At Madison Square Garden",

    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The United States is using its economic power to “assert its will\" and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service, in its latest annual assessment, said Washington's greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\nPerhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a NATO and European Union member country, and a U.S. ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

Seth Magaziner brought the veteran, Sae Joon Park, to the hearing over Zoom after he was deported to Korea earlier this year\n\nMagaziner accused Noem of not knowing \"the difference between the good guys and the bad guys\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was challenged during a hearing today about her department's controversial deportation practices.\n\nNoem, 54, testified before the House on Thursday, Dec. 11, about national security threats, where she was questioned by a representative about the deportation of military veterans by the Trump administration.\n\n\"Madame Secretary, how many United States military veterans have you deported?\" Rep. Seth Magaziner, a Democrat from Rhode Island, asked Noem during the hearing.\n\nWhen she replied, \"Sir, we have not deported U.S. citizens or military veterans,\" Magaziner began to express his respect for military members as a man who had been sitting behind him stood and brought over a tablet featuring a veteran calling into the hearing over video.\n\n\"As Americans, we owe everything to those who have served our country in uniform, particularly those who have served in combat. Do you agree with that?\" Magaziner asked.\n\nNoem began to say, \"Sir, I believe that people that are in the United States that are citizens have legal status here—\" before Magaziner interrupted to introduce the video guest.\n\n\"Madame Secretary, we are joined on Zoom by a gentleman named Sae Joon Park,\" Magaziner said. \"He is a United States Army combat veteran who was shot twice while serving our country in Panama in 1989.\"\n\nMagaziner said Park — a Purple Heart recipient — had struggled with PTSD and substance abuse issues after his time in combat, and had been arrested in the '90s for \"minor drug offenses.\" NPR previously reported that Park was charged with possession of a controlled substance and bail jumping while battling an addiction to crack cocaine.\n\nPark has been sober for the last 14 years, the congressman told Noem, before saying, \"Earlier this year, you deported him to Korea, a country he hasn't lived in since he was 7 years old.\"\n\nMagaziner then asked Noem to join him in \"thanking Mr. Park for his service to our country.\"\n\nShe responded by saying she is \"grateful for every single person that has served our country and follows our laws, and knows that our laws are important and every one of them needs to be enforced.\"\n\nWhen he pressed her about looking into Park's case, Noem said she \"absolutely\" would, but added, \"Our programs need to have integrity, as well.\"\n\nMagaziner continued with his questioning when he introduced a Navy veteran named Jim Brown who is married to a woman who came to the U.S. from Ireland and has lived in the country for 48 years, but has been in prison for the last four months.\n\n\"She did not come here illegally, and she has never committed any crime other than writing two bad checks totaling $80 ten years ago,\" Magaziner said.\n\nNoem claimed it was not \"my prerogative, my latitude or my job to pick and choose which laws in this country get enforced,\" but Magaziner hit back by claiming she has \"broad discretion\" as DHS secretary. When asked, she said she would review the case of Brown's wife.\n\nThe congressman also introduced a veteran whose father, Narciso Barranco, had been targeted by immigration agents over the summer and punched in the the head. He asked Noem to consider offering parole to Barranco.\n\nMagaziner went on to criticize Noem, telling her, “There are many problems with your leadership, but the biggest problem is this: You don’t seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Go after the bad guys, go after the terrorists, do not go after veterans, Marines, children, United States citizens.”\n\nNoem allegedly left the hearing early, according to The Hill and The Washington Post, claiming she had to attend another meeting that had been canceled. Noem’s office told The Hill the secretary found out the meeting had been called off after leaving the witness table.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nNoem has come under fire during her tenure at DHS for her attention-grabbing deportation tactics. Earlier this month, she said on X that she had been discussing ramping up travel bans with President Donald Trump.\n\nNoem recommended a \"full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\"\n\nHer Dec. 1 post came not long after Trump, 79, said his administration planned to \"permanently pause\" migration from \"Third World Countries.\" He did not identify countries by name or clarify how he would implement the immigration pause.",

    "fullText": "Two key Cavs players ruled out vs. Wizards, but there’s a positive update appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers will not have Jarrett Allen and Sam Merrill for Friday’s road matchup against the Washington Wizards, extending their absences and leaving the wine and gold without those two key players for the fifth straight game. Despite the team ruling them out, however, both have made progress this week.\n\nAfter Thursday’s practice, Merrill was wearing a wrap partially on his right hand while going through a workout.\n\n“Really good news,” Cavs head coach Kenny Atkinson said, glancing over at Merrill dribbling against two of his assistant coaches. “[He’s] actually shooting with his shooting hand, which is a pleasant sight to see.”\n\nBefore that, Merrill hadn’t been able to do anything with his right hand, which has been swollen and sprained since a reach-in attempt on Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo in mid-November. There is nothing structurally wrong with it, but Cleveland’s swingman hadn’t been able to catch or shoot. At least now he’s showing the ability to do one of those things.\n\nAllen only participated in half of the Cavs’ latest practice and didn’t take full-on contact. Unfortunately, that is a downgrade from Tuesday afternoon’s session where he did everything. Allen has been dealing with two separate finger injuries on each hand, with his left ring finger fractured and his right third finger strained.\n\nIn addition to Merrill and Allen, Cleveland veteran forward Larry Nance Jr. was getting shots up after practice at the near court with a wrap on his right calf.\n\nAtkinson also spoke about Max Strus’ return status, which hasn’t changed from the three-to-four months the organization initially estimated as the recovery time post-surgery.\n\n“Just kind of no update in terms of, ‘Hey, it’s gonna be faster or slower,'” Atkinson said. “Same timeline. I think he’s in a good way in terms of his recovery.”\n\nStrus is making his way back from a Jones fracture in his left foot, while Merrill and Allen are inching closer to coming back to the floor.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 11 - Major automakers on Thursday urged Washington to prevent Chinese government-backed automakers and battery manufacturers from opening U.S. ​manufacturing plants, warning the industry's future is at stake.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive ‌Innovation, which represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Stellantis and other major automakers, sounded the ‌alarm and said Congress and the Trump administration needed to act.\n\n\"China poses a clear and present threat to the auto industry in the U.S.,\" the group wrote in a statement for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles. The group also said ⁠lawmakers should maintain the U.S. ‌Commerce Department's prohibition on importing information and communications technology and services from China that effectively bars the import of vehicles from ‍Chinese manufacturers.\n\n\"No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is ​a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent ‌from happening inside the U.S.,\" the auto industry group said.\n\nRepresentative John Moolenaar, a Republican who chairs a select House committee on China, said Congress should codify into law the prohibitions on Chinese-connected vehicles that were adopted in the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"In just five years, China has gone from a minor ⁠exporter to the world's largest auto exporter, shipping ​6 million vehicles abroad last year at below ​market prices that U.S. and allied automakers cannot match,\" Moolenaar said. \"With massive subsidies, control over raw materials and supply chains and a ‍predatory regulatory regime, Beijing ⁠has turned its auto industry into a tool of the state.\n\nHe also cited national security concerns about Chinese-imported vehicles and concerns that Beijing could ⁠disable vehicles with Chinese-made software or components in the event of a major confrontation.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in ‌Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
