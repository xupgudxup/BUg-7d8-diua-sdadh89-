    "fullText": "The Jacksonville Jaguars will play two home games in London during the 2026 NFL season, while the Washington Commanders will host the other London game.\n\nThe announcement comes a day after the Detroit Lions were confirmed as the host team for the NFL's return to Munich next season.\n\nThe NFL's sixth regular-season game in Germany will be particularly poignant for Detroit's wide receiver Amon-Ra St Brown and his family.\n\nThe 26-year-old's mother Miriam is German and he and his two brothers speak the language fluently. They have visited Germany often and it was Miriam who broke the news to her youngest son, external that his team will play at Allianz Arena.\n\n\"It has been a dream of mine to play a game in my mother's home country,\" said Amon-Ra. \"I cannot wait to play in front of the incredible fans that I've gotten to know through my visits and football camps.\"\n\nThe dates and the opponents for the games will be confirmed during the NFL's full schedule release in May.\n\nThey will be part of a record nine international games in 2026, across four continents, seven countries and eight stadiums.\n\n\"I think that's really cool for him,\" Henry Hodgson, general manager at NFL UK and Ireland, told BBC Sport. \"I was lucky to spend some time with his older brother, Equanimeous, at their family home in Cologne. They're really proud of their German heritage.\n\n\"Reflecting back on 2019, when Efe Obada got the chance to play at Tottenham with the Carolina Panthers, it's really special for players who have that history, that heritage in a country, to be able to go there and show people, in real life, what it is that they do.\n\n\"I'm sure he will embrace that opportunity. He's one of the most exciting receivers in the NFL and with a really successful team, so that's a really exciting game to be bringing to Munich.\"\n\nJacksonville have played in each London series since 2013 and this will be the third time they play back-to-back games in the UK.\n\nThe Jaguars were the first team to play two international games in the same season in 2023 and have taken the option to have two home games in London this year while their stadium is being renovated.\n\nThey will play at Wembley and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the Washington Commanders hosting the other game at Tottenham.\n\nWhile Washington, who won three Super Bowls between 1983 and 1992, played in the NFL's first game in Spain last season, this will be just the second time the franchise has played in London and the first since 2016.\n\n\"Washington's traditionally had a good following in the UK,\" said Hodgson. \"It's been a long time since they were here so I think people will be excited to see the Commanders.\n\n\"They're just a year and a bit removed from being one game away from the Super Bowl, and I'm sure they are intent on finding their way back to the play-offs in 2026.\"\n\nHodgson also hinted at a special celebration to mark the 20th anniversary of the first regular-season game that was played in London in October 2007.\n\n\"The NFL continues to go from strength and strength when it comes to playing games around the world,\" he said. \"The commissioner and [team] ownership have been intent on really trying to find ways to expand the global footprint of the NFL, but at the heart of that is where this started.\n\n\"We've been here [in London] for nearly 20 years now so it's a really important market for the NFL. We've seen tremendous growth of the fanbase over that period of time, but yeah, the commitment by the NFL to playing in the UK is real and lasting.\n\n\"What's around the corner? Well, 2027 will be the 20th anniversary of games in London. We'll have to see what that brings.\"\n\nWhile the NFL will be playing games in Australia and France for the first time in 2026, the league will not make an immediate return to Ireland after staging its first Dublin game in 2025.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers' win over the Minnesota Vikings attracted more visitors from the United States than any of the NFL's 62 regular-season games played internationally.\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell said during Super Bowl week that the league \"will be back, I would guess in a few years\" and Hodgson was in Dublin this week to discuss the economic impact of last year's game.\n\n\"I think the Irish government were particularly excited about what that had done in terms of bringing visitors and, ultimately, the [overall] impact,\" he said.\n\n\"After that, I was able to have a conversation with some of the folks that we'd worked with initially to bring the 2025 game to Dublin and we had some positive conversations about possibly bringing more games in the future.\n\n\"All of that is to be determined, but we said originally we would play a game there and then we would collectively sit down and reflect on whether it worked for both sides. I think everyone agrees that it was a real success by all standards and all measures.\"\n\nWhat's next for NFL as latest international games confirmed?\n\n49ers to host game as NFL makes Mexico return\n\nLondon, United Kingdom (two at Tottenham, one at Wembley)\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Five security lessons from the FBI's Washington Post raid",
    "description": "Court documents show how investigators can track digital activities, and reveal ways to harden journalists’ devices",
    "fullText": "The January FBI raid of the home of Washington Post federal government reporter Hannah Natanson, in connection with a leak probe involving a government contractor, was a dangerous escalation against press freedom and likely runs afoul of the Privacy Protection Act. It shouldn’t have happened at all.\n\nA judge has since ordered that the government preserve, but not review, the materials seized during the raid. We’ve recently examined a court document that shines light on some specifics of the case, and think journalists can learn something from what it reveals.\n\nThe court filing suggests Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones, the government contractor, allegedly viewed a document later published by Natanson and took screenshots before pasting those images into a new Microsoft Word document.\n\nIf you use a work-issued computer or phone at any well-resourced organization, like a government agency, it’s quite likely that there are a handful of technologies to track employee activities baked into your device.\n\nServices like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 provide administrators with audit logs of employees’ activities, such as the user who opened a given document, actions taken in the document, and when they were taken.\n\nIn practice, this means investigators could see a list of everyone who accessed a leaked document and make a short list of likely sources of the leak.\n\nMany workplaces also use mobile device management services to equip workplace devices with security monitoring, control, and visibility into those devices.\n\nIn this case, we see that investigators were able to detect Perez-Lugones’ screenshot, which likely would have removed some metadata — information about the original document — before he printed it out as a new document.\n\nA well-resourced work environment, unfortunately, has an extraordinary level of visibility into employees’ activities on their devices. Sources should therefore generally assume what they do on workplace laptops, phones, networks, and physical spaces is being recorded.\n\nThe document suggests investigators were authorized to force the reporter to use biometrics to unlock devices, using her fingerprints or the face scanners built into her devices.\n\nAfter seizing her MacBook Pro, Natanson was told to unlock it with her fingerprint.\n\nWhile rare, we have seen other examples of law enforcement actors obtaining permission and attempting to use biometric unlocks with tools like Face ID and Touch ID to force reporters to unlock their devices.\n\nThere is a place for biometrics — the alternative would be typing in your passcode dozens or even hundreds of times each day, which would encourage weaker passcodes. (And we hope you use a long, unique passcode!)\n\nBut if you are going into a scenario where you expect it’s possible your phone may be seized, such as when going through airport security, disabling biometrics doesn’t hurt.\n\nNatanson probably couldn’t reasonably have predicted that her devices were about to be seized, and it’s therefore harder to prepare for a situation like this.\n\nWe do know that many raids happen before dawn, so this points to a benefit in shutting down your computer before bed and when not in use.\n\nYou can also quickly disable biometrics at any time by holding the power button and the volume-up button on your phone at the same time. This will immediately disable biometrics on an iPhone, but on Android, you may need to click “Lockdown” afterward. Android users may need to enable this from the Settings app.\n\nIf you feel comfortable simply typing in your passcode on your desktop computer, consider disabling biometrics on your desktop and using a passcode to unlock the device. You can always continue using biometric features like Touch ID on your laptop with other services after the device is unlocked.\n\nOnce investigators unlocked her workplace laptop, they took photos and audio recordings of the conversations in the laptop’s Signal application.\n\nThis also brings up the challenging question of when to use Signal for Desktop. Signal for Desktop is convenient — I use it every day. But Signal is only as secure as your devices.\n\nIt first needs to be installed on your mobile device, which comes with its own risk of being infected with malware that could compromise your messages.\n\nIf you link your Signal account to your desktop, you are introducing even more risk. That’s a choice you’ll have to make.\n\nRegardless, you need to keep your Signal app up to date, along with every device using Signal, to ensure you’re receiving the newest security patches.\n\nLikewise, there are situations where journalists may need to retain their messages, but not all messages need to live on your device indefinitely.\n\nWhen possible, reporters may want to enable Signal’s disappearing messages to minimize the risk of your messages being read if someone snatches your phone, or simply in case of loss or theft. Read our guide to locking down Signal to learn how to set it up.\n\nIt appears data on the reporter’s iPhone could not be extracted using forensic devices, at least in part because Apple’s Lockdown Mode was enabled.\n\nWhat’s Lockdown Mode, you ask? It’s an optional feature built into Apple devices that allows you to harden your device by disabling some features, such as certain forms of message attachments.\n\nImportantly, when your iPhone is locked, it also disables connections from accessories, such as USB devices. Many forensic devices plug directly into your phone in order to connect, and this means they appear to have a tougher time connecting when Lockdown Mode is enabled.\n\nIf you feel at risk, consider trying out Lockdown Mode, or if you have an Android phone, enable Advanced Protection. Disabling some technologies to harden your device may affect how your phone works slightly. But you may appreciate the added assurance.\n\nResearch from forensic companies like Cellebrite shows that they have a tougher time breaking into newer and up-to-date phones. So while you’re at it, download your updates as soon as you can. Read more about mobile device safety.\n\nWe understand that investigators seized multiple devices, including an audio recorder and an external hard drive.\n\nUsually, there is no straightforward way to encrypt certain devices, such as dedicated cameras and recording devices. However, you can off-load information from these devices immediately to a device that you can encrypt, such as your computer.\n\nYou can encrypt your computer’s drive by enabling FileVault for Macs, and BitLocker for Windows Pro’s Enterprise and Education editions. On Linux, you can encrypt your device with LUKS. A modern, up-to-date iPhone or Android device will be encrypted by default by simply having a passcode.\n\nNote that disk encryption is fully enabled until you type in your passcode to decrypt the device. The easiest way to enable disk encryption is therefore to simply power down your device.\n\nThis raid was extraordinary, but the things we can do to protect the data on our devices are not, and may apply to more routine security issues, like the potential for loss or theft. Take some time to learn about things you can do to protect your device by reading our guide to mobile maintenance. And journalists can always reach out to our digital security team for assistance.",

    "description": "Federal authorities are barred from conducting an “unsupervised, wholesale search” of electronic devices that they seized from a Washington Post reporter’s Virginia home while investigating allegation...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal authorities are barred from conducting an “unsupervised, wholesale search” of electronic devices that they seized from a Washington Post reporter’s Virginia home while investigating allegations that a Pentagon contractor illegally leaked classified information to the journalist, a magistrate judge ruled Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Porter said he will independently review the contents of Post reporter Hannah Natanson's devices instead of allowing a Justice Department “filter team” to perform a search. Porter said he balanced the need to protect Natanson's free speech rights with the government's duty to safeguard top secret national security information.\n\n“The Court finds that seizing the totality of a reporter’s electronic work product, including tools essential to ongoing newsgathering, constitutes a restraint on the exercise of First Amendment rights,” he wrote.\n\nThe case has drawn national attention and scrutiny from press freedom advocates who say it reflects a more aggressive posture by the Justice Department toward leak investigations involving journalists.\n\nFederal agents seized a phone, two laptops, a recorder, a portable hard drive and a Garmin smart watch when they searched Natanson’s home in Alexandria, Virginia, on Jan. 14. Last month, Porter agreed to temporarily bar the government from reviewing any material from Natanson’s devices. Tuesday's order extends that prohibition.\n\n“The Court’s genuine hope is that this search was conducted — as the government contends — to gather evidence of a crime in a single case, not to collect information about confidential sources from a reporter who has published articles critical of the administration,” he wrote.\n\nThe Post sought an order requiring the government to immediately return the devices to its reporter, but Porter denied that request. He said it is reasonable for the government to keep nothing more than the “limited information” responsive to the search warrant. The rest of the contents must be returned to Natanson, he ruled.\n\nAllowing the government to search a reporter’s work material, including unrelated information from confidential sources, “is the equivalent of leaving the government’s fox in charge of the Washington Post’s henhouse,” Porter wrote.\n\nPentagon contractor Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones was arrested on Jan. 8 and charged with unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents. Perez-Lugones is accused of taking home printouts of classified documents from his workplace and later passing them to Natanson.\n\nThe newspaper’s attorneys accused authorities of violating legal safeguards for journalists and trampling on Natanson’s First Amendment rights.\n\nJustice Department attorneys argued that the government is entitled to keep the seized material because it contains evidence in an ongoing investigation with national security implications.\n\nThe FBI began investigating after the Post on Oct. 31 published an article containing classified information from an intelligence report, according to the government. The Post reporter co-wrote and contributed to at least five articles that contained classified information provided by Perez-Lugones, authorities said.\n\nNatanson has been covering Republican President Donald Trump’s transformation of the federal government. The Post published a piece in which she described gaining hundreds of new sources from the federal workforce, leading one colleague to call her “the federal government whisperer.”\n\nThe Post says the seized material spanned years of Natanson’s reporting across hundreds of stories, including communications with confidential sources.\n\nThe Justice Department has internal guidelines governing its response to news media leaks. Last April, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued new guidelines restoring prosecutors’ authority to use subpoenas, court orders and search warrants to hunt for government officials who make “unauthorized disclosures” to journalists.\n\nThe new guidelines rescinded a policy from Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration that protected journalists from having their phone records secretly seized during leak investigations.\n\nPerez-Lugones, 61, of Laurel, Maryland, has remained jailed since his arrest. He held a top-secret security clearance while working as a systems engineer and information technology specialist for a government contractor.\n\nInvestigators found phone messages between Perez-Lugones and the reporter in which they discussed the information that he provided, authorities said. “I’m going quiet for a bit ... just to see if anyone starts asking questions,” Perez-Lugones wrote after sending one of the documents, according to the government.",

    "description": "The rowhouse in Washington, DC, was built in 1794, but has some modern flourishes. See the historic home.",
    "fullText": "Surrounded by modern developments along Washington, DC's Southwest waterfront, a slice of 18th-century Federalist America still proudly sits in the nation's capital. The Wheat Row homes, a collection of rowhouses along 4th Street SW, have stood the test of time, and now one of them is up for sale.\n\n1317 4th Street SW has a listing price of $1.3 million and offers the charm of a historic house with more modern touches throughout, according to Eric Stewart, the home's listing agent from Long & Foster Real Estate.\n\n\"It's comfortable for contemporary living and enjoyment, but with the heart of classic colonialism,\" Stewart told Business Insider.\n\nThis colonial heart isn't all talk — the homes are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and were among the first housing developments built in DC after it became America's capital city.\n\nThe property's current seller is a retired history professor with an appreciation for the home's past, according to Stewart. Stewart said the ideal potential buyer would carry this same appreciation.\n\n\"Everybody wants to be able to see something built in that era, but not everybody wants to live in a home from that age,\" Stewart said.\n\nToday, the home is fitted with more modern amenities, sparing potential buyers the conditions the first residents endured before DC had a sewage system.\n\nTake a look inside this historic Wheat Row home.\n\nThough the four-floor home is narrow and compact, the 12-foot ceilings make for a spacious interior.\n\nHardwood floors cover nearly the entire house, including the stairs.\n\nThe home has eye-catching millwork in nearly every room. According to Stewart, the home's wooden moldings date back to the 19th century and possibly earlier.\n\nThis extensive woodworking was common in this era of homes, with moldings and trims produced by skilled artisans influenced by European styles, according to Pebbles & Thorns Woodworking.\n\nIn multiple rooms, there are low-hanging chandeliers or candle-like light fixtures, once again defined by the colonial era.\n\nChandeliers were once a symbol of wealth and extravagance, and while that standard is still reflected in modern design, the introduction of electric lighting in the late 19th century allowed for more affordable chandeliers, per The Examiner News.\n\nEven though the elevator was added in 2005, it has a classic charm, with all-wooden walls inside.\n\nThe home's large kitchen was last renovated over half a century ago, meaning it would need about $100,000 of work to bring it into the modern era, by Stewart's estimates.\n\nAlternatively, a buyer could work to restore the kitchen's true colonial look and feel with classic wooden cabinets and finishes.\n\nThis not only creates the potential for multiple residents, but the home's four different floors also allow for privacy.\n\nThe home's 1950s bathrooms could also be renovated. One quirk is split bathrooms on the third and fourth floors — they have a shower and toilet/sink separated by a wall.\n\nCommon for the time period, the property's centerpieces are its seven fireplaces, which appear on every single floor of the home.\n\nAlthough this defining feature adds to the home's quaintness, it creates hurdles for any buyer considering renovation. Stewart said that the rooms' layout around the fireplaces complicates any attempts at reconfiguration.\n\n\"We're looking for a buyer who likes a home that is older in style and feel and embraces the uniqueness of the property, or somebody that has the vision to restore the majesty of the property, but refresh and renew it into a 21st-century rowhouse,\" Stewart said.\n\nWith lots of opportunities for renovation, the home could appeal to buyers looking for a project.\n\n\"It poses a good value for someone who has a vision,\" Stewart added.\n\nStewart said the housing market in Southwest Washington, DC, has been struggling after a wave of job cuts last year.\n\nHistoric homes like the Wheat Row home could attract outside buyers looking to stake their claim in pieces of American history.\n\nThe Wheat Row homes sit along DC's Washington Channel, running parallel to the Potomac River.\n\nWheat Row residents, as part of the Harbour Square co-op, get access to a rooftop deck, which overlooks the water. Other co-op amenities include a shared heated pool, gardens, and a fitness center.\n\nThe home sits in the middle of a booming modern neighborhood known as The Wharf, which has undergone redevelopment over the past two decades.\n\nThe area is filled with theaters and concert halls, offices, restaurants, and public spaces.",

    "description": "Over and over, the Republicans and former Republicans who gathered just outside Washington this weekend warned that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are tearing at the very fabric of ...",
    "fullText": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. (AP) — Over and over, the Republicans and former Republicans who gathered just outside Washington this weekend warned that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are tearing at the very fabric of American democracy.\n\nA former congressman described the president's party as an “authoritarian-embracing cult.” A prominent conservative writer said Trumpism is an \"existential threat.\" And a retired Army general, his voice shaking with emotion, cited post-Nazi Germany as a roadmap for the nation's post-Trump recovery.\n\nIt's unclear how many people are listening.\n\nThe main convention hall at the sixth annual Principles First summit on Saturday and Sunday was half empty. About 750 chairs were set up in a room that could have fit thousands, and many were unfilled. Not a single current Republican elected official participated in the two-day program.\n\nThis is what remains of the Grand Old Party’s Never Trump movement, a coalition of Republicans, former Republicans and independents who banded together as Trump consolidated power. They largely remain political exiles — not quite at home among Democrats yet disgusted by how the president has abandoned Republicans' longstanding commitments to free trade and limited government.\n\nJohn McDowell, 69, who was a lifelong Republican before Trump’s emergence, acknowledged that the diminished group had virtually “zero” political clout within his former party.\n\n“It’s just a fact. We’re losing good people,” said McDowell, a former Capitol Hill staffer and county Republican official from San Carlos, California. “The party is becoming more and more MAGA-fied.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed all the criticism from what she called “a bunch of deranged has-been politicians.”\n\n“The only people who will pay attention to this event are the journalists who are forced to cover it,” she said.\n\nVirtually everyone who gathered at the hotel in National Harbor, Maryland, said they are rooting for Democratic victories in this fall's midterm elections. One of the only Democrats there was Conor Lamb, a former congressman from Pennsylvania who lost his party's primary to John Fetterman four years ago.\n\nDespite dire concerns, there was a slight sense of optimism among the half-empty convention hall and quiet hotel hallways.\n\nSeveral people cheered last week’s Supreme Court decision to strike down Trump’s tariffs, the economic tool he has wielded without congressional approval in his attempt to force friends and foes around the globe to bend to his will. Trump insisted he would implement a new round of tariffs despite the ruling.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former Trump adviser, highlighted recent AP-NORC polling showing that 1 in 4 Republicans nationwide do not approve of Trump's job performance.\n\n“It’s like any show that’s on TV for a long time — the ratings start to go down. And the ratings are going down,” Christie said. “I am willing to bet you that by next February, this room is going to be twice the size of what it is now. After the midterms, you watch.”\n\nEx-MAGA diehard Rich Logis, wearing a red “I left MAGA hat,” hopes to see “an electoral revolt against MAGA” in the midterms.\n\n“I think there’s a shift in our country right now,\" he said. \"It happens slowly.\"\n\nLogis was promoting support groups for friends and family of Trump loyalists at a table outside the convention hall. Nearby, someone was selling books about how to escape cults.\n\nAt the podium, former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh implored Trump's critics not to downplay the seriousness of the threat the president poses to the nation.\n\n“He’s everything our founders feared. Say it. Believe it,” Walsh said. He said his former party is “an authoritarian-embracing cult\" and \"a threat to everything I love.”\n\nRetired Gen. Mark Hertling, who once commanded the U.S. Army's European forces, said he's “haunted” by allies who ask him “whether American institutions ever can be trusted again.”\n\n“Our nation's institutions have been shaken. Our alliances have been strained. Our credibility has been damaged. And our nation’s values have been cast aside,” Hertling said. He suggested the U.S. should look to the reconstruction of Germany after the defeat of Nazism if it hoped to to restore the damage caused by Trump and his allies.\n\nThe nation's recovery, he said as his voiced cracked, would be something people have to earn over many years.\n\nBill Kristol, who worked in previous Republican administrations and helped found the Weekly Standard magazine, described Trump and his Republican supporters in Congress as “an existential threat” to the nation. But he was also optimistic about the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nKristol said Democrats are “almost certain to win the House,” “could possibly win the Senate,” and have “a good chance to win the presidency” in 2028.\n\nBrittany Martinez, executive director of the host organization Principles First, also tried to cast an optimistic tone, even after describing the many reasons why she couldn't bear to continue her career as a Republican staffer on Capitol Hill.\n\n“I hope that Republicans continue to wake up,” she said. “I do think that those folks exist. And I hope that they exist in greater numbers.”",

    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders made some big changes to the coaching staff this offseason.\n\nOffensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury and defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. were both let go, and David Blough and Daronte Jones were brought in, respectively. Neither Blough nor Jones has ever been a coordinator at the NFL level, but they do have some familiarity with each other.\n\nJones was with the Vikings on the defensive coaching staff from 2022 to 2025. In 2022, Blough was a practice squad quarterback for the Vikings. Recently, Washington insider JP Finlay spoke with Jones about this connection with Blough.\n\nHe was really sharp, smart,\" said Jones of Blough. \"He ran the show. It was as smooth an operation as you could have because of his knowledge of the game.\"\n\nNew #Commanders OC David Blough was a practice squad QB with the Vikings in 2022 when new DC Daronte Jones was the DBs coach there\n\nJones talks with @JPFinlayNBCS about Blough from their time together in Minnesota\n\n\"He was really sharp... he ran the show\"#RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/5Lz8fynGmS\n\n— NBC4 Sports (@NBC4Sports) February 11, 2026\n\nBlough has rapidly moved up in the ranks since retiring from playing. The former quarterback was on the practice squad of the Detroit Lions in 2023 and joined Dan Quinn's staff in Washington in 2024 as the assistant quarterbacks coach.\n\nTavita Pritchard, who was the quarterbacks coach for the Commanders, took the head coaching job at Stanford, his alma mater. That, coupled with Kingsbury's departure, moved Blough up in the pecking order, and now he'll get his first shot at running an offense.\n\nJones, meanwhile, was the defensive coordinator for the LSU Tigers in 2021 before joining the staff of the Vikings. Jones is a Maryland native, so his first shot at being a coordinator will also be a homecoming.\n\n\"You never know how your paths may cross,\" Jones explained. \"You keep those relationships alive, and we had a great relationship when we were there. And now, years later, here we are.\"\n\nThe Commanders are certainly hoping for better results across the board in 2026. The team made a surprising run to the NFC Championship Game in 2024, but thanks to injuries and inconsistency, fell to 5-12 in 2025.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Daronte Jones on David Blough: 'Really sharp'",

    "description": "Compared to the previous several weeks in the D.C. region, this past week has not been so bad. Sure, it has been rather cloudy and chilly, but temperatures have been consistently above freezing, allow...",
    "fullText": "Weather models continue to debate the strength and position of a weekend storm system.\n\nThe most likely scenario involves rain on Sunday morning changing to mix and then wet snow by Sunday night.\n\nThe threat for accumulation has come up over the last 24 hours, with most models suggesting anywhere from 1-5\" of snowfall in the D.C. region.\n\nSome extreme solutions suggest 6\" or more could be possible.\n\nWASHINGTON - Compared to the previous several weeks in the D.C. region, this past week has not been so bad. Sure, it has been rather cloudy and chilly, but temperatures have been consistently above freezing, allowing the region to slowly but steadily free itself from the so-called \"snowcrete\" that has blanketed the D.C. area for the better part of a month now.\n\nTemperatures are expected to remain above freezing into the upcoming weekend, with the best day of the entire week potentially being Saturday, with partial sunshine and middle 50s expected in the afternoon.\n\nThe big question of course, is how much snow? It’s a question that remains relatively difficult to answer even with just a couple days to go ahead of the potential storm system.\n\nThe key to any potential storm system is its track, and its intensity. These are two features that weather models have continued to struggle with.\n\nOur general thoughts in the weather department this evening lead a little closer to the European model. With temperatures well above freezing at onset, the system would likely start as a predominantly rainfall event through the front part of the day on Sunday.\n\nThen, as a surface storm pushes eastward into the Atlantic, colder air fills in as the storm pulls away, along a weather feature known as an inverted surface trough. This would bring the risk for rain to change over to mix and a perhaps a period of potentially heavy, wet snowfall on Sunday night.\n\nNow, the tricky part of the forecast with an inverted trough situation is the area that gets accumulating snowfall tends to be in a relatively narrow band that follows the trough axis, so not everyone in the region would be looking as a decent snowfall, it would be localized in this banding.\n\nForecasting exactly where it would setup is very difficult, and we would not have a good idea of where this feature sets up until likely closer to Saturday evening.\n\nIf this solution, which the European Model has been hinting at for the last couple of days, is the correct solution, then parts of our region could see a 1-3\" with an upside risk of 3-6\" snowfall potential by the time the storm exits late Sunday night into early Monday morning.\n\nOn the other hand, you have the American model solution, which for the better part of a day now has suggested the storm could be much more impactful. With a stronger tilt in the jetstream, the weather model suggest that a more intense storm system will develop that stays much closer to the coastline. While it also starts as rainfall on Sunday morning, the intensifying surface low pulls cold air quickly into the storm, dropping temperatures in the DC region and changing rainfall over to a widespread heavy snowfall.\n\nThe model is aggressive with a heavy, impactful snowfall for everyone, with final snow totals in the double digits.\n\nNow, most forecasters agree this evening that this solution is rather extreme and unlikely to be the case with this storm. While we cannot rule it out of the realm of possibility, it is generally on its own, with most other guidance as of Thursday night suggesting lesser snowfall totals are more likely.\n\nYou can see the westward jump reflected in the 18z European Ensemble members as well. That's a pretty noticeable jump. \n\nNow again, it's not GFS level. Breaking down the numbers, European went up in every category. Most noticable...the threat for a 4\"+ snow event went from 30% to… pic.twitter.com/pr5tDqQIGQ\n\n— Mike Thomas (@MikeTFox5) February 20, 2026\n\nSo, if we do not believe the American model solution, what is the debate this evening? The issue lies in model consistency. Weather models have admittedly been extremely poor with the forecast solutions for the Sunday storm system. Even the European, which does have a history of being more accurate than the American model, has been extremely \"jumpy\" with this storm system. Sometimes jumping the system east, showing less snowfall, then bringing the storm back west, showing more snowfall. Forecasters look for run-to-run consistency, and so far we really have not seen that from any weather model just yet.\n\nThe reason why has everything to do with the pattern. It is not just one piece of atmospheric energy helping steer this storm system, but multiple. The more pieces you have involved with a developing storm system, the more prone you are to errors in the forecast. This is why we might not have a truly good hold on what this system could do in the DC region until closer to Friday night or even Saturday, when the energy pieces involved in the formation of this storm system are all well sampled and better analyzed.\n\nThis one is going to come down to the wire in terms of figuring out snowfall amounts. What I can guarantee is this will not be a repeat of the late January storm.\n\nTemperatures will not be as cold, even after the system — no \"snowcrete\" this time around. This would also be wet snow, and we would likely lose some to ground melt in areas no longer covered in snow from the January system, as temperatures have been above freezing much of this week.\n\nA key thing we want to mention: A lot of people are saying, \"but it is too warm to snow on Sunday! The Weather App says it will be in the 40s!\" While yes, this is too warm to snow at onset...remember that your weather app is giving you the high temperature for the day.\n\nThrough a process known as dynamic cooling, temperatures can cool as you bring in cooler air on the back side of a storm system, due to the upper-level trough swinging through. So, temperatures would be falling throughout the day.\n\nThe time frame we are most concerned with at the moment is Sunday afternoon and particularly the evening hours. While we do not anticipate at this time this will be a major, city shutdown type of snowfall, the most likely timing of it does mean that the risk is there for closures and delays to schools and other activities on Monday morning.\n\nOf course, how extensive these could be really depends on the final track and intensity of this storm system, and in the interest of forecast integrity we are not yet confident on any snowfall numbers to put out our expectations.\n\nWhat we will continue to do is keep you updated and informed ahead of this potential on Sunday.\n\nTo reiterate, at this time we are leaning towards the potential for a lower impact accumulating winter snowfall type event as opposed to a major snowstorm.\n\nFOX 5 will continue to monitor the threat and let you know if we think a more impactful system will hit the region.",

    "fullText": "It took about a half for things to get rolling consistently, but the Sioux Falls Washington girls basketball team was able to get out in transition and run past Sioux Falls Roosevelt 69-43 on Friday, Feb. 20.\n\nThe Rough Riders were intent on getting the ball inside to 6-foot-3 sophomore Kalli Harris, which slowed the game down considerably. Roosevelt was able to hang around in the first half as Washington's half-court offense struggled to get going, but the Warriors still led 34-23 at the break.\n\n\"You've got to give Roosevelt credit,\" Washington head coach Jamie Parish said. \"The first thing that they did was kept going inside with the basketball, and that brought all of our kids down to protect the rim. Then it's a longer run when you have to get down and play physical.\"\n\nThe Warriors know they're at their best when they're out in transition and spent halftime trying to get to that more often.\n\nDana Harpe with a rebound off a Roosevelt miss and passes it to Josie Biteler for two. Washington leads 46-26 with 3:58 left in the third. Warriors have been cruising since they started to push the pace more. @ArgusSports pic.twitter.com/Oc2f29mvYa\n\n— Paul Cifonelli (@PCifonelli) February 21, 2026\n\n\"When we went in there, we knew we could play better and we knew we could get good shots easily, but we wanted to get the best shots by swinging it, moving it, giving it multiple touches,\" senior guard Dana Harpe said.\n\nParish knew it wouldn't be easy against a gritty Roosevelt team that played hard, and stressed to his girls that they needed to run the floor wide and run their lanes to get the ball up the floor quicker.\n\n\"We were told they weren't going to roll over and die, so just had to do our part and keep playing hard and keep playing as a team,\" senior guard Rylan Kennett said.\n\nWashington got out and ran immediately in the second half, starting the third with a 12-3 run to blow the game wide open.\n\n\"We're a team that thrives in transition,\" Harpe said. \"We're a really long team. We'll get up the court in five seconds. I feel like that translates on defense. If we get a good defensive possession we're going out in our outlets, and I feel like that's working well for us.\"\n\nThe Warriors got a lot of their fast-break chances from their defense, whether it was on steals or long rebounds. Parish wanted his girls to force more 3-pointers to get longer rebounds, which came with Roosevelt sophomore Henlee Loof making a few. Despite that, Washington stuck in its aggressive 2-3 zone that has led it to a 14-3 record this year.\n\n\"We tried to go a little bit of man and they got a couple baskets out of it,\" Parrish said. \"We're more comfortable in our zone. It's the thing that we practice, it's the thing that we stick to. We do give our kids a little bit of freedom in that zone to chase a kid. Our zone can change shapes and do some things.\"\n\nGood ball movement leads to a Rylan Kennett bucket. Washington up 27-15 with 5:35 left before halftime @ArgusSports pic.twitter.com/qc2GZV9M2T\n\n— Paul Cifonelli (@PCifonelli) February 20, 2026\n\nWashington now has two consecutive wins after back-to-back losses at home against Brandon Valley and at O'Gorman. The Warriors are looking to play like they did in the second half the rest of the regular season and into the postseason.\n\n\"We need to play to our standard every game no matter who we play because that's the only way we'll get better,\" Kennett said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sioux Falls Argus Leader: Washington girls basketball uses transition to race past Roosevelt",

    "fullText": "Former Oklahoma Sooners assistant director of player personnel JP Losman left the program last offseason to get back to an on-field role, and it's a move that paid off, as he's earned a promotion this week.\n\nLosman spent three seasons at OU, but served as the assistant quarterbacks coach at Washington last year. After head coach Jedd Fisch and the Huskies parted ways with offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Jimmie Doughtery, they made the decision to promote Losman to quarterbacks coach, according to a report from ESPN's Adam Rittenberg.\n\nLosman aided in the development of star UW quarterback Demond Williams Jr., and he has extensive experience playing the position as well. He played his college ball at Tulane, where he served as a two-year starter in 2002 and 2003.\n\n— Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) February 18, 2026\n\nAfter being a first-round pick in the 2004 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills, he also played for the Oakland Raiders, Seattle Seahawks, and Miami Dolphins. His coaching career began at Clemson in 2017 and Brent Venables brought him to Norman in 2022. Losman's wife, Zulaikha, was also on staff with the Sooners during the same timeframe he was. She served as OU's director of SOUL mission, player/parent relations.\n\nLosman's time with the Seahawks saw him partner with Fisch, who is the Huskies' offensive play-caller. Washington is still searching for a new offensive coordinator.\n\nFor the Sooners, they have replaced three position coaches already this offseason. OU officially announced the hiring of tight ends coach Jason Witten, and Oklahoma is reported to be hiring LaMar Morgan to coach defensive backs and Deland McCullough to coach running backs.\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions. You can also follow Aaron on X@Aaron_Gelvin.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sooners Wire: Former Oklahoma staff member earns promotion at Big Ten school",

That isn't good.\n\nFor Sports Illustrated's Gilberto Manzano, the Commanders can't go all-in again on veteran players.\n\n\"The Commanders thought they were a few players away from finishing what they started in their surprising first season with Daniels in 2024,\" Manzano wrote.\n\n\"If Daniels can stay healthy, he proved in his sensational rookie year that he’s capable of elevating his teammates regardless of who’s on the field. GM Adam Peters overlooked that and made unnecessary trades for older players, depleting the team's draft picks for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nMore: Analyst offers Mike Evans reality that might soothe Buccaneers' worries\n\nIf we are being honest, one of the biggest worries over Jayden coming into the NFL was his slender frame and what that might mean for his longevity in the league.\n\nGranted, he is only two years into his career, but he has already suffered multiple injuries and only played seven games in 2025.\n\nSo, the Commanders have to figure out a way to get Daniels back playing as he did in his rookie season, but also keeping him healthy, because the franchise can't afford for the injuries to pile up this early in his career.\n\nHow they approach it will be interesting, and how the franchise handles free agency is a fascinating watch as well.\n\nJust remember, Mr. Peters, no more veteran trades.\n\nESPN analyst makes stunning call on future of Chiefs' Travis Kelce\n\nBills face huge $19 million decision on underrated star\n\nPatriots named as potential landing spot for $25 million sack monster\n\n2 huge free agency decisions set to impact Bills' Josh Allen\n\nAnalyst urges Ravens not to make 'stupid' offseason move\n\nAnalyst ripped to shreds over embarrassing Mike Evans Buccaneers Super Bowl take\n\nWill Ravens' Lamar Jackson need Superman cape under new OC?",

No offensive coordinator has been listed on the university’s website for the 2026 season.\n\nDougherty, who last season added the offensive coordinator title after serving as the Huskies’ passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2024, said it was an “honor” to represent the University of Washington Tuesday night on social media.\n\n“To the city of Seattle, words can’t express what you mean to me and my family!!!” Dougherty said. “Most of all the players, love you guys forever, thank you.”\n\nDougherty, 47, began working alongside Washington head coach Jedd Fisch in 2021 when both were at Arizona. When Fisch was hired at Washington, Dougherty followed him and eventually became an offensive coordinator for the first time since he held that role at San Jose State in 2014.\n\n“I have worked with Jimmie Dougherty for 7 years and am appreciative for his many contributions to our success as an offense and as a team,” Fisch said on social media. “I want to thank Jimmie and wish him all the best in the future.”\n\nIt is unclear where Dougherty, who has also previously coached at Illinois Wesleyan, San Diego, San Jose State, Michigan and UCLA, is headed next. Whoever fills his role will inherit an offense that will be led by quarterback Demond Williams Jr., who was the subject of controversy last month because of his entering and exiting the transfer portal.",

States, including California, have been among the main foils to various ⁠Trump administration policies, launching dozens of suits. California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Tuesday told Reuters about plans to ​sue over ​changes in vaccine policy and ​a plan to challenge ‌the rescission of a key Environmental Protection Agency finding, known as the endangerment finding, that was key to climate change regulation, for instance.\n\nThe new suit responds in part to California's loss of $1.2 billion in federal funding for ‌the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen ​Energy Systems, or ARCHES, Bonta ​said. The hydrogen plan ​was intended to replace fossil fuels in ‌utilities, public transit, trucking and ​ports.\n\nFederal agencies must ​execute laws, California said. \"It's as simple as Congress has the power of the purse, not the executive ​branch, and Congress ‌already appropriated this funding,\" Bonta said in an ​interview on Tuesday, ahead of the announcement.",

    "fullText": "Washington saw its flickering NCAA Tournament hopes fully extinguished with a dispiriting home less to Penn St this week. What once looked like a drive to the finish now looks frighteningly like the Dawgs having to play out the string against the fellow Big 10 bottom-dwellers. The Huskies welcome one of those bottom-dwellers to Alaska Airlines Arena on Saturday evening when the Minnesota Golden Gophers (11-13, 4-9) come to Seattle.\n\nThe Gophers are led by big, versatile guard Cade Tyson. The 6’7” averages over 19 points, 5 rebounds, and 2 assists per game while shooting 49% overall and 39% from three. He has a bizarre shooting split with 45% from outside at home and 18% on the road (but many more games and attempts at home pulling up the average). The Gopher offense focuses on ball movement, with four players averaging between 2.4-4.5 assists per game and another four with more than 4 3PA per game. First-year HC Niko Medved has shown improvement, but the formula has not translated into many wins in conference. After early wins against Iowa and Indiana, the Gophers have lost eight of their last nine, although the one win was over a top-10 Michigan St team.\n\nOverall, the Gophers have been poor away from home, only beating Northwestern outside of Williams Arena. Does that show a unique talent against purple teams, or can the Dawgs bounce back from the Penn St game? The game will tip off at 6:00 PM PT and will air on NBC Sports/Peacock.",

    "description": "Nick Rallis returns as DC under new head coach Mike LaFleur.",
    "fullText": "While many Arizona Cardinals fans lose their minds over the decision to have Nick Rallis return as the team’s defensive coordinator, it’s obvious new head coach Mike LaFleur paid more attention to what affected the Cardinals in 2025 than those fans did.\n\nIn an interview with Cardinals reporter Dani Sureck after being introduced to the media 10 days ago, LaFleur was asked the impression the team’s defense had on him after playing against them six times in the last three seasons.\n\n“We've had some rough days against this defense,” he said.\n\nFor those who are guffawing at that comment and have serious cases of collective amnesia, consider that the Rams scored a total of 23 points in the two 2024 games against the Cardinals.\n\nAs for the troubles last season, LaFleur addressed that when he said, “Just going back to this year (2025) because every year changes, when we played them the first time, I think it was Week 11, maybe Week 12 from an NFL season standpoint, but our 11th game. And I remember (quarterback) Matthew (Stafford) coming into me on that Tuesday saying this doesn't look like their record. This looks like a really good defense because there are players there.”\n\nOf course, as many understand but not those that reside in the coaches-are-bad bubble, LaFleur obviously did when he noted, \"Unfortunately a lot of them weren't out there, particularly in that back half of the season. So that's my job and our job as a building to figure out how we can make sure that those best players are consistently out on the field.\"\n\nReality in the NFL is that game planning and in-game calls on both sides of the ball are based on what players are capable of and who is available. The facts are that during the 2025 season, 21 defensive players missed 161 games. Eleven were on a reserve list with an injury during the season. In the final nine games, 19 players missed 82 games. That can't be ignored even though many people do.\n\nAs LaFleur said in a statement Friday, “Nick is someone I have always had great respect for, especially going against him in the division over the last three years. During the interview process, I expressed that he was someone I held in high regard and would be very interested in talking to about the position.\n\n“I’ve had the chance to meet with him and pick his brain over the last couple weeks and am even more impressed than I was before. I know the respect he has from coaches around the league and especially with the players on this team and that says a lot to me.”\n\nEven if the loud outside narrative believes they know more than those that watch hours and hours of tape while actually working and grinding in the sport.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "description": "WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is dramatically expanding an effort to revoke U.S. citizenship for foreign-born Americans as it works to curb immigration, according to two people familiar with t...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is dramatically expanding an effort to revoke U.S. citizenship for foreign-born Americans as it works to curb immigration, according to two people familiar with the plans.\n\nOver the past several months, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that’s responsible for legal immigration, has been sending experts to its offices around the country or reassigning staff members to focus on whether some citizens processed through those offices could now be denaturalized, these people said.\n\nThe goal of emphasizing naturalized citizens is to supply the office of immigration litigation with 100 to 200 possible cases per month, one of the people familiar with the plans said. Such cases have typically been very rare, involving people who concealed criminal histories or previous human rights violations during their application processes. The New York Times first reported the quota.\n\nThe effort is part of the overall push by Homeland Security to drastically curtail immigration and deliver on Trump’s policy agenda. The push has included DHS’ sending scores of immigration enforcement officers into U.S. cities on deportation missions and purchasing mega warehouses to hold detainees.\n\nDHS has also increasingly sought to remove legal immigrants from the U.S. by revoking thousands of visas, including for some people who participated in pro-Palestinian protests, and trying to deport green card holders.\n\nA spokesman for USCIS, Matthew Tragesser, said the agency reviews cases of naturalized citizens when there is credible evidence that citizenship was obtained through fraud or misrepresentation.\n\n“We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards fraud in the naturalization process and will pursue denaturalization proceedings for any individual who lied or misrepresented themselves,” he said. “We will continue to relentlessly pursue those undermining the integrity of America’s immigration system and work alongside the Department of Justice to ensure that only those who meet citizenship standards retain the privilege of U.S. citizenship.”\n\nTrump administration officials are looking for shortcuts to speed up the process, the two people familiar with the plans said. USCIS officials have concluded that dedicating staff members, either by sending experts or by training them across the agency’s 80-plus field offices nationwide, would be more effective in rooting out more cases than the previous Trump effort, headquartered in a warehouse in Pasadena, California, they said.\n\nThe Justice Department has already told attorneys to focus on denaturalization cases, and it has offered possible case examples, from “individuals who pose a risk to national security” or who have engaged in war crimes or torture to people who have committed Medicaid or Medicare fraud or have otherwise defrauded the government.\n\nThere is also a broad catch-all provision that refers to “any other cases ... that the division determines to be sufficiently important to pursue.”\n\nOften the cases go on beyond a presidential administration. According to Justice Department figures, the Trump administration won 86 cases during Trump’s first term. During the Biden administration, 54 cases were won.\n\nTrump has long been preoccupied with the notion of citizenship — who gets to be an American and who doesn’t — and has expressed displeasure with immigrants from what he calls third world nations. He is separately seeking the power to strip citizenship from those born to foreigners in the U.S., though “birthright citizenship” appears in the Constitution. The Supreme Court is weighing his argument.\n\nTrump’s Truth Social message to Americans on Thanksgiving Day last year was that he would remove anyone who wasn’t a “net asset” to the U.S. “or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.”\n\nRoughly 800,000 people become naturalized citizens every year, according to DHS. To become a naturalized citizen, a candidate must be over 18, already be a legal permanent resident, speak English, know U.S. history and social studies and have “good moral character,” according to the Immigration and Naturalization Act.\n\nForeign-born Americans were generally stripped of citizenship only if they were found to have committed fraud during their application processes. In past decades, those cases focused on ferreting out former Nazis who fled to the U.S. after World War II under false pretenses. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have sought to increase investigations, but it’s still rare for a reason, a former USCIS official said.\n\n“It’s so important for current and future naturalized U.S. citizens to know that no president can unilaterally strip people of the citizenship they’ve worked so hard to earn,” said Doug Rand, another former USCIS official.\n\nThe denaturalization process is lengthy and time-consuming, and there is a high legal bar. Even if the administration makes the push to investigate someone with the aim to denaturalize, it could take years, and a subsequent deportation would take even longer.\n\n“Denaturalization is a significant tool that should be used in rare cases,” said Sarah Pierce, an immigration policy analyst who was a USCIS official under former President Joe Biden.\n\nPierce said USCIS has a lot of discretion when it decides to approve someone for naturalization, so it’s possible that someone who had no issues flagged upon becoming a citizen could face additional scrutiny now.\n\nShe said there were concerns that some of the Trump administration’s immigration policy changes could “make some naturalized citizens vulnerable to claims of fraud or misrepresentation retroactively.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers recently introduced a bill that would allow the government to strip citizenship from anyone found to have committed fraud against the government or joined a terrorist group or anyone who is convicted of a serious felony within 10 years of their citizenship.\n\nSo far in Trump’s second term, 16 cases have been filed and the administration has won seven, including one case involving a man originally from the United Kingdom who had been convicted of receiving and distributing sexually explicit images of children.\n\nDeborah Chen, supervising attorney at the New York Legal Assistance Group’s immigrant protection services program, said some clients who had pending naturalization applications when the new policies went into effect were denied because they owed taxes, even though they were on payment plans.\n\nShe added that it could signal that immigration officers may be seeking more proof of “good moral character,” which they prove by showing “positive attributes,” such as family caregiving, educational attainment, stable employment and community involvement.\n\nThere are growing concerns that the DHS effort is more about creating fear and less about successfully stripping citizenship. Even if Americans swept up in investigations aren’t prosecuted or convicted, the process takes a financial and emotional toll; they’d have to hire lawyers and produce documents.\n\nMargy O’Herron, a senior fellow in the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, said the mere threat of denaturalization creates real terror.\n\n“Citizens are afraid that if they do or say something the government doesn’t like — even if those things are lawful and protected by the Constitution — they will be a target,” she said.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "description": "The Detroit Lions blocked the Dolphins’ request to interview Bruce Gradkowski — denying help to new Miami head coach and former Packers DC Jeff Hafley.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions aren’t just protecting their coaching staff, they’re also leaning into a familiar rivalry.\n\nAccording to NFL insider Jordan Schultz, the Miami Dolphins, now led by former Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, requested permission to interview Lions offensive assistant Bruce Gradkowski for their quarterbacks coach position. Dan Campbell reportedly blocked the request, making it clear that Gradkowski isn’t going anywhere.\n\nGiven Hafley’s Packers ties, the move feels especially fitting.\n\nDan Campbell and the Lions have spent years battling Green Bay for control of the NFC North, and now that a former Packers coordinator is running Miami, Detroit had little incentive to do any favors. Blocking the request not only keeps a valued coach in-house, it also denies help to a former rival.\n\nGradkowski has been with the Lions since 2025 and is viewed internally as a rising offensive mind. Before arriving in Detroit, he served as the offensive coordinator for the St. Louis BattleHawks of the UFL, helping build an offense that put him firmly on the NFL coaching radar.\n\nAs a player, Gradkowski starred at Toledo before being selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the sixth round of the 2006 NFL Draft. He went on to play for the St. Louis Rams, Cleveland Browns, Oakland Raiders, Cincinnati Bengals, and Pittsburgh Steelers, carving out a long professional career. His younger brother, Gino Gradkowski, is also a former NFL player.\n\nDetroit’s decision sends a clear message: Bruce Gradkowski is part of the Lions’ present — and future — and Dan Campbell isn’t about to help a former Packers coach rebuild elsewhere.\n\nThe post Report: Dan Campbell Sends Message by Blocking Dolphins’ Interview Request appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "description": "Discover George Washington Carver’s quiet lifelong passion for crochet and fancywork and download free crochet patterns for his swatches.",
    "fullText": "Most of us know George Washington Carver (about 1864–1943) as the famous African American agronomist from Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) who spent his career working to improve the lives of poor Southern farmers. But as a young man, Carver envisioned himself becoming a professional fine-art painter and enrolled in college as an art major in 1890. Because of his talent for painting flowers and plants and because of the well-established stereotype of a struggling artist, Carver’s art instructor convinced him to change his major to botany. Carver went on to dedicate his life to serving struggling rural families by teaching sustainable agricultural methods, introducing new crops and developing new markets for them. Still, Carver never abandoned his artistic interests, especially painting and crochet, continuing to pursue them as personal pastimes throughout his lifetime.\n\nGeorge Washington Carver had an unusual childhood. He was born near the end of the Civil War to Mary, an enslaved woman, whose owner, Moses Carver, didn’t approve of slavery (see note 1). Moses and three brothers had moved to Diamond Grove, Missouri, in 1838. It was near there that Moses and his wife, Susan, settled. When his widower brother Richard died shortly after arriving in Diamond Grove, Moses and Susan took in his three children, having none of their own. These children grew up helping with the farm work but by 1860 had moved out leaving an aging Moses and Susan with no help on a 240-acre farm. Hired help was scarce. Anyone with an interest in farming could just move a little farther west and homestead their own place. Moses was able to hire one man but couldn’t find help for Susan, so Moses resorted to buying Mary from a neighbor.\n\nThe Civil War was a lawless time in southwest Missouri. Shortly after George’s birth, raiders descended on the Carver farm and kidnapped Mary and George, probably with the intent of selling them to slave owners farther east. Moses hired John Bentley, a Union scout in nearby Neosho, to bring them back. Bentley found George abandoned by the kidnappers but didn’t find Mary. George had contracted whooping cough and was nearly dead when Bentley returned him. Susan nursed George back to health, but he was small and sickly throughout his childhood.\n\nWith the disappearance of Mary, Moses and Susan cared for the orphans—George and his half-brother, Jim. Jim, being older and of a rugged build, helped Moses with the heavier farm chores. George’s health concerns often left him confined to the house. He watched Susan do household chores and helped her when he could, becoming proficient in cooking, laundry, and needlework.\n\nGeorge Washington Carver standing in a plowed field, likely at the Tuskegee Institute, holding soil in 1906. Photo by Frances Benjamin Johnson, Booker T. Washington Collection. Courtesy of the Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division\n\nGeorge enjoyed needlework and pursued it as a pastime. As he stated in a 1931 letter to Isabelle Coleman, “If I had leisure time from roaming the woods and fields, I put it in knitting, crocheting, and other forms of fancy work (see note 2).” All of these skills he picked up at a young age (he only lived with the Carvers until he was eleven years old) and sometimes in the most unorthodox ways. George watched Susan knitting and decided he wanted to try. Apparently, Susan’s needles were either all in use or he wasn’t permitted to use them, so he stripped the barbs from two turkey feathers, leaving a little tuft at the tips. Then, he raveled the tops of an old mitten and sock, and he began knitting a strip with colored stripes (see note 3).\n\nGeorge found crochet even more fascinating than knitting. The Carvers were frugal, buying little in town except sugar and coffee, but the boys were allowed to take turns accompanying Moses on his twice-yearly trips to Neosho. George might be given a little spending money, and on one trip, he bought a steel and bone crochet hook (see note 4). George could barely read and had no pattern books, but he must have had some brief instruction combined with experimentation. Mariah Watkins, with whom Carver would board from age eleven to twelve, commented, “He could walk uptown and see a set of collar and cuffs on a woman’s dress, come home, and crochet the same (see note 5).”\n\nGeorge began his formal education at home. As George recalls in a 1922 letter, “Mr. and Mrs. Carver taught me to read, spell and write just a little” (see note 6) using a blue back speller, (see note 7) which was the only book in the Carver home. “From a child I had an inordinate desire for knowledge, and especially for music, painting, flowers and the sciences . . . Mr. and Mrs. Carver were very kind to me and I thank them so much for my home training. They encouraged me to secure knowledge helping me all they could, but this was quite limited. As we lived in the country no colored schools were available so I was permitted to go 8 miles to a school at town (Neosho)(see note 8).”\n\nStephen Frost, George’s Black teacher at the Neosho Colored School, had little more education than young George himself. George soon left Neosho seeking further education. For several years, he moved from one town to another through Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa, searching for schools with more advanced curriculums that would accept him. He supported himself and paid for school expenses with the domestic skills he had learned. “I had become more or less skilled in all kinds of homecrafts, such as cooking, laundrying [sic], and many kinds of fancy work. I found employment just as a girl (see note 9).”\n\nThe year 1889 found George Washington Carver, now a man in his late twenties, in Winterset, Iowa, opening a laundry. With the encouragement of friends in Winterset, Carver began saving money to once again enroll in school, this time at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, 25 miles away. Carver matriculated in 1890 studying art with the idea of becoming a fine-art painter, and his finest paintings were of flowers and plants. In spite of Carver’s obvious talent, Etta Budd, his painting instructor, was concerned about the challenges Carver would face in working as an artist. Etta’s father was Professor of Horticulture at Iowa Agricultural College (now Iowa State University), and the two of them convinced Carver to change his major to botany and enroll at Iowa Agricultural College, effectively ending Carver’s work as a professional domestic.\n\nLeft: Carver’s crochet work exhibited at the George Washington Carver Museum in 2007. Photo by Curtis Gregory. Right: In 1941, the George Washington Carver Museum held an opening of Carver’s crochet and other needlework. These photos and others by P. H. Polk, a noted Black photographer who served as head of the Photography Department at Tuskegee Institute, remain in the collection of Tuskegee University. Photos by P. H. Polk, courtesy of Tuskegee University\n\nCarver managed to find time to continue his painting and crochet despite his busy teaching and research schedule. He struck up a friendship with fellow teacher Mrs. Adella Logan. Adella had graduated from Atlanta University with a university’s broader, more worldly education. Like Carver, she had an interest in the arts. Adella admired Carver’s paintings and encouraged his artistic talents. A few years later, Sarah Hunt, Adella’s sister, also graduated from Atlanta University and came to teach at Tuskegee. The three of them frequently met for lunch and needlework.\n\nWhen looking at photographs taken of Carver’s 1941 crochet exhibit, we see crocheted items that consist mostly of elaborate edging swatches and a few doilies. In 2018, I had the opportunity to view Carver’s needlework collection located in the archives of the Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site. The crocheted pieces in the collection are those shown in the 1941 photos. About half of the pieces in the photos are still located in the archives. Nearly all of his crochet was thread/lace work.\n\nExamples of Carver’s crochet swatches remain in the George Washington Carver Museum in Tuskegee, Alabama. Photo by Curtis Gregor\n\nFor two reasons, I think all of these items were crocheted after Carver arrived at Tuskegee. First is the style. During the Victorian period (through 1901), crochet was commonly used for fashion accessories, such as miser purses, collar and cuff sets, gloves, and more. None of these items were in Carver’s collection. Second, doilies and elaborate edgings are always worked from a written pattern of some kind. There were few patterns before 1900, but by 1915, most women’s magazines included crochet patterns, and several needlework companies were producing copious numbers of pattern books. I have located at least a half dozen of the original patterns for Carver’s swatches in period publications.\n\nMost of Carver’s extant crochet consists of swatches and doilies, but that doesn’t mean that’s all he created. He crocheted his own neckties from threads treated with dyes he created in order to test colorfastness. He kept a few doilies in his apartment, others were used as gifts. He gave an intricate Irish crochet collar to a student. From objects including a filet swatch with the word “Baby” and another with little ducks, we can assume he crocheted baby gifts for expecting friends.\n\nWhile most of Carver’s crochet was for his personal enjoyment, he did create some crocheted pieces, such as the rag rug he is crocheting on page 18, as models for his rural outreach programs at the Tuskegee Institute’s agricultural experiment station. Carver’s experiment-station research focused on helping poor farming families establish alternative crops, improve health and nutrition, and boost household economics. Textiles in his experiment-station work relied on discarded materials, such as rags, old burlap bags, and waste plant fibers. Carver used these accessible materials to create useful and beautiful textiles. I look forward to sharing more about this work in an upcoming PieceWork article.\n\nAuthor’s Note: This article would not have been possible without the assistance of Curtis Gregory, Park Ranger, George Washington Carver National Monument, and Robyn Green Harris, Museum Specialist, Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site—and I thank them.\n\nNancy Nehring re-created some of Carver’s swatches in the Spring 2021 issue of PieceWork.

    "description": "(Removes 'downtown' from paragraph 2) By Ted Hesson, Kristina Cooke and Brad Heath WASHINGTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Becky Ringstrom was heading home after following federal immigration officers in her",
    "fullText": "(Removes 'downtown' from paragraph 2)\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Becky Ringstrom was heading home after following federal immigration officers in her gray Kia SUV in suburban Minneapolis when she was suddenly boxed in by unmarked vehicles. At least a half-dozen masked agents jumped out to arrest her, one knocking on her windshield with a metal object as if threatening to use it to break her window.\n\nAfter the arrest, captured on bystander video verified by Reuters, the 42-year-old mother of seven later said she was transported to Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis where an officer gave her a citation charging her under a ​federal law that criminalizes impeding law enforcement. The official said her name and photo would be added to a government database.\n\nThe arrest of Ringstrom became the latest detention of one of thousands of local activists for violating Title 18, Section 111 of the U.S. Code, a catch-all charge for anyone who “forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes” ‌with a federal officer conducting official duties. The statute can be charged as a felony or misdemeanor. As a felony, it carries up to 20 years in prison, but penalties beyond eight years are reserved for people who use “a deadly or dangerous weapon” or cause an injury.\n\nA Reuters review of federal court records found that the Trump administration has prosecuted at least 655 people under that charge across the U.S. since a series of city-focused immigration crackdowns began last summer. ‌That’s more than double the prosecutions during the same period in 2024-2025, according to a review of publicly available criminal filings in Westlaw, a legal research database owned by Thomson Reuters.\n\nThe charges are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to clamp down on ICE opponents, who they portray as rioters who pose threats to officers and undermine their efforts to arrest immigrants with criminal records.\n\n\"Assaulting and obstructing law enforcement is a felony,\" said U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. She said federal immigration officers \"used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property.\"\n\nICE has been tracking the names of protesters in an internal database for several months, according to two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operations.\n\nThe government database contains names, photos, actions that provoked suspicion, locations and license plates, the officials said, adding that the effort was intended to spot patterns that could lead to charges.\n\nDHS said ⁠it does not maintain a database of U.S. “domestic terrorists,” but does track threats. “We do of course monitor and investigate and refer all ‌threats, assaults and obstruction of our officers to the appropriate law enforcement,” McLaughlin said.\n\nOne of the officials said ICE was referring several people per day in Minnesota alone to federal prosecutors for potential charges under the same law for interfering with police operations.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the Trump administration was committed to protecting First Amendment freedoms, but that people impeding law enforcement \"will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nRingstrom had watched federal immigration officers for about 45 minutes as they sat in a parked car in her neighborhood on Thursday, January 29. When they started to ‍move, she decided to follow along in her SUV, keeping a distance of multiple car lengths behind, she said.\n\nAt a roundabout, a Border Patrol agent approached her car and said, \"Last time I'm going to warn you,\" according to video Ringstrom recorded on her phone.\n\nThe officers went right at a stop sign and she went left, she said. Several minutes later as she started to head back toward her house, multiple vehicles with federal officers stopped and arrested her, she said.\n\n\"I know what I'm doing is not wrong,\" Ringstrom said later in an interview with Reuters.\n\nStill, she said she was terrified when federal officers approached her car. “There was a moment where I thought I could be Renee Good,\" she said, referring to one of the two U.S. citizen protesters fatally shot by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis in January.\n\nAfter her arrest, she was issued a citation, reviewed by Reuters, ​which said the court date was “TBD” - to be determined.\n\nMcLaughlin said Ringstrom \"stalked law enforcement and attempted to obstruct law enforcement from performing their sworn duties.”\n\nSeth Stoughton, a professor focused on policing at University of South Carolina School of Law, said the law in the past mostly has been used to charge assaults on officers and specifically states that the alleged crime must be committed \"forcibly.”\n\n\"Without ‌any physical contact, just following an agent in a car, it's not clear to me that that's resistance or impeding in the first place, and it certainly seems like a stretch to establish that as forcible,\" Stoughton said.\n\nA federal judge in Minneapolis said in a mid-January order that a vehicle following ICE at “an appropriate distance” did not justify a traffic stop or arrest, but that order was paused by an appeals court 10 days later.\n\nThe judge’s now-paused order did not say what exact distance would be deemed safe.\n\nDeborah Fleischaker, a top ICE official under former President Joe Biden, said it was “inappropriate and unconstitutional” to intimidate and arrest people peacefully following immigration officers in their cars.\n\n“Observing ICE activities is not a crime and should not be treated as such,” she said.\n\nMcLaughlin said U.S. Border Patrol agents at the scene gave Ringstrom \"lawful commands and warnings\" but that she continued to obstruct operations, leading to her arrest.\n\n\"When agitators willingly involve themselves and inject themselves in law enforcement operations, they are risking arrest as well as jeopardizing the safety of themselves and those around them,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nVIDEOS SHOW ICE OFFICERS DRAWING WEAPONS\n\nWhile new internal ICE guidance, reported by Reuters in late January, instructed officers not to engage with protesters, the encounters have not stopped.\n\nTwo videos in recent weeks verified by Reuters showed ICE officers drawing their weapons as they approached vehicles that allegedly had been following them.\n\nSouth of Minneapolis on January 29, the same day Ringstrom was arrested, federal immigration officers abruptly swerved, stopped their vehicle and approached a woman driving behind them with guns drawn, according to dashcam footage ⁠from her vehicle first reported by Minnesota Public Radio and verified by Reuters.\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE officers were attempting to arrest a criminal offender when the woman began “stalking and obstructing” them, leading the officers to try to arrest ​her.\n\n“Law enforcement officers attempted to pull her over using their emergency lights to issue her a warning,” McLaughlin said. “Ignoring law enforcement commands, the agitator refused to pull over and began driving recklessly including running stop signs, nearly colliding with ​multiple vehicles, and driving directly at law enforcement in an attempt to ram their vehicle.”\n\nIn a separate incident on February 3, two ICE officers approached a car that had been following them, again, with guns drawn, according to video verified by Reuters and a DHS statement.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the vehicle had been “stalking” and “obstructing” ICE officers.\n\n“The agitators then followed the officers as they departed and made hand motions suggestive of possessing a firearm,” DHS said.\n\nUnder Trump, numerous DHS statements after violent encounters with immigration agents have been inaccurate ⁠or incomplete.\n\nSome Minnesota residents say they believe they are becoming the subject of an intimidation campaign.\n\nIn a suburb north of St. Paul on January 22, an ICE officer led a woman who was following his vehicle back to her house, making it clear that he knew her identity and address, Reuters-verified video filmed by the husband showed.\n\nThe woman’s husband spoke to the ICE officer outside of the couple’s house. When the husband questioned the tactic, the officer said, “You raise your voice, I erase your voice,” the video showed.\n\nOne ICE officer told Reuters they have led people following them back to their houses after running their license plates “to freak them out.”\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE would review body camera ⁠footage and investigate the incident in St. Paul, but did not comment on ICE using the tactic to frighten opponents.\n\nEarlier in January, two friends - Brandon Siguenza and Patty O’Keefe - who were following an ICE vehicle in Minneapolis said officers fired pepper spray into their car, smashed their car window and detained them for eight hours.\n\nMcLaughlin said officers gave them multiple warnings “to stop impeding” operations, but that they “chose to continue to stalk law enforcement and were arrested.”\n\n“The passenger refused to roll ‌down the window and exit the vehicle,” McLaughlin said. “ICE law enforcement followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to make the arrest.”\n\nMcLaughlin did not explicitly confirm that officers broke the car window or deployed pepper spray.\n\nSiguenza and O’Keefe have not been charged.",

The unit returned to playing up to traditional Giants standards, earning praise for its improved performance despite limited wins.\n\nBullen described serving as DC as a \"great honor and privilege,\" focusing on hard work and player development rather than external validation. His success drew widespread interest, including prior interview requests from the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals.\n\nUnder new Giants head coach John Harbaugh, Bullen was retained on staff -- amid a broader coaching purge -- but primarily as outside linebackers coach.\n\nTeams cannot block promotional interviews, positioning Bullen as a rising candidate for full-time coordinator opportunities.

Five days on, and around 4,700 supporters have donated over $520,000 to this page.\n\nThe GoFundMe, which launched just a few hours after company executives began cutting workers, was organized by Post reporter Rachel Siegel and other members of the newsroom's union.\n\nA separate GoFundMe page for the Post's international employees has also raised almost $200,000 with about 2,100 donations.\n\nAccording to the newsroom's union, the cut has affected hundreds of jobs at the organization.\n\nA spokesperson for The Washington Post told Business Insider that it \"is actively supporting employees impacted by last week's restructuring, including transition support for our international employees.\"\n\nPost owner and Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, has drawn significant criticism over his stewardship of the company in the last few days.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell refused to answer questions at a deposition before the U.S. House's Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Monday, according to lawmakers, ​drawing criticism from both Republican and Democratic members of the committee.\n\nMaxwell, who was found guilty in 2021 ‌for her role in helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence, invoked her Fifth Amendment ‌privilege against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions, lawmakers said after the deposition.\n\n\"This is obviously very disappointing. We had many questions to ask about the crimes she and Epstein committed, as well as questions about potential co-conspirators,\" the committee's chairman, Republican Representative James Comer, told reporters.\n\nDemocrats on the committee accused Maxwell of using the deposition to campaign for clemency ⁠from U.S. President Donald Trump and ‌called on the Republican president to rule out such a move.\n\n\"What we did not get were any substantive answers to the questions that were asked that would advance our ‍investigation,\" said Representative James Walkinshaw, a Virginia Democrat.\n\n\"What we did get was another episode in her long-running campaign for clemency from President Trump. And President Trump could end that today - he could rule out clemency for Ghislaine Maxwell, the monster.\"\n\nDavid Markus, a ​lawyer for Maxwell, said he advised her to invoke the Fifth Amendment as she has a pending ‌habeas petition \"that demonstrates that her conviction rests on a fundamentally unfair trial.\"\n\n\"If this Committee and the American public truly want to hear the unfiltered truth about what happened, there is a straightforward path. Ms. Maxwell is prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump,\" Markus said in a statement to the Committee posted on X on Monday.\n\nThe deposition came as the U.S. Department of Justice has released millions of internal documents ⁠related to Epstein.\n\nDocuments released include photos of Trump with several women ​whose faces are redacted and a suggestive note to Epstein, framed ​by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to bear Trump's signature.\n\nTrump has denied any knowledge of Epstein's crimes and says he broke off ties in the early 2000s, ‍before Epstein pleaded guilty in ⁠2008 to a Florida state prostitution charge. He says the suggestive note was faked.\n\nComer said that five more depositions were scheduled in the Epstein investigation, including on February 26 with former U.S. Secretary of ⁠State Hillary Clinton and on February 27 with former U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\nMarkus said in the post on X that Trump and ‌Bill Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing, adding that Maxwell can explain why.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Wednesday about American talks with Iran, his office said Saturday, while Iran's foreign minister threatened U.S. military bases in the region a day after the discussions.\n\n“The prime minister believes that all negotiations must include limiting the ballistic missiles, and ending support for the Iranian axis,” Netanyahu’s office said in a brief statement, referring to Tehran's support for militant groups, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories. Trump and Netanyahu last met in December.\n\nThere was no immediate White House comment.\n\nThe U.S. and the Islamic Republic of Iran held indirect talks on Friday in Oman that appeared to return to the starting point on how to approach discussions over Tehran’s nuclear program.\n\nTrump called the talks “very good” and said more were planned for early next week. Washington was represented by Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear program after sending the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other warships to the region amid Tehran’s crackdown on nationwide protests that killed thousands.\n\nGulf Arab nations fear an attack could spark a regional war, with memories fresh of the 12-day Israel-Iran war in June.\n\nFor the first time in negotiations with Iran, the U.S. on Friday brought its top military commander in the Middle East to the table. U.S. Navy Adm. Brad Cooper, head of the military’s Central Command, then visited the USS Abraham Lincoln on Saturday with Witkoff and Kushner, the command said in a statement.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told journalists Friday that “nuclear talks and the resolution of the main issues must take place in a calm atmosphere, without tension and without threats.” He said that diplomats would return to their capitals, signaling that this round of negotiations was over.\n\nOn Saturday, Araghchi told the Al Jazeera satellite news network that if the U.S. attacks Iran, his country doesn't have the ability to strike the U.S. “and therefore has to attack or retaliate against U.S. bases in the region.”\n\nHe said there is “very, very deep distrust” after what happened during the previous talks, when the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during last year's Israel-Iran war.\n\nAraghchi also said the “missile issue” and other defense matters are “in no way negotiable, neither now nor at any time in the future.”\n\nTehran has maintained that these talks will be only on its nuclear program.\n\nHowever, Al Jazeera reported that diplomats from Egypt, Turkey and Qatar offered Iran a proposal in which Tehran would halt enrichment for three years, send its highly enriched uranium out of the country and pledge to “not initiate the use of ballistic missiles.”\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the talks needed to include all those issues.\n\nIsrael, a close U.S. ally, believes Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon and wants its program scrapped, though Iran has insisted that its atomic plans are for peaceful purposes. Israel also wants a halt to Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for militant groups in the region.\n\nAraghchi, speaking at a forum in Qatar on Saturday, accused Israel of destabilizing the region, saying that it “breaches sovereignties, it assassinates official dignitaries, it conducts terrorist operations, it expands its reach in multiple theaters.” He criticized Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and called for “comprehensive and targeted sanctions against Israel, including an immediate arms embargo.”",

    "fullText": "Trent Perry scored 23 points, including clutch free throws down the stretch, Tyler Bilodeau overcame foul trouble to score 19, Donovan Dent had 17 points and 10 assists and Eric Dailey Jr. scored 14 as UCLA held off Washington 77-73 Saturday night in a Big Ten clash at Pauley Pavilion.\n\nAhead of a pivotal Midwest trip to No. 2 Michigan and No. 10 Michigan State starting on Valentine's Day, the Bruins wrapped up their three-game homestand on a positive note after splitting the first two, a one-point, double-overtime loss to Indiana followed by a 22-point blowout of Rutgers in which five players scored in double digits.\n\nThe Bruins (17-7, 9-4) struggled against Washington much as they did in the teams’ first meeting Dec. 3 in Seattle, when they escaped with an 82-80 victory thanks to 25 points (including six three-pointers) by Skyy Clark, who has sat out the past 10 games with a hamstring injury.\n\nA winner in 10 of its last 14 games, UCLA will not host its next game until a Feb. 21 matchup with fifth-ranked Illinois.\n\nWesley Yates III scored 12 of the Huskies’ first 16 points as they built an eight-point lead in the first eight minutes. The Bruins pulled ahead 25-23 on Perry’s three pointer with 6:15 left in the half that capped a 9-0 run, but Washington carried a 34-30 lead to the locker room — the first time UCLA trailed at halftime since its loss at Ohio State on Jan. 17.\n\nBilodeau, who scored only four points in the first 20 minutes, hit a three pointer 10 seconds into the second half and added another to tie the score at 38. Dent stole the ball at midcourt and drove for a layup to put UCLA in front 47-45 with 13:43 remaining and the Bruins gradually increased the lead while holding the Huskies without a field goal for nearly five minutes.\n\nWashington crept to within 60-58 with 5:39 left on a layup by Yates before Bilodeau’s basket and free throw restored a five-point cushion at the 4:40 mark. Dent’s driving layup made it 67-60 with 1:33 left and the Bruins improved to 13-3 when winning the turnover battle.\n\nYates finished with 21 points and Hannes Steinbach added 13 for the Huskies (12-12, 4-9), who cut their deficit to two on a layup and free throw by Yates with 23 seconds left. Dailey got fouled and made both shots to make it 75-71 with 21 ticks left. After a layup by Yates with 11 seconds left, Perry sank two free throws to ice the victory four seconds later.\n\nThe Bruins were 23 of 29 at the foul line and remain on pace to break the school single-season record for best free throw percentage (75.6) set in 1978-79.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The world's fourth-richest man promised to save the Washington Post. Time for him to step up and do it.",
    "fullText": "Will Lewis, the former CEO and publisher of the Washington Post, had a terrible tenure at the paper. The two years he spent there, which ended Saturday with a two-paragraph memo, are chiefly notable for a series of cuts and layoffs, culminating in a 30% bloodletting days ago.\n\nBut let's be clear: This one is on Jeff Bezos.\n\nMost obviously, that's because Bezos owns the Post, and Bezos was the one who hired Lewis to run the business for him.\n\nBezos was also the one signing off on Lewis's actions at the paper, which mostly amounted to making the paper smaller while telling the staff that \"people are not reading your stuff.\"\n\nAnd slightly less obviously, it was Bezos who dramatically worsened the Post's business outlook. He decided not to endorse a presidential candidate in 2024, weeks before the election — a move that outraged many Post readers, who saw the non-endorsement as an attempt to cater to Donald Trump.\n\nThat led to more than 250,000 subscriber cancellations, a huge problem for a paper whose circulation peaked at 3 million in 2021.\n\nThe best case argument you could make for Lewis era at the Post, if you are inclined, would go something like this: Bezos, who bought the Post in 2013 and then invested heavily in staff, realized a few years ago that he now employed many more people than his business would support. So he brought Lewis in to do the grim work of shrinking the publication. Now that work is done, so Lewis can do something else and Bezos can find someone to help the Post grow again.\n\nBut the timing of Lewis' departure — late afternoon on a Saturday, following days of howling from Post employees and many others about Lewis and Bezos' stewardship of the paper — suggests this was not a long-in-the-making move.\n\nAnd again, whether Lewis jumped or was pushed doesn't matter in the end. The Washington Post is Jeff Bezos. He gets praise if things are going well — which, for several years after his purchase, seemed to be the case — and blame when it doesn't.\n\nHere I'll also point out that Bezos, who has no problem being seen jet-setting around the world in a style befitting the world's fourth-richest man, has been totally MIA during his paper's recent turmoil.\n\nOn Saturday, when the paper announced it had promoted Post CFO Jeff D'Onofrio to acting publisher and CEO, Bezos finally attached his name to a public statement, promising that the new Post would thrive by giving readers things they wanted to read.\n\n\"The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus,\" he said in a Post press release.\n\nThat might qualify for an insight 30 years ago, when newspapers were struggling to respond to the internet. Now that's table stakes, and you would hope the guy who created Amazon has more up his sleeve.\n\n\"I have a bunch of ideas,\" for the Post, Bezos said in the fall of 2024. \"I'm working on that right now.\"",

But it's not too late to save The Post. Jeff Bezos must immediately rescind these layoffs or sell the paper to someone willing to invest in its future.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the Post union did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOn social media, laid-off reporters celebrated the news of Lewis' departure. Jada Yuan, a former culture writer at the Post, wrote that she had \"never been more thrilled with a news alert.\"\n\n\"Will Lewis, the absent, ineffective publisher of @washingtonpost has resigned. Or been fired,\" she added. \"It sucks that it happened after he couldn't even show up on zoom to lay off 1/3 of the company. But the important thing is he's gone.\"\n\nLewis' exit was announced Saturday afternoon, just days after sweeping layoffs hit the legacy publication, leaving hundreds of reporters out of work.\n\nThe publication's unionized employees held a \"Save the Post\" rally earlier this week, focused on Bezos and Lewis, and said there were risks to press freedom and independent news if legacy publications like the Post are unable to continue operating.",

    "description": "Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos has put out his first statement since the paper's cuts. He said \"data tells us what is valuable and where to focus.\"",
    "fullText": "Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos gave his first public statement since the paper enacted massive job cuts this week, and it focused on \"data\" and understanding reader interests.\n\nThe billionaire Amazon founder, who built one of the world's most valuable companies with a relentless focus on customer satisfaction, indicated he wanted to see that same energy at the Post.\n\n\"The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity,\" Bezos wrote. \"Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus.\"\n\nBezos' statement came as Post CEO Will Lewis announced he was stepping down, to be replaced in an interim capacity by Post CFO Jeff D'Onofrio.\n\nIn his own statement, D'Onofrio said that \"customer data will drive our decisions, sharpening our edge in delivering what is most valuable to our audiences.\"\n\nBezos and D'Onofrio's statements struck a similar tone to comments made by the paper's top editor, Matt Murray, in addressing staff earlier this week.\n\n\"Today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people's lives in what has become a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,\" Murray said during a staff call on Wednesday. \"For too long, we've operated with a structure that's too rooted in the days when we were a quasi-monopoly local newspaper.\"\n\nFollowing the layoffs, Murray spoke repeatedly about focusing on areas of reader interest and understanding audience data in an appearance on the Puck podcast \"The Grill Room.\"\n\nHe said that when he was brought on, he felt the company hadn't \"fully embraced the digital internet revolution the right way.\"\n\nHe added that the company had a \"long way to go in using data — data to inform what we wrote, data to inform how we publish, data to understand our audience, data to understand our readers, data to understand our prospects.\"\n\nThe outspoken focus on data from Post leadership has drawn some criticism.\n\n\"'Customer data' is what has replaced 'focus group' for the same type of folks who pretty much killed Sports Illustrated by stamping out its originality and magnetism in favor of formulaic swill,\" The Atlantic's Sally Jenkins, formerly of the Post, wrote Saturday on X.\n\nStill, the messaging from Post leadership could help appease some critics who have seen management moves in recent years as rooted in political ideology and not data — though it will be difficult to win them over.\n\nThe Post faced a revolt both inside the newsroom and among readers when Bezos made a late-hour call in 2024 that the paper wouldn't endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in 36 years. NPR reported that more than 200,000 subscriptions were canceled in the days following.\n\nThe paper faced another round of criticism in February 2025 when Bezos decided to reorient the Post's opinion section — generally considered the owner's prerogative — around personal liberties and free markets.\n\nFormer Post executive editor Martin Baron, who worked closely with Bezos during his tenure atop the paper, wrote in a LinkedIn post after the layoffs that the Post's challenges had been made \"infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nCritics of Bezos' moves have said he should consider financially supporting the paper, given its role in society.\n\n\"It just seems heartbreaking that he doesn't feel the paper is important enough to bankroll,\" Sally Quinn, the longtime journalist and widow of former Post executive editor, Ben Bradlee, said this week on CNN.\n\nBezos said in his statement that he felt the Post's leadership going forward could build an \"exciting and thriving next chapter\" for the paper.",

The institution could not have a better owner.\n\nDuring my tenure, difficult decisions have been taken in order to ensure the sustainable future of The post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news to millions of customers each day.\n\n\"The Washington Post is announcing Jeff D'Onofrio as its acting Publisher and CEO, effective immediately.\n\nD'Onofrio, a strategic business leader and proven architect of the new media landscape, joined The Post in June 2025 as Chief Financial Officer following leadership roles across global companies including Raptive, Tumblr, Yahoo and Google.

    "fullText": "Will Lewis is out as chief executive at the Washington Post, days after sweeping layoffs hit the legacy publication and following a rocky two-year tenure that saw the Post struggle to stabilize its business.\n\nThe newspaper said Saturday that Jeff D'Onofrio, CFO, would serve as the interim CEO and publisher, effective immediately.\n\nLewis's departure comes after hundreds of Washington Post journalists were laid off across the company this week, in what executive editor Matt Murray described in a memo as part of a strategic reset. The cuts were felt across the newsroom, including the sports section, international, books, DC metro, and audio.\n\nAs news of the layoffs spread, Lewis came under widespread public criticism, both for the financial challenges at the Post and for not participating in the dissemination of the news. After Murray made the staff-cut announcements himself, Lewis was seen attending Super Bowl festivities.\n\nIn a note Saturday, Lewis said \"now is the right time for me to step aside\" and thanked Jeff Bezos, the paper's owner.\n\nD'Onofrio, who joined the Post in June 2025, said in an email to staffers on Saturday: \"This is a challenging time across all media organizations, and The Post is unfortunately no exception.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "fullText": "Last week, all sixteen clubs were gathered and represented for the second ever NWSL Media Day ahead of the 2026 regular season.\n\nHere are All For XI’s top moments from the 2026 NWSL Media Day:\n\nBay FC’s Jordan Silkowitz dream 2025 season\n\nA year ago, Silkowitz questioned whether she would continue playing the game at all. Today, she is Bay FC’s undisputed starter, one of the NWSL’s top-performing goalkeepers, and living out her childhood dream with the USWNT.\n\nFor more on her incredible journey, here is our latest feature.\n\nSan Diego Wave midfielder Kenza Dali isn’t sure she’ll ever quit football.\n\nHeading into her 17th professional season, the 34-year-old carries the same love for the game she felt on Day One.\n\n“You know what, it’s funny, because I’m the fittest on the team,” Dali said. “(Wave head coach Jonas Eidevall) can tell you. I look at age in terms of experience. You can’t match that. There are things in football you don’t learn on the pitch — you learn them through moments.”\n\nFull feature can be found here 🙂\n\nPortland Thorns forward Reilyn Turner just made her USWNT debut and scored her first ever goal too.\n\nShe talks to us about finding out that she had made the senior national team for the first time.\n\n“It’s a dream come true. I honestly thought it (email) was spam.”\n\nWhy Avery Patterson plays soccer\n\nUSWNT and Houston Dash defender Avery Patterson spoke about the now-stable culture she feels has been developed with the Houston Dash. The players have culture meetings with the coach every week, and speak with sports psychologists answering questions like, “Why do we play soccer?” At the end of our conversation Patterson answered exactly that question.\n\nPaige Cronin (née Monaghan) shares what being the captain and leader of Utah Royals means to her.\n\n“At first, I was scared,” said Cronin. “I’ve never done this before. For me I put a lot of pressure on myself, I try to listen to others, figure it all out. But, I think I learned through the highs and the lows.”\n\nMust Watch: Her sister’s reaction is incredible\n\nUSWNT and North Carolina Courage midfielder Riley Jackson shares her excitement to finding out she made the senior team for the first time, her sister’s hilarious reaction, and her first ever goal contribution – an assist to Trinity Rodman.\n\nRookie of the Year finalist on her storybook season\n\nAngel City FC forward Riley Tiernan talks about her special rookie season and if she’s had a chance to take in all of the wonderful success from it.\n\n“I was not expecting any of this coming out of college. It’s everything I’ve worked for. It’s something I’ve been working towards my whole life. But, to see it all fall into place and to get these small and big accomplishments has been really special.”\n\n“I would say I’m still digesting, the fact that I’m living in the best place in the world, doing what I love to do for a job.”\n\nEmeri Adames is very serious about her national holiday idea\n\nSeattle Reign forward Emeri Adames reveals her idea for a national holiday, and you better like it!\n\n“I would do National Pickle Day because I love pickles so much. I think everyone should like pickles. And when they say they don’t like pickles, it makes me mad.”\n\nSan Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley reveals while at Target, she found out that she had made the USWNT.\n\n“It was really exciting. I had gotten an email but I don’t check it as frequently as I should. So I was a little bit late, but I saw it when I was with my mom at Target. We were both through the roof, very surprised, very full of excitement and gratitude.”\n\n2025 NWSL Midfielder of the Year\n\nNorth Carolina Courage star Manaka Matsukubo shares what it means to be honored with that award and gives plenty of love to her teammates and family.\n\n“I am honored. However, it’s not just me, it’s my teammates.”\n\nWashington Spirit and USWNT forward, and California native Trinity Rodman talks her excitement about playing at home for the 2028 LA Olympics.\n\n“It always is like this full-circle moment because I grew up here and I started playing soccer down here.”\n\n“I’m so excited. I’m going to have a lot of people, so I better start getting tickets ready for it.”\n\nJordyn Bloomer stole the show in the NWSL in 2025 and will be a player to look out for this season as well.\n\nHowever, her journey has been filled with adversity, patience, and so much more, but she has gotten past all of it. Now, she is shining brighter than ever.\n\nThe goalkeeper discussed her unique journey with us.\n\nCalifornia native Onyeka Gamero shares what it means to be coming back to her home state and join the NWSL.\n\n“I remember saying, ‘I want to be back in the U.S., I’ll go anywhere.’ But of course being in California – my parents right there, everything is so familiar.”\n\n“It just feels nice. I feel good. For me as a player, I feel like that’s where it starts, just feeling ok.”\n\nWashington Spirit star midfielder Croix Bethune shares some of the key details from her conversation with USWNT head coach Emma Hayes.\n\nCasey Murphy made a big move to the Boston Legacy joining as a free agent goalkeeper. One of the reasons she gave at NWSL media day was the titles. Boston is a city that notoriously cares deeply about their sports. Mistakes can linger in the minds of players and fans with the pressure, here’s what Murphy had to say on the matter.\n\nDid Utah Royals forward Mina Tanaka come up with the greatest holiday ever?",

    "title": "Cowboys news: Jerry Jones praises new DC Christian Parker",
    "description": "Check out the latent news involving the Dallas Cowboys.",
    "fullText": "Christian Parker has impressed Jerry Jones immensely.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he was impressed with new defensive coordinator Christian Parker’s ability to teach and the flexibility of the defensive scheme.\n\nJones made his first comments about Parker during a wide-ranging conversation with a small group of reporters Thursday night before the NFL Honors show.\n\nWhen it comes to Parker, the youngest defensive coordinator in franchise history at 34, Jones said his communication skills were also important.\n\n“I like his focus on being a teacher, educating and his emphasis on that mental aspect of football,” Jones said. “He obviously got a lot of physical emphasis, too. In general, I’m excited about the makeup of our entire defensive group. They’re younger to my knowledge right now, unless it was a high school level, I don’t think we have a head coach in the group. There may be before we totally finalize. I’m very much aware that whatever we did before in our decision-making, we’re going a different way.”\n\nThe three-time Super Bowl champion will have to wait at least one more year.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO – Just because something has happened four years in a row, doesn’t make it any easier.\n\nThat’s feeling Darren Woodson can speak to as he was once again left of the ballot for the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class.\n\nA finalist for the fourth straight year, Woodson is now getting used to coming this close to the doorstep of the football immortality, but not getting his name called … again.\n\nBut if you think it’s going to change his attitude about the process, or maybe force him to change his strategy in how he promotes himself or doesn’t … think again.\n\nBasically, Woodson says his 12-year career, the Super Bowls, the Pro Bowls and all the tackles in between, should speak for itself. It just hasn’t yet to the voters.\n\n“You can look back and look at what I did,” Woodson said of his career. “I’m not going to campaign and do these little things to bring attention to me. I’ve never been that way and I’m not going to do that. So when it doesn’t happen … I’ve been built all my entire life that the birds are going to chirp the next day and I’m going to run my businesses the next day. Life is going to go on. Do I want it? Yeah, of course, but it’s not going to break me.”\n\nWhile Woodson’s biggest supporters seem upset with the voting process, Woodson doesn’t ever allow himself to go there.\n\n“You know, I don’t take shots at the voting process… I just don’t,” Woodson said. “There’s just a code of the process at hand. Like, you get a call and they tell you, you made it or didn’t make it. You basically just adhere to that code. Whoever does get int, they should be honored. It should be there. Its not about the guys going it. If you don’t get in, it sucks. But you still honor the guys who did make it. We should be celebrating those guys.”\n\nThe former third-round pick could flourish under new defensive leadership.\n\nChristian Parker’s arrival is a direct force multiplier for Shavon Revel Jr. because Parker’s calling card isn’t just scheme, it’s year-over-year, detail-driven defensive back development. Dallas’ own decision-makers have already framed the hire in exactly those terms. They wanted a teacher, and Revel was one of the first young defensive backs names highlighted internally which matters because it tells fans how the building views Revel’s ceiling and why Parker was targeted to get him there.\n\nThe most concrete evidence point is what Parker’s secondaries produced in Philadelphia. In 2024, the Eagles finished best in the league with an elite pass-defense allowing 2,961 passing yards on 62.2% completions, along with 22 passing touchdowns allowed, and an 82.5 opponent passer rating. Then in 2025, the Eagles followed that up finishing top-10 with 3,226 opponent passing yards, a 56.8% opponent completion rate, and most notably just 14 opponent passing touchdowns allowed with a 75.4 opponent passer rating, all best in the league. Put simply, Parker’s track record says corners don’t just look better on tape, the unit measurably suppresses completions, explosive throws, and red-zone passing results.\n\nFor Revel specifically, Parker’s fit is good because Revel’s 2026 improvement path is mostly about technique, timing, and confidence. The exact areas that tend to jump on a defensive backs second offseason. Revel’s ACL timeline is a key part of why 2026 is a big year, he returned to action in 2025 after a torn ACL and only debuted midseason, which almost always means players in this situation are playing catch-up on lower-body confidence.\n\nGeorge Pickens staying with the Cowboys seems like a foregone conclusion.\n\nLosing Micah Parsons was a big blow for the Dallas Cowboys defense last year, but Jerry Jones continues to spin the trade as a positive.\n\nJones used some of the draft capital gained in the Parsons trade to acquire defensive tackle Quinnen Williams. He still has a first round pick to use from that trade as well, which is expected to be used on a defensive player.\n\nIn addition to these moves, Jones also has more room under the salary cap. Dallas already extended DaRon Bland and Tyler Smith, but they’re not done yet. According to Jones, they have the freedom to do whatever they need to now, including working out an extension with George Pickens.\n\nJones was asked if he believed the Cowboys could sign Pickens, even though fellow receiver CeeDee Lamb is already making an average of $34 million per season.\n\n“Absolutely. A lot of the reasons I did some of things that I did last year was to retain some players that if it would have gone in different directions I couldn’t have done it,” Jones said.\n\nPickens is scheduled for free agency and while the Cowboys can use the franchise tag, an extension would be preferable. Not only would that keep Pickens happy, but his contract could be spread out over the next several years rather than taking an estimated $28.1 million hit in 2026.",

I’d come across it in a magazine, and then earnestly set about training teams of creatures, transferring them between my Pokémon Red Game Boy cartridge and the 3D arenas of Pokémon Stadium on the Nintendo 64. I never made it as a player but I did finally achieve this dream on my 26th birthday, when I went to Washington DC to cover the world championships as a journalist. I was deeply moved. Presided over by a giant inflatable Pikachu hanging from the ceiling, the competitors and spectators were united in an unselfconscious love for these games, with their colourful menageries and heartfelt messaging about trust, friendship and hard work.\n\nIt is emotional to see the winners lift their trophies after a tense final round of battles, as overwhelmed by their success as any sportsperson. But it’s the pride that the smaller competitors’ parents show in their mini champions that really gets to me. During the first wave of Pokémania in the late 90s, Pokémon was viewed with suspicion by most adults. Now that the first generation of Pokémaniacs have grown up, even becoming parents ourselves, we see it for what it is: an imaginative, challenging and really rather wholesome series of games that rewards every hour that children devote to it.\n\nOver the three decades since the original Red and Blue (or Green, in Asia) versions of the video game were released in Japan in 1996, Pokémon has earned a place among the greats of children’s fiction. Like Harry Potter, the Famous Five and Narnia, it offers a powerful fantasy of self-determination, set in a world almost totally free of adult supervision. In every game, your mother sends you out into the world with a rucksack and a kiss goodbye; after that, it’s all on you.\n\nLike The Simpsons, Pokémon is a kind of cultural shorthand for the millennial generation. More than Mario, Zelda or any other Nintendo creation, Pokémon brings people together. It was designed from the beginning to be a social game, encouraging (and indeed necessitating) that players traded and battled with each other to complete their collection of virtual creatures and train their teams up into super-squads. Today, the internet has entirely normalised the idea of video games as social activities, but in the late 90s this was a novel idea. You can’t play Pokémon without other people: in 1999, that meant huddling in the playground, using a cable to link your Game Boys together; later, in 2016, at the height of the Pokémon Go phenomenon, it meant hundreds of people converging improbably at the same park with their phones to catch a Gengar.\n\nPokémon is often thought of as a turn-of-the-century fad, so it might be surprising to learn that it brings in more money now than it ever did at the height of its first wave of popularity. It has become the highest-grossing entertainment franchise of all time: between the TV series, the merchandise, the trading cards, the games and everything else adorned with the adorable faces of Pikachu and pals, the franchise has brought in north of $100bn, more than Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThis global phenomenon has its roots in Machida, a city on the outskirts of Tokyo, where Pokémon’s creator Satoshi Tajiri was born in 1965. Like many Japanese children in the 60s and 70s, little Satoshi collected bugs, becoming such an expert that his elementary school classmates referred to him as Dr Bug. As a teenager a new obsession arrived: video games, then just making their way into Japanese arcades. His enthusiasm was such that he started putting together a monthly zine, with his friend Ken Sugimori, called Game Freak – later the name of the video game development company they founded together, which still adorns the title screens of modern Pokémon games.\n\nThe idea for Pokémon began to percolate for Tajiri around 1990. Watching people link their Game Boys together with cables to play Tetris, the hit puzzle game, he envisioned the bugs he’d collected crawling between the consoles. But it took six long years for this idea to transform into a monochrome world full of 151 collectible critters, in chunky black Game Boy pixels. During this time the developer nearly went bust several times, taking on projects for Nintendo and other game developers to keep afloat; Tajiri regularly went without a salary.\n\nPokémon’s astronomical success wasn’t instant, but the result of slow-burning sales over years. When it eventually came out in 1996, Pocket Monsters Red and Green – as they were known in Japan – were indie underdogs, made by a tiny team with limited technology for the ageing handheld Game Boy console. Nobody expected it to be much of a hit, but the world of Pokémon Blue has an unexpected sense of place that transcends their technical limitations. The symbiotic relationship between humans, nature and Pokémon permeates every aspect of life, and is often quite touching – particularly at in-game locations such as Lavender Town, where the mourning owners of dead Pokémon come to honour them at a giant commemorative tower.\n\nBut the real marketable genius of Pokémon was the fact that the game came in different versions. The reason that Pokémon games always come in pairs is that different monsters reside in each cartridge. If you want to collect them all, to complete your Pokédex field guide, you need to trade them. Creatures could be sent between cartridges, so friends with different versions of the game could help each other accumulate covetable creatures. With Tetris, the Game Boy’s link cable was used for competition. Here it was used for connection.\n\nPokémon’s popularity spread through playground word-of-mouth. By the time it arrived in the US in 1998, and Europe in 1999, it was already a franchise: Pikachu-adorned games, TV shows, toys, films and lunchboxes, were rolled out carefully by marketers with a proven playbook.\n\nToday, Tajiri is a reclusive figure. Almost everything we know about him comes from a single 1999 interview with Time magazine. The tone of Time’s piece is shockingly dismissive. Declaring the series “a pestilential Ponzi scheme” it describes the “delinquent” and “criminal” behaviour of young Pokémon fans, and the moral bankruptcy of the whole craze – which, it comforts, is likely to peter out soon, like it did for the Power Rangers.\n\nNow that Pokémon has become one of the most enduring and successful entertainment properties of all time, this alarmist attitude seems ridiculous. But the scaremongering was very real. Some of this was simply older people failing to understand the new thing that the kids were into. But there was also an alarmingly xenophobic flavour to the moral panic, this scary Japanese thing with its sinister monsters coming over the seas to captivate children. Christian pastors in the US were proclaiming Pikachu to be a demon. There were movements to ban the TV show from airing.\n\nPerhaps understandably, given the disrespectful and, presumably, hurtful tone of that Time interview, and the moral panic that Pokémania unwittingly ignited, Satoshi Tajiri has shunned the limelight ever since. Now 60, he remains at Game Freak and is still involved in the creation of each new Pokémon game (as of 2025, there are 38 in total), though he reportedly stepped back from day-to-day development in 2012.\n\nJuly 2016 saw the launch of Pokémon Go, a mobile game that quickly became the most popular in US history, with 232 million players across the world. Pokémon Go works kind of like magic. With the app open, you walk around your neighbourhood; on your phone screen, you see a map of your real surroundings, with icons showing where Pokémon might be found. When you encounter a creature it is superimposed on your real surroundings, a Gengar posing casually in your local park. From there you simply flick a Pokéball at the creatures to capture them.\n\nThere’s a unique aspect too to Pokémon Go that makes it different to every other video game-related phenomenon I’ve witnessed. Most of the time when we talk about how games can help people through hard times, we talk about escapism: how virtual worlds can be a reprieve from the problems of the real one. But Pokémon Go was not so much about escapism as connection, a continuation of the lineage of those first games decades before.\n\nAt its height, it connected its players with their local area and the people around them. For a few months, there we were, all looking at our surroundings through a different lens, thinking that there might be a little bit of magic out there in the world, like a bug hiding under a rock.\n\nDr Bug may not be as involved as before, but the pastoral nature he instilled in Pokémon has persisted throughout the last 30 years: the interrelationships between people and Pokémon form the touching core of the games, movies and TV shows, and there is even a quasi-environmentalist bent to its stories. This is, after all, a game about evolution and living in harmony with the natural world. There is a resonance with nature that prevents this $100bn franchise from feeling nakedly cynical or exploitative. Pokémon’s story speaks to an important truth about video games: they are a powerful vector for connection between people. Millions are united by these imaginary creatures, born from one boy’s love of the natural world.\n\nSuper Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun by Keza MacDonald is published by Guardian Faber.

    "title": "I asked an insider what went wrong at Jeff Bezos' Washington Post",
    "description": "After Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013, the billionaire was considered a model owner. Not anymore. I asked an insider what happened.",
    "fullText": "Lots of people are angry at Jeff Bezos because of the massive cuts he's ordered at his Washington Post. But a decade ago, Bezos was widely celebrated for his ownership of the Post, which he had bought for $250 million in 2013.\n\nUnder Bezos' ownership, the Post made huge investments in tech and staff. And readers loved the results — especially during the first Trump era, when the paper turned profitable.\n\nNow things are very different: The Post says it has been losing gobs of money for the past few years, and Bezos has made a series of moves interpreted as a shift toward Trump — which spurred reader revolts, which made things even worse. And all of that led to this week's cuts.\n\nI talked to Erik Wemple, a New York Times media reporter who previously worked at the Post for 14 years, to try to reconcile the two eras of Bezos and the Post, and to get a sense of what might happen next. You can hear our entire chat on my Channels podcast; what follows is an edited excerpt from our conversation.\n\nPeter Kafka: What shape was the Post in when Bezos bought it in 2013?\n\nErik Wemple: The Graham family, which had owned the Post forever, was an amazing steward for the paper. But they had to scale back their newsroom, because the internet had blown holes in classified ads. Classifieds used to be huge at The Washington Post.\n\nAt the time Bezos bought it in 2013, it was not dysfunctional. These were really good journalists, but the paper was in a bit of a funk. It wasn't a reclamation project, but it had seen better days.\n\nIt was faded when he bought it.\n\nCorrect. And when Bezos came in 2013, he really wowed the staff. We all asked him questions. He answered those questions with tremendous enthusiasm and competence. He seemed really energized by this.\n\nWhat did he think he was going to do?\n\nWhen he came in, he was energetic, but deferential on the particulars of running the newspaper. He's like, \"You know what? I'm not in this business, but I do know how to organize discussions about the future of a business.\" And that's what he did. I was in one of them; it was really remarkable.\n\nHe had these things that he believed in. He was important in guiding conversations. And it was really remarkable because he backed it up with money. He invested in the newspaper. He invested in political coverage, big time. Investigative went up. International got a huge, huge boost. And the technology did too.\n\nThis is exactly what you want from your billionaire tech owner: Give us a bunch of money. Improve our tech. Also, stay away. Don't tell us what to do.\n\nThat was exactly the sentiment. And one of the things you mentioned in there is really worth pausing on for a second, which is the lack of intervention, the lack of meddling. He just sort of looked on. And the newsroom really, really, really roared. Especially in the first Trump period.\n\nSo not only does this produce great journalism, it seems like it becomes a business success story — the paper becomes profitable again. Then, after Trump left the White House, there was a lot of hand-wringing about what happens after the Trump bump. People expected audiences to decline across lots of different publications, and that happened, so it makes sense that the Post would struggle a bit. But the numbers you hear about the reported losses — $77 million in 2023, $100 million in 2024 — are staggering. I still don't understand how you can swing to losses like that just because your traffic goes down. What am I missing?\n\nOne of the things that has been reported and pretty well substantiated is they may have over-indexed on staff growth. They vaulted up over a thousand in early 2021, up to 1,100. So I think they got ahead of themselves, and they had to pair that back. That's one of the things.\n\nAnother consideration is that the digital advertising market sort of dried up, so that was a big deal.\n\nIt's all somewhat of a mystery, but I don't doubt that there are meaningful losses.\n\nCan this just be as simple as the Post overhiring? Lots of companies have done that — the tech guys did during the pandemic.\n\nNo, I don't think so. Especially if you look at the more recent past, when they tinkered with the opinion side and shot themselves in the foot.\n\nIn October 2024, the Post announced it would not be endorsing a candidate in the presidential election. And that happened after the Washington Post editorial board had drafted an editorial in favor of Kamala Harris. And hell broke loose — a subscription desertion of hundreds of thousands.\n\nThat's an astonishing number. I remember thinking that it couldn't be real.\n\nThe cause and effect could not have been more direct. People said, \"No way. I'm not giving my money to this organization.\"\n\nThe Post has continued to do lots of news reporting that is critical of the Trump administration. Which made me curious about this line in editor Matt Murray's explanation of the cuts this week. He praises the work the paper has done, and then points out problems, and says \"even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.\"\n\nIt almost sounds like what David Ellison and Bari Weiss say about remaking CBS News. Does that mean we should expect the Post's news reporting to change in some sort of ideological way?\n\nIf Matt Murray or any of his top editors had actually edited that memo, they would've asked for specifics. And they would've put a big question mark alongside that and ask, \"What the hell are you talking about here? Why are you speaking in such elliptical language? Why are you trying to whisper to the newsroom some message that you're not willing to articulate?\"\n\nWe need to ask him exactly what he's saying. I think that that is coded language, and I think that could be political.\n\nIt's a strange thing for the executive editor to be saying. It's almost as if he's asking for some force to adjust the newsroom cadence and its sensibility — when he has the power to do that.\n\n(Editor's note: The Post's PR department on Thursday afternoon referred Business Insider to an interview Murray had with The Wall Street Journal: \"You have to be where users are,\" he said. \"We have to do great journalism that people engage with.\" He said that included an effort to \"talk to a lot of different kinds of people and reflect the full diversity of life,\" the Journal reported.)\n\nWhy does Jeff Bezos own The Washington Post? It seems to be nothing but a headache for him the last few years. It doesn't seem like it helps him curry favor with Donald Trump. It's not like he's using it to buy the \"Melania\" documentary for $75 million. What is the upside for him, and why does he continue to own it, do you think?\n\nErik Wemple: I have no idea. That is something all of us in the media trade have been trying to figure out. It is entirely a black box.\n\nMany years ago, he seemed to be deriving a great deal of satisfaction from this. There was a close bond between The Washington Post Establishment and Bezos. I'm pretty sure it isn't as strong as it once was.\n\nSo I think that the enjoyment he got from his association with his institution has probably faded.\n\nBut in 2024, he said, \"We saved The Washington Post once, and we're going to save it a second time.\" So there's another challenge, right? I guess that that would be something that he would derive some pleasure from. And I would imagine that if he wanted to get really involved and engaged, the way he was back in 2013-2015, the newsroom would welcome that.\n\nA lot of the success stories we hear about in digital media these days are specifically publications that are focused largely or entirely on Washington, DC: Politico, Axios, Punchbowl, Semafor. Some of them have direct DNA from The Washington Post. Is there any chance of the Post reclaiming any of that, either through an acquisition or just by focusing on Washington and policy?\n\nThey have this Washington Post Intelligence thing now, which is sort of akin to that. But I don't know if there are new streams of revenue opening up at the Post. And I think that that's one of the reasons that the staff is so disaffected and so disappointed in the current management — they don't see any sort of progress towards new business.\n\nI think they're seeing cuts. And also a fair amount of silence. I don't think that they're getting the feedback from management that they deserve.",

    "description": "One recent DFA reportedly cleared waivers on Wednesday while another was claimed by the organization where he made his MLB debut",
    "fullText": "The waiver wire was a frequent stop for the Washington Nationals through January after the front office navigated through January with seven official claims, though a pair were designated for assignment just days after joining the organization. It marked a sneaky way for president of baseball operations Paul Toboni to restock his Triple-A roster while tweaking the minor league roster, but the pair of designations marked a risky move in the process with a chance for other teams to swoop in.\n\nThat came to reality for a pair of former waiver claims on Wednesday with a mix of good and bad news on a pair of players.\n\nThe good news is that left handed pitcher Konnor Pilkington reportedly cleared waivers on Wednesday, setting the stage for the Nationals to designate him for assignment in Triple-A. Pilkington was designated for assignment last week to make room for shortstop Tsung-Che Chung, who spent the bulk of last season with Pittsburgh’s Triple-A affiliate.\n\nKonnor Pilkington cleared waivers. Waiting on an official announcement if he accepted his outright to Triple-A.\n\n— Talk Nats (@TalkNats) February 5, 2026\n\nAfter making his debut with the Nationals in July of 2025, Pilkington posted a 4.45 ERA last season with the Nationals over 28.1 innings pitched after he was initially drafted in the third round of the 2018 MLB draft by the Chicago White Sox. The pitcher has also spent time within the Cleveland Guardians and Arizona Diamondbacks organizations. Despite an average ERA during his major league tenure, command appeared to be a challenge for the southpaw. Pilkington allowed 17 walks during his 28.1 innings pitched, compared to 34 strikeouts.\n\nPilkington began his career with the Cleveland Guardians in 2022 where he started in 11 games and appeared in 15, finishing the season with a 3.88 ERA and 50 strikeouts to 32 walks. He then made one appearance in 2023 where he tossed a pair of strikeouts in a pair of scoreless inning, though struggled in his limited time in Triple-A. He was traded to Arizona for cash considerations in May of 2023 where he would spend the rest of the season and 2024 with Triple-A Reno.\n\nThe bad news on Wednesday was that Mickey Gasper, who was designed for assignment last week after the team claimed left hander Richard Lovelady, was claimed by the Boston Red Sox. Washington claimed Gasper from the Minnesota Twins in a flurry of moves through January, but now eliminating one potential option in the Nationals' farm system.\n\nThe Red Sox have claimed Mickey Gasper off waivers. HES BACK!!! pic.twitter.com/HKibdDzfJf\n\n— SleeperRedSox (@SleeperRedSox) February 4, 2026\n\nGasper now returns to the organization to gave him his MLB debut after Boston selected Gasper in the minor league phase of the Rule 5 Draft in 2023, making his debut as a pinch hitter in 2024 where he drew four walks and was hit by a pitch despite finishing 0-for-18 in his at-bats with the Red Sox. Gasper spent the 2025 season with the Minnesota Twins where he batted .158/.257/.232 with a pair of home runs, 11 RBIs and two stolen bases in 45 appearances. The Twins then designated him for assignment in mid-January, the first of what has proven to be a flurry of moves for the utility infielder.",

    "description": "Bennett Stirtz had 22 points for the Hawks, as they overcame a halftime deficit to beat the Huskies",
    "fullText": "The Iowa Hawkeyes (17-5, 7-4) overcame a 7-point halftime deficit to beat the Washington Huskies (12-11, 4-8) 84-74. Bennett Stirtz led the way with 22 points on 8/13 shooting. He added 5 assists to just 1 turnover. Alvaro Folgueiras was a boost off the bench with 16 & Cooper Koch added 11, all of them coming in the second half.\n\nIt was an absolute barn-burner of a first half. Felt like it was constantly teetering for the Hawks. Not only did Iowa give up an 11-0 run early but they had to withstand the Huskies hitting 11 straight baskets before their last second shot went awry. The numbers are astonishing. 1.55 points/possession allowed; 111.5% eFG%; scored on 67.7% of their possessions.\n\nYet the Hawks remained in striking distance, down 48-41 at half. It was thanks to their own impressive efficiency by scoring on 63.3% of possessions. They also converted 7 Husky turnovers into 13 points. Alvaro Folgueiras came off the bench for 12 first half points and Bennett Stirtz added 9.\n\nIn the second half, Iowa quickly cut their deficit. Stirtz got it going by getting to the line, going 1/2, then drilling a 3. Shortly after, Tavion Banks (whose free throw streak ended at 30 earlier in the game) converted a 4-point play and cut it to 52-49.\n\nIowa held the Huskies without a field goal for 6+ minutes and they were able to flip it to a 7-point lead behind some beautiful basketball which culminated in a Stirtz 3 to get the Hawks.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes without a point and Iowa up 3 after a Cam Manyawu dunk, the commentator noted it felt like it was Stirtz’s time. He got a clean 3 and followed it up with a transition dunk to get the lead back to 8 with 7:08 remaining.\n\nThe Huskies broke a 3+ minute scoring drought to bring it to a 7-point lead for Iowa, the shot clock was dwindling down and the ball found Cooper Koch. After passing up an open look against USC earlier this season, he drained a three with Hanne Steinbach draping him to get the lead to 10.\n\nAfter that, it was pretty much formalities. A “Let’s go Hawks” chant broke out. Danny Sprinkles raised a huff because Iowa masterfully allowed the clock to drain after a made basket with 1:02 left. Tate Sage and Folgueiras played keep away on a shot clock violation turnover, which was Iowa’s 4th of the game.\n\nNext up: Sunday, February 8th v Northwestern (2:00P CST, Fox Sports 1)",

    "title": "Jeff Bezos’s Destruction of “The Washington Post” Is a Disgraceful Plutocratic Crime",
    "description": "Chris...",
    "fullText": "It turns out that democracy doesn’t die in darkness at all—it succumbs to repeated group muggings at the hands of the moneyed power elite.\n\nFor the past week, I’ve been unable to retrieve the copies of The Washington Post that usually get delivered to my home, since the brutal weather in the DC area has turned my front yard into an unfordable moat of frozen snow. This now seems a richly prophetic turn of events, since my hometown newspaper is being eviscerated under the disastrous ownership of centibillionaire monopolist and MAGA flunky Jeff Bezos.\n\nPer a new report from The New York Times—cowritten by former Post media columnist Erik Wemple—the paper is initiating “a widespread round of layoffs.” Other outlets reported that at least a third of Post employees across business and editorial are being let go. In a Zoom call with the paper’s staff—one that neither Bezos nor his handpicked Post publisher Will Lewis deigned to attend—editor in chief Matt Murray announced that the Post’s sports section—a distinguished operation that formerly anchored a great deal of the paper’s market penetration in the mid-Atlantic—will be effectively dismantled, with a handful of staffers left to stoke a walking-dead version of it. Local news coverage—another historic strength of the paper, and one of the few coverage areas that cannot be easily replicated by other national titles—is also being gutted. The Post will also be shuttering its recently revived books section—where I worked as deputy editor in the early aughts. The paper’s daily news podcast will be deep-sixed, and its international desk is due to be hollowed out.\n\nNews of this impending bloodletting has been swirling around industry circles for weeks—so much so that foreign correspondents for the Post were reduced last week to publicly begging Bezos to save their jobs, and preserve the Post’s reputation as a serious news organization. Their pleas fell on deaf ears. Bezos didn’t bother to reply and kept an arrogant oligarchic silence during the buildup to this gruesome journalistic dismemberment. Bezos also offered no comment when Post reporter Hannah Natanson had her devices seized by the FBI in the investigation of a series of leaks from a government contractor—an act of intimidation from a Trump White House waging sustained ideological war on the fourth estate. Bezos’s silence on these fundamental assaults on news-gathering underscores his complacent indifference to the civic value of journalism; his true priorities became clear amid the Post’s death watch when he stirred out of his state of public hibernation long enough to host Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth—who has overseen the complete ideological purging of the Pentagon press corps—at his space start-up Blue Origin, which holds billions of dollars in defense contracts.\n\nBezos’s aloof posture isn’t so much a study in plutocratic reticence as the savvy impulse of a mobster determined not to return to a crime scene. The Amazon overlord was hailed as the paper’s savior when he purchased it from the Graham family in 2013. His takeover of the Post was part of a wave of tech-bro splurges in the legacy media market, including Facebook executive Chris Hughes’s ill-fated acquisition of The New Republic, and eBay cofounder Pierre Omidyar’s launch of First Look Media, whose signature outlet The Intercept is now in dire financial straits. Bezos’s acquisition of the Post stood out in this field, both because of the paper’s stature and because of his limitless resources. Surely, the thinking went, with this level of financial backing, the paper could reverse its declining circulation and jury-rig some sort of viable business model for daily journalism in the 21st century.\n\nThis scenario seemed plausible for a while, after Donald Trump was first elected president in 2016. The Post was able to reap a major surge in digital subscriptions by leaning into its image as a Trump-baiting organ of the resistance; its new Bezos-era slogan, crafted by Watergate veteran Bob Woodward, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” neatly distilled this marketing agenda.\n\nBut as the mogul-heavy history of modern journalism shows in stomach-churning detail, news organizations that live by oligarchic support often die by it as well. In reality, the Post under Bezos’s watch was already embarking on myopic and counter-journalistic bids to goose revenues and harvest eyeballs via management-driven plans to bulk up its news-aggregation operations, while launching a wage-soaking freelance initiative dubbed “the Talent Network.” This latter operation, in the rapt telling of Marty Baron, the Post’s editor in chief during the Bezos honeymoon, served as “ the journalistic version of TaskRabbit (freelance labor for everyday tasks) and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (a crowd-sourcing site for on-demand business tasks)…. Overnight, it dramatically expanded the journalistic reach of the Post at a bargain-basement price.”\n\nThe sugar highs of all this digital gimmickry proved short-lived, especially after Bezos, ever attuned to the main chance for piling up more billions, joined the rest of the Silicon Valley power elite in aligning behind Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. Bezos vetoed the Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris, triggering the departure of the paper’s op-ed chief, David Shipley, and hundreds of thousands of canceled subscriptions from outraged readers. He then issued a new dictum for the paper’s opinion shop, ordering that it be devoted to the promotion of “free markets” and “personal liberties”—both long-standing items in the catechism of cosmically wealthy moguls courting public worship. The section has since become an unsightly congeries of glorified press releases from the Cato Institute—together with editorial board fantasias on the heroic leadership of Trump that read like they’d be a stretch for Pravda to pull off. In the wake of the exodus of its entire roster of accomplished liberal columnists, the section’s furthest-left regular contributor is arguably the Tory-Reaganite Never Trumper George Will.\n\nThis concerted ideological defacing of the Post, quite plainly, is at the heart of the paper’s most recent financial plight. But the logic of mogul newsroom dominance forbids Post management from squarely acknowledging this fact—or at least saying it aloud. So in a fraught 2024 newsroom meeting, publisher Will Lewis extended the great managerial tradition of blaming workers for the colossal fuckups of their bosses. “We are losing large amounts of money,” he proclaimed. “Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff.”\n\nAs any competent editor will tell you, Lewis’s use of the passive voice is telling. Audiences don’t halve themselves in a vacuum; the responsible parties were Bezos and his handpicked adjutant Lewis—an eager tabloid handmaiden for clownish and disgraced former British prime minister Boris Johnson, when he wasn’t running interference in the UK Telegraph’s phone-hacking scandal. It turns out that democracy doesn’t die in darkness at all—it succumbs to repeated group muggings at the hands of the moneyed power elite. But that’s a story you’re never going to read in Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "Money is pouring in for workers impacted by Wednesday's layoffs at The Washington Post.\n\nAs of writing, over 1,000 supporters had donated more than $130,000 combined to a GoFundMe page set up for let-go journalists.\n\nThe fundraising push, launched just a few hours after company executives began cutting workers, was set up by Post reporter Rachel Siegel and the newsroom's union. Its top donor, tech journalist and former Post employee Kara Swisher, gave $10,000.\n\nSwisher, who recently made a push to buy the Post from its billionaire owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, wrote on Threads that she had the means to \"donate a decent chunk of dough to these hardworking employees,\" and urged others to follow.\n\nOther top donors appeared to be former Washington Post staffers, such as Eugene Robinson and Fred Barbash.\n\nThe Post's haul, and the speed at which it drew in six figures, make it an outlier among media layoff fundraisers. Laid-off staffers at Vox Media pulled in about $7,000 in their January GoFundMe, while Teen Vogue got about $41,000 after November layoffs.\n\n\"Post Guild members have come together to support their colleagues with this GoFundMe,\" said a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the paper's union. The spokesperson blamed \"inexcusable business decisions of top Post leadership\" for the cuts.\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement on the layoffs. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nAs donations flooded in, others in the media industry offered career support. Executives at the platforms Substack and Beehiiv posted on X (formerly Twitter) that they're offering fee waivers and training for any Post reporters who took the leap to go independent, for example.\n\nThe Post's layoffs, which its newsroom union said impacted hundreds of workers, were designed to trim costs and refocus its efforts around a smaller set of coverage areas, executive editor Matt Murray told employees over Zoom on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe company is shutting down its podcast, \"Post Reports,\" and letting go of journalists focused on sports, books, and foreign affairs. It's restructuring its D.C. metro coverage, and investing in areas like politics and national security that \"demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact,\" Murray wrote in a memo to staff, viewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"Today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people's lives in what has become a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,\" Murray told staffers during the call. \"For too long, we've operated with a structure that's too rooted in the days when we were a quasi-monopoly local newspaper.\"",

    "fullText": "Hundreds of journalists at The Washington Post received dreaded emails in their inboxes on Wednesday morning informing them they'd been laid off. The emails also addressed another key question: how much severance the Post was offering.\n\nThe newspaper, owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, made sweeping cuts across the newsroom as part of a restructuring of its business. Journalists who cover sports, foreign affairs, books, or do audio reporting were particularly impacted. The company said in a statement that the changes were designed to \"strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart.\"\n\nAs some workers were shown the door, human resources sent over severance packages tied to how long they'd worked at the company. Business Insider viewed a copy of the offer terms.\n\nPost journalists aren't required to take the severance offer, and they could lose the package if they don't act professionally during the process, according to a memo sent to staff by human resources and viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe company also must negotiate separation terms with the newsroom's union, the Washington Post Guild. That means \"the exact terms of the separation program\" are not yet final, the memo said.\n\nThe Washington Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The newspaper's union also did not immediately respond.\n\nIn the memo, the Post's HR point person told affected staff that the decision to cut their jobs was in \"no way a reflection of your worth or dedication, but a necessary step in the evolution of our business.\"\n\nOutside of severance, Post workers may also receive financial support from a new GoFundMe page launched on Wednesday that has raised over $100,000, including $10,000 from Kara Swisher.",

    "description": "The problem with billionaires like Jeff Bezos owning news properties like The Washington Post is they can decide one day to turn off the spigot.",
    "fullText": "The cuts at The Washington Post are brutal.\n\nThey are brutal for the paper's readers, who lose crucial coverage like sports and international reporting. And they are brutal for hundreds of Post employees, including lots of people whose work I pay to read with my Post subscription.\n\nThe Post's cuts have also led lots of people to point out the obvious — that Post owner Jeff Bezos, who is currently the world's fourth-richest man, worth an estimated $261 billion, could easily fund the paper's losses … forever, without ever noticing the tab.\n\nJeff Bezos wealth in 2024: $194 billion\n\nJeff Bezos wealth in 2025: $215 billion\n\nJeff Bezos wealth today: $249.4 billion\n\nNet increase in Bezos wealth since 2024: $55.4 billion\n\nCost of Bezos’s 417-foot superyacht: $500 million\n\nAmazon investment in \"Melania\": $75 million…\n\nThe Washington Post lost $77 million in 2023.\n\nJeff Bezos just spent at least $75 million on an infomercial named “Melania” — $40 million paid to the President and First Lady. \n\nPriorities. https://t.co/dsC29R0pVi\n\nJeff Bezos just fired hundreds of reporters at the Washington Post — including the Amazon reporter holding his OWN company accountable.\n\nReminder: Jeff Bezos' net worth is nearly $250,000,000,000.\n\nFor the record: I also wish that Bezos would take his loose change and spend it on journalism.\n\nNote that I didn't say \"journalism instead of\" because when you are talking about Bezos-level wealth, you don't have to choose: You can pay for journalism and rockets and superyachts and Venetian weddings and parties in St. Barts. (And yes, I realize that Bezos' Amazon expenditures on things like the \"Melania\" doc are different from Bezos' personal spending. The point is, he can afford it. In the same way that I can afford to buy a fancy coffee now and then.)\n\nI'm also not weighing in on how much of the Post's problems are the same problems facing every news organization, versus ones Bezos exacerbated by pivoting toward Trump. Or whether the new Post plan — focus on a handful of topics it thinks will resonate with a national audience, like politics and wellness — makes sense or is simply a too-late move already made by many Post competitors.\n\nBut the focus on Bezos underscores the problem the Post has been facing for years: It was a money-losing operation that relied on a billionaire's goodwill. First, to buy it from its previous owners, who let it go for the price of a Joe Rogan podcast deal, and then to fund its losses for years.\n\nMaybe Bezos really is sick of paying for the Post's losses. Maybe funding the Post no longer syncs with a turns out, Donald Trump is actually good now, worldview. The point is that the Post has been in the can't-win position of hoping Jeff Bezos would continue to fund those losses for years. Now he doesn't want to. (Bezos has yet to comment publicly on the cuts; Matt Murray, the Post's top editor, told his staff that the cuts are meant to help \"reinvent The Washington Post for this new era. This work is difficult, but is essential.\")\n\nWhich, again, points out how precarious a position just about every news organization in the US is in right now.\n\nThere are a handful of really excellent publications, which are controlled by billionaires or very wealthy families — The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg News — that are aimed at an upscale, national audience, and they are doing well. There are some thriving startups and niche publications that tend to focus on topics that rich people — or their employers — will pay to learn more about. (Several of them, it turns out, are focused on power and Washington, DC — a sector the Post should have owned.) And there are various forms of aggregators that make a living by repackaging news other people generate, like newsletter publisher 1440.\n\nAnd that's … kind of it. The local news market is so bad we routinely use the word \"desert\" to describe it. There have been many attempts to solve that, and people keep trying new ways to tackle the problem. I wish all of them well because we really, really need local news. TV news is contracting because TV is contracting. Magazines are now frequently \"brands attached to hotels or travel agencies.\"\n\nFaced with this grim reality, it's natural to look at Bezos and think: Just pay for it. And again — I wish he would. But relying on billionaire goodwill is a hope, not a plan.\n\nJournalism — no matter how much we right-size, automate, and innovate — is expensive. And up until the internet, journalism usually existed in the US in spite of those costs because it was bundled with other things people (subscribers, advertisers) were willing to pay for.\n\nNow that bundle has been torn apart, so we need both new models that support what we have today — and ownership structures that will be satisfied with self-sustaining businesses, not ones with huge profit expectations. If I knew how to do that, I'd be doing it. I just know that hoping a billionaire will fix it isn't the answer.",

    "description": "The Washington Post has laid off one-third of its staff, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage.",
    "fullText": "A sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nThe Washington Post laid off one-third of its staff Wednesday, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage in a widespread purge that represented a brutal blow to journalism and one of its most legendary brands.\n\nThe Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, called the move painful but necessary to put the outlet on stronger footing and weather changes in technology and user habits. “We can’t be everything to everyone,” Murray said in a note to staff members.\n\nHe outlined the changes in a companywide online meeting, and staff members then began getting emails with one of two subject lines — telling them their role was or was not eliminated.\n\nRumors of layoffs had circulated for weeks, ever since word leaked that sports reporters who had expected to travel to Italy for the Winter Olympics would not be going. But when official word came down, the size and scale of the cuts were shocking, affecting virtually every department in the newsroom.\n\n“It’s just devastating news for anyone who cares about journalism in America and, in fact, the world,” said Margaret Sullivan, a Columbia University journalism professor and former media columnist at the Post and The New York Times. “The Washington Post has been so important in so many ways, in news coverage, sports and cultural coverage.”\n\nMartin Baron, the Post’s first editor under its current owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos, condemned his former boss and called what has happened at the newspaper “a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”\n\nAs of midday, the Post did not have any news of the changes on its website.\n\nBezos, who has been silent in recent weeks amid pleas from Post journalists to step in and prevent the cutbacks, had no immediate comment Wednesday.\n\nThe newspaper has been bleeding subscribers in part due to decisions made by Bezos, including pulling back from an endorsement of Kamala Harris, a Democrat, during the 2024 presidential election against Donald Trump, a Republican, and directing a more conservative turn on liberal opinion pages.\n\nA private company, the Post does not reveal how many subscribers it has, but it is believed to be roughly 2 million. The Post would also not say how many people it has on staff, making it impossible to estimate how many people were laid off Wednesday. The Post also did not outline its finances.\n\nThe Post’s troubles stand in contrast to its longtime competitor The New York Times, which has been thriving in recent years, in large part due to investments in ancillary products such as games and its Wirecutter product recommendations. The Times has doubled its staff over the past decade.\n\nEliminating the sports section puts an end to a department that has hosted many well-known bylines through the years, among them John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser. The Times has also largely ended its sports section, but it has replaced the coverage by buying The Athletic and incorporating its work into the Times website.\n\nThe Post’s Book World, a destination for book reviews, literary news and author interviews, has been a dedicated section in its Sunday paper.\n\nA half-century ago, the Post’s coverage of Watergate, led by intrepid reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, entered the history books. The Style section under longtime Executive Editor Ben Bradlee hosted some of the country’s best feature writing.\n\nWord of specific cuts drifted out during the day, as when Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker announced on X that she had been laid off, along with all of the newspaper’s Middle East correspondents and editors. “Hard to understand the logic,” she wrote.\n\nIn the immediate future, Murray said, the Post would concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness and impact, and resonate with readers, including politics, national affairs and security. Even during its recent troubles, the Post has been notably aggressive in coverage of Trump’s changes to the federal workforce.\n\nThe company’s structure is rooted in a different era, when the Post was a dominant print product, Murray said in his note to staff members. In areas such as video, the outlet hasn’t kept up with consumer habits, he said.\n\n“Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”\n\nWhile there are business areas that need to be addressed, Baron pointed a finger of blame at Bezos — for a “gutless” order to kill a presidential endorsement and for remaking an editorial page that stands out only for “moral infirmity” and “sickening” efforts to curry favor with Trump.\n\n“Loyal readers, livid as they saw owner Jeff Bezos betraying the values he was supposed to uphold, fled The Post,” Baron wrote. “In truth, they were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands.”\n\nBaron said he was grateful for Bezos’ support when he was editor, noting that the Amazon founder came under brutal pressure from Trump during the president’s first term.\n\n“He spoke forcefully and eloquently of a free press and The Post’s mission, demonstrating his commitment in concrete terms,” Baron wrote. “He often declared that The Post’s success would be among the proudest achievements of his life. I wish I detected the same spirit today. There is no sign of it.”\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

    "fullText": "The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is conducting widespread layoffs.\n\nExecutive editor Matt Murray wrote in a Wednesday memo that the \"substantial newsroom reductions\" would impact \"nearly all news departments.\"\n\nThe layoffs impacted hundreds of workers, according to a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the newsroom's union.\n\nMurray told staff on a Wednesday morning call that the cuts were part of a strategic reset, according to an audio recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nMurray said the changes included \"closing the sports department in its current form.\"\n\n\"We plan to retain several reporters to join features and cover sports as a cultural and societal phenomenon, as well as several folks to staff the print sports section,\" he added.\n\nMurray said impacted teams included audio and journalists who cover books, the DC metro area, and foreign affairs.\n\n\"A few products will be discontinued — among the most significant, we will be closing the book section and will be suspending the Post Reports podcast,\" Murray said.\n\nThe publication's San Francisco bureau was also heavily hit, one Post insider said.\n\nIn his memo, Murray wrote that for the immediate future, the paper would concentrate on \"areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers.\"\n\n\"These layoffs are not inevitable,\" the Washington Post Guild wrote in a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday. \"A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach, and its future.\"\n\nFormer executive editor Martin Baron wrote in a LinkedIn post that \"there were acute business problems that had to be addressed\" during \"a period of head-spinning change in media consumption.\" Baron added that the \"Post's challenges, however, were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nDonald Graham, the Post's former publisher, wrote in a Facebook post that he was saddened by the loss of \"so many excellent reporters and editors\" and that he would \"have to learn a new way to read the paper,\" as he had \"started with the sports page since the late 1940's.\"\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nThis new round of layoffs follows a series of recent shake-ups at the 148-year-old newspaper.\n\nEarly last year, the company told its opinions desk that columnists should refocus their coverage to two pillars: \"personal liberties\" and \"free markets.\"\n\nIn March, the Post reorganized its newsroom in a push to shift away from \"commodity news.\" It then offered buy-outs to staffers in May.\n\nLast year's personnel shifts arrived shortly after the Washington Post came under fire from some readers for its decision to skip endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, breaking from a 35-year tradition. Some critics argued that the decision could have been made to curry favor with Donald Trump.\n\nOver 400 staffers sent a letter to Bezos last January, writing that they were \"deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave.\"\n\nThe Post's staff reductions arrive at a challenging moment for the media industry.\n\nSome brands are seeing revenue fall off due to declines in social media and search traffic. The rise of AI is also squeezing the industry as more readers gather information from chatbots rather than visiting web pages.\n\nThe New York Times, long seen as the 800-pound gorilla in the newspaper business, saw its shares sink about 14% on Monday as investors fretted about increased costs.",

    "description": "The Washington Post is laying off staffers across its newsroom. Here's what executive editor Matt Murray told staffers about what comes next.",
    "fullText": "On Wednesday morning, after weeks of anticipation of layoffs, Washington Post staffers dialed into a Zoom call led by executive editor Matt Murray.\n\n\"Today will be a difficult day,\" he said, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe top editor told workers to expect big changes ahead that would hit every corner of the newsroom and \"feel like a shock to the system.\"\n\n\"Today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people's lives in what has become a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,\" Murray said during the call. \"For too long, we've operated with a structure that's too rooted in the days when we were a quasi-monopoly local newspaper.\"\n\nLater that morning, the company took an ax to its newsroom, cutting journalists across coverage areas like sports, books, and foreign affairs, according to company materials reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe job cuts included hundreds of workers, according to a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the newsroom's union.\n\nThe company, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is shrinking its international footprint, merging editing desks and its art team, and restructuring its D.C. metro coverage, Murray said during the call. Its daily news podcast \"Post Reports\" is also shuttering amid the changes.\n\nTwo staffers told Business Insider that the layoffs were far worse than what they expected.\n\nThe \"substantial newsroom reductions\" were designed to cut costs and refocus the company's work on topics that \"demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact,\" Murray told staffers in a separate memo. Those priority areas will include politics, national affairs, national security, and other forces \"shaping our future\" like science and business, Murray wrote.\n\nOn the call, Murray also mentioned artificial intelligence as a disruptor that could impact the Post going forward.\n\n\"We're still almost on just the doorstep of the dramatic changes that AI is going to bring to all of us,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Post described the changes as a \"significant restructuring\" designed to \"strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nRead the full newsroom memo from Murray below:\n\nAs we shared in our live stream earlier, the company is taking actions today to place The Washington Post on a stronger footing and better position us in this rapidly changing era of new technologies and evolving user habits.\n\nThese moves include substantial newsroom reductions impacting nearly all news departments. For the immediate future, we will concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers: politics, national affairs, people, power and trends; national security in DC and abroad; forces shaping the future including science, health, medicine, technology, climate, and business; journalism that empowers people to take action, from advice to wellness; revelatory investigations; and what's capturing attention in culture, online, and in daily life.\n\nWe will meet with leaders in each department today and tomorrow to review the impacts on their teams.\n\nToday's news is painful. These are difficult actions. We are proud of, and grateful for, the many valued colleagues whose talents and passion have contributed to The Post over many years.\n\nBut we take them with clarity of purpose. The need has never been more urgent to reposition The Post. A more flexible, sustainable model will help us better navigate unprecedented volatility, competition, technological change, news-consumption habits, and cost pressure.\n\nAs you know, we have grappled with financial challenges for some time. They have affected us in multiple rounds of cost cuts and buyouts, along with periodic constraints on other kinds of spending.\n\nWe have concluded that the company's structure is too rooted in a different era, when we were a dominant, local print product. This restructure will help to secure our future in service of our journalistic mission and provide us stability moving forward.\n\nWe are far from alone in reevaluating our model or rethinking how we operate. The ecosystem of news and information, on- and off-platform, is changing radically. News consumers enjoy more variety, voices, platforms, and options than ever before. In just the last five years, multiple startups—and even individuals—have created meaningful products that draw attention and generate impact at low cost.\n\nPlatforms like Search that shaped the previous era of digital news, and which once helped The Post thrive, are in serious decline. Our organic search has fallen by nearly half in the last three years. And we are still in the early days of AI-generated content, which is drastically reshaping user experiences and expectations.\n\nWe are producing much great journalism of which we can be proud. As we discuss every day in the news meeting, some of our best work attracts readers and generates subscriptions and engagement.\n\nUnfortunately, some does not. Some areas, such as video, haven't kept up with changes in how consumers get news and information. Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years. And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.\n\nIf we are to thrive, not just endure, we must reinvent our journalism and our business model with renewed ambition. We already have taken important and, in some cases, long overdue steps toward reinvention—creating the Print desk, transforming digital workflows, and embedding Audience Strategy editors in every department. Today's moves will put us in position to find and develop better ways to connect Post journalism to news consumers in the ways they want it.\n\nFrom this foundation, we aim to build on what is working, and grow with discipline and intent, to experiment, to measure and deepen what resonates with customers.\n\nWe can't be everything to everyone. But we must be indispensable where we compete. That means continually asking why a story matters, who it serves and how it gives people a clearer understanding of the world and an advantage in navigating it.\n\nSome of you have heard me ask how we can shrink the gap between some of what we create in our newsroom during the day and what we — and our children, families, and friends — consume at night.\n\nToday's actions are about addressing those questions, forcefully, to reinvent The Washington Post for this new era. This work is difficult, but it is essential. The Post is a necessary institution, and it must remain relevant.\n\nEven amid challenges, The Washington Post retains great strengths. We have a deep pool of talented journalists and leaders, strong standards, institutional backing, a proud legacy, and millions of customers.\n\nMost important, our central purpose remains as it ever was: To produce riveting and distinct journalism of the highest caliber that breaks news, explains the world with authority and fairness, empowers people with knowledge, and helps them live better-informed lives.",

    "description": "The Iowa Hawkeyes are a top 20 team by KenPom & Bart Torvik - let’s dive into why that’s the case",
    "fullText": "The Iowa Hawkeyes, are sitting at 16-5 & 6-4 in conference play after a convincing win at Oregon. Though the Ducks were down their two leading scorers, the Hawks played a solid game wire-to-wire, trailing just 1:39.\n\nBen McCollum has done something through 3 games out west, where we have seen other Hawkeye outfits struggle. Football is 0-2 in their two trips to LA while the women’s team is 0-4 across two seasons. Fran McCaffery lost two games in blowouts amidst the Palisades fire last year.\n\nYet Ben McCollum has them 3-0 with a solid chance at 4-0 tonight against the Washington Huskies (12-10, 4-7). Their record belies their advanced stats as both KenPom & Bart Torvik rate them in the 40s. Iowa is rated 19th by KenPom & 20th by Bart Torvik, which puts their chances tonight at ~57%.\n\nThat segues nicely into a deeper look into Iowa’s stats and how they stack up halfway through the Big Ten season. Let’s start with the most shocking stat: at 63.0 points allowed per game, Iowa ranks 4th in the NATION & tops in the conference. A big reason for that is pace – both advanced analytic sites rank them in the bottom 20 in that respect.\n\nBut it goes further than that, as Iowa has been excellent in two areas: three-point defense & turnover %. They’re allowing opponents to make just 30% of threes on the season (28.9% in conference play). They rank 29th in the nation in that respect, and tops in the conference. Additionally, opponents are taking 37.7% of their shots from deep, which ranks in the top 3rd nationally. In conference play, their rank is 2nd at 37.3%.\n\nIowa’s turning teams over 22.1% of the time – 7th in the country. Their in-conference rate is 19.9%, and tops here. Iowa’s forcing live ball turnovers 11.3% of the time in Big Ten games (once again tops in the league) and 12.1% overall.\n\nWhat this combination of stats supplement when watching the games is that the Hawks simply guard harder than they have in nearly two decades. Everyone is fighting, they’re handing off screens well, they’re jumping passing lanes. Each of Bennett Stirtz, Tavion Banks, and Isaia Howard rank nationally in steal percentage, paced by Howard’s 4.3% which is 34th in the country.\n\nA portion of this is because they have to: Iowa lacks a true rim protector right now and it shows. Teams are shooting 55.5% from 2 in conference play, ranking 16th. The activity on the perimeter is also opening Iowa up to opposing guards attacking driving lanes with aplomb. The overall mindset is all resulting in a ton of fouls – opponent free throw rates in conference is 40.7% FTA:FGA, bottom in the league. Yuck.\n\nDespite all that, Iowa’s defense is a top 20 outfit – at 97.3 per KenPom & 96.7 at Bart Torvik. Only twice did Iowa’s defense under Fran McCaffery finish in the top 30 and this group would be the best according to KenPom since they finished first in the nation in 2006.\n\nOffensively, there is little drop-off from recent Fran-led teams, with Iowa sitting at 27th in adjusted efficiency according to KenPom. Recent Fran units finished 16th and 18th after a run of top 10 units from 2019-2023.\n\nOf course, the tip of the spear is Bennett Stirtz. He’s the type of guard Iowa has not had in a good long time. Maybe I squint and see Adam Haluska? Andre Woolridge, maybe? He’s 6th in conference both in scoring at 19.0 points/game and assists at 5.0. He’s the only guy in the top six of both category and has been an Iron Man despite fighting through some illness as the conference season ramped. His 90.1% of minutes played ranks 15th. He’s coming off his best game and if he continues playing like this…I like Iowa’s chances against damn near anybody.\n\nBut it’s more than him – early in the season Ben McCollum referenced the importance of paint touches and I kind of can’t stop myself from getting excited any time someone gets in the lane. It’s almost like the equivalent of a 4-5 yard carry every run play where the offense is piling up the body blows. It’s resulted in an effective field goal percentage of 58.5% and 60.2% from 2 (9th in the country). Stirtz & Banks – Iowa’s highest volume shooters from 2 – are at 58.6% and 54.2%. Only Kael Combs, at 55.4% joins them under 60%. Everyone else in the rotation is above 60%.\n\nThe other value of paint touches is that it leads to kickouts on open 3s. Iowa is hitting 37.4% from deep, 29th in the nation. Howard is the lagger there, at 27.5%, but everyone else is above 37%.\n\nOverall, it’s led to a very consistent team game-to-game. I’ve kind of marveled at Iowa’s “Game Score” graph at Bart Torvik.\n\nThey’ve got just one game below 50 – an early season win over Western Illinois – and a second right at 50 when they went on the road to Michigan State. Only three other games below 80, losses to Minnesota and Illinois and then the win versus Rutgers. Just a team who is very comfortable doing what they do agains almost anybody.\n\nThis was just not a level of consistency we had seen from Iowa under late stage Fran. They were far too reliant on the natural variation of basketball – makes and misses – and did not have the rallying cry this group does of “Impose Your Will.”\n\nOf course, there are still 10 conference games left – McCollum, the maniac referred to the games after USC as an 11-game conference tournament – and things could fall apart. But Iowa is performing about as well as could be expected as they’re sitting in the top half of the conference at 6-4. A win tonight would put them in a tie for 7th with UCLA and a game behind Purdue and Wisconsin.\n\nIt’s a tall, and late, task but if there’s a group who will come out and play as expected – it’s this one.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON/NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Oil refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast are struggling to absorb a rapid surge in Venezuelan crude shipments since last month's flagship $2 billion supply deal between Caracas and Washington, pressuring prices and leaving some volumes unsold, according to traders and shipping data.\n\nWhat challenges are U.S. refiners facing with Venezuelan crude?\n\nHow might India's trade deal affect Venezuelan oil sales?\n\nWhat role do trading houses play in Venezuelan exports?\n\nHow has Venezuelan oil export volume changed recently?\n\nThe soft U.S. demand represents ​an early obstacle for President Donald Trump's hopes of sending the majority of the South American country's oil to the United States since U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro ‌last month in a raid in Caracas.\n\nTrading houses Vitol and Trafigura were granted U.S. licenses to market and sell millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil following the U.S. operation and a subsequent supply agreement with interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\nThe trading houses, ‌which joined energy major Chevron in holding approval to export Venezuelan oil, struck several early deals to sell some cargoes to refiners in the U.S. and Europe. However, with Chevron also raising exports quickly, the trading companies are now finding it harder to secure enough buyers among Gulf Coast refiners, traders said.\n\n\"We're all facing this issue where there's more to place and not enough takers,\" one of the traders said, citing reluctance from U.S. refiners to buy Venezuelan crude. Some refiners are complaining that prices, albeit declining, remain high compared to competing Canadian heavy grades.\n\nVenezuelan heavy oil cargoes for delivery at the Gulf Coast are being offered at ⁠about $9.50 per barrel below benchmark Brent, versus discounts of between $6 and $7.50 per ‌barrel in mid-January.\n\nLast month, total Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. almost tripled to 284,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data based on tanker movements.\n\nThe U.S. was absorbing some 500,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil before Washington imposed sanctions on the country in 2019. But exports to the U.S. went to zero in mid-2025 ‍after Trump revoked all licenses to trade and ship.\n\nReaching the U.S. refiners' maximum capacity again will require time, one of the traders said, in part because some facilities would require adjustments to process heavier oil.\n\nThe chief executive of refiner Phillips 66, Mark Lashier, said on Tuesday the company can process around 250,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude, but prices must be competitive for Venezuelan grades to displace other sources of heavy oil.\n\nChevron and Trafigura declined to comment. ​Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA and Vitol did not reply to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "The Browns want to keep Jim Schwartz as their defensive coordinator, which team owner Jimmy Haslam has made clear since firing former head coach Kevin Stefanski last month.\n\nBut with new head coach Todd Monken now in place, it's still unclear whether Schwartz — who is still under contract with Cleveland — will be back.\n\nMonken, Haslam, and General Manager Andrew Berry were all asked about Schwartz's possible return on Tuesday. But led by Monken, all three noted that Schwartz's status is a subject for another day.\n\nMonken noted that he had talked with Schwartz, but didn't divulge anything further about their discussion.\n\n\"First of all, I think Jim is an outstanding defensive coordinator — I think we all would agree with that,\" Monken said. \"But I think it’s a little inappropriate for me to comment about that at this time.\"\n\nIrrespective of Schwartz's status, Monken noted that he does not plan on changing Cleveland's defensive scheme.\n\n\"It’s been a bitch — I apologize — to go against this defense six times over the last three years. Schematically, and more importantly, the players, because ultimately it’s a players’ game,\" Monken said.\n\n\"My anticipation is we’re not going to change the system,\" Monken later added. \"[It’s] very difficult to go against. I’m not planning on changing the system. We’re built for the system that they’re in currently. I’m not going to get into staffing, because that’s not at this time to get into that. But they can rest assured that we’re going to keep the same system. We’re still going to let them attack. We’re still going to let them play free. I can’t see any other way. They’re a big reason why I took this job — the defensive players.\"\n\nAs Monken made clear, it's the players who are his focus, not the defensive coordinator.\n\n\"I didn’t take this job because of Jim Schwartz,\" Monken said. \"I have a lot of respect for Jim Schwartz, as I would hope he has for me. But I took it because of the players that are here, the ownership, Andrew Berry, and the ability to build this roster from the ground up on the offensive side.\n\n\"So, and I said this to the other guys, I didn’t think I’d say it, but I’m gonna say it — when I was preparing for the Cleveland Browns, I wasn’t trying to chip Jim Schwartz, I was chipping Myles Garrett. And when I was sliding a protection to the outside backers or Grant Delpit, they were blitzing off the edge, I was sliding the protection to the players. And when I was worried about throwing to the right against Denzel Ward or Tyson Campbell to the left, that’s who I was worried about throwing at.\"",

    "description": "Four years ago, the \"Commanders\" were born. It's an anniversary that most Washington fans would like to forget.",
    "fullText": "\"We are the Commanders,\" announced former Redskins quarterback Doug Williams.\n\nThat was on February 2, 2022, on NBC's Today Show, with then-team president Jason Wright overseeing how the name would be announced. Wright was there along with Williams and defensive tackle Jonathan Allen. When it came time for the big unveiling, Wright boringly turned to Williams and said, \"Doug, what is it?\" Williams then spoke those unfortunate words, \"We are the Commanders.\"\n\nWright had been hired and was immediately trying to demonstrate a great vocabulary, assuring his listeners of his past success and business acumen. It was all presentation. \"Image is everything\" to the impressionable. Wright, who was in charge of the franchise's business side, then displayed, for three years, an abundance of oversight failures as one thing after another on the business side became increasingly disappointing.\n\nOwner Daniel Snyder and Wright originally came up with something really \"creative\" after dumping \"Redskins,\" which had been the team name since 1933. The two geniuses came up with the \"Washington Football Team.\"\n\nImagine that an NFL football team named itself the \"Football Team.\" Of course, it was mocked and ridiculed by many across the nation. The two guys who thought they were smarter than everyone else they employed had managed to make Washington the only NFL team without an official mascot. Think about it. Isn't it still hard to believe they never saw that as a major red flag?\n\n— Mauro Rmz (@ArconsaRmz) February 2, 2022\n\nHow did we get to \"Commanders\"? Early, Wright announced the team would never return to \"Redskins.\" Then he announced that \"Warriors\" would never be considered. This was ironic because \"Warriors\" was the first name that many in the fan base had expressed excitement about on social media. Then Wright said \"Wolves\" was also ruled out as was \"Redwolves\" though, that too had generated fan interest.\n\nWright had some hired hands (now gone) who somehow saw \"Commanders\" as the suitable replacement for \"Redskins.\" They, like Wright, showed little to no appreciation for the franchise's history. Wright got rid of the franchise's historic throwbacks and introduced alternate uniforms that had absolutely nothing to do with Redskins' history. It was all clearly intentional.\n\nBut then Wright even went a step further, when he claimed, \"Commanders was \"something that broadly resonated with our fans.\" He smoothly slipped that claim into his presentation. Did it? To this day, how many in the fan base have you met who suggested and supported \"Commanders\" before the announcement?\n\nAh yes, February 2, 2022 (2-2-22) four years ago Monday... is the name any better today?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Four years ago, new name was revealed",

    "title": "Raheem Morris primer: What to expect from the 49ers defense and how each position is impacted",
    "description": "Breaking down what to expect from the 49ers defense under their new DC, and who will benefit the most",
    "fullText": "When the San Francisco 49ers interviewed only three candidates for the defensive coordinator job, it felt like the two minority candidates were nothing more than a formality before hiring Gus Bradley. We will see if Bradley heads elsewhere after the 49ers hired Raheem Morris to replace Robert Saleh as their defensive coordinator.\n\nThere was speculation that Jim Schwartz would be a candidate. Recent reports have made Eagles’ defensive coordinator Vic Fangio’s return uncertain. Ultimately, Shanahan gets to work with Morris for the fourth time in the NFL.\n\nMorris’s Rams’ defense aligns with the 49ers’ defensive philosophy heading into last offseason: stop the run. From 2021 through 2023, while Morris was the Rams’ defensive coordinator, they ranked seventh in rushing EPA and fifth in rushing success rate.\n\nAt his core, Morris runs an odd front. So you’re going to hear a lot about how Nick Bosa will have to stand up, maybe five plays a season. You can run 5-man fronts with your base defensive end having his hand in the ground—more on that shortly. It’s worth noting that Morris has shown flexibility. Back in 2020, his defense ran only an odd or bear front — a 3-4 look —17 percent of the time.\n\nHere is an example of a couple of odd fronts Morris and Jeff Ulbrich ran last year with Atlanta:\n\nThat is a classic “bear front,” where you have a pair of 3-techniques and a nose tackle head up over the center. From a personnel perspective, it is easy to see how the 49ers could get their three rookies from the 2025 draft on the field at the same time. CJ West would be the nose tackle, while Alfred Collins and Mykel Williams would be the 3-techniques. Then Nick Bosa and whichever edge rusher the down-and-distance calls for on the opposite side. Morris isn’t going to be the coach to tell Bosa he has to stand up in this scenario.\n\nWhen you do run these five-man fronts, and let’s say Bosa is lined up to the side where there are multiple tight ends or eligible receivers, like the screenshot below, that’s when Bosa would more than likely need to peel off into the flat or drop as a hook defender, which is what ended up happening with the Falcons:\n\nOne way to ensure Bosa rushes the passer is by walking down a linebacker to the edge. In today’s NFL, this is known as a “Penny” front, and it’s something Morris has been doing for years. In Atlanta, he used Kaden Elliss as their adjuster in base packages. Morris did the same with Ernest Jones when he was in Los Angeles. These players can moonlight as edge rushers.\n\nThe adjuster for the 49ers was Dee Winters in 2025, who lined up on the edge 78 times last season. Here’s an example of Winters walking down to the edge in Week 1 on the left side of the screen. Next to him is Mykel Williams, with Jordan Elliott at nose, Kalia Davis as the other defensive tackle, and Bosa on the opposite edge.\n\nThis front all but ensures Winters, Mykel, and Bosa all get 1-on-1 opportunities. Hiring Morris could end up being one of the most beneficial things to happen for the 49ers’ first-round pick from 2025. The majority of Williams’ rushes should come from the interior under Morris with a runway. You can’t ask for a better setup.\n\nI was wondering who would be the 3-technique and how much the 49ers would need to invest in a defensive tackle this offseason, but that player is already on the roster. It’s just a matter of how quickly Williams will develop in Year 2.\n\nWinters is under contract for one more season. We don’t know what to expect from Nick Martin because we didn’t see much of him as a rookie. However, Martin’s calling card coming out of college was that he was at his best rushing the passer. Walking Martin down in these fronts, given his history, likely made Morris an easy sell.\n\nThe 49ers’ signing Elliss as a linebacker would be the least surprising move, given his fit in this defense and how it would allow Warner to patrol the middle, if Morris isn’t a fan of Winters or Martin.\n\nHere’s another look at Winters walking down as the adjuster the following week in New Orleans when the 49ers were in their base defense:\n\nWinters is on the left side of the screen, lined up next to Mykel. The 49ers are in their “big nickel” personnel, with Ji’Ayir Brown in instead of Upton Stout. Not that he can’t do it, but these strong reductions protect Stout from being in the run fit down after down. Instead, as you can see, the nickel is protected, and now it’s a linebacker inserted into the action.\n\nBosa’s return to health should unlock Bryce Huff. Williams cemented himself as an interior pass rusher, and those two outside of him will lead to favorable matchups. If the defense can get anything out of Collins and West as pass rushers, the product on the field in 2025 will seem like a distant memory.\n\nPlayers like Sam Okuayinonu, a restricted free agent, and Keion White should have a greater impact with reduced roles as sub-package players. To reach its ceiling, the team will need the top two picks from the ’25 draft to contribute.\n\nHaving a dominant linebacker like Fred Warner gives Morris the versatility he hasn’t had. The beauty of these 5-1 penny fronts is that you really only need one linebacker. When that player is Warner, you can be uber-aggressive elsewhere.\n\nAfter six weeks of the 2025 season, the Falcons’ defense ranked No. 1 in total DVOA, including first against the run and the pass. They were No. 5 in EPA per play. They were blitzing at a rate that would make Kyle Shanahan triple-check the numbers. Atlanta’s blitz rate was 42.4 percent, second only to Brian Flores.\n\nIt was a sign that Morris was comfortable evolving his scheme. After all, we’re talking about a guy who comes from a Vic Fangio-adjacent tree, and they are not known for their blitzing. The Falcons weren’t getting after the quarterback, so they decided to turn up the heat and manufacture pressure by blitzing.\n\nThe Falcons loved to blitz their nickel. Only two cornerbacks in the league blitzed more than Stout did last year. Stout’s win percentage as a pass rusher was 20.5 percent. It’s a skill set that is just scratching the surface. No player won more at his position with at least 15 pass rushes last year than Stout. He bested second place by three percentage points. It’s another building block for Morris to use in passing situations.\n\nThe Falcons ran Cover 3 at the fifth-highest rate last season and Cover 6 at the third-highest rate. That’s where the 49ers will likely live this year, with quarters being sprinkled into the mix. Despite the heavy blitz usage, Atlanta ran man coverage (Cover 1) at the third-lowest rate last season.\n\nWhich brings us to the secondary…\n\nJessie Bates found out about Morris’s versatility at safety this past season after being named a second-team All-Pro. Bates, who had primarily been a free safety, had lined up closer to the line of scrimmage and in the box more than any other season in his career through the midway point of 2025.\n\nLast year, in every regular-season game, 49ers’ cornerbacks Deommodore Lenoir and Renardo Green lined up on the same side. Falcons cornerback A.J. Terrell often shadowed a receiver. If there was an obvious No. 1 on the other side, Terrell was following him. That will be a change from Saleh to Morris, especially if the 49ers feel like they have a cornerback who is quality enough to travel with the opposition’s best.\n\nSaleh didn’t do that until it was time to throw the kitchen sink at his opponents and give them looks they weren’t prepared for. To me, that suggests he didn’t believe he had the coverage players to travel.\n\nYou wonder how much the Rams’ secondary play influenced Morris’s decisions in Atlanta. Xavier Watts was the last pick in the third round of the 2025 NFL Draft, but he came into the league known as a ballhawk, and did nothing to change those preconceived notions after having five interceptions and six pass breakups as a rookie. Bates had three interceptions in 2026, but had 10 in the previous two seasons combined.\n\nMorris has zero ties to any of the players on the 49ers defense. We know he’s not going to pivot off Bosa, Warner, Williams, and Stout, but it wouldn’t be a surprise to see a change at any other position.\n\nThe coverage silos the Falcons ran last year align with the strengths of Deommodore Lenoir and Renardo Green. Neither will be exposed in man coverage against the high-level wideouts. That doesn’t mean there will be a full game when they aren’t in 1-on-1 scenarios, but Saleh to Morris should make for a simple transition on the perimeter.\n\nThis is not breaking news, but the 49ers don’t have a Bates-level safety on their roster. Malik Mustapha and Ji’Ayir Brown specialize in coming downhill and making plays near the line of scrimmage. Brown is under contract for one more season. Marques Sigle did not show he could play the ball in the air as a rookie. All of these signs point to the 49ers finding a free safety this offseason.\n\nThere are plenty of options in the draft. Judging by everything Morris asks of his safeties and where the current depth chart stands, don’t be surprised to see the Niners use their highest pick on a safety under the John Lynch-Shanahan regime. That’s the one glaring hole on this side of the ball in Morris’s scheme, especially if there will be a spike in blitz rate.",

    "fullText": "GREEN BAY – As Matt LaFleur gears up for his eight season as coach of the Green Bay Packers, he has officially hired ex-Arizona Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon as defensive coordinator, the Packers announced in a Feb. 2 press release.\n\nGannon, who spent three seasons as coach in Arizona, replaces newly hired Miami Dolphins coach Jeff Hafley.\n\nGannon, 43, was 15-36 with the Cardinals. One of his losses came last October when the Packers beat the Cardinals 27-23 in Arizona.\n\nDuring Gannon’s tenure, Arizona ranked No. 2 in the NFL in yards per carry (4.92) and No. 9 in rushing offense (125.5 yards per game).\n\n\"We are thrilled to add Jonathan Gannon to our coaching staff. He possesses tremendous experience as an NFL coordinator and head coach,\" LaFleur said in a statement. \"I am confident that he will be an outstanding addition to our organization, as well as a strong leader of our defense.\"\n\nBefore coaching in Arizona, Gannon was the Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator for two seasons, with his last season being the 2022 Super Bowl run.\n\nIn Gannon's first season in Philadelphia in 2021, the Eagles' defense surrendered 5.2 yards per play, tied for the seventh-fewest in the league, and were tied for fifth-fewest takeaways in the NFL with 16.\n\nIn 2022, Philadelphia was No. 2 in overall defense, led the NFL with a team-record 70 sacks and was tied for No. 4 in the league in takeaways (27) and interceptions (17). The Eagles became the first team in league history to have four players register 10-plus sacks in a single season, and their 70 sacks were the most by a team since the 1989 Minnesota Vikings (71).\n\nPACKERS DC: What to know about new Packers defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon\n\nGannon rose through the coaching ranks working with defenses, including as a defensive backs coach. Over 18 years, Gannon has made coaching stops with the Atlanta Falcons (2007), Tennessee Titans (2012-13), Minnesota Vikings (2014-17) and Indianapolis Colts (2018-20) before arriving in Philadelphia.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers News: Packers coach Matt LaFleur 'thrilled' to hire Jonathan Gannon as DC",

    "fullText": "Notre Dame football had a big hole to fill when defensive backs coach Mike Mickens decided to leave for the NFL, but head coach Marcus Freeman filled the role on Sunday afternoon.\n\nAaron Henry, the now former defensive coordinator for Illinois will join the Irish according Matt Zenitz of CBS Sports. Like he has done in the past, Freeman made a fantastic hire, one where Henry will coach defensive backs along with being the co-defensive coordinator with Chris Ash.\n\nLike social media always does, there were plenty of positive Notre Dame reactions to this hire. Find out below some of the best social media post about the news of the Irish hiring Henry.\n\nMan that is an enormous move from Notre Dame. Henry is a rising star and getting him to take a functional demotion is a sign of how much cache the Irish have right now. https://t.co/hDoDq5cAoS\n\n— Dylan Sinn (@DylanSinn) February 1, 2026\n\nThere aren’t many programs around the country where a defensive coordinator would take a “demotion” to join a team, but that’s what happened here. Notre Dame has plenty of clout in the coaching world right now.\n\nAccording to a source, Notre Dame is expected to Aaron Henry as its new defensive backs coach, replacing Mike Mickens. Henry was defensive coordinator at Illinois the past three seasons.\n\nHenry coached defensive backs for Chris Ash at Rutgers in 2016.\n\n— Pete Sampson (@PeteSampson_) February 1, 2026\n\nRelationships matter, and with the hiring of Henry, he’s be reunited with his former boss, Ash. The familiarity between the two will go a long way towards the transition of the defensive side of the ball.\n\nMissed this a bit earlier. Marcus Freeman with a statement hire. https://t.co/zwyBwxDGje\n\n— Greg Smith (@GregSmithRivals) February 1, 2026\n\nWhile the multiple defensive coaching changes could have doomed the Irish, it doesn’t look like that will be the case. Freeman has done it again, as Notre Dame shouldn’t miss a beat with Henry coaching the secondary.\n\nA big hire for Notre Dame.\n\nThere were multiple NFL teams that had interest in Henry this cycle, including the Jacksonville Jaguars (whom he interviewed with), before he ultimately decided to accept this job with the Fighting Irish.https://t.co/4GOwOvHqCZ https://t.co/ZoeA3WQ8JJ\n\n— Matt Zenitz (@mzenitz) February 1, 2026\n\nIt’s hard to turn down the NFL, but that’s exactly what Henry did with this move. He’ll still be a wanted man in the coming seasons, but for right now, he’s with Notre Dame.\n\nMarcus Freeman is just flat out one of the best in college football at surrounding himself with an elite staff \n\nEvery time Notre Dame loses a stud coach from their staff, Freeman makes an A+ hire to replace them https://t.co/PPp2bLe7JZ\n\n— Always Talkin’ Ball Podcast (@AlwaysTalkBall) February 1, 2026\n\nIt’s pretty clear how you win at the college level now, having an older roster and an elite coaching staff, which it very much looks like Notre Dame will have this coming season. The expectations won’t be changed with Henry’s impending hire, win the College Football Playoff.\n\nOh and Aaron Henry coached Kerby Joseph into an All-Big Ten player Illinois after one season as a full time safety.\n\nJoseph was All-Pro for the Detroit Lions after leading the league in INTs (9) in 2024. \n\nElite resume for Aaron Henry while at Illinois. https://t.co/OWzjWxqrX3\n\n— Notre Dame Recruiting (@NDrecruiting01) February 1, 2026\n\nIt’s one thing to send a 5-star or high 4-stars to the NFL, its entirely another to take lower ranked recruits and turn them into NFL draft picks, which is exactly what Henry has done. Imagine what he’s going to do with top-level players, it’s’ going to be impressive.\n\nNotre Dame is expected to hire Illinois @AaronHenry7 as it's next DB Coach.\n\nHere he is Mic'd up so you can get a feel. \n\nPlaces he's coached:\nFIU, Arkansas, Rutgers, NC State, Vanderbilt, Baylor, Illinois. \n\nIn 2022 he created the #1 scoring defense at Illinois. Without elite… pic.twitter.com/c7egECSEjG\n\n— CathVSConf☘️ (@CathVSConf) February 1, 2026\n\nJust a few years ago, Henry coached the top scoring defense in the country. There is no doubt in my mind that he can get Notre Dame close to that level too.\n\nThis is a chess move. Ash is probably gone after next year and Marcus can just remove the co- tag https://t.co/ljViGNwhBQ\n\n— Brendan (@verypiratey) February 1, 2026\n\nWith what Ash did last fall, and what he’s expected to do this season, there could be multiple teams looking to poach him from South Bend after the year ends. It would be a smooth transition to make Henry the full-time defensive coordinator if Ash does move on.\n\nI’m sorry, did we just pull a Defensive Coordinator from the B1G to be our DBs coach? 👀 https://t.co/Pgp55I7l2r\n\n— The 4 Horsemen Podcast (@HorsemenPod) February 1, 2026\n\nHenry will be more than just a defensive backs coach, but it’s still very impressive that Notre Dame pulled off this feat. Call it the Freeman-effect, as coaches see that he’s a superstar in the making.\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Social reactions to Notre Dame expected to hire Aaron Henry as co-DC",

But with head coach Robert Saleh planning on calling defensive plays, Bradley might lean more toward Arizona.\n\nBradley spent the last three seasons as the defensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts. He has been a DC or head coach in the NFL since 2009. He has run the defenses of the Colts, Seattle Seahawks, LA Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders. He was the head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars from 2013-2016.\n\nHis experience would also be welcome, as LaFleur is a first-time head coach.\n\nOf course, LaFleur and Bradley have not crossed paths yet on any team, so we will see what the plan is.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (DC News Now) — In their Morgan State college dorm in the mid-1990’s, Daronte Jones and Melvin Coleman stayed busy.\n\n“We did a lot of battles in Madden,” Coleman told DC News Now. “I’d be in the bed asleep it would be a Saturday and [Daronte] would walk and grab the controller and put the controller by my bed and soon I’d wake up and he’d jump back in like I don’t see him and be like, ‘oh so what you calling me out?”\n\nIn January, three decades after his Madden battles as a college football player with his roommate, and many professional and college football coaching stops, Jones has been hired as the Washington Commanders new defensive coordinator.\n\nFor Jones – it’s a homecoming. He hails from Prince George’s County, where he attended Bishop McNamara high school in Forestville, Maryland.\n\nIt’s not just his college friends and teammates who remember the Madden matchups. His good friend and teammate from Bishop McNamara Mike Jones also took part in the legendary video games matchups – though he didn’t know at the time he was facing a defensive mastermind.\n\n“He’s definitely the reason why I stopped playing Madden,” Mike said. “Cause he’s reading all your plays and this was the time when he was early in his coaching career… I’m like dude I’m playing for leisure.”\n\nDuring his college career, Daronte suffered a neck injury that kept him off the field. Coleman said Daronte would spend more time in the play calling booth during games and was earning a bigger grasp of the game. He said it showed in Madden too.\n\n“That kind of helped us being coaches and our playing careers were done,” Coleman said. “We learned how to think on the run, think quick, make adjustments quick.”\n\nYou could call Daronte’s coaching career the Daronte Jones World Tour.\n\nIt started in 2001 as a graduate assistant at Division II Lenoir-Rhyne. Coleman said Daronte conducted an interview with the school before they went on their spring break trip senior year. The following years took Jones to Nicholls State (then Division I-AA) as safeties coach, defensive coordinator jobs at high schools in Louisiana and his first return to the DMV where he served as Bowie State’s assistant head coach and defensive coordinator from 2005 to 2009.\n\nJones bounced around more after that. He was cornerbacks coach at UCLA in 2010, defensive backs coach for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League in 2011, Hawaii’s secondary coach in 2012-14 and Wisconsin’s defensive backs coach in 2015.\n\nThen, Jones made the jump to the NFL — first as the Miami Dolphins assistant defensive backs coach, then the Cincinnati Bengals cornerbacks coach, then the Minnesota Vikings defensive backs coach. After a brief stint as LSU’s defensive coordinator in 2021 where he coached star cornerback Derek Stingley Jr., Jones returned to the Vikings, where he stayed until this offseason.\n\n“For most people who think that this is a person who’s coming out of nowhere, that’s not true,” Mike Jones said. “This guy has been grinding close to over 20 years. He’s been grinding and getting information from the best minds in football.”\n\nFor Mike and Coleman, watching Daronte flourish in the football world has been meaningful, but they’ve also seen his growth as a coach.\n\n“Secondary wise, pass defense wise, everywhere he’s gone they’ve gotten better,” Coleman, who is now the safeties coach at Morgan State said. “Somebody is doing well, somebody is probably making the pro bowl. Somebody is probably making all-conference. So the proof is in the work.”\n\nSince 2023, Daronte had worked directly under Brian Flores in Minnesota. Coleman said that Daronte’s coaching influences and style comes from several different legendary coaching trees.\n\n“With him being around [Vic] Fangio, Marvin Lewis, [Mike] Zimmer, Vance Joseph and now Flores,” Coleman said. “He’s got a lot work from them. He got a lot of tape to take from them.”\n\nIn recent seasons, with Daronte serving as the team’s defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator, the Vikings’ defense has played aggressively, focusing on trying to force turnovers and blitzing at some of the highest rates in the NFL.\n\nDaronte’s high school teammate Mike Jones, who is now a counselor at Bishop McNamara says the way he played was pretty similar to how his defenses play.\n\n“He was always in the right spot… When we look at those old films when we get together, he pops on film,” Mike said. “He’s always going all out.”\n\nMike said Daronte earned the nickname “Crow” because “he made crow sounds in the backfield.”\n\n“He would make these crow sounds like he’s lurking in the secondary,” Mike said. “He would take on the biggest person on the team in practice even though he was gonna get knocked down… He’s not scared.”\n\nAccording to his friends, Daronte’s days at McNamara mean a lot to him. Several years ago, Daronte donated to the Bishop McNamara football program. His contributions provide student athletes with scholarship assistance. Daronte’s name is now etched on a plaque in the McNamara locker room, noted him as a 1996 graduate and that year’s male athlete of the year. Daronte played football, wrestling and track & field at McNamara.\n\n“He’s been able to come back and give back to the community itself in terms of the program and the school,” Bishop McNamara football head coach Greg Calhoun said. “But he’s also been able to take advantage of the opportunities to give back.”\n\nCalhoun told DC News Now that he referenced Daronte as inspiration and motivation for his players and as an example to potential recruits.\n\n“I actually just had a set of recruits come through and we just showed his locker again as we always do,” Calhoun said. “A lot of great coaches out here in the world but for him to be selected for that job and that opportunity in this community, is huge.”\n\nBishop McNamara plays in one of, if not the best high school football conferences in the country, the WCAC. The Mustangs last won a WCAC championship in 1990. Since, the conference has been dominated by blue blood programs DeMatha, Gonzaga, St. John’s and Good Counsel.\n\nBut in 2025, months before Daronte being hired by the Commanders, a few seasons into his tenure in Forestville, Calhoun helped his team take a massive step forward. The Mustangs beat their rival Gonzaga, 21-0 on October 11. Gonzaga was the eventual WCAC runners-up.\n\nThe following week, McNamara fell just short to eventual undefeated WCAC champion DeMatha, 12-7. They were one of two teams to come within five points or less of the Stags all season long. It was also DeMatha’s second lowest scoring output of the season.\n\n“We’re not always the first names mentioned in that league,” Mike said. “Now we have something that we can definitely hang our hat on in conversations… Now we have the defensive coordinator of our local team.”\n\nCalhoun believes that an esteemed alum calling plays down the road, could further fuel his players.\n\n“Just knowing that you have somebody of that magnitude at that level kind of puts that pressure on you obviously as the current student in that process, just letting you know you have some big shoes to fill,” Calhoun told DC News Now. “You have some expectations, you have some standards and that’s something that we work to build here in this process and our guys take pride and value in that.”\n\nAnd while Daronte rises in the football coaching ranks, he’s still a boy from Prince George’s County, Maryland.\n\n“I know growing up, everybody was like DC, DC, DC, but now it’s like PG County,” Coleman said. “We’ve got players, we’ve got ballers, we’ve got good thinkers and I think it’s just you’re proud to represent where you’re from.”\n\nAs for what Commanders fans should expects going forward, Coleman said Daronte is “a guy that’s going to be on a mission to be great. To not lose.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s jokes at an elite closed-door Washington, D.C., event bombed so badly that “the room fell silent repeatedly,” The Washington Post reported Sunday.\n\nThe awkwardness happened Saturday night at the Alfalfa Club dinner, an invitation-only event for some 200 of the rich and powerful who gather together each year on Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee’s birthday.\n\nAccording to The Post, it was the first time Trump addressed the club, “speaking before a room whose membership includes such foes as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon (whose bank he is suing), David Rubenstein (whom he fired as head of the Kennedy Center) and Jerome H. Powell (the outgoing Fed chairman whose role he is investigating).”\n\nAn anonymous source told The Post that some of Trump’s jokes “landed with a thud, and the room fell silent repeatedly.”\n\nTrump began his remarks by declaring, “So many people in the room I hate. Most of you I like,” Trump said, before adding, “Who in the hell thought this was going to happen?”\n\nTrump then warned the crowd that he might “cut the speech short” so he could watch “the invasion of Greenland,” before revealing that he was just joking.\n\n“We’re not going to invade Greenland. We’re going to buy it,” Trump said, according to the report. “It’s never been my intention to make Greenland the 51st state. I want to make Canada the 51st state. Greenland will be the 52nd state. Venezuela can be 53rd.”\n\nTrump dropped several off-color comments about his political adversaries, according to attendees. He described calling Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) “Pocahontas” in reference to her claims of Native American heritage. She was supposed to be at the dinner, he said, “but couldn’t find her reservation.” He mentioned that Condoleezza Rice was also in the audience and said he always thought she would be the first female president. “Never in a million years would I have thought Joe Biden would beat her to it,” he added, suggesting that former first lady Jill Biden was the true president in a barb that also appeared to bomb with guests.\n\nAfter the event, Trump flew to his Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, FL, for White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino’s wedding, scheduled to be held Sunday.\n\nThe post Trump Reportedly Bombed His Speech at Closed-Door Black Tie DC Dinner: ‘Jokes Landed With a Thud’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "(refiles to fix hyperlinks in paragraph 8, 14)\n\nDUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Iran's leadership warned of a regional conflict on Sunday if the U.S. were to attack it, stoking the tension between Washington and Tehran, and it ​designated EU armies as \"terrorist groups\" in a retaliatory move.\n\nThe United States has ramped up its naval presence in the ‌Middle East after President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with intervention if it did not agree to a nuclear deal or failed to stop killing protesters.\n\nDespite the ‌standoff between Iran's clerical rulers and the Trump administration, both sides have signalled they are ready to resume talks, and regional allies such as Turkey have sought de-escalation.\n\nAn Iranian official denied an earlier report by state-run Press TV that the Revolutionary Guards' naval forces would carry out live-fire exercises in the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday and Monday, telling Reuters they have no such plan and the media ⁠reports are wrong.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ‌was quoted on state media as saying that although Trump says he has sent ships to the region, \"the Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things, the Iranian people will not be stirred ‍by these threats\".\n\n\"We are not the initiators and do not want to attack any country, but the Iranian nation will strike a strong blow against anyone who attacks and harasses them,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Navy currently has six destroyers, one aircraft carrier, and three littoral combat ships in ​the region, raising the risk of war after Iran's deadly crackdown in January on nationwide protests against Iranian leadership.\n\nTrump was weighing ‌options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces, Reuters has reported, citing multiple sources.\n\nOn Saturday Trump told reporters that Iran was \"seriously talking\" with Washington, hours after Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that arrangements for negotiations were underway.\n\nTrump also said: \"I hope they negotiate something acceptable. You could make a negotiated deal that would be satisfactory with no nuclear weapons.\"\n\nTehran says it is ready for \"fair\" negotiations that do not seek to curtail its defensive capabilities.\n\nThe protests, which started over economic hardships but morphed ⁠into the most acute political challenge to the Islamic Republic since its ​establishment in 1979, have now abated after repression.\n\nOfficial numbers put the unrest-related death ​toll at 3,117, while U.S.-based HRANA rights group said on Sunday it had so far verified the death of 6,713 people. Reuters was unable to independently verify the numbers.\n\nIn a symbolic shift in response to ‍the crackdown on protests, the European ⁠Union on Thursday designated the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation.\n\nIn retaliation on Sunday, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said EU armies would also be designated as such, and that authorities would deliberate on the expulsion of EU ⁠states' military attachés.\n\n\"By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards... the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot\" the speaker told fellow lawmakers, who all wore IRGC ‌uniforms in support of the elite force.\n\nAfter his address, lawmakers shouted \"Death to America, Shame on you Europe\".",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "fullText": "Current Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz was in the running to be the next head coach for the Cleveland Browns. He was one of the three finalists for the job, but he was passed over for Todd Monken. Once it was announced that Schwartz wasn’t going to be the head man in charge, Schwartz seemed upset about missing out on another head coaching opportunity (this was the second time he was passed up on another head coaching spot; he was a finalist for the Browns job in 2020).\n\nPeople will blame the Browns for doing this to Schwartz, but in reality, the person who is not free of blame is Schwartz. The team is trying to keep Schwartz, but the relationship is damaged.\n\nThe relationship between the #Browns and DC Jim Schwartz will “need significant repairing” after he was passed over for the HC job, sources tell me. Schwartz is currently under contract but was anticipating getting the HC job.\n\nHe didn’t… and now there’s work to do. https://t.co/JQ9PncR6CP pic.twitter.com/PTezSh2qI7\n\n— Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) January 28, 2026\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles were considering Schwartz if Vic Fangio were to retire, which is still possible:\n\nSources: Eagles considered Jim Schwartz and Jonathan Gannon for defensive coordinator job after Vic Fangio retirement scare https://t.co/cCl7ZbcmfI\n\n— Jimmy Kempski (@JimmyKempski) February 1, 2026\n\nAs mentioned, the relationship needs to be repaired, but Schwartz is under contract for another year. If the Browns want to bring Schwartz back, it should be met with two options: come back and be a positive force this time, or early retirement.\n\nBoth parties aren’t free of blame for why this situation is the way it is, but Schwartz doesn’t deserve any sympathy. Schwartz acting the way he did when he was passed up on a job was considered unprofessional. Schwartz is likely not going to get another head coaching job, and it’s hard to see him finding another defensive coordinator job this year based on recent events.\n\nIs Schwartz a good defensive coordinator? Yes, but there is a large portion of Browns fans who overrate Schwartz. The Browns have been an elite defense under Schwartz, but in terms of scheme, it’s basic and the talent the team possesses defensively masks the flaws of the scheme. Not much complexity or exoticness, the scheme hasn’t evolved, and that falls on coaching. Most defensive coordinators would love to coach this unit if the job were to be available. Schwartz has no leverage in this situation.\n\nIt’s clear the team wants Schwartz backs and both sides need to come together to mend this relationship, but the Browns should draw a line in the sand to get their coaching staff in order as soon as possible.",

    "description": "The race is set for August, leaving a tight timeline for the ambitious program to come together.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration announced on Friday that the president has signed an executive order directing the creation of an IndyCar race on Washington D.C.'s Capitol Mall. The race would be held on August 23 as part of a larger celebration of the 250th anniversary of American independence.\n\nAccording to an announcement shared by IndyCar, the executive order directs the \"White House Task Force on Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday\" to designate a route for the race. The full order, titled \"Celebrating American Greatness with American Motor Racing,\" was published on the White House website on Friday.\n\nAs an executive order is not itself law, the declaration is not the same as a completed plan to host an IndyCar race around the nation's capital. A tight seven-month timeline will make actually putting the event together a challenge, but a release shared by IndyCar quotes both D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, among other enthusiastic stakeholders working to make the event happen. That suggests some level of cooperation between the city and multiple departments of the presidential administration, greatly increasing the odds that the race comes together before the scheduled Summer date.\n\nNeither IndyCar nor the administration have shared a track layout for the potential race. All mentions of the race note it only as an event celebrating the 250th anniversary of independence, suggesting that this is meant to be a one-time event. That could make a high-profile route through the National Mall more plausible, although construction along a track in that area would still mean major interruptions at some of the country's most-visited tourist sites throughout Spring and Summer.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "description": "Washington travels to take on a scorching hot Illinois offense",
    "fullText": "Radio: Huskies Gameday App, Sports Radio KJR\n\nBetting Line: Washington Huskies +12.5\n\nPoints For per Game: 85.5 (25th)\n\nPoints Against per Game: 68.3 (41st)\n\nAdjusted Offensive Efficiency: 130.4 (1st)\n\nAdjusted Defensive Efficiency: 99.1 (29th)\n\nG- Keaton Wagler, Fr. 6’6, 185: 17.5 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 4.0 apg, 47.7% FG, 43.5% 3pt, 82.6% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +8.6 BPR (22nd nationally)\n\nWagler is one of the all-time outliers in modern college basketball. He was the #150 ranked freshman in the class of 2025 and yet has clearly been a top-25 player in the entire country among all classes as demonstrated by his 46-point demolition of Purdue last weekend. Wagler is a 6’6 3-star freshman point guard who is 12th nationally in offensive efficiency. He hardly ever turns the ball over, is a lights out 3-point shooter, draws a ton of fouls, and can make every pass. Just an amazing season so far.\n\nG- Jake Davis, Jr. 6’6, 215: 4.8 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 0.7 apg, 44.0% FG, 41.5% 3pt, 75.0% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +3.9 BPR (406th nationally)\n\nDavis has been thrust into the starting lineup with the recent injury to starting guard Kylan Boswell. But that’s not necessarily that bad of a thing because Davis is 2nd(!) nationally in offensive efficiency. He absolutely never turns the ball over with just 2 giveaways all season and is the epitome of a 3-point sniper. Over 80% of his attempts this season have been from behind the arc and is a career 40% shooter to justify it. Davis has good size at 6’6 but adds almost nothing from a defense/rebounding standpoint so is exclusively a 5th option floor spacer. Still nice to have.\n\nF- Andrej Stojakovic, Jr. 6’7, 215: 13.9 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 1.1 apg, 50.0% FG, 26.3% 3pt, 81.8% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +4.5 BPR (279th nationally)\n\nStojakovic was the final piece of the puzzle for Illinois in the transfer portal after transferring from Stanford to Cal to now the Illini. The 3-point shot has just never really developed and is at a career low right now but it’s okay because Stojakovic has been great at the rim and in the midrange. The rebounding and steal numbers are lower than you’d like but he’s still clearly an additive player and has the length to bother opponents on the other end even if he isn’t the best defender in the world.\n\nF- David Mirkovic, Fr, 6’9, 250: 12.2 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 2.6 apg, 47.4% FG, 37.5% 3pt, 80.6% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +7.0 BPR (72nd nationally)\n\nMirkovic was an offseason Euro import from Montenegro and has been a really nice addition for Illinois. His assist rate is really high for your average power forward and he’s both a very good rebounder and three-point shooter. His block rate is about what you’d expect for your average 6’4 shooting guard so he offers no rim protection but is big enough to still both Hannes Steinbach in that matchup.\n\nC- Tomislav Ivisic, Jr. 7’1, 255: 10.2 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 0.6 bpg, 49.2% FG, 36.8% 3pt, 70.4% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +7.0 BPR (70th nationally)\n\nThe key to the Illinois offense is the Croatian brother duo of Tomislav and Zvonimir Ivisic who combine to play nearly 100% of the center minutes for Illinois. Tomislav starts has been better on the offensive end while Zvonimir is 2nd in the country in block rate as the rim protector. Both are shooting at least 67% on 2-pointers and almost exactly 36% on 3-pointers which makes them wildly efficient.\n\nIt’s safe to say that the all-Balkan roster makeover has worked out pretty well for Illinois and head coach Brad Underwood. There were thoughts in the offseason that Illinois would end up with 5 of their top 6 players who have a last name ending in “ic”: Mihailo Petrovic, Andrej Stojakovic, David Mirkovic, Tomislav Ivisic, and Zvonimir Ivisic. The only player not of that background was projected to be Kylan Boswell (Stojakovic was born in the US but is the son of former Serbian NBA star Peja Stojakovic so you can’t so the only American).\n\nAlmost every aspect of that remodel has worked except for Petrovic. He hasn’t been close to a starting caliber point guard and has fallen out of the rotation thanks to a ton of turnovers and poor shooting. That might have doomed many teams to underachieve. Except enter Keaton Wagler.\n\nNo one could’ve predicted that a three-star freshman would not only start for Illinois at point guard but legitimately enter the All-American conversation and become a top-ten NBA draft pick. That just doesn’t happen. Wagler is the engine behind an offense that is not just #1 in the country per KenPom but the best in KenPom’s database which goes back to 1997. That will likely drop off a bit at some point but the Illini are an absolute machine.\n\nIt looked like Illinois might only be so-so after they dropped to 8-3 following a home loss to Nebraska. That loss obviously looks better in hindsight and Illinois has won 9 straight since then. They’re now 3-3 against top-20 KenPom teams and 14-0 against everyone else. Not exactly encouraging for Washington.\n\nAs mentioned above, the success revolves around the Illinois offense. They take over half of their shots from beyond the 3-point arc and play five legitimate shooting threats at almost all times. Illinois will absolutely bomb it from deep and shoot 36% as a team from that range. They’ve made at least 10 three-point shots in 11 of their last 12 games. That’s compared to Washington who have hit that mark just 3 times all season (although they notably did it in their last game against Oregon). The math says it’s really hard to out-shoot them.\n\nEven when Illinois does miss a shot, they get it back almost half the time. Illinois is 4th nationally in offensive rebounding rate thanks to being the tallest team in the country with a rotation made entirely of players 6’6 or taller that aggressively crash the glass. That usually leads to kick outs and more three-point attempts rather than easy putbacks but they do shoot 58.4% (25th nationally) on two-point shots when they do decide to shoot it from close range. Oh, and if you foul them then they make nearly 80% of their free throws which ranks 4th nationally.\n\nSo they take and make a lot of three-pointers. And when they miss they get it back at an elite rate. And when they take close shots or get fouled they make them at an elite rate. Maybe we can force turnovers against them? Nope. They also rank 34th in turnover percentage. The math says Illinois has a sizable advantage from every area on offense and that’s why they have the best offense in the country.\n\nThere are some weaknesses to exploit on defense relatively but not that many. Illinois being the tallest team in the country does mean that it’s really hard to be outright bad on defense. They can at least contest shots with their length at every position even if they don’t have the best athletes. The rebounding and blocked shot numbers are very good because of that.\n\nWhere Illinois has their biggest issue is their depth. With Boswell’s injury and Petrovic not living up to expectations it means this is basically a 7-man roster right now. The Ivisic brothers combine to take up essentially all 40 minutes at center and then only 6’9 Ben Humrichous is truly available to soak up minutes at the 3/4 with the guards otherwise playing just about the whole game. So that means just get Illinois in foul trouble, right?\n\nEasier said then done. Illinois knows they’ve got issues with depth and so they just don’t foul. They rank 1st in the country in opponent free throw rate. That’s not a great sign for Washington. The Huskies are 2-7 this year when they have a free throw rate on offense below 30%. Illinois gives up 19% on average. Washington absolutely needs a friendly whistle to have any shot at pulling an upset but it doesn’t seem likely.\n\nThe flip side of Illinois’ aversion to fouling is that they also don’t force turnovers. They’re dead last in opponent turnover rate and 2nd to last in steal rate on defense. If Washington is going to win this game then they need that trend to continue with 5 or fewer turnovers. The Huskies have to find ways to make up possessions knowing what a juggernaut Illinois is on offense and one of the only clear ways to do that is to keep from turning it over when UW has the ball. And oh yeah, they’re going to have shoot like they did against Oregon making close to 50% of their three-pointers.\n\nEarlier this week I looked into how brutal Washington’s schedule has been recently. The 7-game stretch culminating in this game is the 4th toughest for any team this season and they recently wrapped a 5-game stretch that was the toughest of any team in the entire country. Illinois is scorching hot. Washington got a feel good win this weekend to hopefully build some momentum but no one has gotten within 5 points of Illinois since December 13th. Things are set to turn around soon with the schedule lightening up but the best UW can hope for in this one is a late surge helping them cover the spread like they’ve done a few times recently. I’m not counting on it though\n\nWashington Huskies– 68, Illinois Fighting Illini- 85\n\nSeason picks: 14-6 straight up, 10-10 against the spread",

    "fullText": "Mike McCarthy is wasting no time in building his coaching staff at the Pittsburgh Steelers. But in the process, he’s not letting go of everyone who has worked under former head coach Mike Tomlin. After taking on the center role, McCarthy has retained three key assistants from Tomlin’s staff. The news comes just as the Steelers inch closer to finding their new defensive coordinator.\n\n“Mike McCarthy is expected to bring back three members of Mike Tomlin’s staff—linebackers coach Scott McCurley, who was on his staff in Dallas; QB coach Tom Arth; and secondary coach Gerald Alexander, per sources,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s Gerry Dulac tweeted on X.\n\nThe move allows Mike McCarthy to capitalize on these coaches’ familiarity with the organization and their knowledge of it while shaping the staff in his own way.\n\nMeanwhile, Dulac also reported that the Steelers are close to naming a new defensive coordinator.\n\n“New Steelers coach Mike McCarthy is close to bringing in Patrick Graham as his defensive coordinator, per sources,” he wrote on X. “Graham, 47, was defensive coordinator the past three seasons with the Raiders. He also served in that role with the Dolphins (2019) and Giants (2020-21).”\n\nThe post Mike McCarthy Makes Triple Coaching Staff Decision as Steelers Close In on DC appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Prediction markets are getting a bad rap amid concerns about insider trading. Now, some of them are fighting back.\n\nThe Coalition for Prediction Markets, which includes companies like Kalshi, Coinbase, and Robinhood, took out a full-page ad in the Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\nThe ad highlights the companies' support for a ban on insider trading on prediction market platforms and calls on Congress to work with them to \"keep prediction markets safe and transparent.\"\n\n\"CFTC regulated prediction markets (already) ban insider trading,\" the ad reads.\n\nA spokesperson for the coalition told Business Insider the ad is the \"opening salvo\" in a coming PR blitz pushing for the codification of federal regulation for prediction markets — a key goal for the companies, as regulators in some states seek to clamp down on the burgeoning industry.\n\n\"The coalition plans to spend seven figures in the coming months in coordination with its government relations outreach,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe PR campaign comes after a trader on Polymarket made more than $400,000 off of a well-timed bet on former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's political future just hours before his capture by US forces.\n\nThat's led to greater scrutiny of prediction markets broadly, along with a new proposed bill to formally ban insider trading by government officials who might have access to sensitive information.\n\nIn the wake of that trade, Kalshi has sought to distinguish itself from Polymarket, which was banned from serving US users from 2022 to 2025 and only recently gained approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nPolymarket is not a member of the Coalition for Prediction Markets, and the group's spokesperson said that the ad is meant to draw \"a clear contrast with offshore platforms where concerning scandals such as the Maduro trade have occurred.\" A Polymarket spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company, which has signed partnerships with the Wall Street Journal and the Golden Globes, hasn't made any public statements about the Maduro trade controversy.

    "fullText": "It doesn't seem possible, but it was actually 34 years ago on Monday.\n\nThat's right, I remember it so well. It was January 26, 1992, in Super Bowl XXVI, and Washington jumped out to a 17-0 halftime lead over the Buffalo Bills. On the Bills' first second-half possession, linebacker Kurt Gouveia intercepted a Jim Kelly pass, nearly returning it for a touchdown. Gerald Riggs hammered the ball into the end zone, and it was 24-0 Redskins.\n\nREDEMPTION!\nJanuary 26, 1992\n\nFour years after \"The Fumble\" in the AFC Championship with the #Browns in Denver, running back Earnest Byner scores the first touchdown of Super Bowl XXVI en route to the Redskins' third Super Bowl title.#HTTR #RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/FWP0mbSpwV\n\n— Kevin Gallagher (@KevG163) January 26, 2026\n\nEarly in the final quarter, Mark Rypien, Earnest Byner, the Hogs, and the Posse (Art Monk, Gary Clark, Ricky Sanders), Charles Mann, Wilber Marshall, Darrell Green, and the rest of the Redskins were destroying the AFC Champion Bills 37-10. The game's final several minutes were anticlimactic, much less intense, with cameras showing Redskins on the sidelines laughing and enjoying themselves on their way to another Super Bowl championship, as the Bills scored two late scores for a 37-24 final.\n\nIt was Joe Jackson Gibbs' fourth Super Bowl with Washington and the third he had won. He had amazingly won those three Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks who were not Hall of Fame quarterbacks (Joe Theismann, Doug Williams, Mark Rypien). He also won with three different starting running backs (John Riggins, Timmy Smith, Earnest Byner). OT Joe Jacoby, C Jeff Bostic, WR Art Monk, TE Don Warren, G Russ Grimm and LB Monte Coleman played on all four of those Gibbs teams.\n\nSince that time Washington head coaches have been Richie Petitbon, Norv Turner, Terry Robiskie, Marty Schottenheimer, Steve Spurrier, Joe Gibbs again (2004-2007), Jim Zorn, Mike Shanahan, Jay Gruden, Bill Callahan, Ron Rivera, and Dan Quinn.\n\nYes, a lot has changed for Washington in the last 34 years, sadly, even the name.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: 34 years ago was franchise's last Super Bowl",
