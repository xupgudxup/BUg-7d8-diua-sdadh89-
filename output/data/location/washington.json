    "fullText": "Nintendo’s monster-collecting franchise was pilloried as a ‘pestilential Ponzi scheme’ in the 90s. But as its celebrates its 30th birthday, it now stands as a powerful example of video games’ ability to connect people\n\nWhen I was 11, it was my dream to compete in the Pokémon World Championships, held in Sydney in 2000. I’d come across it in a magazine, and then earnestly set about training teams of creatures, transferring them between my Pokémon Red Game Boy cartridge and the 3D arenas of Pokémon Stadium on the Nintendo 64. I never made it as a player but I did finally achieve this dream on my 26th birthday, when I went to Washington DC to cover the world championships as a journalist. I was deeply moved. Presided over by a giant inflatable Pikachu hanging from the ceiling, the competitors and spectators were united in an unselfconscious love for these games, with their colourful menageries and heartfelt messaging about trust, friendship and hard work.\n\nIt is emotional to see the winners lift their trophies after a tense final round of battles, as overwhelmed by their success as any sportsperson. But it’s the pride that the smaller competitors’ parents show in their mini champions that really gets to me. During the first wave of Pokémania in the late 90s, Pokémon was viewed with suspicion by most adults. Now that the first generation of Pokémaniacs have grown up, even becoming parents ourselves, we see it for what it is: an imaginative, challenging and really rather wholesome series of games that rewards every hour that children devote to it.\n\nOver the three decades since the original Red and Blue (or Green, in Asia) versions of the video game were released in Japan in 1996, Pokémon has earned a place among the greats of children’s fiction. Like Harry Potter, the Famous Five and Narnia, it offers a powerful fantasy of self-determination, set in a world almost totally free of adult supervision. In every game, your mother sends you out into the world with a rucksack and a kiss goodbye; after that, it’s all on you.\n\nLike The Simpsons, Pokémon is a kind of cultural shorthand for the millennial generation. More than Mario, Zelda or any other Nintendo creation, Pokémon brings people together. It was designed from the beginning to be a social game, encouraging (and indeed necessitating) that players traded and battled with each other to complete their collection of virtual creatures and train their teams up into super-squads. Today, the internet has entirely normalised the idea of video games as social activities, but in the late 90s this was a novel idea. You can’t play Pokémon without other people: in 1999, that meant huddling in the playground, using a cable to link your Game Boys together; later, in 2016, at the height of the Pokémon Go phenomenon, it meant hundreds of people converging improbably at the same park with their phones to catch a Gengar.\n\nPokémon is often thought of as a turn-of-the-century fad, so it might be surprising to learn that it brings in more money now than it ever did at the height of its first wave of popularity. It has become the highest-grossing entertainment franchise of all time: between the TV series, the merchandise, the trading cards, the games and everything else adorned with the adorable faces of Pikachu and pals, the franchise has brought in north of $100bn, more than Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThis global phenomenon has its roots in Machida, a city on the outskirts of Tokyo, where Pokémon’s creator Satoshi Tajiri was born in 1965. Like many Japanese children in the 60s and 70s, little Satoshi collected bugs, becoming such an expert that his elementary school classmates referred to him as Dr Bug. As a teenager a new obsession arrived: video games, then just making their way into Japanese arcades. His enthusiasm was such that he started putting together a monthly zine, with his friend Ken Sugimori, called Game Freak – later the name of the video game development company they founded together, which still adorns the title screens of modern Pokémon games.\n\nThe idea for Pokémon began to percolate for Tajiri around 1990. Watching people link their Game Boys together with cables to play Tetris, the hit puzzle game, he envisioned the bugs he’d collected crawling between the consoles. But it took six long years for this idea to transform into a monochrome world full of 151 collectible critters, in chunky black Game Boy pixels. During this time the developer nearly went bust several times, taking on projects for Nintendo and other game developers to keep afloat; Tajiri regularly went without a salary.\n\nPokémon’s astronomical success wasn’t instant, but the result of slow-burning sales over years. When it eventually came out in 1996, Pocket Monsters Red and Green – as they were known in Japan – were indie underdogs, made by a tiny team with limited technology for the ageing handheld Game Boy console. Nobody expected it to be much of a hit, but the world of Pokémon Blue has an unexpected sense of place that transcends their technical limitations. The symbiotic relationship between humans, nature and Pokémon permeates every aspect of life, and is often quite touching – particularly at in-game locations such as Lavender Town, where the mourning owners of dead Pokémon come to honour them at a giant commemorative tower.\n\nBut the real marketable genius of Pokémon was the fact that the game came in different versions. The reason that Pokémon games always come in pairs is that different monsters reside in each cartridge. If you want to collect them all, to complete your Pokédex field guide, you need to trade them. Creatures could be sent between cartridges, so friends with different versions of the game could help each other accumulate covetable creatures. With Tetris, the Game Boy’s link cable was used for competition. Here it was used for connection.\n\nPokémon’s popularity spread through playground word-of-mouth. By the time it arrived in the US in 1998, and Europe in 1999, it was already a franchise: Pikachu-adorned games, TV shows, toys, films and lunchboxes, were rolled out carefully by marketers with a proven playbook.\n\nToday, Tajiri is a reclusive figure. Almost everything we know about him comes from a single 1999 interview with Time magazine. The tone of Time’s piece is shockingly dismissive. Declaring the series “a pestilential Ponzi scheme” it describes the “delinquent” and “criminal” behaviour of young Pokémon fans, and the moral bankruptcy of the whole craze – which, it comforts, is likely to peter out soon, like it did for the Power Rangers.\n\nNow that Pokémon has become one of the most enduring and successful entertainment properties of all time, this alarmist attitude seems ridiculous. But the scaremongering was very real. Some of this was simply older people failing to understand the new thing that the kids were into. But there was also an alarmingly xenophobic flavour to the moral panic, this scary Japanese thing with its sinister monsters coming over the seas to captivate children. Christian pastors in the US were proclaiming Pikachu to be a demon. There were movements to ban the TV show from airing.\n\nPerhaps understandably, given the disrespectful and, presumably, hurtful tone of that Time interview, and the moral panic that Pokémania unwittingly ignited, Satoshi Tajiri has shunned the limelight ever since. Now 60, he remains at Game Freak and is still involved in the creation of each new Pokémon game (as of 2025, there are 38 in total), though he reportedly stepped back from day-to-day development in 2012.\n\nJuly 2016 saw the launch of Pokémon Go, a mobile game that quickly became the most popular in US history, with 232 million players across the world. Pokémon Go works kind of like magic. With the app open, you walk around your neighbourhood; on your phone screen, you see a map of your real surroundings, with icons showing where Pokémon might be found. When you encounter a creature it is superimposed on your real surroundings, a Gengar posing casually in your local park. From there you simply flick a Pokéball at the creatures to capture them.\n\nThere’s a unique aspect too to Pokémon Go that makes it different to every other video game-related phenomenon I’ve witnessed. Most of the time when we talk about how games can help people through hard times, we talk about escapism: how virtual worlds can be a reprieve from the problems of the real one. But Pokémon Go was not so much about escapism as connection, a continuation of the lineage of those first games decades before.\n\nAt its height, it connected its players with their local area and the people around them. For a few months, there we were, all looking at our surroundings through a different lens, thinking that there might be a little bit of magic out there in the world, like a bug hiding under a rock.\n\nDr Bug may not be as involved as before, but the pastoral nature he instilled in Pokémon has persisted throughout the last 30 years: the interrelationships between people and Pokémon form the touching core of the games, movies and TV shows, and there is even a quasi-environmentalist bent to its stories. This is, after all, a game about evolution and living in harmony with the natural world. There is a resonance with nature that prevents this $100bn franchise from feeling nakedly cynical or exploitative. Pokémon’s story speaks to an important truth about video games: they are a powerful vector for connection between people. Millions are united by these imaginary creatures, born from one boy’s love of the natural world.\n\nSuper Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun by Keza MacDonald is published by Guardian Faber.

    "title": "I asked an insider what went wrong at Jeff Bezos' Washington Post",
    "description": "After Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013, the billionaire was considered a model owner. Not anymore. I asked an insider what happened.",
    "fullText": "Lots of people are angry at Jeff Bezos because of the massive cuts he's ordered at his Washington Post. But a decade ago, Bezos was widely celebrated for his ownership of the Post, which he had bought for $250 million in 2013.\n\nUnder Bezos' ownership, the Post made huge investments in tech and staff. And readers loved the results — especially during the first Trump era, when the paper turned profitable.\n\nNow things are very different: The Post says it has been losing gobs of money for the past few years, and Bezos has made a series of moves interpreted as a shift toward Trump — which spurred reader revolts, which made things even worse. And all of that led to this week's cuts.\n\nI talked to Erik Wemple, a New York Times media reporter who previously worked at the Post for 14 years, to try to reconcile the two eras of Bezos and the Post, and to get a sense of what might happen next. You can hear our entire chat on my Channels podcast; what follows is an edited excerpt from our conversation.\n\nPeter Kafka: What shape was the Post in when Bezos bought it in 2013?\n\nErik Wemple: The Graham family, which had owned the Post forever, was an amazing steward for the paper. But they had to scale back their newsroom, because the internet had blown holes in classified ads. Classifieds used to be huge at The Washington Post.\n\nAt the time Bezos bought it in 2013, it was not dysfunctional. These were really good journalists, but the paper was in a bit of a funk. It wasn't a reclamation project, but it had seen better days.\n\nIt was faded when he bought it.\n\nCorrect. And when Bezos came in 2013, he really wowed the staff. We all asked him questions. He answered those questions with tremendous enthusiasm and competence. He seemed really energized by this.\n\nWhat did he think he was going to do?\n\nWhen he came in, he was energetic, but deferential on the particulars of running the newspaper. He's like, \"You know what? I'm not in this business, but I do know how to organize discussions about the future of a business.\" And that's what he did. I was in one of them; it was really remarkable.\n\nHe had these things that he believed in. He was important in guiding conversations. And it was really remarkable because he backed it up with money. He invested in the newspaper. He invested in political coverage, big time. Investigative went up. International got a huge, huge boost. And the technology did too.\n\nThis is exactly what you want from your billionaire tech owner: Give us a bunch of money. Improve our tech. Also, stay away. Don't tell us what to do.\n\nThat was exactly the sentiment. And one of the things you mentioned in there is really worth pausing on for a second, which is the lack of intervention, the lack of meddling. He just sort of looked on. And the newsroom really, really, really roared. Especially in the first Trump period.\n\nSo not only does this produce great journalism, it seems like it becomes a business success story — the paper becomes profitable again. Then, after Trump left the White House, there was a lot of hand-wringing about what happens after the Trump bump. People expected audiences to decline across lots of different publications, and that happened, so it makes sense that the Post would struggle a bit. But the numbers you hear about the reported losses — $77 million in 2023, $100 million in 2024 — are staggering. I still don't understand how you can swing to losses like that just because your traffic goes down. What am I missing?\n\nOne of the things that has been reported and pretty well substantiated is they may have over-indexed on staff growth. They vaulted up over a thousand in early 2021, up to 1,100. So I think they got ahead of themselves, and they had to pair that back. That's one of the things.\n\nAnother consideration is that the digital advertising market sort of dried up, so that was a big deal.\n\nIt's all somewhat of a mystery, but I don't doubt that there are meaningful losses.\n\nCan this just be as simple as the Post overhiring? Lots of companies have done that — the tech guys did during the pandemic.\n\nNo, I don't think so. Especially if you look at the more recent past, when they tinkered with the opinion side and shot themselves in the foot.\n\nIn October 2024, the Post announced it would not be endorsing a candidate in the presidential election. And that happened after the Washington Post editorial board had drafted an editorial in favor of Kamala Harris. And hell broke loose — a subscription desertion of hundreds of thousands.\n\nThat's an astonishing number. I remember thinking that it couldn't be real.\n\nThe cause and effect could not have been more direct. People said, \"No way. I'm not giving my money to this organization.\"\n\nThe Post has continued to do lots of news reporting that is critical of the Trump administration. Which made me curious about this line in editor Matt Murray's explanation of the cuts this week. He praises the work the paper has done, and then points out problems, and says \"even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.\"\n\nIt almost sounds like what David Ellison and Bari Weiss say about remaking CBS News. Does that mean we should expect the Post's news reporting to change in some sort of ideological way?\n\nIf Matt Murray or any of his top editors had actually edited that memo, they would've asked for specifics. And they would've put a big question mark alongside that and ask, \"What the hell are you talking about here? Why are you speaking in such elliptical language? Why are you trying to whisper to the newsroom some message that you're not willing to articulate?\"\n\nWe need to ask him exactly what he's saying. I think that that is coded language, and I think that could be political.\n\nIt's a strange thing for the executive editor to be saying. It's almost as if he's asking for some force to adjust the newsroom cadence and its sensibility — when he has the power to do that.\n\n(Editor's note: The Post's PR department on Thursday afternoon referred Business Insider to an interview Murray had with The Wall Street Journal: \"You have to be where users are,\" he said. \"We have to do great journalism that people engage with.\" He said that included an effort to \"talk to a lot of different kinds of people and reflect the full diversity of life,\" the Journal reported.)\n\nWhy does Jeff Bezos own The Washington Post? It seems to be nothing but a headache for him the last few years. It doesn't seem like it helps him curry favor with Donald Trump. It's not like he's using it to buy the \"Melania\" documentary for $75 million. What is the upside for him, and why does he continue to own it, do you think?\n\nErik Wemple: I have no idea. That is something all of us in the media trade have been trying to figure out. It is entirely a black box.\n\nMany years ago, he seemed to be deriving a great deal of satisfaction from this. There was a close bond between The Washington Post Establishment and Bezos. I'm pretty sure it isn't as strong as it once was.\n\nSo I think that the enjoyment he got from his association with his institution has probably faded.\n\nBut in 2024, he said, \"We saved The Washington Post once, and we're going to save it a second time.\" So there's another challenge, right? I guess that that would be something that he would derive some pleasure from. And I would imagine that if he wanted to get really involved and engaged, the way he was back in 2013-2015, the newsroom would welcome that.\n\nA lot of the success stories we hear about in digital media these days are specifically publications that are focused largely or entirely on Washington, DC: Politico, Axios, Punchbowl, Semafor. Some of them have direct DNA from The Washington Post. Is there any chance of the Post reclaiming any of that, either through an acquisition or just by focusing on Washington and policy?\n\nThey have this Washington Post Intelligence thing now, which is sort of akin to that. But I don't know if there are new streams of revenue opening up at the Post. And I think that that's one of the reasons that the staff is so disaffected and so disappointed in the current management — they don't see any sort of progress towards new business.\n\nI think they're seeing cuts. And also a fair amount of silence. I don't think that they're getting the feedback from management that they deserve.",

    "description": "One recent DFA reportedly cleared waivers on Wednesday while another was claimed by the organization where he made his MLB debut",
    "fullText": "The waiver wire was a frequent stop for the Washington Nationals through January after the front office navigated through January with seven official claims, though a pair were designated for assignment just days after joining the organization. It marked a sneaky way for president of baseball operations Paul Toboni to restock his Triple-A roster while tweaking the minor league roster, but the pair of designations marked a risky move in the process with a chance for other teams to swoop in.\n\nThat came to reality for a pair of former waiver claims on Wednesday with a mix of good and bad news on a pair of players.\n\nThe good news is that left handed pitcher Konnor Pilkington reportedly cleared waivers on Wednesday, setting the stage for the Nationals to designate him for assignment in Triple-A. Pilkington was designated for assignment last week to make room for shortstop Tsung-Che Chung, who spent the bulk of last season with Pittsburgh’s Triple-A affiliate.\n\nKonnor Pilkington cleared waivers. Waiting on an official announcement if he accepted his outright to Triple-A.\n\n— Talk Nats (@TalkNats) February 5, 2026\n\nAfter making his debut with the Nationals in July of 2025, Pilkington posted a 4.45 ERA last season with the Nationals over 28.1 innings pitched after he was initially drafted in the third round of the 2018 MLB draft by the Chicago White Sox. The pitcher has also spent time within the Cleveland Guardians and Arizona Diamondbacks organizations. Despite an average ERA during his major league tenure, command appeared to be a challenge for the southpaw. Pilkington allowed 17 walks during his 28.1 innings pitched, compared to 34 strikeouts.\n\nPilkington began his career with the Cleveland Guardians in 2022 where he started in 11 games and appeared in 15, finishing the season with a 3.88 ERA and 50 strikeouts to 32 walks. He then made one appearance in 2023 where he tossed a pair of strikeouts in a pair of scoreless inning, though struggled in his limited time in Triple-A. He was traded to Arizona for cash considerations in May of 2023 where he would spend the rest of the season and 2024 with Triple-A Reno.\n\nThe bad news on Wednesday was that Mickey Gasper, who was designed for assignment last week after the team claimed left hander Richard Lovelady, was claimed by the Boston Red Sox. Washington claimed Gasper from the Minnesota Twins in a flurry of moves through January, but now eliminating one potential option in the Nationals' farm system.\n\nThe Red Sox have claimed Mickey Gasper off waivers. HES BACK!!! pic.twitter.com/HKibdDzfJf\n\n— SleeperRedSox (@SleeperRedSox) February 4, 2026\n\nGasper now returns to the organization to gave him his MLB debut after Boston selected Gasper in the minor league phase of the Rule 5 Draft in 2023, making his debut as a pinch hitter in 2024 where he drew four walks and was hit by a pitch despite finishing 0-for-18 in his at-bats with the Red Sox. Gasper spent the 2025 season with the Minnesota Twins where he batted .158/.257/.232 with a pair of home runs, 11 RBIs and two stolen bases in 45 appearances. The Twins then designated him for assignment in mid-January, the first of what has proven to be a flurry of moves for the utility infielder.",

    "description": "Bennett Stirtz had 22 points for the Hawks, as they overcame a halftime deficit to beat the Huskies",
    "fullText": "The Iowa Hawkeyes (17-5, 7-4) overcame a 7-point halftime deficit to beat the Washington Huskies (12-11, 4-8) 84-74. Bennett Stirtz led the way with 22 points on 8/13 shooting. He added 5 assists to just 1 turnover. Alvaro Folgueiras was a boost off the bench with 16 & Cooper Koch added 11, all of them coming in the second half.\n\nIt was an absolute barn-burner of a first half. Felt like it was constantly teetering for the Hawks. Not only did Iowa give up an 11-0 run early but they had to withstand the Huskies hitting 11 straight baskets before their last second shot went awry. The numbers are astonishing. 1.55 points/possession allowed; 111.5% eFG%; scored on 67.7% of their possessions.\n\nYet the Hawks remained in striking distance, down 48-41 at half. It was thanks to their own impressive efficiency by scoring on 63.3% of possessions. They also converted 7 Husky turnovers into 13 points. Alvaro Folgueiras came off the bench for 12 first half points and Bennett Stirtz added 9.\n\nIn the second half, Iowa quickly cut their deficit. Stirtz got it going by getting to the line, going 1/2, then drilling a 3. Shortly after, Tavion Banks (whose free throw streak ended at 30 earlier in the game) converted a 4-point play and cut it to 52-49.\n\nIowa held the Huskies without a field goal for 6+ minutes and they were able to flip it to a 7-point lead behind some beautiful basketball which culminated in a Stirtz 3 to get the Hawks.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes without a point and Iowa up 3 after a Cam Manyawu dunk, the commentator noted it felt like it was Stirtz’s time. He got a clean 3 and followed it up with a transition dunk to get the lead back to 8 with 7:08 remaining.\n\nThe Huskies broke a 3+ minute scoring drought to bring it to a 7-point lead for Iowa, the shot clock was dwindling down and the ball found Cooper Koch. After passing up an open look against USC earlier this season, he drained a three with Hanne Steinbach draping him to get the lead to 10.\n\nAfter that, it was pretty much formalities. A “Let’s go Hawks” chant broke out. Danny Sprinkles raised a huff because Iowa masterfully allowed the clock to drain after a made basket with 1:02 left. Tate Sage and Folgueiras played keep away on a shot clock violation turnover, which was Iowa’s 4th of the game.\n\nNext up: Sunday, February 8th v Northwestern (2:00P CST, Fox Sports 1)",

    "description": "Chris...",
    "fullText": "It turns out that democracy doesn’t die in darkness at all—it succumbs to repeated group muggings at the hands of the moneyed power elite.\n\nFor the past week, I’ve been unable to retrieve the copies of The Washington Post that usually get delivered to my home, since the brutal weather in the DC area has turned my front yard into an unfordable moat of frozen snow. This now seems a richly prophetic turn of events, since my hometown newspaper is being eviscerated under the disastrous ownership of centibillionaire monopolist and MAGA flunky Jeff Bezos.\n\nPer a new report from The New York Times—cowritten by former Post media columnist Erik Wemple—the paper is initiating “a widespread round of layoffs.” Other outlets reported that at least a third of Post employees across business and editorial are being let go. In a Zoom call with the paper’s staff—one that neither Bezos nor his handpicked Post publisher Will Lewis deigned to attend—editor in chief Matt Murray announced that the Post’s sports section—a distinguished operation that formerly anchored a great deal of the paper’s market penetration in the mid-Atlantic—will be effectively dismantled, with a handful of staffers left to stoke a walking-dead version of it. Local news coverage—another historic strength of the paper, and one of the few coverage areas that cannot be easily replicated by other national titles—is also being gutted. The Post will also be shuttering its recently revived books section—where I worked as deputy editor in the early aughts. The paper’s daily news podcast will be deep-sixed, and its international desk is due to be hollowed out.\n\nNews of this impending bloodletting has been swirling around industry circles for weeks—so much so that foreign correspondents for the Post were reduced last week to publicly begging Bezos to save their jobs, and preserve the Post’s reputation as a serious news organization. Their pleas fell on deaf ears. Bezos didn’t bother to reply and kept an arrogant oligarchic silence during the buildup to this gruesome journalistic dismemberment. Bezos also offered no comment when Post reporter Hannah Natanson had her devices seized by the FBI in the investigation of a series of leaks from a government contractor—an act of intimidation from a Trump White House waging sustained ideological war on the fourth estate. Bezos’s silence on these fundamental assaults on news-gathering underscores his complacent indifference to the civic value of journalism; his true priorities became clear amid the Post’s death watch when he stirred out of his state of public hibernation long enough to host Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth—who has overseen the complete ideological purging of the Pentagon press corps—at his space start-up Blue Origin, which holds billions of dollars in defense contracts.\n\nBezos’s aloof posture isn’t so much a study in plutocratic reticence as the savvy impulse of a mobster determined not to return to a crime scene. The Amazon overlord was hailed as the paper’s savior when he purchased it from the Graham family in 2013. His takeover of the Post was part of a wave of tech-bro splurges in the legacy media market, including Facebook executive Chris Hughes’s ill-fated acquisition of The New Republic, and eBay cofounder Pierre Omidyar’s launch of First Look Media, whose signature outlet The Intercept is now in dire financial straits. Bezos’s acquisition of the Post stood out in this field, both because of the paper’s stature and because of his limitless resources. Surely, the thinking went, with this level of financial backing, the paper could reverse its declining circulation and jury-rig some sort of viable business model for daily journalism in the 21st century.\n\nThis scenario seemed plausible for a while, after Donald Trump was first elected president in 2016. The Post was able to reap a major surge in digital subscriptions by leaning into its image as a Trump-baiting organ of the resistance; its new Bezos-era slogan, crafted by Watergate veteran Bob Woodward, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” neatly distilled this marketing agenda.\n\nBut as the mogul-heavy history of modern journalism shows in stomach-churning detail, news organizations that live by oligarchic support often die by it as well. In reality, the Post under Bezos’s watch was already embarking on myopic and counter-journalistic bids to goose revenues and harvest eyeballs via management-driven plans to bulk up its news-aggregation operations, while launching a wage-soaking freelance initiative dubbed “the Talent Network.” This latter operation, in the rapt telling of Marty Baron, the Post’s editor in chief during the Bezos honeymoon, served as “ the journalistic version of TaskRabbit (freelance labor for everyday tasks) and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (a crowd-sourcing site for on-demand business tasks)…. Overnight, it dramatically expanded the journalistic reach of the Post at a bargain-basement price.”\n\nThe sugar highs of all this digital gimmickry proved short-lived, especially after Bezos, ever attuned to the main chance for piling up more billions, joined the rest of the Silicon Valley power elite in aligning behind Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. Bezos vetoed the Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris, triggering the departure of the paper’s op-ed chief, David Shipley, and hundreds of thousands of canceled subscriptions from outraged readers. He then issued a new dictum for the paper’s opinion shop, ordering that it be devoted to the promotion of “free markets” and “personal liberties”—both long-standing items in the catechism of cosmically wealthy moguls courting public worship. The section has since become an unsightly congeries of glorified press releases from the Cato Institute—together with editorial board fantasias on the heroic leadership of Trump that read like they’d be a stretch for Pravda to pull off. In the wake of the exodus of its entire roster of accomplished liberal columnists, the section’s furthest-left regular contributor is arguably the Tory-Reaganite Never Trumper George Will.\n\nThis concerted ideological defacing of the Post, quite plainly, is at the heart of the paper’s most recent financial plight. But the logic of mogul newsroom dominance forbids Post management from squarely acknowledging this fact—or at least saying it aloud. So in a fraught 2024 newsroom meeting, publisher Will Lewis extended the great managerial tradition of blaming workers for the colossal fuckups of their bosses. “We are losing large amounts of money,” he proclaimed. “Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff.”\n\nAs any competent editor will tell you, Lewis’s use of the passive voice is telling. Audiences don’t halve themselves in a vacuum; the responsible parties were Bezos and his handpicked adjutant Lewis—an eager tabloid handmaiden for clownish and disgraced former British prime minister Boris Johnson, when he wasn’t running interference in the UK Telegraph’s phone-hacking scandal. It turns out that democracy doesn’t die in darkness at all—it succumbs to repeated group muggings at the hands of the moneyed power elite. But that’s a story you’re never going to read in Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

On Wednesday, among a number of reports of requested interviews, the Cardinalas are looking at a young assistant on Houston Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans' staff.\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Mike Garafolo, the Cardinals have requested an interview with Texans defensive backs coach Dino Vasso.\n\nVasso has been with the Texans since 2021, first coaching cornerbacks from 2021-2023, and then all the defensive backs the last two seasons.\n\nHouston's defensive backfield is one of the best in the NFL with players like Derek Stingley Jr., Kamari Lassiter, Jalen Pitre and more.\n\nPrior to his time with the Texans, he was with the Philadelphia Eagles from 2016-2020 as a defensive quality control coach, assistant secondary coach and assistant coordinator on defense.\n\nFrom 2013-2015, he was a coaching assistant for the Kansas City Chiefs under Andy Reid.\n\nLaFleur has not crossed paths with Vasso on any coaching staff yet, but the Cardinals clearly think the young, up-and-coming coach is worth interviewing.\n\nThese names have come up so far:\n\nRams assistant head coach and pass game coordinator Aubrey Pleasant\n\nNew York Giants outside linebackers coach Charlie Bullen\n\nNo one has reported it, but Nick Rallis, the Cardinals' DC for the last three seasons, presumably could be in the mix.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Money is pouring in for workers impacted by Wednesday's layoffs at The Washington Post.\n\nAs of writing, over 1,000 supporters had donated more than $130,000 combined to a GoFundMe page set up for let-go journalists.\n\nThe fundraising push, launched just a few hours after company executives began cutting workers, was set up by Post reporter Rachel Siegel and the newsroom's union. Its top donor, tech journalist and former Post employee Kara Swisher, gave $10,000.\n\nSwisher, who recently made a push to buy the Post from its billionaire owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, wrote on Threads that she had the means to \"donate a decent chunk of dough to these hardworking employees,\" and urged others to follow.\n\nOther top donors appeared to be former Washington Post staffers, such as Eugene Robinson and Fred Barbash.\n\nThe Post's haul, and the speed at which it drew in six figures, make it an outlier among media layoff fundraisers. Laid-off staffers at Vox Media pulled in about $7,000 in their January GoFundMe, while Teen Vogue got about $41,000 after November layoffs.\n\n\"Post Guild members have come together to support their colleagues with this GoFundMe,\" said a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the paper's union. The spokesperson blamed \"inexcusable business decisions of top Post leadership\" for the cuts.\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement on the layoffs. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nAs donations flooded in, others in the media industry offered career support. Executives at the platforms Substack and Beehiiv posted on X (formerly Twitter) that they're offering fee waivers and training for any Post reporters who took the leap to go independent, for example.\n\nThe Post's layoffs, which its newsroom union said impacted hundreds of workers, were designed to trim costs and refocus its efforts around a smaller set of coverage areas, executive editor Matt Murray told employees over Zoom on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe company is shutting down its podcast, \"Post Reports,\" and letting go of journalists focused on sports, books, and foreign affairs. It's restructuring its D.C. metro coverage, and investing in areas like politics and national security that \"demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact,\" Murray wrote in a memo to staff, viewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"Today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people's lives in what has become a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,\" Murray told staffers during the call. \"For too long, we've operated with a structure that's too rooted in the days when we were a quasi-monopoly local newspaper.\"",

    "description": "The Washington Post made sweeping cuts to its newsroom amid a restructuring. Here's the severance package it's offering some workers.",
    "fullText": "Hundreds of journalists at The Washington Post received dreaded emails in their inboxes on Wednesday morning informing them they'd been laid off. The emails also addressed another key question: how much severance the Post was offering.\n\nThe newspaper, owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, made sweeping cuts across the newsroom as part of a restructuring of its business. Journalists who cover sports, foreign affairs, books, or do audio reporting were particularly impacted. The company said in a statement that the changes were designed to \"strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart.\"\n\nAs some workers were shown the door, human resources sent over severance packages tied to how long they'd worked at the company. Business Insider viewed a copy of the offer terms.\n\nPost journalists aren't required to take the severance offer, and they could lose the package if they don't act professionally during the process, according to a memo sent to staff by human resources and viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe company also must negotiate separation terms with the newsroom's union, the Washington Post Guild. That means \"the exact terms of the separation program\" are not yet final, the memo said.\n\nThe Washington Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The newspaper's union also did not immediately respond.\n\nIn the memo, the Post's HR point person told affected staff that the decision to cut their jobs was in \"no way a reflection of your worth or dedication, but a necessary step in the evolution of our business.\"\n\nOutside of severance, Post workers may also receive financial support from a new GoFundMe page launched on Wednesday that has raised over $100,000, including $10,000 from Kara Swisher.",

    "description": "The problem with billionaires like Jeff Bezos owning news properties like The Washington Post is they can decide one day to turn off the spigot.",
    "fullText": "The cuts at The Washington Post are brutal.\n\nThey are brutal for the paper's readers, who lose crucial coverage like sports and international reporting. And they are brutal for hundreds of Post employees, including lots of people whose work I pay to read with my Post subscription.\n\nThe Post's cuts have also led lots of people to point out the obvious — that Post owner Jeff Bezos, who is currently the world's fourth-richest man, worth an estimated $261 billion, could easily fund the paper's losses … forever, without ever noticing the tab.\n\nJeff Bezos wealth in 2024: $194 billion\n\nJeff Bezos wealth in 2025: $215 billion\n\nJeff Bezos wealth today: $249.4 billion\n\nNet increase in Bezos wealth since 2024: $55.4 billion\n\nCost of Bezos’s 417-foot superyacht: $500 million\n\nAmazon investment in \"Melania\": $75 million…\n\nThe Washington Post lost $77 million in 2023.\n\nJeff Bezos just spent at least $75 million on an infomercial named “Melania” — $40 million paid to the President and First Lady. \n\nPriorities. https://t.co/dsC29R0pVi\n\nJeff Bezos just fired hundreds of reporters at the Washington Post — including the Amazon reporter holding his OWN company accountable.\n\nReminder: Jeff Bezos' net worth is nearly $250,000,000,000.\n\nFor the record: I also wish that Bezos would take his loose change and spend it on journalism.\n\nNote that I didn't say \"journalism instead of\" because when you are talking about Bezos-level wealth, you don't have to choose: You can pay for journalism and rockets and superyachts and Venetian weddings and parties in St. Barts. (And yes, I realize that Bezos' Amazon expenditures on things like the \"Melania\" doc are different from Bezos' personal spending. The point is, he can afford it. In the same way that I can afford to buy a fancy coffee now and then.)\n\nI'm also not weighing in on how much of the Post's problems are the same problems facing every news organization, versus ones Bezos exacerbated by pivoting toward Trump. Or whether the new Post plan — focus on a handful of topics it thinks will resonate with a national audience, like politics and wellness — makes sense or is simply a too-late move already made by many Post competitors.\n\nBut the focus on Bezos underscores the problem the Post has been facing for years: It was a money-losing operation that relied on a billionaire's goodwill. First, to buy it from its previous owners, who let it go for the price of a Joe Rogan podcast deal, and then to fund its losses for years.\n\nMaybe Bezos really is sick of paying for the Post's losses. Maybe funding the Post no longer syncs with a turns out, Donald Trump is actually good now, worldview. The point is that the Post has been in the can't-win position of hoping Jeff Bezos would continue to fund those losses for years. Now he doesn't want to. (Bezos has yet to comment publicly on the cuts; Matt Murray, the Post's top editor, told his staff that the cuts are meant to help \"reinvent The Washington Post for this new era. This work is difficult, but is essential.\")\n\nWhich, again, points out how precarious a position just about every news organization in the US is in right now.\n\nThere are a handful of really excellent publications, which are controlled by billionaires or very wealthy families — The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg News — that are aimed at an upscale, national audience, and they are doing well. There are some thriving startups and niche publications that tend to focus on topics that rich people — or their employers — will pay to learn more about. (Several of them, it turns out, are focused on power and Washington, DC — a sector the Post should have owned.) And there are various forms of aggregators that make a living by repackaging news other people generate, like newsletter publisher 1440.\n\nAnd that's … kind of it. The local news market is so bad we routinely use the word \"desert\" to describe it. There have been many attempts to solve that, and people keep trying new ways to tackle the problem. I wish all of them well because we really, really need local news. TV news is contracting because TV is contracting. Magazines are now frequently \"brands attached to hotels or travel agencies.\"\n\nFaced with this grim reality, it's natural to look at Bezos and think: Just pay for it. And again — I wish he would. But relying on billionaire goodwill is a hope, not a plan.\n\nJournalism — no matter how much we right-size, automate, and innovate — is expensive. And up until the internet, journalism usually existed in the US in spite of those costs because it was bundled with other things people (subscribers, advertisers) were willing to pay for.\n\nNow that bundle has been torn apart, so we need both new models that support what we have today — and ownership structures that will be satisfied with self-sustaining businesses, not ones with huge profit expectations. If I knew how to do that, I'd be doing it. I just know that hoping a billionaire will fix it isn't the answer.",

    "description": "The Washington Post has laid off one-third of its staff, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage.",
    "fullText": "A sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nThe Washington Post laid off one-third of its staff Wednesday, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage in a widespread purge that represented a brutal blow to journalism and one of its most legendary brands.\n\nThe Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, called the move painful but necessary to put the outlet on stronger footing and weather changes in technology and user habits. “We can’t be everything to everyone,” Murray said in a note to staff members.\n\nHe outlined the changes in a companywide online meeting, and staff members then began getting emails with one of two subject lines — telling them their role was or was not eliminated.\n\nRumors of layoffs had circulated for weeks, ever since word leaked that sports reporters who had expected to travel to Italy for the Winter Olympics would not be going. But when official word came down, the size and scale of the cuts were shocking, affecting virtually every department in the newsroom.\n\n“It’s just devastating news for anyone who cares about journalism in America and, in fact, the world,” said Margaret Sullivan, a Columbia University journalism professor and former media columnist at the Post and The New York Times. “The Washington Post has been so important in so many ways, in news coverage, sports and cultural coverage.”\n\nMartin Baron, the Post’s first editor under its current owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos, condemned his former boss and called what has happened at the newspaper “a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”\n\nAs of midday, the Post did not have any news of the changes on its website.\n\nBezos, who has been silent in recent weeks amid pleas from Post journalists to step in and prevent the cutbacks, had no immediate comment Wednesday.\n\nThe newspaper has been bleeding subscribers in part due to decisions made by Bezos, including pulling back from an endorsement of Kamala Harris, a Democrat, during the 2024 presidential election against Donald Trump, a Republican, and directing a more conservative turn on liberal opinion pages.\n\nA private company, the Post does not reveal how many subscribers it has, but it is believed to be roughly 2 million. The Post would also not say how many people it has on staff, making it impossible to estimate how many people were laid off Wednesday. The Post also did not outline its finances.\n\nThe Post’s troubles stand in contrast to its longtime competitor The New York Times, which has been thriving in recent years, in large part due to investments in ancillary products such as games and its Wirecutter product recommendations. The Times has doubled its staff over the past decade.\n\nEliminating the sports section puts an end to a department that has hosted many well-known bylines through the years, among them John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser. The Times has also largely ended its sports section, but it has replaced the coverage by buying The Athletic and incorporating its work into the Times website.\n\nThe Post’s Book World, a destination for book reviews, literary news and author interviews, has been a dedicated section in its Sunday paper.\n\nA half-century ago, the Post’s coverage of Watergate, led by intrepid reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, entered the history books. The Style section under longtime Executive Editor Ben Bradlee hosted some of the country’s best feature writing.\n\nWord of specific cuts drifted out during the day, as when Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker announced on X that she had been laid off, along with all of the newspaper’s Middle East correspondents and editors. “Hard to understand the logic,” she wrote.\n\nIn the immediate future, Murray said, the Post would concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness and impact, and resonate with readers, including politics, national affairs and security. Even during its recent troubles, the Post has been notably aggressive in coverage of Trump’s changes to the federal workforce.\n\nThe company’s structure is rooted in a different era, when the Post was a dominant print product, Murray said in his note to staff members. In areas such as video, the outlet hasn’t kept up with consumer habits, he said.\n\n“Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”\n\nWhile there are business areas that need to be addressed, Baron pointed a finger of blame at Bezos — for a “gutless” order to kill a presidential endorsement and for remaking an editorial page that stands out only for “moral infirmity” and “sickening” efforts to curry favor with Trump.\n\n“Loyal readers, livid as they saw owner Jeff Bezos betraying the values he was supposed to uphold, fled The Post,” Baron wrote. “In truth, they were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands.”\n\nBaron said he was grateful for Bezos’ support when he was editor, noting that the Amazon founder came under brutal pressure from Trump during the president’s first term.\n\n“He spoke forcefully and eloquently of a free press and The Post’s mission, demonstrating his commitment in concrete terms,” Baron wrote. “He often declared that The Post’s success would be among the proudest achievements of his life. I wish I detected the same spirit today. There is no sign of it.”\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

Some critics argued that the decision could have been made to curry favor with Donald Trump.\n\nOver 400 staffers sent a letter to Bezos last January, writing that they were \"deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave.\"\n\nThe Post's staff reductions arrive at a challenging moment for the media industry.\n\nSome brands are seeing revenue fall off due to declines in social media and search traffic. The rise of AI is also squeezing the industry as more readers gather information from chatbots rather than visiting web pages.\n\nThe New York Times, long seen as the 800-pound gorilla in the newspaper business, saw its shares sink about 14% on Monday as investors fretted about increased costs.",

    "fullText": "On Wednesday morning, after weeks of anticipation of layoffs, Washington Post staffers dialed into a Zoom call led by executive editor Matt Murray.\n\n\"Today will be a difficult day,\" he said, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe top editor told workers to expect big changes ahead that would hit every corner of the newsroom and \"feel like a shock to the system.\"\n\n\"Today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people's lives in what has become a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,\" Murray said during the call. \"For too long, we've operated with a structure that's too rooted in the days when we were a quasi-monopoly local newspaper.\"\n\nLater that morning, the company took an ax to its newsroom, cutting journalists across coverage areas like sports, books, and foreign affairs, according to company materials reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe job cuts included hundreds of workers, according to a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the newsroom's union.\n\nThe company, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is shrinking its international footprint, merging editing desks and its art team, and restructuring its D.C. metro coverage, Murray said during the call. Its daily news podcast \"Post Reports\" is also shuttering amid the changes.\n\nTwo staffers told Business Insider that the layoffs were far worse than what they expected.\n\nThe \"substantial newsroom reductions\" were designed to cut costs and refocus the company's work on topics that \"demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact,\" Murray told staffers in a separate memo. Those priority areas will include politics, national affairs, national security, and other forces \"shaping our future\" like science and business, Murray wrote.\n\nOn the call, Murray also mentioned artificial intelligence as a disruptor that could impact the Post going forward.\n\n\"We're still almost on just the doorstep of the dramatic changes that AI is going to bring to all of us,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Post described the changes as a \"significant restructuring\" designed to \"strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nRead the full newsroom memo from Murray below:\n\nAs we shared in our live stream earlier, the company is taking actions today to place The Washington Post on a stronger footing and better position us in this rapidly changing era of new technologies and evolving user habits.\n\nThese moves include substantial newsroom reductions impacting nearly all news departments. For the immediate future, we will concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers: politics, national affairs, people, power and trends; national security in DC and abroad; forces shaping the future including science, health, medicine, technology, climate, and business; journalism that empowers people to take action, from advice to wellness; revelatory investigations; and what's capturing attention in culture, online, and in daily life.\n\nWe will meet with leaders in each department today and tomorrow to review the impacts on their teams.\n\nToday's news is painful. These are difficult actions. We are proud of, and grateful for, the many valued colleagues whose talents and passion have contributed to The Post over many years.\n\nBut we take them with clarity of purpose. The need has never been more urgent to reposition The Post. A more flexible, sustainable model will help us better navigate unprecedented volatility, competition, technological change, news-consumption habits, and cost pressure.\n\nAs you know, we have grappled with financial challenges for some time. They have affected us in multiple rounds of cost cuts and buyouts, along with periodic constraints on other kinds of spending.\n\nWe have concluded that the company's structure is too rooted in a different era, when we were a dominant, local print product. This restructure will help to secure our future in service of our journalistic mission and provide us stability moving forward.\n\nWe are far from alone in reevaluating our model or rethinking how we operate. The ecosystem of news and information, on- and off-platform, is changing radically. News consumers enjoy more variety, voices, platforms, and options than ever before. In just the last five years, multiple startups—and even individuals—have created meaningful products that draw attention and generate impact at low cost.\n\nPlatforms like Search that shaped the previous era of digital news, and which once helped The Post thrive, are in serious decline. Our organic search has fallen by nearly half in the last three years. And we are still in the early days of AI-generated content, which is drastically reshaping user experiences and expectations.\n\nWe are producing much great journalism of which we can be proud. As we discuss every day in the news meeting, some of our best work attracts readers and generates subscriptions and engagement.\n\nUnfortunately, some does not. Some areas, such as video, haven't kept up with changes in how consumers get news and information. Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years. And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.\n\nIf we are to thrive, not just endure, we must reinvent our journalism and our business model with renewed ambition. We already have taken important and, in some cases, long overdue steps toward reinvention—creating the Print desk, transforming digital workflows, and embedding Audience Strategy editors in every department. Today's moves will put us in position to find and develop better ways to connect Post journalism to news consumers in the ways they want it.\n\nFrom this foundation, we aim to build on what is working, and grow with discipline and intent, to experiment, to measure and deepen what resonates with customers.\n\nWe can't be everything to everyone. But we must be indispensable where we compete. That means continually asking why a story matters, who it serves and how it gives people a clearer understanding of the world and an advantage in navigating it.\n\nSome of you have heard me ask how we can shrink the gap between some of what we create in our newsroom during the day and what we — and our children, families, and friends — consume at night.\n\nToday's actions are about addressing those questions, forcefully, to reinvent The Washington Post for this new era. This work is difficult, but it is essential. The Post is a necessary institution, and it must remain relevant.\n\nEven amid challenges, The Washington Post retains great strengths. We have a deep pool of talented journalists and leaders, strong standards, institutional backing, a proud legacy, and millions of customers.\n\nMost important, our central purpose remains as it ever was: To produce riveting and distinct journalism of the highest caliber that breaks news, explains the world with authority and fairness, empowers people with knowledge, and helps them live better-informed lives.",

    "description": "The Iowa Hawkeyes are a top 20 team by KenPom & Bart Torvik - let’s dive into why that’s the case",
    "fullText": "The Iowa Hawkeyes, are sitting at 16-5 & 6-4 in conference play after a convincing win at Oregon. Though the Ducks were down their two leading scorers, the Hawks played a solid game wire-to-wire, trailing just 1:39.\n\nBen McCollum has done something through 3 games out west, where we have seen other Hawkeye outfits struggle. Football is 0-2 in their two trips to LA while the women’s team is 0-4 across two seasons. Fran McCaffery lost two games in blowouts amidst the Palisades fire last year.\n\nYet Ben McCollum has them 3-0 with a solid chance at 4-0 tonight against the Washington Huskies (12-10, 4-7). Their record belies their advanced stats as both KenPom & Bart Torvik rate them in the 40s. Iowa is rated 19th by KenPom & 20th by Bart Torvik, which puts their chances tonight at ~57%.\n\nThat segues nicely into a deeper look into Iowa’s stats and how they stack up halfway through the Big Ten season. Let’s start with the most shocking stat: at 63.0 points allowed per game, Iowa ranks 4th in the NATION & tops in the conference. A big reason for that is pace – both advanced analytic sites rank them in the bottom 20 in that respect.\n\nBut it goes further than that, as Iowa has been excellent in two areas: three-point defense & turnover %. They’re allowing opponents to make just 30% of threes on the season (28.9% in conference play). They rank 29th in the nation in that respect, and tops in the conference. Additionally, opponents are taking 37.7% of their shots from deep, which ranks in the top 3rd nationally. In conference play, their rank is 2nd at 37.3%.\n\nIowa’s turning teams over 22.1% of the time – 7th in the country. Their in-conference rate is 19.9%, and tops here. Iowa’s forcing live ball turnovers 11.3% of the time in Big Ten games (once again tops in the league) and 12.1% overall.\n\nWhat this combination of stats supplement when watching the games is that the Hawks simply guard harder than they have in nearly two decades. Everyone is fighting, they’re handing off screens well, they’re jumping passing lanes. Each of Bennett Stirtz, Tavion Banks, and Isaia Howard rank nationally in steal percentage, paced by Howard’s 4.3% which is 34th in the country.\n\nA portion of this is because they have to: Iowa lacks a true rim protector right now and it shows. Teams are shooting 55.5% from 2 in conference play, ranking 16th. The activity on the perimeter is also opening Iowa up to opposing guards attacking driving lanes with aplomb. The overall mindset is all resulting in a ton of fouls – opponent free throw rates in conference is 40.7% FTA:FGA, bottom in the league. Yuck.\n\nDespite all that, Iowa’s defense is a top 20 outfit – at 97.3 per KenPom & 96.7 at Bart Torvik. Only twice did Iowa’s defense under Fran McCaffery finish in the top 30 and this group would be the best according to KenPom since they finished first in the nation in 2006.\n\nOffensively, there is little drop-off from recent Fran-led teams, with Iowa sitting at 27th in adjusted efficiency according to KenPom. Recent Fran units finished 16th and 18th after a run of top 10 units from 2019-2023.\n\nOf course, the tip of the spear is Bennett Stirtz. He’s the type of guard Iowa has not had in a good long time. Maybe I squint and see Adam Haluska? Andre Woolridge, maybe? He’s 6th in conference both in scoring at 19.0 points/game and assists at 5.0. He’s the only guy in the top six of both category and has been an Iron Man despite fighting through some illness as the conference season ramped. His 90.1% of minutes played ranks 15th. He’s coming off his best game and if he continues playing like this…I like Iowa’s chances against damn near anybody.\n\nBut it’s more than him – early in the season Ben McCollum referenced the importance of paint touches and I kind of can’t stop myself from getting excited any time someone gets in the lane. It’s almost like the equivalent of a 4-5 yard carry every run play where the offense is piling up the body blows. It’s resulted in an effective field goal percentage of 58.5% and 60.2% from 2 (9th in the country). Stirtz & Banks – Iowa’s highest volume shooters from 2 – are at 58.6% and 54.2%. Only Kael Combs, at 55.4% joins them under 60%. Everyone else in the rotation is above 60%.\n\nThe other value of paint touches is that it leads to kickouts on open 3s. Iowa is hitting 37.4% from deep, 29th in the nation. Howard is the lagger there, at 27.5%, but everyone else is above 37%.\n\nOverall, it’s led to a very consistent team game-to-game. I’ve kind of marveled at Iowa’s “Game Score” graph at Bart Torvik.\n\nThey’ve got just one game below 50 – an early season win over Western Illinois – and a second right at 50 when they went on the road to Michigan State. Only three other games below 80, losses to Minnesota and Illinois and then the win versus Rutgers. Just a team who is very comfortable doing what they do agains almost anybody.\n\nThis was just not a level of consistency we had seen from Iowa under late stage Fran. They were far too reliant on the natural variation of basketball – makes and misses – and did not have the rallying cry this group does of “Impose Your Will.”\n\nOf course, there are still 10 conference games left – McCollum, the maniac referred to the games after USC as an 11-game conference tournament – and things could fall apart. But Iowa is performing about as well as could be expected as they’re sitting in the top half of the conference at 6-4. A win tonight would put them in a tie for 7th with UCLA and a game behind Purdue and Wisconsin.\n\nIt’s a tall, and late, task but if there’s a group who will come out and play as expected – it’s this one.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON/NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Oil refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast are struggling to absorb a rapid surge in Venezuelan crude shipments since last month's flagship $2 billion supply deal between Caracas and Washington, pressuring prices and leaving some volumes unsold, according to traders and shipping data.\n\nWhat challenges are U.S. refiners facing with Venezuelan crude?\n\nHow might India's trade deal affect Venezuelan oil sales?\n\nWhat role do trading houses play in Venezuelan exports?\n\nHow has Venezuelan oil export volume changed recently?\n\nThe soft U.S. demand represents ​an early obstacle for President Donald Trump's hopes of sending the majority of the South American country's oil to the United States since U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro ‌last month in a raid in Caracas.\n\nTrading houses Vitol and Trafigura were granted U.S. licenses to market and sell millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil following the U.S. operation and a subsequent supply agreement with interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\nThe trading houses, ‌which joined energy major Chevron in holding approval to export Venezuelan oil, struck several early deals to sell some cargoes to refiners in the U.S. and Europe. However, with Chevron also raising exports quickly, the trading companies are now finding it harder to secure enough buyers among Gulf Coast refiners, traders said.\n\n\"We're all facing this issue where there's more to place and not enough takers,\" one of the traders said, citing reluctance from U.S. refiners to buy Venezuelan crude. Some refiners are complaining that prices, albeit declining, remain high compared to competing Canadian heavy grades.\n\nVenezuelan heavy oil cargoes for delivery at the Gulf Coast are being offered at ⁠about $9.50 per barrel below benchmark Brent, versus discounts of between $6 and $7.50 per ‌barrel in mid-January.\n\nLast month, total Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. almost tripled to 284,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data based on tanker movements.\n\nThe U.S. was absorbing some 500,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil before Washington imposed sanctions on the country in 2019. But exports to the U.S. went to zero in mid-2025 ‍after Trump revoked all licenses to trade and ship.\n\nReaching the U.S. refiners' maximum capacity again will require time, one of the traders said, in part because some facilities would require adjustments to process heavier oil.\n\nThe chief executive of refiner Phillips 66, Mark Lashier, said on Tuesday the company can process around 250,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude, but prices must be competitive for Venezuelan grades to displace other sources of heavy oil.\n\nChevron and Trafigura declined to comment. ​Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA and Vitol did not reply to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "The Browns want to keep Jim Schwartz as their defensive coordinator, which team owner Jimmy Haslam has made clear since firing former head coach Kevin Stefanski last month.\n\nBut with new head coach Todd Monken now in place, it's still unclear whether Schwartz — who is still under contract with Cleveland — will be back.\n\nMonken, Haslam, and General Manager Andrew Berry were all asked about Schwartz's possible return on Tuesday. But led by Monken, all three noted that Schwartz's status is a subject for another day.\n\nMonken noted that he had talked with Schwartz, but didn't divulge anything further about their discussion.\n\n\"First of all, I think Jim is an outstanding defensive coordinator — I think we all would agree with that,\" Monken said. \"But I think it’s a little inappropriate for me to comment about that at this time.\"\n\nIrrespective of Schwartz's status, Monken noted that he does not plan on changing Cleveland's defensive scheme.\n\n\"It’s been a bitch — I apologize — to go against this defense six times over the last three years. Schematically, and more importantly, the players, because ultimately it’s a players’ game,\" Monken said.\n\n\"My anticipation is we’re not going to change the system,\" Monken later added. \"[It’s] very difficult to go against. I’m not planning on changing the system. We’re built for the system that they’re in currently. I’m not going to get into staffing, because that’s not at this time to get into that. But they can rest assured that we’re going to keep the same system. We’re still going to let them attack. We’re still going to let them play free. I can’t see any other way. They’re a big reason why I took this job — the defensive players.\"\n\nAs Monken made clear, it's the players who are his focus, not the defensive coordinator.\n\n\"I didn’t take this job because of Jim Schwartz,\" Monken said. \"I have a lot of respect for Jim Schwartz, as I would hope he has for me. But I took it because of the players that are here, the ownership, Andrew Berry, and the ability to build this roster from the ground up on the offensive side.\n\n\"So, and I said this to the other guys, I didn’t think I’d say it, but I’m gonna say it — when I was preparing for the Cleveland Browns, I wasn’t trying to chip Jim Schwartz, I was chipping Myles Garrett. And when I was sliding a protection to the outside backers or Grant Delpit, they were blitzing off the edge, I was sliding the protection to the players. And when I was worried about throwing to the right against Denzel Ward or Tyson Campbell to the left, that’s who I was worried about throwing at.\"",

    "fullText": "\"We are the Commanders,\" announced former Redskins quarterback Doug Williams.\n\nThat was on February 2, 2022, on NBC's Today Show, with then-team president Jason Wright overseeing how the name would be announced. Wright was there along with Williams and defensive tackle Jonathan Allen. When it came time for the big unveiling, Wright boringly turned to Williams and said, \"Doug, what is it?\" Williams then spoke those unfortunate words, \"We are the Commanders.\"\n\nWright had been hired and was immediately trying to demonstrate a great vocabulary, assuring his listeners of his past success and business acumen. It was all presentation. \"Image is everything\" to the impressionable. Wright, who was in charge of the franchise's business side, then displayed, for three years, an abundance of oversight failures as one thing after another on the business side became increasingly disappointing.\n\nOwner Daniel Snyder and Wright originally came up with something really \"creative\" after dumping \"Redskins,\" which had been the team name since 1933. The two geniuses came up with the \"Washington Football Team.\"\n\nImagine that an NFL football team named itself the \"Football Team.\" Of course, it was mocked and ridiculed by many across the nation. The two guys who thought they were smarter than everyone else they employed had managed to make Washington the only NFL team without an official mascot. Think about it. Isn't it still hard to believe they never saw that as a major red flag?\n\n— Mauro Rmz (@ArconsaRmz) February 2, 2022\n\nHow did we get to \"Commanders\"? Early, Wright announced the team would never return to \"Redskins.\" Then he announced that \"Warriors\" would never be considered. This was ironic because \"Warriors\" was the first name that many in the fan base had expressed excitement about on social media. Then Wright said \"Wolves\" was also ruled out as was \"Redwolves\" though, that too had generated fan interest.\n\nWright had some hired hands (now gone) who somehow saw \"Commanders\" as the suitable replacement for \"Redskins.\" They, like Wright, showed little to no appreciation for the franchise's history. Wright got rid of the franchise's historic throwbacks and introduced alternate uniforms that had absolutely nothing to do with Redskins' history. It was all clearly intentional.\n\nBut then Wright even went a step further, when he claimed, \"Commanders was \"something that broadly resonated with our fans.\" He smoothly slipped that claim into his presentation. Did it? To this day, how many in the fan base have you met who suggested and supported \"Commanders\" before the announcement?\n\nAh yes, February 2, 2022 (2-2-22) four years ago Monday... is the name any better today?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Four years ago, new name was revealed",

    "description": "Breaking down what to expect from the 49ers defense under their new DC, and who will benefit the most",
    "fullText": "When the San Francisco 49ers interviewed only three candidates for the defensive coordinator job, it felt like the two minority candidates were nothing more than a formality before hiring Gus Bradley. We will see if Bradley heads elsewhere after the 49ers hired Raheem Morris to replace Robert Saleh as their defensive coordinator.\n\nThere was speculation that Jim Schwartz would be a candidate. Recent reports have made Eagles’ defensive coordinator Vic Fangio’s return uncertain. Ultimately, Shanahan gets to work with Morris for the fourth time in the NFL.\n\nMorris’s Rams’ defense aligns with the 49ers’ defensive philosophy heading into last offseason: stop the run. From 2021 through 2023, while Morris was the Rams’ defensive coordinator, they ranked seventh in rushing EPA and fifth in rushing success rate.\n\nAt his core, Morris runs an odd front. So you’re going to hear a lot about how Nick Bosa will have to stand up, maybe five plays a season. You can run 5-man fronts with your base defensive end having his hand in the ground—more on that shortly. It’s worth noting that Morris has shown flexibility. Back in 2020, his defense ran only an odd or bear front — a 3-4 look —17 percent of the time.\n\nHere is an example of a couple of odd fronts Morris and Jeff Ulbrich ran last year with Atlanta:\n\nThat is a classic “bear front,” where you have a pair of 3-techniques and a nose tackle head up over the center. From a personnel perspective, it is easy to see how the 49ers could get their three rookies from the 2025 draft on the field at the same time. CJ West would be the nose tackle, while Alfred Collins and Mykel Williams would be the 3-techniques. Then Nick Bosa and whichever edge rusher the down-and-distance calls for on the opposite side. Morris isn’t going to be the coach to tell Bosa he has to stand up in this scenario.\n\nWhen you do run these five-man fronts, and let’s say Bosa is lined up to the side where there are multiple tight ends or eligible receivers, like the screenshot below, that’s when Bosa would more than likely need to peel off into the flat or drop as a hook defender, which is what ended up happening with the Falcons:\n\nOne way to ensure Bosa rushes the passer is by walking down a linebacker to the edge. In today’s NFL, this is known as a “Penny” front, and it’s something Morris has been doing for years. In Atlanta, he used Kaden Elliss as their adjuster in base packages. Morris did the same with Ernest Jones when he was in Los Angeles. These players can moonlight as edge rushers.\n\nThe adjuster for the 49ers was Dee Winters in 2025, who lined up on the edge 78 times last season. Here’s an example of Winters walking down to the edge in Week 1 on the left side of the screen. Next to him is Mykel Williams, with Jordan Elliott at nose, Kalia Davis as the other defensive tackle, and Bosa on the opposite edge.\n\nThis front all but ensures Winters, Mykel, and Bosa all get 1-on-1 opportunities. Hiring Morris could end up being one of the most beneficial things to happen for the 49ers’ first-round pick from 2025. The majority of Williams’ rushes should come from the interior under Morris with a runway. You can’t ask for a better setup.\n\nI was wondering who would be the 3-technique and how much the 49ers would need to invest in a defensive tackle this offseason, but that player is already on the roster. It’s just a matter of how quickly Williams will develop in Year 2.\n\nWinters is under contract for one more season. We don’t know what to expect from Nick Martin because we didn’t see much of him as a rookie. However, Martin’s calling card coming out of college was that he was at his best rushing the passer. Walking Martin down in these fronts, given his history, likely made Morris an easy sell.\n\nThe 49ers’ signing Elliss as a linebacker would be the least surprising move, given his fit in this defense and how it would allow Warner to patrol the middle, if Morris isn’t a fan of Winters or Martin.\n\nHere’s another look at Winters walking down as the adjuster the following week in New Orleans when the 49ers were in their base defense:\n\nWinters is on the left side of the screen, lined up next to Mykel. The 49ers are in their “big nickel” personnel, with Ji’Ayir Brown in instead of Upton Stout. Not that he can’t do it, but these strong reductions protect Stout from being in the run fit down after down. Instead, as you can see, the nickel is protected, and now it’s a linebacker inserted into the action.\n\nBosa’s return to health should unlock Bryce Huff. Williams cemented himself as an interior pass rusher, and those two outside of him will lead to favorable matchups. If the defense can get anything out of Collins and West as pass rushers, the product on the field in 2025 will seem like a distant memory.\n\nPlayers like Sam Okuayinonu, a restricted free agent, and Keion White should have a greater impact with reduced roles as sub-package players. To reach its ceiling, the team will need the top two picks from the ’25 draft to contribute.\n\nHaving a dominant linebacker like Fred Warner gives Morris the versatility he hasn’t had. The beauty of these 5-1 penny fronts is that you really only need one linebacker. When that player is Warner, you can be uber-aggressive elsewhere.\n\nAfter six weeks of the 2025 season, the Falcons’ defense ranked No. 1 in total DVOA, including first against the run and the pass. They were No. 5 in EPA per play. They were blitzing at a rate that would make Kyle Shanahan triple-check the numbers. Atlanta’s blitz rate was 42.4 percent, second only to Brian Flores.\n\nIt was a sign that Morris was comfortable evolving his scheme. After all, we’re talking about a guy who comes from a Vic Fangio-adjacent tree, and they are not known for their blitzing. The Falcons weren’t getting after the quarterback, so they decided to turn up the heat and manufacture pressure by blitzing.\n\nThe Falcons loved to blitz their nickel. Only two cornerbacks in the league blitzed more than Stout did last year. Stout’s win percentage as a pass rusher was 20.5 percent. It’s a skill set that is just scratching the surface. No player won more at his position with at least 15 pass rushes last year than Stout. He bested second place by three percentage points. It’s another building block for Morris to use in passing situations.\n\nThe Falcons ran Cover 3 at the fifth-highest rate last season and Cover 6 at the third-highest rate. That’s where the 49ers will likely live this year, with quarters being sprinkled into the mix. Despite the heavy blitz usage, Atlanta ran man coverage (Cover 1) at the third-lowest rate last season.\n\nWhich brings us to the secondary…\n\nJessie Bates found out about Morris’s versatility at safety this past season after being named a second-team All-Pro. Bates, who had primarily been a free safety, had lined up closer to the line of scrimmage and in the box more than any other season in his career through the midway point of 2025.\n\nLast year, in every regular-season game, 49ers’ cornerbacks Deommodore Lenoir and Renardo Green lined up on the same side. Falcons cornerback A.J. Terrell often shadowed a receiver. If there was an obvious No. 1 on the other side, Terrell was following him. That will be a change from Saleh to Morris, especially if the 49ers feel like they have a cornerback who is quality enough to travel with the opposition’s best.\n\nSaleh didn’t do that until it was time to throw the kitchen sink at his opponents and give them looks they weren’t prepared for. To me, that suggests he didn’t believe he had the coverage players to travel.\n\nYou wonder how much the Rams’ secondary play influenced Morris’s decisions in Atlanta. Xavier Watts was the last pick in the third round of the 2025 NFL Draft, but he came into the league known as a ballhawk, and did nothing to change those preconceived notions after having five interceptions and six pass breakups as a rookie. Bates had three interceptions in 2026, but had 10 in the previous two seasons combined.\n\nMorris has zero ties to any of the players on the 49ers defense. We know he’s not going to pivot off Bosa, Warner, Williams, and Stout, but it wouldn’t be a surprise to see a change at any other position.\n\nThe coverage silos the Falcons ran last year align with the strengths of Deommodore Lenoir and Renardo Green. Neither will be exposed in man coverage against the high-level wideouts. That doesn’t mean there will be a full game when they aren’t in 1-on-1 scenarios, but Saleh to Morris should make for a simple transition on the perimeter.\n\nThis is not breaking news, but the 49ers don’t have a Bates-level safety on their roster. Malik Mustapha and Ji’Ayir Brown specialize in coming downhill and making plays near the line of scrimmage. Brown is under contract for one more season. Marques Sigle did not show he could play the ball in the air as a rookie. All of these signs point to the 49ers finding a free safety this offseason.\n\nThere are plenty of options in the draft. Judging by everything Morris asks of his safeties and where the current depth chart stands, don’t be surprised to see the Niners use their highest pick on a safety under the John Lynch-Shanahan regime. That’s the one glaring hole on this side of the ball in Morris’s scheme, especially if there will be a spike in blitz rate.",

    "fullText": "GREEN BAY – As Matt LaFleur gears up for his eight season as coach of the Green Bay Packers, he has officially hired ex-Arizona Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon as defensive coordinator, the Packers announced in a Feb. 2 press release.\n\nGannon, who spent three seasons as coach in Arizona, replaces newly hired Miami Dolphins coach Jeff Hafley.\n\nGannon, 43, was 15-36 with the Cardinals. One of his losses came last October when the Packers beat the Cardinals 27-23 in Arizona.\n\nDuring Gannon’s tenure, Arizona ranked No. 2 in the NFL in yards per carry (4.92) and No. 9 in rushing offense (125.5 yards per game).\n\n\"We are thrilled to add Jonathan Gannon to our coaching staff. He possesses tremendous experience as an NFL coordinator and head coach,\" LaFleur said in a statement. \"I am confident that he will be an outstanding addition to our organization, as well as a strong leader of our defense.\"\n\nBefore coaching in Arizona, Gannon was the Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator for two seasons, with his last season being the 2022 Super Bowl run.\n\nIn Gannon's first season in Philadelphia in 2021, the Eagles' defense surrendered 5.2 yards per play, tied for the seventh-fewest in the league, and were tied for fifth-fewest takeaways in the NFL with 16.\n\nIn 2022, Philadelphia was No. 2 in overall defense, led the NFL with a team-record 70 sacks and was tied for No. 4 in the league in takeaways (27) and interceptions (17). The Eagles became the first team in league history to have four players register 10-plus sacks in a single season, and their 70 sacks were the most by a team since the 1989 Minnesota Vikings (71).\n\nPACKERS DC: What to know about new Packers defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon\n\nGannon rose through the coaching ranks working with defenses, including as a defensive backs coach. Over 18 years, Gannon has made coaching stops with the Atlanta Falcons (2007), Tennessee Titans (2012-13), Minnesota Vikings (2014-17) and Indianapolis Colts (2018-20) before arriving in Philadelphia.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers News: Packers coach Matt LaFleur 'thrilled' to hire Jonathan Gannon as DC",

    "fullText": "Notre Dame football had a big hole to fill when defensive backs coach Mike Mickens decided to leave for the NFL, but head coach Marcus Freeman filled the role on Sunday afternoon.\n\nAaron Henry, the now former defensive coordinator for Illinois will join the Irish according Matt Zenitz of CBS Sports. Like he has done in the past, Freeman made a fantastic hire, one where Henry will coach defensive backs along with being the co-defensive coordinator with Chris Ash.\n\nLike social media always does, there were plenty of positive Notre Dame reactions to this hire. Find out below some of the best social media post about the news of the Irish hiring Henry.\n\nMan that is an enormous move from Notre Dame. Henry is a rising star and getting him to take a functional demotion is a sign of how much cache the Irish have right now. https://t.co/hDoDq5cAoS\n\n— Dylan Sinn (@DylanSinn) February 1, 2026\n\nThere aren’t many programs around the country where a defensive coordinator would take a “demotion” to join a team, but that’s what happened here. Notre Dame has plenty of clout in the coaching world right now.\n\nAccording to a source, Notre Dame is expected to Aaron Henry as its new defensive backs coach, replacing Mike Mickens. Henry was defensive coordinator at Illinois the past three seasons.\n\nHenry coached defensive backs for Chris Ash at Rutgers in 2016.\n\n— Pete Sampson (@PeteSampson_) February 1, 2026\n\nRelationships matter, and with the hiring of Henry, he’s be reunited with his former boss, Ash. The familiarity between the two will go a long way towards the transition of the defensive side of the ball.\n\nMissed this a bit earlier. Marcus Freeman with a statement hire. https://t.co/zwyBwxDGje\n\n— Greg Smith (@GregSmithRivals) February 1, 2026\n\nWhile the multiple defensive coaching changes could have doomed the Irish, it doesn’t look like that will be the case. Freeman has done it again, as Notre Dame shouldn’t miss a beat with Henry coaching the secondary.\n\nA big hire for Notre Dame.\n\nThere were multiple NFL teams that had interest in Henry this cycle, including the Jacksonville Jaguars (whom he interviewed with), before he ultimately decided to accept this job with the Fighting Irish.https://t.co/4GOwOvHqCZ https://t.co/ZoeA3WQ8JJ\n\n— Matt Zenitz (@mzenitz) February 1, 2026\n\nIt’s hard to turn down the NFL, but that’s exactly what Henry did with this move. He’ll still be a wanted man in the coming seasons, but for right now, he’s with Notre Dame.\n\nMarcus Freeman is just flat out one of the best in college football at surrounding himself with an elite staff \n\nEvery time Notre Dame loses a stud coach from their staff, Freeman makes an A+ hire to replace them https://t.co/PPp2bLe7JZ\n\n— Always Talkin’ Ball Podcast (@AlwaysTalkBall) February 1, 2026\n\nIt’s pretty clear how you win at the college level now, having an older roster and an elite coaching staff, which it very much looks like Notre Dame will have this coming season. The expectations won’t be changed with Henry’s impending hire, win the College Football Playoff.\n\nOh and Aaron Henry coached Kerby Joseph into an All-Big Ten player Illinois after one season as a full time safety.\n\nJoseph was All-Pro for the Detroit Lions after leading the league in INTs (9) in 2024. \n\nElite resume for Aaron Henry while at Illinois. https://t.co/OWzjWxqrX3\n\n— Notre Dame Recruiting (@NDrecruiting01) February 1, 2026\n\nIt’s one thing to send a 5-star or high 4-stars to the NFL, its entirely another to take lower ranked recruits and turn them into NFL draft picks, which is exactly what Henry has done. Imagine what he’s going to do with top-level players, it’s’ going to be impressive.\n\nNotre Dame is expected to hire Illinois @AaronHenry7 as it's next DB Coach.\n\nHere he is Mic'd up so you can get a feel. \n\nPlaces he's coached:\nFIU, Arkansas, Rutgers, NC State, Vanderbilt, Baylor, Illinois. \n\nIn 2022 he created the #1 scoring defense at Illinois. Without elite… pic.twitter.com/c7egECSEjG\n\n— CathVSConf☘️ (@CathVSConf) February 1, 2026\n\nJust a few years ago, Henry coached the top scoring defense in the country. There is no doubt in my mind that he can get Notre Dame close to that level too.\n\nThis is a chess move. Ash is probably gone after next year and Marcus can just remove the co- tag https://t.co/ljViGNwhBQ\n\n— Brendan (@verypiratey) February 1, 2026\n\nWith what Ash did last fall, and what he’s expected to do this season, there could be multiple teams looking to poach him from South Bend after the year ends. It would be a smooth transition to make Henry the full-time defensive coordinator if Ash does move on.\n\nI’m sorry, did we just pull a Defensive Coordinator from the B1G to be our DBs coach? 👀 https://t.co/Pgp55I7l2r\n\n— The 4 Horsemen Podcast (@HorsemenPod) February 1, 2026\n\nHenry will be more than just a defensive backs coach, but it’s still very impressive that Notre Dame pulled off this feat. Call it the Freeman-effect, as coaches see that he’s a superstar in the making.\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Social reactions to Notre Dame expected to hire Aaron Henry as co-DC",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (DC News Now) — In their Morgan State college dorm in the mid-1990’s, Daronte Jones and Melvin Coleman stayed busy.\n\n“We did a lot of battles in Madden,” Coleman told DC News Now. “I’d be in the bed asleep it would be a Saturday and [Daronte] would walk and grab the controller and put the controller by my bed and soon I’d wake up and he’d jump back in like I don’t see him and be like, ‘oh so what you calling me out?”\n\nIn January, three decades after his Madden battles as a college football player with his roommate, and many professional and college football coaching stops, Jones has been hired as the Washington Commanders new defensive coordinator.\n\nFor Jones – it’s a homecoming. He hails from Prince George’s County, where he attended Bishop McNamara high school in Forestville, Maryland.\n\nIt’s not just his college friends and teammates who remember the Madden matchups. His good friend and teammate from Bishop McNamara Mike Jones also took part in the legendary video games matchups – though he didn’t know at the time he was facing a defensive mastermind.\n\n“He’s definitely the reason why I stopped playing Madden,” Mike said. “Cause he’s reading all your plays and this was the time when he was early in his coaching career… I’m like dude I’m playing for leisure.”\n\nDuring his college career, Daronte suffered a neck injury that kept him off the field. Coleman said Daronte would spend more time in the play calling booth during games and was earning a bigger grasp of the game. He said it showed in Madden too.\n\n“That kind of helped us being coaches and our playing careers were done,” Coleman said. “We learned how to think on the run, think quick, make adjustments quick.”\n\nYou could call Daronte’s coaching career the Daronte Jones World Tour.\n\nIt started in 2001 as a graduate assistant at Division II Lenoir-Rhyne. Coleman said Daronte conducted an interview with the school before they went on their spring break trip senior year. The following years took Jones to Nicholls State (then Division I-AA) as safeties coach, defensive coordinator jobs at high schools in Louisiana and his first return to the DMV where he served as Bowie State’s assistant head coach and defensive coordinator from 2005 to 2009.\n\nJones bounced around more after that. He was cornerbacks coach at UCLA in 2010, defensive backs coach for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League in 2011, Hawaii’s secondary coach in 2012-14 and Wisconsin’s defensive backs coach in 2015.\n\nThen, Jones made the jump to the NFL — first as the Miami Dolphins assistant defensive backs coach, then the Cincinnati Bengals cornerbacks coach, then the Minnesota Vikings defensive backs coach. After a brief stint as LSU’s defensive coordinator in 2021 where he coached star cornerback Derek Stingley Jr., Jones returned to the Vikings, where he stayed until this offseason.\n\n“For most people who think that this is a person who’s coming out of nowhere, that’s not true,” Mike Jones said. “This guy has been grinding close to over 20 years. He’s been grinding and getting information from the best minds in football.”\n\nFor Mike and Coleman, watching Daronte flourish in the football world has been meaningful, but they’ve also seen his growth as a coach.\n\n“Secondary wise, pass defense wise, everywhere he’s gone they’ve gotten better,” Coleman, who is now the safeties coach at Morgan State said. “Somebody is doing well, somebody is probably making the pro bowl. Somebody is probably making all-conference. So the proof is in the work.”\n\nSince 2023, Daronte had worked directly under Brian Flores in Minnesota. Coleman said that Daronte’s coaching influences and style comes from several different legendary coaching trees.\n\n“With him being around [Vic] Fangio, Marvin Lewis, [Mike] Zimmer, Vance Joseph and now Flores,” Coleman said. “He’s got a lot work from them. He got a lot of tape to take from them.”\n\nIn recent seasons, with Daronte serving as the team’s defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator, the Vikings’ defense has played aggressively, focusing on trying to force turnovers and blitzing at some of the highest rates in the NFL.\n\nDaronte’s high school teammate Mike Jones, who is now a counselor at Bishop McNamara says the way he played was pretty similar to how his defenses play.\n\n“He was always in the right spot… When we look at those old films when we get together, he pops on film,” Mike said. “He’s always going all out.”\n\nMike said Daronte earned the nickname “Crow” because “he made crow sounds in the backfield.”\n\n“He would make these crow sounds like he’s lurking in the secondary,” Mike said. “He would take on the biggest person on the team in practice even though he was gonna get knocked down… He’s not scared.”\n\nAccording to his friends, Daronte’s days at McNamara mean a lot to him. Several years ago, Daronte donated to the Bishop McNamara football program. His contributions provide student athletes with scholarship assistance. Daronte’s name is now etched on a plaque in the McNamara locker room, noted him as a 1996 graduate and that year’s male athlete of the year. Daronte played football, wrestling and track & field at McNamara.\n\n“He’s been able to come back and give back to the community itself in terms of the program and the school,” Bishop McNamara football head coach Greg Calhoun said. “But he’s also been able to take advantage of the opportunities to give back.”\n\nCalhoun told DC News Now that he referenced Daronte as inspiration and motivation for his players and as an example to potential recruits.\n\n“I actually just had a set of recruits come through and we just showed his locker again as we always do,” Calhoun said. “A lot of great coaches out here in the world but for him to be selected for that job and that opportunity in this community, is huge.”\n\nBishop McNamara plays in one of, if not the best high school football conferences in the country, the WCAC. The Mustangs last won a WCAC championship in 1990. Since, the conference has been dominated by blue blood programs DeMatha, Gonzaga, St. John’s and Good Counsel.\n\nBut in 2025, months before Daronte being hired by the Commanders, a few seasons into his tenure in Forestville, Calhoun helped his team take a massive step forward. The Mustangs beat their rival Gonzaga, 21-0 on October 11. Gonzaga was the eventual WCAC runners-up.\n\nThe following week, McNamara fell just short to eventual undefeated WCAC champion DeMatha, 12-7. They were one of two teams to come within five points or less of the Stags all season long. It was also DeMatha’s second lowest scoring output of the season.\n\n“We’re not always the first names mentioned in that league,” Mike said. “Now we have something that we can definitely hang our hat on in conversations… Now we have the defensive coordinator of our local team.”\n\nCalhoun believes that an esteemed alum calling plays down the road, could further fuel his players.\n\n“Just knowing that you have somebody of that magnitude at that level kind of puts that pressure on you obviously as the current student in that process, just letting you know you have some big shoes to fill,” Calhoun told DC News Now. “You have some expectations, you have some standards and that’s something that we work to build here in this process and our guys take pride and value in that.”\n\nAnd while Daronte rises in the football coaching ranks, he’s still a boy from Prince George’s County, Maryland.\n\n“I know growing up, everybody was like DC, DC, DC, but now it’s like PG County,” Coleman said. “We’ve got players, we’ve got ballers, we’ve got good thinkers and I think it’s just you’re proud to represent where you’re from.”\n\nAs for what Commanders fans should expects going forward, Coleman said Daronte is “a guy that’s going to be on a mission to be great. To not lose.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s jokes at an elite closed-door Washington, D.C., event bombed so badly that “the room fell silent repeatedly,” The Washington Post reported Sunday.\n\nThe awkwardness happened Saturday night at the Alfalfa Club dinner, an invitation-only event for some 200 of the rich and powerful who gather together each year on Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee’s birthday.\n\nAccording to The Post, it was the first time Trump addressed the club, “speaking before a room whose membership includes such foes as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon (whose bank he is suing), David Rubenstein (whom he fired as head of the Kennedy Center) and Jerome H. Powell (the outgoing Fed chairman whose role he is investigating).”\n\nAn anonymous source told The Post that some of Trump’s jokes “landed with a thud, and the room fell silent repeatedly.”\n\nTrump began his remarks by declaring, “So many people in the room I hate. Most of you I like,” Trump said, before adding, “Who in the hell thought this was going to happen?”\n\nTrump then warned the crowd that he might “cut the speech short” so he could watch “the invasion of Greenland,” before revealing that he was just joking.\n\n“We’re not going to invade Greenland. We’re going to buy it,” Trump said, according to the report. “It’s never been my intention to make Greenland the 51st state. I want to make Canada the 51st state. Greenland will be the 52nd state. Venezuela can be 53rd.”\n\nTrump dropped several off-color comments about his political adversaries, according to attendees. He described calling Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) “Pocahontas” in reference to her claims of Native American heritage. She was supposed to be at the dinner, he said, “but couldn’t find her reservation.” He mentioned that Condoleezza Rice was also in the audience and said he always thought she would be the first female president. “Never in a million years would I have thought Joe Biden would beat her to it,” he added, suggesting that former first lady Jill Biden was the true president in a barb that also appeared to bomb with guests.\n\nAfter the event, Trump flew to his Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, FL, for White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino’s wedding, scheduled to be held Sunday.\n\nThe post Trump Reportedly Bombed His Speech at Closed-Door Black Tie DC Dinner: ‘Jokes Landed With a Thud’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "(refiles to fix hyperlinks in paragraph 8, 14)\n\nDUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Iran's leadership warned of a regional conflict on Sunday if the U.S. were to attack it, stoking the tension between Washington and Tehran, and it ​designated EU armies as \"terrorist groups\" in a retaliatory move.\n\nThe United States has ramped up its naval presence in the ‌Middle East after President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with intervention if it did not agree to a nuclear deal or failed to stop killing protesters.\n\nDespite the ‌standoff between Iran's clerical rulers and the Trump administration, both sides have signalled they are ready to resume talks, and regional allies such as Turkey have sought de-escalation.\n\nAn Iranian official denied an earlier report by state-run Press TV that the Revolutionary Guards' naval forces would carry out live-fire exercises in the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday and Monday, telling Reuters they have no such plan and the media ⁠reports are wrong.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ‌was quoted on state media as saying that although Trump says he has sent ships to the region, \"the Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things, the Iranian people will not be stirred ‍by these threats\".\n\n\"We are not the initiators and do not want to attack any country, but the Iranian nation will strike a strong blow against anyone who attacks and harasses them,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Navy currently has six destroyers, one aircraft carrier, and three littoral combat ships in ​the region, raising the risk of war after Iran's deadly crackdown in January on nationwide protests against Iranian leadership.\n\nTrump was weighing ‌options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces, Reuters has reported, citing multiple sources.\n\nOn Saturday Trump told reporters that Iran was \"seriously talking\" with Washington, hours after Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that arrangements for negotiations were underway.\n\nTrump also said: \"I hope they negotiate something acceptable. You could make a negotiated deal that would be satisfactory with no nuclear weapons.\"\n\nTehran says it is ready for \"fair\" negotiations that do not seek to curtail its defensive capabilities.\n\nThe protests, which started over economic hardships but morphed ⁠into the most acute political challenge to the Islamic Republic since its ​establishment in 1979, have now abated after repression.\n\nOfficial numbers put the unrest-related death ​toll at 3,117, while U.S.-based HRANA rights group said on Sunday it had so far verified the death of 6,713 people. Reuters was unable to independently verify the numbers.\n\nIn a symbolic shift in response to ‍the crackdown on protests, the European ⁠Union on Thursday designated the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation.\n\nIn retaliation on Sunday, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said EU armies would also be designated as such, and that authorities would deliberate on the expulsion of EU ⁠states' military attachés.\n\n\"By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards... the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot\" the speaker told fellow lawmakers, who all wore IRGC ‌uniforms in support of the elite force.\n\nAfter his address, lawmakers shouted \"Death to America, Shame on you Europe\".",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "fullText": "Current Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz was in the running to be the next head coach for the Cleveland Browns. He was one of the three finalists for the job, but he was passed over for Todd Monken. Once it was announced that Schwartz wasn’t going to be the head man in charge, Schwartz seemed upset about missing out on another head coaching opportunity (this was the second time he was passed up on another head coaching spot; he was a finalist for the Browns job in 2020).\n\nPeople will blame the Browns for doing this to Schwartz, but in reality, the person who is not free of blame is Schwartz. The team is trying to keep Schwartz, but the relationship is damaged.\n\nThe relationship between the #Browns and DC Jim Schwartz will “need significant repairing” after he was passed over for the HC job, sources tell me. Schwartz is currently under contract but was anticipating getting the HC job.\n\nHe didn’t… and now there’s work to do. https://t.co/JQ9PncR6CP pic.twitter.com/PTezSh2qI7\n\n— Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) January 28, 2026\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles were considering Schwartz if Vic Fangio were to retire, which is still possible:\n\nSources: Eagles considered Jim Schwartz and Jonathan Gannon for defensive coordinator job after Vic Fangio retirement scare https://t.co/cCl7ZbcmfI\n\n— Jimmy Kempski (@JimmyKempski) February 1, 2026\n\nAs mentioned, the relationship needs to be repaired, but Schwartz is under contract for another year. If the Browns want to bring Schwartz back, it should be met with two options: come back and be a positive force this time, or early retirement.\n\nBoth parties aren’t free of blame for why this situation is the way it is, but Schwartz doesn’t deserve any sympathy. Schwartz acting the way he did when he was passed up on a job was considered unprofessional. Schwartz is likely not going to get another head coaching job, and it’s hard to see him finding another defensive coordinator job this year based on recent events.\n\nIs Schwartz a good defensive coordinator? Yes, but there is a large portion of Browns fans who overrate Schwartz. The Browns have been an elite defense under Schwartz, but in terms of scheme, it’s basic and the talent the team possesses defensively masks the flaws of the scheme. Not much complexity or exoticness, the scheme hasn’t evolved, and that falls on coaching. Most defensive coordinators would love to coach this unit if the job were to be available. Schwartz has no leverage in this situation.\n\nIt’s clear the team wants Schwartz backs and both sides need to come together to mend this relationship, but the Browns should draw a line in the sand to get their coaching staff in order as soon as possible.",

The race would be held on August 23 as part of a larger celebration of the 250th anniversary of American independence.\n\nAccording to an announcement shared by IndyCar, the executive order directs the \"White House Task Force on Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday\" to designate a route for the race. The full order, titled \"Celebrating American Greatness with American Motor Racing,\" was published on the White House website on Friday.\n\nAs an executive order is not itself law, the declaration is not the same as a completed plan to host an IndyCar race around the nation's capital. A tight seven-month timeline will make actually putting the event together a challenge, but a release shared by IndyCar quotes both D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, among other enthusiastic stakeholders working to make the event happen. That suggests some level of cooperation between the city and multiple departments of the presidential administration, greatly increasing the odds that the race comes together before the scheduled Summer date.\n\nNeither IndyCar nor the administration have shared a track layout for the potential race. All mentions of the race note it only as an event celebrating the 250th anniversary of independence, suggesting that this is meant to be a one-time event. That could make a high-profile route through the National Mall more plausible, although construction along a track in that area would still mean major interruptions at some of the country's most-visited tourist sites throughout Spring and Summer.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "fullText": "Radio: Huskies Gameday App, Sports Radio KJR\n\nBetting Line: Washington Huskies +12.5\n\nPoints For per Game: 85.5 (25th)\n\nPoints Against per Game: 68.3 (41st)\n\nAdjusted Offensive Efficiency: 130.4 (1st)\n\nAdjusted Defensive Efficiency: 99.1 (29th)\n\nG- Keaton Wagler, Fr. 6’6, 185: 17.5 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 4.0 apg, 47.7% FG, 43.5% 3pt, 82.6% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +8.6 BPR (22nd nationally)\n\nWagler is one of the all-time outliers in modern college basketball. He was the #150 ranked freshman in the class of 2025 and yet has clearly been a top-25 player in the entire country among all classes as demonstrated by his 46-point demolition of Purdue last weekend. Wagler is a 6’6 3-star freshman point guard who is 12th nationally in offensive efficiency. He hardly ever turns the ball over, is a lights out 3-point shooter, draws a ton of fouls, and can make every pass. Just an amazing season so far.\n\nG- Jake Davis, Jr. 6’6, 215: 4.8 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 0.7 apg, 44.0% FG, 41.5% 3pt, 75.0% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +3.9 BPR (406th nationally)\n\nDavis has been thrust into the starting lineup with the recent injury to starting guard Kylan Boswell. But that’s not necessarily that bad of a thing because Davis is 2nd(!) nationally in offensive efficiency. He absolutely never turns the ball over with just 2 giveaways all season and is the epitome of a 3-point sniper. Over 80% of his attempts this season have been from behind the arc and is a career 40% shooter to justify it. Davis has good size at 6’6 but adds almost nothing from a defense/rebounding standpoint so is exclusively a 5th option floor spacer. Still nice to have.\n\nF- Andrej Stojakovic, Jr. 6’7, 215: 13.9 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 1.1 apg, 50.0% FG, 26.3% 3pt, 81.8% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +4.5 BPR (279th nationally)\n\nStojakovic was the final piece of the puzzle for Illinois in the transfer portal after transferring from Stanford to Cal to now the Illini. The 3-point shot has just never really developed and is at a career low right now but it’s okay because Stojakovic has been great at the rim and in the midrange. The rebounding and steal numbers are lower than you’d like but he’s still clearly an additive player and has the length to bother opponents on the other end even if he isn’t the best defender in the world.\n\nF- David Mirkovic, Fr, 6’9, 250: 12.2 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 2.6 apg, 47.4% FG, 37.5% 3pt, 80.6% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +7.0 BPR (72nd nationally)\n\nMirkovic was an offseason Euro import from Montenegro and has been a really nice addition for Illinois. His assist rate is really high for your average power forward and he’s both a very good rebounder and three-point shooter. His block rate is about what you’d expect for your average 6’4 shooting guard so he offers no rim protection but is big enough to still both Hannes Steinbach in that matchup.\n\nC- Tomislav Ivisic, Jr. 7’1, 255: 10.2 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 0.6 bpg, 49.2% FG, 36.8% 3pt, 70.4% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +7.0 BPR (70th nationally)\n\nThe key to the Illinois offense is the Croatian brother duo of Tomislav and Zvonimir Ivisic who combine to play nearly 100% of the center minutes for Illinois. Tomislav starts has been better on the offensive end while Zvonimir is 2nd in the country in block rate as the rim protector. Both are shooting at least 67% on 2-pointers and almost exactly 36% on 3-pointers which makes them wildly efficient.\n\nIt’s safe to say that the all-Balkan roster makeover has worked out pretty well for Illinois and head coach Brad Underwood. There were thoughts in the offseason that Illinois would end up with 5 of their top 6 players who have a last name ending in “ic”: Mihailo Petrovic, Andrej Stojakovic, David Mirkovic, Tomislav Ivisic, and Zvonimir Ivisic. The only player not of that background was projected to be Kylan Boswell (Stojakovic was born in the US but is the son of former Serbian NBA star Peja Stojakovic so you can’t so the only American).\n\nAlmost every aspect of that remodel has worked except for Petrovic. He hasn’t been close to a starting caliber point guard and has fallen out of the rotation thanks to a ton of turnovers and poor shooting. That might have doomed many teams to underachieve. Except enter Keaton Wagler.\n\nNo one could’ve predicted that a three-star freshman would not only start for Illinois at point guard but legitimately enter the All-American conversation and become a top-ten NBA draft pick. That just doesn’t happen. Wagler is the engine behind an offense that is not just #1 in the country per KenPom but the best in KenPom’s database which goes back to 1997. That will likely drop off a bit at some point but the Illini are an absolute machine.\n\nIt looked like Illinois might only be so-so after they dropped to 8-3 following a home loss to Nebraska. That loss obviously looks better in hindsight and Illinois has won 9 straight since then. They’re now 3-3 against top-20 KenPom teams and 14-0 against everyone else. Not exactly encouraging for Washington.\n\nAs mentioned above, the success revolves around the Illinois offense. They take over half of their shots from beyond the 3-point arc and play five legitimate shooting threats at almost all times. Illinois will absolutely bomb it from deep and shoot 36% as a team from that range. They’ve made at least 10 three-point shots in 11 of their last 12 games. That’s compared to Washington who have hit that mark just 3 times all season (although they notably did it in their last game against Oregon). The math says it’s really hard to out-shoot them.\n\nEven when Illinois does miss a shot, they get it back almost half the time. Illinois is 4th nationally in offensive rebounding rate thanks to being the tallest team in the country with a rotation made entirely of players 6’6 or taller that aggressively crash the glass. That usually leads to kick outs and more three-point attempts rather than easy putbacks but they do shoot 58.4% (25th nationally) on two-point shots when they do decide to shoot it from close range. Oh, and if you foul them then they make nearly 80% of their free throws which ranks 4th nationally.\n\nSo they take and make a lot of three-pointers. And when they miss they get it back at an elite rate. And when they take close shots or get fouled they make them at an elite rate. Maybe we can force turnovers against them? Nope. They also rank 34th in turnover percentage. The math says Illinois has a sizable advantage from every area on offense and that’s why they have the best offense in the country.\n\nThere are some weaknesses to exploit on defense relatively but not that many. Illinois being the tallest team in the country does mean that it’s really hard to be outright bad on defense. They can at least contest shots with their length at every position even if they don’t have the best athletes. The rebounding and blocked shot numbers are very good because of that.\n\nWhere Illinois has their biggest issue is their depth. With Boswell’s injury and Petrovic not living up to expectations it means this is basically a 7-man roster right now. The Ivisic brothers combine to take up essentially all 40 minutes at center and then only 6’9 Ben Humrichous is truly available to soak up minutes at the 3/4 with the guards otherwise playing just about the whole game. So that means just get Illinois in foul trouble, right?\n\nEasier said then done. Illinois knows they’ve got issues with depth and so they just don’t foul. They rank 1st in the country in opponent free throw rate. That’s not a great sign for Washington. The Huskies are 2-7 this year when they have a free throw rate on offense below 30%. Illinois gives up 19% on average. Washington absolutely needs a friendly whistle to have any shot at pulling an upset but it doesn’t seem likely.\n\nThe flip side of Illinois’ aversion to fouling is that they also don’t force turnovers. They’re dead last in opponent turnover rate and 2nd to last in steal rate on defense. If Washington is going to win this game then they need that trend to continue with 5 or fewer turnovers. The Huskies have to find ways to make up possessions knowing what a juggernaut Illinois is on offense and one of the only clear ways to do that is to keep from turning it over when UW has the ball. And oh yeah, they’re going to have shoot like they did against Oregon making close to 50% of their three-pointers.\n\nEarlier this week I looked into how brutal Washington’s schedule has been recently. The 7-game stretch culminating in this game is the 4th toughest for any team this season and they recently wrapped a 5-game stretch that was the toughest of any team in the entire country. Illinois is scorching hot. Washington got a feel good win this weekend to hopefully build some momentum but no one has gotten within 5 points of Illinois since December 13th. Things are set to turn around soon with the schedule lightening up but the best UW can hope for in this one is a late surge helping them cover the spread like they’ve done a few times recently. I’m not counting on it though\n\nWashington Huskies– 68, Illinois Fighting Illini- 85\n\nSeason picks: 14-6 straight up, 10-10 against the spread",

On the Bills' first second-half possession, linebacker Kurt Gouveia intercepted a Jim Kelly pass, nearly returning it for a touchdown.

OT Joe Jacoby, C Jeff Bostic, WR Art Monk, TE Don Warren, G Russ Grimm and LB Monte Coleman played on all four of those Gibbs teams.\n\nSince that time Washington head coaches have been Richie Petitbon, Norv Turner, Terry Robiskie, Marty Schottenheimer, Steve Spurrier, Joe Gibbs again (2004-2007), Jim Zorn, Mike Shanahan, Jay Gruden, Bill Callahan, Ron Rivera, and Dan Quinn.\n\nYes, a lot has changed for Washington in the last 34 years, sadly, even the name.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: 34 years ago was franchise's last Super Bowl",

    "fullText": "Venezuela’s acting president Delcy Rodríguez said Sunday she has had “enough” of Washington’s orders, as she works to unite the country after the US capture of its former leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nRodríguez has been walking a tight-rope since being backed by the US to lead the country in the interim; balancing keeping Maduro loyalists on board at home while trying to ensure the White House is happy.\n\nNow, almost a month into her new role, Rodríguez has pushed back on the US, amid ongoing pressure including a series of demands for Venezuela to resume oil production.\n\n“Enough already of Washington’s orders over politicians in Venezuela,” she told a group of oil workers in Puerto La Cruz city, at an event broadcast by state-run channel Venezolana de Televisión.\n\n“Let Venezuelan politics resolve our differences and our internal conflicts. This Republic has paid a very high price for having to confront the consequences of fascism and extremism in our country.”\n\nThe White House has maintained steady pressure on Venezuela since Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were seized in a raid in early January and taken to the US, where the former leader is facing charges.\n\nRodríguez, Maduro’s former deputy, has insisted in recent weeks that the US does not govern Venezuela but, equally, has not sought confrontation with Washington.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had claimed the US was “going to run” Venezuela in the immediate aftermath of Maduro’s capture, but he later backed Rodríguez as the country’s interim leader.\n\nCNN has contacted the White House for comment on Rodríguez’s latest statement.\n\nFor the past 25 years, oil-rich socialist Venezuela has been in constant confrontation with the US. But after deposing Maduro, Washington is now seeking to secure a stable source of authority in Caracas.\n\nInternally, the country remains divided among Maduro loyalists, left-wing opposition and “Chavistas No-Maduristas” – supporters of the late Hugo Chávez who reject Maduro, accusing him of betraying 21st-century socialist ideals.\n\nDays after the US strikes on Caracas in early January, the Trump administration outlined a number of demands that Venezuela must agree to, including cutting ties with China, Iran, Russia and Cuba, and agreeing to partner exclusively with the US on oil production, two senior White House officials told CNN at the time.\n\nRodríguez was also expected to prioritize the Trump administration and US oil companies for future oil sales.\n\nVenezuela’s main economic driver is oil. The country has the world’s largest reserves of extra-heavy crude, a variety that requires a more complex and expensive refining process but which is also compatible with US refineries.\n\nCNN’s Ivonne Valdes Garay, Isabelle D’Antonio, Rocio Muñoz-Ledo and Mauricio Torres contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "LONDON/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. control of Venezuela's oil exports has ensnared barrels that had been servicing debt to China, lining up another potential showdown between the two superpowers that could further complicate the South American country's path out of default.\n\nAround a tenth of Venezuela's $150 billion foreign debt pile is estimated to be loans from China that ​the OPEC member was paying in oil cargoes - until the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.\n\nDebt experts said the ramifications of China's claim on the cargoes and any clash with ‌the United States could make it tougher for Venezuela to restructure its debt after a 2017 default and put at risk Beijing's cooperation in restructuring deals for other developing nations.\n\n\"Even under the best circumstances, this was going to be very messy - trying to disentangle where all ‌these creditors stand in the credit hierarchy,\" said Christopher Hodge, chief economist with Natixis and a former U.S. Treasury official.\n\n\"The fact that now America is controlling all the finances into and out of the country...this seems to be unprecedented to me, that we're going to have such entanglements, such opacity about the finances of a government,\" Hodge said.\n\nWhile Washington currently controls only oil sale proceeds, Hodge noted that these are Venezuela's main source of revenue.\n\nDocuments and sources from state-run oil firm PDVSA show three supertankers have been shuttling between Venezuela and China over the last five years carrying oil for interest payments under the terms of a temporary deal struck in 2019. But these shipments are only ⁠a fraction of Venezuela's total crude exports to China.\n\nAidData, a research lab at ‌the U.S. university William & Mary that tracks lending, said some cash proceeds from oil sent to China went into an account controlled by Beijing and on to service the debt - even as sanctions and default blocked payments to many of Venezuela's other creditors.\n\nThe Trump administration has now said that proceeds from the sale of Venezuela's oil will go into ‍a Qatar-based account controlled by Washington, potentially giving the U.S. President himself substantial leverage over which creditors get paid, and when.\n\nIn response to a request for comment on the cargoes and debt payments, China's foreign ministry said Beijing \"has repeatedly stated its position\".\n\nBeijing condemned the redirection of Venezuelan oil exports during a January 7 news conference, adding \"legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected\".\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Reuters that Trump had brokered an oil deal with Venezuela ​that \"will benefit the American and Venezuelan people\".\n\nThe Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at the \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which Caracas sold the crude previously, a U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nTraders managing Venezuelan oil ‌sales have offered some to Chinese refiners, but these are private market transactions, not intended as debt payments.\n\n\"The people of Venezuela will collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations,\" the U.S. official said.\n\nThe Venezuelan communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nTrump could yet make a deal with China. However, the planned U.S. takeover of Venezuela's oil sector and control of its revenue could upend the hierarchy of creditors, restructuring advisors warn.\n\n\"All of these things will have the practical effect of subordinating the claims of legacy debtholders,\" said global sovereign debt expert Lee Buchheit, adding it was unclear if Trump had the legal right to determine who gets paid first.\n\nSome $60 billion of Venezuela's bonds tipped into default in 2017, and a restructuring agreement is essential to enable it to borrow again and attract new ⁠investment.\n\nIn a typical restructuring, bilateral lenders come together and agree what losses they will accept, usually via the Paris Club of ​creditor nations. This sets the bar for the \"comparable\" losses private lenders - bond investors, banks and others - must take.\n\n\"Comparability of treatment will be ​a real challenge, particularly if the U.S. controls the use of oil revenues,\" said Mark Walker, a longtime sovereign debt advisor who previously worked on potential Venezuelan restructurings.\n\nIf the U.S. pushes China to swallow significant writedowns on its debt - and China digs its heels in - it could slow a restructuring and hinder Venezuela's economic recovery in the process.\n\nThat could ‍keep Venezuela \"in very dire straits during the foreseeable future\", said ⁠Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging market debt with TT International, which holds Venezuelan bonds. In turn, this would limit how much the country can afford to repay to bondholders and other creditors.\n\nChina has little immediate leverage. Countries typically do not take other nations to court or arbitration over lending claims, Walker said, and would need to settle the situation \"on a government-to-government basis\".\n\nBut ramifications are possible: China is the ⁠largest bilateral lender to the developing world and its cooperation with the Paris Club has been crucial over the past decade. Beijing agreed restructuring terms via a platform called the Common Framework during Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia's debt restructuring talks.\n\n\"China's obvious leverage is to refuse ‌to cooperate in future Common Framework sovereign debt workouts until it feels that it has been treated fairly in Venezuela,\" Buchheit said. \"And that threat would have some force.\"",

On a clearer day, I likely would have been able to see more aircraft in the sky.\n\nPlanes take off into the wind for extra lift. Landing into the wind helps them reduce speed.\n\nI could hear air traffic controllers instructing flights to turn certain directions or use certain runways at Dulles, but much of it was jargon meant for pilots.\n\nThe exhibit included a lighting control panel depicting airport runway layouts known as a \"mimic,\" a vacuum tube from a vintage communication radio, and a light gun used to communicate with pilots via lighting signals if radio isn't available.\n\nWhile touring the museum, my guide pointed out the Boeing 367-80 Jet Transport known as \"Dash 80.\" The only model of its kind ever built, the Dash 80 first took off in 1954 and was eventually developed into the first Boeing 707 jetliner, ushering in a new era of commercial air travel.\n\nAfter viewing the museum's vast collection of historic planes, watching passenger jets take off and land at Dulles gave me a deeper appreciation of how much — and how quickly — aviation has changed.

    "fullText": "In cities across Australia, fleets of nice-looking electric buses quietly ferry thousands of commuters each day. But new warnings from cybersecurity experts have transformed what once looked like a clean energy success story into a geopolitical flashpoint.\n\nOfficials in Australia and the United Kingdom now say some Chinese-made buses may contain code that theoretically lets the buses’ manufacturer shut them down remotely via a so-called “kill switch.”\n\nThe revelation has renewed global fears about foreign-controlled technology embedded in critical infrastructure.\n\nThe spotlight is on the Yutong-made battery-electric buses. It’s a major Chinese manufacturer whose vehicles have been widely purchased in Australia’s capital, Canberra, and other jurisdictions.\n\nBritish reports, citing tests by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and Transport for the UK government, found that similar models in Europe could be accessed remotely by the manufacturer’s systems, including diagnostics and software updates, and that, theoretically, such access could be used to stop a bus’s drive system.\n\nThis marks a dramatic escalation in cyber-risk warnings tied that aren’t about phone networks or internet routers but about public transit vehicles. Transport Canberra reportedly responded by launching a fresh investigation into cybersecurity risks linked to the buses, following the British analysis and earlier flags from Norwegian transit authorities who found what they termed a functional remote shutdown capability during tests.\n\nTo cyber researchers, the worry is not that a Chinese government operator is now flipping switches in real time, since there aren’t any confirmed cases of foreign actors actively disabling buses. The concern is that the vulnerability exists at all in imported vehicles that operate on public streets and, in some cases, carry government employees and personnel.\n\n“This isn’t just about buses,” Australian cybersecurity expert Alastair MacGibbon told local media. “It goes to how much control is embedded in the technology we import, and whether those controls could be abused.”\n\nThis episode in neighboring Australia (ally, we mean) reads like vindication for policymakers in the US who have long sounded the alarm over dependencies on Chinese technology.\n\nTransport Secretary Sean Duffy and other hardliners have repeatedly asserted that Chinese-linked vehicles and connected technologies pose unacceptable security risks — even going so far as to say China should never sell cars (or similarly connected vehicles) on American roads “as long as I have breath in my body.”\n\nWhile those comments were dismissed as bluster by critics, the Australian “kill-switch” story has suddenly given them a concrete, globally reported incident to point to.\n\nIn Washington, the Biden administration tightened restrictions on connected vehicles containing Chinese software or hardware, with new rules designed to ban such imports by model year 2027 — a response to precisely the kinds of national security vulnerabilities highlighted by the Australian case.\n\nOpponents of these policies argue that connectivity features, including remote diagnostics and over-the-air updates, are standard across the global auto and transit industries, not unique to Chinese manufacturers.\n\nIndeed, any modern vehicle with internet connectivity might in theory be accessed remotely, whether made in Beijing, Detroit, or Tokyo. Critics in China have taken to global media to warn that U.S. bans could backfire by raising costs and supply chain challenges for American automakers dependent on global components.\n\nBut for many U.S. national security experts, the defining issue isn’t simply connectivity but control. If a foreign company can access the mission-critical systems of vehicles running on public streets — or the energy grids, solar inverters, or AI systems that undergird modern life — then that access becomes a lever that adversaries could exploit during crises.\n\nThe Australian episode has already spurred official reviews of every Yutong model in service. Transport Canberra officials insist there is no immediate operational concern based on current investigations, and that local buses are updated via physical service centers rather than remote connectivity.\n\nBut the warning’s broader resonance has rippled through capitals from London to Canberra, Oslo to Washington: as nations electrify their transit fleets and embrace connected vehicles, they must also reckon with who controls that connectedness.\n\nAnd for American lawmakers who warned loudly (and, in the eyes of some, prematurely) that Chinese technology on wheels isn’t just another import, this moment may well feel like a long-anticipated reckoning.",

    "description": "Specific Washington Commanders' jerseys are on clearance, which means the old look could become the permanent new look.",
    "fullText": "Thanks to quarterback Jayden Daniels, it became cool to buy Washington Commanders NFL jerseys in 2024. Every time the NFL released a different Daniels' jersey, whether it was the black alternate, the new Super Bowl era jerseys they brought back in 2025, or Salute to Service, they were a big hit.\n\nNow, if you're looking to buy a Daniels' jersey — or any Washington jersey outside of the Super Bowl era throwbacks, you can find them on clearance.\n\nNo, it's not because the Commanders were 5-12 in 2025. Or because fans are still protesting over the name. Instead, it's because Washington's current jerseys will be going away in 2026. The Super Bowl-era throwbacks will likely become the Commanders' permanent uniforms.\n\nX user Zach Cohen often posts on NFL uniforms and designs and released the following video on Thursday:\n\nLet's do this one better... only 4 NFL teams have similarly discounted jerseys on all current players online & in-person at Dick's 🚨\n- Commanders: all except white \"throwbacks\"\n- Falcons: all except black throwbacks\n- Ravens: all \n- Titans: all\n\nNot only are those 4 teams I… https://t.co/kAR7LXDwVB pic.twitter.com/5EIqAMYsd4\n\n— Zach Cohen (@ZachCohenFB) January 22, 2026\n\nCohen is often spot-on when reporting about jerseys and uniforms. And he's right about the discounted price on Commanders' jerseys on Fanatics.\n\nThe Commanders' jerseys were introduced in 2022 when they changed their name. They've never been popular. The jerseys, specifically the burgundy and the black jerseys, were more popular than the white ones. Still, most fans longed for something resembling the franchise's historic past. That's why the Super Bowl-era uniforms were introduced in 2025.\n\nThe longstanding rumor is that these uniforms will become permanent in 2026. The Commanders would also introduce a burgundy jersey resembling the ones they wore as the Redskins. That would explain why each of the jerseys introduced in 2022 is on clearance: they could be going away.\n\nSo, if you want to find a Jayden Daniels or Terry McLaurin jersey, now could be the time.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Clearance jerseys are good news for throwbacks",

    "fullText": "United States forward Trinity Rodman has signed a new three-year deal with the National Women's Soccer League's Washington Spirit that will reportedly make her the world's highest-paid woman footballer.\n\nThe Spirit announced the signing in a statement on Thursday, calling it \"one of the most significant contracts in the NWSL and the women's game worldwide, reflecting both Rodman's elite status and the Spirit's role as a global standard-bearer in women's soccer.\"\n\nESPN and The Athletic reported the deal is worth more than $2 million annually, including bonuses.\n\nHer agent, Mike Senkowski of Upper 90 Sports Group, told both outlets it will make her the highest-paid female player in the world.\n\nRodman, daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman, was drafted at the age of 18 in 2021 and earned Rookie of the Year honors as the Spirit won their first NWSL title.\n\nShe has won Olympic gold, and while the Spirit fell in the past two NWSL title matches, the club has made retaining her a priority.\n\n\"I knew this was where I wanted to enter the next chapter of my career,\" Rodman said in a statement. \"I'm proud of what we've built since my rookie season, and I'm excited about where this club is headed.\n\n\"We're chasing championships and raising the standard, and I can't wait to keep doing that with my teammates and the best fans in the NWSL.\"\n\nThe path to re-sign Rodman, whose previous contract expired on December 31, hasn't been smooth.\n\nA four-year deal that would have paid Rodman significantly \n\nThe NWSL Players Association responded by filing a grievance against the league on Rodman's behalf.\n\nIn December, the league's board of governors approved the creation of a new High Impact Player rule, allowing teams to spend up to $1 million beyond the salary cap on certain stars in a bid to keep them in the league.\n\nESPN had reported that Rodman had offers from overseas clubs, notably in England.\n\n\"Trinity is a generational player, but more importantly, she represents the future of this club and the future of women's soccer,\" Spirit owner Michele Kang said. \"This agreement reflects our belief that elite talent deserves elite commitment.\"",

    "title": "Eagles, NFL free agents who may follow DC Christian Parker to Cowboys",
    "description": "A look at 20 free agents who have played for a defense with Parker as a coach, and how each performed in 2025.",
    "fullText": "One of the oldest tenets in the NFL is that players tend to follow the coaches who have had positive impacts on their development. With Christian Parker in line to become the next Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator, and with his glowing reputation as a teacher and tactician, it is fair to wonder which former players could be joining him in Dallas.\n\nFans know, the club is in dire need of additional defensive talent. And while Parker is moving up to playcaller for the first time in his career, his relationships with players doesn't necessarily have to be limited to secondary players just because he was the defensive passing game coordinator. There could absolutely be linebackers who have been involved in those meetings who are interested in working for the 34-year old under the bright lights in Dallas.\n\nThe first glimpse is to who are pending free agents within the Philadelphia Eagles organization but things don't stop there. Parker also coached with the Denver Broncos from 2021 through 2023, and players from that era could still easily be able to contribute in 2026.\n\nUnfortunately for the Cowboys, the players who likely have most benefitted from Parker's tutelage are either still under their rookie deals with the Eagles, or have signed on long-term with their team.\n\nPatrick Surtain II: First-team All-Pro\nQuinyon Mitchell: First-team All-Pro\nCooper DeJean: First-team All-Pro\n\n... and all before Christian Parker turns 35. \n\nwelcome to the #Cowboys, sir. https://t.co/vmUEdicnZM\n\n— Patrik [No C] Walker (@VoiceOfTheStar) January 22, 2026\n\nHere's a rundown of the top potential free agents who could now be in the mix in Dallas, tiered by their 2025 Pro Football Focus overall defensive grades.\n\nCB Ja'Quan McMillian (RFA), Denver, 2022-23, 80.3 grade in 2025\n\nMcMillian is a former UDFA who has been a staple in the Denver secondary. They will most likely slap him with a 1st round or 2nd round tender, taking him off the market.\n\nSafety Avonte Maddox, Detroit, 2024, 79.1 grade in 2025\n\nMaddox had an incredible single season in Detroit, but didn't fare as well in Philly. He had a 61.9 overall grade in his one season working with Parker.\n\nSafety CJ Gardner-Johnson, Philadelphia, 2024, 51.4 grade in 2025\n\nNot a great year for Gardner-Johnson in Chicago, but he did have a 77.0 grade w/ Parker in 2024.\n\nLB Justin Strnad, Denver, 2021-23, 72.1 grade in 2025\n\nStrnad barely played while Parker was in Denver, but that doesn't mean they didn't have a chance to form some level of working relationship. Now that he's getting, he's an intriguing option for the Cowboys to fill out their linebacker core with.\n\nCB Fabian Moreau, Minnesota, 2023, 71.4\n\nMoreau has a strong grade, but only played 198 snaps in 2025 as a reserve. Could definitely be added as a depth piece to help round out the roster if Parker liked what he saw their one year together in 2023; Moreau graded out at 62.4 on 739 snaps.\n\nLB Alex Singleton, Denver, 2022-23, 70.1\n\nSingle had a strong first year in Denver with Parker in 2022, his highest graded of his six seasons at 79.1.\n\nSafety PJ Locke, Denver, 2021-23, 63.0\n\nNothing much stands out with Locke, who has mostly been a reserve, but he did have 3 sacks on 11 pash rush snaps in 2023 with Parker.\n\nLB Nakobe Dean, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 62.2\n\nDean has generally been regarded as a bust with the Eagles, but when he got starter snaps through the year in 2024 with Parker, he had a 77.4 grade, including a strong year in both run defense and pass rush.\n\nThose aren't the only back-seven players who are on the free agent market this year, but they are the ones who turned in average-or-better performances. Here's a look at other free agent linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties with ties to Parker.\n\nCB Adoree' Jackson, Philadelphia, 2025, 53.6 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Marcus Epps, Philadelphia, 2025, 51.8 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Reed Blankenship, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 42.6 grade in 2025\n\nLB Ben Van Sumeren (RFA), Philadelphia, 2024-25, N/A\n\nLB Josey Jewell, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Justin Simmons, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Kareem Jackson, Out of the League, 2021-22\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Eagles, NFL free agents who may follow DC Christian Parker to Cowboys",

He notes there is often a large gap between model output and actual accumulation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Winter Storm Watches stretched across a large part of the country, with more than 175 million people potentially in the storm’s path.\n\nBarnes also warns that frigid Arctic air trailing the storm could freeze any snow or ice that falls, raising the risk of power outages and potentially disrupting travel for days.\n\nStay ahead of the snow with FOX 5’s expert meteorologists, streaming LIVE on FOX LOCAL.

His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico sent 37 cartel members to the United States at the request of the U.S. Justice Department, with President Claudia Sheinbaum saying Wednesday that it was a “sovereign decision” by her government.\n\nSheinbaum responded to criticism from analysts and opponents who said that the transfers on Tuesday were the result of mounting pressure from Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to take military action on cartels.\n\nSheinbaum said that although the transfers were made at the request of the U.S. government, the decision was taken by the National Security Council after analyzing what was “convenient for Mexico” and in terms of its “national security.”\n\n“Mexico is put first above all else, even if they ask for whatever they have to ask for. It is a sovereign decision,” she said at her regular morning news briefing.\n\nSheinbaum, who has been praised for her level-headed management of relations with Trump, has been forced to walk a fine line between making concessions to the Trump administration and projecting strength both domestically and internationally.\n\nObservers say that the Mexican government has used the transfers as a sort of pressure valve to offset demands by Trump and show authorities are cracking down on criminal groups. Tension has only mounted since the U.S. carried out a military operation in Venezuela to capture then President Nicolás Maduro to face charges in the United States in an extraordinary use of force that set leaders across Latin America on edge.\n\nThose sent to the U.S. on Tuesday were alleged members of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, known by its Spanish acronym CJNG, and the Sinaloa Cartel, which Washington has designated as terrorist organizations, and a number of other groups. It’s the third such transfer of capos over the past year. Mexico’s government said it has sent 92 people in total to the U.S. in total.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday said that the transfer was a “landmark achievement in the Trump administration’s mission to destroy the cartels.”\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said that the move was an “important step” by Mexico's government and that collaboration was in both countries' shared interest.\n\n“These 37 cartel members — including terrorists from the Sinaloa Cartel, CJNG, and others – will now pay for their crimes against the American people on American soil,” Bondi said in a statement with other U.S. Justice Department officials.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said it had already indicted at least one of the people transferred, Armando Gómez Núñez, who was accused of being a senior leader of CJNG. He is charged with drug offenses and the possession of weapons like machine guns and “explosive devices.”\n\nIn August, Mexico's security minister acknowledged that some of the cartel leaders sent to the United States at that time were continuing criminal operations from prison and that their transfer was agreed upon because there was a risk they could be released because of judicial rulings.\n\nMatthew Lee contributed to this report from Washington.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "description": "Robert Saleh has history with Cowboys d-line coach Aaron Whitecotton",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans have just made 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh their next head coach. That may seem like a weird news post for a Cowboys blog, but the ripple effect could impact Dallas’ search for its next defensive boss. Current defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton, who is among the interviewed candidates for the DC job, may be on Saleh’s wishlist for his staff in Tennessee.\n\nWhen Saleh was the head coach of the New York Jets from 2021-2024, Whitecotton was his defensive line coach. After Saleh was fired two years ago, Whitecotton was able to make the lateral move to coach the defensive front in Dallas. He was attractive to the Cowboys based on excellent results with the Jets’ defense, particularly helping Quinnen Williams to become an All-Pro talent among other strong performers. When Dallas traded for Williams last October, he was clearly excited to reunite with Whitecotton.\n\nThe relationship between Saleh and Whitecotton runs deeper than the Jets tenure. They were both part of Gus Bradley’s staff in Jacksonville from 2014-2016, when Saleh was the linebackers coach and Whitecotton was just getting started as a d-line assistant. When Saleh left to become the 49ers’ DC, Whitecotton ended up in Buffalo for a few years. But Saleh brought him on staff in 2020, and then Whitecotton followed him to New York the following year. So there’s already been a point where, after time apart, they started working together again.\n\nGiven all this history, it would be no surprise if Saleh would like to resume their collaboration. But for that to happen, it would likely only come by making him the Jets’ defensive coordinator. Whitecotton is still under contract with Dallas and, unlike most other assistants, wasn’t one of Matt Eberflus’ guys. Considering the Cowboys have considered him for their own DC vacancy, they will almost certainly be retaining him as the defensive line coach at the very least. In that case, the only way New York could get him without Dallas’ consent is through a promotion.\n\nThe hire makes sense beyond just the relationship. Saleh has already made it clear that he plans to be the defensive play-caller in Tennessee. That could be attractive to Whitecotton as a first-time coordinator, allowing him to focus more on the other duties of the job initially. Saleh likely intends to be very hands-on with the defense in multiple ways, so a new coordinator with an existing rapport would be a great fit for that.\n\nAdmittedly, we are making the assumption that Robert Saleh would want Aaron Whitecotton back, and that Whitecotton would want to work for him. Hopefully, if they do reunite, it means the Cowboys only have to replace their defensive line coach. We don’t know where Whitecotton ranked on their list of defensive coordinator candidates, with plenty of outside guys being interviewed as well. But as this coaching carousel continues to spin, this is one horse that could impact what happens in Dallas and is worth watching.",

    "description": "Tennessee has landed a defensive-minded coach to lead its next era. Here's a look on why Saleh appealed to the Titans.",
    "fullText": "Why did the Titans hire Robert Saleh? Former 49ers DC, Jets head coach lands in Tennessee to lead Cam Ward originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans have found their next voice to lead Cam Ward.\n\nRobert Saleh is finalizing a deal with the Titans to become their next head coach, Adam Schefter reported late Monday night. The news comes after Saleh completed two official interviews with the team, and \"the two sides impressed each other enough to move forward together,\" per Schefter.\n\nNow, Saleh, the San Francisco 49ers’ defensive coordinator in 2025 and former New York Jets head coach, will be tasked with helping the Titans return to prominence in the AFC after multiple seasons of struggles, with a franchise quarterback already in place.\n\nHere’s what to know about the Titans hiring Saleh.\n\n3 reasons why every team remaining will (and won't) win Super Bowl\n\nInside the Patriots vs. Broncos AFC championship matchup\n\nPredicting the Super Bowl 60 matchup\n\nBreaking down Seahawks vs. Rams NFC championship matchup\n\nThe Titans' hire is set to be the fourth of the 2026 NFL coaching cycle, with John Harbaugh heading to the Giants, Kevin Stefanski heading to the Falcons and Jeff Hafley heading to the Dolphins. As Tennessee moved through its interview processes, it became apparent that Saleh was one of the favorites for the job.\n\nAccording to Schefter, Saleh spent Monday in Tennessee with the team, and \"the two sides impressed each other enough to move forward together.\" Ian Rapoport added that Saleh \" impressed during the interview process.\"\n\nMatt Nagy was also believed to be one of the top candidates for the Titans' head coaching role — the team announced Monday that it had completed second interviews with both Nagy and Saleh, two former head coaches.\n\nWe've completed in-person interviews with the following candidates. pic.twitter.com/Mctvgl2U5K\n\n— Tennessee Titans (@Titans) January 20, 2026\n\nInterestingly, Saleh, a defensive mind, was the choice over Nagy, an offensive mind. Saleh brings a mix of defensive prowess, leadership and head coaching experience to the Titans, an organization certainly needing stability after a 3-14 season.\n\nSaleh will be a head coach for the second time, as he led the Jets from 2021-24. That stint did not go too well — he racked up a 20-36 record — but Saleh wasn't always viewed as the sole person to blame for New York's struggles. At best, he helped bring more of an edge to the Jets, including his time leading Aaron Rodgers.\n\nAfter being fired five games into the 2024 season, Saleh wound up heading to the 49ers as Kyle Shanahan's defensive coordinator in the 2025 season, finding plenty of success despite a long list of injuries. The Titans were clearly impressed, now hoping Saleh can help them improve upon a defense that gave up 345.1 yards per game this past season.\n\nAccording to Jordan Schultz, Saleh indicated to teams in interviews that he planned to call defensive plays if he became a head coach again, which he did not do with the Jets.\n\nSaleh will also have an opportunity to join a hyped young quarterback, as Cam Ward had a quiet rookie season, but the Titans are hopeful last year's No. 1 overall pick will continue blossoming toward stardom.\n\nAs a side note, Saleh is now set to face Liam Coen's Jaguars squad twice per season. The two coaches had a bit of drama brewing earlier in the 2025 regular season:\n\nRobert Saleh and Liam Coen are now in the same division 🍿 pic.twitter.com/5lqCPszQ5phttps://t.co/yIt5IzERLK\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) January 20, 2026\n\nMORE:Everything to know about the Liam Coen-Robert Saleh beef\n\nDetails of Saleh's contract with the Titans have not yet been reported.\n\nNFL teams do not have to release details of their coaches' salaries, so it often comes down to whether or not those details are leaked to reporters.\n\nMORE: Why did Buffalo fire Sean McDermott?\n\nAll four of Saleh's seasons as an NFL head coach came with the Jets. Here's a look at his record in New York.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about the Falcons hiring Kevin Stefanski\n\nSaleh has had an extensive coaching career that includes time in college, a long list of NFL assistant roles, and now two head coaching jobs. Notably, he is set to coach his third AFC South team, having previously spent time with the Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars as an assistant.\n\nSaleh’s coaching career began in 2002 as an offensive assistant at Michigan State. He became a defensive assistant for the team in 2003, guiding defensive linemen, and the following year held the same role at Central Michigan.\n\nIn 2005, Saleh moved to Georgia as a defensive assistant leading linebackers. Later that year, he made the jump to the NFL as a defensive intern for the Texans. He became a defensive quality control coach for Houston from 2006–08, then an assistant linebackers coach from 2009–10.\n\nIn 2011, Saleh joined the Seattle Seahawks as a defensive quality control coach, remaining in that role until 2013, when he joined the Jaguars as a linebackers coach.\n\nSaleh’s first stint as the 49ers’ defensive coordinator began in 2017, helping lead the team to the Super Bowl in 2019. He served as San Francisco’s DC under Kyle Shanahan from 2017–20.\n\nIn 2021, the Jets hired Saleh as their head coach, but his four-year run did not result in any playoff appearances. New York built some solid defenses under Saleh but failed to break through, and after a 2-3 start in 2024, they parted ways with him.\n\nSaleh spent a bit of time as a consultant for the Packers before returning to the 49ers as defensive coordinator for the 2025 season. Now, he'll take on another head coaching role in the AFC.\n\nMichigan State, Offensive assistant and defensive assistant (2002-03)\n\nCentral Michigan, Defensive assistant (2004)\n\nGeorgia, Defensive assistant (2005)\n\nHouston Texans, Defensive intern, Defensive quality control coach and assistant LBs coach (2005-10)\n\nSeattle Seahawks, Defensive quality control coach (2011-13)\n\nJacksonville Jaguars, Linebackers coach (2014-16)\n\nSan Francisco 49ers, Defensive coordinator (2017-20)\n\nNew York Jets, Head coach (2021-24)\n\nGreen Bay Packers, Offensive consultant (2024)\n\nSan Francisco 49ers, Defensive coordinator (2025)\n\nTennessee Titans, Head coach (2026–present)\n\nRobert Saleh is 46 years old.

Late Monday night, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that the Titans and Saleh are working to finalize a deal to make the 49ers defensive coordinator their new head coach.\n\nESPN sources: Titans are working to finalize a deal to hire 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh as their head coach. Saleh spent Monday in Tennessee with the Titans, and the two sides impressed each other enough to move forward together. pic.twitter.com/rXC94my62B\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 20, 2026\n\nTennessee interviewed at least 15 candidates for the position, finishing up Saleh and Kansas City offensive coordinator Matt Nagy on Monday. Saleh was in Nashville to meet with the Titans and had a Tuesday meeting scheduled with the Cardinals regarding their head coaching vacancy.\n\nThree of Tennessee's targets for head coach signed with other teams just before they were scheduled to meet with the Titans. This time, it was Tennessee that locked up its guy.\n\nSaleh, 46, is a former New York Jets head coach who finished with a 20-36 record before being fired during the 2024 season. He returned to San Francisco in 2025, leading the 49ers to the NFC divisional round, despite being ravaged by injuries. Saleh was initially San Francisco's defensive coordinator from 2017-20 before he took over as head coach of the Jets.\n\nSaleh began his coaching career in 2002 at Michigan State. His first NFL job came in 2005 with the Houston Texans as a defensive intern. After six seasons with Houston, Saleh joined the Seattle Seahawks as a defensive quality control coach. He moved to Jacksonville in 2014 and served as linebackers coach for three seasons.\n\nNow, he's back in the AFC South.\n\nMany believed Nagy was general manager Mike Borgonzi's top choice from their shared time in Kansas City.

    "description": "The Washington Commanders and head coach Dan Quinn made another bold move, promoting Darnell Stapleton to offensive line coach.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders made a bold move on Monday, promoting assistant offensive line coach Darnell Stapleton to offensive line coach. This comes less than two weeks after head coach Dan Quinn promoted assistant quarterbacks coach David Blough to offensive coordinator.\n\nWhy is this a bold move? Blough had only two years of coaching experience when he was promoted. While many around the NFL, including everyone in Washington's building, believe the former NFL quarterback is a future coaching star, the 30-year-old had led only a position group for a couple of weeks late in the 2025 season, after Tavita Pritchard left to become Stanford's head coach.\n\nMany believed that after firing offensive line coach Bobby Johnson and parting ways with offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, the Commanders would look to bring in an experienced voice for Blough. Last week, Blough also hired former college teammate Danny Etling as the assistant quarterbacks coach, after hiring D.J. Williams to be the new quarterbacks coach.\n\nWashington reportedly likes Stapleton's ability to develop players, and he received internal praise for first-round pick Josh Conerly's growth as a rookie in 2025. Stapleton and Blough worked together as assistant position coaches and are said to have a strong rapport.\n\nWill this work for Washington? Only time will tell. Quinn is betting his future on it.\n\nHow did everyone receive the news that the Commanders promoted another young assistant coach? We surveyed some of the top reactions via X.\n\nMentioned Stapleton the other day on the podcast as a good possibility. Good rapport with the OL and was heavily involved in protection schemes and other aspects of the O. Aligned with Blough’s vision. https://t.co/LCBF5U1GXz\n\n— John Keim (@john_keim) January 19, 2026\n\nThe moves make sense in a lot of ways. Stapleton has a good rapport with OC David Blough, is well-liked by players and was involved in game planning and protection plans last season. https://t.co/6tKA0tCnuN\n\n— Nicki Jhabvala (@NickiJhabvala) January 19, 2026\n\nDan Quinn disliked the offense enough to part with Kliff Kingsbury & Bobby Johnson but liked the offense enough to promote David Blough, Darnell Stapleton & Shane Toub.\n\nNot saying any of this is wrong (there's a lot we don't know), but this is an unusual offensive-staff revamp.\n\n— Al Galdi (@AlGaldi) January 19, 2026\n\nWith Stapleton being promoted, I think we're about to see the Commanders become a much more zone-based run team. Will be interesting to see if they get under center more or lean more on the pistol\n\n— Mark Bullock (@MarkBullockNFL) January 19, 2026\n\nStapleton has been an OL coach in college & played in the pros\n\nToub has been working with OL as a QC coach, & was the team captain of his team at Dayton as a Center.\n\nBoth have OL credentials certainly, still feels odd team’s leaning so heavy on limited experience in the roles https://t.co/cvWopL4LXH\n\n— T “Resh” Manuel (@reshmanuel) January 19, 2026\n\nThis is an educated guess. Stapleton was part of zone team in college. Commanders OL is super athletic and suited to zone, so are the RBs & TEs.\n\nAlso, the briefing on Stapleton was \"involved in protection plans\", not run game. Run game under Kliff/Johnson was heavy gap scheme\n\n— Mark Bullock (@MarkBullockNFL) January 19, 2026\n\nThe #Commanders will essentially be rolling out the same offensive coaching staff MINUS Kliff Kingsbury and Tavita Pritchard.\n\nOn one hand, continuity is king for a young QB.\n\nOn the other, somewhat uninspiring hires with a cycle of good coaches out. 🤔#RaiseHail https://t.co/yOMYFuGhPa\n\n— George Carmi (@Gcarmi21) January 19, 2026\n\nYeah…. Just seems odd to promote the assistants under the guys that were let go and hoping for a more desirable outcome. pic.twitter.com/B3Y6GWhlnw\n\n— Filterle$$ 🗣🤌🏻🎙 (@tambascosauce69) January 19, 2026\n\nDarnell Stapleton will get a up close look at the OL on the National side in the senior bowl — pretty excited about that.\n\n— Cornelius Kidwell (@ExcuseTheHebrew) January 19, 2026\n\ncurious. https://t.co/dVAFS9ffMb\n\n— Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) January 19, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Fans, others react to Darnell Stapleton move",

O'Neil actually worked for the Jets from 2009-2012 under Rex Ryan, and later worked for the Buffalo Bills in 2013.\n\nO'Neil then coordinated the Cleveland Browns' defense in 2014-15, and then again for the San Francisco 49ers in 2016. The Browns fielded a top-10 scoring defense under O'Neil in 2014, but regressed to 29th in 2015. His 49ers defense in 2016 was the worst in the league, allowing 30 points per contest.\n\nThe Jets have a mixture of intriguing candidates. Ranging from veterans like O'Neil and Martindale to Jim Leonhard and DeMarcus Covington, Glenn has a decision to make.

EnergyNet utilizes 1) an Energy Router that enforces galvanic separation and utilizes software-controlled energy flows over a DC backplane, 2) Energy Local and Wide Area Networks (ELAN/EWAN) based on DC microgrids that interconnect through an open Energy Protocol (EP), and 3) a control plane comprised of the Energy Router Operating System (EROS) and EP Server which is managed at operator scale through an Energy Network Management System (ENMS). We distinguish the architectural contribution (Tier-1 including components, interfaces, and operating model) from expected outcomes contingent on adoption (Tier-2). The latter includes local-first autonomy with global interoperability, near-real-time operation with local buffering, removal of EV-charging bottlenecks, freed grid capacity for data centers and industrial electrification, as well as a trend toward low, predictable, fixed-cost clean energy.

    "description": "A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.  U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\n\nCobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong \"procedural vehicle\" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nLast month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.\n\nA day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.\n\nOn Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.\n\n“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.\n\nDemocracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.\n\n“We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,” she said in a statement.\n\nTwelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.\n\nA law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.\n\n\"Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,\" plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nJustice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.\n\n“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.\n\n“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.\n\n“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",

O'Neil, who also added the defensive assistant title with the Lions in 2025, has been with Detroit each of the past two seasons.\n\nO'Neil, 47, has worked in the Jets organization before, serving as the Jets' defensive quality control coach in 2009 when New York advanced to the first of what would be back-to-back AFC Championship games.\n\nThe Jets boasted the NFL's No. 1 passing defense (153.7 passing yards per game), total defense (252.3 yards per game), and scoring defense (14.8 points per game) during that 2009 campaign.\n\nWe've completed virtual interviews with the following candidates for our defensive coordinator opening.\n\n— New York Jets (@nyjets) January 16, 2026\n\nIn Detroit, O'Neil has overseen one of the league's best safety tandems.

    "description": "Worried about losing unified Republican power in Washington and mystified at his lack of support among the public, President Donald Trump keeps talking about not holding the November midterm elections, when Republicans could lose control of the House, Senate or both.",
    "fullText": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, \n\nWorried about losing unified Republican power in Washington and mystified at his lack of support among the public, President Donald Trump keeps talking about not holding the November midterm elections, when Republicans could lose control of the House, Senate or both.\n\nTrump doesn’t understand why his approval rating is underwater (and it is, on every issue, in a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS and released Friday).\n\n“I wish you could explain to me what the hell’s going on with the mind of the public,” he told House Republicans in a speech earlier this month.\n\nLater, he added: “Now, I won’t say, ‘Cancel the election. They should cancel the election,’ because the fake news will say, ‘He wants the elections canceled. He’s a dictator.’”\n\nBut Trump did talk about canceling the election in an interview with Reuters this week. He said Republicans have been so successful that “when you think of it, we shouldn’t even have an election.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said the president was “joking” and “being facetious” about canceling the election.\n\nIf it’s a joke, it’s material he’s been working on for months. Told during an appearance with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last September that Ukraine won’t hold an election during a period of martial law during its war with Russia, Trump expressed some envy.\n\n“So you say during the war, you can’t have elections,” Trump said. “So let me just say, three and a half years from now – so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections? Oh, that’s good.”\n\nTrump routinely says things that seem like trolls until they don’t. Owning Greenland? Not a joke. However, he seems to have retreated from the oft-repeated idea of an unconstitutional third term.\n\nAnd for the record, unlike Ukraine, the US has held elections in the midst of multiple wars, when the British had invaded in 1812 and when it was at war with itself in 1864. It held elections during world wars when millions of Americans fought overseas in the 20th century as well.\n\nTrump knows that presidents rarely pick up seats in a midterm. His administration has been moving at breakneck speed to change the government because, as his chief of staff famously said, they know that presidents expect to lose power after their first two years. A net loss of just a handful of seats would give control of the House to Democrats, for instance, requiring their buy-in for spending and giving them power to investigate his administration.\n\nThe Constitution requires that a new Congress be sworn in on January 3, 2027. Election Day is set in law, so it is theoretically feasible for Congress to move it, but not to cancel the election. Elections are supposed to be administered by each state, so state governors and legislatures could, in theory, move their own elections to deal with a major disaster, but there’s no precedent for it. To get into the weeds of all of this, read a report from the Congressional Research Service.\n\nTrump has also mused about using emergency powers to meddle with elections. He told the New York Times recently that he regrets not directing National Guards to seize voting machines after the 2020 election.\n\nEven the elections he has won, he has said were rigged. There’s still no evidence of any widespread voter fraud, even after all these years of the Trump era.\n\nElection officials say they are thinking very carefully about all of this. Asked about Trump’s musings at an event sponsored by The Atlantic this week, Arizona’s top election official, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said this:\n\n“The fact that we’re running through these scenarios in the first place should tell you something about the health of our democracy,” Fontes added.\n\nTo that end, he would not elaborate on what scenarios they’re preparing for.\n\n“I don’t want to give the bad guys any ideas,” Fontes said.\n\nWhile Trump might fantasize about canceling the election, the reality is that the election system is already changing in some key ways. Some of them may be enormously consequential.\n\nRepublicans have drawn themselves nine more friendly seats across the country, and Democrats have ended up with six, mostly in California. Republicans see additional opportunity in Florida, while Democrats plan a redistricting ballot initiative in Virginia in April. Read more.\n\nIf the Supreme Court decides to further gut the Voting Rights Act, Republicans could in theory redraw maps in many other states. Read takeaways from October’s oral arguments.\n\nThe long-term result of more and more political gerrymandering without protections for racial minority-focused districts could be the smothering of minority-party delegations in multiple states, making the House map look increasingly more like the presidential map. Far fewer Democratic districts in Texas. Far fewer Republican districts in California — even though there are millions of both Republicans and Democrats in both states.\n\nWhile much of the effort has been stopped, for now, by courts, Trump’s goal is to exert more executive control over elections that are supposed to be governed by Congress and states.\n\nA federal court on Thursday sided with California against the administration’s demand that the state turn over information on its 23 million voters.\n\nThe Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether mail-in ballots that are postmarked by, but arrive after Election Day can still be counted. The decision could have serious consequences for the country’s large scale adoption of mail-in voting in recent years. Trump is a loud skeptic of the practice even though he has personally voted by mail. His executive order would also scramble how states use voting machines, another response to phantom voter fraud that could actually drastically slow down the counting of ballots.\n\nEarly on, his administration scaled back the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, which is meant to helps states guard their election systems from attack. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem canceled funding for an information sharing network that helped states detect and ward off coordinated hacking attacks, as CNN reported last year.\n\nHis Justice Department has rewired the agency’s Civil Rights Division away from its original core mission of civil rights abuses, including those related to elections. One current focus of the division is to help states “clean” voter rolls, although a judge recently ruled that effort was a misapplication of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nTrump’s administration has already tried to change how people vote through executive action, and who they vote for through changing maps.\n\nThere’s a lot of time for more gaming the system between now and November, and Trump clearly already has the midterms on the brain.",

In addition, the team placed forward Justin Sourdif on injured reserve (IR).\n\nMiroshnichenko, 21, previously made his season debut for the Capitals on Dec. 20, and also played the next day on Dec. 21. In Hershey this season, the Russian forward has recorded 16 points (6 goals, 10 assists).\n\nMiroshnichenko had a stellar 2024-25 campaign with the Bears, setting career highs in goals (23), assists (19), and points (42). The forward’s 23 goals led Hershey, while his 42 points ranked third on the team.\n\nThe Capitals selected Miroshnichenko in the first round (20th overall) of he 2022 NHL Draft. He has recorded 10 points (3 goals, 7 assists) in 41 career NHL games. Additionally, Miroshnichenko has 83 points (38 goals, 45 assists) in 120 career AHL games.\n\nMeanwhile, Sourdif, 23, has been a quality addition to the Capitals this season. The rookie has recorded 19 points (9 goals, 10 assists) in 45 games.\n\nSourdif was selected in the third round (87th overall) by the Florida Panthers in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft. Last summer, he was traded to the Capitals and signed a two-year, $1.65 million contract extension the next day.\n\nThe Capitals have struggled since the team’s last winning streak ended in early December, going 7-9-4 across 20 games. One of the main factors of the slump has been injuries.\n\nThe Capitals already lost Pierre-Luc Dubois in late October for a majority of the season. During the recent slump, the team has been without various players in the lineup at points, due to injuries/illnesses.

    "description": "Semafor CEO Justin Smith explains how his company bucked industry trends by focusing on Washington, DC, and the \"global leadership class.\"",
    "fullText": "The news business is gloomy these days, and lots of companies are bracing for more grim news: Changes in the distribution landscape are making it harder to get the news you produce in front of people who want to consume it, which means you have less revenue to make more compelling news. Which can lead to a grim cycle.\n\nBut last week, Semafor, which pitches itself as a news outlet for the global leadership class, said it was bucking the trend: The startup, launched by former BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith and former Bloomberg executive Justin Smith in 2022, had turned a profit in 2025.\n\nThe speed at which Semafor has made this work is surprising. The business plan is less so: Semafor, like other recent successful news startups, has built itself by aiming squarely at Washington, DC, and positioning itself as a way for advertisers to reach powerful CEOs and government officials who do business there.\n\nI talked to Semafor CEO Justin Smith (he's not related to Ben Smith) about why the Washington market is lucrative and how his company thinks it can make more money in the future. You can listen to our entire conversation on my Channels podcast; what follows are edited excerpts from our chat.\n\nPeter Kafka: You folks just announced that you were profitable last year, your third year in operation. You also announced that you had raised another $30 million, and made a profit of $2 million on $40 million in revenue. If you're making money, why did you raise more money?\n\nJustin Smith: If you've been in the media business for 30 years, you know the media business is pretty unpredictable. Just because you've had a good couple of years, and you've developed what we think is a really interesting model — if there's a chance to raise money, with good long-term investors, to accelerate the things that are working, it's a good idea.\n\nWe feel like it's taken three years, but we've got the foundation of what we believe is an interesting innovation in the media space. It's a new formula that is working, and we feel like we can extend it across the world and across new markets, and that's what we're going to use the new capital for.\n\nSemafor has leaned heavily into events since you launched, and you say 50% of your revenue comes from events. But that's a very hard business to scale. How do you think you'll grow?\n\nWe did almost a hundred events this year. But a lot of the energy and focus of our event strategy is around some of the bigger convenings that we do. As we go forward, the idea is not necessarily to go from a hundred to 200 to 300 events.\n\nThe strategy is much more likely to be to build a series of tentpoles that themselves become larger, more significant, more valuable commercially, more influential editorially. That's how you scale it.\n\nI've seen people talking about your ambition to take on Davos, the annual global business/policy conference happening this month. Is that a real plan?\n\nWhen we started Semafor, in the original business plan deck, we saw an opportunity to build a leading CEO convening in the United States. We looked at the US market, and we thought, \"It's interesting. This is the largest economy in the world, and there is not a dominant leading CEO convening platform.\"\n\nWe thought that was an interesting fact, which presented an opportunity. So from the very beginning, we envisioned building this from scratch. And we identified Washington, DC, as the best location to do this, which was also a little bit of an unusual choice.\n\nDC's historically not been a place where CEOs travel. It's not been historically a center of business, but that of course has been changing across the last five to seven years: The role of geopolitics in the boardroom, the rise of regulation — all these different trends have converged and now CEOs from both the United States and across the world find themselves in Washington three, four, five, 10 times a year. And we were fortunate because we made that bet.\n\nPeter: You've been describing a business that's very DC-based. You are based in DC. It's really striking that some of the most successful media startups of the last few years — you guys, Axios, Punchbowl, Puck, to some extent — are all making money or trying to make money in Washington, by matching advertisers with powerful people. How much bigger can that market get?\n\nIt's effectively a B2B marketplace. What's sometimes confusing to people is that many of these news properties, including Semafor, are consumer-facing now — consumer web pages and consumer-focused newsletters. But since the audience that they're appealing to is this segment of this leadership audience, it allows for a much more targeted type of business monetization.\n\nIn this case, it's the corporate affairs market, which is largely corporate reputation. There's also a bit of advocacy advertising.\n\nFacebook saying, \"We believe healthy regulation is a great idea.\"\n\nExactly. This market has existed for a long time, and there was a whole predecessor group of brands before Politico and Axios. You may remember Roll Call, or the Hill, or National Journal. Those were some of the most successful and profitable and commercially viable media businesses around.\n\nObviously, these new digital disruptors came along and stole the market from those legacy players. But I think what also happened is that the market grew really, really dramatically because the intersection of government and business has become more pronounced and more intense.\n\nI think the stakes have gotten higher and higher and higher for companies operating in the US, and their needs to communicate their corporate brand positions have gotten more urgent.\n\nI had heard early on that you guys were going to make your version of the networks' Sunday shows, which is fueled by that same economy.\n\nThose were some of the most profitable TV shows on television back in the day. They probably still are today.\n\nYou guys have not launched your version of a Sunday show. Do you think that's something you'll try?\n\nWe actually started with a video investment. We thought, \"Let's see if we can produce this opinion leader video.\" We tried, and were unable to really figure it out, and we ended up killing it within six months or so.\n\nBecause as a startup, I think that's probably one of the better decisions we made — just to focus on the stuff that's working, and stop doing the stuff that's not working.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

    "title": "Gonzaga at Washington State Preview With Cougars Junior Forward Rihards Vavers",
    "description": "Hear from Washington State Cougars junior forward Rihards Vavers before the Battle in the Palouse.",
    "fullText": "The Washington State Cougars (8-10, 3-2 WCC) had to deal with a plentiful amount of turnover during the offseason, losing the likes of senior guard Nate Calmese (Wake Forest Demon Deacons), redshirt junior forward LeJuan Watts (Texas Tech Red Raiders). and sophomore guard Isiah Watts (Maryland Terrapins). Even with forward Cedric Coward, who now plays for the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nThis season’s group has had its downs. That included a rough experience at the Maui Invitational (only beat the host Chaminade Silverswords), followed by three straight losses at the Bradley Braves, vs. the Nevada Wolfpack, and the USC Trojans.\n\nHeading over to West Coast Conference play, the Cougars have a rough stretch of back-to-back-to-back competition. They lost at home to the Saint Mary’s Gaels (88-82) this past Saturday, Jan. 10, have the upcoming bout with the No. 9 Gonzaga Bulldogs (17-1, 5-0 WCC), and then head down to the Bay Area to take on the San Francisco Dons on Saturday, Jan. 18.\n\nWashington State junior forward Rihards Vavers knows a thing or two about a crazy travel schedule, as he hails from Adazi, Latvia. The Slipper Still Fits chatted with him before the matchup with the Zags and asked him who some of his favorite Latvian basketball inspirations.\n\n“The obvious one would be Kristaps Porzingis. I grew up watching him. The Bertans brothers. Arthur Jagas, he’s a point guard playing in the EuroLeague. There’s a lot of good people now coming out of Latvia. It’s been cool to see everybody grow and expand their game.”\n\nStarting out his collegiate career with the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference’s Quinnipiac Bobcats in Hamden, Connecticut, Vavers has always been a top-shelf shooter, shooting 39.5 percent from beyond the arc through his 57 career games played.\n\nLast season with the Cougars, Vavers didn’t get to show all that he’s capable of, as he was dealing with injuries. He only played 17 games in 2024-25 as he had suffered broken bones in both hands.\n\nIn 2025-26, the 6-7, 210-pound product is scoring 9.4 points per game on a shooting split of 42.5 field goal percentage/37.8 three-point percentage/82.4 free throw percentage to go along with 3.2 rebounds per game. Vavers has started five of the 17 games that he’s played this season.\n\nSince coming to Pullman, coach David Riley’s coaching style has helped open up Vavers’ game.\n\n“He just see the confidence in me. He just sees how great of a shooter I am and my teammates do as well. They find me, they believe in me. Once I got my team behind my back, I just come out every night and attack the basket, read the game. Riley’s confidence and all the coaching staff’s confidence in me has really been helping me.”\n\nOne teammate that Vavers has all the confidence in the world is true freshman Ace Glass. The skilled guard has made an immediate impact in Washington State’s backcourt, averaging a team-leading 15.9 points on a shooting split of 47.5 field goal percentage/35.6 three-point percentage/87.5 free throw percentage.\n\n“It’s crazy that he’s a freshman. He’s learning every day. He still asks a lot of questions. Even though he’s one of our best players, he’s still curious about every single thing going on the court. He’s just trying to get that experience… He sees the game differently. He’s a scorer. He’s learning how to play defense… It’s just been amazing to see him grow ever since we got here, since the summer and up until now… I’m so happy for him. And he has so much potential.”\n\nThe first meeting between the Zags and the Cougars dates all the way back to 1907. Washington State leads the all-time series over Gonzaga, 98-54. Although the Zags have won the last seven meetings.\n\nVavers is aware of how much this Eastern Washington rivalry being back means to the state, and as the two programs transition into the revamped Pac-12 Conference.\n\n“It’s great playing guys like from Gonzaga and just getting after it. We get like two – maybe three opportunities, including the tournament, to play against them. So going up against the best of the best to challenge you and just to see what you’ve been working on all year. It’s just a great matchup to play against a top ten team. I feel like we’ve been preparing and growing up ever since the season started.”\n\nThe Beasley Coliseum in the Palouse fits over 12,000 fans. The arena will bring together some of the finest college basketball fans from all over the surrounding area, and Vavers is expecting a deafening environment.\n\n“Students are finally back on campus. Last year was crazy. Hope this year is going to be amazing too. It’s going to be a good game and can’t wait to see everybody out there.”\n\nThe matchup between the two programs tips off on Thursday, Jan. 15, at 7:00 p.m. PT on the CBS Sports Network.\n\nGet off to an early start, close even stronger\n\nThis has been a continuous issue for Gonzaga when it comes to high energy from the get-go, recently against the Seattle U RedHawks and Santa Clara Broncos at the McCarthey Athletic Center. The same goes for giving up a large lead and slacking off in the second half at the Jenny Craig Pavilion against the San Diego Toreros.\n\nPlay competitive basketball for a full 40 minutes.\n\nDefend the ball screen, jump into passing lanes\n\nAmongst the rest of the West Coast Conference programs, the Cougars struggle with taking care of and sharing the ball. Washington State ranks No. 11 with 13.5 turnovers per game and last at No. 12 with 12.4 assists per game.\n\nThe struggles at the charity stripe, as of late, continue for coach Mark Few’s unit.

    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers have precious few assistant coaches on their staff with lengthy pedigrees in the NFL, and there is a chance they could lose one of those few who do have track records in the league to another job this offseason.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Dallas Cowboys submitted a request to the Packers to interview defensive line coach Demarcus Covington for their vacant defensive coordinator position, according to Josina Anderson. The Dallas job came open shortly after the end of the regular season when the Cowboys fired Matt Eberflus (yes, the former Chicago Bears’ head coach) from the job.\n\nCovington does have past experience as a DC, serving in that capacity for the New England Patriots during the 2024 season. That tenure ended when head coach Jerod Mayo was fired, and it immediately preceded his arrival in Green Bay last offseason.\n\nBecause of that experience, Covington was likely to be a candidate for the DC job in Green Bay if Jeff Hafley were to leave for a head coaching job elsewhere. That possibility may still be on the table, but the Cowboys appear to be getting out ahead of a potential Hafley move.",

    "description": "The Tennessee Titans interviewed former Cincinnati Bengals and current Indianapolis Colts DC Lou Anarumo for their open head coach position.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans conducted an interview with Lou Anarumo for the team’s head coaching vacancy. Here's everything you need to know about the Titans' coaching candidate.\n\nAnarumo, 59, is the defensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts. He worked as Cincinnati’s defensive coordinator from 2019-24, guiding the Bengals to one Super Bowl appearance. Before his time in Cincinnati, he also worked as a defensive backs coach in Miami and for the New York Giants.\n\nUnder Anarumo’s leadership, the Colts ranked 21st in scoring defense, 23rd in total defense and 17th in yards allowed per play in 2025. In Anarumo’s seven full seasons as a defensive coordinator, his units only finished in the top half of the NFL in scoring defense or total defense one time, when the 2022 Bengals ranked fifth in scoring.\n\nThat said, Anarumo’s individual gameplans, especially in the postseason, have drawn him some attention. In seven playoff games with Cincinnati, Anarumo’s defenses allowed an average of just 19 points per game, including wins over Josh Allen’s Buffalo Bills, Lamar Jackson’s Baltimore Ravens and Patrick Mahomes’ Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAnarumo rose the coaching ranks initially by coaching defensive backs in colleges. He worked everywhere from Harvard to Marshall to Purdue.\n\nOne sticking point for Titans fans regarding Anarumo’s hire might be his connection to Cincinnati. Namely, he worked on the same Bengals staffs under Zac Taylor that former Titans coach Brian Callahan worked on, and hiring from the same program after firing Callahan so early in his tenure would be a strange decision.\n\nThe Titans fired Callahan in October after a 1-5 start to the 2025 season that followed a 3-14 debut year in 2024. Under interim coach Mike McCoy, the Titans finished the 2025 season with another 3-14 record and earned the No. 4 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Titans have announced completed head coach interviews with the following candidates:\n\nKevin Stefanski, former Browns HC\n\nJason Garrett, former Cowboys HC\n\nThe Titans have also scheduled interviews with or requested interviews from the following candidates: Former Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, former Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris, former Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley and San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh.\n\nNick Suss is the Titans beat writer for The Tennessean.

    "fullText": "Human remains found in Washington have been identified as those of Clarence Edwin “Ed” Asher, a former Oregon mayor who vanished in 2006.\n\nAsher, the former mayor of Fossil, Oregon, was presumed by authorities to have drowned during a crabbing trip in September 2006, according to Oregon outlet KATU. He was 72 years old when he was declared dead.\n\nRemains were found on a beach along the Washington coast shortly after Asher disappeared, but were named under “John Doe” after authorities were unable to identify them.\n\nLast year, DNA was sent to Othram, a lab in Texas that specializes in cold cases, where the remains were finally identified.\n\nThe Coast Guard launched a search and rescue operation in 2006 following Asher’s disappearance at Tillamook Bay, on the coast of Oregon, but the search was suspended after just one day. At the time, Coast Guard members found Asher’s boat idling in the water with live crab onboard.\n\nAsher’s wife, who died in 2018 at the age of 85, had told authorities her husband could not swim.\n\nThe former mayor worked as a lineman technician for the Fossil Telephone Company for nearly 50 years and volunteered as a fireman and ambulance driver, according to his obituary. He also opened a variety store at one point. At the time of his death, Asher had 21 grandchildren.\n\nThe post Human Remains Found on Beach Identified as Former Mayor Who Vanished 20 Years Ago first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "The Montreal Canadiens played a great game in Washington for 40 minutes, and then the wheels fell off the wagon. While Samuel Montembeault put up a great fight, he just couldn't do it all on his own, and Montreal lost 3-2 in overtime.",
    "fullText": "After claiming a 6-3 win against the Vancouver Canucks on Monday night, the Montreal Canadiens were taking on the Washington Capitals on Tuesday night. Alexander Ovechkin and the Caps have had the Habs’ number of late, but without Tom Wilson, Jacob Chychrun, Justin Sourdif and Pierre-Luc Dubois, the locals came out flat, so to speak.\n\nOf course, the Caps still had Alexander Ovechkin, but the Great Eight is not as much of a threat without his proper supporting cast. Even on the power play, the sniper still just stands there waiting for the perfect feed, even though it’s clearly not coming. At times, the fans even booed their once-devastating man advantage. Still, thanks to a fantastic third frame, the Capitals came back from 0-2 to win 3-2 in overtime.\n\nEx-Canadiens First-Rounder Lands Extension With New Team\nCanadiens: Hutson Was “Grounded”\nCanadiens: It Wasn’t Perfect, But It Was Enough\n\nBrendan Gallagher has made the headlines recently, but not necessarily for the right reasons, as fans and media alike have started questioning whether he’ll remain in the lineup when the injured Habs are ready to return. In this game, however, he scored an important goal, not only because it gave the Canadiens a 2-0 lead, but because it was the 243rd of his career, which means he’s now tied with Mats Naslund for the 14th most goals scored while playing for the storied franchise.\n\nChose qu'on aime réentendre: «De Danault à Gallagher»\n\nSomething we'd like to hear again: \"From Danault to Gallagher\"#GoHabsGo pic.twitter.com/ZOjwjMUhOy\n\n— Canadiens Montréal (@CanadiensMTL) January 14, 2026\n\nOf course, Gallagher needed 881 matches to reach the milestone while Nastlund only needed 617 games, but still, for a fifth-round pick to have that kind of career with the same franchise is quite a feat. Gallagher has earned everything he has done in his career, nothing was ever given to him.\n\nIf there remained any doubts about whether Samuel Montembeault was fully back, they should have been eclipsed by his performance tonight. Flawless through 40 minutes after having made 17 saves, the Canadiens’ goaltender was put through a real test in the third as we faced 16 shots. While he did allow two goals, they were both nice deflected shots from Ethan Frank, and neither can be held against the Habs’ goaltender.\n\nMontyyyyy pic.twitter.com/nyumH0lUZB\n\n— Canadiens Montréal (@CanadiensMTL) January 14, 2026\n\nMontembeault's puck tracking and rebound control were on point, and he played a calm, collected game despite mounting pressure, especially late in the game. Without his heroics, the Caps wouldn’t have needed the overtime period to seal the deal. Washington added another 10 shots in the extra frame, and the goaltender stood tall as captain Nick Suzuki was stuck in the box, but with 39 seconds left, Connor McMichael called game.\n\nSince the game was the second part of a back-to-back, the Canadiens elected to give Kaiden Guhle a night off and to bring Jayden Struble back into the lineup. While the decision makes sense from a workload management standpoint for Guhle, it meant that Noah Dobson spent 28:37 on the ice and Mike Matheson 27:54. Meanwhile, Arber Xhekaj only saw 7:03 of action, the fact that he was in the penalty box for so long after getting 17 penalty minutes didn’t help his cause much, and Jayden Struble only played 9:43 after he looked a bit worse for wear following a hit.\n\nIn his first game in 13 days, Josh Anderson did well, scoring the Canadiens’ first goal as they were on the penalty kill.\n\nUn homme en moins, un cheval en plus 🐎\n\nGood to have you back, Andy!#GoHabsGo pic.twitter.com/DycYJydkiQ\n\n— Canadiens Montréal (@CanadiensMTL) January 14, 2026\n\nWhile the Canadiens leave Washington with a point, they could definitely have used two, and sooner rather than later, they may start regretting not having many regulation wins, since it's the first tiebreaker if points are tied.\n\nFollow Karine on X @KarineHains Bluesky @karinehains.bsky.social and Threads @karinehains.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Canadiens' page for all the news and happenings around the Canadiens.\n\nJoin the discussion by signing up to the Canadiens' roundtable on The Hockey News.\n\ncom/free.
