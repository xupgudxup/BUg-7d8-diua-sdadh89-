    "fullText": "Current Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz was in the running to be the next head coach for the Cleveland Browns. He was one of the three finalists for the job, but he was passed over for Todd Monken. Once it was announced that Schwartz wasn’t going to be the head man in charge, Schwartz seemed upset about missing out on another head coaching opportunity (this was the second time he was passed up on another head coaching spot; he was a finalist for the Browns job in 2020).\n\nPeople will blame the Browns for doing this to Schwartz, but in reality, the person who is not free of blame is Schwartz. The team is trying to keep Schwartz, but the relationship is damaged.\n\nThe relationship between the #Browns and DC Jim Schwartz will “need significant repairing” after he was passed over for the HC job, sources tell me. Schwartz is currently under contract but was anticipating getting the HC job.\n\nHe didn’t… and now there’s work to do. https://t.co/JQ9PncR6CP pic.twitter.com/PTezSh2qI7\n\n— Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) January 28, 2026\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles were considering Schwartz if Vic Fangio were to retire, which is still possible:\n\nSources: Eagles considered Jim Schwartz and Jonathan Gannon for defensive coordinator job after Vic Fangio retirement scare https://t.co/cCl7ZbcmfI\n\n— Jimmy Kempski (@JimmyKempski) February 1, 2026\n\nAs mentioned, the relationship needs to be repaired, but Schwartz is under contract for another year. If the Browns want to bring Schwartz back, it should be met with two options: come back and be a positive force this time, or early retirement.\n\nBoth parties aren’t free of blame for why this situation is the way it is, but Schwartz doesn’t deserve any sympathy. Schwartz acting the way he did when he was passed up on a job was considered unprofessional. Schwartz is likely not going to get another head coaching job, and it’s hard to see him finding another defensive coordinator job this year based on recent events.\n\nIs Schwartz a good defensive coordinator? Yes, but there is a large portion of Browns fans who overrate Schwartz. The Browns have been an elite defense under Schwartz, but in terms of scheme, it’s basic and the talent the team possesses defensively masks the flaws of the scheme. Not much complexity or exoticness, the scheme hasn’t evolved, and that falls on coaching. Most defensive coordinators would love to coach this unit if the job were to be available. Schwartz has no leverage in this situation.\n\nIt’s clear the team wants Schwartz backs and both sides need to come together to mend this relationship, but the Browns should draw a line in the sand to get their coaching staff in order as soon as possible.",

    "description": "The race is set for August, leaving a tight timeline for the ambitious program to come together.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration announced on Friday that the president has signed an executive order directing the creation of an IndyCar race on Washington D.C.'s Capitol Mall. The race would be held on August 23 as part of a larger celebration of the 250th anniversary of American independence.\n\nAccording to an announcement shared by IndyCar, the executive order directs the \"White House Task Force on Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday\" to designate a route for the race. The full order, titled \"Celebrating American Greatness with American Motor Racing,\" was published on the White House website on Friday.\n\nAs an executive order is not itself law, the declaration is not the same as a completed plan to host an IndyCar race around the nation's capital. A tight seven-month timeline will make actually putting the event together a challenge, but a release shared by IndyCar quotes both D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, among other enthusiastic stakeholders working to make the event happen. That suggests some level of cooperation between the city and multiple departments of the presidential administration, greatly increasing the odds that the race comes together before the scheduled Summer date.\n\nNeither IndyCar nor the administration have shared a track layout for the potential race. All mentions of the race note it only as an event celebrating the 250th anniversary of independence, suggesting that this is meant to be a one-time event. That could make a high-profile route through the National Mall more plausible, although construction along a track in that area would still mean major interruptions at some of the country's most-visited tourist sites throughout Spring and Summer.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "fullText": "Radio: Huskies Gameday App, Sports Radio KJR\n\nBetting Line: Washington Huskies +12.5\n\nPoints For per Game: 85.5 (25th)\n\nPoints Against per Game: 68.3 (41st)\n\nAdjusted Offensive Efficiency: 130.4 (1st)\n\nAdjusted Defensive Efficiency: 99.1 (29th)\n\nG- Keaton Wagler, Fr. 6’6, 185: 17.5 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 4.0 apg, 47.7% FG, 43.5% 3pt, 82.6% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +8.6 BPR (22nd nationally)\n\nWagler is one of the all-time outliers in modern college basketball. He was the #150 ranked freshman in the class of 2025 and yet has clearly been a top-25 player in the entire country among all classes as demonstrated by his 46-point demolition of Purdue last weekend. Wagler is a 6’6 3-star freshman point guard who is 12th nationally in offensive efficiency. He hardly ever turns the ball over, is a lights out 3-point shooter, draws a ton of fouls, and can make every pass. Just an amazing season so far.\n\nG- Jake Davis, Jr. 6’6, 215: 4.8 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 0.7 apg, 44.0% FG, 41.5% 3pt, 75.0% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +3.9 BPR (406th nationally)\n\nDavis has been thrust into the starting lineup with the recent injury to starting guard Kylan Boswell. But that’s not necessarily that bad of a thing because Davis is 2nd(!) nationally in offensive efficiency. He absolutely never turns the ball over with just 2 giveaways all season and is the epitome of a 3-point sniper. Over 80% of his attempts this season have been from behind the arc and is a career 40% shooter to justify it. Davis has good size at 6’6 but adds almost nothing from a defense/rebounding standpoint so is exclusively a 5th option floor spacer. Still nice to have.\n\nF- Andrej Stojakovic, Jr. 6’7, 215: 13.9 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 1.1 apg, 50.0% FG, 26.3% 3pt, 81.8% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +4.5 BPR (279th nationally)\n\nStojakovic was the final piece of the puzzle for Illinois in the transfer portal after transferring from Stanford to Cal to now the Illini. The 3-point shot has just never really developed and is at a career low right now but it’s okay because Stojakovic has been great at the rim and in the midrange. The rebounding and steal numbers are lower than you’d like but he’s still clearly an additive player and has the length to bother opponents on the other end even if he isn’t the best defender in the world.\n\nF- David Mirkovic, Fr, 6’9, 250: 12.2 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 2.6 apg, 47.4% FG, 37.5% 3pt, 80.6% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +7.0 BPR (72nd nationally)\n\nMirkovic was an offseason Euro import from Montenegro and has been a really nice addition for Illinois. His assist rate is really high for your average power forward and he’s both a very good rebounder and three-point shooter. His block rate is about what you’d expect for your average 6’4 shooting guard so he offers no rim protection but is big enough to still both Hannes Steinbach in that matchup.\n\nC- Tomislav Ivisic, Jr. 7’1, 255: 10.2 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 0.6 bpg, 49.2% FG, 36.8% 3pt, 70.4% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +7.0 BPR (70th nationally)\n\nThe key to the Illinois offense is the Croatian brother duo of Tomislav and Zvonimir Ivisic who combine to play nearly 100% of the center minutes for Illinois. Tomislav starts has been better on the offensive end while Zvonimir is 2nd in the country in block rate as the rim protector. Both are shooting at least 67% on 2-pointers and almost exactly 36% on 3-pointers which makes them wildly efficient.\n\nIt’s safe to say that the all-Balkan roster makeover has worked out pretty well for Illinois and head coach Brad Underwood. There were thoughts in the offseason that Illinois would end up with 5 of their top 6 players who have a last name ending in “ic”: Mihailo Petrovic, Andrej Stojakovic, David Mirkovic, Tomislav Ivisic, and Zvonimir Ivisic. The only player not of that background was projected to be Kylan Boswell (Stojakovic was born in the US but is the son of former Serbian NBA star Peja Stojakovic so you can’t so the only American).\n\nAlmost every aspect of that remodel has worked except for Petrovic. He hasn’t been close to a starting caliber point guard and has fallen out of the rotation thanks to a ton of turnovers and poor shooting. That might have doomed many teams to underachieve. Except enter Keaton Wagler.\n\nNo one could’ve predicted that a three-star freshman would not only start for Illinois at point guard but legitimately enter the All-American conversation and become a top-ten NBA draft pick. That just doesn’t happen. Wagler is the engine behind an offense that is not just #1 in the country per KenPom but the best in KenPom’s database which goes back to 1997. That will likely drop off a bit at some point but the Illini are an absolute machine.\n\nIt looked like Illinois might only be so-so after they dropped to 8-3 following a home loss to Nebraska. That loss obviously looks better in hindsight and Illinois has won 9 straight since then. They’re now 3-3 against top-20 KenPom teams and 14-0 against everyone else. Not exactly encouraging for Washington.\n\nAs mentioned above, the success revolves around the Illinois offense. They take over half of their shots from beyond the 3-point arc and play five legitimate shooting threats at almost all times. Illinois will absolutely bomb it from deep and shoot 36% as a team from that range. They’ve made at least 10 three-point shots in 11 of their last 12 games. That’s compared to Washington who have hit that mark just 3 times all season (although they notably did it in their last game against Oregon). The math says it’s really hard to out-shoot them.\n\nEven when Illinois does miss a shot, they get it back almost half the time. Illinois is 4th nationally in offensive rebounding rate thanks to being the tallest team in the country with a rotation made entirely of players 6’6 or taller that aggressively crash the glass. That usually leads to kick outs and more three-point attempts rather than easy putbacks but they do shoot 58.4% (25th nationally) on two-point shots when they do decide to shoot it from close range. Oh, and if you foul them then they make nearly 80% of their free throws which ranks 4th nationally.\n\nSo they take and make a lot of three-pointers. And when they miss they get it back at an elite rate. And when they take close shots or get fouled they make them at an elite rate. Maybe we can force turnovers against them? Nope. They also rank 34th in turnover percentage. The math says Illinois has a sizable advantage from every area on offense and that’s why they have the best offense in the country.\n\nThere are some weaknesses to exploit on defense relatively but not that many. Illinois being the tallest team in the country does mean that it’s really hard to be outright bad on defense. They can at least contest shots with their length at every position even if they don’t have the best athletes. The rebounding and blocked shot numbers are very good because of that.\n\nWhere Illinois has their biggest issue is their depth. With Boswell’s injury and Petrovic not living up to expectations it means this is basically a 7-man roster right now. The Ivisic brothers combine to take up essentially all 40 minutes at center and then only 6’9 Ben Humrichous is truly available to soak up minutes at the 3/4 with the guards otherwise playing just about the whole game. So that means just get Illinois in foul trouble, right?\n\nEasier said then done. Illinois knows they’ve got issues with depth and so they just don’t foul. They rank 1st in the country in opponent free throw rate. That’s not a great sign for Washington. The Huskies are 2-7 this year when they have a free throw rate on offense below 30%. Illinois gives up 19% on average. Washington absolutely needs a friendly whistle to have any shot at pulling an upset but it doesn’t seem likely.\n\nThe flip side of Illinois’ aversion to fouling is that they also don’t force turnovers. They’re dead last in opponent turnover rate and 2nd to last in steal rate on defense. If Washington is going to win this game then they need that trend to continue with 5 or fewer turnovers. The Huskies have to find ways to make up possessions knowing what a juggernaut Illinois is on offense and one of the only clear ways to do that is to keep from turning it over when UW has the ball. And oh yeah, they’re going to have shoot like they did against Oregon making close to 50% of their three-pointers.\n\nEarlier this week I looked into how brutal Washington’s schedule has been recently. The 7-game stretch culminating in this game is the 4th toughest for any team this season and they recently wrapped a 5-game stretch that was the toughest of any team in the entire country. Illinois is scorching hot. Washington got a feel good win this weekend to hopefully build some momentum but no one has gotten within 5 points of Illinois since December 13th. Things are set to turn around soon with the schedule lightening up but the best UW can hope for in this one is a late surge helping them cover the spread like they’ve done a few times recently. I’m not counting on it though\n\nWashington Huskies– 68, Illinois Fighting Illini- 85\n\nSeason picks: 14-6 straight up, 10-10 against the spread",

    "fullText": "Prediction markets are getting a bad rap amid concerns about insider trading. Now, some of them are fighting back.\n\nThe Coalition for Prediction Markets, which includes companies like Kalshi, Coinbase, and Robinhood, took out a full-page ad in the Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\nThe ad highlights the companies' support for a ban on insider trading on prediction market platforms and calls on Congress to work with them to \"keep prediction markets safe and transparent.\"\n\n\"CFTC regulated prediction markets (already) ban insider trading,\" the ad reads.\n\nA spokesperson for the coalition told Business Insider the ad is the \"opening salvo\" in a coming PR blitz pushing for the codification of federal regulation for prediction markets — a key goal for the companies, as regulators in some states seek to clamp down on the burgeoning industry.\n\n\"The coalition plans to spend seven figures in the coming months in coordination with its government relations outreach,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe PR campaign comes after a trader on Polymarket made more than $400,000 off of a well-timed bet on former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's political future just hours before his capture by US forces.\n\nThat's led to greater scrutiny of prediction markets broadly, along with a new proposed bill to formally ban insider trading by government officials who might have access to sensitive information.\n\nIn the wake of that trade, Kalshi has sought to distinguish itself from Polymarket, which was banned from serving US users from 2022 to 2025 and only recently gained approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nPolymarket is not a member of the Coalition for Prediction Markets, and the group's spokesperson said that the ad is meant to draw \"a clear contrast with offshore platforms where concerning scandals such as the Maduro trade have occurred.\" A Polymarket spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company, which has signed partnerships with the Wall Street Journal and the Golden Globes, hasn't made any public statements about the Maduro trade controversy. Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan has previously suggested that insider trading can help disseminate information more broadly.",

On the Bills' first second-half possession, linebacker Kurt Gouveia intercepted a Jim Kelly pass, nearly returning it for a touchdown. Gerald Riggs hammered the ball into the end zone, and it was 24-0 Redskins.\n\nREDEMPTION!\nJanuary 26, 1992\n\nFour years after \"The Fumble\" in the AFC Championship with the #Browns in Denver, running back Earnest Byner scores the first touchdown of Super Bowl XXVI en route to the Redskins' third Super Bowl title.#HTTR #RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/FWP0mbSpwV\n\n— Kevin Gallagher (@KevG163) January 26, 2026\n\nEarly in the final quarter, Mark Rypien, Earnest Byner, the Hogs, and the Posse (Art Monk, Gary Clark, Ricky Sanders), Charles Mann, Wilber Marshall, Darrell Green, and the rest of the Redskins were destroying the AFC Champion Bills 37-10. The game's final several minutes were anticlimactic, much less intense, with cameras showing Redskins on the sidelines laughing and enjoying themselves on their way to another Super Bowl championship, as the Bills scored two late scores for a 37-24 final.\n\nIt was Joe Jackson Gibbs' fourth Super Bowl with Washington and the third he had won. He had amazingly won those three Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks who were not Hall of Fame quarterbacks (Joe Theismann, Doug Williams, Mark Rypien). He also won with three different starting running backs (John Riggins, Timmy Smith, Earnest Byner). OT Joe Jacoby, C Jeff Bostic, WR Art Monk, TE Don Warren, G Russ Grimm and LB Monte Coleman played on all four of those Gibbs teams.\n\nSince that time Washington head coaches have been Richie Petitbon, Norv Turner, Terry Robiskie, Marty Schottenheimer, Steve Spurrier, Joe Gibbs again (2004-2007), Jim Zorn, Mike Shanahan, Jay Gruden, Bill Callahan, Ron Rivera, and Dan Quinn.\n\nYes, a lot has changed for Washington in the last 34 years, sadly, even the name.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: 34 years ago was franchise's last Super Bowl",

    "fullText": "Venezuela’s acting president Delcy Rodríguez said Sunday she has had “enough” of Washington’s orders, as she works to unite the country after the US capture of its former leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nRodríguez has been walking a tight-rope since being backed by the US to lead the country in the interim; balancing keeping Maduro loyalists on board at home while trying to ensure the White House is happy.\n\nNow, almost a month into her new role, Rodríguez has pushed back on the US, amid ongoing pressure including a series of demands for Venezuela to resume oil production.\n\n“Enough already of Washington’s orders over politicians in Venezuela,” she told a group of oil workers in Puerto La Cruz city, at an event broadcast by state-run channel Venezolana de Televisión.\n\n“Let Venezuelan politics resolve our differences and our internal conflicts. This Republic has paid a very high price for having to confront the consequences of fascism and extremism in our country.”\n\nThe White House has maintained steady pressure on Venezuela since Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were seized in a raid in early January and taken to the US, where the former leader is facing charges.\n\nRodríguez, Maduro’s former deputy, has insisted in recent weeks that the US does not govern Venezuela but, equally, has not sought confrontation with Washington.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had claimed the US was “going to run” Venezuela in the immediate aftermath of Maduro’s capture, but he later backed Rodríguez as the country’s interim leader.\n\nCNN has contacted the White House for comment on Rodríguez’s latest statement.\n\nFor the past 25 years, oil-rich socialist Venezuela has been in constant confrontation with the US. But after deposing Maduro, Washington is now seeking to secure a stable source of authority in Caracas.\n\nInternally, the country remains divided among Maduro loyalists, left-wing opposition and “Chavistas No-Maduristas” – supporters of the late Hugo Chávez who reject Maduro, accusing him of betraying 21st-century socialist ideals.\n\nDays after the US strikes on Caracas in early January, the Trump administration outlined a number of demands that Venezuela must agree to, including cutting ties with China, Iran, Russia and Cuba, and agreeing to partner exclusively with the US on oil production, two senior White House officials told CNN at the time.\n\nRodríguez was also expected to prioritize the Trump administration and US oil companies for future oil sales.\n\nVenezuela’s main economic driver is oil. The country has the world’s largest reserves of extra-heavy crude, a variety that requires a more complex and expensive refining process but which is also compatible with US refineries.\n\nCNN’s Ivonne Valdes Garay, Isabelle D’Antonio, Rocio Muñoz-Ledo and Mauricio Torres contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "LONDON/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. control of Venezuela's oil exports has ensnared barrels that had been servicing debt to China, lining up another potential showdown between the two superpowers that could further complicate the South American country's path out of default.\n\nAround a tenth of Venezuela's $150 billion foreign debt pile is estimated to be loans from China that ​the OPEC member was paying in oil cargoes - until the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.\n\nDebt experts said the ramifications of China's claim on the cargoes and any clash with ‌the United States could make it tougher for Venezuela to restructure its debt after a 2017 default and put at risk Beijing's cooperation in restructuring deals for other developing nations.\n\n\"Even under the best circumstances, this was going to be very messy - trying to disentangle where all ‌these creditors stand in the credit hierarchy,\" said Christopher Hodge, chief economist with Natixis and a former U.S. Treasury official.\n\n\"The fact that now America is controlling all the finances into and out of the country...this seems to be unprecedented to me, that we're going to have such entanglements, such opacity about the finances of a government,\" Hodge said.\n\nWhile Washington currently controls only oil sale proceeds, Hodge noted that these are Venezuela's main source of revenue.\n\nDocuments and sources from state-run oil firm PDVSA show three supertankers have been shuttling between Venezuela and China over the last five years carrying oil for interest payments under the terms of a temporary deal struck in 2019. But these shipments are only ⁠a fraction of Venezuela's total crude exports to China.\n\nAidData, a research lab at ‌the U.S. university William & Mary that tracks lending, said some cash proceeds from oil sent to China went into an account controlled by Beijing and on to service the debt - even as sanctions and default blocked payments to many of Venezuela's other creditors.\n\nThe Trump administration has now said that proceeds from the sale of Venezuela's oil will go into ‍a Qatar-based account controlled by Washington, potentially giving the U.S. President himself substantial leverage over which creditors get paid, and when.\n\nIn response to a request for comment on the cargoes and debt payments, China's foreign ministry said Beijing \"has repeatedly stated its position\".\n\nBeijing condemned the redirection of Venezuelan oil exports during a January 7 news conference, adding \"legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected\".\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Reuters that Trump had brokered an oil deal with Venezuela ​that \"will benefit the American and Venezuelan people\".\n\nThe Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at the \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which Caracas sold the crude previously, a U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nTraders managing Venezuelan oil ‌sales have offered some to Chinese refiners, but these are private market transactions, not intended as debt payments.\n\n\"The people of Venezuela will collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations,\" the U.S. official said.\n\nThe Venezuelan communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nTrump could yet make a deal with China. However, the planned U.S. takeover of Venezuela's oil sector and control of its revenue could upend the hierarchy of creditors, restructuring advisors warn.\n\n\"All of these things will have the practical effect of subordinating the claims of legacy debtholders,\" said global sovereign debt expert Lee Buchheit, adding it was unclear if Trump had the legal right to determine who gets paid first.\n\nSome $60 billion of Venezuela's bonds tipped into default in 2017, and a restructuring agreement is essential to enable it to borrow again and attract new ⁠investment.\n\nIn a typical restructuring, bilateral lenders come together and agree what losses they will accept, usually via the Paris Club of ​creditor nations. This sets the bar for the \"comparable\" losses private lenders - bond investors, banks and others - must take.\n\n\"Comparability of treatment will be ​a real challenge, particularly if the U.S. controls the use of oil revenues,\" said Mark Walker, a longtime sovereign debt advisor who previously worked on potential Venezuelan restructurings.\n\nIf the U.S. pushes China to swallow significant writedowns on its debt - and China digs its heels in - it could slow a restructuring and hinder Venezuela's economic recovery in the process.\n\nThat could ‍keep Venezuela \"in very dire straits during the foreseeable future\", said ⁠Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging market debt with TT International, which holds Venezuelan bonds. In turn, this would limit how much the country can afford to repay to bondholders and other creditors.\n\nChina has little immediate leverage. Countries typically do not take other nations to court or arbitration over lending claims, Walker said, and would need to settle the situation \"on a government-to-government basis\".\n\nBut ramifications are possible: China is the ⁠largest bilateral lender to the developing world and its cooperation with the Paris Club has been crucial over the past decade. Beijing agreed restructuring terms via a platform called the Common Framework during Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia's debt restructuring talks.\n\n\"China's obvious leverage is to refuse ‌to cooperate in future Common Framework sovereign debt workouts until it feels that it has been treated fairly in Venezuela,\" Buchheit said. \"And that threat would have some force.\"",

Udvar-Hazy Center is located on Dulles Airport property in Chantilly, Virginia, and the observation tower is its highest structure.\n\nParking costs $15, but admission to the museum is free.\n\nWhen I visited in January, the observation tower closed at 4:30 p.m., an hour before the rest of the museum closed at 5:30 p.m.\n\nThe observation tower was my last stop after touring the rest of the museum, so I was grateful for the chance to sit and rest my feet in the waiting area.\n\nAfter a short elevator ride, I arrived at the top of the tower.\n\nLooking down at the museum's 10-story aviation and space hangars from above showed me just how large the entire complex is: 760,000 square feet, to be exact.\n\nAn informational plaque indicated that the Bull Run and Catoctin mountain ranges were 12 miles away, and the Blue Ridge mountains were 23 miles away.\n\nI could see planes taking off and landing at the airport, with some planes passing directly over the observation tower. On a clearer day, I likely would have been able to see more aircraft in the sky.\n\nPlanes take off into the wind for extra lift. Landing into the wind helps them reduce speed.\n\nI could hear air traffic controllers instructing flights to turn certain directions or use certain runways at Dulles, but much of it was jargon meant for pilots.\n\nThe exhibit included a lighting control panel depicting airport runway layouts known as a \"mimic,\" a vacuum tube from a vintage communication radio, and a light gun used to communicate with pilots via lighting signals if radio isn't available.\n\nWhile touring the museum, my guide pointed out the Boeing 367-80 Jet Transport known as \"Dash 80.\" The only model of its kind ever built, the Dash 80 first took off in 1954 and was eventually developed into the first Boeing 707 jetliner, ushering in a new era of commercial air travel.\n\nAfter viewing the museum's vast collection of historic planes, watching passenger jets take off and land at Dulles gave me a deeper appreciation of how much — and how quickly — aviation has changed. I was glad I'd saved the best for last.",

But new warnings from cybersecurity experts have transformed what once looked like a clean energy success story into a geopolitical flashpoint.\n\nOfficials in Australia and the United Kingdom now say some Chinese-made buses may contain code that theoretically lets the buses’ manufacturer shut them down remotely via a so-called “kill switch.”\n\nThe revelation has renewed global fears about foreign-controlled technology embedded in critical infrastructure.\n\nThe spotlight is on the Yutong-made battery-electric buses. It’s a major Chinese manufacturer whose vehicles have been widely purchased in Australia’s capital, Canberra, and other jurisdictions.\n\nBritish reports, citing tests by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and Transport for the UK government, found that similar models in Europe could be accessed remotely by the manufacturer’s systems, including diagnostics and software updates, and that, theoretically, such access could be used to stop a bus’s drive system.\n\nThis marks a dramatic escalation in cyber-risk warnings tied that aren’t about phone networks or internet routers but about public transit vehicles. Transport Canberra reportedly responded by launching a fresh investigation into cybersecurity risks linked to the buses, following the British analysis and earlier flags from Norwegian transit authorities who found what they termed a functional remote shutdown capability during tests.\n\nTo cyber researchers, the worry is not that a Chinese government operator is now flipping switches in real time, since there aren’t any confirmed cases of foreign actors actively disabling buses. The concern is that the vulnerability exists at all in imported vehicles that operate on public streets and, in some cases, carry government employees and personnel.\n\n“This isn’t just about buses,” Australian cybersecurity expert Alastair MacGibbon told local media. “It goes to how much control is embedded in the technology we import, and whether those controls could be abused.”\n\nThis episode in neighboring Australia (ally, we mean) reads like vindication for policymakers in the US who have long sounded the alarm over dependencies on Chinese technology.\n\nTransport Secretary Sean Duffy and other hardliners have repeatedly asserted that Chinese-linked vehicles and connected technologies pose unacceptable security risks — even going so far as to say China should never sell cars (or similarly connected vehicles) on American roads “as long as I have breath in my body.”\n\nWhile those comments were dismissed as bluster by critics, the Australian “kill-switch” story has suddenly given them a concrete, globally reported incident to point to.\n\nIn Washington, the Biden administration tightened restrictions on connected vehicles containing Chinese software or hardware, with new rules designed to ban such imports by model year 2027 — a response to precisely the kinds of national security vulnerabilities highlighted by the Australian case.\n\nOpponents of these policies argue that connectivity features, including remote diagnostics and over-the-air updates, are standard across the global auto and transit industries, not unique to Chinese manufacturers.\n\nIndeed, any modern vehicle with internet connectivity might in theory be accessed remotely, whether made in Beijing, Detroit, or Tokyo. Critics in China have taken to global media to warn that U.S. bans could backfire by raising costs and supply chain challenges for American automakers dependent on global components.\n\nBut for many U.S. national security experts, the defining issue isn’t simply connectivity but control. If a foreign company can access the mission-critical systems of vehicles running on public streets — or the energy grids, solar inverters, or AI systems that undergird modern life — then that access becomes a lever that adversaries could exploit during crises.\n\nThe Australian episode has already spurred official reviews of every Yutong model in service. Transport Canberra officials insist there is no immediate operational concern based on current investigations, and that local buses are updated via physical service centers rather than remote connectivity.\n\nBut the warning’s broader resonance has rippled through capitals from London to Canberra, Oslo to Washington: as nations electrify their transit fleets and embrace connected vehicles, they must also reckon with who controls that connectedness.\n\nAnd for American lawmakers who warned loudly (and, in the eyes of some, prematurely) that Chinese technology on wheels isn’t just another import, this moment may well feel like a long-anticipated reckoning.",

    "fullText": "Thanks to quarterback Jayden Daniels, it became cool to buy Washington Commanders NFL jerseys in 2024. Every time the NFL released a different Daniels' jersey, whether it was the black alternate, the new Super Bowl era jerseys they brought back in 2025, or Salute to Service, they were a big hit.\n\nNow, if you're looking to buy a Daniels' jersey — or any Washington jersey outside of the Super Bowl era throwbacks, you can find them on clearance.\n\nNo, it's not because the Commanders were 5-12 in 2025. Or because fans are still protesting over the name. Instead, it's because Washington's current jerseys will be going away in 2026. The Super Bowl-era throwbacks will likely become the Commanders' permanent uniforms.\n\nX user Zach Cohen often posts on NFL uniforms and designs and released the following video on Thursday:\n\nLet's do this one better... only 4 NFL teams have similarly discounted jerseys on all current players online & in-person at Dick's 🚨\n- Commanders: all except white \"throwbacks\"\n- Falcons: all except black throwbacks\n- Ravens: all \n- Titans: all\n\nNot only are those 4 teams I… https://t.co/kAR7LXDwVB pic.twitter.com/5EIqAMYsd4\n\n— Zach Cohen (@ZachCohenFB) January 22, 2026\n\nCohen is often spot-on when reporting about jerseys and uniforms. And he's right about the discounted price on Commanders' jerseys on Fanatics.\n\nThe Commanders' jerseys were introduced in 2022 when they changed their name. They've never been popular. The jerseys, specifically the burgundy and the black jerseys, were more popular than the white ones. Still, most fans longed for something resembling the franchise's historic past. That's why the Super Bowl-era uniforms were introduced in 2025.\n\nThe longstanding rumor is that these uniforms will become permanent in 2026. The Commanders would also introduce a burgundy jersey resembling the ones they wore as the Redskins. That would explain why each of the jerseys introduced in 2022 is on clearance: they could be going away.\n\nSo, if you want to find a Jayden Daniels or Terry McLaurin jersey, now could be the time.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Clearance jerseys are good news for throwbacks",

    "description": "A look at 20 free agents who have played for a defense with Parker as a coach, and how each performed in 2025.",
    "fullText": "One of the oldest tenets in the NFL is that players tend to follow the coaches who have had positive impacts on their development. With Christian Parker in line to become the next Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator, and with his glowing reputation as a teacher and tactician, it is fair to wonder which former players could be joining him in Dallas.\n\nFans know, the club is in dire need of additional defensive talent. And while Parker is moving up to playcaller for the first time in his career, his relationships with players doesn't necessarily have to be limited to secondary players just because he was the defensive passing game coordinator. There could absolutely be linebackers who have been involved in those meetings who are interested in working for the 34-year old under the bright lights in Dallas.\n\nThe first glimpse is to who are pending free agents within the Philadelphia Eagles organization but things don't stop there. Parker also coached with the Denver Broncos from 2021 through 2023, and players from that era could still easily be able to contribute in 2026.\n\nUnfortunately for the Cowboys, the players who likely have most benefitted from Parker's tutelage are either still under their rookie deals with the Eagles, or have signed on long-term with their team.\n\nPatrick Surtain II: First-team All-Pro\nQuinyon Mitchell: First-team All-Pro\nCooper DeJean: First-team All-Pro\n\n... and all before Christian Parker turns 35. \n\nwelcome to the #Cowboys, sir. https://t.co/vmUEdicnZM\n\n— Patrik [No C] Walker (@VoiceOfTheStar) January 22, 2026\n\nHere's a rundown of the top potential free agents who could now be in the mix in Dallas, tiered by their 2025 Pro Football Focus overall defensive grades.\n\nCB Ja'Quan McMillian (RFA), Denver, 2022-23, 80.3 grade in 2025\n\nMcMillian is a former UDFA who has been a staple in the Denver secondary. They will most likely slap him with a 1st round or 2nd round tender, taking him off the market.\n\nSafety Avonte Maddox, Detroit, 2024, 79.1 grade in 2025\n\nMaddox had an incredible single season in Detroit, but didn't fare as well in Philly. He had a 61.9 overall grade in his one season working with Parker.\n\nSafety CJ Gardner-Johnson, Philadelphia, 2024, 51.4 grade in 2025\n\nNot a great year for Gardner-Johnson in Chicago, but he did have a 77.0 grade w/ Parker in 2024.\n\nLB Justin Strnad, Denver, 2021-23, 72.1 grade in 2025\n\nStrnad barely played while Parker was in Denver, but that doesn't mean they didn't have a chance to form some level of working relationship. Now that he's getting, he's an intriguing option for the Cowboys to fill out their linebacker core with.\n\nCB Fabian Moreau, Minnesota, 2023, 71.4\n\nMoreau has a strong grade, but only played 198 snaps in 2025 as a reserve. Could definitely be added as a depth piece to help round out the roster if Parker liked what he saw their one year together in 2023; Moreau graded out at 62.4 on 739 snaps.\n\nLB Alex Singleton, Denver, 2022-23, 70.1\n\nSingle had a strong first year in Denver with Parker in 2022, his highest graded of his six seasons at 79.1.\n\nSafety PJ Locke, Denver, 2021-23, 63.0\n\nNothing much stands out with Locke, who has mostly been a reserve, but he did have 3 sacks on 11 pash rush snaps in 2023 with Parker.\n\nLB Nakobe Dean, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 62.2\n\nDean has generally been regarded as a bust with the Eagles, but when he got starter snaps through the year in 2024 with Parker, he had a 77.4 grade, including a strong year in both run defense and pass rush.\n\nThose aren't the only back-seven players who are on the free agent market this year, but they are the ones who turned in average-or-better performances. Here's a look at other free agent linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties with ties to Parker.\n\nCB Adoree' Jackson, Philadelphia, 2025, 53.6 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Marcus Epps, Philadelphia, 2025, 51.8 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Reed Blankenship, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 42.6 grade in 2025\n\nLB Ben Van Sumeren (RFA), Philadelphia, 2024-25, N/A\n\nLB Josey Jewell, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Justin Simmons, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Kareem Jackson, Out of the League, 2021-22\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Eagles, NFL free agents who may follow DC Christian Parker to Cowboys",

This ate into the president’s schedule and whittled away the notoriously light sleeper’s opportunity for some shut-eye.\n\nThe president swapped planes back in the capital and continued his journey, heavily delayed, to Switzerland. His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico sent 37 cartel members to the United States at the request of the U.S. Justice Department, with President Claudia Sheinbaum saying Wednesday that it was a “sovereign decision” by her government.\n\nSheinbaum responded to criticism from analysts and opponents who said that the transfers on Tuesday were the result of mounting pressure from Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to take military action on cartels.\n\nSheinbaum said that although the transfers were made at the request of the U.S. government, the decision was taken by the National Security Council after analyzing what was “convenient for Mexico” and in terms of its “national security.”\n\n“Mexico is put first above all else, even if they ask for whatever they have to ask for. It is a sovereign decision,” she said at her regular morning news briefing.\n\nSheinbaum, who has been praised for her level-headed management of relations with Trump, has been forced to walk a fine line between making concessions to the Trump administration and projecting strength both domestically and internationally.\n\nObservers say that the Mexican government has used the transfers as a sort of pressure valve to offset demands by Trump and show authorities are cracking down on criminal groups. Tension has only mounted since the U.S. carried out a military operation in Venezuela to capture then President Nicolás Maduro to face charges in the United States in an extraordinary use of force that set leaders across Latin America on edge.\n\nThose sent to the U.S. on Tuesday were alleged members of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, known by its Spanish acronym CJNG, and the Sinaloa Cartel, which Washington has designated as terrorist organizations, and a number of other groups. It’s the third such transfer of capos over the past year. Mexico’s government said it has sent 92 people in total to the U.S. in total.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday said that the transfer was a “landmark achievement in the Trump administration’s mission to destroy the cartels.”\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said that the move was an “important step” by Mexico's government and that collaboration was in both countries' shared interest.\n\n“These 37 cartel members — including terrorists from the Sinaloa Cartel, CJNG, and others – will now pay for their crimes against the American people on American soil,” Bondi said in a statement with other U.S. Justice Department officials.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said it had already indicted at least one of the people transferred, Armando Gómez Núñez, who was accused of being a senior leader of CJNG. He is charged with drug offenses and the possession of weapons like machine guns and “explosive devices.”\n\nIn August, Mexico's security minister acknowledged that some of the cartel leaders sent to the United States at that time were continuing criminal operations from prison and that their transfer was agreed upon because there was a risk they could be released because of judicial rulings.\n\nMatthew Lee contributed to this report from Washington.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "description": "Robert Saleh has history with Cowboys d-line coach Aaron Whitecotton",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans have just made 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh their next head coach. That may seem like a weird news post for a Cowboys blog, but the ripple effect could impact Dallas’ search for its next defensive boss. Current defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton, who is among the interviewed candidates for the DC job, may be on Saleh’s wishlist for his staff in Tennessee.\n\nWhen Saleh was the head coach of the New York Jets from 2021-2024, Whitecotton was his defensive line coach. After Saleh was fired two years ago, Whitecotton was able to make the lateral move to coach the defensive front in Dallas. He was attractive to the Cowboys based on excellent results with the Jets’ defense, particularly helping Quinnen Williams to become an All-Pro talent among other strong performers. When Dallas traded for Williams last October, he was clearly excited to reunite with Whitecotton.\n\nThe relationship between Saleh and Whitecotton runs deeper than the Jets tenure. They were both part of Gus Bradley’s staff in Jacksonville from 2014-2016, when Saleh was the linebackers coach and Whitecotton was just getting started as a d-line assistant. When Saleh left to become the 49ers’ DC, Whitecotton ended up in Buffalo for a few years. But Saleh brought him on staff in 2020, and then Whitecotton followed him to New York the following year. So there’s already been a point where, after time apart, they started working together again.\n\nGiven all this history, it would be no surprise if Saleh would like to resume their collaboration. But for that to happen, it would likely only come by making him the Jets’ defensive coordinator. Whitecotton is still under contract with Dallas and, unlike most other assistants, wasn’t one of Matt Eberflus’ guys. Considering the Cowboys have considered him for their own DC vacancy, they will almost certainly be retaining him as the defensive line coach at the very least. In that case, the only way New York could get him without Dallas’ consent is through a promotion.\n\nThe hire makes sense beyond just the relationship. Saleh has already made it clear that he plans to be the defensive play-caller in Tennessee. That could be attractive to Whitecotton as a first-time coordinator, allowing him to focus more on the other duties of the job initially. Saleh likely intends to be very hands-on with the defense in multiple ways, so a new coordinator with an existing rapport would be a great fit for that.\n\nAdmittedly, we are making the assumption that Robert Saleh would want Aaron Whitecotton back, and that Whitecotton would want to work for him. Hopefully, if they do reunite, it means the Cowboys only have to replace their defensive line coach. We don’t know where Whitecotton ranked on their list of defensive coordinator candidates, with plenty of outside guys being interviewed as well. But as this coaching carousel continues to spin, this is one horse that could impact what happens in Dallas and is worth watching.",

    "fullText": "Why did the Titans hire Robert Saleh? Former 49ers DC, Jets head coach lands in Tennessee to lead Cam Ward originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans have found their next voice to lead Cam Ward.\n\nRobert Saleh is finalizing a deal with the Titans to become their next head coach, Adam Schefter reported late Monday night. The news comes after Saleh completed two official interviews with the team, and \"the two sides impressed each other enough to move forward together,\" per Schefter.\n\nNow, Saleh, the San Francisco 49ers’ defensive coordinator in 2025 and former New York Jets head coach, will be tasked with helping the Titans return to prominence in the AFC after multiple seasons of struggles, with a franchise quarterback already in place.\n\nHere’s what to know about the Titans hiring Saleh.\n\n3 reasons why every team remaining will (and won't) win Super Bowl\n\nInside the Patriots vs. Broncos AFC championship matchup\n\nPredicting the Super Bowl 60 matchup\n\nBreaking down Seahawks vs. Rams NFC championship matchup\n\nThe Titans' hire is set to be the fourth of the 2026 NFL coaching cycle, with John Harbaugh heading to the Giants, Kevin Stefanski heading to the Falcons and Jeff Hafley heading to the Dolphins. As Tennessee moved through its interview processes, it became apparent that Saleh was one of the favorites for the job.\n\nAccording to Schefter, Saleh spent Monday in Tennessee with the team, and \"the two sides impressed each other enough to move forward together.\" Ian Rapoport added that Saleh \" impressed during the interview process.\"\n\nMatt Nagy was also believed to be one of the top candidates for the Titans' head coaching role — the team announced Monday that it had completed second interviews with both Nagy and Saleh, two former head coaches.\n\nWe've completed in-person interviews with the following candidates. pic.twitter.com/Mctvgl2U5K\n\n— Tennessee Titans (@Titans) January 20, 2026\n\nInterestingly, Saleh, a defensive mind, was the choice over Nagy, an offensive mind. Saleh brings a mix of defensive prowess, leadership and head coaching experience to the Titans, an organization certainly needing stability after a 3-14 season.\n\nSaleh will be a head coach for the second time, as he led the Jets from 2021-24. That stint did not go too well — he racked up a 20-36 record — but Saleh wasn't always viewed as the sole person to blame for New York's struggles. At best, he helped bring more of an edge to the Jets, including his time leading Aaron Rodgers.\n\nAfter being fired five games into the 2024 season, Saleh wound up heading to the 49ers as Kyle Shanahan's defensive coordinator in the 2025 season, finding plenty of success despite a long list of injuries. The Titans were clearly impressed, now hoping Saleh can help them improve upon a defense that gave up 345.1 yards per game this past season.\n\nAccording to Jordan Schultz, Saleh indicated to teams in interviews that he planned to call defensive plays if he became a head coach again, which he did not do with the Jets.\n\nSaleh will also have an opportunity to join a hyped young quarterback, as Cam Ward had a quiet rookie season, but the Titans are hopeful last year's No. 1 overall pick will continue blossoming toward stardom.\n\nAs a side note, Saleh is now set to face Liam Coen's Jaguars squad twice per season.

Here's a look at his record in New York.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about the Falcons hiring Kevin Stefanski\n\nSaleh has had an extensive coaching career that includes time in college, a long list of NFL assistant roles, and now two head coaching jobs. Notably, he is set to coach his third AFC South team, having previously spent time with the Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars as an assistant.\n\nSaleh’s coaching career began in 2002 as an offensive assistant at Michigan State. He became a defensive assistant for the team in 2003, guiding defensive linemen, and the following year held the same role at Central Michigan.\n\nIn 2005, Saleh moved to Georgia as a defensive assistant leading linebackers. Later that year, he made the jump to the NFL as a defensive intern for the Texans. He became a defensive quality control coach for Houston from 2006–08, then an assistant linebackers coach from 2009–10.\n\nIn 2011, Saleh joined the Seattle Seahawks as a defensive quality control coach, remaining in that role until 2013, when he joined the Jaguars as a linebackers coach.\n\nSaleh’s first stint as the 49ers’ defensive coordinator began in 2017, helping lead the team to the Super Bowl in 2019. He served as San Francisco’s DC under Kyle Shanahan from 2017–20.\n\nIn 2021, the Jets hired Saleh as their head coach, but his four-year run did not result in any playoff appearances. New York built some solid defenses under Saleh but failed to break through, and after a 2-3 start in 2024, they parted ways with him.\n\nSaleh spent a bit of time as a consultant for the Packers before returning to the 49ers as defensive coordinator for the 2025 season.

    "description": "The Washington Commanders and head coach Dan Quinn made another bold move, promoting Darnell Stapleton to offensive line coach.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders made a bold move on Monday, promoting assistant offensive line coach Darnell Stapleton to offensive line coach. This comes less than two weeks after head coach Dan Quinn promoted assistant quarterbacks coach David Blough to offensive coordinator.\n\nWhy is this a bold move? Blough had only two years of coaching experience when he was promoted. While many around the NFL, including everyone in Washington's building, believe the former NFL quarterback is a future coaching star, the 30-year-old had led only a position group for a couple of weeks late in the 2025 season, after Tavita Pritchard left to become Stanford's head coach.\n\nMany believed that after firing offensive line coach Bobby Johnson and parting ways with offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, the Commanders would look to bring in an experienced voice for Blough. Last week, Blough also hired former college teammate Danny Etling as the assistant quarterbacks coach, after hiring D.J. Williams to be the new quarterbacks coach.\n\nWashington reportedly likes Stapleton's ability to develop players, and he received internal praise for first-round pick Josh Conerly's growth as a rookie in 2025. Stapleton and Blough worked together as assistant position coaches and are said to have a strong rapport.\n\nWill this work for Washington? Only time will tell. Quinn is betting his future on it.\n\nHow did everyone receive the news that the Commanders promoted another young assistant coach? We surveyed some of the top reactions via X.\n\nMentioned Stapleton the other day on the podcast as a good possibility. Good rapport with the OL and was heavily involved in protection schemes and other aspects of the O. Aligned with Blough’s vision. https://t.co/LCBF5U1GXz\n\n— John Keim (@john_keim) January 19, 2026\n\nThe moves make sense in a lot of ways. Stapleton has a good rapport with OC David Blough, is well-liked by players and was involved in game planning and protection plans last season. https://t.co/6tKA0tCnuN\n\n— Nicki Jhabvala (@NickiJhabvala) January 19, 2026\n\nDan Quinn disliked the offense enough to part with Kliff Kingsbury & Bobby Johnson but liked the offense enough to promote David Blough, Darnell Stapleton & Shane Toub.\n\nNot saying any of this is wrong (there's a lot we don't know), but this is an unusual offensive-staff revamp.\n\n— Al Galdi (@AlGaldi) January 19, 2026\n\nWith Stapleton being promoted, I think we're about to see the Commanders become a much more zone-based run team. Will be interesting to see if they get under center more or lean more on the pistol\n\n— Mark Bullock (@MarkBullockNFL) January 19, 2026\n\nStapleton has been an OL coach in college & played in the pros\n\nToub has been working with OL as a QC coach, & was the team captain of his team at Dayton as a Center.\n\nBoth have OL credentials certainly, still feels odd team’s leaning so heavy on limited experience in the roles https://t.co/cvWopL4LXH\n\n— T “Resh” Manuel (@reshmanuel) January 19, 2026\n\nThis is an educated guess. Stapleton was part of zone team in college. Commanders OL is super athletic and suited to zone, so are the RBs & TEs.\n\nAlso, the briefing on Stapleton was \"involved in protection plans\", not run game. Run game under Kliff/Johnson was heavy gap scheme\n\n— Mark Bullock (@MarkBullockNFL) January 19, 2026\n\nThe #Commanders will essentially be rolling out the same offensive coaching staff MINUS Kliff Kingsbury and Tavita Pritchard.\n\nOn one hand, continuity is king for a young QB.\n\nOn the other, somewhat uninspiring hires with a cycle of good coaches out. 🤔#RaiseHail https://t.co/yOMYFuGhPa\n\n— George Carmi (@Gcarmi21) January 19, 2026\n\nYeah…. Just seems odd to promote the assistants under the guys that were let go and hoping for a more desirable outcome. pic.twitter.com/B3Y6GWhlnw\n\n— Filterle$$ 🗣🤌🏻🎙 (@tambascosauce69) January 19, 2026\n\nDarnell Stapleton will get a up close look at the OL on the National side in the senior bowl — pretty excited about that.\n\n— Cornelius Kidwell (@ExcuseTheHebrew) January 19, 2026\n\ncurious. https://t.co/dVAFS9ffMb\n\n— Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) January 19, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Fans, others react to Darnell Stapleton move",

We distinguish the architectural contribution (Tier-1 including components, interfaces, and operating model) from expected outcomes contingent on adoption (Tier-2). The latter includes local-first autonomy with global interoperability, near-real-time operation with local buffering, removal of EV-charging bottlenecks, freed grid capacity for data centers and industrial electrification, as well as a trend toward low, predictable, fixed-cost clean energy.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\n\nCobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong \"procedural vehicle\" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nLast month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.\n\nA day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.\n\nOn Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.\n\n“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.\n\nDemocracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.\n\n“We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,” she said in a statement.\n\nTwelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.\n\nA law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.\n\n\"Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,\" plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nJustice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.\n\n“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.\n\n“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.\n\n“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",

    "description": "Worried about losing unified Republican power in Washington and mystified at his lack of support among the public, President Donald Trump keeps talking about not holding the November midterm elections, when Republicans could lose control of the House, Senate or both.",
    "fullText": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, \n\nWorried about losing unified Republican power in Washington and mystified at his lack of support among the public, President Donald Trump keeps talking about not holding the November midterm elections, when Republicans could lose control of the House, Senate or both.\n\nTrump doesn’t understand why his approval rating is underwater (and it is, on every issue, in a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS and released Friday).\n\n“I wish you could explain to me what the hell’s going on with the mind of the public,” he told House Republicans in a speech earlier this month.\n\nLater, he added: “Now, I won’t say, ‘Cancel the election. They should cancel the election,’ because the fake news will say, ‘He wants the elections canceled. He’s a dictator.’”\n\nBut Trump did talk about canceling the election in an interview with Reuters this week. He said Republicans have been so successful that “when you think of it, we shouldn’t even have an election.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said the president was “joking” and “being facetious” about canceling the election.\n\nIf it’s a joke, it’s material he’s been working on for months. Told during an appearance with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last September that Ukraine won’t hold an election during a period of martial law during its war with Russia, Trump expressed some envy.\n\n“So you say during the war, you can’t have elections,” Trump said. “So let me just say, three and a half years from now – so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections? Oh, that’s good.”\n\nTrump routinely says things that seem like trolls until they don’t. Owning Greenland? Not a joke. However, he seems to have retreated from the oft-repeated idea of an unconstitutional third term.\n\nAnd for the record, unlike Ukraine, the US has held elections in the midst of multiple wars, when the British had invaded in 1812 and when it was at war with itself in 1864. It held elections during world wars when millions of Americans fought overseas in the 20th century as well.\n\nTrump knows that presidents rarely pick up seats in a midterm. His administration has been moving at breakneck speed to change the government because, as his chief of staff famously said, they know that presidents expect to lose power after their first two years. A net loss of just a handful of seats would give control of the House to Democrats, for instance, requiring their buy-in for spending and giving them power to investigate his administration.\n\nThe Constitution requires that a new Congress be sworn in on January 3, 2027. Election Day is set in law, so it is theoretically feasible for Congress to move it, but not to cancel the election. Elections are supposed to be administered by each state, so state governors and legislatures could, in theory, move their own elections to deal with a major disaster, but there’s no precedent for it. To get into the weeds of all of this, read a report from the Congressional Research Service.\n\nTrump has also mused about using emergency powers to meddle with elections. He told the New York Times recently that he regrets not directing National Guards to seize voting machines after the 2020 election.\n\nEven the elections he has won, he has said were rigged. There’s still no evidence of any widespread voter fraud, even after all these years of the Trump era.\n\nElection officials say they are thinking very carefully about all of this. Asked about Trump’s musings at an event sponsored by The Atlantic this week, Arizona’s top election official, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said this:\n\n“The fact that we’re running through these scenarios in the first place should tell you something about the health of our democracy,” Fontes added.\n\nTo that end, he would not elaborate on what scenarios they’re preparing for.\n\n“I don’t want to give the bad guys any ideas,” Fontes said.\n\nWhile Trump might fantasize about canceling the election, the reality is that the election system is already changing in some key ways. Some of them may be enormously consequential.\n\nRepublicans have drawn themselves nine more friendly seats across the country, and Democrats have ended up with six, mostly in California. Republicans see additional opportunity in Florida, while Democrats plan a redistricting ballot initiative in Virginia in April. Read more.\n\nIf the Supreme Court decides to further gut the Voting Rights Act, Republicans could in theory redraw maps in many other states. Read takeaways from October’s oral arguments.\n\nThe long-term result of more and more political gerrymandering without protections for racial minority-focused districts could be the smothering of minority-party delegations in multiple states, making the House map look increasingly more like the presidential map. Far fewer Democratic districts in Texas. Far fewer Republican districts in California — even though there are millions of both Republicans and Democrats in both states.\n\nWhile much of the effort has been stopped, for now, by courts, Trump’s goal is to exert more executive control over elections that are supposed to be governed by Congress and states.\n\nA federal court on Thursday sided with California against the administration’s demand that the state turn over information on its 23 million voters.\n\nThe Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether mail-in ballots that are postmarked by, but arrive after Election Day can still be counted. The decision could have serious consequences for the country’s large scale adoption of mail-in voting in recent years. Trump is a loud skeptic of the practice even though he has personally voted by mail. His executive order would also scramble how states use voting machines, another response to phantom voter fraud that could actually drastically slow down the counting of ballots.\n\nEarly on, his administration scaled back the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, which is meant to helps states guard their election systems from attack. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem canceled funding for an information sharing network that helped states detect and ward off coordinated hacking attacks, as CNN reported last year.\n\nHis Justice Department has rewired the agency’s Civil Rights Division away from its original core mission of civil rights abuses, including those related to elections. One current focus of the division is to help states “clean” voter rolls, although a judge recently ruled that effort was a misapplication of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nTrump’s administration has already tried to change how people vote through executive action, and who they vote for through changing maps.\n\nThere’s a lot of time for more gaming the system between now and November, and Trump clearly already has the midterms on the brain.",

    "fullText": "On Friday, the Washington Capitals recalled forward Ivan Miroshnichenko from the AHL’s Hershey Bears. In addition, the team placed forward Justin Sourdif on injured reserve (IR).\n\nMiroshnichenko, 21, previously made his season debut for the Capitals on Dec. 20, and also played the next day on Dec. 21. In Hershey this season, the Russian forward has recorded 16 points (6 goals, 10 assists).\n\nMiroshnichenko had a stellar 2024-25 campaign with the Bears, setting career highs in goals (23), assists (19), and points (42). The forward’s 23 goals led Hershey, while his 42 points ranked third on the team.\n\nThe Capitals selected Miroshnichenko in the first round (20th overall) of he 2022 NHL Draft. He has recorded 10 points (3 goals, 7 assists) in 41 career NHL games. Additionally, Miroshnichenko has 83 points (38 goals, 45 assists) in 120 career AHL games.\n\nMeanwhile, Sourdif, 23, has been a quality addition to the Capitals this season. The rookie has recorded 19 points (9 goals, 10 assists) in 45 games.\n\nSourdif was selected in the third round (87th overall) by the Florida Panthers in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft. Last summer, he was traded to the Capitals and signed a two-year, $1.65 million contract extension the next day.\n\nThe Capitals have struggled since the team’s last winning streak ended in early December, going 7-9-4 across 20 games. One of the main factors of the slump has been injuries.\n\nThe Capitals already lost Pierre-Luc Dubois in late October for a majority of the season. During the recent slump, the team has been without various players in the lineup at points, due to injuries/illnesses. That list includes Sourdif, Ryan Leonard, Tom Wilson, Aliaksei Protas, and Jakob Chychrun.\n\nPyotr Kochetkov Injury Update; Agent Projects Potential Early Return\n\nWho Is Kyle Masters: Analyzing Hurricanes Trade With Sharks\n\nCanadiens Analysis: Fowler’s Results After 10 NHL Games",

    "title": "How Semafor turned Washington into a profit center",
    "description": "Semafor CEO Justin Smith explains how his company bucked industry trends by focusing on Washington, DC, and the \"global leadership class.\"",
    "fullText": "The news business is gloomy these days, and lots of companies are bracing for more grim news: Changes in the distribution landscape are making it harder to get the news you produce in front of people who want to consume it, which means you have less revenue to make more compelling news. Which can lead to a grim cycle.\n\nBut last week, Semafor, which pitches itself as a news outlet for the global leadership class, said it was bucking the trend: The startup, launched by former BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith and former Bloomberg executive Justin Smith in 2022, had turned a profit in 2025.\n\nThe speed at which Semafor has made this work is surprising. The business plan is less so: Semafor, like other recent successful news startups, has built itself by aiming squarely at Washington, DC, and positioning itself as a way for advertisers to reach powerful CEOs and government officials who do business there.\n\nI talked to Semafor CEO Justin Smith (he's not related to Ben Smith) about why the Washington market is lucrative and how his company thinks it can make more money in the future. You can listen to our entire conversation on my Channels podcast; what follows are edited excerpts from our chat.\n\nPeter Kafka: You folks just announced that you were profitable last year, your third year in operation. You also announced that you had raised another $30 million, and made a profit of $2 million on $40 million in revenue. If you're making money, why did you raise more money?\n\nJustin Smith: If you've been in the media business for 30 years, you know the media business is pretty unpredictable. Just because you've had a good couple of years, and you've developed what we think is a really interesting model — if there's a chance to raise money, with good long-term investors, to accelerate the things that are working, it's a good idea.\n\nWe feel like it's taken three years, but we've got the foundation of what we believe is an interesting innovation in the media space. It's a new formula that is working, and we feel like we can extend it across the world and across new markets, and that's what we're going to use the new capital for.\n\nSemafor has leaned heavily into events since you launched, and you say 50% of your revenue comes from events. But that's a very hard business to scale. How do you think you'll grow?\n\nWe did almost a hundred events this year. But a lot of the energy and focus of our event strategy is around some of the bigger convenings that we do. As we go forward, the idea is not necessarily to go from a hundred to 200 to 300 events.\n\nThe strategy is much more likely to be to build a series of tentpoles that themselves become larger, more significant, more valuable commercially, more influential editorially. That's how you scale it.\n\nI've seen people talking about your ambition to take on Davos, the annual global business/policy conference happening this month. Is that a real plan?\n\nWhen we started Semafor, in the original business plan deck, we saw an opportunity to build a leading CEO convening in the United States. We looked at the US market, and we thought, \"It's interesting. This is the largest economy in the world, and there is not a dominant leading CEO convening platform.\"\n\nWe thought that was an interesting fact, which presented an opportunity. So from the very beginning, we envisioned building this from scratch. And we identified Washington, DC, as the best location to do this, which was also a little bit of an unusual choice.\n\nDC's historically not been a place where CEOs travel. It's not been historically a center of business, but that of course has been changing across the last five to seven years: The role of geopolitics in the boardroom, the rise of regulation — all these different trends have converged and now CEOs from both the United States and across the world find themselves in Washington three, four, five, 10 times a year. And we were fortunate because we made that bet.\n\nPeter: You've been describing a business that's very DC-based. You are based in DC. It's really striking that some of the most successful media startups of the last few years — you guys, Axios, Punchbowl, Puck, to some extent — are all making money or trying to make money in Washington, by matching advertisers with powerful people. How much bigger can that market get?\n\nIt's effectively a B2B marketplace. What's sometimes confusing to people is that many of these news properties, including Semafor, are consumer-facing now — consumer web pages and consumer-focused newsletters. But since the audience that they're appealing to is this segment of this leadership audience, it allows for a much more targeted type of business monetization.\n\nIn this case, it's the corporate affairs market, which is largely corporate reputation. There's also a bit of advocacy advertising.\n\nFacebook saying, \"We believe healthy regulation is a great idea.\"\n\nExactly. This market has existed for a long time, and there was a whole predecessor group of brands before Politico and Axios. You may remember Roll Call, or the Hill, or National Journal. Those were some of the most successful and profitable and commercially viable media businesses around.\n\nObviously, these new digital disruptors came along and stole the market from those legacy players. But I think what also happened is that the market grew really, really dramatically because the intersection of government and business has become more pronounced and more intense.\n\nI think the stakes have gotten higher and higher and higher for companies operating in the US, and their needs to communicate their corporate brand positions have gotten more urgent.\n\nI had heard early on that you guys were going to make your version of the networks' Sunday shows, which is fueled by that same economy.\n\nThose were some of the most profitable TV shows on television back in the day. They probably still are today.\n\nYou guys have not launched your version of a Sunday show. Do you think that's something you'll try?\n\nWe actually started with a video investment. We thought, \"Let's see if we can produce this opinion leader video.\" We tried, and were unable to really figure it out, and we ended up killing it within six months or so.\n\nBecause as a startup, I think that's probably one of the better decisions we made — just to focus on the stuff that's working, and stop doing the stuff that's not working.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

    "title": "Gonzaga at Washington State Preview With Cougars Junior Forward Rihards Vavers",
    "description": "Hear from Washington State Cougars junior forward Rihards Vavers before the Battle in the Palouse.",
    "fullText": "The Washington State Cougars (8-10, 3-2 WCC) had to deal with a plentiful amount of turnover during the offseason, losing the likes of senior guard Nate Calmese (Wake Forest Demon Deacons), redshirt junior forward LeJuan Watts (Texas Tech Red Raiders). and sophomore guard Isiah Watts (Maryland Terrapins). Even with forward Cedric Coward, who now plays for the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nThis season’s group has had its downs. That included a rough experience at the Maui Invitational (only beat the host Chaminade Silverswords), followed by three straight losses at the Bradley Braves, vs. the Nevada Wolfpack, and the USC Trojans.\n\nHeading over to West Coast Conference play, the Cougars have a rough stretch of back-to-back-to-back competition. They lost at home to the Saint Mary’s Gaels (88-82) this past Saturday, Jan. 10, have the upcoming bout with the No. 9 Gonzaga Bulldogs (17-1, 5-0 WCC), and then head down to the Bay Area to take on the San Francisco Dons on Saturday, Jan. 18.\n\nWashington State junior forward Rihards Vavers knows a thing or two about a crazy travel schedule, as he hails from Adazi, Latvia. The Slipper Still Fits chatted with him before the matchup with the Zags and asked him who some of his favorite Latvian basketball inspirations.\n\n“The obvious one would be Kristaps Porzingis. I grew up watching him. The Bertans brothers. Arthur Jagas, he’s a point guard playing in the EuroLeague. There’s a lot of good people now coming out of Latvia. It’s been cool to see everybody grow and expand their game.”\n\nStarting out his collegiate career with the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference’s Quinnipiac Bobcats in Hamden, Connecticut, Vavers has always been a top-shelf shooter, shooting 39.5 percent from beyond the arc through his 57 career games played.\n\nLast season with the Cougars, Vavers didn’t get to show all that he’s capable of, as he was dealing with injuries. He only played 17 games in 2024-25 as he had suffered broken bones in both hands.\n\nIn 2025-26, the 6-7, 210-pound product is scoring 9.4 points per game on a shooting split of 42.5 field goal percentage/37.8 three-point percentage/82.4 free throw percentage to go along with 3.2 rebounds per game. Vavers has started five of the 17 games that he’s played this season.\n\nSince coming to Pullman, coach David Riley’s coaching style has helped open up Vavers’ game.\n\n“He just see the confidence in me. He just sees how great of a shooter I am and my teammates do as well. They find me, they believe in me. Once I got my team behind my back, I just come out every night and attack the basket, read the game. Riley’s confidence and all the coaching staff’s confidence in me has really been helping me.”\n\nOne teammate that Vavers has all the confidence in the world is true freshman Ace Glass. The skilled guard has made an immediate impact in Washington State’s backcourt, averaging a team-leading 15.9 points on a shooting split of 47.5 field goal percentage/35.6 three-point percentage/87.5 free throw percentage.\n\n“It’s crazy that he’s a freshman. He’s learning every day. He still asks a lot of questions. Even though he’s one of our best players, he’s still curious about every single thing going on the court. He’s just trying to get that experience… He sees the game differently. He’s a scorer. He’s learning how to play defense… It’s just been amazing to see him grow ever since we got here, since the summer and up until now… I’m so happy for him. And he has so much potential.”\n\nThe first meeting between the Zags and the Cougars dates all the way back to 1907. Washington State leads the all-time series over Gonzaga, 98-54. Although the Zags have won the last seven meetings.\n\nVavers is aware of how much this Eastern Washington rivalry being back means to the state, and as the two programs transition into the revamped Pac-12 Conference.\n\n“It’s great playing guys like from Gonzaga and just getting after it. We get like two – maybe three opportunities, including the tournament, to play against them. So going up against the best of the best to challenge you and just to see what you’ve been working on all year. It’s just a great matchup to play against a top ten team. I feel like we’ve been preparing and growing up ever since the season started.”\n\nThe Beasley Coliseum in the Palouse fits over 12,000 fans. The arena will bring together some of the finest college basketball fans from all over the surrounding area, and Vavers is expecting a deafening environment.\n\n“Students are finally back on campus. Last year was crazy. Hope this year is going to be amazing too. It’s going to be a good game and can’t wait to see everybody out there.”\n\nThe matchup between the two programs tips off on Thursday, Jan. 15, at 7:00 p.m. PT on the CBS Sports Network.\n\nGet off to an early start, close even stronger\n\nThis has been a continuous issue for Gonzaga when it comes to high energy from the get-go, recently against the Seattle U RedHawks and Santa Clara Broncos at the McCarthey Athletic Center. The same goes for giving up a large lead and slacking off in the second half at the Jenny Craig Pavilion against the San Diego Toreros.\n\nPlay competitive basketball for a full 40 minutes.\n\nDefend the ball screen, jump into passing lanes\n\nAmongst the rest of the West Coast Conference programs, the Cougars struggle with taking care of and sharing the ball. Washington State ranks No. 11 with 13.5 turnovers per game and last at No. 12 with 12.4 assists per game.\n\nThe struggles at the charity stripe, as of late, continue for coach Mark Few’s unit. The Zags rank No. 9 out of 12 teams in the West Coast Conference in that category at 70.0 percent.\n\nAccording to FanDuel Sportsbook, Gonzaga is the favorite over Washington State by a massive 17.5 points. Moneyline for the Zags is at -2800, +1160 for the Cougars. The over/under is set at 157.5.\n\nGonzaga is currently riding a ten-game winning streak and is on the No. 2/No. 3 seed line for the NCAA Tournament.\n\nArden Cravalho is a Gonzaga University graduate from the Bay Area… Follow him on X @a_cravalho",

    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers have precious few assistant coaches on their staff with lengthy pedigrees in the NFL, and there is a chance they could lose one of those few who do have track records in the league to another job this offseason.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Dallas Cowboys submitted a request to the Packers to interview defensive line coach Demarcus Covington for their vacant defensive coordinator position, according to Josina Anderson. The Dallas job came open shortly after the end of the regular season when the Cowboys fired Matt Eberflus (yes, the former Chicago Bears’ head coach) from the job.\n\nCovington does have past experience as a DC, serving in that capacity for the New England Patriots during the 2024 season. That tenure ended when head coach Jerod Mayo was fired, and it immediately preceded his arrival in Green Bay last offseason.\n\nBecause of that experience, Covington was likely to be a candidate for the DC job in Green Bay if Jeff Hafley were to leave for a head coaching job elsewhere. That possibility may still be on the table, but the Cowboys appear to be getting out ahead of a potential Hafley move.",

    "description": "The Tennessee Titans interviewed former Cincinnati Bengals and current Indianapolis Colts DC Lou Anarumo for their open head coach position.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans conducted an interview with Lou Anarumo for the team’s head coaching vacancy. Here's everything you need to know about the Titans' coaching candidate.\n\nAnarumo, 59, is the defensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts. He worked as Cincinnati’s defensive coordinator from 2019-24, guiding the Bengals to one Super Bowl appearance. Before his time in Cincinnati, he also worked as a defensive backs coach in Miami and for the New York Giants.\n\nUnder Anarumo’s leadership, the Colts ranked 21st in scoring defense, 23rd in total defense and 17th in yards allowed per play in 2025. In Anarumo’s seven full seasons as a defensive coordinator, his units only finished in the top half of the NFL in scoring defense or total defense one time, when the 2022 Bengals ranked fifth in scoring.\n\nThat said, Anarumo’s individual gameplans, especially in the postseason, have drawn him some attention. In seven playoff games with Cincinnati, Anarumo’s defenses allowed an average of just 19 points per game, including wins over Josh Allen’s Buffalo Bills, Lamar Jackson’s Baltimore Ravens and Patrick Mahomes’ Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAnarumo rose the coaching ranks initially by coaching defensive backs in colleges. He worked everywhere from Harvard to Marshall to Purdue.\n\nOne sticking point for Titans fans regarding Anarumo’s hire might be his connection to Cincinnati. Namely, he worked on the same Bengals staffs under Zac Taylor that former Titans coach Brian Callahan worked on, and hiring from the same program after firing Callahan so early in his tenure would be a strange decision.\n\nThe Titans fired Callahan in October after a 1-5 start to the 2025 season that followed a 3-14 debut year in 2024. Under interim coach Mike McCoy, the Titans finished the 2025 season with another 3-14 record and earned the No. 4 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Titans have announced completed head coach interviews with the following candidates:\n\nKevin Stefanski, former Browns HC\n\nJason Garrett, former Cowboys HC\n\nThe Titans have also scheduled interviews with or requested interviews from the following candidates: Former Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, former Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris, former Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley and San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh.\n\nNick Suss is the Titans beat writer for The Tennessean.

    "fullText": "Human remains found in Washington have been identified as those of Clarence Edwin “Ed” Asher, a former Oregon mayor who vanished in 2006.\n\nAsher, the former mayor of Fossil, Oregon, was presumed by authorities to have drowned during a crabbing trip in September 2006, according to Oregon outlet KATU. He was 72 years old when he was declared dead.\n\nRemains were found on a beach along the Washington coast shortly after Asher disappeared, but were named under “John Doe” after authorities were unable to identify them.\n\nLast year, DNA was sent to Othram, a lab in Texas that specializes in cold cases, where the remains were finally identified.\n\nThe Coast Guard launched a search and rescue operation in 2006 following Asher’s disappearance at Tillamook Bay, on the coast of Oregon, but the search was suspended after just one day. At the time, Coast Guard members found Asher’s boat idling in the water with live crab onboard.\n\nAsher’s wife, who died in 2018 at the age of 85, had told authorities her husband could not swim.\n\nThe former mayor worked as a lineman technician for the Fossil Telephone Company for nearly 50 years and volunteered as a fireman and ambulance driver, according to his obituary. He also opened a variety store at one point.

    "description": "The Montreal Canadiens played a great game in Washington for 40 minutes, and then the wheels fell off the wagon. While Samuel Montembeault put up a great fight, he just couldn't do it all on his own, and Montreal lost 3-2 in overtime.",
    "fullText": "After claiming a 6-3 win against the Vancouver Canucks on Monday night, the Montreal Canadiens were taking on the Washington Capitals on Tuesday night. Alexander Ovechkin and the Caps have had the Habs’ number of late, but without Tom Wilson, Jacob Chychrun, Justin Sourdif and Pierre-Luc Dubois, the locals came out flat, so to speak.\n\nOf course, the Caps still had Alexander Ovechkin, but the Great Eight is not as much of a threat without his proper supporting cast. Even on the power play, the sniper still just stands there waiting for the perfect feed, even though it’s clearly not coming. At times, the fans even booed their once-devastating man advantage. Still, thanks to a fantastic third frame, the Capitals came back from 0-2 to win 3-2 in overtime.\n\nEx-Canadiens First-Rounder Lands Extension With New Team\nCanadiens: Hutson Was “Grounded”\nCanadiens: It Wasn’t Perfect, But It Was Enough\n\nBrendan Gallagher has made the headlines recently, but not necessarily for the right reasons, as fans and media alike have started questioning whether he’ll remain in the lineup when the injured Habs are ready to return. In this game, however, he scored an important goal, not only because it gave the Canadiens a 2-0 lead, but because it was the 243rd of his career, which means he’s now tied with Mats Naslund for the 14th most goals scored while playing for the storied franchise.\n\nChose qu'on aime réentendre: «De Danault à Gallagher»\n\nSomething we'd like to hear again: \"From Danault to Gallagher\"#GoHabsGo pic.twitter.com/ZOjwjMUhOy\n\n— Canadiens Montréal (@CanadiensMTL) January 14, 2026\n\nOf course, Gallagher needed 881 matches to reach the milestone while Nastlund only needed 617 games, but still, for a fifth-round pick to have that kind of career with the same franchise is quite a feat. Gallagher has earned everything he has done in his career, nothing was ever given to him.\n\nIf there remained any doubts about whether Samuel Montembeault was fully back, they should have been eclipsed by his performance tonight. Flawless through 40 minutes after having made 17 saves, the Canadiens’ goaltender was put through a real test in the third as we faced 16 shots. While he did allow two goals, they were both nice deflected shots from Ethan Frank, and neither can be held against the Habs’ goaltender.\n\nMontyyyyy pic.twitter.com/nyumH0lUZB\n\n— Canadiens Montréal (@CanadiensMTL) January 14, 2026\n\nMontembeault's puck tracking and rebound control were on point, and he played a calm, collected game despite mounting pressure, especially late in the game. Without his heroics, the Caps wouldn’t have needed the overtime period to seal the deal. Washington added another 10 shots in the extra frame, and the goaltender stood tall as captain Nick Suzuki was stuck in the box, but with 39 seconds left, Connor McMichael called game.\n\nSince the game was the second part of a back-to-back, the Canadiens elected to give Kaiden Guhle a night off and to bring Jayden Struble back into the lineup. While the decision makes sense from a workload management standpoint for Guhle, it meant that Noah Dobson spent 28:37 on the ice and Mike Matheson 27:54. Meanwhile, Arber Xhekaj only saw 7:03 of action, the fact that he was in the penalty box for so long after getting 17 penalty minutes didn’t help his cause much, and Jayden Struble only played 9:43 after he looked a bit worse for wear following a hit.\n\nIn his first game in 13 days, Josh Anderson did well, scoring the Canadiens’ first goal as they were on the penalty kill.\n\nUn homme en moins, un cheval en plus 🐎\n\nGood to have you back, Andy!#GoHabsGo pic.twitter.com/DycYJydkiQ\n\n— Canadiens Montréal (@CanadiensMTL) January 14, 2026\n\nWhile the Canadiens leave Washington with a point, they could definitely have used two, and sooner rather than later, they may start regretting not having many regulation wins, since it's the first tiebreaker if points are tied.\n\nFollow Karine on X @KarineHains Bluesky @karinehains.bsky.social and Threads @karinehains.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Canadiens' page for all the news and happenings around the Canadiens.\n\nJoin the discussion by signing up to the Canadiens' roundtable on The Hockey News.\n\ncom/free.

(WMBD/WYZZ) — Morton did it to Washington again.\n\nPaige Selke and Abby VanMeenen scored 12 points each as third-ranked Morton handed top-ranked Washington its first loss of the season, 41-37, in a match-up of teams at the top of the Mid-Illini Conference standings Tuesday at Morton High School. The hosts (15-3, 7-0) led by as many as 12 points in the third quarter then had to hang on as the Panthers (17-1, 7-1) rallied to close within two in the final seconds.\n\nLast year, Morton went to No. 1 Washington and ended the Panthers season-opening 21-game win streak with a 46-45 win at Torry Gym. The Panthers returned the favor by beating the Potters in the regular season finale and in the sectional championship on the way to finishing third at state.\n\nPenelope Drake scored nine points for the Potters but may have delivered the game’s biggest play when she blocked a three-point shot by Washington’s Avery Tibbs with 0:15 left as Washington was aiming to tie the game. Tibbs finished with a game-high 14 points.\n\nThe two teams will meet again on Feb. 10 in the final game of the regular season in Washington.\n\nOther girls basketball winners included Notre Dame, Richwoods, Normal Community, Normal West, Metamora, Canton. Pekin, and Illini Bluffs. Boys basketball winners Tuesday included Normal Community, Normal West, Richwoods, Manual, Washington, Leroy, Fieldcrest, El Paso-Gridley, Elmwood and Peoria Heights.",

    "fullText": "“Bodybagz” is getting the biggest opportunity of his career in “Rain City.”\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship (UFC) CEO Dana White announced today that former Middleweight champion Israel Adesanya will headline UFC Seattle against surging contender Joe Pyfer on Sat., March 28, 2026, inside Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, Washington.\n\nFor Adesanya (24-5), the bout represents a pivotal moment in his legendary career. The former champion is currently riding the longest losing streak of his time in the Octagon. In his most recent appearance, “The Last Stylebender” was knocked out by Nassourdine Imavov in the main event of UFC Saudi Arabia (watch highlights). Before that, he lost his title to Sean Strickland at UFC 293 and was later submitted by Dricus du Plessis at UFC 305 (watch highlights).\n\nDespite the recent skid, Adesanya remains one of the UFC’s most reliable headliners. UFC Seattle will mark his 12th consecutive main event appearance, and he currently sits at No. 6 in the Middleweight rankings.\n\nAcross the cage will be Pyfer (15-3), who finally gets his long-awaited step into elite company. After suffering his first UFC loss against Jack Hermansson in his first UFC main event, the Philadelphia knockout artist has rebounded in emphatic fashion.\n\nPyfer rattled off three straight victories, starting with a brutal knockout of Marc-Andre Barriault at UFC 303 (watch highlights), followed by a decision win over Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 316. Most recently, he showcased his evolving skill set by submitting Abus Magomedov at UFC 320 (watch highlights).\n\nA win over Adesanya would instantly vault Pyfer into the Middleweight Top 10.\n\nHere is what UFC Seattle currently looks like:\n\nCasey O’Neill vs. Gabriella Fernandes\n\nMarcin Tybura vs. Valter Walker\n\nNicolle Caliari vs. Carol Fiori\n\nMansur Abdul-Malik vs. Yousri Belgaroui",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Washington Commanders were hoping for big things in the 2025 NFL season.\n\nNothing went right, though, and they couldn't keep their momentum rolling from the campaign before.\n\nThey'll be looking to get a jolt for themselves in the offseason, and it may come from a trade.\n\nBleacher Report's Alex Ballentine has predicted in a new article that the Commanders could trade for Raiders pass rusher Maxx Crosby.\n\nHis projection has three picks going back from Washington to Vegas: 2026 first-round pick (No. 7 overall), 2026 fifth-round pick (No. 145 overall), 2027 first-round pick.\n\n\"History has a way of repeating itself. Back in 2018, the Raiders got a stockpile of draft picks from the Chicago Bears for a prime Khalil Mack,\" Ballentine writes. \"The Raiders might be in position to get another draft haul for a star edge-rusher.\"\n\nMIKE TOMLIN NEWS: What it means for Rodgers | TV future | Tomlin trade potential | Cignetti?\n\nIt'd be a steep price for the Commanders, but it could be worth it.\n\n\"The Commanders fit the bill,\" Ballentine writes. \"They have around $89.8 million in cap space and the potential to have a huge bounce-back season with a healthy Jayden Daniels next season. Washington's struggles this season gives them the advantage of a top-10 pick to offer to Vegas. Dan Quinn would get the marquee pass-rusher he needs to improve the Commanders defense and the Raiders would be able to potentially add a quarterback at No. 1 and a foundational defensive prospect at No. 7.\"\n\nThat big cap space is a key here.\n\nCrosby signed a three-year, $106 million contract extension before the 2025 NFL season. He'll be owed more than $40 million per year for the duration of his time conceptually in Washington.\n\nBut he'd be worth it. Crosby remains one of the best in the NFL. The Commanders could use him.\n\nPatriots, Drake Maye silence doubters with callback to Brady, Belichick\n\nA.J. Brown makes a disrespectful decision after season-ending loss\n\nIt's harder to become Steelers coach than it is to become Pope\n\nReddit proves Justin Herbert turns into Shedeur Sanders in the playoffs\n\nBills, Josh Allen never stopped pushing, and the Super Bowl dream is alive\n\nPanthers make decision on Bryce Young's future in Carolina",

Canada wants it. They ‌need it.\"\n\nThe Detroit Three are heavily reliant on supply chains that include significant parts production in Mexico and Canada and all three produce hundreds of thousands of vehicles annually in both countries.\n\nMajor automakers including Tesla, Toyota and Ford in November urged the Trump administration to extend USMCA, saying ⁠it is crucial to American auto ‌production.The automakers, which also included General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Stellantis. The American Automotive Policy Council, representing the Detroit Three automakers, said USMCA \"enables automakers ‍operating in the U.S. to compete globally through regional integration, which delivers efficiency gains\" and accounts \"for tens of billions of dollars in annual savings.\"\n\nMark Reuss, president of General Motors, said at an event Tuesday: \"Our ​supply chains go all the way through all three countries. It's not simple. It's very ‌complex,” he said. “The whole North American piece of that is a big strength.\"\n\nTrump made the comments as he toured a Ford factory in Dearborn, Michigan, ahead of a speech on the economy he is delivering in Detroit.\n\n\"The problem is we don't need their product. You know, we don't need cars made in Canada. We don't need cars made in Mexico. We want ⁠to take them here. And that's what's happening,\" he ​said.\n\nStellantis said in November that under 15% tariffs with ​Japan, U.S. vehicles complying with North American content rules \"will continue to lose market share to Asian imports, to the detriment of American automotive workers.\"\n\nThe USMCA ‍is up for review this ⁠year to decide whether it will be left to expire or another deal will be worked out.\n\nThe trade pact, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement in ⁠2020 and was negotiated during Trump's first term as president, requires the three countries to hold a joint ‌review after six years.",

    "description": "The Tennessee Titans interviewed Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator and former Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo for their open head coach position.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans conducted an interview with Steve Spagnuolo for their head coaching vacancy. Here's everything you need to know about the Titans' coaching candidate.\n\nSpagnuolo, 66, has been the Kansas City Chiefs’ defensive coordinator since 2019 and is a four-time Super Bowl champion as a coordinator. He previously served as head coach of the St. Louis Rams from 2009-11 and spent four games as interim head coach with the New York Giants in 2017. Across those four seasons, Spagnuolo posted an 11-41 record. Among coaches who’ve coached at least 50 games in the Super Bowl era, Spagnuolo’s winning percentage is the second worst, ahead of only Hue Jackson.\n\nSpagnuolo has worked with Chiefs coach Andy Reid during Reid’s tenures in Philadelphia and Kansas City. He also worked with Tom Coughlin in New York as the Giants’ defensive coordinator in 2007-08, helping the Giants to a Super Bowl win, before heading to St. Louis for his first head coaching job.\n\nSpagnuolo’s tenure in St. Louis was one of the more disastrous runs for any franchise in recent memory. The Rams went 1-15 in Spagnuolo’s first season, earning the No. 1 pick in the ensuing No. 1 draft that was used on quarterback Sam Bradford. Bradford helped turn things around for the Rams as a rookie, posting a 7-9 record. But the Rams’ fates cratered the next year. Bradford and the offense only scored 193 points all season, the fifth-worst mark of the 21st century and, to this day, the last time an NFL team scored fewer than 200 points across a full season. Spagnuolo’s defense didn’t fare all that much better, allowing the seventh-most points in the NFL and putting up a putrid performance against the run to push the squad to a 2-14 finish and Spagnuolo to his firing.\n\nSpagnuolo bounced around roles with New Orleans, Baltimore and the Giants over the next half-decade before returning to Reid’s orbit at the start of the Chiefs’ dynasty. Under Spagnuolo’s tutelage, Chiefs defenders like Chris Jones, Tyrann Mathieu and Trent McDuffie have earned first-team All-Pro nods, while contributors such as Nick Bolton, Frank Clark and Justin Reid playing at or around the peaks of their positions at various times.\n\nThough Reid’s offense gets a lot of credit for the Chiefs’ Super Bowl wins, Spagnuolo’s defense has been the propulsive force of their last couple of runs. This was especially true in 2023 when the Chiefs owned the NFL’s No. 2 scoring defense and total defense versus ranking No. 9 in total offense and No. 15 in scoring offense.\n\nSpagnuolo worked in Kansas City with Titans GM Mike Borgonzi from 2019-2024, lending some familiarity to the interview process.\n\nThe Titans fired former coach Brian Callahan in October after a 1-5 start to the 2025 season that followed a 3-14 debut year in 2024. Under interim coach Mike McCoy, the Titans finished the 2025 season with another 3-14 record and earned the No. 4 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Titans have announced completed head coach interviews with the following candidates:\n\nKevin Stefanski, former Browns HC\n\nJason Garrett, former Cowboys HC\n\nThe Titans have also scheduled interviews with or requested interviews from the following candidates: Former Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, former Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris, former Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley and San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh.\n\nNick Suss is the Titans beat writer for The Tennessean.

    "description": "The investigation, which centers on renovations of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters in Washington, signals an escalation in the long-running clash between President Trump and the chair.",
    "fullText": "The U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia has opened a criminal investigation into Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, over the central bank’s renovation of its Washington headquarters and whether Mr. Powell lied to Congress about the scope of the project, according to officials briefed on the situation.\n\nThe inquiry, which includes an analysis of Mr. Powell’s public statements and an examination of spending records, was approved in November by Jeanine Pirro, a longtime ally of President Trump who was appointed to run the office last year, the officials said.\n\nThe investigation escalates Mr. Trump’s long-running feud with Mr. Powell, whom the president has continually attacked for resisting his demands to slash interest rates significantly. The president has threatened to fire the Fed chair — even though he nominated Mr. Powell for the position in 2017 — and raised the prospect of a lawsuit against him related to the $2.5 billion renovation, citing “incompetence.”\n\nMr. Trump told The New York Times in an interview last week that he had decided on who he wants to replace Mr. Powell as Fed chair. He is expected to soon announce his decision. Kevin A. Hassett, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, is a front-runner for the top job. While Mr. Powell’s term as chair ends in May, his term as a governor runs through January 2028. Mr. Powell has not disclosed whether he plans to stay on at the central bank beyond this year.\n\nIn a rare video message released by the Fed on Sunday, Mr. Powell described the investigation as “unprecedented” and questioned the motivation for the move, even as he affirmed that he carried out his duties as chair “without political fear or favor.”\n\n“This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,” he said. “It is not about Congress’s oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts.”\n\nHe warned that the investigation signaled a broader battle over the Fed’s independence. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”\n\nA spokesman for Attorney General Pam Bondi did not comment on the investigation but said Ms. Bondi had “instructed her U.S. attorneys to prioritize investing any abuses of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s investigation into Mr. Powell underscores Mr. Trump’s larger clash with the Fed. Other broadsides have included an effort to oust Lisa D. Cook, a governor at the central bank whom Mr. Trump tried to fire over allegations of mortgage fraud. Presidents are able to remove officials at the Fed only for “cause,” which has typically meant malfeasance or a dereliction of duty. The Supreme Court will hear arguments for Ms. Cook’s case on Jan. 21.\n\nCongress granted the Fed the authority to set interest rates free of meddling from presidents, whose political fortunes are often tethered to how the economy is faring. Rather, lawmakers stipulated that the central bank should pursue low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market.\n\nMr. Powell said on Sunday that the Justice Department had served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas. Prosecutors in Ms. Pirro’s office have contacted Mr. Powell’s staff multiple times to request documents about the renovation project, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation who discussed an open inquiry on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStarting an investigation is one thing, presenting sufficient evidence to secure an indictment from a federal grand jury — or making it stick — is another.\n\nIndictments against two of Mr. Trump’s top targets, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and Letitia James, the New York attorney general, were thrown out in November by a federal judge. An investigation into Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, has yet to yield enough evidence to present to a grand jury.\n\nThe renovations at the center of the investigation into Mr. Powell broke ground in 2022 and are set to be completed in 2027. They are estimated to be about $700 million over budget. The project involves expanding and modernizing the Marriner S. Eccles Building and another building on Constitution Avenue, which date to the 1930s.\n\nThe Fed has said that neither of those buildings has been “comprehensively renovated” since their construction nearly 100 years ago, suggesting they were in need of a significant overhaul. Part of the project includes removing asbestos and lead contamination as well as making the facilities compliant with laws related to accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nA 2021 version of the Fed’s proposal described private elevators and dining rooms for top policymakers, water fountains and new marble features, in addition to a rooftop terrace for staff. Pressed at a congressional hearing in June, Mr. Powell denied that many of those features were part of the latest proposal.\n\n“There’s no V.I.P. dining room; there’s no new marble,” he said. “We took down the old marble, we’re putting it back up. We’ll have to use new marble where some of the old marble broke. But there’s no special elevators. There’s just old elevators that have been there.”\n\nMr. Powell added that the project’s plans had “continued to evolve” and that some features that had been initially incorporated were scrapped.\n\nAfter Mr. Powell’s testimony, the Fed published a “Frequently Asked Questions” post on its website that reaffirmed Mr. Powell’s answers to lawmakers. The central bank continued to share additional details, including a virtual tour as well as photographs and annotations to the 2021 proposal that prompted the criticism.\n\nIn explaining the cost overruns, the central bank cited expenses tied to materials, equipment and labor as well as unforeseen circumstances, such as more asbestos than anticipated and soil contamination.",

    "title": "Cowboys news: Former Dallas 1st-round pick weighs in on who should be next DC",
    "description": "Your Sunday morning Cowboys news.",
    "fullText": "Ex-Cowboy has a daring take of who should be their next defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are on the hunt for a new defensive coordinator after Matt Eberflus was fired less than 48 hours after the season finale loss against the New York Giants. Former Cowboys defensive end Marcus Spears has a solution that fans may like, and it makes sense.\n\nOn ESPN’s NFL Live, Marcus Spears was asked who should be the Cowboys’ next defensive coordinator, and he didn’t hesitate to name former Atlanta Falcons head coach Raheem Morris. Spears pointed to Morris’ history of developing defensive backs, and Morris has already emerged as a popular candidate to help fix one of the NFL’s worst defenses in 2025.\n\n“Coverage is a big thing for Raheem, and if you notice, every place that he’s been, defensive coordinator-wise or head coach, he’s always had a star corner,” Spears said. “That’s just what he believes in.”\n\nMarcus Spears advocates for Raheem Morris to be Cowboys’ next defensive coordinator\n\nMorris has had defensive success everywhere he’s been for more than two decades. He was the defensive quality control coach during the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Super Bowl run back in the 2002 season, where he coached Hall of Fame secondary players like John Lynch, Ronde Barber and Super Bowl 37 MVP, Dexter Jackson.\n\nMorris was also the defensive coordinator for the Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams back in the 2021 season. It helped to have a monster like Aaron Donald controlling the line of scrimmage, but it’s no coincidence that Morris has been a part of multiple Super Bowl defenses.\n\nGeorge Pickens gets a just reward.\n\nIn his first season with the Cowboys, wide receiver George Pickens wasn’t just trying to benefit from having a fresh start, but was eyeing a big season in his “contract year” knowing he’d be a free agent in March. Not only did Pickens produce his best season with career-highs in every major category, but now he can add All-Pro to his list of accomplishments, that also saw him make his first Pro Bowl. Pickens is one of three Cowboys to earn second-team All-Pro honors by The Associated Press (AP). The list was announced on Saturday and also included a pair of special teams standouts.\n\nKicker Brandon Aubrey and return specialist KaVontae Turpin were also second-team All-Pros. Pickens was behind first-seamers Puka Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Ja’Marr Chase. Aubrey was on the second-team behind Vikings kicker Will Reichard and Turpin finished behind Buffalo’s Ray Davis.\n\nThis is the second year in a row the Cowboys landed a receiver, kicker and returner on the AP All-Pro teams. Last year, CeeDee Lamb and Turpin were first-teamers and Aubrey made the second-team. For Aubrey, he’s been selected on the All-Pro squad in each of his first three seasons in the NFL. In 2023, he was a first-team selection.\n\nAubrey was 36-of-42 on field goals, with all six misses occurring from 50 yards or more. He did make a 64-yard field goal as time expired in regulation, sending a Week 2 game vs. the Giants to overtime. Aubrey then became the first kicker in NFL history to make field goals to end regulation and overtime, helping Dallas to a 40-37 win.\n\nCould Quinnen’s brother make a good add?\n\nEvery offseason it seems like I see a linebacker’s name pop up that the Cowboys need to get to help the defense. This year it may be Quincy Williams. Could he be the guy the middle of the defense is missing? I’ve seen some reactions, and when you dig into the type of player he is the coverage numbers may make you second guess. And honestly, I get it because it doesn’t look pretty. When you actually dig into how Quincy Williams plays, and how he is used, the conversation changes fast. So let’s talk it through like fans, not scouts trying to sound smart.\n\nThe First Thing You Need to Know: This Dude Lives in the Box\n\nQuincy Williams is not a coverage linebacker, and he never has been. He will not be floating around in space trying to run with slot receivers or carry tight ends down the seams. When you look at the snap data, it’s not even debatable. He spent hundreds of snaps in the box, very few on the edge, only a handful in the slot, and almost none on the outside.\n\nThat tells you exactly how defenses should play him.  He is there to attack downhill. If you judge this man based on coverage stats alone, you’re grading a fish on how well it climbs trees. How Quincy Williams Actually Plays\n\nWhat I like about Quincy Williams is simple: when he sees it, he goes. There’s no dancing, no waiting for someone else to make the play. He triggers fast and shows up with bad intentions. Is he perfect? Absolutely not, but were any of the Cowboys linebackers last season even above average.\n\nHe will miss a tackle here and there because of his aggressive play style, but I’ll take that every day over a linebacker who catches blocks and gets pancaked. What I found even more impressive was he lines up all over the box. He can play weak side, strong side, and take inside looks, but he rarely just sat in the middle calling things out. He’s a flow-and-hunt guy, so the Cowboys would need to let him scrape, chase, and hit. That is where his game makes sense.\n\nThis may be another area where people will get twisted.  Yes, you will see him walked up near the line sometimes, but he’s not an edge rusher.  He is not winning with moves or stacking sacks. Those snaps are about pressure and confusion to make the offense account for him, mess with protection calls, and let the defense work around it. He’s a blitzer, not a technician, and if used incorrectly, it looks ugly.\n\n“My goal in life is to retire as the owner that won the most Super Bowls,” Jones said with complete seriousness. “That’s my goal.” Not just to win another one. Nope. To have the most of any owner in history. It was actually a shocking admission, given the recent state of the franchise. Jones obviously got off to a blistering start toward that achievement, winning three Lombardi Trophies in his first seven years of ownership, which was a literal lifetime ago.\n\nIt’s been 30 years since he added to that total. Only 10 of the players who finished the season with Dallas were even alive when Jones last won the big one. But now, at 83 years old, he wants to get serious about stockpiling? “How many more do I have to go as a single owner?” he asked the room. [New England’s] Bob [Kraft]’s got how many, six? I’ve got work to do.”\n\nTo be fair, Jones does seem, by all outward appearances, to be in fairly good health. But to suggest that he’s going to keep running the organization he’s always run it… and suddenly do something that hasn’t happened since the original Toy Story was still playing in movie theaters… and then do it THREE MORE TIMES in awfully quick succession seems too pie-in-the-sky for even the most wildly delusional Cowboys fan.\n\nQuite frankly, one more trophy would be a staggeringly earth-shaking development for this franchise under its current power structure. The only thing crazier than Jones coming right out and saying he plans to win four more championships before he “retires” is the fact that it was only the third-craziest thing he said during Wednesday’s press conference.",

    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals requested an interview with San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh earlier in the week.\n\nWe’re going to go out on a limb and say that Saleh won’t take the chance in his second head coaching stint in the NFC West, where three of the best coaches in the NFL reside. Not to mention, the Cardinals have had three total wins in the division during the past three seasons—just a hunch.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Baltimore Ravens requested Saleh for their head coaching vacancy after firing John Harbaugh after 18 seasons.\n\nIn December, it was reported that Saleh would be patient and not jump at the opportunity to coach again if it wasn’t a fit. On Thursday, Saleh was asked about his focus on the playoffs with the NFL coaching openings. Saleh said, “The league has done a nice job structuring the interview process, allowing focus on the job at hand. Haven’t thought about it. I know things come in but don’t have to deal with it until next week.”\n\nThe Ravens’ job has to be intriguing for anybody. They have one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL when healthy, and play in a division that pales in comparison to the NFC West. Baltimore also has building blocks, like Kyle Hamilton, and has generally a playoff team since Lamar Jackson took over as the starter.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the Atlanta Falcons and Tennessee Titans also requested an interview for Saleh. So, he’s once again a popular candidate during this coaching cycle.\n\nKyle’s update, 9:56 a.m. PT: NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported the Miami Dolphins put in a request to interview 49ers’ DC Robert Saleh, making it his fifth interview during this cycle. He’s close to interviewing for every head coaching vacancy. The Dolphins going from the former Niners offensive coordinator to their defensive coordinator would be entertaining.",

    "fullText": "Following the publication of a report in The New York Times on Friday night revealing that the Washington National Opera will be leaving the Kennedy Center, members of the Trump administration immediately began scrambling to reframe the news as not only a positive, but their idea.\n\nKennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi, who has been hard at work lashing out at artists for canceling scheduled performances at the once-revered venue, posted a statement to X claiming that the center’s relationship with the opera group has “presented ongoing financial challenges for well over a decade” that “long predate the current leadership.”\n\n“Given the longstanding financial strain, it has become necessary for us to part ways to protect the best interests of the Center,” Daravi wrote.\n\nThe statement was then amplified by the venue’s Donald Trump-appointed executive director Richard Grenell, who elaborated on the difficulties surrounding exclusivity agreements.\n\n“Having an exclusive relationship has been extremely expensive and limiting in choice and variety,” Grenell wrote on X. “We approached the Opera leadership last year with this idea and they began to be open to it.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, he wrote, “The exclusive Opera contract cost the Trump Kennedy Center $64 million over the last 10 years—with their expenses being double their revenues.”\n\n“We were very pleased that the current Opera leadership was so willing to end their exclusivity,” he noted.\n\nThe New York Times report states that the decision to sever ties was made by the Washington National Opera, with the board of trustees approving a resolution on Friday that will enable the group to terminate its agreement with the venue.\n\n“Today, the Washington National Opera announced its decision to seek an amicable early termination of its affiliation agreement with the Kennedy Center and resume operations as a fully independent nonprofit entity,” a statement provided to The New York Times said.\n\nOpera officials told the paper that new venues in Washington D.C. have been lined up but that no leases have been signed. They declined to name specific venues.\n\nWith the passing of the resolution, the WNO will now seek to move its performances out of the center’s opera house and reduce the number of performances staged there.\n\nThe decision marks the end of a partnership between the Kennedy Center and the WNO that dates back to 1971.\n\nWhile the WNO did not mention the Kennedy Center’s MAGA rebrand as the reason for its departure, they have noted disagreements with new requirements that have been made under the cultural center’s new management.\n\nSeveral well-known performers have canceled planned events since President Donald Trump’s takeover of the center, which saw him fire the board in order to populate it with his allies and install himself as chair.\n\nTrump further ignited tensions when he attempted to rebrand the center to bear his name, ignoring the fact that any formal change requires congressional action. A lawsuit was filed shortly after, challenging the rebrand.\n\nIn response to Trump’s actions, several artists have canceled planned appearances at the performing arts venue, including comedian Issa Rae, folk act Rhiannon Giddens, musician Kristy Lee, trumpeter Wayne Tucker, and Grammy-winning bluegrass performer Béla Fleck.\n\nOn Thursday, singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos canceled her Feb. 7 performance at the Kennedy Center, citing her Mexican heritage and the Trump administration’s immigration policies as the reasons behind her decision.\n\n“As an artist, I treasure the freedom to create and share my music, and for many years I have used this privilege to uplift the stories of immigrants in this country,” the Grammy-nominated musician wrote on Thursday. “Unfortunately, I do not feel that the current climate at this beloved venue represents a welcoming space for myself, my band, or our audience.”",

Ohio State, which was picked to finish ninth in a preseason conference media poll, averaged a 25-point margin of victory during a six-game winning streak earlier this season.\n\nThe Huskies (1-3 Big Ten, 9-6 overall) are starting a tough three-game homestand against the Midwestern stalwarts of the Big Ten. After Ohio State, Washington will welcome No. 2 Michigan and No. 12 Michigan State next week.\n\nWashington leads 8-5 over Ohio State in the series, including a 6-0 record in Seattle.\n\nMore information below on Ohio State and Washington and how to watch the game.\n\nThe Buckeyes feature an efficient offense that ranks in the top 25 nationally in field goal percentage (50.6) and is fifth in the Big Ten at 84.6 points per game. Ohio State also makes 78.4% of its free throws (eighth in the country) but struggles from distance, converting only 34.3% of its 3-pointers.\n\nIn the win over Oregon, all five starters scored in double figures. Devin Royal and Christoph Tilly each had 14 points, senior leader Bruce Thornton had 12, John Mobley Jr. added 13, and Amare Bynum chipped in with 10.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 running back room could feature a new face from the transfer portal, and while Baylor transfer back Bryson Washington made his way to College Station this weekend, Washington is now in the mix for the Texas native, which have have made a significant push this week. However, this doesn't rule out the Aggies landing a transfer running back, as a new name has emerged.\n\nAccording to AggieYell insider Jaxson Callaway, Texas A&M is now targeting Michigan State transfer running back Makhi Frazier, who is reportedly coming off a Friday visit to Ohio State. While this may seem daunting, the Aggies have won multiple transfer battles against the Buckeyes this month. Still, adding another running back isn't A&M's top priority compared to other programs.\n\nWashington is still the No. 1 running back target for head coach Mike Elko and his staff, and Callaway is right to state that the rest of the RB portal market will depend on Washington's choice regarding which way the Huskies will go.\n\n\"At the moment, much of the running back market appears to be waiting on Washington’s decision.\"\n\nFocusing on Frazier, the McKinney, Texas native is listed at 5'10\" and nearly 220 pounds, and is coming off an impressive 2025 sophomore campaign after rushing for 520 yards and two touchdowns, averaging 4.5 yards per carry.\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Frazier earned a solid offensive grade (74.8) and a rushing grade (77.6), which bodes well for his future as a potential starting or No. 2 running back. Frazier will continue to be a name to watch, but until Bryson Washington makes his decision, both players will be the top backs on the Aggies' radar.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Transfer RB Makhi Frazier has emerged as a Texas A&M target",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — For House Republicans, the political year started with a pep rally of sorts as President Donald Trump gathered them at Washington's Kennedy Center for a stemwinder of a speech. But by the time lawmakers had completed their first week of work this midterm election year, fractures in the party were already showing.\n\nFrom pushback to Trump's self-described “Donroe doctrine” of aggression in the Western Hemisphere to breaks in party unity over health care, Republican lawmakers are displaying signs of independence from Trump after spending much of the last year acquiescing to his practically every demand. It showed a new dynamic in the GOP as Republicans embark on difficult campaign to keep control of both the House and Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, speaking at the U.S.-Mexico border Friday with a group of Republican Senate candidates, said that Republicans were “going to be focused like a laser” on issues of affordability and pointed to legislation in the works on housing and health care.\n\nThune's border trip and talk of affordability were a nod back to some of the core themes of Trump's presidential campaign. But the focus in Washington of late has instead been dominated by Trump's military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, his threats to use military force to take control of Greenland, the release of case files on Jeffrey Epstein and a debate over extending subsidies for insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act — an issue where Republicans have long struggled to find unity.\n\nRecent shootings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in several U.S. cities, including one that killed a woman in Minneapolis, have also raised new questions about Republicans' hard-line immigration agenda and shifted attention away from Trump's handling of the border, which they see as a political success.\n\nEven so, Trump still has plenty of command over most of the party. That was demonstrated this week by a pair of unsuccessful House veto override votes in which most GOP members stuck with the president despite previously voting for the low-profile bills.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few Republicans to consistently defy Trump, said that “there was some bully pulpit intimidation going on” from the president that caused the veto overrides to fail.\n\nStill, Democrats are making the case that Trump is becoming distracted from the needs of Americans, especially after the attack on Venezuela.\n\n“He's lurching towards another endless, expensive war, all the while American families here are struggling with skyrocketing costs,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nVenezuela war powers vote draws GOP support\n\nTo prove their point, Democrats are forcing votes on war powers resolutions that would stop Trump from attacking Venezuela without congressional approval. Such measures are rarely successful, but a procedural vote on the legislation drew support from five Republicans Thursday, setting up a final vote next week. House Democrats are also pushing forward a similar resolution.\n\nThe GOP senators who voted for the legislation tried to defuse the conflict with Trump by arguing their positions were in line with his own campaign promises to scale back U.S. commitments overseas.\n\n“A drawn-out campaign in Venezuela involving the American military, even if unintended, would be the opposite of President Trump’s goal of ending foreign entanglements,” Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who voted for the war powers resolution, said in a lengthy statement explaining his vote.\n\nTrump reacted with fury. The president promptly called for the five Republicans, which included Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who is up for reelection this year, to “never be elected to office again.”\n\nRepublicans are already dealing with retirements from several lawmakers who had uneasy relationships with Trump, and there was worry that such clashes could complicate their campaign picture even more.\n\n“If Susan isn’t the senator from Maine, we’re going to end up with a Democrat,” said Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican. “That would be 10 times worse. But I do appreciate that President Trump is absolutely pissed off.”\n\nGOP pushes back on Trump's Greenland plans\n\nTrump's desire to possess Greenland and his administration's decision not to rule out military force also met significant resistance from GOP lawmakers this week.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who is retiring after crossing Trump last summer, took to the Senate floor to proclaim that he was “sick of stupid.” He specifically criticized White House deputy chief of policy Stephen Miller, who made comments that Greenland should be part of the U.S.\n\n“I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy,” Tillis added. “And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”\n\nOther Republicans, including Thune and Senate Armed Services Committee chair Sen. Roger Wicker, also gently pushed back on military threats against Denmark, which is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nAfter meeting with the Danish ambassador, Wicker said it was Denmark's right not to sell Greenland.\n\n“I’m troubled by Greenland. I'm troubled by some of the things he does. I don’t get it,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, another retiring Republican. “I do feel like Congress should be more independent and should provide checks and balances here.”\n\nBacon added that Trump still had the ability to “bully” his Republican colleagues, but that Trump's threats had “stiffened my spine.”\n\nHealth care votes expose divisions\n\nDuring Trump's speech at the Kennedy Center on Tuesday, he urged Republicans to own the issue of health care. Yet when the House voted Thursday on a Democratic proposal to extend expired health care subsidies for Affordable Care Act health plans, 17 Republicans broke with party leadership to help pass the bill.\n\n“People recognize the challenge here, which is to address health care affordability,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who voted for the proposal.\n\nHe still criticized the Affordable Care Act, a hallmark piece of legislation for Democrats, yet the health care debate unfolding in Congress is one that Democrats feel confident making a central campaign issue.\n\n“In this first, full week of the new year, House Democrats — every single one of us joined by 17 Republicans — have partnered in a bipartisan way to protect the health care of the American people,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries following the vote.\n\nJan. 6 plaque coming out of storage\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, Trump told House Republicans that he had told his supporters to go “peacefully and patriotically” to confront Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election. The White House also unveiled a website that portrayed the Jan. 6 attack as a “witch hunt” against him by Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut the Senate, which Republicans control, this week agreed to display a plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol — a cause that has become a point of contention with Trump as president. The plaque had been kept in storage rather than being displayed because House Speaker Mike Johnson had said the memorial did not comply with the law.\n\nIt was Tillis again who pushed the issue on the Republican side. He said it was important to honor the police and staff who risked their own lives and safety that day.\n\nDemocrats who joined in the effort said they were alarmed by the White House's attempt to recast the narrative.\n\n“It's so important we be honest with the American people about what happened,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.\n\nThis story has corrected the party affiliation of Rep. Mike Lawler. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.",

    "fullText": "Trae Young reveals why he wanted to be traded to Wizards originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStar guard Trae Young raised some eyebrows when it was reported that his preferred trade destination was the Washington Wizards. Players don’t typically want to get traded to Washington. If anything, the opposite is usually the case.\n\nBut, Young wanted the Wizards, and he ultimately got his wish, as the Atlanta Hawks relocated him to Washington earlier this week.\n\nDuring his introductory press conference with the Wizards, Young explained what it was about Washington that was attractive to him.\n\n“I’m just super excited. For me, D.C. is overlooked as far as a big market. In the NBA, I feel like this is a big market,” Young said. “I just feel like I’m coming into an opportunity to be myself. I’m around people that obviously have known me for a long time and know the type of person I am and the type of winner I want to be.\n\n“And I know it's a day-by-day process. I know what it takes. It's not going to be easy. But I know this is a place that I'm excited about and I was excited about whenever I heard it could be a possibility.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen when Young when make his debut for the Wizards. He's dealing with a sprained knee and a quad bruise and hasn't appeared in a game since Dec. 27.\n\nWhen he does return, he’ll be sporting a different number. Young wore No. 11 during his time in Atlanta, but that number is retired in Washington, so he was forced to switch to No. 3.\n\nIt also remains to be seen how long Trae’s tenure in Washington will last. The four-time All-Star has a player option in his contract for next season, which he could turn down in favor of unrestricted free agency. Though, one would assume that the Wizards traded for Young with the intension of inking him to an extension.\n\nThe expectation around the league is that Young will indeed sign an extension with Washington, per ESPN, but it remains to be seen when that might happen.\n\nNBA legend blasts Hawks over Trae Young trade, labels them a 'mid' franchise\n\nLuka Doncic reacts to Trae Young trade to Washington Wizards\n\nCJ McCollum reacts to being traded to Atlanta Hawks for Trae Young",

    "fullText": "The Cowboys are set to begin interviews for their defensive coordinator opening. Just 72 hours after the firing of Matt Eberflus, the team will kick off the conversations to find his replacement with three meetings reportedly over the next two days.\n\nPer NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, the Cowboys will interview Vikings assistant Daronte Jones and Browns assistant Ephraim Banda on Friday, with Broncos assistant Jim Leonhard rounding out the current slate on Saturday.\n\nThe Cowboys had hoped to also speak with Falcons assistant Jeff Ulbrich but was denied permission, as Atlanta reportedly hopes to keep him on staff to serve under their next as-yet-unnamed head coach.\n\n#Cowboys will conduct their 1st round of defensive coordinator interviews today, speaking with #Vikings defensive pass game coordinator Daronte Jones and #Browns safeties coach Ephraim Banda, then they'll speak with #Broncos defensive pass game coordinator Jim Leonhard tomorrow.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 9, 2026\n\nHead coach Brian Schottenheimer said earlier in the week that the process of evaluating their current coaching staff could take \"10 to 12 days,\" but announced a parting of the ways with Eberflus the following day, after a historically poor season that saw the Dallas defense give up a franchise-worst 30 points per game.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones explained in the team's season-ending press conference that neither prior head coaching nor coordinator experience at the pro level would be considered a prerequisite for the current DC job; none of the current candidates have either.\n\nHere's a quick look at the first three interviewees for the role.\n\nJones has been Minnesota's defensive pass game coordinator since 2023 and was the Vikings' defensive backs coach in 2022 and also in 2020 (with a year as LSU's defensive coordinator in between). The 47-year-old is thought to bring a lot of the qualities that the team likes in current Vikings DC Brian Flores. The Jets have also requested permission to interview Jones for their DC job.\n\nBanda, 44, has coached the Browns' safeties since 2023, hired to the job by current defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz. Despite the team's 5-12 record this season, Banda safeties Grant Delpit and Ronnie Hickman helped the team put up top-three numbers in passing yards allowed. Prior to Cleveland, Banda spent a dozen years in the college ranks; he worked defensive quality control at Mississippi State in 2015, Dak Prescott's senior year.\n\nLeonhard is considered by many to be a rising star in the coaching world. After 10 years as an NFL safety, he went back to his alma mater of Wisconsin to begin his coaching career and then returned to Denver (where he played in 2012) to be the Broncos' defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator in 2024. Last year, the 43-year-old added assistant head coach to his job duties. Leonhard has history with Brian Schottenheimer; he was a Jet for three years while Schottenheimer was offensive coordinator there.\n\nTodd is on X at @ToddBrock24f7.

    "description": "Lebanon's military said Thursday it had concluded the first phase of a plan to fully deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, notably Hezbollah.

The effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024.",
    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon's military said Thursday it had concluded the first phase of a plan to fully deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, notably Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael said the development was encouraging but “far from sufficient,\" and its Foreign Ministry said the group still has dozens of compounds and other infrastructure.\n\nThe effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024.\n\nThe military's statement, which did not name Hezbollah or any other armed groups, came before President Joseph Aoun met with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and his government to discuss the deployment and disarmament plans. Both said disarming non-state groups was a priority upon beginning their terms not long after the ceasefire went into effect.\n\nLebanon's top officials have endorsed the military announcement.\n\nA statement by Aoun’s office ahead of the Cabinet meeting called on Israel to stop its attacks, withdraw from areas it occupies, and release Lebanese prisoners. He called on friendly countries not to send weapons to Lebanon unless it's to state institutions — an apparent reference to Iran which for decades has sent weapons and munitions to Hezbollah.\n\nSpeaker Nabih Berri, a key ally of Hezbollah who played a leading role in ceasefire talks, issued a statement saying the people of southern Lebanon are “thirsty for the army's presence and protection.\"\n\nIsrael maintains that despite Lebanon’s efforts, Hezbollah is still attempting to rearm itself in southern Lebanon.\n\n“The ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States between Israel and Lebanon states clearly, Hezbollah must be fully disarmed,\" a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office read. “This is imperative for Israel’s security and Lebanon’s future.”\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry said in a later statement that the group is “rearming faster than it is being disarmed,\" and showed a map of alleged Hezbollah compounds, launch sites, and underground networks south of the Litani River.\n\nPlan to restrict weapons at an ‘advanced stage’\n\nThe text of the ceasefire agreement is vague as to how Hezbollah’s weapons and military facilities north of the Litani River should be treated, saying Lebanese authorities should dismantle unauthorized facilities starting with the area south of the river.\n\nHezbollah insists that the agreement only applies south of the Litani, while Israel maintains that it applies to the whole country. The Lebanese government has said it will eventually remove non-state weapons throughout the country.\n\nThe agreement is seen as a procedure to implement prior United Nations Security Council agreements that call for disarmament of non-state groups and the withdrawal of all occupying forces, and for the Lebanese state to have full control of its territory.\n\nInformation Minister Paul Morcos said after the Cabinet meeting that the army will start working on a plan for disarmament north of the Litani river that will be discussed by the government in February. He added that the army will also continue the process of weapons “containment” in other parts of Lebanon, meaning that they will not be allowed to be used or moved.\n\nThe Lebanese military has been clearing tunnels, rocket-launching positions, and other structures since its disarmament proposal was approved by the government and went into effect in September.\n\nThe government had set a deadline of the end of 2025 to clear the area south of the Litani River of non-state weapons.\n\n“The army confirms that its plan to restrict weapons has entered an advanced stage, after achieving the goals of the first phase effectively and tangibly on the ground,” the military statement read. “Work in the sector is ongoing until the unexploded ordnance and tunnels are cleared ... with the aim of preventing armed groups from irreversibly rebuilding their capabilities.”\n\nHezbollah did not immediately comment on the Lebanese announcement.\n\nOfficials have said the next stage of the disarmament plan is in segments of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which include Lebanon’s port city of Sidon, but they have not set a timeline for that phase.\n\nIsrael continues to strike Lebanon near daily and occupies five strategic hilltop points along the border, the only areas south of the Litani where the military said it has yet to control.\n\nRegular meetings have taken place between the Lebanese and the Israelis alongside the United States, France, and the U.N. peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, to monitor developments after the ceasefire.\n\nLebanon’s cash-strapped military has since been gradually dispersing across wide areas of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the U.N.-demarcated “Blue Line” that separates the tiny country from Israel. The military has also been slowly confiscating weapons from armed Palestinian factions in refugee camps.\n\nIsrael accuses Hezbollah of trying to rebuild its battered military capacity and has said that the Lebanese military’s efforts are not sufficient, raising fears of a new escalation. Lebanon, meanwhile, said Israel's strikes and control of the hilltops were an obstacle to the efforts.\n\nLebanon also hopes that disarming Hezbollah and other non-state groups will help to bring in money needed for reconstruction after the 2024 war.\n\nHezbollah says it has been cooperative with the army in the south but will not discuss disarming elsewhere before Israel stops its strikes and withdraws from Lebanese territory.\n\nThe latest Israel-Hezbollah conflict began the day after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel triggered the war in Gaza. The militant group Hezbollah, largely based in southern Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024. Israeli strikes killed much of Hezbollah's senior leadership and left the group severely weakened.\n\nHezbollah still has political clout, holding a large number of seats in parliament representing the Shiite Muslim community and two cabinet ministers.",

    "fullText": "Demond Williams transfer portal controversy, explained: Why Washington is blocking QB from leaving recent contract originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWashington Huskies quarterback Demond Williams, coming off a 31-total-touchdown season in the Big Ten as a sophomore, announced Tuesday that he would be entering the transfer portal.\n\nIn 2026, that's almost become the norm for big-name college quarterbacks. Plenty of star passers, from Dylan Raiola to DJ Lagway, made exits from their schools this college football offseason. But in Williams' case, his announced decision sparked controversy.\n\nJust days before Williams' transfer announcement, he had reportedly agreed to return to the Huskies for the 2026 season, signing a contract to do so. And in response to his attempted exit, Washington is \"prepared to pursue all legal avenues\" if Williams is not living up to that deal.\n\nHere's everything to know about Demond Williams' transfer portal controversy.\n\nMORE:Tracking the QBs on the move in the transfer portal\n\nWilliams, who spent the first two seasons of his career at Washington and excelled as a sophomore starter in 2025, shared an Instagram post on Tuesday announcing he'd be entering the transfer portal.\n\n\"I have to do what is best for me and my future,\" he wrote. \"After much thought and prayer, I will be entering the transfer portal.\"\n\nThe problem, however, was that Williams had already signed a contract to return to the Huskies last week, per ESPN's Pete Thamel. The deal was reportedly considered \"top of the market,\" and Thamel also added that Williams entered the portal with a \"do not contact\" tag, meaning he likely already had a destination in mind.\n\nAccording to Thamel, Washington is now \"prepared to pursue all legal avenues to enforce Williams' signed contract,\" and the quarterback's situation has also \"drawn the attention of the Big Ten.\"\n\nRoss Dellenger also reported that Washington officials \"suspect\" that another school contacted Williams after he had already signed his Huskies deal. In response, Washington reportedly plans to submit evidence of tampering. On Wednesday, Dellenger added that Big Ten commissioner Tony Pelitti has become \"heavily involved in the matter.\"\n\nAccording to Matt Zenitz, LSU, which is still eyeing a quarterback after landing Lane Kiffin, is expected to be the \"team to watch\" for Williams if he's able to transfer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pete Nakos reported that Washington has no plans to enter Williams' name in the transfer portal due to his signed contract. The Big Ten is \"standing behind UW's fervent approach to the contract,\" per Dellenger.\n\nWashington officials are expected to meet Wednesday with Williams' representatives, and because the Huskies are refusing to enter Williams' name into the portal, he cannot hold conversations with other teams, per Dellenger.\n\nOn Thursday, Williams' agent, Doug Hendrickson, announced that he was dropping Williams as a client due to \"philosophical differences.\"\n\n— Doug Hendrickson (@DHendrickson41) January 8, 2026\n\nMORE: How Lane Kiffin's transfer portal acquisitions at LSU have started roughly\n\nDemond Williams had reportedly agreed to a deal with Washington days before he announced he would be entering the transfer portal.\n\nAn update thread on the Demond Williams situation with Washington, per sources to @YahooSports:\n- Williams signed a one-year rev-share agreement with UW worth about $4M.\n- The agreement is a Big Ten template document used by all league members and built for situations like this.\n\n— Ross Dellenger (@RossDellenger) January 7, 2026\n\nPete Thamel reported that the contract had been \"top of the market,\" while Ross Dellenger reported that Washington officials described the contract as \"a legally binding revenue-share contract with the school.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Ross Dellenger provided further details about the contract. It was a one-year revenue-share agreement with Washington worth about $4 million, per Dellenger. The agreement \"prohibits a player from entering the portal once signed\" and \"prohibits the player’s NIL rights to be used by any other school, though the player can sign outside marketing agreements.\"\n\nThamel also added that the buyout of Williams' contact reads the cost of the buyout is in the “sole discretion” of Washington, and it specifically states that “the institution is not obligated to enter the Student-Athlete into the transfer portal or otherwise assist or facilitate the Student-Athlete’s transfer to another college or university.”\n\nHere's a look at Williams' numbers through two seasons at Washington.\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal",

    "fullText": "As Demond Williams Jr. looks to leave Washington, his agent said Thursday that he’s no longer representing the Huskies’ QB.\n\nDoug Hendrickson said in a social media post that he had “made the decision to end my representation of Demond Williams Jr. effective immediately due to philosophical differences.” Hendrickson, who is part of the Wasserman Football agency, said that he wished “him and his family the best in their future endeavors.”\n\nHendrickson is also the agent for Washington coach Jedd Fisch.\n\nYahoo Sports’ Ross Dellenger reported Wednesday that Williams had signed a one-year deal with Washington for the 2026 season that was worth approximately $4 million. Per that agreement, the school can prohibit Williams from entering the portal after the deal is signed and the deal also forbids another school to use the player’s NIL rights.\n\nSince Williams hasn’t been officially entered into the transfer portal, NCAA rules prohibit him from talking to other schools. However, coaches across the country have been speaking out against tampering for months. And it’s hard to believe that many — if any — coaches who have publicly complained about tampering haven’t at least indirectly engaged it in themselves.\n\n- UW officials suspect that Williams has already held conversations with other programs and the school plans to submit any tampering evidence to the league and NCAA.\n- LSU is believed to be the school most interested in Williams.\n\n— Ross Dellenger (@RossDellenger) January 7, 2026\n\nLSU has been mentioned heavily as a school with interest in Williams. Lane Kiffin is searching for a transfer quarterback ahead of the 2026 season as Cincinnati’s Brendan Sorsby committed to Texas Tech and current Ole Miss QB Trinidad Chambliss is set to stay with the Rebels if the NCAA will grant him a sixth year of eligibility.\n\nWilliams would immediately become the best available QB if and when he enters the transfer portal. He was 246-of-354 passing for 3,065 yards and 25 TDs across 13 games while also rushing 143 times for 611 yards and six scores.",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA -- Injuries and health issues have defined the Philadelphia 76ers for the better part of two years now. The Sixers were expected to contend for a championship in 2024-25 after bringing in Paul George, but they went 24-58 as injuries decimated the roster.\n\nEven though they have been winning in 2025-26, the Sixers have still been snake-bitten a bit as players have been in and out of the lineup. Philadelphia has just not been able to find any type of rhythm or consistency in terms of their lineups.\n\nHowever, in Wednesday's 131-110 win over the Washington Wizards, the Sixers had their full complement of players since Dec. 18, 2023. Joel Embiid, Kelly Oubre Jr., and Trendon Watford were all available for the Sixers after initially being listed as questionable and then upgraded to probable.\n\n\"It's good,\" Embiid said. \"Just gotta keep on going, but like I said, it's all about being smart, and do it the right way, but, you know, I guess good accomplishment, but it's just got to be consistent, which we've been.\"\n\nNo Sixers are unavailable for tonight's game because of injury or personal reasons.\n\nPer my notes, this is the first time that has happened since 12/18/23.\n\nTonight will be the 11th time Nick Nurse has coached a fully healthy version of Sixers. It is his 199th game with the team.\n\n— Adam Aaronson (@SixersAdam) January 7, 2026\n\nEmbiid had 28 points, seven rebounds, and two blocks in 25 minutes. This comes after he played 40 minutes against the Denver Nuggets on Monday. The big fella is continuing to string games together and it's all great things for him and the Sixers to continue building on as time moves forward.\n\n\"I feel good,\" Embiid stated. \"Pretty good. Just gotta keep it going. I thought, tonight, I was OK tonight, so that's a good sign. Like I said, just gotta keep going. We’re still building myself back up. You just have to be smart.\"\n\nThe Sixers will begin a 3-game road trip on Friday when they take on the Orlando Magic and then head up to Toronto for a back-to-back with the Raptors. It will be interesting to see how Embiid is handled in terms of his minutes and which game he plays in against the Raptors.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Joel Embiid reacts to Sixers finally being fully healthy vs. Wizards",

    "fullText": "Coaches for teams in the wild card round won't be available for head coaching interviews until next week and one of the assistants who is seen as likely to see some interest is Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula.\n\nShula is in his second year as a coordinator and he's been with the Rams since 2017. Being a Sean McVay assistant is generally a good path to a head coaching job and Shula adds to that by being McVay's college roommate as well as the grandson of the legendary Don Shula.\n\nOn Wednesday, Shula said he took time during the summer and the team's bye week to prepare for potential head coaching interviews. That's allowed him to be \"locked in on that routine\" ahead of this week's game against the Panthers while waiting to see \"if the right situation presents itself\" in this cycle.\n\n“I think that’s the goal of any coach that wants to be in this league,” Shula said, via Greg Beachum of the Associated Press. “That doesn’t mean you’re just going to walk away for any opportunity. I love it here, and my family loves it here. We’ve been here nine, 10 years, coaching with my best friend. We obviously have a great group of players and a great staff. So for the right opportunity, we’ll see.”\n\nThe Rams defense was part of the reason for the 3-3 finish that ended their hopes of taking the top seed in the NFC, but a rebound in Carolina would put them right where they want to be and it wouldn't do anything to hurt Shula's chances of making the next step up the coaching ladder.",

Early in the second period, Canadian Olympic defenseman Thomas Harley made the play to set up Sam Steel’s net-front tap-in past Thompson\n\nSteel assisted on Wyatt Johnston’s goal, his 24th of the season, with 6:29 left in regulation.

    "fullText": "New details have emerged surrounding Demond Williams and his attempt to enter the transfer portal, shedding light on why Washington officials are refusing to process his request.\n\nAccording to Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports, Williams recently signed a one-year revenue-sharing agreement with the Huskies worth approximately $4 million. The agreement is a Big Ten–approved template used by all conference members and was specifically designed to address scenarios like this.\n\nThe contract evidently prohibits Williams from entering the transfer portal once signed, and restricts his NIL rights from being used by another school. He’s still allowed to pursue outside marketing deals per Dellenger.\n\nAs a result, Washington has declined to enter Williams’ name into the portal, which prevents him from holding conversations with other programs. Dellenger reported that Big Ten Conference commissioner Tony Petitti is heavily involved in the matter, along with other league officials.\n\nAdditionally, the conference is backing Washington’s firm stance. Coincidentally, Petitti is in Seattle this week for a memorial service while discussions continue.\n\nMoreover, Washington officials are expected to communicate later Tuesday with Williams’ representatives regarding next steps. The school also suspects Williams has already spoken with other programs and plans to submit any evidence of tampering to both the conference and the NCAA. LSU is believed to be the program most interested in Williams.\n\nLess than a week before announcing his intention to transfer, Williams signed the new deal at Washington, a development first reported by Pete Nakos of On3. Sources emphasized to Nakos that Williams remains under contract and that Washington expects him to be its starting quarterback in 2026 under head coach Jedd Fisch. The Huskies were also prepared to make Williams one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in college football.\n\nThe situation mirrors a similar case last year involving Wisconsin Badgers defender Xavier Lucas, who withdrew from Wisconsin and enrolled at Miami Hurricanes without entering the portal.\n\nWisconsin claimed Lucas was bound by a two-year NIL agreement and pursued legal action, with attorney Darren Heitner representing Lucas. That lawsuit remains ongoing, and Dellenger noted the language in Williams’ deal closely resembles the template used in the Wisconsin case.\n\nWilliams is coming off a standout sophomore season, throwing for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns while adding 611 rushing yards and six scores. In announcing his intent to transfer Tuesday night, Williams said the decision was made with his future in mind, though Washington appears prepared to enforce the contract he signed just days earlier.\n\n— On3’s Nick Schultz contributed to this article.",

    "description": "Seattle's defensive coordinator has risen quickly",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks are looking like victims of their own success. While the players are getting an extra week of rest due to the No. 1 seed, their coaches are busier than ever... even with non-Seahawks related matters. Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak is already getting plenty of requests from teams around the league to be their head coach, such as the Atlanta Falcons, but he isn't the only Seahawks coach drawing interest.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, NFL insider Ian Rapoport broke the news the Cleveland Browns have officially requested to interview Seahawks defensive coordinator Aden Durde for their open head coach position. Although head coach Mike Macdonald is the one who calls the plays on defense, Seattle's success on that side of the ball can certainly be attributed to help from Durde as well.\n\nThe #Browns have requested permission to interview #Seahawks DC Aden Durde for their vacant HC job, source said.\n\nThe native of England came to the NFL as a #Cowboys coaching intern and has risen quickly.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 6, 2026\n\nDurde has been the Seahawks' defensive coordinator for the last two seasons. Personally, I had some hope with Macdonald being the one who calls the plays, Durde might've remained a well-kept secret in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nNFL organizations cannot deny a coach from interviewing for a position that is an upgrade, so if Durde is interested in throwing his hat in the ring with the Browns, it will be up to him.\n\nAs for Kubiak, several other teams in the league have joined the Falcons in asking permission to interview him for their vacant head coaching spots. However, according to Albert Breer, Kubiak is still figuring out what to do with the requests.\n\nSeahawks OC Klint Kubiak has gotten requests to interview for the Giants, Cardinals, Raiders and Falcons head coaching jobs, per source. His focus is on the playoffs, so he'll take a day or two and figure out a plan to balance all of it.\n\nSeattle is on a bye as the NFC's 1 seed.\n\n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) January 6, 2026\n\nBoth of Seattle's coordinators getting interview requests is a challenge the Seahawks will have to navigate during the bye week. Teams can often lose focus during this time if they are not careful, which often results in catastrophic losses. Seattle needs to find a way to balance everything, as Breer mentioned in the tweet above, in order to maximize this rare opportunity for a potential Super Bowl run.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Cleveland Browns request to interview Seattle Seahawks DC Aden Durde",

    "description": "Former Arizona Cardinals head coach will apparently get a look from New York.",
    "fullText": "Kliff Kingsbury is leaving his job as Washington Commanders offensive coordinator to “pursue other opportunities.” One of those opportunities is likely to be with the New York Giants, where Kingsbury is expected to interview for the team’s vacant head-coaching position.\n\nKingsbury was offensive coordinator with Washington the past two seasons. His parting with the Commanders was described as a mutual decision between Kingsbury and Washington head coach Dan Quinn.\n\nKingsbury was praised for his work with the Commanders during Jayden Daniels’ 2024 rookie season as Washington went to the playoffs and had one of the league’s better offenses. With Daniels suffering through an injury-plagued 2025, the Commanders won just five games and Kingsbury’s offense was not nearly as prolific.\n\nDaniels and other Commanders players are apparently not happy with Kingsbury’s exit.\n\nKingsbury was head coach of the Arizona Cardinals for four seasons, from 2019-2022. He compiled a 28-37-1 (.432 winning percentage). His best season was 2021, when the Cardinals went 11-6 and lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams.\n\nPrior to Arizona, Kingsbury went 35-40 (.467) in six seasons as head coach at Texas Tech.\n\nI discussed Kingsbury with David Harrison, Commanders insider for Locked on Commanders, recently. Harrison said he would “lean to the side of no,” when I asked him if he thought Kingsbury should be in the conversation for the Giants.\n\n“I think that to be fair, like I don’t get to see, and you know this obviously, but to those who don’t, I don’t get to see Cliff do his day-to-day job and and all those things and full interaction with the players. So there there’s got to be a big grain of salt taken with I think any media member’s opinion on whether or not a guy would be a good head coach,” Harrison said. “But just looking at some of the things I can look at, Cliff still seems to be a guy who is very much kind of stuck in his way.\n\n“Kliff Kingsbury at the end of the day when he feels the he has the excuse, when he feels he has the reason, he’s going to revert back to what he wants to do. It’s not really about what is best for my team. It’s not and and don’t me wrong, like he thinks it’s best for his team, right? I should I should definitely put that in there. It’s not like he’s saying, “I don’t care that that’s what’s best. I want to do what I want to do.” Like, he thinks it’s best for his team. But what he doesn’t have is the situational awareness to understand that like, ‘No, it’s not’.\n\n“… until the head man says, “Hey dude, this is what we’re going to do.” He’s not going to see it himself. And if I’m hiring a head coach, I need a guy that can see the picture for what it is, not see the confirmation bias, that he wants to tell himself that he’s right all the time. And I just don’t think that Cliff is there.”",

    "description": "If the US operation in Venezuela tells us anything, it’s that Washington is thinking past the shale boom and back to a more traditional playbook.",
    "fullText": "If the US operation in Venezuela tells us anything, it’s that Washington is thinking past the shale boom and back to a more traditional playbook: secure access to oil abroad when supply at home looks less assured.\n\nStart with the numbers. The US Energy Information Administration expects US crude output to dip slightly in 2026, after several years of growth. That’s not a collapse. But it matters politically because shale is a treadmill: production stability depends on constant reinvestment, which in turn depends on price. Top-tier shale sites can work at lower prices, but meaningfully higher prices are required to profitably drill new wells.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Venezuela looks like a long-term option the US doesn’t want to leave to rivals. Recent reporting around the crisis frames the push as one where US oil firms are being invited back into a country with the world’s largest stated reserves, but a degraded industry, an opportunity some analysts describe as a “poisoned chalice,” with extra-heavy Venezuelan supply requiring high prices and heavy upfront investment to scale.\n\nThat brings us to the uncomfortable inference: This is oil security dressed up as strategy. And it hints at a return to a familiar American pattern — political interference in petrostates — that felt less central in the 2014-2024 period when shale growth and surging exports reduced the urgency of “barrels at any cost.”\n\nOil has often been the subtext of US foreign policy. The 1953 coup in Iran followed the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The point is not that “one company did it,” but that energy interests and state power intertwine when strategic supply appears at stake.\n\nToday, the corporate “face” of the Venezuela file is Chevron, not because it “controls” US policy, but because it sits at the chokepoint. With sanctions and licensing, Chevron has effectively become a valve, a channel through which some Venezuelan crude can still reach the US.\n\nThere’s also a quieter, very practical reason Venezuela matters: refinery physics. US shale is mostly light sweet. Venezuela’s flagship exports are often heavy sour. These are not interchangeable. What Venezuela can do, quickly, is redirect heavy barrels back to US Gulf Coast refineries that are built to run them — exactly the kind of trade shift that also happens to reduce China’s access to discounted sanctioned crude. For Washington, that China angle is a bonus argument, not the core driver.\n\nBut let’s be clear-eyed about the limits. Venezuela’s oil is hard to produce. Even optimistic investment roadmaps talk in multiyear timelines. So anyone expecting a fast flood of supply is likely to be disappointed. Even the reserve story is not simple. Venezuela may top the charts on paper, but “proved reserves” are an economic classification as much as a geological one.\n\nThat’s the deeper point for markets: Supply growth is not just about claimed resources. It’s about prices, production technology, political stability, know-how, and logistics.\n\nIf all of this is telling us anything, it’s that higher oil prices in the future may be needed to offset decline dynamics in both shale and extra-heavy oil provinces like Venezuela. Washington may be trying to secure additional future supply to cap price spikes, but that won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick.\n\nOPEC in a Shale Oil World: Where to Next?\n\nThe “Donroe Doctrine” gives Washington control of nearly 40% of the world oil output, and with it the power to keep crude prices close to $50 a barrel, writes Bloomberg Opinion’s Javier Blas.",
