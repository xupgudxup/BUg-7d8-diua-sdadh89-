    "description": "The investigation, which centers on renovations of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters in Washington, signals an escalation in the long-running clash between President Trump and the chair.",
    "fullText": "The U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia has opened a criminal investigation into Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, over the central bank’s renovation of its Washington headquarters and whether Mr. Powell lied to Congress about the scope of the project, according to officials briefed on the situation.\n\nThe inquiry, which includes an analysis of Mr. Powell’s public statements and an examination of spending records, was approved in November by Jeanine Pirro, a longtime ally of President Trump who was appointed to run the office last year, the officials said.\n\nThe investigation escalates Mr. Trump’s long-running feud with Mr. Powell, whom the president has continually attacked for resisting his demands to slash interest rates significantly. The president has threatened to fire the Fed chair — even though he nominated Mr. Powell for the position in 2017 — and raised the prospect of a lawsuit against him related to the $2.5 billion renovation, citing “incompetence.”\n\nMr. Trump told The New York Times in an interview last week that he had decided on who he wants to replace Mr. Powell as Fed chair. He is expected to soon announce his decision. Kevin A. Hassett, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, is a front-runner for the top job. While Mr. Powell’s term as chair ends in May, his term as a governor runs through January 2028. Mr. Powell has not disclosed whether he plans to stay on at the central bank beyond this year.\n\nIn a rare video message released by the Fed on Sunday, Mr. Powell described the investigation as “unprecedented” and questioned the motivation for the move, even as he affirmed that he carried out his duties as chair “without political fear or favor.”\n\n“This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,” he said. “It is not about Congress’s oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts.”\n\nHe warned that the investigation signaled a broader battle over the Fed’s independence. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”\n\nA spokesman for Attorney General Pam Bondi did not comment on the investigation but said Ms. Bondi had “instructed her U.S. attorneys to prioritize investing any abuses of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s investigation into Mr. Powell underscores Mr. Trump’s larger clash with the Fed. Other broadsides have included an effort to oust Lisa D. Cook, a governor at the central bank whom Mr. Trump tried to fire over allegations of mortgage fraud. Presidents are able to remove officials at the Fed only for “cause,” which has typically meant malfeasance or a dereliction of duty. The Supreme Court will hear arguments for Ms. Cook’s case on Jan. 21.\n\nCongress granted the Fed the authority to set interest rates free of meddling from presidents, whose political fortunes are often tethered to how the economy is faring. Rather, lawmakers stipulated that the central bank should pursue low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market.\n\nMr. Powell said on Sunday that the Justice Department had served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas. Prosecutors in Ms. Pirro’s office have contacted Mr. Powell’s staff multiple times to request documents about the renovation project, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation who discussed an open inquiry on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStarting an investigation is one thing, presenting sufficient evidence to secure an indictment from a federal grand jury — or making it stick — is another.\n\nIndictments against two of Mr. Trump’s top targets, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and Letitia James, the New York attorney general, were thrown out in November by a federal judge. An investigation into Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, has yet to yield enough evidence to present to a grand jury.\n\nThe renovations at the center of the investigation into Mr. Powell broke ground in 2022 and are set to be completed in 2027. They are estimated to be about $700 million over budget. The project involves expanding and modernizing the Marriner S. Eccles Building and another building on Constitution Avenue, which date to the 1930s.\n\nThe Fed has said that neither of those buildings has been “comprehensively renovated” since their construction nearly 100 years ago, suggesting they were in need of a significant overhaul. Part of the project includes removing asbestos and lead contamination as well as making the facilities compliant with laws related to accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nA 2021 version of the Fed’s proposal described private elevators and dining rooms for top policymakers, water fountains and new marble features, in addition to a rooftop terrace for staff. Pressed at a congressional hearing in June, Mr. Powell denied that many of those features were part of the latest proposal.\n\n“There’s no V.I.P. dining room; there’s no new marble,” he said. “We took down the old marble, we’re putting it back up. We’ll have to use new marble where some of the old marble broke. But there’s no special elevators. There’s just old elevators that have been there.”\n\nMr. Powell added that the project’s plans had “continued to evolve” and that some features that had been initially incorporated were scrapped.\n\nAfter Mr. Powell’s testimony, the Fed published a “Frequently Asked Questions” post on its website that reaffirmed Mr. Powell’s answers to lawmakers. The central bank continued to share additional details, including a virtual tour as well as photographs and annotations to the 2021 proposal that prompted the criticism.\n\nIn explaining the cost overruns, the central bank cited expenses tied to materials, equipment and labor as well as unforeseen circumstances, such as more asbestos than anticipated and soil contamination.",

    "title": "Cowboys news: Former Dallas 1st-round pick weighs in on who should be next DC",
    "description": "Your Sunday morning Cowboys news.",
    "fullText": "Ex-Cowboy has a daring take of who should be their next defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are on the hunt for a new defensive coordinator after Matt Eberflus was fired less than 48 hours after the season finale loss against the New York Giants. Former Cowboys defensive end Marcus Spears has a solution that fans may like, and it makes sense.\n\nOn ESPN’s NFL Live, Marcus Spears was asked who should be the Cowboys’ next defensive coordinator, and he didn’t hesitate to name former Atlanta Falcons head coach Raheem Morris. Spears pointed to Morris’ history of developing defensive backs, and Morris has already emerged as a popular candidate to help fix one of the NFL’s worst defenses in 2025.\n\n“Coverage is a big thing for Raheem, and if you notice, every place that he’s been, defensive coordinator-wise or head coach, he’s always had a star corner,” Spears said. “That’s just what he believes in.”\n\nMarcus Spears advocates for Raheem Morris to be Cowboys’ next defensive coordinator\n\nMorris has had defensive success everywhere he’s been for more than two decades. He was the defensive quality control coach during the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Super Bowl run back in the 2002 season, where he coached Hall of Fame secondary players like John Lynch, Ronde Barber and Super Bowl 37 MVP, Dexter Jackson.\n\nMorris was also the defensive coordinator for the Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams back in the 2021 season. It helped to have a monster like Aaron Donald controlling the line of scrimmage, but it’s no coincidence that Morris has been a part of multiple Super Bowl defenses.\n\nGeorge Pickens gets a just reward.\n\nIn his first season with the Cowboys, wide receiver George Pickens wasn’t just trying to benefit from having a fresh start, but was eyeing a big season in his “contract year” knowing he’d be a free agent in March. Not only did Pickens produce his best season with career-highs in every major category, but now he can add All-Pro to his list of accomplishments, that also saw him make his first Pro Bowl. Pickens is one of three Cowboys to earn second-team All-Pro honors by The Associated Press (AP). The list was announced on Saturday and also included a pair of special teams standouts.\n\nKicker Brandon Aubrey and return specialist KaVontae Turpin were also second-team All-Pros. Pickens was behind first-seamers Puka Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Ja’Marr Chase. Aubrey was on the second-team behind Vikings kicker Will Reichard and Turpin finished behind Buffalo’s Ray Davis.\n\nThis is the second year in a row the Cowboys landed a receiver, kicker and returner on the AP All-Pro teams. Last year, CeeDee Lamb and Turpin were first-teamers and Aubrey made the second-team. For Aubrey, he’s been selected on the All-Pro squad in each of his first three seasons in the NFL. In 2023, he was a first-team selection.\n\nAubrey was 36-of-42 on field goals, with all six misses occurring from 50 yards or more. He did make a 64-yard field goal as time expired in regulation, sending a Week 2 game vs. the Giants to overtime. Aubrey then became the first kicker in NFL history to make field goals to end regulation and overtime, helping Dallas to a 40-37 win.\n\nCould Quinnen’s brother make a good add?\n\nEvery offseason it seems like I see a linebacker’s name pop up that the Cowboys need to get to help the defense. This year it may be Quincy Williams. Could he be the guy the middle of the defense is missing? I’ve seen some reactions, and when you dig into the type of player he is the coverage numbers may make you second guess. And honestly, I get it because it doesn’t look pretty. When you actually dig into how Quincy Williams plays, and how he is used, the conversation changes fast. So let’s talk it through like fans, not scouts trying to sound smart.\n\nThe First Thing You Need to Know: This Dude Lives in the Box\n\nQuincy Williams is not a coverage linebacker, and he never has been. He will not be floating around in space trying to run with slot receivers or carry tight ends down the seams. When you look at the snap data, it’s not even debatable. He spent hundreds of snaps in the box, very few on the edge, only a handful in the slot, and almost none on the outside.\n\nThat tells you exactly how defenses should play him.  He is there to attack downhill. If you judge this man based on coverage stats alone, you’re grading a fish on how well it climbs trees. How Quincy Williams Actually Plays\n\nWhat I like about Quincy Williams is simple: when he sees it, he goes. There’s no dancing, no waiting for someone else to make the play. He triggers fast and shows up with bad intentions. Is he perfect? Absolutely not, but were any of the Cowboys linebackers last season even above average.\n\nHe will miss a tackle here and there because of his aggressive play style, but I’ll take that every day over a linebacker who catches blocks and gets pancaked. What I found even more impressive was he lines up all over the box. He can play weak side, strong side, and take inside looks, but he rarely just sat in the middle calling things out. He’s a flow-and-hunt guy, so the Cowboys would need to let him scrape, chase, and hit. That is where his game makes sense.\n\nThis may be another area where people will get twisted.  Yes, you will see him walked up near the line sometimes, but he’s not an edge rusher.  He is not winning with moves or stacking sacks. Those snaps are about pressure and confusion to make the offense account for him, mess with protection calls, and let the defense work around it. He’s a blitzer, not a technician, and if used incorrectly, it looks ugly.\n\n“My goal in life is to retire as the owner that won the most Super Bowls,” Jones said with complete seriousness. “That’s my goal.” Not just to win another one. Nope. To have the most of any owner in history. It was actually a shocking admission, given the recent state of the franchise. Jones obviously got off to a blistering start toward that achievement, winning three Lombardi Trophies in his first seven years of ownership, which was a literal lifetime ago.\n\nIt’s been 30 years since he added to that total. Only 10 of the players who finished the season with Dallas were even alive when Jones last won the big one. But now, at 83 years old, he wants to get serious about stockpiling? “How many more do I have to go as a single owner?” he asked the room. [New England’s] Bob [Kraft]’s got how many, six? I’ve got work to do.”\n\nTo be fair, Jones does seem, by all outward appearances, to be in fairly good health. But to suggest that he’s going to keep running the organization he’s always run it… and suddenly do something that hasn’t happened since the original Toy Story was still playing in movie theaters… and then do it THREE MORE TIMES in awfully quick succession seems too pie-in-the-sky for even the most wildly delusional Cowboys fan.\n\nQuite frankly, one more trophy would be a staggeringly earth-shaking development for this franchise under its current power structure. The only thing crazier than Jones coming right out and saying he plans to win four more championships before he “retires” is the fact that it was only the third-craziest thing he said during Wednesday’s press conference.",

    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals requested an interview with San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh earlier in the week.\n\nWe’re going to go out on a limb and say that Saleh won’t take the chance in his second head coaching stint in the NFC West, where three of the best coaches in the NFL reside. Not to mention, the Cardinals have had three total wins in the division during the past three seasons—just a hunch.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Baltimore Ravens requested Saleh for their head coaching vacancy after firing John Harbaugh after 18 seasons.\n\nIn December, it was reported that Saleh would be patient and not jump at the opportunity to coach again if it wasn’t a fit. On Thursday, Saleh was asked about his focus on the playoffs with the NFL coaching openings. Saleh said, “The league has done a nice job structuring the interview process, allowing focus on the job at hand. Haven’t thought about it. I know things come in but don’t have to deal with it until next week.”\n\nThe Ravens’ job has to be intriguing for anybody. They have one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL when healthy, and play in a division that pales in comparison to the NFC West. Baltimore also has building blocks, like Kyle Hamilton, and has generally a playoff team since Lamar Jackson took over as the starter.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the Atlanta Falcons and Tennessee Titans also requested an interview for Saleh. So, he’s once again a popular candidate during this coaching cycle.\n\nKyle’s update, 9:56 a.m. PT: NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported the Miami Dolphins put in a request to interview 49ers’ DC Robert Saleh, making it his fifth interview during this cycle. He’s close to interviewing for every head coaching vacancy. The Dolphins going from the former Niners offensive coordinator to their defensive coordinator would be entertaining.",

    "fullText": "Following the publication of a report in The New York Times on Friday night revealing that the Washington National Opera will be leaving the Kennedy Center, members of the Trump administration immediately began scrambling to reframe the news as not only a positive, but their idea.\n\nKennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi, who has been hard at work lashing out at artists for canceling scheduled performances at the once-revered venue, posted a statement to X claiming that the center’s relationship with the opera group has “presented ongoing financial challenges for well over a decade” that “long predate the current leadership.”\n\n“Given the longstanding financial strain, it has become necessary for us to part ways to protect the best interests of the Center,” Daravi wrote.\n\nThe statement was then amplified by the venue’s Donald Trump-appointed executive director Richard Grenell, who elaborated on the difficulties surrounding exclusivity agreements.\n\n“Having an exclusive relationship has been extremely expensive and limiting in choice and variety,” Grenell wrote on X. “We approached the Opera leadership last year with this idea and they began to be open to it.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, he wrote, “The exclusive Opera contract cost the Trump Kennedy Center $64 million over the last 10 years—with their expenses being double their revenues.”\n\n“We were very pleased that the current Opera leadership was so willing to end their exclusivity,” he noted.\n\nThe New York Times report states that the decision to sever ties was made by the Washington National Opera, with the board of trustees approving a resolution on Friday that will enable the group to terminate its agreement with the venue.\n\n“Today, the Washington National Opera announced its decision to seek an amicable early termination of its affiliation agreement with the Kennedy Center and resume operations as a fully independent nonprofit entity,” a statement provided to The New York Times said.\n\nOpera officials told the paper that new venues in Washington D.C. have been lined up but that no leases have been signed. They declined to name specific venues.\n\nWith the passing of the resolution, the WNO will now seek to move its performances out of the center’s opera house and reduce the number of performances staged there.\n\nThe decision marks the end of a partnership between the Kennedy Center and the WNO that dates back to 1971.\n\nWhile the WNO did not mention the Kennedy Center’s MAGA rebrand as the reason for its departure, they have noted disagreements with new requirements that have been made under the cultural center’s new management.\n\nSeveral well-known performers have canceled planned events since President Donald Trump’s takeover of the center, which saw him fire the board in order to populate it with his allies and install himself as chair.\n\nTrump further ignited tensions when he attempted to rebrand the center to bear his name, ignoring the fact that any formal change requires congressional action. A lawsuit was filed shortly after, challenging the rebrand.\n\nIn response to Trump’s actions, several artists have canceled planned appearances at the performing arts venue, including comedian Issa Rae, folk act Rhiannon Giddens, musician Kristy Lee, trumpeter Wayne Tucker, and Grammy-winning bluegrass performer Béla Fleck.\n\nOn Thursday, singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos canceled her Feb. 7 performance at the Kennedy Center, citing her Mexican heritage and the Trump administration’s immigration policies as the reasons behind her decision.\n\n“As an artist, I treasure the freedom to create and share my music, and for many years I have used this privilege to uplift the stories of immigrants in this country,” the Grammy-nominated musician wrote on Thursday. “Unfortunately, I do not feel that the current climate at this beloved venue represents a welcoming space for myself, my band, or our audience.”",

Ohio State also makes 78.4% of its free throws (eighth in the country) but struggles from distance, converting only 34.3% of its 3-pointers.\n\nIn the win over Oregon, all five starters scored in double figures. Devin Royal and Christoph Tilly each had 14 points, senior leader Bruce Thornton had 12, John Mobley Jr. added 13, and Amare Bynum chipped in with 10. Thornton has 1,787 career points, recently passed Jim Jackson for seventh in program history.\n\nHead coach Jake Diebler is in his third season at Ohio State nad had led the team to a 36-22 record.\n\nThe Huskies protect the ball (10.8 turnovers per game is in the top 100 nationally) and shoot well at the line (77.7% on free throws), but field goal shooting is a major weakness. Washington are shooting 51.9% inside the 3-point line, which ranks 229th in the country.\n\nWashington is on a two-game losing streak after falling 81-73 to No. 5 Purdue on the road Wednesday. Star freshman forward Hannes Steinbach (17 points, averaging 18.2 points and 11.2 rebounds per game) led four starters in double-figures as Washington rallied from a 17-point deficit behind Quimari Peterson (15 points), Zoom Diallo (14) and Franck Kepnang (10).\n\nHead coach Danny Sprinkle is in his second season at Washington after winning the Mountain West regular title and an NCAA Tournament game with Utah State in 2023-24.\n\nWhere: Alaska Airlines Arena in Seattle, Washington\n\nNorthwestern vs. Rutgers, 5 p.m. ET\n\nYou are eligible if you meet all the following criteria:\n\nAre a current or incoming student enrolled in an undergraduate or advanced degree program at a Title IV-accredited college or university in the US who meets verification qualifications;\n\nReside in the United States (including its territories, commonwealths and possessions); and\n\nProvide Peacock with a valid payment method.\n\nCollege/university information (e.g., first name, last name, school email address, college/university name, date of birth and other necessary documentation) must be shared with SheerID for verification purposes.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 running back room could feature a new face from the transfer portal, and while Baylor transfer back Bryson Washington made his way to College Station this weekend, Washington is now in the mix for the Texas native, which have have made a significant push this week. However, this doesn't rule out the Aggies landing a transfer running back, as a new name has emerged.\n\nAccording to AggieYell insider Jaxson Callaway, Texas A&M is now targeting Michigan State transfer running back Makhi Frazier, who is reportedly coming off a Friday visit to Ohio State. While this may seem daunting, the Aggies have won multiple transfer battles against the Buckeyes this month. Still, adding another running back isn't A&M's top priority compared to other programs.\n\nWashington is still the No. 1 running back target for head coach Mike Elko and his staff, and Callaway is right to state that the rest of the RB portal market will depend on Washington's choice regarding which way the Huskies will go.\n\n\"At the moment, much of the running back market appears to be waiting on Washington’s decision.\"\n\nFocusing on Frazier, the McKinney, Texas native is listed at 5'10\" and nearly 220 pounds, and is coming off an impressive 2025 sophomore campaign after rushing for 520 yards and two touchdowns, averaging 4.5 yards per carry.\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Frazier earned a solid offensive grade (74.8) and a rushing grade (77.6), which bodes well for his future as a potential starting or No. 2 running back. Frazier will continue to be a name to watch, but until Bryson Washington makes his decision, both players will be the top backs on the Aggies' radar.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Transfer RB Makhi Frazier has emerged as a Texas A&M target",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — For House Republicans, the political year started with a pep rally of sorts as President Donald Trump gathered them at Washington's Kennedy Center for a stemwinder of a speech. But by the time lawmakers had completed their first week of work this midterm election year, fractures in the party were already showing.\n\nFrom pushback to Trump's self-described “Donroe doctrine” of aggression in the Western Hemisphere to breaks in party unity over health care, Republican lawmakers are displaying signs of independence from Trump after spending much of the last year acquiescing to his practically every demand. It showed a new dynamic in the GOP as Republicans embark on difficult campaign to keep control of both the House and Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, speaking at the U.S.-Mexico border Friday with a group of Republican Senate candidates, said that Republicans were “going to be focused like a laser” on issues of affordability and pointed to legislation in the works on housing and health care.\n\nThune's border trip and talk of affordability were a nod back to some of the core themes of Trump's presidential campaign. But the focus in Washington of late has instead been dominated by Trump's military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, his threats to use military force to take control of Greenland, the release of case files on Jeffrey Epstein and a debate over extending subsidies for insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act — an issue where Republicans have long struggled to find unity.\n\nRecent shootings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in several U.S. cities, including one that killed a woman in Minneapolis, have also raised new questions about Republicans' hard-line immigration agenda and shifted attention away from Trump's handling of the border, which they see as a political success.\n\nEven so, Trump still has plenty of command over most of the party. That was demonstrated this week by a pair of unsuccessful House veto override votes in which most GOP members stuck with the president despite previously voting for the low-profile bills.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few Republicans to consistently defy Trump, said that “there was some bully pulpit intimidation going on” from the president that caused the veto overrides to fail.\n\nStill, Democrats are making the case that Trump is becoming distracted from the needs of Americans, especially after the attack on Venezuela.\n\n“He's lurching towards another endless, expensive war, all the while American families here are struggling with skyrocketing costs,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nVenezuela war powers vote draws GOP support\n\nTo prove their point, Democrats are forcing votes on war powers resolutions that would stop Trump from attacking Venezuela without congressional approval. Such measures are rarely successful, but a procedural vote on the legislation drew support from five Republicans Thursday, setting up a final vote next week. House Democrats are also pushing forward a similar resolution.\n\nThe GOP senators who voted for the legislation tried to defuse the conflict with Trump by arguing their positions were in line with his own campaign promises to scale back U.S. commitments overseas.\n\n“A drawn-out campaign in Venezuela involving the American military, even if unintended, would be the opposite of President Trump’s goal of ending foreign entanglements,” Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who voted for the war powers resolution, said in a lengthy statement explaining his vote.\n\nTrump reacted with fury. The president promptly called for the five Republicans, which included Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who is up for reelection this year, to “never be elected to office again.”\n\nRepublicans are already dealing with retirements from several lawmakers who had uneasy relationships with Trump, and there was worry that such clashes could complicate their campaign picture even more.\n\n“If Susan isn’t the senator from Maine, we’re going to end up with a Democrat,” said Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican. “That would be 10 times worse. But I do appreciate that President Trump is absolutely pissed off.”\n\nGOP pushes back on Trump's Greenland plans\n\nTrump's desire to possess Greenland and his administration's decision not to rule out military force also met significant resistance from GOP lawmakers this week.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who is retiring after crossing Trump last summer, took to the Senate floor to proclaim that he was “sick of stupid.” He specifically criticized White House deputy chief of policy Stephen Miller, who made comments that Greenland should be part of the U.S.\n\n“I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy,” Tillis added. “And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”\n\nOther Republicans, including Thune and Senate Armed Services Committee chair Sen. Roger Wicker, also gently pushed back on military threats against Denmark, which is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nAfter meeting with the Danish ambassador, Wicker said it was Denmark's right not to sell Greenland.\n\n“I’m troubled by Greenland. I'm troubled by some of the things he does. I don’t get it,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, another retiring Republican. “I do feel like Congress should be more independent and should provide checks and balances here.”\n\nBacon added that Trump still had the ability to “bully” his Republican colleagues, but that Trump's threats had “stiffened my spine.”\n\nHealth care votes expose divisions\n\nDuring Trump's speech at the Kennedy Center on Tuesday, he urged Republicans to own the issue of health care. Yet when the House voted Thursday on a Democratic proposal to extend expired health care subsidies for Affordable Care Act health plans, 17 Republicans broke with party leadership to help pass the bill.\n\n“People recognize the challenge here, which is to address health care affordability,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who voted for the proposal.\n\nHe still criticized the Affordable Care Act, a hallmark piece of legislation for Democrats, yet the health care debate unfolding in Congress is one that Democrats feel confident making a central campaign issue.\n\n“In this first, full week of the new year, House Democrats — every single one of us joined by 17 Republicans — have partnered in a bipartisan way to protect the health care of the American people,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries following the vote.\n\nJan. 6 plaque coming out of storage\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, Trump told House Republicans that he had told his supporters to go “peacefully and patriotically” to confront Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election. The White House also unveiled a website that portrayed the Jan. 6 attack as a “witch hunt” against him by Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut the Senate, which Republicans control, this week agreed to display a plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol — a cause that has become a point of contention with Trump as president. The plaque had been kept in storage rather than being displayed because House Speaker Mike Johnson had said the memorial did not comply with the law.\n\nIt was Tillis again who pushed the issue on the Republican side. He said it was important to honor the police and staff who risked their own lives and safety that day.\n\nDemocrats who joined in the effort said they were alarmed by the White House's attempt to recast the narrative.\n\n“It's so important we be honest with the American people about what happened,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.\n\nThis story has corrected the party affiliation of Rep. Mike Lawler. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.",

    "fullText": "Trae Young reveals why he wanted to be traded to Wizards originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStar guard Trae Young raised some eyebrows when it was reported that his preferred trade destination was the Washington Wizards. Players don’t typically want to get traded to Washington. If anything, the opposite is usually the case.\n\nBut, Young wanted the Wizards, and he ultimately got his wish, as the Atlanta Hawks relocated him to Washington earlier this week.\n\nDuring his introductory press conference with the Wizards, Young explained what it was about Washington that was attractive to him.\n\n“I’m just super excited. For me, D.C. is overlooked as far as a big market. In the NBA, I feel like this is a big market,” Young said. “I just feel like I’m coming into an opportunity to be myself. I’m around people that obviously have known me for a long time and know the type of person I am and the type of winner I want to be.\n\n“And I know it's a day-by-day process. I know what it takes. It's not going to be easy. But I know this is a place that I'm excited about and I was excited about whenever I heard it could be a possibility.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen when Young when make his debut for the Wizards. He's dealing with a sprained knee and a quad bruise and hasn't appeared in a game since Dec. 27.\n\nWhen he does return, he’ll be sporting a different number. Young wore No. 11 during his time in Atlanta, but that number is retired in Washington, so he was forced to switch to No. 3.\n\nIt also remains to be seen how long Trae’s tenure in Washington will last. The four-time All-Star has a player option in his contract for next season, which he could turn down in favor of unrestricted free agency. Though, one would assume that the Wizards traded for Young with the intension of inking him to an extension.\n\nThe expectation around the league is that Young will indeed sign an extension with Washington, per ESPN, but it remains to be seen when that might happen.\n\nNBA legend blasts Hawks over Trae Young trade, labels them a 'mid' franchise\n\nLuka Doncic reacts to Trae Young trade to Washington Wizards\n\nCJ McCollum reacts to being traded to Atlanta Hawks for Trae Young",

    "fullText": "The Cowboys are set to begin interviews for their defensive coordinator opening. Just 72 hours after the firing of Matt Eberflus, the team will kick off the conversations to find his replacement with three meetings reportedly over the next two days.\n\nPer NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, the Cowboys will interview Vikings assistant Daronte Jones and Browns assistant Ephraim Banda on Friday, with Broncos assistant Jim Leonhard rounding out the current slate on Saturday.\n\nThe Cowboys had hoped to also speak with Falcons assistant Jeff Ulbrich but was denied permission, as Atlanta reportedly hopes to keep him on staff to serve under their next as-yet-unnamed head coach.\n\n#Cowboys will conduct their 1st round of defensive coordinator interviews today, speaking with #Vikings defensive pass game coordinator Daronte Jones and #Browns safeties coach Ephraim Banda, then they'll speak with #Broncos defensive pass game coordinator Jim Leonhard tomorrow.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 9, 2026\n\nHead coach Brian Schottenheimer said earlier in the week that the process of evaluating their current coaching staff could take \"10 to 12 days,\" but announced a parting of the ways with Eberflus the following day, after a historically poor season that saw the Dallas defense give up a franchise-worst 30 points per game.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones explained in the team's season-ending press conference that neither prior head coaching nor coordinator experience at the pro level would be considered a prerequisite for the current DC job; none of the current candidates have either.\n\nHere's a quick look at the first three interviewees for the role.\n\nJones has been Minnesota's defensive pass game coordinator since 2023 and was the Vikings' defensive backs coach in 2022 and also in 2020 (with a year as LSU's defensive coordinator in between). The 47-year-old is thought to bring a lot of the qualities that the team likes in current Vikings DC Brian Flores. The Jets have also requested permission to interview Jones for their DC job.\n\nBanda, 44, has coached the Browns' safeties since 2023, hired to the job by current defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz. Despite the team's 5-12 record this season, Banda safeties Grant Delpit and Ronnie Hickman helped the team put up top-three numbers in passing yards allowed. Prior to Cleveland, Banda spent a dozen years in the college ranks; he worked defensive quality control at Mississippi State in 2015, Dak Prescott's senior year.\n\nLeonhard is considered by many to be a rising star in the coaching world. After 10 years as an NFL safety, he went back to his alma mater of Wisconsin to begin his coaching career and then returned to Denver (where he played in 2012) to be the Broncos' defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator in 2024. Last year, the 43-year-old added assistant head coach to his job duties. Leonhard has history with Brian Schottenheimer; he was a Jet for three years while Schottenheimer was offensive coordinator there.\n\nTodd is on X at @ToddBrock24f7.

Both said disarming non-state groups was a priority upon beginning their terms not long after the ceasefire went into effect.\n\nLebanon's top officials have endorsed the military announcement.\n\nA statement by Aoun’s office ahead of the Cabinet meeting called on Israel to stop its attacks, withdraw from areas it occupies, and release Lebanese prisoners. He called on friendly countries not to send weapons to Lebanon unless it's to state institutions — an apparent reference to Iran which for decades has sent weapons and munitions to Hezbollah.\n\nSpeaker Nabih Berri, a key ally of Hezbollah who played a leading role in ceasefire talks, issued a statement saying the people of southern Lebanon are “thirsty for the army's presence and protection.\"\n\nIsrael maintains that despite Lebanon’s efforts, Hezbollah is still attempting to rearm itself in southern Lebanon.\n\n“The ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States between Israel and Lebanon states clearly, Hezbollah must be fully disarmed,\" a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office read. “This is imperative for Israel’s security and Lebanon’s future.”\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry said in a later statement that the group is “rearming faster than it is being disarmed,\" and showed a map of alleged Hezbollah compounds, launch sites, and underground networks south of the Litani River.\n\nPlan to restrict weapons at an ‘advanced stage’\n\nThe text of the ceasefire agreement is vague as to how Hezbollah’s weapons and military facilities north of the Litani River should be treated, saying Lebanese authorities should dismantle unauthorized facilities starting with the area south of the river.\n\nHezbollah insists that the agreement only applies south of the Litani, while Israel maintains that it applies to the whole country. The Lebanese government has said it will eventually remove non-state weapons throughout the country.\n\nThe agreement is seen as a procedure to implement prior United Nations Security Council agreements that call for disarmament of non-state groups and the withdrawal of all occupying forces, and for the Lebanese state to have full control of its territory.\n\nInformation Minister Paul Morcos said after the Cabinet meeting that the army will start working on a plan for disarmament north of the Litani river that will be discussed by the government in February. He added that the army will also continue the process of weapons “containment” in other parts of Lebanon, meaning that they will not be allowed to be used or moved.\n\nThe Lebanese military has been clearing tunnels, rocket-launching positions, and other structures since its disarmament proposal was approved by the government and went into effect in September.\n\nThe government had set a deadline of the end of 2025 to clear the area south of the Litani River of non-state weapons.\n\n“The army confirms that its plan to restrict weapons has entered an advanced stage, after achieving the goals of the first phase effectively and tangibly on the ground,” the military statement read. “Work in the sector is ongoing until the unexploded ordnance and tunnels are cleared ... with the aim of preventing armed groups from irreversibly rebuilding their capabilities.”\n\nHezbollah did not immediately comment on the Lebanese announcement.\n\nOfficials have said the next stage of the disarmament plan is in segments of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which include Lebanon’s port city of Sidon, but they have not set a timeline for that phase.\n\nIsrael continues to strike Lebanon near daily and occupies five strategic hilltop points along the border, the only areas south of the Litani where the military said it has yet to control.\n\nRegular meetings have taken place between the Lebanese and the Israelis alongside the United States, France, and the U.N. peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, to monitor developments after the ceasefire.\n\nLebanon’s cash-strapped military has since been gradually dispersing across wide areas of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the U.N.-demarcated “Blue Line” that separates the tiny country from Israel. The military has also been slowly confiscating weapons from armed Palestinian factions in refugee camps.\n\nIsrael accuses Hezbollah of trying to rebuild its battered military capacity and has said that the Lebanese military’s efforts are not sufficient, raising fears of a new escalation. Lebanon, meanwhile, said Israel's strikes and control of the hilltops were an obstacle to the efforts.\n\nLebanon also hopes that disarming Hezbollah and other non-state groups will help to bring in money needed for reconstruction after the 2024 war.\n\nHezbollah says it has been cooperative with the army in the south but will not discuss disarming elsewhere before Israel stops its strikes and withdraws from Lebanese territory.\n\nThe latest Israel-Hezbollah conflict began the day after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel triggered the war in Gaza. The militant group Hezbollah, largely based in southern Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024. Israeli strikes killed much of Hezbollah's senior leadership and left the group severely weakened.\n\nHezbollah still has political clout, holding a large number of seats in parliament representing the Shiite Muslim community and two cabinet ministers.",

    "fullText": "Demond Williams transfer portal controversy, explained: Why Washington is blocking QB from leaving recent contract originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWashington Huskies quarterback Demond Williams, coming off a 31-total-touchdown season in the Big Ten as a sophomore, announced Tuesday that he would be entering the transfer portal.\n\nIn 2026, that's almost become the norm for big-name college quarterbacks. Plenty of star passers, from Dylan Raiola to DJ Lagway, made exits from their schools this college football offseason. But in Williams' case, his announced decision sparked controversy.\n\nJust days before Williams' transfer announcement, he had reportedly agreed to return to the Huskies for the 2026 season, signing a contract to do so. And in response to his attempted exit, Washington is \"prepared to pursue all legal avenues\" if Williams is not living up to that deal.\n\nHere's everything to know about Demond Williams' transfer portal controversy.\n\nMORE:Tracking the QBs on the move in the transfer portal\n\nWilliams, who spent the first two seasons of his career at Washington and excelled as a sophomore starter in 2025, shared an Instagram post on Tuesday announcing he'd be entering the transfer portal.\n\n\"I have to do what is best for me and my future,\" he wrote. \"After much thought and prayer, I will be entering the transfer portal.\"\n\nThe problem, however, was that Williams had already signed a contract to return to the Huskies last week, per ESPN's Pete Thamel. The deal was reportedly considered \"top of the market,\" and Thamel also added that Williams entered the portal with a \"do not contact\" tag, meaning he likely already had a destination in mind.\n\nAccording to Thamel, Washington is now \"prepared to pursue all legal avenues to enforce Williams' signed contract,\" and the quarterback's situation has also \"drawn the attention of the Big Ten.\"\n\nRoss Dellenger also reported that Washington officials \"suspect\" that another school contacted Williams after he had already signed his Huskies deal. In response, Washington reportedly plans to submit evidence of tampering. On Wednesday, Dellenger added that Big Ten commissioner Tony Pelitti has become \"heavily involved in the matter.\"\n\nAccording to Matt Zenitz, LSU, which is still eyeing a quarterback after landing Lane Kiffin, is expected to be the \"team to watch\" for Williams if he's able to transfer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pete Nakos reported that Washington has no plans to enter Williams' name in the transfer portal due to his signed contract. The Big Ten is \"standing behind UW's fervent approach to the contract,\" per Dellenger.\n\nWashington officials are expected to meet Wednesday with Williams' representatives, and because the Huskies are refusing to enter Williams' name into the portal, he cannot hold conversations with other teams, per Dellenger.\n\nOn Thursday, Williams' agent, Doug Hendrickson, announced that he was dropping Williams as a client due to \"philosophical differences.\"\n\n— Doug Hendrickson (@DHendrickson41) January 8, 2026\n\nMORE: How Lane Kiffin's transfer portal acquisitions at LSU have started roughly\n\nDemond Williams had reportedly agreed to a deal with Washington days before he announced he would be entering the transfer portal.\n\nAn update thread on the Demond Williams situation with Washington, per sources to @YahooSports:\n- Williams signed a one-year rev-share agreement with UW worth about $4M.\n- The agreement is a Big Ten template document used by all league members and built for situations like this.\n\n— Ross Dellenger (@RossDellenger) January 7, 2026\n\nPete Thamel reported that the contract had been \"top of the market,\" while Ross Dellenger reported that Washington officials described the contract as \"a legally binding revenue-share contract with the school.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Ross Dellenger provided further details about the contract. It was a one-year revenue-share agreement with Washington worth about $4 million, per Dellenger. The agreement \"prohibits a player from entering the portal once signed\" and \"prohibits the player’s NIL rights to be used by any other school, though the player can sign outside marketing agreements.\"\n\nThamel also added that the buyout of Williams' contact reads the cost of the buyout is in the “sole discretion” of Washington, and it specifically states that “the institution is not obligated to enter the Student-Athlete into the transfer portal or otherwise assist or facilitate the Student-Athlete’s transfer to another college or university.”\n\nHere's a look at Williams' numbers through two seasons at Washington.\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal",

    "fullText": "As Demond Williams Jr. looks to leave Washington, his agent said Thursday that he’s no longer representing the Huskies’ QB.\n\nDoug Hendrickson said in a social media post that he had “made the decision to end my representation of Demond Williams Jr. effective immediately due to philosophical differences.” Hendrickson, who is part of the Wasserman Football agency, said that he wished “him and his family the best in their future endeavors.”\n\nHendrickson is also the agent for Washington coach Jedd Fisch.\n\nYahoo Sports’ Ross Dellenger reported Wednesday that Williams had signed a one-year deal with Washington for the 2026 season that was worth approximately $4 million. Per that agreement, the school can prohibit Williams from entering the portal after the deal is signed and the deal also forbids another school to use the player’s NIL rights.\n\nSince Williams hasn’t been officially entered into the transfer portal, NCAA rules prohibit him from talking to other schools. However, coaches across the country have been speaking out against tampering for months. And it’s hard to believe that many — if any — coaches who have publicly complained about tampering haven’t at least indirectly engaged it in themselves.\n\n- UW officials suspect that Williams has already held conversations with other programs and the school plans to submit any tampering evidence to the league and NCAA.\n- LSU is believed to be the school most interested in Williams.\n\n— Ross Dellenger (@RossDellenger) January 7, 2026\n\nLSU has been mentioned heavily as a school with interest in Williams. Lane Kiffin is searching for a transfer quarterback ahead of the 2026 season as Cincinnati’s Brendan Sorsby committed to Texas Tech and current Ole Miss QB Trinidad Chambliss is set to stay with the Rebels if the NCAA will grant him a sixth year of eligibility.\n\nWilliams would immediately become the best available QB if and when he enters the transfer portal. He was 246-of-354 passing for 3,065 yards and 25 TDs across 13 games while also rushing 143 times for 611 yards and six scores.",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA -- Injuries and health issues have defined the Philadelphia 76ers for the better part of two years now. The Sixers were expected to contend for a championship in 2024-25 after bringing in Paul George, but they went 24-58 as injuries decimated the roster.\n\nEven though they have been winning in 2025-26, the Sixers have still been snake-bitten a bit as players have been in and out of the lineup. Philadelphia has just not been able to find any type of rhythm or consistency in terms of their lineups.\n\nHowever, in Wednesday's 131-110 win over the Washington Wizards, the Sixers had their full complement of players since Dec. 18, 2023. Joel Embiid, Kelly Oubre Jr., and Trendon Watford were all available for the Sixers after initially being listed as questionable and then upgraded to probable.\n\n\"It's good,\" Embiid said. \"Just gotta keep on going, but like I said, it's all about being smart, and do it the right way, but, you know, I guess good accomplishment, but it's just got to be consistent, which we've been.\"\n\nNo Sixers are unavailable for tonight's game because of injury or personal reasons.\n\nPer my notes, this is the first time that has happened since 12/18/23.\n\nTonight will be the 11th time Nick Nurse has coached a fully healthy version of Sixers. It is his 199th game with the team.\n\n— Adam Aaronson (@SixersAdam) January 7, 2026\n\nEmbiid had 28 points, seven rebounds, and two blocks in 25 minutes. This comes after he played 40 minutes against the Denver Nuggets on Monday. The big fella is continuing to string games together and it's all great things for him and the Sixers to continue building on as time moves forward.\n\n\"I feel good,\" Embiid stated. \"Pretty good. Just gotta keep it going. I thought, tonight, I was OK tonight, so that's a good sign. Like I said, just gotta keep going. We’re still building myself back up. You just have to be smart.\"\n\nThe Sixers will begin a 3-game road trip on Friday when they take on the Orlando Magic and then head up to Toronto for a back-to-back with the Raptors. It will be interesting to see how Embiid is handled in terms of his minutes and which game he plays in against the Raptors.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Joel Embiid reacts to Sixers finally being fully healthy vs. Wizards",

    "fullText": "Coaches for teams in the wild card round won't be available for head coaching interviews until next week and one of the assistants who is seen as likely to see some interest is Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula.\n\nShula is in his second year as a coordinator and he's been with the Rams since 2017. Being a Sean McVay assistant is generally a good path to a head coaching job and Shula adds to that by being McVay's college roommate as well as the grandson of the legendary Don Shula.\n\nOn Wednesday, Shula said he took time during the summer and the team's bye week to prepare for potential head coaching interviews. That's allowed him to be \"locked in on that routine\" ahead of this week's game against the Panthers while waiting to see \"if the right situation presents itself\" in this cycle.\n\n“I think that’s the goal of any coach that wants to be in this league,” Shula said, via Greg Beachum of the Associated Press. “That doesn’t mean you’re just going to walk away for any opportunity. I love it here, and my family loves it here. We’ve been here nine, 10 years, coaching with my best friend. We obviously have a great group of players and a great staff. So for the right opportunity, we’ll see.”\n\nThe Rams defense was part of the reason for the 3-3 finish that ended their hopes of taking the top seed in the NFC, but a rebound in Carolina would put them right where they want to be and it wouldn't do anything to hurt Shula's chances of making the next step up the coaching ladder.",

Early in the second period, Canadian Olympic defenseman Thomas Harley made the play to set up Sam Steel’s net-front tap-in past Thompson\n\nSteel assisted on Wyatt Johnston’s goal, his 24th of the season, with 6:29 left in regulation. Roope Hintz sealed it with an empty-netter with 18.6 seconds remaining.\n\nBefore that, Alex Ovechkin scored his 915th career goal, adding to his NHL record total, with 2:19 left and Thompson pulled for an extra attacker.

    "fullText": "New details have emerged surrounding Demond Williams and his attempt to enter the transfer portal, shedding light on why Washington officials are refusing to process his request.\n\nAccording to Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports, Williams recently signed a one-year revenue-sharing agreement with the Huskies worth approximately $4 million. The agreement is a Big Ten–approved template used by all conference members and was specifically designed to address scenarios like this.\n\nThe contract evidently prohibits Williams from entering the transfer portal once signed, and restricts his NIL rights from being used by another school. He’s still allowed to pursue outside marketing deals per Dellenger.\n\nAs a result, Washington has declined to enter Williams’ name into the portal, which prevents him from holding conversations with other programs. Dellenger reported that Big Ten Conference commissioner Tony Petitti is heavily involved in the matter, along with other league officials.\n\nAdditionally, the conference is backing Washington’s firm stance. Coincidentally, Petitti is in Seattle this week for a memorial service while discussions continue.\n\nMoreover, Washington officials are expected to communicate later Tuesday with Williams’ representatives regarding next steps. The school also suspects Williams has already spoken with other programs and plans to submit any evidence of tampering to both the conference and the NCAA. LSU is believed to be the program most interested in Williams.\n\nLess than a week before announcing his intention to transfer, Williams signed the new deal at Washington, a development first reported by Pete Nakos of On3. Sources emphasized to Nakos that Williams remains under contract and that Washington expects him to be its starting quarterback in 2026 under head coach Jedd Fisch. The Huskies were also prepared to make Williams one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in college football.\n\nThe situation mirrors a similar case last year involving Wisconsin Badgers defender Xavier Lucas, who withdrew from Wisconsin and enrolled at Miami Hurricanes without entering the portal.\n\nWisconsin claimed Lucas was bound by a two-year NIL agreement and pursued legal action, with attorney Darren Heitner representing Lucas. That lawsuit remains ongoing, and Dellenger noted the language in Williams’ deal closely resembles the template used in the Wisconsin case.\n\nWilliams is coming off a standout sophomore season, throwing for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns while adding 611 rushing yards and six scores. In announcing his intent to transfer Tuesday night, Williams said the decision was made with his future in mind, though Washington appears prepared to enforce the contract he signed just days earlier.\n\n— On3’s Nick Schultz contributed to this article.",

    "description": "Seattle's defensive coordinator has risen quickly",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks are looking like victims of their own success. While the players are getting an extra week of rest due to the No. 1 seed, their coaches are busier than ever... even with non-Seahawks related matters. Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak is already getting plenty of requests from teams around the league to be their head coach, such as the Atlanta Falcons, but he isn't the only Seahawks coach drawing interest.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, NFL insider Ian Rapoport broke the news the Cleveland Browns have officially requested to interview Seahawks defensive coordinator Aden Durde for their open head coach position. Although head coach Mike Macdonald is the one who calls the plays on defense, Seattle's success on that side of the ball can certainly be attributed to help from Durde as well.\n\nThe #Browns have requested permission to interview #Seahawks DC Aden Durde for their vacant HC job, source said.\n\nThe native of England came to the NFL as a #Cowboys coaching intern and has risen quickly.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 6, 2026\n\nDurde has been the Seahawks' defensive coordinator for the last two seasons. Personally, I had some hope with Macdonald being the one who calls the plays, Durde might've remained a well-kept secret in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nNFL organizations cannot deny a coach from interviewing for a position that is an upgrade, so if Durde is interested in throwing his hat in the ring with the Browns, it will be up to him.\n\nAs for Kubiak, several other teams in the league have joined the Falcons in asking permission to interview him for their vacant head coaching spots. However, according to Albert Breer, Kubiak is still figuring out what to do with the requests.\n\nSeahawks OC Klint Kubiak has gotten requests to interview for the Giants, Cardinals, Raiders and Falcons head coaching jobs, per source. His focus is on the playoffs, so he'll take a day or two and figure out a plan to balance all of it.\n\nSeattle is on a bye as the NFC's 1 seed.\n\n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) January 6, 2026\n\nBoth of Seattle's coordinators getting interview requests is a challenge the Seahawks will have to navigate during the bye week. Teams can often lose focus during this time if they are not careful, which often results in catastrophic losses. Seattle needs to find a way to balance everything, as Breer mentioned in the tweet above, in order to maximize this rare opportunity for a potential Super Bowl run.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Cleveland Browns request to interview Seattle Seahawks DC Aden Durde",

    "description": "Former Arizona Cardinals head coach will apparently get a look from New York.",
    "fullText": "Kliff Kingsbury is leaving his job as Washington Commanders offensive coordinator to “pursue other opportunities.” One of those opportunities is likely to be with the New York Giants, where Kingsbury is expected to interview for the team’s vacant head-coaching position.\n\nKingsbury was offensive coordinator with Washington the past two seasons. His parting with the Commanders was described as a mutual decision between Kingsbury and Washington head coach Dan Quinn.\n\nKingsbury was praised for his work with the Commanders during Jayden Daniels’ 2024 rookie season as Washington went to the playoffs and had one of the league’s better offenses. With Daniels suffering through an injury-plagued 2025, the Commanders won just five games and Kingsbury’s offense was not nearly as prolific.\n\nDaniels and other Commanders players are apparently not happy with Kingsbury’s exit.\n\nKingsbury was head coach of the Arizona Cardinals for four seasons, from 2019-2022. He compiled a 28-37-1 (.432 winning percentage). His best season was 2021, when the Cardinals went 11-6 and lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams.\n\nPrior to Arizona, Kingsbury went 35-40 (.467) in six seasons as head coach at Texas Tech.\n\nI discussed Kingsbury with David Harrison, Commanders insider for Locked on Commanders, recently. Harrison said he would “lean to the side of no,” when I asked him if he thought Kingsbury should be in the conversation for the Giants.\n\n“I think that to be fair, like I don’t get to see, and you know this obviously, but to those who don’t, I don’t get to see Cliff do his day-to-day job and and all those things and full interaction with the players. So there there’s got to be a big grain of salt taken with I think any media member’s opinion on whether or not a guy would be a good head coach,” Harrison said. “But just looking at some of the things I can look at, Cliff still seems to be a guy who is very much kind of stuck in his way.\n\n“Kliff Kingsbury at the end of the day when he feels the he has the excuse, when he feels he has the reason, he’s going to revert back to what he wants to do. It’s not really about what is best for my team. It’s not and and don’t me wrong, like he thinks it’s best for his team, right? I should I should definitely put that in there. It’s not like he’s saying, “I don’t care that that’s what’s best. I want to do what I want to do.” Like, he thinks it’s best for his team. But what he doesn’t have is the situational awareness to understand that like, ‘No, it’s not’.\n\n“… until the head man says, “Hey dude, this is what we’re going to do.” He’s not going to see it himself. And if I’m hiring a head coach, I need a guy that can see the picture for what it is, not see the confirmation bias, that he wants to tell himself that he’s right all the time. And I just don’t think that Cliff is there.”",

    "description": "If the US operation in Venezuela tells us anything, it’s that Washington is thinking past the shale boom and back to a more traditional playbook.",
    "fullText": "If the US operation in Venezuela tells us anything, it’s that Washington is thinking past the shale boom and back to a more traditional playbook: secure access to oil abroad when supply at home looks less assured.\n\nStart with the numbers. The US Energy Information Administration expects US crude output to dip slightly in 2026, after several years of growth. That’s not a collapse. But it matters politically because shale is a treadmill: production stability depends on constant reinvestment, which in turn depends on price. Top-tier shale sites can work at lower prices, but meaningfully higher prices are required to profitably drill new wells.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Venezuela looks like a long-term option the US doesn’t want to leave to rivals. Recent reporting around the crisis frames the push as one where US oil firms are being invited back into a country with the world’s largest stated reserves, but a degraded industry, an opportunity some analysts describe as a “poisoned chalice,” with extra-heavy Venezuelan supply requiring high prices and heavy upfront investment to scale.\n\nThat brings us to the uncomfortable inference: This is oil security dressed up as strategy. And it hints at a return to a familiar American pattern — political interference in petrostates — that felt less central in the 2014-2024 period when shale growth and surging exports reduced the urgency of “barrels at any cost.”\n\nOil has often been the subtext of US foreign policy. The 1953 coup in Iran followed the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The point is not that “one company did it,” but that energy interests and state power intertwine when strategic supply appears at stake.\n\nToday, the corporate “face” of the Venezuela file is Chevron, not because it “controls” US policy, but because it sits at the chokepoint. With sanctions and licensing, Chevron has effectively become a valve, a channel through which some Venezuelan crude can still reach the US.\n\nThere’s also a quieter, very practical reason Venezuela matters: refinery physics. US shale is mostly light sweet. Venezuela’s flagship exports are often heavy sour. These are not interchangeable. What Venezuela can do, quickly, is redirect heavy barrels back to US Gulf Coast refineries that are built to run them — exactly the kind of trade shift that also happens to reduce China’s access to discounted sanctioned crude. For Washington, that China angle is a bonus argument, not the core driver.\n\nBut let’s be clear-eyed about the limits. Venezuela’s oil is hard to produce. Even optimistic investment roadmaps talk in multiyear timelines. So anyone expecting a fast flood of supply is likely to be disappointed. Even the reserve story is not simple. Venezuela may top the charts on paper, but “proved reserves” are an economic classification as much as a geological one.\n\nThat’s the deeper point for markets: Supply growth is not just about claimed resources. It’s about prices, production technology, political stability, know-how, and logistics.\n\nIf all of this is telling us anything, it’s that higher oil prices in the future may be needed to offset decline dynamics in both shale and extra-heavy oil provinces like Venezuela. Washington may be trying to secure additional future supply to cap price spikes, but that won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick.\n\nOPEC in a Shale Oil World: Where to Next?\n\nThe “Donroe Doctrine” gives Washington control of nearly 40% of the world oil output, and with it the power to keep crude prices close to $50 a barrel, writes Bloomberg Opinion’s Javier Blas.",

    "description": "After President Donald Trump stunned the world by saying the US plans to “run” Venezuela, uncertainty over what that means and who is in charge loomed over the South American nation.  Ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was an indicted prisoner on a flight bound for New York by the time his Vice President Delcy Rodríguez — who Trump said would partner with Washington to “make Venezuela great again” — denounced the intervention as “barbaric” and a “kidnapping.” Adding to the confusion was that the White House offered few details about what running an oil-producing nation of about 30 million people would entail. Bloomberg News National Security Team Leader Nick Wadhams joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. He speaks with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec.",

    "description": "A hapless Donald Trump made a show of the Air Force One stairs as he stepped off the presidential jet after a two-week stay at his Mar-a-Lago bolthole.

    "fullText": "A hapless Donald Trump made a show of the Air Force One stairs as he stepped off the presidential jet after a two-week stay at his Mar-a-Lago bolthole.\n\nTrump arrived in Palm Beach County early on Dec. 20 for a 15-day stay and returned to Washington, D.C., via an airbase in Maryland on Sunday evening. But as he descended the steps of AF1 to board Marine One for his onward journey, several possible tell-tale signs of weakness became apparent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has dutifully reported on the waning physical power of the 79-year-old president, with major players such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal joining the conversation later. Trump admitted to the latter that he has sought medical help for a myriad of issues.\n\nIn that unusually candid interview last week, he conceded that he visited Walter Reed Military Medical Center in mid-July after suffering “mild swelling” in his lower legs and said an ultrasound showed he has “chronic venous insufficiency,” a common ailment in older people that makes it more difficult for the blood to travel to the heart from the legs through smaller veins.\n\nThis, perhaps, contributed to Trump making the relatively simple task of walking down some steps and then in a straight line, and then up some even smaller steps, look like a gargantuan effort.\n\nTV footage captured the charade. Trump is seen emerging from the door of the jet before gripping the handrail and appearing to let his legs drop abruptly onto the steps. He gingerly descends before pawing for a second handrail as his eyes remain fixed on the red carpet in front of him.\n\nHis hair comedically flaps in the wind as he takes on the second portion of the stairs, even slower than the first. He steps out onto the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews and takes a breather, saluting the gathered officials and waving to the press.\n\nHe then embarks on a long arc towards Marine One, where he veers wildly to the left of the door, stopping for chats along the way. The short walk, in which he also drags his right leg, takes what feels like an age. He appears jaded as he ascends the tiny staircase into the chopper, which brought him back to the White House.\n\nTrump has made a hash of the AF1 steps plenty of times in the past and more frequently of late. In a video showing such an instance from just before Christmas, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs cautiously.\n\nJust before the New Year, his old foe—steps—appeared to rankle him once more. The president cautiously climbed down the steps at the main entrance of his Mar-a-Lago estate as he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the Gaza peace plan.\n\nTrump glanced down at the short staircase before him as he waited for Netanyahu to come forward.\n\nTrump hasn’t been coy about his fear of stairs. In September, he admitted that he was wary of publicly stumbling and falling like his predecessor Joe Biden, who was 82 when he left the White House.\n\n“Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs,” Trump told military generals who were gathered in Quantico. “I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs, like these stairs—I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record. Just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well... Just walk nice and easy. You don’t have to set any record.”",

    "fullText": "Conference plays continue tonight with just one game as Washington heads east to Bloomington to face the Hoosiers.\n\nIndiana will try to win their third game in a row tonight against Washington. The Hoosiers opened the season with seven straight wins before an upset loss at Minnesota, followed by losses to Louisville and Kentucky. They did pick up a win against Penn State, putting them at 1-1 in league play heading into the season. While Indiana got off to a hot start it’s worth mentioning that they’ve yet to truly land a marquee win under new head coach Darian DeVries, with their best win coming against 9-5 Kansas State.\n\nWashington hasn’t made the jump many fans were hoping for in Danny Sprinkle’s second season with the team. While the Huskies did split their opening week in the Big Ten, with a win over ranked USC, Washington is only 9-4 and there loss two weeks ago to Seattle was not a positive sign. They desperately need a win here with a road game against Purdue on Wednesday followed by a four game stretch that includes three top 15 ranked teams in Michigan, Michigan State and Nebraska.\n\nIndiana hasn’t always been consistent, but the offensive production has been solid and they’ve fared better shooting outside than in years past. With four players averaging double figures, led by Lamar Wilkerson’s 19 points per game, Indiana’s offense is more than capable of scoring the ball. That should prove an advantage over a defensive focused Huskies program that is ranked 75th offensively per KenPom. Washington is shooting worse from the field (45.3%), three (32.2%) and commits more turnovers than Indiana.\n\nInjuries are also an issue tonight, with second leading Husky scorer Wesley Yates III out with a wrist injury suffered against Seattle. The guard was averaging 14.9 points per game and was a key contributor on the offensive side of the ball. Desmond Claude and Zoom Diallo are also averaging just north of 14 points per game and will be relied on more heavily down the stretch. Forward Hannes Steinbach has been key with 18.1 points and 12 rebounds per game. If Indiana can slow down the Huskies inside that will go a long way, especially with Washington’s guard not being the best perimeter shooters.\n\nHome court advantage is also going to be a big factor for a couple of reasons. Besides the fact that it’s hard to win on the road in the Big Ten and the difficulty of going into Assembly Hall, the Huskies face a notable disadvantage when it comes to the traveling required for whenever they hit the road. Last season Washington went 2-8 on the road in league play, with two wins against Minnesota and Penn State by a combined five points.\n\nBoth of these teams could use a win to get 2026 off to a strong start, especially with some of the looming questions heading into conference play. With tonight’s game being played in Bloomington and Indiana being more efficient on the offensive side of the ball the Hoosiers should be able to get their second Big Ten win of the season.",

    "fullText": "Texas Football has hired Georgia Tech defensive coordinator Blake Gideon to assist Will Muschamp running the Longhorns defense. Gideon, a four-year safety at Texas, played for Muschamp in Austin. He was the safeties coach for Steve Sarkisian until 2025, when he left for Atlanta.\n\nAfter running the defense for the Yellow Jackets this season, Gideon is returning to his alma mater. The 36-year-old played safety at Texas from 2008 through 2011. He got his first coaching role in 2014 and has climbed the career ladder for 11 years. Gideon served as the Longhorns’ safety coach for four seasons before accepting his first defensive coordinator position with Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech ended the season the 99th-ranked defense in FBS.\n\nIn December, Texas coach Steve Sarkisian parted ways with Pete Kwiatkowski and replaced him with Muschamp. Sark said in the announcement he'd like to spend less time worrying about the defense.\n\nGeorgia Tech defensive coordinator Blake Gideon is returning to Texas as an assistant for Steve Sarkisian and Will Muschamp, @InsideTexas' @EricNahlin has learned.\n\nGideon, who played 52 games for UT, was on Sarkisian's original staff from 2021-24\n\nSTORY (FREE):… pic.twitter.com/8PyEk451sJ\n\n— Inside Texas (@InsideTexas) January 2, 2026\n\n\"We just felt it was best for our program to move in a different direction, and having the opportunity to hire Will Muschamp provides us the leadership to take our defense to another level,\" Sark said in the press release. \"Will is a guy I've known for a long time, always admired and is as good of a defensive mind and coach as I've ever coached against. His defenses are relentless; he absolutely gets the best out of his staff and players and is such an extremely well-respected coach. I know Longhorn Nation knows him well, he led some incredible defenses here on the Forty, and I'm so fired up to be bringing him back to Texas. He'll be an awesome addition to our staff.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Longhorns Wire: Texas Football hires former Longhorn, Georgia Tech DC Blake Gideon",

    "description": "Colts veteran defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo should be no stranger to upcoming open head coaching interviews.",
    "fullText": "According to ESPN’s Jordan Raanan, Indianapolis Colts veteran defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo is among the initial top interview candidates for the New York Giants current head coaching vacancy:\n\n“The first assignment is to find a new head coach. The Giants fired Brian Daboll almost eight weeks ago and named Mike Kafka the interim head coach,” writes Ranaan.\n\n“The team had a head start on compiling a list of candidates that includes former NFL head coach Mike McCarthy, Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, former Raiders coach and Giants player Antonio Pierce and Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, among others. Kafka will also be given an interview.”\n\nWhoever is ultimately hired in New York will replace Brian Daboll, who coached the Giants from 2022-25.\n\nIt’s not the first time that Anarumo has been linked to an NFL head coaching opening, as he’s previously been connected in-season as a top candidate for the Tennessee Titans vacancy through multiple league reports respectively.\n\nNicknamed the “Mad Scientist,” the 59-year-old veteran defensive coordinator has been lauded for his ability to tailor his defensive gameplans weekly to stopping the opposing competition, even giving the likes of Kansas City Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes some trouble in the past among other elite quarterbacks.\n\nIn his debut campaign with the Colts, there’s no question that Anarumo has been a significant upgrade to his Colts veteran defensive coordinator predecessor Gus Bradley.\n\nWhen healthy and going right, the Colts had a formidable unit this season.\n\nThat being said, after losing arguably the defense’s three best players down the season’s late stretch due to key injuries, namely to DeForest Buckner, Sauce Gardner, and Charvarius Ward, the Colts defense has since fallen on some hard times to close out this season. It no longer recently resembles the Top 10 defensive unit that it was for the majority of the 2025 campaign because of the loss of its best players.\n\nIt’s hard to win on defense in the NFL without your horses. Much less, there’s personnel issues with the Colts lack of consistent outside pass rush that go beyond Anarumo and key injuries down the final stretch.\n\nAnarumo has paid his coaching dues, has a track record of success, and is deserving of strong consideration for any NFL head coaching opening this upcoming offseason. However, it would be a real shame if he only gets to coach the Colts defense for one season. To me, he’s a top candidate to return in Indianapolis as defensive coordinator even in the rare case that Colts head coach Shane Steichen surprisingly doesn’t.\n\nGiven that we really didn’t see this unit fully together healthy upon Gardner’s arrival, Anarumo’s coaching best is still theoretically yet to come in Indianapolis—if we even get to see it again.",

    "fullText": "Are we in the middle of an AI bubble? Ask a lawmaker, and they probably won't have a definitive take for you.\n\n\"If I knew that, I'd be in a different line of work,\" Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents much of Silicon Valley, told Business Insider in November.\n\nThe AI bubble debate has been raging in the tech world since August, when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that investors had grown \"overexcited\" about the technology.\n\nThere are also concerns about circular spending patterns among tech companies investing in AI technology, and fears that companies won't be able to recoup the billions of dollars they're spending on data centers and other AI infrastructure. Bill Gates has explicitly compared it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.\n\nThose concerns have made their way to Wall Street, with stock prices of major tech companies beginning to wobble.\n\nHowever, many in the tech world remain confident that there's no bubble, citing continued high demand for AI products.\n\n\"Are we in an AI bubble? I have no idea,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told Business Insider in November. \"Even the AI people don't know.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said that while she was unsure whether there's a bubble, she's concerned by \"how much of the economic activity in the stock market and across the country is driven by this one sector.\"\n\n\"If it is overvalued, when that bubble pops, it's going to be felt everywhere,\" Warren said. \"The concentration makes the economy far more vulnerable than it otherwise would be.\"\n\nOne of the few lawmakers who's been outspoken about the potential for a bubble is Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who said at a hearing in November that we may be in a \"massive economic bubble\" that could pose \"2008-style threats to economic stability.\"\n\n\"Should this bubble pop, we should not be entertaining a bailout,\" Ocasio-Cortez added. \"We should not entertain a bailout of these corporations, as healthcare is being denied to everyday Americans, as SNAP and food assistance is being denied to everyday Americans, precipitating some of the very mental crises that people are turning to AI chatbots to try to resolve in themselves.\"\n\nThe debate began making its way to Capitol Hill as the Trump administration and some Republicans in Congress look for ways to make it easier for the AI industry to do business.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, when asked, has largely shrugged off questions about whether he's worried about a bubble.\n\n\"I guess. I worry about everything,\" Trump said in an interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes\" earlier this month. \"I hope it's gonna be very good. But if it's not so good, we're protected.\"\n\nTrump signed an executive order in December aiming at restricting the ability of states to regulate AI, tasking the Department of Justice with suing states that have \"onerous\" AI laws on the books.\n\nThat executive order is likely to see legal challenges, and it's ultimately less strong than a law passed by Congress would have been. But Republicans have been at odds with one another over the policy, beginning over the summer as Congress considered the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nThat bill originally included a provision that would have blocked states from enacting some regulations on AI for 10 years. It was strongly supported by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee who's positioned himself as an ally of the AI industry on Capitol Hill. It was later stripped out of the megabill in a 99-1 vote.\n\nWhen asked last week whether he sees a bubble in the AI industry, Cruz was circumspect.\n\n\"Will there be uncertainty? Will there be economic challenges? Of course,\" Cruz told Business Insider. \"But for technology of this magnitude, it's in our interest that America win the race, and not China.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez argued that there's a connection between the potential bubble and financial incentives to make AI technology more exploitative.\n\n\"People's deepest fears, secrets, emotional content, relationships can all be mined for this empty promise that we're getting from these companies to turn a profit,\" Ocasio-Cortez said at the November hearing.\n\nOther lawmakers have also raised concerns. In November, Democratic Rep. Bill Foster of Illinois led a group of 21 lawmakers on a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asking his agency to evaluate the risks of AI investment in light of concerns about a bubble.\n\nBut for some of those who want to see stronger regulation of AI, the question of a bubble is largely beside the point.\n\n\"Bubble, no bubble, whatever,\" Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said. \"We need to focus on the effect on working people.\"",

    "title": "Michigan's Kyle Whittingham reportedly turns to former Utah assistants to be Wolverines' new coordinators",
    "description": "Whittingham hired OC Jason Beck ahead of the 2025 season and BYU DC Jay Hill was a longtime Utah assistant.",
    "fullText": "New Michigan coach Kyle Whittingham is hiring familiar faces as his top two assistants.\n\nAccording to ESPN, BYU defensive coordinator Jay Hill is set to take the same position with the Wolverines and Utah offensive coordinator Jason Beck will be the team’s offensive coordinator. Both Hill and Beck had been prominently mentioned as Whittingham's top choices ever since the former Utah coach was named the replacement for the fired Sherrone Moore.\n\nLike Beck, Hill has ties to Utah, where Whittingham was the second-longest tenured coach in college football before stepping down at the end of the season. Hill, who just finished his third season as BYU’s defensive coordinator, was an assistant for the Utes from 2001 through 2013. He coached positions on both offense and defense for the Utes before he became the head coach at Weber State from 2014 through 2022.\n\nBYU’s defense has been one of the most reliable units in the country over the past two seasons. After a rough first year in the Big 12, the Cougars have allowed fewer than 20 points per game in each of the last two seasons. Texas Tech was the only team to score more than 27 points against BYU all season in 2025.\n\nBeck was at Utah for just one season after arriving from New Mexico after the 2024 season. Whittingham turned to Beck — and, subsequently, former UNM QB Devon Dampier — after a rough offensive season in 2024 that featured four quarterbacks seeing significant playing time.\n\nThe Utes averaged 6.6 yards per play and scored over 41 points per game in 2025. Only four teams averaged more points per game. Dampier, who threw for over 2,000 yards and rushed for over 1,000 in 2024 at New Mexico, had nearly 2,500 passing yards in 2025 while rushing for 835 yards.

    "fullText": "The billionaire – who had no government experience – left various federal agencies in disarray while overseeing an ‘efficiency’ drive across Washington\n\nAs Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, splurged more than $250m on Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign, the US president commissioned his new ally to oversee a sweeping “efficiency” drive across the federal government.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss, who had no experience inside government, was tasked with eradicating waste and cutting spending as part of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – and was quick to stoke expectations.\n\n“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk declared of the potential savings during a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City a week before Trump’s re-election.\n\nFollowing Trump’s return to office in January, these ambitious plans were swiftly on a collision course with reality. Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired, leaving agencies in disarray and triggering myriad legal challenges.\n\nJust four months into the administration, Musk abruptly announced his exit. Six months later, it was reported that Doge was no more. Musk has even said he wouldn’t do it again.\n\n“That was all complete bullshit from the beginning,” Elaine Kamarck, a former White House official and expert on government reform, told the Guardian. “The fact that they even said it and then had to go roll it way, way, way back into the low hundreds of billions, tells you they didn’t know what they were doing.”\n\nKamarck created and managed the National Performance Review, which aimed to improve efficiency and reduce costs, during the Clinton administration.\n\nAs of December, the agency’s purported savings, which reports have demonstrated are rife with errors, inaccuracies, and exaggerations, have reached $214bn.\n\nHowever much has been cut from the federal budget, the urgency surrounding Doge in its early weeks and months prompted widespread disruption, and even mistakes. Analysis by the Brookings Institution recorded 26,511 occasions where the Trump administration fired people, and then hired them back.\n\n“What they did was they sowed chaos to no avail,” said Kamarck. “Doge was done in an incredibly careless way, without regard for what the agencies did and whether and moreover, whether or not Americans liked what they did.\n\n“You can cut the government. I did it in the Clinton administration,” she added. “We cut the government by 420,000 people, but we did it over a period of seven years, and we did it in the context of mission and what we no longer needed to do, etc.\n\n“In other words, we had a plan that works with the mission of the agency. This business of coming in and moving fast and breaking things which they like to do in Silicon Valley just doesn’t work in the government.”\n\nQuestions were raised last month about whether Doge was even still operating. “That doesn’t exist,” the office of personnel management (OPM) director, Scott Kupor, told Reuters. (An account for the agency on X, formerly Twitter, disputed this claim.)\n\nBut Musk had long moved on. During a recent podcast interview with former Doge adviser Katie Miller, the tycoon described the effort he once suggested could identify $2tn in savings for the federal government as “a little bit successful”. Asked if he would do it again, he responded: “I don’t think so ... Instead of doing Doge, I would have, basically, built … worked on my companies.”\n\nHow much efficiency can be achieved from having multiple operations inside the federal government, seeking efficiencies? Philip G Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said Doge was “unnecessary” given the longstanding existence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which has logged $1.45tn in savings across over 29,000 federal operations since 2002.\n\nRussell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director and architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint, said in September that he believes the GAO shouldn’t exist.\n\n“I can understand why he thinks that,” said Joyce. “Because the Government Accountability Office, as an agency of the Congress, is helping the Congress to try to hold the executive branch accountable. It’s uncomfortable to be held accountable, but that doesn’t make it bad.”\n\nRather than reinforce the balance of power between the different branches of government, Joyce argued that Doge was a mechanism to eliminate and cut things the government does that are ideologically opposed by the Trump administration – without congressional approval.\n\n“What Doge was doing was not trying to take the operations of government and make it more efficient. They were basically just trying to come in and almost randomly sort of decide that they were going to just eliminate a significant number of things that the government does,” he said. “Even upfront, it was clear that they had really no understanding of the federal budget. And then when they went into the agencies, it became even clearer.”\n\nWhen Doge descended on the Social Security Administration in February, Chuck Borges was serving as chief data officer. Musk was touting false and misleading claims alleging fraud and abuse at the agency, including claims people over 120 years old were still receiving benefits.\n\nBorges resigned in August, and filed a whistleblower complaint over how Doge left the public’s social security data exposed. “What I identified was that social security data was apparently being copied into an insecure or unsecured cloud environment, or you could characterize it as a cloud environment without independent security monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “What I was alleging was that there was a risk being put on the data by keeping it in a manner not consistent with agency policy, agency requirements and industry best practices.”\n\nBorges is now running for a state senate seat in Maryland. “I believe that if we don’t find a way to build strong, sustainable, growing communities locally, and I’d like to start with where I live, then the nation isn’t going to have a lot of seeds which it can use to grow and recover from where we are today,” he said.\n\nMany Doge staffers are now reportedly embedded inside federal agencies across government. Many of the issues it posed around transparency, and the impact of sweeping decisions, are still being fought over in court.\n\n“Doge has been operating with minimal transparency but maximal authority,” said Donald K Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Doge in February, alleging that it had failed to comply with recordkeeping and transparency laws.\n\n“There’s pretty significant misalignment in terms of how the administration claims Doge has been beneficial to the American public, and what information it wants the American public to have access to about Doge’s operations,” said Sherman. “We’ve spent months litigating because this administration does not want the public to know what Doge is doing, how Doge is operating.”\n\nApproached for comment, the White House did not provide detailed responses to questions on Doge’s record.\n\n“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said spokesperson Davis Ingle.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "Sunday’s 42-38 shootout loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday marked the first time in 12 years that the Chicago Bears lost when scoring at least 38 points. The last such loss came in a 45-41 loss to Washington on Oct. 20, 2013. Before that it hadn’t happened since 1958, according to Stathead.

    "fullText": "Sunday’s 42-38 shootout loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday marked the first time in 12 years that the Chicago Bears lost when scoring at least 38 points.\n\nThe last such loss came in a 45-41 loss to Washington on Oct. 20, 2013. Before that it hadn’t happened since 1958, according to Stathead.\n\nHere are the other numbers, stats and figures that stood out this week for the Bears.\n\nThe simplest scenario for the Bears is to beat the Detroit Lions on Sunday and clinch the No. 2 seed in the NFC. Even if Philadelphia beats Washington, which would give the Bears and Eagles the same record, the Bears hold the head-to-head tiebreaker. That would mean a matchup with the Green Bay Packers, who are locked in as the No. 7 seed.\n\nIf the Lions beat the Bears and the Eagles beat the Commanders, the Bears would drop to the No. 3 seed and face either the 49ers or Los Angeles Rams as the No. 6 seed.\n\nIf the Seahawks beat the 49ers in Saturday night’s battle for the No. 1 seed, the 49ers will remain in a wild-card spot. If the Rams then beat the 3-13 Arizona Cardinals, the 49ers and Rams would have the same record and Los Angeles would win the tiebreaker and earn the No. 5 seed — landing the Bears a rematch against the 49ers.\n\nIf the 49ers beat the Seahawks, San Francisco would earn the No. 1 seed and Seattle would fall to a wild-card spot. The Seahawks still would have a better record than the Rams no matter what the Rams do in Week 18, so Seattle would be the No. 5 seed and Los Angeles the No. 6.\n\nThe Rams also would be the No. 6 seed if they lose to the Cardinals, regardless of what happens between the Seahawks and 49ers.\n\nBears coach Ben Johnson already said his team is “playing to win” in Week 18.\n\nThe Bears no longer can earn the No. 1 seed and home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. The No. 2 seed, however, would guarantee them a home game not only in the wild-card round, but also in the divisional round should they advance.\n\n“Playing at Soldier Field is absolutely one of the things that we wanted to do in the playoffs,” linebacker T.J. Edwards said.\n\nSince 1920, according to Stathead, the Bears are 12-9 in the postseason when playing at home.\n\nOn the road — which they’ve done only once since 1995 (2020 versus the New Orleans Saints) — the Bears are 4-10 all time. They haven’t won a road playoff game since 1995 and haven’t won any playoff game since the 2010 season.\n\nWilliams has 3,730 passing yards through 16 games with 25 touchdown passes and six interceptions.\n\nHe’s 109 yards shy of breaking Erik Kramer’s franchise passing record of 3,838 yards in 1995. Williams’ season low is 154 yards against the Eagles.\n\nHe’s also 270 yards shy of becoming the first Bears quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards in a season. The Bears are the only NFL franchise that never has had a 4,000-yard passer.\n\nWilliams has thrown for 270 yards or \n\nThe Detroit defense is surrendering 218.1 passing yards per game (ranked 19th), and the Lions have dealt with some significant injuries on defense. Before Christmas Day, when former third-stringer Max Brosmer and the Minnesota Vikings totaled 3 net passing yards, the Lions had given up 313.2 per game over their previous five games.\n\nIt’s not out of the question that Williams could reach 4,000 yards, but it would take one of his biggest games of the season.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Kramer also holds the Bears single-season record with 29 touchdown passes in 1995. Williams needs four to tie it. His 25 TD passes currently ranks fifth in franchise history.\n\nAll of those passing yards have to go somewhere. After big games Sunday night, wide receiver Luther Burden III and tight end Colston Loveland both surpassed 600 receiving yards on the season.\n\nThe Bears now have four pass catchers with at least 600 yards: DJ Moore (671 yards), Rome Odunze (661), Loveland (622) and Burden (617). The rookies Burden and Loveland have come on strong late in the season. Odunze was leading the pack before a foot injury sidelined him the last four games.\n\nThis is the first time since 2014 that the Bears have had four players with 600 or more receiving yards in the same season. Alshon Jeffery (1,133), Martellus Bennett (916), Matt Forte (808) and Brandon Marshall (721) did it that season, when Jay Cutler threw for 3,812 yards, second in franchise history. The Bears finished 5-11 and fired coach Marc Trestman.\n\nAccording to Stathead, the 2025 and 2014 seasons are the only instances in Bears history that four players totaled at least 600 receiving yards.\n\nHow the Bears would feed all of these playmakers was one of the stories of the summer. The answer, it seems, is that each has had his moment. The distribution has been remarkably even across the board.\n\nMoore leads the Bears with 49 receptions. Odunze, who hasn’t played since Nov. 28 in Philadelphia, still leads the team with 90 targets.\n\nThe Bears have scored 30 points or \n\nWith 54 rushing yards against San Francisco, D’Andre Swift passed 1,000 yards for the second time in his career. At 1,047, he’s 2 yards shy of his career high.\n\nThe Bears lead the NFL with 32 takeaways. The Jacksonville Jaguars, with 30, are probably the only team that can catch them in Week 18. The Bears are also best in the NFL with only 10 turnovers. The Houston Texans are next-best with 12.\n\nPer the Bears, left guard Joe Thuney tied an NFL record for most regular-season starts in his first 10 seasons with his 162nd last week. With a start in Week 18, Thuney would pass Atlanta Falcons tackle Jake Matthews, who also started 162 games in his first 10 years. Thuney has missed only two regular-season games in his career, both in 2022 with the Kansas City Chiefs. He already holds the record for combined regular-season and playoff starts over his first 10 years with 183.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — CAPITALS 6, RANGERS 3\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Tom Wilson had two goals and an assist to lead Washington past New York.\n\nWilson, who earlier in the day was named a member of Canada’s Olympic roster, got into a fight with Sam Carrick in the second period for at least his second Gordie Howe hat trick — a goal, an assist and a fight — since March 3, 2025.\n\nJustin Sourdif also had two goals and Anthony Beauvillier and Aliaksei Protas each scored for the Capitals, who have won two of the last three games.\n\nAdam Fox, making his return from long-term injured reserve, had a goal and an assist for the Rangers, who have lost three straight. Vincent Trocheck and Braden Schneider also scored.\n\nWith the Capitals tied 1-1 and needing a spark in the second, Wilson rose to the occasion. The 28-year-old came streaking up ice and leveled Noah Laba before getting to the front of the net and roofing a feed from Connor McMichael to restore Washington’s lead as he became the first Capital to hit the 20-goal mark this season. Minutes later, he answered for Laba’s hit, fighting Carrick.\n\nThe fight, initiated by Carrick, put the Capitals on the power play. Sourdif snuck a loose puck past Jonathan Quick, who had 21 saves, to end a 16-game goal drought to make it 3-1.\n\nFox responded with a power-play goal of his own soon after to pull things to 3-2 going into the third.\n\nProtas and Wilson, netting his 200th career goal, added insurance tallies late to cushion the lead.\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) — Steven Stamkos scored his 600th career goal and Nashville beat the Vegas.\n\nThe Predators, in the middle of a season-long seven-game road trip, won for the 12th time in 17 games, including the third of their first four on the trip.\n\nThe win put the Predators (18-17-4) above .500 for the first time since Oct. 16, just five games into the season, when they were 2-1-2.\n\nVegas, meanwhile, lost for the sixth time in seven games. The Knights closed their four-game homestand with a 1-2-1 mark.\n\nNow in his 18th season, Stamkos scored his 18th of the season and ninth against the Golden Knights since they entered the league in 2017. The game-tying goal was part of an unanswered three-goal spurt over five minutes that turned a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 lead for the Predators.\n\nNick Perbix, Reid Schaefer and Michael Bunting also scored for the Predators. Justus Annunen made 29 saves.\n\nFormer Knight Erik Haula, who is two games shy of skating in his 800th game, registered the 200th assist of his career on Bunting’s goal.\n\nMark Stone, who earlier in the day was named to Canada’s Olympic roster, scored his 10th goal of the season, while Ben Hutton added his sixth for the Knights. Akira Schmid stopped 15 shots before being pulled late in the third period for an extra skater.\n\nVegas forward Mitch Marner and defenseman Shea Theodore were also named to Canada’s team. All three of the Knights represented their homeland in the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off.\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Darren Raddysh scored midway through overtime, and Tampa Bay blew three one-goal leads before beating Anaheim for its fifth consecutive victory.\n\nTampa Bay coach Jon Cooper celebrated his 1,000th regular-season game in charge with his 595th victory as the longest-tenured bench boss in the NHL. The Lightning’s coach since March 2013 has also led them in 155 playoff games, won two championships and reached four Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nNikita Kucherov had a goal and an assist as the Lightning skated off with a win in the opener of their three-game California road trip when Raddysh converted a pass from Brandon Hagel, who had three assists.\n\nJ.J. Moser and Brayden Point also scored for Tampa Bay, and Andrei Vasilevskiy made 24 saves.\n\nMason McTavish tied it on a power play with 6:58 left in regulation for the Ducks, who have lost four straight and eight of 10. Jansen Harkins and Beckett Sennecke also scored, and Lukas Dostal stopped 24 shots as the Ducks earned a point for only the second time in six games.\n\nMoser opened the scoring in the first period with his first goal since agreeing to an eight-year, $54 million contract extension last weekend.\n\nAnaheim scored its first two goals off turnovers, with the 19-year-old Sennecke getting the 12th of his rookie season early in the third period.\n\nKucherov scored his 18th goal on a cross-ice pass from Hagel during a power play four minutes later, but the Ducks evened it again when Pavel Mintyukov made an exceptional play at the blue line to set up McTavish for his 10th goal.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Macklin Celebrini had a goal and an assist hours after being selected to play for Team Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics, and San Jose beat Minnesota in a shootout.\n\nCelebrini and William Eklund scored for the Sharks in the tiebreaker, while Minnesota failed to convert on either of its two attempts. San Jose has won three straight following a three-game slide.\n\nIgor Chernyshov had a goal and two assists, and Jeff Skinner also scored for the Sharks.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has ended the lease agreement for three public golf courses in Washington, a move that offers President Donald Trump an additional opportunity to put his stamp on another piece of the nation's capital.\n\nThe National Links Trust, the nonprofit that has operated Washington's three public courses on federal land for the last five years, said Wednesday that the Department of the Interior had terminated its 50-year lease agreement. The Interior Department said it was terminating the lease because the nonprofit had not implemented required capital improvements and failed to meet the terms of the lease.\n\nWhile it was unclear what the Trump administration's plans are for the golf courses, the move gives Trump, whose private company has developed numerous golf courses in the U.S. and abroad, the chance to remake links overlooking the Potomac River and in Rock Creek Park and a site that is part of Black golf history.\n\nOfficials for the National Links Trust said in a statement that they were “devastated” by the decision to terminate the lease and defended their management of the courses. They said $8.5 million had gone toward capital improvements at the courses and that rounds played and revenue had more than doubled in their tenure managing the courses. The nonprofit has agreed to keep managing the courses for the time being, but long-term renovations will stop.\n\n“While this termination is a major setback, we remain stubbornly hopeful that a path forward can be found that preserves affordable and accessible public golf in the nation’s capital for generations to come,” the officials added.\n\nThe Department of the Interior's decision comes as Trump rebrands civic spaces in Washington and deploys National Guard members to the streets for public safety. The Kennedy Center added Trump's name this month after the center's board of trustees — made up of Trump appointees — voted to change the name of the performing arts space designated by Congress as a memorial to John F. Kennedy. Trump is also in the midst of a construction project to build a ballroom on the White House's East Wing, and he has put his name on the U.S. Institute of Peace.",

    "fullText": "How the tech CEO and ‘Dogefather’ made a mess of the year – from an apparent Nazi salute during his White House tenure to Tesla sales slumps and Starship explosions\n\nThe year of 2025 was dizzying for Elon Musk. The tech titan began the year holding court with Donald Trump in Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Musk appeared to give a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration, staunchly championed a 19-year-old staffer nicknamed “Big Balls,” denied reports of being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conference with a black eye – all in the first half of the year alone.\n\n“Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, told Vanity Fair in an expansive interview earlier this month. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china.”\n\nMusk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormous government contracts and expand SpaceX’s operations. With Tesla, he was approved for a pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire even as the company’s global sales plunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some $600bn.\n\nIn the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clair sued Musk in February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regular attacks in posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is trans, was featured in New York magazine and modeled at New York fashion week. And the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.\n\nThe relationship that dominated Musk’s public life, however, was his friendship and falling out with Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump had broken up. Their bromance burned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musk lashed out at the president on his social media platform, X, saying: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” The post has since been deleted.\n\nThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought to advance his rightwing agenda and grow his tech empire.\n\nWhile Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire was invited back in November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.\n\n“Well, I really don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I like Elon a lot.”\n\nMusk expressed more regret than the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: “Instead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nAfter becoming a Republican mega-donor and campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set a tone of chaos and outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.\n\nDuring Trump’s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Musk issued what many people interpreted as back-to-back fascist-syle salutes as he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as “dirty tricks” from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla owners sold their cars in response to Musk’s gestures.\n\nMusk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups after appearing virtually at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEO told the crowd via livestream that Germans should not focus on “past guilt” and “move beyond that” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved to gut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs across the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk’s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personally bragged about feeding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, “into the woodchipper”. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions and result in children starving to death in a hunger crisis that experts agree was needless.\n\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration’s demolition man. He brandished a chainsaw on stage and told the audience “I am become meme!” as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began to pour more money into Republican causes by holding rallies and handing out $1m checks to support a conservative judge in Wisconsin’s supreme court race.\n\nThe pushback against Musk’s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges that ruled Doge’s activities illegal or issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, who called for the widespread impeachment of any “activist judges” who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court race lost by a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk’s presence had potentially become politically toxic.\n\nMusk left his role in the White House in May amid disputes around his pick for who would head Nasa and clashes over Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he would reduce his campaign finance contributions in the future and return to his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with his public battle with Trump on social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the “America party,” a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.\n\nMusk’s political leanings continued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and telling Joe Rogan that “it should be OK to have white pride”. He led an online grievance campaign in early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country’s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it “hates Christians” and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.\n\nThe year in Musk’s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.\n\nUnlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which he bought for a second time this year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there’s Tesla, his electric car company.\n\nOf all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as people enraged by Musk’s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker’s showrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing “Tesla Takedown” events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: “Burn your swastikar before it burns you.” Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide were set on fire as one-off vandals protested the billionaire.\n\nThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to a Tesla sales event on the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw its sales slump worldwide.\n\nLawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida jury awarded more than $200m to victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California, two separate lawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also opened several investigations into the carmaker over safety issues.\n\nWhile Tesla’s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn’t stop the company’s shareholders from approving a pay package for Musk – the largest corporate payout in history – that could catapult him to the status of the world’s first trillionaire.\n\nTesla’s year finished with a blow from California’s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn’t “remedy the situation” within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.\n\nWith SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth’s atmosphere – the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit – but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company’s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.\n\nMusk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.\n\nxAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about “white genocide”, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk’s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP.\n\nNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk’s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.\n\nThroughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk’s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X’s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the “Optimus” robot project and several leaders of the company’s various car divisions.\n\nMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.\n\nMusk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was “complicit in the rape of Britain” in one of his anti-immigration tirades.\n\nAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him “Sean Dummy” on X amid a string of other insults.\n\nEven Musk and Trump’s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla’s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill’s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk’s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had “lost his mind”.\n\nThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO’s time as self-described “first buddy” to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump’s side that he was on the campaign trail.\n\nMusk’s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman’s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk’s “pattern of harassment” against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.\n\nOne of Musk’s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source – famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views.\n\n“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates – scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,” Oates posted in November.\n\nA day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates’s critique.\n\n“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean,” Musk posted. “Not a good human.”",

    "fullText": "The Washington State Cougar fans showed up in droves to support their team in Seattle, making up a majority of the fans in attendance, but left with their heads hanging low as the Seattle Redhawks defended their city in a 69-55 win.\n\nWSU (6-9 overall, 1-1 in conference play) could never overcome their disastrous offensive first half. In the first 20 minutes of play, the Cougars scored just .688 points per possession and turned the ball over 11 times. While they were able to bounce back for a better second half, their efforts weren’t enough to match SU (12-3, 1-1).\n\nOpportunities were aplenty for WSU. They rebounded extremely well, hauling in 49% of their misses for offensive rebounds and limiting the Redhawks to grabbing just 6.5% of their own misses. WSU also got to the line a decent amount but finished only cashing 56.5% of their foul shots.\n\nAfter a brief series of turnovers and missed shots in the first three minutes, Tomas Thrastarson opened the scoring up with a little floater. On the defensive end, the Cougars kept the Redhawks silent through the first media timeout, not allowing a point until Will Heimbrodt’s layup 4:28 into the game.\n\nThe Cougars controlled things down low early. N.D. Okafor patrolled the post defensively, swatting away a pair of shots within the first five minutes. Offensively, the Cougars were all over the offensive glass, grabbing five offensive rebounds early. Despite their presence down low, WSU wasn’t able to convert their early O-boards into points. While able to grab 13 offensive rebounds in the first half, they only converted that into three points.\n\nWSU’s rebounding and defensive efforts were sound, but the offense struggled to find any sort of rhythm after those early makes. A miserable 32.4% turnover rate, combined with an even worse 21.9% shooting from the floor in the first half from WSU, allowed the Redhawks to rally from their own early offensive woes. The Cougars’ early five-point edge quickly vanished as the Redhawks put together mini runs of six, five, four, and eight to match any of the Cougar buckets on the other side of the floor.\n\nThe Redhawks great first half peaked when Brayden Maldonado splashed an open corner three at the buzzer to send Seattle into halftime up 14 points.\n\nWhile the Cougars missed some early chances to gain momentum at the free-throw line, they were still able to cut the deficit to five and finally seize that coveted momentum. Ace Glass was a big factor for the momentum swing, hitting a pair of threes that revived the Cougars’ chances. But those early missed opportunities at the charity stripe and missed open three-pointers loomed large as the Redhawks countered with a 5-0 run to push the lead back into double digits.\n\nThe Cougars finally found their best chance after the under-eight-minute media timeout. Okafor got things going with a putback layup that was followed up with a fast-break layup from Jerone Morton to cut the lead to single digits. After a Redhawk turnover, Glass converted a pair of free throws to bring the deficit to six, which started to bring the Cougar faithful in attendance to life. Okafor capped the run he started with another paint bucket that sent the Cougar fans into a frenzy. Suddenly, as Seattle set up their offense, Climate Pledge Arena sounded like Beasley Coliseum.\n\nThe Redhawks quickly shut up the Cougars with a three-pointer from Maleek Arington, and despite three chances on the other end off of offensive rebounds, the Cougars came away empty. Seattle continued their run with a trio of free throws to push the lead right back up to double digits. Maldonado once again came up clutch with a dagger corner three over Glass. The Redhawk fans reveled and waved goodbye to the Cougar fans making their way for the exits shortly after.\n\nThe first half showcased the worst of this Cougar basketball team. Seemingly endless turnovers and a lack of sharpshooting negated the dominance WSU had in the rebounding effort. By the time they were able to correct some things and find a bit of an offensive groove in the second half, it wasn’t nearly enough to match Seattle. WSU finished with 0.797 points per possession, shooting 29.7% from the floor and 14.8% from beyond the arc. They had ample opportunities to score with 25 offensive rebounds but only converted that into 14 second-chance points. From just a second-chance perspective, they scored just 0.560 points per possession. They also couldn’t convert their opportunities at the free-throw line, hitting only 13-23.\n\nThe Redhawks weren’t exactly burning the nets offensively either. They finished with 1.078 points per possession but also did that while grabbing only two offensive rebounds all night. WSU dominated the glass from the jump and still lost by 14. Tomas Thrastarson also did not play in the second half with what David Riley said was an injury.\n\nThis isn’t a bad loss by any means. This is one of Chris Victor’s best teams he’s put together at Seattle. They will be making a lot of noise in the WCC. But with how many opportunities and open looks the Cougars generated, this one stings for a WSU team looking to snag a win away from home.\n\nWSU will return home to host Loyola Marymount on Friday and Oregon State on Sunday.",

    "fullText": "A veteran Washington State Patrol trooper claims he’s faced discrimination and hostility in the agency due to his sexual orientation — issues that reportedly reached a breaking point when WSP personnel created and circulated a demeaning video of him generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nCollin Overend Pearson, who’s a Pierce County resident and gay, alleges that he’s been subjected to “repeated instances of discriminatory and unconstitutional conduct by WSP and its officers” during nearly two decades of employment, according to a lawsuit filed Dec. 19 in Pierce County Superior Court.\n\nThe conduct has damaged his reputation, the complaint said.\n\nIn a statement Monday, WSP spokesperson Chris Loftis declined to comment on the allegations, citing the agency’s policy and practice regarding pending litigation.\n\n“The Washington State Patrol believes that all employees have the right to work in an environment where skills, abilities, and dignity are valued and that is free from bias, harassment, and intimidation,” Loftis said.\n\nPearson is assigned to WSP’s District 1, which covers Pierce and Thurston counties, according to attorney Mark Conrad, who’s representing Pearson.\n\nPrior to suing the state, which allegedly failed to take appropriate actions to curb the discrimination and hostility, Pearson filed a legal claim against it late last year that served as a notice for it to put an end to the bad behavior, Conrad said in an interview Monday.\n\n“Instead of stopping, the conduct escalated,” Conrad said.\n\nIn December, WSP personnel created an AI-generated video that depicted Pearson and another uniformed, male trooper kissing on a roadside, the lawsuit claims. A voiceover in the video states, “this is SWAT training, no homo,” — using a derogatory phrase that insinuates “homosexuality is inferior or insulting,” according to the suit.\n\nConrad said the video was circulated among troopers and appears real, which is what he believes makes it so damaging beyond it being plainly derogatory and intended to humiliate his client. The deepfake also showed that at least some WSP personnel feel emboldened to engage in conduct demeaning to LGBTQ+ employees, he said.\n\nIt was the last straw for Pearson, according to Conrad, who said his client had put much thought into a “very difficult” decision to sue. The lawsuit accuses the state, by and through the WSP, of discrimination, retaliation and invasion of privacy, and it seeks unspecified damages to be proven at trial as well as legal fees.\n\nDespite the personal nature of the claims within the complaint, it was important to Pearson that he step forward, including by using his full name and not just his initials in the public filing, “to ensure that other people don’t have to face the environment that he’s currently facing,” Conrad said.\n\n“This can’t be tolerated in the workplace,” he said.\n\nThe lawsuit cites other alleged instances of discrimination, including when Pearson’s job offer in Des Moines was rescinded after a WSP captain advised the chief of that police department against hiring him, and when WSP detectives investigated an anonymous complaint that accused Pearson of threatening patrons while working off-duty at a Tacoma gay bar.\n\nPearson never worked at the bar, according to Conrad, and the suit said the complainant’s claim against Pearson was deemed to be unfounded. Conrad said he didn’t know the reason why the WSP captain had interfered in Pearson’s career move, nor did he know the status of an internal complaint that Pearson had filed in response.\n\nIn one instance, when Pearson inadvertently missed work, the WSP reacted more strongly than it did in similar situations involving other troopers, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPearson had been out sick for two days in December 2023 and overslept for a shift after his phone died. He didn’t notify his supervisor that he would miss work. A trooper was dispatched to Pearson’s home, where a man who was staying with Pearson answered the door and Pearson was awoken and interrogated by the trooper, according to the suit. Later that day, WSP personnel sent Ruston Police Department officers to conduct an additional check at the home, the suit said.\n\nThe missed workday prompted a formal months-long WSP investigation that involved outside agencies and included interviews with Pearson’s colleagues and scrutiny of his personal life, according to the suit. Ultimately, it was recommended Pearson be suspended for five days without pay for violations of “neglect of duty” and “use of alcohol — off duty,” the suit said.\n\nDuring a hearing on the matter, Washington State Patrol Troopers Association president Spike Unruh objected to the latter violation, arguing that WSP had unlawfully entered Pearson’s home without his consent, according to the suit.\n\n“Unruh also presented evidence that numerous troopers had previously overslept and were not subjected to home entry or similar treatment, and that it was not standard practice to involve outside agencies or conduct multiple home visits when a trooper failed to show for one workday,” the suit said.\n\nThe WSP’s probe “had effectively ‘outed’ Plaintiff’s sexuality to the entire (Office of Professional Standards) section, further compounding the emotional toll of the situation,” the suit said.\n\nIn August 2024, the WSP acknowledged that the entry into Pearson’s home was illegal and that no information obtained during that entry could be used against him, according to the suit, which said that the agency reclassified the off-duty alcohol violation as “undetermined.”",

So we have a lot of options at our disposal relative to that from a strategy perspective and certainly given six or seven days to prepare, I don’t think it’ll be a strategic issue in terms of replacing his efforts.”\n\nIt will, however, be impossible to replicate Washington’s body type at six-foot-seven and 264 pounds with the way he can move.\n\nPat Freeirmuth, Jonnu Smith, and Connor Heyward are the team’s listed other options at tight end on the 53-man roster.",

It’s been a long wait until Sunday to find out if the Philadelphia Eagles will have anything to play for in Week 18 when they host the Commanders for the season finale. The Eagles squeaked out a win in Buffalo when the Bills went for two, instead of attempting the extra point to take the game into overtime. Philly still has a shot to move up to the #2 seed in the NFC.\n\nThe Washington Commanders are currently sitting in the No. 7 overall spot in next year’s draft, and they can’t drop any lower than that. They can move up with help from other teams. QB Marcus Mariota had stitches in his throwing hand last week and didn’t play on Christmas day, and he was listed as day-to-day. Washington also has other players who are dealing with injuries that could be shut down for the season finale. Will the Eagles play their starters, or do they even need to for this sad finale to a lost season?\n\nJoin our partner FanDuel for all your betting needs\n\nOpening odds for the Commanders have them as 7.5-point home underdogs against the Eagles.

    "fullText": "OCEANSIDE -- Entering the second game of their back-to-back against the Sioux Falls Skyforce, TyTy Washington Jr. was converted from a standard G League contract with the San Diego Clippers to a Two-way spot with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nHe now occupies the spot previously held by RayJ Dennis, who was waived in the same transaction. Whether Dennis will return to San Diego on a standard G League contract is not known yet, but the Clippers do own his G League rights.\n\nWashington Jr. fills the third Two-way spot Los Angeles has, alongside Jordan Miller and Kobe Sanders. The latter two have yet to suit up for San Diego this season, as they've been on LAC duties due to injuries and roster inconsistency.\n\nThe 24 year-old guard in his stint for the Clippers averaged 19.9 points, 5.8 assists, 5.1 rebounds, and 1.7 steals over 36.1 minutes per game through 16 games. He really put his name on the map and essentially forced LA's hand to sign him after averaging 34 points, eight rebounds, five assists, and three steals per game during the NBA G League Winter Showcase.\n\nBack in the NBA!

He's been killing it down here in the G League. I think we've played 15, 16 games or something like that and he's been a monster in every single one of them,\" said Clippers forward Zach Freemantle.\n\nHe also noted that Washington Jr.'s hardwork being noticed and recognized is a good thing and that he deserves the call up.\n\nTyTy Washington Jr has been signed to the LA Clippers on a two-way contract. He replaced RayJ Dennis who was subsequently waived. San Diego will be shorthanded tonight against Miami's G League team -- Story later tonight\n\n— Jared Knobloch (@jknobloch8) December 29, 2025\n\nWith all the two-way players with Los Angeles, and no players on assignment (i.e. Yanic Konan Niderhouser), that left San Diego shorthanded against the Skyforce with only eight active players.\n\nBeing shorthanded, they ended up losing in a close game against Sioux Falls 101-98. The Clippers fall to 1-3 in the regular season, a stark difference from their 9-5 record during the Tip-off tournament.\n\nDespite the loss, Freemantle had a career-high 32 points, along with 10 rebounds. \"I was just trying to do whatever I could to help my team win,\" he said. \"There was some opportunity for me to score the ball tonight, and I just tried to take advantage of what the game gave me.\"\n\nFREEEEEEEEMANTLE pic.twitter.com/s9SovKnjPn\n\n— SD Clippers (@sandiego_clips) December 29, 2025\n\nThe Clippers will have some time off before having a rematch with the Raptors 905 on January 2.

Two others were killed in the strike, and the fourth was extradited to Colombia.\n\nThe U.S. military captured Chila, then sent him back to Ecuador to be prosecuted. However, the U.S. provided the Ecuadorian government with no evidence that could lead to Chila’s arrest. Any evidence proving that Chila was committing a crime on that boat, such as seized drugs, GPS records, or cell phones, was blasted to the bottom of the sea.\n\nThe Ecuadorian government was forced to let Chila go, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe failure to even apprehend an alleged narcoterrorist is at extreme odds with the 45-year-old Defense Secretary’s tough-on-narcoterrorism rhetoric.\n\n“If these people were drug traffickers and deserving of death, how is it that you would pick them up and just let them go?” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), a member of the House intelligence and foreign affairs committees, told the Post.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“We have consistently said that our intelligence did indeed confirm these boats were trafficking narcotics destined for America. That same intelligence also confirms that the individuals involved in these drug operations are/were narco-terrorists, and we stand by that assessment,” the Pentagon stated in a statement to The Post.\n\nHegseth has staked his reputation and potentially his job on the effectiveness of the boat strikes. Hegseth recently landed in hot water for an alleged “kill them all” order on a Venezuelan drug boat, killing survivors of an initial September 2 strike that critics have labeled a potential war crime.\n\nWhen reports of the order surfaced in late November, Hegseth boasted, “Biden coddled terrorists, we kill them.”\n\nThe “double tap” incident was Hegseth’s most serious controversy in a year full of embarrassments, leading to speculation he would soon face the axe.\n\nPresident Trump, 79, dumped responsibility for the attack on Hegseth, saying, “I didn’t know about the second strike. I didn’t know anything about people. I wasn’t involved.” However, he has also vocally supported Hegseth through the ordeal.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Several key issues remain unresolved in ongoing negotiations between Ukraine and the United States over a potential framework to end Russia’s war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week. Speaking about a 20-point plan under discussion, Zelenskyy outlined the most difficult points, noting that Ukraine has already conveyed its position to Washington, which is expected to communicate it to Moscow.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that the Kremlin had already been in contact with U.S. representatives since Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev recently met with U.S. envoys in Florida. However, he did not reveal any details, saying only: “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue.”\n\nZelenskyy said talks continue over the nature and scope of security guarantees that would be provided to Ukraine under any agreement. He said several technical issues remain, including how guarantees would be enforced and what monitoring mechanisms would be used to ensure compliance.\n\nZelenskyy said the fate of the territories that Russia claims remain the most difficult issue in the talks. He did not provide details, but has repeatedly said Kyiv will not recognize Russian control over occupied regions, including areas seized since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Zelenskyy has also repeatedly stated Ukraine will not cede territories it currently controls, which Russia has publicly demanded.\n\nZaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\n\nZelenskyy said the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains unresolved. The facility, Europe’s largest, has been under Russian control since early on in the war and has raised repeated international safety concerns due to fighting nearby.\n\nUkraine has been consistent in saying that safe operation of the station requires demilitarization of its territory, where Russia currently has troops stationed. Apart from that, Ukraine has been insisting that Ukrainian workers should be granted full access to the station, which they currently don’t have.\n\nDetails previously released in the course of the current negotiations revealed that the U.S. and Ukrainian teams are in discussion of a joint-access format, potentially between all three sides (the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia).\n\nZelenskyy said further discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. teams are expected, including talks in Florida, and that separate documents on economic recovery and prosperity are also under consideration.",

    "description": "Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell lambasted a performer’s decision to cancel an annual Christmas Eve jazz concert, following the addition of President Donald Trump’s name to the Washington, DC, arts venue.",
    "fullText": "Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell lambasted a performer’s decision to cancel an annual Christmas Eve jazz concert, following the addition of President Donald Trump’s name to the Washington, DC, arts venue.\n\nIn a letter, which the Kennedy Center shared a copy of with CNN, Grenell sharply criticizes jazz artist Chuck Redd’s actions and praises Trump for his leadership as the center’s chairman — a role the president’s handpicked board elected him to early in his second term after he ousted his predecessor.\n\n“Your decision to withdraw at the last moment—explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure—is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution,” Grenell, a longtime Trump confidant, wrote to Redd on letterhead bearing the new “Trump Kennedy Center” logo.\n\nThe Associated Press first reported on the letter.\n\nRedd told CNN on Wednesday that he canceled the holiday jazz concert, which he has hosted for nearly two decades, after seeing the board’s move to rename the building last week.\n\n“I’ve been performing at the Kennedy Center since the beginning of my career and I was saddened to see this name change,” Redd said.\n\nGrenell goes on to fault Redd for financial fallout relating to what he called a “political stunt” and said the center will seek $1 million in damages.\n\nCNN has reached out to Redd for comment on the letter.\n\nRoma Daravi, vice president of public relations at the Kennedy Center, echoed Grenell’s sentiment, arguing that Redd “failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people.”\n\n“Art is a shared cultural experience meant to unite, not exclude,” Daravi said in a statement to CNN. “The Trump Kennedy Center is a true bipartisan institution that welcomes artists and patrons from all backgrounds—great art transcends politics, and America’s cultural center remains committed to presenting popular programming that inspires and resonates with all audiences.”\n\nThe cancelation of the free “Jazz Jam” show followed a vote by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts’s board of trustees to rename the cultural institution for both the Democratic former president and Trump last week.\n\nIn the hours after the vote, the center updated its website and the following day installed new signage to the facade of the building bearing Trump’s name.\n\nThe move quickly sparked outrage from Kennedy family, lawmakers and patrons of the historic center, including a lawsuit from one Democratic congresswoman challenging whether the board has the authority to rename the facility, which Congress designated in 1964 as a memorial to the 35th president.\n\nPrior to the renaming, Trump’s overhaul of the center was already raising concerns about lost revenue as both artists and audiences flee for other venues. Artists including Issa Rae, Renée Fleming, Shonda Rhimes and Ben Folds resigned from their leadership roles or canceled events at the space. And Jeffrey Seller, producer of the hit musical “Hamilton,” canceled the show’s planned run earlier this year.\n\nThis holiday season, lagging ticket sales have also impacted “The Nutcracker,” historically one of the center’s most popular events. Approximately 10,000 seats were sold for this year’s production across seven performances, compared with around 15,000 seats each in the 2021 through 2024 performances, according to internal sales data reviewed by CNN.\n\nThe Kennedy Center comped approximately five times more tickets for the performances this year than in the past four years, the data showed. And this year’s show has fallen about half a million dollars short of its $1.5 million budgeted revenue goal.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN’s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Men who were part of the group of Venezuelan migrants that the United States government transferred earlier this year to a prison in El Salvador demanded justice on Friday, days after a federal judge in Washington ruled that the Trump administration must give them legal due process.\n\nThe men told reporters in Venezuela’s capital that they hope legal organizations can push their claims in court. Their press conference was organized by Venezuela’s government, which had previously said it had retained legal services for the immigrants.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge ordered the U.S. government to give legal due process to the 252 Venezuelan men, either by providing court hearings or returning them to the U.S. The ruling opens a path for the men to challenge the Trump administration’s allegation that they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang and subject to removal under an 18th century wartime law.\n\nThe men have repeatedly said they were physically and psychologically tortured while at the notorious Salvadoran prison.\n\n“Today, we are here to demand justice before the world for the human rights violations committed against each of us, and to ask for help from international organizations to assist us in our defense so that our human rights are respected and not violated again,” Andry Blanco told reporters in Caracas, where roughly two dozen of the migrants gathered Friday.\n\nSome of the men shared the daily struggles they now face — including fear of leaving their home or encountering law enforcement — as a consequence of what they said were brutal abuses while in prison. The men did not specify what justice should look like in their case, but not all are interested in returning to the U.S.\n\n“I don’t trust them,” Nolberto Aguilar said of the U.S. government.\n\nThe men were flown to El Salvador in March. They were sent to their home country in July as part of a prisoner swap between the Trump administration and the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nCamilla Fabri, Venezuelan vice minister of foreign affairs for international communications, said Maduro's government is working with a bar association in the U.S. and “all human rights organizations to prepare a major lawsuit against Trump and the United States government, so that they truly acknowledge all the crimes they have committed against” the men.",

    "description": "Steven Carroll and his son spent weekends flying JetBlue for a challenge that once sent them from New York to DC to Florida and back all in one day.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Steve Carroll, a New York-based nurse practitioner who chased JetBlue's \"25 for 25\" challenge to earn 350,000 points and Mosaic status for 25 years by flying to 25 unique cities by December 31. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBreakfast in Massachusetts, lunch in DC, dinner in Orlando, and back home by midnight. That was one of the epic days that my 10-year-old son and I flew for JetBlue Airways' \"25 for 25\" challenge.\n\nIt was thrilling to plan and execute these trips, with layovers so tight we sometimes barely had time for a bathroom break. Finding a flourishing community chasing this challenge was one of the best parts.\n\nThe promotion, created for JetBlue's 25th anniversary, is simple: Fly to 25 unique cities in the airline's network between June 25 and December 31, and you'll earn Mosaic 1 status for 25 years plus a lump sum of 350,000 points.\n\nThere are some rules: You must connect your loyalty number to each flight; basic fares don't qualify; flights must be operated by JetBlue (not its partners, such as Cape Air); and only arrival airports count.\n\nStill, I realized it could be an unforgettable experience for my son Jackson and I. He already loves JetBlue (I think the TV screens do it for him), and his 100th and 200th flights ever were on JetBlue.\n\nPlus, Mosaic status until age 35 means he and his friends could enjoy the perks — like free bags, complimentary drinks, dedicated security and check-in, early boarding, and seat upgrades — on future spring break or summer trips in college. (Editor's note: You must be a Mosaic  3 member or higher to receive complimentary Mint upgrades and a Mosaic 4 for lounge access when JetBlue's open in late 2025.)\n\nThe math also checked out. Completing the challenge earned each of us a reward of 350,000 points, at least $3,500 in travel apiece, plus the additional points earned from our flights.\n\nCombining the cash I paid plus the 100,000 JetBlue points I already had, the whole challenge cost around $7,000, but I was essentially reimbursed in points.\n\nI started the challenge already holding Mosaic, but securing long-term status now gives me more freedom to put everyday spending on other cards and build points with brands like Hyatt via Chase.\n\nJetBlue's new partnership with United Airlines also means I can tap into reciprocal benefits on United — an attractive perk since we live close to the airline's Newark, New Jersey, base.\n\nTo maximize our time, we mostly flew on weekends and sometimes took up to five flights across a Saturday or Sunday. We took closer to 35 flights overall because of the overlap at some departure and connecting airports.\n\nOur flights stretched west to Los Angeles, north to Portland, Maine, and south to Fort Lauderdale. We've also checked off airports like Cleveland, Norfolk, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Manchester in New Hampshire, Raleigh in North Carolina, and Buffalo in New York.\n\nOur most ambitious weekend was over Veterans Day in November, when we planned 18 flights and 11 new cities. The government shutdown, however, canceled five of them, but we managed to rebook and still add several new destinations.\n\nAside from those cancellations and a huge delay that forced us to postpone a trip, the challenge has been remarkably smooth. And we've met a great community of people also clamoring for 25 years of Mosaic status.\n\nWe recently flew in Mint business class to Los Angeles as our 23rd city and completed the challenge on December 8 in Fort Myers, with about three weeks to spare.\n\nI already had a few JetBlue trips on my calendar to start, but then I created a master list of airports in the Northeast along with their city pairs. I live just north of New York City.\n\nThe goal was to create snaking routes that efficiently hopscotch across the US; we're trying to avoid international flying. I'd sit up in bed when I couldn't sleep and just map out my options.\n\nOver time, I've figured out a few tricks: book one-ways, sit near the front, and choose the first and last flights of the day. Most fares averaged about $100 per person.\n\nI have lounge access that made longer layovers easier, though I occasionally booked \"illegal\" itineraries with very tight connections. Connecting airports, regardless of the time spent there, count as unique destinations.\n\nBut before I risked it, I checked the historical arrival times. One trip I planned included a 12-minute layover at New York-JFK, but we still made it because our flight from Hyannis, Massachusetts, landed half an hour early, as expected.\n\nWeather-tracking helped, too. I adjusted my flight if I anticipated a disruption, which my status allows me to do for free. An unofficial tool called \"25for25.ai\" was also helpful; you can plug in your starting point and block destinations you've already hit.\n\nLiving in the New York area made the challenge far more doable. Airports, like White Plains, LaGuardia, Newark, New York-JFK, and Islip on Long Island, are all considered separate, unique cities.\n\nNew York-JFK and Newark are especially useful since they offer so many connections. There's also Hartford, Connecticut, and Philadelphia nearby. That's seven of the 25 we just drove to.\n\nSmaller airports like Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts require more creativity because they offer limited frequencies.\n\nOne of our biggest travel days began in White Plains, New York, where we flew to Nantucket and had breakfast in town. We then headed to DC for lunch at the airport, and finally to Orlando for dinner, also at the airport.\n\nMy partner joined us on that trip, making it a family day in the skies. We crossed paths with about 15 other challengers on our legs to DC.\n\nWhat was extremely helpful was the dedicated Mosaic Facebook group, where other participants in the challenge shared routes and road warrior stories. It's not hosted by JetBlue.\n\nThe challenge fostered a vibrant and supportive community. (Editor's note: JetBlue told Business Insider that over 500 people have completed the promotion so far.)\n\nMy son and I sometimes saw other challengers on our flights and ate lunch together in the airport between legs. We helped a family of four explore the town during our layover in Nantucket.\n\nWe exchanged numbers with almost every person we met so we can stay in touch. I didn't expect to find such a large and enthusiastic community, but it was one of the best parts of the challenge.\n\nI have a little tag on my bag that somebody made for me that says 'JetBlue 25 for 25.' When people saw it, they were like, 'Oh, you're doing the challenge.'\n\nIt was nice getting help along the way, and I appreciate being able to help others, too, as we cheered them on to finish by the holidays.",

    "description": "\"Efficiency\" defined the 2025 job market from the federal government to Silicon Valley.",
    "fullText": "It's CEOs' favorite buzzword and white-collar workers' nightmare fuel.\n\n\"Efficency\" defined the 2025 job market from the federal government to Silicon Valley. For business and political leaders, it has become a catch-all term to signal they're leaning into AI, streamlining their workforce, and boosting productivity. A smaller bureaucracy is en vogue and increasing shareholder value was the year's hottest trend.\n\nBut reading the word in a company memo has had employees bracing for a pink slip.\n\nWith high interest rates, stubborn inflation, and steep tariff costs, businesses are looking for ways to balance their budgets — sparking a wave of layoffs across companies like Dell, AT&T, Verizon, and more.\n\nThe White House Department of Government Efficiency launched an overhaul of the government workforce, providing an especially stark example of the efficiency push to the private sector.\n\nChatbots, meanwhile, are becoming increasingly competent at coding, writing, and basic administrative tasks. It's culminating in tenuous job security and widespread hiring freezes, especially among college-educated office workers.\n\nOver the past twelve months, Business Insider has heard from job seekers, workers of all ages, business leaders, and HR professionals to understand how the \"efficiency\" motto is reshaping the jobs landscape and employee livelihoods. Some told us they're excited to learn new skills, while others feel it's impossible to keep up with rapidly changing expectations.\n\n\"I had this degree — and that's a privilege, not everyone has that opportunity — but it didn't matter, said Jaqueline Kline, a recent college graduate who applied to hundreds of jobs without landing a role. \"My GPA didn't matter. None of it mattered if I didn't have a job.\"\n\nIn 2025, Corporate America's efficiency rhetoric evolved from a company value to a religion.\n\nCEOs like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Andy Jassy, and Google's Sundar Pichai, among others, have been at the forefront of the \"Great Flattening,\" which involves simplifying organizational charts and removing layers of management. It's a bet that AI use and a smaller internal bureaucracy will translate to higher profits. The trend has led to a widespread reduction in early-career and middle-management jobs, partly to compensate for over-hiring at the height of the pandemic. It comes alongside a cooling economic landscape and a frustrated labor force.\n\n\"There are just so many people applying to the jobs, and there's only a limited number of jobs out there,\" said Charley Kim, a 20-something who landed a Big Tech role after a long search. He added, \"Getting an interview is probably harder than the interviews themselves.\"\n\nThe efficiency-driven workforce flattening isn't just happening in the tech sector: Airlines, finance firms, major retailers, and media companies laid off thousands of workers this year, many of them in office-based roles.\n\nIt's beginning to appear in the data as well. Long-term unemployment rates are rising as quit rates decline — meaning companies are hiring less, while workers who do have jobs are hesitant to make a move. Unemployment and layoff rates are still relatively low, though the US is only seeing substantial job growth in the healthcare and construction fields. Employee confidence metrics indicate that workers are feeling less secure in their roles. That is, if they can land a job at all.\n\n\"My dream job might exist,\" Isabella Clemmens said around her college graduation in May. \"But I'm one of 400 people applying for it.\"\n\nShortly after President Donald Trump took office in January, the Elon Musk-led DOGE office began cutting thousands of federal workers across various agencies, citing a need for reduced spending and less bureaucracy.\n\nJob reports show that 265,000 government employees have left their roles this year. The staff cuts have continued throughout the year — even as Musk left his post, DOGE disbanded, and courts blocked some of the firings.\n\nDOGE's cuts were part of a broader invocation of efficiency from Musk. He sent federal workers his infamous \"5 things\" email, which asked government employees to regularly document their job duties and productivity. Any \"failure to respond will be taken as a resignation,\" he said. The email followed Trump's instruction to \"get more aggressive\" in reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy.\n\nIt may be too early to tell if the efficiency crusades of the private and public sectors are paying off. Corporate America seems to still have a gloomy economic outlook; \"tariffs,\" \"uncertainty\" and \"inflation\" are among the top words used by executives in company earning calls — coupled with frequent mentions of an AI bubble.\n\nA McKinsey report published in June shows that nearly eight in 10 companies are using generative AI, and the majority report \"no significant bottom-line impact.\" It's possible that this efficiency bet could save some companies in the long run, though lower interest rates will probably make a more tangible difference. Even Musk himself said DOGE was \"a little bit\" successful, but he wouldn't do it again.\n\nFor workers, the job-search process has never felt less efficient. They still need to pay the bills.\n\n\"What I look for in a job has gotten so much broader in this process,\" Abbey Owens said as she was searching for a job last summer. \"It was very specific originally, and it's just really grown into: 'I'll accept almost anything.'\"",

    "title": "By The Numbers: Cowboys win 30-23, but 87, 38 and 6 tell the story",
    "description": "Week 17 will go down as a win for the Cowboys but there are other numbers that tell the real story of what happened against Washington.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys’ Week 17 win over the rival Washington Commanders won’t be remembered for much. Both teams entered the Christmas Day affair firmly eliminated from playoff contention and both teams showed exactly why they are categorized as pretenders rather than contenders.\n\nDespite claiming the 30-23 win, the day rang hollow for Dallas. Not since Clark W. Griswald was enrolled in the Jelly of the Month club has such a disappointing gift been bestowed. The Cowboys moved to 7-8-1 with a chance to avoid a losing season next week, but the game was against a third-string quarterback and took until the final minute to seal the deal. The win was big for the culture but wasn't, by any means, uplifting.\n\nUnlike most weeks, it wasn’t about the final score or the win-loss record. Those numbers pale in comparison to a few other telling numbers. At the end of the day it’s all about 87, 38, and 6. An explanation:\n\n87 offensive plays is a ridiculously high number of plays for an offense to post in an overtime game, let alone a game played entirely in regulation. Compared to the Commanders' 41 plays, it signaled total dominance on the afternoon. Combined with the 152-yard delta in offensive yards gained, it showed Dak Prescott and company were clearly in control. Considering there were zero Cowboys’ turnovers, it’s hard to believe Dallas only won by seven points.\n\nIf this proves anything it’s that it takes more than a dominant offense to safely win in today’s NFL. The Cowboys’ break-but-don’t bend defense (you read that correctly) has given up points in droves this season and far too often rewarded touchdowns on red zone appearances. No yards were wasted for Washington.\n\nThe Cowboys' 87 plays are the third-most in an NFL game this season, per TruMedia.\n\n— Nicki Jhabvala (@NickiJhabvala) December 25, 2025\n\nTime of possession is one of the more overrated stats in the NFL, yet it does shed light on the current state of affairs in Dallas. In this case it speaks to the Cowboys' balance and efficiency on offense. It also exposes their second-half struggles where they only managed six total points which comes on the heels of a Week 16 game where Dallas scored zero points in the second half against the Chargers.\n\nIt's a one-score game with 16 seconds left in the third quarter. Cowboys, 27-20. Cowboys have not scored a second-half touchdown since the fourth quarter of the Detroit game. It's up to 14 possessions without a second half TD (2 vs. Lions, 5 vs Minn, 5 vs. Chargers, 2 vs. Wash)\n\n— Todd Archer (@toddarcher) December 25, 2025\n\nThe Cowboys' offense has proved their worth in efficiency but haven’t been opportunistic enough to turn all those yards into points. With so many plays and so much ball control, one would expect the Cowboys to strike gold more often than they did. Much like Buzz McCallister’s life savings, it was there for the taking, the Cowboys just couldn’t scale the bookshelf well enough to secure the lunchbox.\n\nDak Prescott was under constant assault in Week 17, falling six times for 38 yards to sacks. A case could be made three of the six sacks are on Prescott himself, but the situation highlights the pass protection limits this offense has had in 2025.\n\nThe need to fix the pass protection on the offensive line is real and has to be a priority this coming offseason.\n\nYou can follow Reid on X @ReidDHanson and be sure to follow Cowboys Wire on Facebook to join in on the conversation with fellow fans!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: By The Numbers: Cowboys win 30-23, but 87, 38 and 6 tell the story",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Washington Commanders will kick off Week 17 in the NFL with a Christmas Day matchup versus the Dallas Cowboys at Nortwest Field.\n\nWashington's season is already over, as Dan Quinn's squad sits at 4-11 heading into Thursday's game against Dallas and has been eliminated from playoff contention for the last few weeks.\n\nAdditionally, the Commanders are deep into their quarterback depth. With Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota out with injuries, Washington is turning to Josh Johnson to command the offense. Let's get to know Johnson a bit more ahead of the Commanders' Week 17 contest.\n\nJohnson played college football at San Diego from 2004 to 2007, and entered the league in 2008 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nSince entering the NFL, Johnson has broken the record for most teams played with, at 14. The 39-year-old has had stints with the Buccaneers, San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns, Cincinnati Bengals, New York Jets, Indianapolis Colts, Buffalo Bills, Baltimore Ravens, New York Giants, Houston Texans, Oakland Raiders, Washington Commanders, Detroit Lions, and Denver Broncos. He has also spent time in the UFL and XFL.\n\nJohnson has started nine games in his career, posting a 1-8 record. His lone win came with Washington in 2018.\n\nThursday's matchup with Dallas will be Johnson's tenth career start. We'll see if the journeyman veteran can lead the Commanders to a Christmas victory and help the franchise gain some momentum heading into 2026.\n\nIs Amon-Ra St. Brown playing today?

    "description": "Here are players to start and sit in fantasy football from the Washington Commanders and Dallas Cowboys Week 17 matchup.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders will face the Dallas Cowboys at Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland, in one of three Christmas Day NFL games.\n\nThe Commanders will be without backup quarterback Marcus Mariota, leaving Josh Johnson to start with Jeff Driskel as the backup. Without Mariota, the Commanders' offense becomes one-dimensional and easy to defend.\n\nThis is a game for bragging rights at this point, as both teams have been eliminated from the playoffs. It's a divisional matchup, though, and both teams want the win. Anything can happen in a divisional game, and this one is no exception, which is why there are still players with value in fantasy football leagues.\n\nIf you've made it this far into the fantasy football season, congratulations. If you roster any of the players on either of these teams, here are some players to start and sit in Week 17.\n\nThe Commanders allow the 2nd-most fantasy points to quarterbacks in the entire league. Prescott is a solid quarterback with decent receivers, and he'll be facing a Commanders secondary that is missing some key pieces. Prescott is likely to feast against the Commanders on Christmas Day, making him a must-start in this game.\n\nTreylon Burks has seen an increased number of targets in recent weeks, but he's not reliable enough to have fantasy value against the Cowboys this week. If Marcus Mariota plays, he will target Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel. If Josh Johnson starts, he could target Burks, but they didn't have a lot of success last week. Don't expect much out of Burks in Week 17.\n\nWilliams is currently questionable with a neck injury, and with the playoffs out of reach for the Cowboys, he might not suit up, so keep an eye on that. He did practice in a limited capacity on Tuesday, and if he suits up on Thursday, he will face a Commanders defense that ranks 28th in the league and allows the 4th-most fantasy points to running backs. He is a must-start if he is healthy enough to play.\n\nDespite the Commanders' current reliance on the ground game, McNichols isn't a viable option at running back this week. Chris Rodriguez Jr. and Jacory Croskey-Merritt are the top two running backs for the Commanders, and while McNichols has dual ground and air abilities, he isn't getting the same touches as the other two backs, and he rarely finds the end zone.\n\nThe Cowboys actually allow more points to wide receivers than running backs, but they still allow the 6th-most points to running backs in the NFL. The only way the Commanders' wide receivers have any fantasy value is if Marcus Mariota plays. If he doesn't, the Commanders will rely heavily on the ground game. This means that Wild Bill and Chris Rodriguez Jr. will get plenty of touches. Croskey-Merritt has scored in each of the last two games and could have a big game if the Commanders are forced to keep the ball on the ground.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Week 17 fantasy start/sit vs. Dallas Cowboys",

    "fullText": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) brought up the rear in a new poll asking Americans to assess the job performance of 13 U.S. leaders.\n\nGallup’s latest survey, conducted Dec. 1-15, found that 28% of Americans approve of how Schumer is handling his duties.\n\nHe was the only figure below 30%, a mark weighed down by an abysmal 39% approval rating among Democratic respondents. That represented a dramatic 37-point drop from January 2024, when 76% of Democrats approved of Schumer’s job performance, according to Gallup’s data.\n\nThe latest Gallup poll reflects fallout from a tumultuous year for Schumer.\n\nThe Minority Leader was roundly mocked by Republicans and upbraided by his own party after eight members of the Senate Democratic Caucus broke ranks to end the 43-day shutdown without securing an extension of enhanced health care subsidies.\n\nSchumer’s tactical misfire, coupled with his refusal to endorse New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, led some frustrated Democrats to call for new leadership.\n\n“Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) posted on X. “If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?”\n\nBeyond Schumer, Gallup found that none of the 12 U.S. leaders from Congress, the Cabinet, the Supreme Court or the Federal Reserve earned majority-level approval.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell received the top mark with a 44% approval rating. He was followed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio (41%), Vice President JD Vance (39%) and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F.

    "fullText": "Dec. 24 (UPI) -- The Washington Commanders will start quarterback Josh Johnson on Thursday against the Dallas Cowboys, coach Dan Quinn announced Wednesday.\n\nJohnson moved into the role due to injuries to starter Jayden Daniels and second-string option Marcus Mariota, who will not play in Week 17.\n\nQuinn said Jeff Driskel will serve as the Commanders' backup quarterback against the Cowboys. He also announced that the Commanders will promote Sam Hartman from their practice squad. Hartman will work as the Commanders' emergency third-string quarterback Thursday in Landover, Md.\n\nDaniels, who was ruled out for the remainder of the season due to an elbow injury on Dec. 15, last played Dec. 7. The 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year completed 60.6% of his throws for 1,262 yards, eight scores and three interceptions over seven appearances during his second season. He also ran for two scores.\n\nMariota completed 61.2% of his throws for 1,695 yards, 10 scores and seven interceptions over 11 appearances this season. He completed 7 of 14 passes for 95 yards Saturday against the Philadelphia Eagles before exiting due to hand and quad injuries.\n\nJohnson completed 5 of 9 passes for 43 yards and an interception in relief of Mariota. The NFL journeyman completed 58% of his throws for 2,340 yards, 13 scores and 17 interceptions over 48 career appearances.\n\nQuinn said he is hopeful that Mariota can recover and return for the Commanders in Week 18.\n\nThe Commanders (4-11) will host the Cowboys (6-8-1) at 1 p.m. EST Thursday at Northwest Stadium. They will again meet the Eagles for their season finale Jan. 4 in Philadelphia.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a March presidential memorandum to revoke the security clearance of prominent Washington attorney Mark Zaid, ruling that the order — which also targeted 14 other individuals — could not be applied to him.\n\nThe decision marked the administration’s second legal setback on Tuesday, after the Supreme Court declined to allow Trump to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area, capping a first year in office in which President Donald Trump’s efforts to impose a sweeping agenda and pursue retribution against political adversaries have been repeatedly slowed by the courts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington granted Zaid's request for a preliminary injunction, after he sued the Trump administration in May over the revocation of his security clearance. Zaid's request called it an act of “improper political retribution” that jeopardized his ability to continue representing clients in sensitive national security cases.\n\nThe March presidential memorandum singled out Zaid and 14 other individuals who the White House asserted were unsuitable to retain their clearances because it was “no longer in the national interest.” The list included targets of Trump’s fury from both the political and legal spheres, including former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, New York Attorney General Letitia James, former President Joe Biden and members of his family.\n\nThe action was part of a much broader retribution campaign that Trump has waged since returning to the White House, including directing specific Justice Department investigations against perceived adversaries and issuing sweeping executive orders targeting law firms over legal work he does not like.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration said it was revoking the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials. Ordering the revocation of clearances has been a favored retributive tactic that Trump has wielded — or at least tried to — against high-profile political figures, lawyers and intelligence officials in his second term.\n\nZaid said in his lawsuit that he has represented clients across the political spectrum over nearly 35 years, including government officials, law enforcement and military officials and whistleblowers. In 2019, he represented an intelligence community whistleblower whose account of a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped set the stage for the first of two impeachment cases against Trump in his first term.\n\n\"This court joins the several others in this district that have enjoined the government from using the summary revocation of security clearances to penalize lawyers for representing people adverse to it,\" Ali wrote in his order.\n\nAli emphasized that his order does not prevent the government from revoking or suspending Zaid’s clearance for reasons independent of the presidential memorandum and through normal agency processes. The preliminary injunction does not go into effect until January 13.\n\nZaid said in a statement, “This is not just a victory for me, it’s an indictment of the Trump administration’s attempts to intimidate and silence the legal community, especially lawyers who represent people who dare to question or hold this government accountable.\"",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "description": "Parker Washington, Quentin Johnston highlight the top waiver wire wide receiver targets entering Week 17.",
    "fullText": "Hello! Happy holidays and welcome to the Week 17 waiver wire watch for wide receivers!\n\nThis is the end of the line. Championship week is here for most fantasy leagues and whether you’re gunning for the title or trying to avoid the humiliation of finishing last, your fantasy season comes down to one final matchup. So its time to start looking for ways to fortify your rosters for the grand finale.\n\nWe’ll go over some performers that you should consider scooping off the waiver wire ahead of Week 17 and as always, we’ll classify a waiver add as someone who is rostered in 60% of leagues at the max. There are three games set for Christmas on Thursday and two games set for Saturday, so make sure to get your lineups situated early this week.\n\nTrevor Lawrence has been in sync with his receiver core for the past month and Washington ended up being his favorite target in the Jaguars’ 34-20 statement victory over the Broncos on Sunday. The third-year wideout was a fireworks factory at Mile High Stadium, posting a career-day by catching six of 10 targets for 145 receiving yards and a first-quarter touchdown that opened the scoring festivities for Jacksonville.\n\nHe exited Sunday as a top-three fantasy wideout in all scoring formats for the week and that’s a testament to the role that he’s played in the Jags offense in recent weeks. Momentum is on their side right now and if you need a skill guy to get you over the hump in the final week, then a Jags receiver like Washington would be a solid choice.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Indianapolis Colts, 1 p.m. ET\n\nJohnston had his most productive game of the season on Sunday as the Chargers moved a step closer to clinching a playoff spot in their 34-17 victory over the Cowboys. The third-year wideout from TCU was hitting home runs with each catch, turning four receptions into 104 receiving yards including a first-quarter touchdown reception that put them on the board.\n\nJohnston has been relatively quiet in the second half of the season after storming out the gate with a strong start in the first month of the campaign. His big-play abilities will come in handy for the Chargers in the coming weeks and he could be a helpful hand in your championship game.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: vs. Houston Texans, 4:30 p.m. ET (Saturday afternoon)\n\nThe Broncos missed a chance to clinch the AFC West title in a 34-20 loss on Sunday and will have to wait until Christmas night at Arrowhead Stadium to get another crack at it. Franklin will most likely play a role in that matchup like he played a role in Sunday’s game, catching four of six targets for 66 receiving yards in the loss at home.\n\nFranklin has been a solid Flex pick up in deeper leagues for a while now as he’s been a top-25 fantasy wideout in four of his last six outings. He continue to flex his rapport with his college teammate Bo Nix and he may get a chance to bury a Chiefs team that has nothing to play for.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Kansas City Chiefs, 8:15 p.m. ET (Thursday night)\n\nThe Lions’ playoff hopes are on life support as their 29-24 loss to the Steelers on Sunday eliminated them from NFC North title contention and left them with the faintest of hope to grab the final Wild Card spot in the NFC. Seven different players caught at least three passes for the Lions in this one and Raymond made his mark with four catches for 62 receiving yards and a touchdown.\n\nWith their backs against the wall, Dan Campbell may throw everything and the kitchen sink at the Vikings on Christmas. Expect to see a bunch of different pass-catchers get utilized on Thursday and we may see another strong effort out of Raymond.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Minnesota Vikings, 4:30 p.m. ET (Thursday afternoon)",

    "title": "Famous Idaho Potato Bowl: Utah State puts up dud against Washington State in its third consecutive bowl loss",
    "description": "Utah State hasn’t had much luck in recent bowl games, but optimism surrounds the school’s athletic department regardless",
    "fullText": "It was an ugly look for Utah State in its Famous Idaho Potato Bowl performance on Monday.\n\nThe issues were nothing new with the lack of QB protection, struggles on third downs and a missed field goal. Still, the result is the same, and the Aggies walked away with a 34-21 loss against future Pac-12 foe Washington State.\n\nMonday’s loss was the third straight bowl game loss for the Aggies.\n\n“We just ultimately didn’t play consistently enough, really in any phase, to end up having a chance to take over and win the game,” said Aggies head coach Bronco Mendenhall. “When there are moments we start to battle back, our execution didn’t hold, or our consistency didn’t hold, and that’s exactly where we were. So, I’m looking forward to the continued growth of this program, really looking forward to the Pac-12.”\n\nThe offense looked bad at times and inept in others. For the first time this season, Utah State was completely shut out in the first half.\n\nAs they had for much of the season, the problems started with the offensive line. Washington State’s defense had three sacks, six TFLs and four QB hurries in the win.\n\nUtah State had a total of just 49 yards in the first half.\n\n“(Washington State’s defense) was outstanding and there’s a reason they’ve been statistically strong not only this year at Washington State but the defensive coordinator, the previous two years, and his FCS staff were leading the country in defense,” Mendenhall said. “So, really strong scheme, really good players that execute well within that. Again, they were consistent. They were consistently better, really, in most circumstances until the very end, where we were able to make a last-minute push.”\n\nWashington State also dominated time of possession, 35:48 to Utah State’s 24:12. The Aggies also converted on only three of 13 total third downs.\n\nBryson Barnes had very little protection all day and finished his final college game with 116 passing yards, no touchdowns and one interception.\n\nBarnes ran it into the end zone for Utah State’s first touchdown in the third quarter. It was his 10th rushing touchdown of the year, which extends his school record.\n\nDespite giving up 34 points and 628 yards, the Utah State defense played decently well. It held Washington State to 14 points in the first half. It also had two sacks, nine TFLs and three interceptions.\n\nThe issue arose when the offense couldn’t stay on the field, forcing the defense back onto the field. It played well in red zone situations, but the defense was just asked to do too much.\n\nWashington State largely got it done in the air. Quarterback Zevi Eckhaus led with 334 passing yards and three touchdown passes. The Cougars finished with a total of 373 passing yards.\n\n“You have to give Washington State credit because they were executing,” Mendenhall said. “There was really no intent nor capability to run the ball in the first half. Washington State was mostly in the air, and they had success being able to run the football in the second half, which then kept our defense off balance in playing run calls, pass calls, and neither very consistently, which led to some big plays.”\n\nThe game went from bad to worse for Utah State as Ike Larsen was ejected from the game in the third quarter following a targeting call. He finished with an interception for the Aggies in his final game.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Barnes went down after taking a rough hit and exited the game.\n\nBackup quarterback Jacob Conover did give the Aggies a slight boost and something positive to look at on the stat sheet. He finished with 78 yards and two touchdown passes.\n\n“We preach just always being ready,” Conover said. “I think that just goes to show the culture that Coach Mendenhall has established. Week 13, guys are going down and it just shows the relentlessness of our team.”\n\nMonday’s bowl game felt emblematic of all the issues Utah State had. It showed that it often had the talent to play with good teams, but a few Achilles heels kept it below its potential.\n\nThe Utah State program has been full of optimism about the future over the past few weeks. Despite ending the season with two losses in its final three games, the guys were excited to get one last game.\n\nThat, combined with the excitement of a new conference and the stability of a seasoned FBS coach, created a hopeful atmosphere around the program. The poor bowl game performance definitely left a bad taste in the mouth, but it hasn’t dampened any excitement for the future of football in Logan.\n\n“I’m thrilled with the direction of Utah State football, but also Utah State athletics,” Mendenhall said. “Our athletic director is here, and I think there’s just fantastic leadership and alignment that exists there. Our new president is, man, the trifecta seems to be lined up really well. I certainly have to do my part, but I love the leadership, I love the direction, I love the support and now I love the opportunity with a new league and this program.”",

On the other hand, the USU defense will hopefully have a strong game, despite being inconsistent all season, because Wazzu’s offense has averaged 21.6 points this season.\n\nJoin the discussion before, during, and after the games by sharing your thoughts on these questions and",

    "fullText": "Is there any way this season can simply end?\n\nNo, there is not. The Washington Commanders will need to find a way to get through the final two games and see if they can get some players back healthy.\n\nQuarterback Marcus Mariota is battling with an injured quad and hand. Head coach Dan Quinn told the media on Sunday that they may even need to sign a quarterback to help them finish the season.\n\n\"It was [a] cleat that got to his hand on the top,\" Quinn said. \"But I don't know yet. It's swollen. I'd say we're going to, you know, call it day-to-day right now, of where it's at both with the hand and with the quad. And so, let's see what tomorrow is, and the following day. Then I'd say by two days from now, we'll have a very good estimate of where he is.\"\n\nThough Quinn didn't rule out needing to sign another quarterback, he did go ahead and rule out playing Jayden Daniels, the team's starting quarterback, in either of the final two games (Dallas, at Philadelphia). \"We would not consider playing Jayden. So, the first two options are the ones you were leading into of [QB] Josh [Johnson] and [QB] Sam [Hartman]. Would we consider somebody else coming in if he's not able to? Yeah, all those are on the table. That's something that [General Manager] Adam [Peters] and I are discussing tonight, and we did today. But yeah, option A and B, as you had said, but not C.\"\n\nJohnson is simply way beyond his best years, and Hartman? Did you see him in the preseason games? Yet, the Commanders chose to keep Hartman instead of looking elsewhere all season.\n\nQuinn certainly doesn't want to go out and sign a quarterback, bring him to Ashburn, and have him learn to play, if needed, in these final two weeks. You talk about difficult. It's difficult enough to find anyone who can play any position, but you actually think you might consider it for the final two weeks of an NFL regular season? Remember, this is a short week for Washington, which plays the Dallas Cowboys on Christmas Day [Thursday].\n\n\"I think it'd be difficult at any spot, but I think we're looking, let's see where Marcus is, where are we looking for the next two games too. So, that was really kind of our thought behind the discussions of where we are. I would say difficult, not impossible, but definitely difficult. I think we just saw somebody do it last week or two weeks ago pretty quickly. Not on our team [laughs], but I did see it happening. I was pretty impressed by it.\"\n\nYes, this is an NFL season many a Commanders fan might simply wish they could wake up and find this season had all been a bad dream... a really bad dream.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Who will start at quarterback on Christmas Day?",

He stayed down on one knee after a play and was clearly shaken-up.\n\nIf Mariota can't return, veteran quarterback Josh Johnson will take the reins of the offense. Jayden Daniels is not available after being shut down for the season. The Commanders do not have a third quarterback available after Mariota and Johnson.\n\nFollow our tracker below for the latest updates on Mariota's status for the rest of the game against Philly.\n\nUPDATE: The Commanders are back on offense and Johnson is still in the game, so it looks like Mariota isn't returning. The team has not confirmed that, though.\n\nUPDATE: Mariota is now out of the locker room and back on the sideline, but he still has his right hand wrapped and hasn't grabbed his helmet. Not a good sign for his chances of returning.\n\nUPDATE: Mariota was evaluated for a concussion, but was cleared. However, the Commanders also revealed he is dealing with a right hand injury and is now questionable to return.\n\nUPDATE: Mariota is now heading to the locker room, according to Nicki Jhabvala of The Athletic. That is a bad sign for his chances of returning to the game.\n\nESPN's John Keim adds that Mariota had his throwing hand wrapped in a towel, so that appears to be his injury.\n\nStill no update from the team, though.\n\nMariota is headed to the medical tent to get checked out.

    "fullText": "Washington State improved to 5-8 with its second consecutive win, defeating the Mercer Bears 84-78. Mercer, out of the Southern Conference, traveled to Pullman at 7–4 looking to snap a two-game skid.\n\nKenPom projected a 79-75 win for the Cougars, and the betting line sat at WSU -7.5.\n\nThe game got off to a shaky start as the Cougs surrendered a wide-open three to Mercer, and ND Oakafor picked up an early technical foul.\n\nThe teams traded buckets early, with the Cougs coming out hot and scoring 13 points in the first four minutes. However, the offense soon went stagnant, as turnover issues plagued Washington State once again. The Cougs managed just two points over the next six minutes.\n\nDefensive struggles resurfaced for WSU, allowing Mercer to score 25 points in the first ten minutes. Ace Glass helped keep the Cougars afloat, starting 5-of-8 from the floor.\n\nDefensive intensity picked up for Washington State, but the Bears reached the bonus with five minutes remaining in the half due to several chintzy off-ball fouls.\n\nThere was very little separation between the teams in the first half. Glass scored 14 points before the break, and the Cougs shot an impressive 59% from the field. Despite that efficiency, WSU led by just two, 41–39. Eight turnovers allowed Mercer to attempt eight more shots than Washington State.\n\nThe Cougs opened the second half strong, highlighted by a deep three from Glass that pushed the lead to five. Mercer responded immediately and tied the game.\n\nAdria Rodriguez delivered a strong defensive performance, recording a steal and a score and making his presence felt throughout the game. Adria seems to be playing far more confident than earlier in the season, coming up with 7 points as-well.\n\nThen the Cougars finally erupted. WSU hit eight straight field goals, including three triples from Ri Vavers, stretching the lead to 14.\n\nWashington State had opportunities to put the game away but failed to capitalize, missing multiple easy looks off turnovers. ND Oakafor also missed two free throws after a missed dunk. The lead never grew beyond fourteen.\n\nCoach David Riley later went to a lineup in which Thrastarson was the primary scoring threat, and the offense went ice cold.\n\nThe Cougs slowed down near the finish line as Mercer’s Baraka Okojie continued to knock down mid-range jumpers. The Bears extended the game with fouling and quick shots but never cut the deficit to fewer than five points.\n\nGlass finished with 24 points on 8-of-14 shooting. It was a balanced offensive effort for the Cougars, with four other players scoring in double figures. Eemeli Yalaho posted a strong performance with 14 points and eight rebounds, while Rihards Vavers came off the bench to hit four three-pointers. WSU shot 54% from the floor, and sunk 11 of their 23 three-point attempts.\n\nThis had the makings of a comfortable win for the Cougars, who entered the game ranked 154th in KenPom among a group of teams with winning records. However, the finish left much to be desired, as WSU effectively put on the brakes. The Cougs could have won by 20 or more, but instead escaped with a six-point victory.\n\nWashington State has played much better since returning from the Maui Invitational, holding opponents under 80 points in six straight games after allowing 80-plus in five of their first six contests. At 5-8, the Cougs have dropped four swing-games to Idaho, Arizona State, Bradley, and USC.\n\nUSC currently ranks 39th in KenPom, Arizona State sits at 64th, and Bradley at 119th, showing that Washington State has competed well against solid opponents recently.\n\nHopefully, David Riley can build on this two-game winning streak as conference play approaches. The Cougs will make a brief Pacific Northwest swing, facing the Portland Pilots in Portland on December 28 before traveling to Seattle to take on the Redhawks on December 30. Seattle U recently upset Washington and sits at 10-2, setting up a fun matchup for Coug fans at Climate Pledge Arena.\n\nWashington State’s next contest, at the University of Portland, will air on ESPN+ at 2:00 p.m. on December 28.",

I said it and it’s on the record,” said Smith. “Never would I compromise my love for God, the faith I have in this city.

He has since credited increased film study and early arrivals at the facility for his Week 15 dominance -- something he aims to sustain.\n\nBullen confirmed Carter's renewed commitment.\n\n\"He's been foot on the gas,\" Bullen said. \"He's even brought a couple teammates with him this week, too.\"\n\nThe coordinator highlighted the rookie's growth, noting that \"the production on the field was validation for the improvements and commitment he made to the process.\"\n\nAddressing rookie hurdles, Bullen preached experience above all -- something Carter gains each week.\n\n\"There's an element of it that the players have to experience it and feel that for themselves,\" he said. \"You don't know what you don't know.\"\n\nBullen credited Carter for responding positively to learning moments and leaning deeper into the process.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Charlie Bullen lauds Abdul Carter's breakthrough after benchings",

    "description": "I rode in business class on the Amtrak NextGen Acela train from NYC to Washington, DC, for $180. It was a great experience, but not worth the price.",
    "fullText": "The Amtrak Acela is an express service between Boston and Washington, DC. The train line introduced a new fleet on the route in August 2025, known as NextGen Acela.\n\nIn addition to being the fastest Amtrak train with a top speed of 160 miles per hour, the NextGen Acela has modern interiors and high-tech amenities.\n\nThe Amtrak Acela trains only have two classes — business and first. I booked my business-class ticket for $180.\n\nOut of curiosity, I looked at the pricing for coach seating on the regional Amtrak train, which is 30 minutes slower than the Acela. It was $40.\n\nMy train was scheduled to leave at 10 a.m., but there was a 90-minute delay. Since I was stuck at the station for longer than anticipated, I briefly considered going to the Metropolitan Lounge, an elevated space overlooking the train hall with cozy seating and complimentary refreshments.\n\nFirst-class passengers and those traveling in sleeper accommodations can get into the lounge for free, but other Amtrak riders have to pay $50 to access it.\n\nSince I'd already splurged on the business-class ticket, I decided to skip the lounge and head to the standard waiting room instead, but it was full. I finally settled for a seat on the floor against the wall until it was time to board.\n\nWhen I got in line to board, I was reminded that business class is just a standard ticket on the Amtrak Acela. Unlike business-class rides I've taken that also had coach seating, this trip didn't include the perk of priority boarding.\n\nSoft, cushy, spacious, supportive — these are the words that popped into my head when I settled into my business-class seat. A reclining function and footrest made the ride even more comfortable.\n\nPower outlets, USB ports, and a reading light were all conveniently located on the side of the seat. In front of me was a tray table and a fold-out cupholder.\n\nMost Amtrak trains I've been on have had WiFi, but in my experience, the connection has typically been too weak for much more than a Google search.\n\nI was stoked when the NextGen Acela's 5G WiFi was fast enough to stream YouTube videos without any issues. I passed the time by watching live sessions of my favorite bands.\n\nI've learned to set the bar low for train bathrooms. Stocked toilet paper, soap, and paper towels are not a given. Cleanliness and extra space aren't either. In my experience, some business-class bathrooms are no different from those in coach.\n\nSo I was ecstatic when I stepped inside the lavatory on the NextGen Acela. The automatic door opened into a spotless space that felt big enough for two people to do jumping jacks simultaneously.\n\nI found it aesthetically pleasing too, with bold red accents and trendy touches, from the shelf to the mirror.\n\nI also appreciated the touchless water, soap, and dryer functions on the sink.\n\n\"Amtrak travelers always have their preference,\" an Amtrak representative wrote in an email to Business Insider. \"If they want to experience these premium trains with enhanced amenities, they can. Or, if they prefer convenient and affordable downtown-to-downtown service up and down the Northeast Corridor, Northeast Regional trains offer a comfortable and enjoyable way to travel throughout the Northeast Corridor and points beyond.\"\n\nThe next time I take an Amtrak train, I'll miss the cozy seat, elevated bathroom, high-speed WiFi, and shorter travel time. Still, these perks weren't enough for me to consider Acela's business class to be worth more than quadruple the price of a coach ticket.",

He ran for 523 yards this season.\n\nMohammed spent the last two seasons in Seattle and took on a larger role in 2025. He took 106 carries for 523 yards and five touchdowns as a sophomore and had 17 receptions for 138 yards in the passing game.\n\nAs a freshman in 2024, Adam Mohammed ran for 193 yards while adding 41 receiving yards. A product of Glendale (Ariz.) Apollo, he will have two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.\n\nThe On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\nWashington put together a strong second season under Jedd Fisch in 2025, completing a 9-4 campaign with a victory over Boise State in the LA Bowl last week. Quarterback Demond Williams shined in his first year as the full-time starter, completing 69.5% of his passes for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns, to eight interceptions. He also added 611 rush yards and six touchdowns on the ground.\n\nAfterward, Fisch discussed the importance of keeping core players in tact as he gets ready for Year 3. He said the goal is to maintain as much continuity as possible on the roster, and he specifically pointed to Williams’ importance given the way he played throughout the year.\n\n“I thought, if you look at Raiden Vines probably had his first touchdown, he’s a freshman,” Fisch said in his LA Bowl press conference. “Dezmen Roebuck back had his seventh touchdown of the season. He’s a freshman. Demond played elite. He’s a sophomore. We play with probably the most freshmen in all of college football. Plays that were being made by guys were all young players. Players for the most part that all have eligibility left.\n\n“Our goal obviously is to bring back as many players as we possibly can. I think our guys know that we’ve got a great season coming ahead of us. We’ve got a great team. They’re led by an elite player. When you have an elite quarterback, you’ve got a great opportunity to win a lot of games.”",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "fullText": "Growth in the US economy – and the president’s political survival – rest on AI. The EU must use its leverage and stand up to him\n\nThe unthinkable has happened. The US is Europe’s adversary. The stark, profound betrayal contained in the Trump administration’s national security strategy should stop any further denial and dithering in Europe’s capitals. Cultivating “resistance Europe’s current trajectory in European nations” is now Washington’s stated policy.\n\nBut contained within this calamity is the gift of clarity. Europe will fight or it will perish. The good news is that Europe holds strong cards.\n\nThe US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every Maga voter’s pension is bound to the bubble’s precarious survival. AI investment now rivals consumer spending as the primary creator of American economic growth. It accounted for virtually all (92%) GDP growth in the first half of this year. Without it, US GDP grew only 0.1%. Despite Donald Trump’s posturing, he is on shaky economic ground.\n\nTrump’s political coalition is shaky, too. In July and again this month, he has been unable to force Senate Republicans to pass his AI moratorium bill, which would have prevented states from drafting their own AI laws. The Steve Bannon wing of Maga fears that AI will displace workers en masse, and is appalled by what children are exposed to on digital platforms. Maga voters particularly mistrust big tech’s political power. Tech is a dangerous topic for Trump.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has two cards to play that might pop the AI bubble. If she does so, Trump’s presidency will be thrown into crisis.\n\nFirst, Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon. These machines are essential for Nvidia, the AI microchip giant that is now the world’s most valuable company. ASML is one of Europe’s most valuable companies, and European banks and private equity are also invested in AI. Withholding these silicon-etching machines would be difficult for Europe, and extremely painful for the Dutch economy. But it would be far more painful for Trump.\n\nThe US’s feverish investment in AI and the datacentres it relies on will hit a wall if European export controls slow or stop exports to the US – and to Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its most advanced chips. Via this lever, Europe has the means to decide whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.\n\nSecond, and much easier for Europe, is the enforcement of the EU’s long-neglected data rules against big US tech companies. Confidential corporate documents made public in US litigation show how vulnerable companies such as Google can be to the enforcement of basic data rules. Meanwhile, Meta has been unable to tell a US court what its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.\n\nThis data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data. All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has been a wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.\n\nIf the EU had the gumption to apply this pressure, these US tech companies would have to rebuild their technologies from the ground up to handle data correctly. They would also have to tell investors that their AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable market until they comply. The AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock.\n\nMaga voters did not vote to lose their liberties and constitutional rights, and an increasingly authoritarian Trump who cannot deliver economic stability because of his closeness to a reviled tech industry is likely to be deeply unpopular in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe balance of risk now demands that European leaders cripple Trump. They have learned from a year of abject cowering before Trump that such behaviour only makes it easy for him to push them over. The reasons for caution are disappearing. The extreme reaction of Maga leaders to the relatively minor €120m fine the EC recently imposed on X shows that pulling punches will not placate them. Trump’s “28-point plan” for Ukraine dispelled any illusion that European concessions would secure a return to US military commitment.\n\nWith its democracy now explicitly under threat, Europe must join India, Brazil and China in standing up to Trump.\n\nBrazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an example of how to do so. He has been dignified and resolute in the face of extraordinary bullying from Trump. In a single month, in September, he proclaimed in an open letter to Trump that his country’s democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable, countered Trump’s tariffs with its own and passed a new law forcing digital platforms to protect children in Brazil from sexual harassment and other online harms.\n\nThen he rhetorically mugged Trump in a UN general assembly speech just before Trump’s turn to speak. As a result of Lula’s refusal to be cowed, Trump softened his tone immediately. Lower tariffs are now expected after negotiations between the two leaders.\n\nTrump said earlier in December that he thinks Europe’s leaders are weak. He does not believe they will defend Europeans’ liberties and their hard-won democracy against him. So far, the response from European leaders is proving him correct. But what Trump does not yet understand is that von der Leyen holds the US economy and his presidency in her hands. She must have the courage to go entirely beyond any prior norms of her behaviour. In other words, if she grabs Trump where it hurts, Europe will win this fight.\n\nJohnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties",

    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders finally got something to be happy about in Week 15. The team broke an eight-game losing streak by taking down the New York Giants.\n\nThere won't be any playoff games for the Commanders this year, but ending on a positive note and going into the offseason with positive momentum is important. The team will have to go the rest of the season without star quarterback Jayden Daniels, but Marcus Mariota has been serviceable in his place.\n\nOn Tuesday, the team announced a series of roster moves:\n\n- Placed WR Noah Brown on the Reserve/Injured List- Designated CB Darius Rush practice squad injured- Signed WR Chris Moore from the practice squad- Signed WR River Cracraft and TE Gee Scott Jr. to the practice squad\n\nWe have made the following roster moves:\n- Placed WR Noah Brown on the Reserve/Injured List\n- Designated CB Darius Rush practice squad injured\n- Signed WR Chris Moore from the practice squad\n- Signed WR River Cracraft and TE Gee Scott Jr. to the practice squad\n\n— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) December 16, 2025\n\nIt's disappointing to see Brown go back on the injured list. The receiver will end his season having only played in four games. Replacing Brown will be an old friend, Chris Moore, who is being promoted from the practice squad. Moore spent most of the season on the roster, but was released to make room for Brown and then re-signed to the practice squad.\n\nWide receiver River Cracraft will take Moore's practice squad spot, and tight end Gee Scott Jr. was also added to the practice squad. Cracraft will be on his second stint with Washington's practice squad this season.\n\nOver the last few weeks, some players could get a chance to impress and prove they belong in the league. The team has two games against the Philadelphia Eagles and one against the Dallas Cowboys remaining.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Announce roster moves ahead of Week 16",

    "fullText": "Pledge to invest billions in UK paused, with Washington citing lack of progress on trade barriers across pond\n\nThe US has paused its promised multi-billion-pound investment into British tech over trade disagreements, marking a serious setback in US-UK relations.\n\nThe £31bn “tech prosperity deal”, hailed by Keir Starmer as “a generational stepchange in our relationship with the US” when it was announced during Donald Trump’s state visit, has been put on ice by Washington.\n\nAs part of the deal, US tech companies pledged to spend billions in the UK, including a £22bn investment from Microsoft and £5bn from Google. But Washington has paused the implementation of the agreement, citing a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.\n\nBritish officials sought to downplay the development, which was first reported by the New York Times. The newspaper said Trump’s administration was unhappy about the UK continuing to levy a digital services tax on American tech companies and its food safety rules, which bar the export of certain agricultural products.\n\nOne British government source said it was “the usual bit of hardball negotiations by the Americans” and said that the deal to allow tariff-free British pharmaceutical exports to the US was on and off before it was finalised.\n\n“[The US commerce secretary] Howard Lutnick is a tough guy. We understand that the Americans negotiate incredibly hard but we’ll stand our ground. They want what’s best for their country, we want what’s best for ours,” the source said.\n\nA second government source said the development was “part of the shape of the negotiations” with Washington.\n\nThe prosperity deal included the creation of an artificial intelligence “growth zone” in the north-east of England, which UK officials said could bring in up to £30bn and create 5,000 jobs.\n\nBut the text of the agreement stated that it only “becomes operative alongside substantive progress being made to formalise and implement” it.\n\nThe decision to put it on hold is a blow to the UK government, which touted the agreement as a prize of its intensive year-long engagement with the US to avoid punitive tariffs on British exports. As part of his diplomatic charm offensive, Starmer hosted Trump for a second state visit at Windsor Castle in September, an unprecedented honour for a US president.\n\nStarmer has resisted US pressure to scrap or amend the digital services tax, a 2% levy on the revenues of tech companies including Amazon, Google and Apple that raises about £800m a year. Trump has repeatedly threatened to retaliate against countries with digital taxes, including the UK.\n\nThe Guardian revealed that during trade negotiations in the spring, the government drew up proposals to reduce the amount paid by US tech companies and by applying the tax to a wider range of companies without reducing its total take. But so far the tax has remained unchanged.\n\nThe US has also exerted pressure over the UK’s online safety rules, with officials promising to review their enforcement during the talks.\n\nA third area of contention has been the UK’s food safety regime, with ministers admitting that the US has raised objections to it. As part of the trade deal the government agreed to lower tariffs on some US agricultural products including beef, but it has stood by its manifesto commitment not to water down farming standards.\n\nAny decision to weaken these could open the door to American chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef being sold in Britain, a prospect that has long been highly controversial with farmers and consumer groups.\n\nAt a press conference at Chequers in September, where he unveiled the tech prosperity deal, Starmer said it had “the power to change lives” and “renewed the special relationship for a new era”.\n\n“It’s our chance to ensure that technologies like AI, quantum and others amplify human potential, solve problems, cure diseases, make us richer and freer, strengthen democracy not tyranny,” the prime minister said. “This is the territory on which the future will be won.”\n\nTrump at the time said the deal would help the US and UK “dominate” in the world of artificial intelligence and “ensure our countries lead the next great technological revolution side by side”.\n\nPeter Kyle, the business and trade secretary, was in the US last week for negotiations with Lutnick, the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, and the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Their discussions touched on whisky and steel tariffs and collaboration on critical minerals. Kyle’s department said talks were due to continue in January.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the tech prosperity deal delivers opportunity for hard-working people in both countries.”\n\nThe Guardian reported at the weekend that Starmer was poised to choose his new ambassador to Washington after interviewing the three finalists last week. The three shortlisted candidates are the prime minister’s business adviser, Varun Chandra, who was central to negotiating the prosperity deal; Christian Turner, the incoming ambassador to the UN; and Nigel Casey, the ambassador to Russia.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has revealed the White House’s domestic priority, and it’s not bringing down costs or addressing the looming healthcare crisis.\n\nSpeaking at a holiday party on Sunday, the president described his aspirations for a triumphal arch in Washington, D.C., as White House Domestic Policy Council head Vince Haley’s “primary thing.”\n\n“It’s something that is so special. Uh, it will be like the one in, in Paris, but to be honest with you, it blows it away. Blows it away in every way,” Trump said. “And Vince came in one day and his eyes were teeming. I mean, he couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. He saw it and he wanted to do that. That’s your primary thing.”\n\nHaley previously served as a speechwriter for Trump and as a longtime aide for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n\n“Vince is unbelievable on policy. And we have a policy thing that’s going to be unbelievable happening,” he said of the proposed arch.\n\nTrump has spent months attempting to remake D.C. in his MAGAfied image, including paving over the White House Rose Garden, demolishing the East Wing, breaking ground on a $300 million ballroom, and announcing plans for other new construction around the nation’s capital—none of which has undergone the necessary legal reviews.\n\nIn October, he announced he wanted to build a knock-off of the Arc de Triomphe that would rival the Lincoln Memorial in scale. Sources say Trump has been presented with three different designs, but unsurprisingly he is reportedly most excited about a $100 million white-and-gold monstrosity.\n\n“We’re building an arc, like the Arc de Triomphe, and we’re building it, uh, by the Arlington Bridge, the Arlington Cemetery, uh, opposite the Lincoln Memorial. You could say Jefferson, Washington, everything, ’cause they’re all right there,” Trump described the project on Sunday.\n\nThe president has solicited private donations for the project, which would ostensibly commemorate the 250th anniversary of the United States, and has doubled down on the idea even as his approval ratings have cratered over his administration’s failure to rein in the cost of living.\n\nThe president’s own voters increasingly blame him for high prices, and last week, Trump launched a national tour to try to convince voters his economic policies are working—despite the fact that many Americans are cutting back on buying gifts this holiday season.\n\nThen there’s the fact that Republicans still don’t have a plan for bringing down healthcare costs after the latest GOP spending bill cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending and failed to extend health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHealthcare premiums for about 22 million Americans will skyrocket next year after the ACA credits expire, with the average recipient seeing their premiums double.\n\nBut to Trump, the more pressing issue is apparently that Washington is “the only city in the world that’s of great importance that doesn’t have a triumphal arch,” he said Sunday.\n\n“This one is gonna blow ‘em all away. The one that people know mostly is the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France. And, uh, we’re gonna top it by I think a lot,” he said.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",
