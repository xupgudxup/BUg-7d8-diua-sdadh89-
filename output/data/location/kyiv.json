    "fullText": "Kyiv officials warned that Ukrainians might be coerced into registering Starlink terminals for the Kremlin's forces after a recent block on Russia's access to the service.\n\nUkraine's auxiliary body for handling prisoners of war posted a notice on Tuesday saying that it had learned of multiple instances where families of Ukrainian prisoners were threatened and told to enroll such terminals.\n\nThe warning comes after Ukraine's defense ministry reached a deal with SpaceX earlier this month to cut off Russia's access to Starlink by blocking general connectivity across Ukrainian territory.\n\n\"Looking for a way out of the difficult situation in which they found themselves, the occupiers turned their attention to the families of the prisoners,\" the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War wrote in a statement.\n\n\"Cases of threats and demands to officially register Starlink terminals have been recorded,\" it added.\n\nTo maintain Starlink access, Ukrainian troops, civilians, and businesses must register individual terminals to a \"whitelist,\" either online or at municipal centers.\n\nThe sweeping move aimed to curb a black-market loophole that Russian forces were exploiting. In compliance with US sanctions, SpaceX doesn't do business with Russia, but Ukraine has repeatedly said that Russian troops were obtaining terminals and using them to guide attack and reconnaissance drones.\n\nIn its latest statement, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said that officials could trace the registration of terminals that were later used by Russian forces because enrollment requires an ID.\n\n\"If the terminal is used to control drones that destroy infrastructure and take lives, the fact of registering the terminal by a citizen of Ukraine is grounds for criminal prosecution,\" the agency added.\n\nRussia is not known to have a satellite internet service that compares to Starlink's in terms of speed, availability, and stability.\n\n\"For the enemy, Starlink is so important that they have deployed a whole network to search for traitors who are ready to register Starlink for themselves in the Central Administrative Service,\" wrote Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov, a drone analyst and an advisor to Ukraine's defense ministry, in a Telegram statement on Sunday.\n\nIn some cases, Russian troops were offering up to $230 to register a single terminal, Beskrestnov added. That's roughly a third of the median monthly salary in Ukraine.\n\nFor the Kremlin's forces, the service disruption has been significant enough that pro-Russian military bloggers have reported that most Russian units now lack internet access. Some have blamed Moscow for what they called a reliance on Western technology, even as the US and Europe explicitly back Ukraine.\n\n\"It's about to suddenly become clear that units cannot operate effectively without communications. That'll be news to some in high places,\" one blogger, under the handle Belarusian Silovik, wrote.\n\nDenying Russian access to Starlink had long been a priority for Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, who had previously advocated such measures while serving as minister for digital transformation.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — It is pre-dawn in the historic Podil district of the Ukraine capital, Kyiv, and warm light from the Spelta bakery-bistro’s window pierces the darkness outside. On a wooden surface dusted with flour, the baker Oleksandr Kutsenko skilfully divides and shapes soft, damp pieces of dough. As he shoves the first loaves into the oven, a sweet, delicate aroma of fresh bread fills the space.\n\nWhat economic risks do energy attacks pose to Ukraine?\n\nHow are labor shortages impacting Ukrainian companies?\n\nHow are power outages affecting Ukrainian business operations?\n\nWhat additional costs are Ukrainian businesses facing during wartime?\n\nSeconds later the lights go out, the ovens switch off and darkness envelops the room. Kutsenko, 31, steps outside into the freezing night, switches on a large rectangular generator and the power kicks back in. It’s a pattern that will be repeated many times as the business struggles to keep working through the power outages caused by Russia’s bombing campaign on Ukraine's energy grid.\n\n“It’s now more than impossible to imagine a Ukrainian business operating without a generator,” said Olha Hrynchuk, the co-founder and head baker of Spelta.\n\nThe cost of purchasing and operating generators to overcome power outages is just one of many challenges facing Ukrainian businesses after nearly four years of war. Acute labor shortages due to mobilization and war-related migration, security risks, declining purchasing power and complicated logistics add to the pressure, officials say.\n\nHrynchuk, 28, opened the bakery 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. That winter was the first year Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy system. Hrynchuk says they barely know what it is to work under “normal” conditions, but have never faced the challenges they do now.\n\nProduction is entirely dependent on electricity and the generator burns about 700 hryvnias ($16) worth of fuel per hour.\n\n“We run on a generator for 10 to 12 hours a day. You have no fixed schedule — you have to adapt and refuel it at the same time,” Hrynchuk said.\n\nOlha Nasonova, 52, who is head of the Restaurants of Ukraine analytical center, says the industry is experiencing its most difficult period of the past 20 years.\n\nWhile businesses were prepared for electricity cuts, no one expected such a cold winter and it’s been especially tough for small cafés and family-run establishments, because they have the least financial resources.\n\nThe “Best Way to Cup” project, which has two venues and roasts and grinds its own coffee, is on the brink of permanent closure. Co-founder Yana Bilym, 33, who opened the cafe in May, said a Russian attack shattered all its windows and glass doors in August. Bilym said the cost of renovation was 150,000 hryvnias (about $3,400), half of which she financed with a bank loan that she only recently finished repaying.",

    "fullText": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Russian missiles and drones have pounded Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks, plunging people into frozen darkness in one of the country’s coldest winters on record.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of illegally targeting power infrastructure during the war to deny civilians light, heating and running water.\n\n\"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorize people is more important to Russia than diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, on the eve of a new round of talks about ending the conflict and as temperatures in Kyiv hovered around minus 20 C (minus 3 F).\n\nRussia says its attacks are a legitimate part of its military campaign against its neighbor. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine itself is widely regarded as an illegal act of aggression.\n\nSo, are attacks on energy installations allowed during war?\n\nCombatants can legally target a power grid if the attack “directly affects a valid military target” — but they cannot cause excessive civilian casualties, said David Crane, former chief prosecutor at the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n\nIn the case of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, “the indiscriminate and widespread targeting does not come close to what is legal,” he said in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says that parts of energy systems providing essential services to civilians “are in principle civilian objects, and as such are protected against direct attack and reprisals as well as incidental harm.”\n\nPretrial judges from the International Criminal Court, in fact, issued arrest warrants in 2024 for top Russian military brass and the country’s former defense minister for their alleged involvement in missile strikes targeting electricity infrastructure.\n\nIn announcing warrants for former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia’s chief military officer, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the court said that judges found “reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged strikes were directed against civilian objects, and for those installations that may have qualified as military objectives at the relevant time, the expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage.”\n\nRussia is not a member of the court, rejects its jurisdiction, and refuses to extradite suspects to face justice in the ICC’s courtrooms in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe Russian military has repeatedly said that it has targeted energy facilities and other infrastructure that support Ukrainian military industries and armed forces. It has denied targeting residential areas despite daily evidence to the contrary.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted Wednesday that “our military is striking the targets that they believe are associated with the military complex of the Kyiv regime, the operation is continuing.”\n\nKyiv accuses Russia of seeking to wear down Ukrainians’ appetite for the fight by inflicting grinding hardship on civilians forced to live in dark, freezing homes.\n\nAuthorities say Russia has tried to cripple Ukraine's electricity network by targeting substations, transformers, turbines and generators at power plants. Ukraine’s largest private power company, DTEK, said that this week's overnight attack was the ninth major assault on the company’s thermal power plants since October.\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.",

    "fullText": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — There’s a chance the dreaded buzz of propellers heard on Ukrainian battlefields is coming from drones built in a country with a population of just over a million on Europe’s southeastern fringe: Cyprus.\n\nManufacturer Swarmly says there are more than 200 of its H-10 Poseidon drones helping Ukrainian artillery batteries pinpoint enemy targets on the ground in all kinds of weather, racking up more than 100,000 hours in the air over the last three years.\n\nIts 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) factory, where the whir of grinders shaping composite plastics reverberates off the walls, has become a major source of uncrewed vehicles shipped to countries such as Indonesia, Benin, Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia, according to company officials. Most of the factory floor is reserved for uncrewed aerial vehicle manufacture. But tucked in a secure storage area is a selection of Swarmly's super-fast marine drones replete with high-definition cameras and .50-caliber machine guns.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has driven even the smallest European Union member countries to develop their home-grown, high-tech defense industries, just as necessity has made Kyiv a world leader in cutting-edge UAV technology. Many EU countries have partnered with Kyiv to develop that technology, and Ukraine’s front lines are usually their testing grounds.\n\nLike Cyprus, the Baltic countries and Denmark have revved up their domestic drone and counter-drone technology. In Greece, drones are part of a 25-billion euro ($29-billion) overhaul of its armed forces.\n\n“The example of Swarmy, as well as other important companies based in small EU countries, is a testament to the serious effort made by the private sector in Europe to innovate and build mass production capacity of defense items, including uncrewed systems,” said Federico Borsari, an expert with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nUAVs are reshaping warfare by offering less militarily capable countries some leverage over superior adversaries. Drones aren't going to completely replace big-ticket weaponry like tanks, artillery and warplanes, said Borsari. But they offer flexibility and bang for the buck, making them a formidable force multiplier.\n\nTake Swarmly's explosives-packed, satellite-guided Hydra marine drone. Each one costs 80,000 euros ($94,500), which means deploying a group of them to neutralize a billion-euro warship can be a bargain, said company director Gary Rafalovsky.\n\nThis sort of naval weapon taking out a much larger warship is already evidenced by Houthi attacks from Yemen, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for missile technologies and UAVs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Europe.\n\nBarriers to entry for undercapitalized companies are low, he added, because UAVs are often designed and assembled from components cheaply and readily available on the global market.\n\n“And that, of course, means that basically you don’t have to have a great industrial investment at first that you need with other military capabilities. You don’t need decades of experience in certain material sciences or these kinds of things,” Hinz said.\n\nIn Denmark, a pair of companies focusing on anti-drone devices have reported a surge in new clients, and some of the devices were to be shipped to Ukraine to assist in jamming Russian technology on the battlefield. Ukraine in September said it was partnering with Danish companies to build missile and drone components at a factory in Denmark.\n\nIn the Baltic country of Lithuania, scientists and business partners have joined forces under the name VILNIUS TECH to develop UAVs, automated mine detection and other military technologies. The state-run ammunition factory Giraite says it has increased production capacity by 50% since 2022.\n\nGreece for the first time showcased its homemade drones and counter-drone technology during a full tactical exercise in November as NATO urged Europe's defense sector to pick up the pace.\n\n“We need capabilities, equipment, real firepower and the most advanced technology,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned during a visit to Romania earlier that month. “Bring your ideas, test your ingenuity and use NATO as your test bed.”\n\nEven as drone development accelerates, Borsari cautioned that the advantages of UAVs are often tempered by numerous variables like the harsh conditions in which they sometimes fly, operators’ training and skill levels, as well as the depth of logistical support to keep them functional.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the Trump administration’s mixed messages that have strained relations with NATO allies have forced European leaders to reckon with the need to become more self-reliant on defense. So the EU has made billions of euros available to encourage investment and bolster its collective deterrent capability.\n\nThat's been a boost to nations like Cyprus, which assumed the six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1. Last week, the EU’s executive arm approved financial assistance for eight members including Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is set to receive final approval from EU leaders for some 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in low-cost, long-term loans under the EU’s 150-billion-euro joint ($177-billion) procurement program called Security Action for Europe (SAFE).\n\nIts nascent defense industry is already made up of around 30 companies and research centers that produce technology for both civilian and military sectors, including robotics, communications networks, anti-drone systems and even satellite communications and surveillance, said Panayiotis Hadjipavlis, chief of the armaments and defense capabilities development directorate within Cyprus' Defense Ministry.\n\n“We have niche capabilities on very high-tech products and this has to be taken seriously into account,” Hadjipavlis told The Associated Press in his office, where the helmet from his fighter pilot days hung on a nearby coat rack.\n\nMajor defense industry players, he added, are among those who should take note.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Russia has largely observed a ceasefire on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as Kyiv prepared for the next round of trilateral talks on how ​to end the war.\n\nZelenskiy said that Russia had not carried out any targeted missile or drone strikes ‌on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the past 24 hours, but steady Russian shelling hit energy facilities near the front line.\n\n\"The de-escalation measures... are ‌helping to build public trust in the negotiation process and its possible outcome. The war needs to be ended,\" Zelenskiy said after he met his negotiating team ahead of the next round of peace talks with Russian and U.S. officials scheduled to take place this week in Abu Dhabi. \"Ukraine is ready for real steps. We believe it is realistic to achieve a ⁠dignified and lasting peace.\"\n\nIn his nightly ‌video address, Zelenskiy noted that Russian forces had continued to shell Ukrainian positions and logistics, damaging transmission lines and other sites in parts of the southeastern Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nHe ‍said the pause in strikes on energy infrastructure underscored the fact that U.S. efforts to pursue negotiations to end the war were having an impact.\n\n\"This demonstrates that when the United States has the motivation to genuinely change the situation, the situation can indeed ​change,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nRussia and Ukraine said last week they halted strikes on each other's energy infrastructure, but disagreed ‌on the timeframe for the truce.\n\nThe Kremlin said U.S. President Donald Trump had made a personal request to Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from striking Kyiv until February 1. Zelenskiy said the truce was supposed to last for a week, starting January 30.\n\nUKRAINE STRUGGLES TO RESTORE POWER SUPPLIES\n\nUkraine is struggling to restore its battered energy system and secure electricity and heat for the population after several large Russian strikes this month. Repair work has been complicated by ⁠bitterly cold temperatures.\n\n\"Today we are coming to the critical point. We ​need some time to recover what is destroyed for the last ​three months,\" said Maxim Timchenko, CEO of private energy producer DTEK. \"Energy ceasefire is extremely important for us to recover partly and avoid any tragic consequences because of no power supply.\"\n\nDTEK said on ‍Monday one of its coal ⁠mining enterprises in the Dnipropetrovsk region had been attacked for the second time in 24 hours. The previous strike on Sunday killed 12 miners, the company said.\n\nZelenskiy also said Russian forces were focusing on ⁠attacking transport logistics, especially railway infrastructure.\n\nRegional officials said that a Russian strike had killed a father and a son, and wounded two children and ‌their mother in the frontline Donetsk region.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The terms of a Russian commitment to U.S. President Donald Trump to temporarily halt its bombardment of Ukraine during one of the country's bleakest winters in years remained unclear Friday, as Ukrainians braced for even worse conditions to come next week.\n\nTrump said late Thursday that President Vladimir Putin had agreed to a temporary pause in targeting Kyiv and other places as the region experiences freezing temperatures that have brought widespread hardship to civilians.\n\n“I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week during this ... extraordinary cold,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. Putin has “agreed to that,” he said, without elaborating on when the request to the Russian leader was made.\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a query seeking clarity about the scope and timing of any limited pause.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed Friday that Trump “made a personal request” to Putin to stop targeting Kyiv until Feb. 1 “in order to create favorable conditions for negotiations.”\n\nThe mention of Feb. 1 was confusing since that is only two days away. Also, the cold weather is forecast to get much worse from Sunday, with temperatures dropping even further and making the time frame for a pause in attacks hard to understand.\n\nRussia has sought to deny Ukrainian civilians heat, light and running water over the course of the war, in a strategy that Ukrainian officials describe as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nAsked if Moscow agreed to Trump’s proposal, Peskov said, “Yes, of course.” But he refused to answer further questions about whether the agreement covered only energy infrastructure or all aerial strikes, and when the halt on strikes was supposed to start.\n\nRussia struck Ukrainian energy assets in several regions of Ukraine on Thursday but there were no strikes on those facilities overnight, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday.\n\nIn a post on social media, Zelenskyy also noted that Russia has turned its attention to targeting Ukrainian logistics networks and that Russian drones and missiles hit residential areas of Ukraine overnight, as they have most nights during the war.\n\nTrump framed Putin's acceptance as a concession. But Zelenskyy was skeptical as Russia’s invasion approaches its fourth anniversary on Feb. 24 with no sign that Moscow is willing to reach a peace settlement despite a U.S.-led push to end the fighting.\n\n“I do not believe that Russia wants to end the war. There is a great deal of evidence to the contrary,” Zelenskyy said Thursday. Ukraine is ready to halt its attacks on Russia’s energy infrastructure, including oil refineries, if Moscow also stops its bombardment of the Ukrainian power grid and other energy assets, he said.\n\nRussia fired 111 drones and one ballistic missile at Ukraine overnight, injuring at least three people, the Ukrainian Air Force said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that its air defenses overnight shot down 18 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions, as well as the illegally annexed Crimea and the Black Sea.\n\nForecasters say Kyiv, which recently endured severe power shortages, will see a brutally cold stretch starting Friday that is expected to last into next week. Temperatures in some areas will drop to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit), the State Emergency Service said.\n\nThe possibility of a respite in energy sector attacks was discussed at last weekend’s meeting in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, between envoys of Ukraine, Russia and the United States, Zelenskyy said, adding that he had agreed to adhere to a “reciprocal approach” on energy assaults.\n\n“If Russia does not strike us, we will … take corresponding steps,” he told reporters.\n\nFurther talks were expected on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, but that could change because of a spike in tensions between the United States and Iran.\n\nIt was unclear whether and how any partial truce might work amid ongoing wider fighting and mistrust between the two countries.\n\n“There is no ceasefire. There is no official agreement on a ceasefire, as is typically reached during negotiations,” Zelenskyy said. “There has been no direct dialogue and no direct agreements on this matter between us and Russia.”\n\nUkraine had originally proposed a limited energy ceasefire at talks in Saudi Arabia last year, Zelenskyy said, but it gained no traction.\n\nDisagreement over what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory, and Moscow’s demand for possession of territory it hasn’t captured, are a key issue holding up a peace deal, according to Zelenskyy.\n\n“We have repeatedly said that we are ready for compromises that lead to a real end to the war, but that are in no way related to changes to Ukraine’s territorial integrity,” Zelenskyy said. “The American side understands this and says that there is a compromise solution regarding a free economic zone.”\n\nUkraine demands control over such a zone, he said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

Musk turned on Starlink service over Ukraine in 2022 ‍after Kyiv pleaded for help in the first days following Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nDespite Musk's subsequent clashes with Ukrainian officials over his views on the war, Ukraine's military still relies on tens of thousands of Starlinks for battlefield communication and for piloting ​some drone missions.\n\nThey are favoured for their stable connection on the battlefield and for their resistance to ‌enemy signal jamming.\n\nIn a social media post in February 2024, SpaceX said it does not sell or ship Starlink to Russia, and \"does not do business of any kind with the Russian Government or its military\".\n\nThe U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said it had seen reports of Russia using Starlink-equipped Shahed long-range drones beginning in September 2024.\n\n'HUNDREDS' OF STARLINK-EQUIPPED DRONES\n\nSerhiy Beskrestnov, a newly appointed adviser to Fedorov, drew attention to the issue ⁠over the past week by posting pictures on social media ​of the wreckage of long-range Russian drones, including Shaheds, with Starlink ​terminals.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beskrestnov said that Shahed drones manually flown by pilots, possibly through Starlink, had attacked a passenger train in northeastern Ukraine. That attack killed five people, and was denounced ‍by Kyiv as an act ⁠of terrorism.\n\nOn Thursday, Beskrestnov said there had been \"hundreds\" of cases where Starlink-enabled Russian drones had attacked Ukraine.\n\n\"The complexity of this process lies in the fact that Starlink cannot be suppressed by means of ⁠electronic warfare, and even their position in flight cannot be detected by reconnaissance equipment,\" he wrote, adding that the way to solve ‌the issue was therefore through SpaceX.",

    "description": "In a major shift for Ukraine's military, Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko are now officially advising Kyiv on defense tech and drones.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, has appointed two prominent Telegram bloggers and activists to his \"team of new leaders,\" saying they will advise him on defense technology and drone warfare.\n\nThe move is a major recognition for the pair — Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko — who are among the most influential voices among the volunteers filling vital gaps in logistics and drone expertise for Ukraine's battered military.\n\nBeskrestnov, widely cited among Ukrainians as an expert on drones, runs a Telegram channel with some 156,000 followers, where he publicly analyzes Russian and Ukrainian battle drones and how they've performed.\n\nFedorov named him an advisor in defense technology on Sunday, saying Beskrestnov would focus on helping Ukraine build counter-systems for Russian strike and reconnaissance drones.\n\nIn his statement, Fedorov said that Beskrestnov would also support Ukraine's military in analyzing Russian tech, studying \"logistics, study of enemy solutions, and leveraging this experience to our advantage.\"\n\nSternenko, a political activist who now runs an organization that raises funds for military drones, was appointed as Fedorov's advisor on Thursday.\n\n\"From now on, Serhii will act as my advisor on enhancing the use of UAVs at the frontline. His experience will help us implement our shared vision of improving the effectiveness of units operating unmanned systems,\" Fedorov said.\n\nThe Sternenko Foundation serves as a hub for drone procurement, raising money to buy specialized first-person-view drones for military units that demonstrate they're combat-effective.\n\nAs of Monday, it says it has delivered over 256,000 drones on demand to Ukrainian units.\n\nFedorov, Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister at 35, previously was the country's minister for digital transformation. Since being confirmed to his new role earlier this month, he's pledged to revitalize Ukraine's military, promising to reform its training programs, internal culture, and organizational doctrine.\n\nAppointing Sternenko and Beskrestnov as advisors is a significant change in how Kyiv treats its grassroots movements. These groups work closely with Ukrainian forces, but top authorities have generally been slow to officially recognize or integrate them.\n\nSeveral frontline units previously told Business Insider that they sometimes rely on the Sternenko Foundation, for example, for drones that can effectively cope with Russian electronic warfare. While the Ukrainian military provides its fighters with drones in bulk, these sometimes need further tweaks as the battlefield evolves rapidly.\n\nVolunteer foundations often step in and have become known for their speed, leveraging connections with drone manufacturers and informal logistics networks to deliver priority supplies, vehicles, and modified drones within hours or days.\n\nFedorov said that Sternenko would particularly assist in establishing basic support for drone units, adding that 50 of Ukraine's 400 units account for 70% of its battlefield engagements.\n\n\"The objective is to enable the other 350 units to grow quickly and significantly increase the scale of destroying Russian forces,\" Fedorov said.\n\nBeskrestnov, meanwhile, regularly publicizes news about Russia's Shahed-type drones. He often posts footage from found wreckage to show how the Kremlin has been modifying or upgrading the loitering munitions.\n\nFedorov's team credited the drone analyst for being the \"first to report on the use by Russians of FPV drones equipped with machine vision, as well as the use of jet-powered Shahed drones.\"\n\nThe new defense minister's attempt to reshape Ukraine's military comes as it grapples with a slew of challenges, including heightened fighting intensity on the front lines in recent months and a withdrawal of most US miliary support.\n\nIn his opening speech to Ukraine's parliament, Fedorov said the country was facing a high rate of desertion and draft dodging, and that the military's budget had shrunk since last year.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Olena Janchuk spends another day of freezing isolation in her high-rise apartment.\n\nThe former kindergarten teacher has severe rheumatoid arthritis, and has been trapped for weeks on the 19th floor of her Kyiv tower block, 650 steps from the ground.\n\nLong daily blackouts caused by Russia’s bombardment of power plants and transmission lines have made working elevators a luxury.\n\nWith January temperatures plummeting to minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), there’s a permanent line of frost on the inside of Janchuk’s windows, white patterns creeping across the glass by morning.\n\nThe 53-year-old huddles over a makeshift fireplace of candles arranged beneath stacked bricks, designed to absorb and slowly release heat. USB charging cables snake across the floor from overloaded power strips, while her electric blanket is hooked up to a power bank rationed for the coldest hours.\n\n“When there’s no light and heat for seventeen and a half hours, you have to come up with something,” she said. “The bricks work best in a small room, so we stay in there.”\n\nKyiv, a city of about 3 million people, is dominated by tower blocks, many from the Soviet era, now left without power for most of the day.\n\nIn this fourth winter of war, electricity is a rationed commodity.\n\nResidents plan their lives around electricity schedules: when to cook, shower, charge phones and run washing machines. Food is chosen for shelf life, water filtered into bottles and stored in buckets. Small camping gas burners are used to heat soup or tea when the power is out.\n\nSleep is fractured by air raid sirens and the need to use electricity during off-peak hours.\n\nOutside, across snow-covered Kyiv, diesel generators rumble on commercial streets. Shoppers navigate aisles using phone flashlights, and bars glow by candlelight.\n\nApps notify users of narrowing electricity windows — usually just a few hours — enough for a household reboot.\n\nLife gets harder on the higher floors\n\nJanchuk’s 22-story building is located near a power station and residents can see the missile and drone attacks firsthand, flashes lighting up the horizon at night.\n\nDuring blackouts, they climb the stairs in darkness, phone lights bouncing off concrete steps, often accompanied by the echo of children and barking dogs. People sometimes leave plastic bags with cookies or water inside elevators for those who get stuck when the power cuts midride.\n\nJanchuk’s husband, out working most of the day, brings the groceries in the evening while her mother, 72-year-old Lyudmila Bachurina, is in charge of chores.\n\n“It’s cold, but we manage,” the mother says, holding a square USB-charged flashlight she recently mounted on the wall. “When the lights come on, I start turning on the washing machine, fill up water bottles, cook food, charge power banks, run around the kitchen and run around the house.”\n\nIn upscale neighborhoods, residents pool funds for generators to keep elevators running. But most blocks — home to pensioners, families and people with disabilities — cannot afford them.\n\nDisability advocates, including groups representing wounded war veterans, say staircases have become an invisible social barrier, cutting people off inside their own homes.\n\nThey are urging city officials to fund generators for residential buildings.\n\nUntil then, life bends around the electricity timetable. USB lamps, power banks and inverter batteries have become household staples. Telegram chats help neighbors check on the elderly and swap blackout updates.\n\nFrom upper floors, Kyivans look out over a skyline of high rises and the city’s historic golden-domed churches. At night, flashes of explosions are visible as Russia continues its campaign against Ukraine’s energy system.\n\nRussia has inflicted vast damage on Ukraine’s infrastructure\n\nToo many power stations and transmission lines have been hit to meet demand, even with electricity imports from Europe. To prevent a grid collapse, operators impose rolling blackouts, keeping hospitals and critical services alive while homes go dark.\n\nAt one coal-fired power plant struck repeatedly, shift supervisor Yuriy walks through wreckage of charred machinery, collapsed roofs and control panels melted into useless lumps.

Photographs of colleagues killed on the job hang near the entrance.\n\n“After missile and drone attacks, the consequences are terrible — large-scale,” he said.\n\nOfficials asked that the plant’s location and Yuriy’s full name not be disclosed for security reasons.\n\n“Our energy equipment has been destroyed. It is expensive,” Yuriy said. “Right now, we’re restoring what we can.”\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nKyiv has repeatedly updated its austere winter power-saving schedule, dimming or cutting streetlights in low-traffic areas and investing in less centralized power generation.\n\nIn the tower blocks, restoration feels far off.\n\n“I’m tired, really tired, to be honest. When you can’t go outside, when you don’t see the sun, when there’s no light and you can’t even go to the store on your own. … It wears you down,” Bachurina said.\n\n“But the important thing, as all Ukrainians say now, is that we will endure anything until the war ends.”\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - Russia launched another vast attack on Ukraine's energy system in the small hours of Saturday, rocking Kyiv with explosions throughout the night and leaving ​1.2 million properties without power countrywide.\n\nNearly 6,000 buildings in the capital were left without heating ‌on Saturday morning as temperatures hovered around -10 degrees Celsius (14 F). Many residents' apartments were already freezing cold from disruption to the ‌city's centralised heat distribution system following previous attacks.\n\nMoscow carried out the strikes as trilateral, U.S.-brokered talks between Russia and Ukraine continued into a second day in the UAE, with no sign of compromise on Friday.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said one person was killed in the capital city and four injured, including three being treated ⁠in hospital, while 19 people including ‌a child were wounded in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv.\n\nRussia, which has pummelled Ukraine's power grid since its full-scale invasion in 2022, is conducting its heaviest bombardment campaign ‍on energy facilities this winter, leaving people across Ukraine with only a few hours of power a day and some without heat or water.\n\nOver 800,000 people in the capital and another 400,000 in the northern region of Chernihiv ​were without power after the latest attacks, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said.\n\nUkraine's air force said ‌Russia had unleashed 375 drones and 21 missiles, including two of its rarely deployed Tsirkon ballistic missiles, in its overnight attack.\n\nThe sky over Kyiv was lit up by regular orange flashes as air defences fired on missiles and drones descending on the capital, with loud booms echoing around the city's tall buildings.\n\nTymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, reported strikes in at least four districts. A medical facility was ⁠among the buildings damaged.\n\nBefore Saturday, Kyiv had already endured two ​mass overnight attacks since the New Year that have knocked ​out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings.\n\nEmergency workers were still engaged in restoring services to residents that had been knocked out by those attacks, and Klitschko said ‍many of the buildings ⁠that had lost heating on Saturday had only recently had it restored.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a frequent target 30 km (18 miles) from the Russian border and much closer to eastern battlefronts, Mayor Ihor ⁠Terekhov said 25 drones had hit several districts.\n\nWriting on Telegram, Terekhov said the drones had struck a dormitory for displaced people ‌and two medical facilities including a maternity hospital.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces fired nearly $100 million worth of air defense missiles battling Russia's latest bombardment, Kyiv revealed on Tuesday, offering insight into the war's growing financial toll.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that the Russian attack, which began Monday night and continued into Tuesday, forced Kyiv to launch around €80 million (roughly $94 million) worth of interceptor missiles.\n\n\"Imagine that — the cost of these missiles,\" Zelenskyy said over WhatsApp in response to a question about interceptor stockpiles.\n\nThe staggering figure covers only the interceptor missiles and does not appear to account for any other munitions expended to defend against the Russian attack, which also included hundreds of drones.\n\nRussia launched 18 ballistic missiles, 15 cruise missiles, and one anti-ship missile overnight, according to data from Ukraine's air force. It said in a statement that 27 were shot down, while five hit their targets.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia has \"significantly increased\" its use of ballistic missiles and has been able to obtain critical technology for the munitions from third-party countries and from industry.\n\n\"Nevertheless, their ability to produce these missiles must be reduced — and that is not happening yet,\" he said in response to another question.\n\nAlthough Ukraine has received some additional air defense systems from Western countries, Zelenskyy said more are still needed, along with additional interceptor missiles to keep pace with Russia's attacks.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged that it has been difficult for Ukraine to obtain the necessary interceptor missiles. He specifically singled out the PAC-3, which has a $3.7 million price tag and is fired from US-made Patriot batteries, as the best chance Kyiv has to defeat Russian ballistic missiles.\n\n\"War is an extremely expensive Russian luxury, and for us it results in severe losses,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussian missiles are not the only worry for Ukraine. Moscow's overnight attack involved 339 drones. Kyiv said its Air Force shot down 315 of them. Two dozen hit their targets.\n\nTo preserve its costly air defense missiles, Ukraine has been increasingly relying on locally made interceptor drones that cost as little as a few thousand dollars to hunt down and destroy Russian drones.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine is producing around 1,000 interceptor drones each day, a goal he set last summer. The challenge now, he said, is that the number of drones has outpaced the number of operators who can control them.\n\n\"Therefore, now we must catch up in terms of the number of interceptor groups — the corresponding mobile groups,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he has tasked senior Ukrainian military leadership with bridging the gap.",

    "fullText": "Jan 19 (Reuters) - Russia launched a barrage of drone strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight on Monday, cutting off power in five regions ​across the country amid freezing temperatures and high demand, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nThe ‌Ukrainian air force said that Russian troops had launched 145 drones. Air defence units shot down 126 ‌of them, it said.\n\n\"As of this morning, consumers in Sumy, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv regions are without power,\" the energy ministry said in a statement. \"Emergency repair work is underway if the security situation allows.\"\n\nIn the southern Odesa region, energy and gas ⁠infrastructure was damaged, the regional ‌governor said, adding that one person was hurt in the attack.\n\nDTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, said its energy facility in ‍Odesa was \"substantially\" damaged, knocking out power for 30,800 households.\n\nA local power grid company in northern Chernihiv region said that five important energy facilities were damaged, leaving tens of thousands of consumers ​without power.\n\nRussia also hit Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv with missiles on ‌Monday morning, significantly damaging a critical infrastructure facility, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.\n\nMoscow has stepped up a winter campaign of strikes on the Ukrainian energy system, including generation, electricity transmission and gas production facilities, amid freezing temperatures that complicate repair works.\n\nThe attacks have caused long blackouts.\n\n\"Being without electricity for more than 16 hours is awful,\" Serhii ⁠Kovalenko, CEO of energy distribution company Yasno, said ​on Facebook late on Sunday. \"And it's not because ​of the energy companies, but because of cynical attacks by the enemy, who is trying to create a humanitarian disaster.\"\n\nUkraine declared an ‍energy emergency last week ⁠as its grid crumbled due to accumulated wartime damage and a new targeted wave of Russian bombardments.\n\nEnergy Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Monday the ⁠government would implement projects to improve electricity transmission from the western part of the country to its ‌power-hungry east.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A majority of Ukrainians would strongly oppose withdrawing troops from the part of the eastern Donetsk region still ​controlled by Kyiv in exchange for European and U.S. security guarantees, a ‌poll released on Friday indicated.\n\nUkraine, wary of unmet commitments in the past, is pushing for legally binding ‌security guarantees to prevent any future Russian aggression.\n\nUkraine is under U.S. pressure to agree quickly to a peace deal, but has refused to accept Russian demands that it cede land it still controls in eastern Donbas, a large mineral-rich industrial area comprising the ⁠Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\nRussia controls ‌almost all of Luhansk, but Kyiv still holds about 20% of Donetsk, including a string of strategically vital garrison towns and defensive ‍lines.\n\nAccording to the poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), 54% of Ukrainians categorically reject the idea of withdrawing from parts of Donbas in return for security reassurances from allies.\n\nSome ​39% said they would reluctantly accept.\n\n\"Moreover, those who are ready to agree expect ‌quite significant security guarantees. Therefore, if the level of security guarantees is lower than expected, approval of such a proposal will be even lower,\" said KIIS executive director Anton Hrushetskyi.\n\nThe survey was conducted in early January among 601 respondents on Ukrainian-controlled territory.\n\nAlmost 70% did not believe current negotiations would lead to a lasting peace.\n\nSome 57% believed ⁠Russia would attack again in the event ​of a ceasefire at the current frontlines and security ​guarantees from allies.\n\nHowever, even if security guarantees were given, 40% believed the U.S. would not provide support in the event of renewed Russian ‍invasion, while 39% ⁠thought it would.\n\nRussia has publicly shown little interest in scaling down its demands and made few comments regarding the 20-point peace framework that Ukraine and the ⁠U.S. have been trying to finalise.\n\nInstead, Russia has stepped up air strikes, significantly damaging already shattered ‌energy infrastructure and leaving millions without power and heating in freezing temperatures.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Yuliia Dysa; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves ​of Russian attacks on its infrastructure, mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters on Friday.\n\nKyiv, one of Eastern ‌Europe's largest cities, requires 1,700 megawatts of electricity to power the services for its 3.6 million people, Klitschko said.\n\nKlitschko said the current energy crisis ‌was the most difficult challenge facing the capital in the nearly four years since Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\n\"It's the first time in the history of our city that, in such severe frosts, most of the city was left without heating and with a huge shortage of electricity,\" Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, said in an interview ⁠in his office at the heart of ‌Kyiv.\n\nSome Kyiv residents face up to 18 to 20 hours a day without mains electricity. Ukraine declared an energy emergency this week as its grid crumbles due to accumulated wartime ‍damage and a new targeted wave of Russian bombardments.\n\nBitter cold weather with icy rain and snow exacerbated the challenges. Nighttime minimum temperatures have dipped to around -17 Celsius (1 Fahrenheit) in Kyiv this week.\n\nFAST REPAIRS, GENERATORS AND INTERNATIONAL AID\n\nKlitschko said Ukraine's international partners had ​rushed in additional generators, and repair teams had worked round the clock to restore heating following a Russian ‌strike last week that knocked out supplies to 6,000 apartment buildings.\n\nAbout 100 buildings still have no heating, he said.\n\n\"We're not just working during the day now, we're working at night too,\" he said. \"There is no such thing as the start and end of the working day for us.\"\n\nIn addition to repairs and generators, the city opened about 1,300 sites with heaters to help residents keep warm, and was working to install mini thermal power stations in ⁠some districts to decentralize electricity and heating.\n\nWith generators, the priority was ​to provide electricity to ensure water supplies and power hospitals, kindergartens, ​and other key critical infrastructure, Klitschko said. About 300 tonnes of fuel a day were needed to do that.\n\nKlitschko reiterated his call for Kyiv residents to leave the city if they ‍have the opportunity to do ⁠so to ease the pressure on its infrastructure.\n\nSchools in Kyiv extended their winter holidays, and many commercial companies have switched to remote work arrangements.\n\nKlitschko said that despite all the challenges, city officials were determined to ⁠restore heating supplies in full, and they were also planning for backup scenarios in case new Russian air strikes damage the energy infrastructure.\n\n\"This ‌winter will be difficult, but we are doing everything that's possible and impossible,\" Klitschko said.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Olena Harmash; editing by Daniel Flynn and Alex Richardson)",

Meanwhile, thousands of residents were still without power in Kyiv, following an intense Russian bombardment.\n\nA young woman died overnight in a hospital intensive care unit after debris from a drone fell on a house during the attack on Saturday, Voronezh regional Gov. Alexander Gusev said on Telegram.\n\nThree other people were wounded and more than 10 apartment buildings, private houses and a high school were damaged, he said, adding that air defenses shot down 17 drones over Voronezh. The city is home to just over 1 million people and lies some 250 kilometers (155 miles) from the Ukrainian border.\n\nUkraine's General Staff said Sunday said its forces hit three drilling platforms operated by Russian oil giant Lukoil in the waters of the Caspian Sea. Ukraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion.\n\nThe attacks came after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, killing at least four people in the capital Kyiv, according to Ukrainian officials. For only the second time in the nearly four-year war, Russia used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv and NATO.\n\nUkraine’s largest private energy supplier, DTEK, said Sunday that 30,000 people in Kyiv were still without power following the attack. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Friday around half the apartment buildings — nearly 6,000 — in snowy Kyiv were left without heat in daytime temperatures of about minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 Fahrenheit).\n\nThe intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further aggression by Moscow if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday in his nightly address that Ukrainian negotiators “continue to communicate with the American side.”\n\nChief negotiator Rustem Umerov was in contact with U.S. partners on Saturday, he said.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine’s General Staff said Russia targeted Ukraine with 154 drones overnight into Sunday and 125 were shot down.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate said Sunday that Russia this month deployed the new jet-powered “Geran-5” strike drone against Ukraine for the first time. The Geran is a Russian variant of the Iranian-designed Shahed.\n\nAccording to the directorate, the drone can carry a 90-kilogram (200-pound) warhead and has a range of nearly 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",
