    "fullText": "VILNIUS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - A U.S. document on security guarantees for Ukraine is completely ready and Kyiv is waiting for a ​time and place for it to be signed, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy ‌said on Sunday, indicating that weekend talks with Russia in Abu Dhabi made some progress.\n\n\"For ‌us, security guarantees are first and foremost guarantees of security from the United States.

There were many problematic issues, but now there ⁠are fewer,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nHe said Moscow wants ​to do everything possible to get Ukraine to ​abandon eastern regions Moscow has been unable to capture since its full-scale invasion that triggered the war. But Kyiv, he said, ‍had not budged ⁠from its position that Ukraine's territorial integrity must be upheld.\n\n\"These are two fundamentally different positions – Ukraine's and Russia's. The Americans are trying to ⁠find a compromise,\" Zelenskiy said, adding that all sides must be prepared to compromise, ‌including the Americans.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Olena Janchuk spends another day of freezing isolation in her high-rise apartment.\n\nThe former kindergarten teacher has severe rheumatoid arthritis, and has been trapped for weeks on the 19th floor of her Kyiv tower block, 650 steps from the ground.\n\nLong daily blackouts caused by Russia’s bombardment of power plants and transmission lines have made working elevators a luxury.\n\nWith January temperatures plummeting to minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), there’s a permanent line of frost on the inside of Janchuk’s windows, white patterns creeping across the glass by morning.\n\nThe 53-year-old huddles over a makeshift fireplace of candles arranged beneath stacked bricks, designed to absorb and slowly release heat. USB charging cables snake across the floor from overloaded power strips, while her electric blanket is hooked up to a power bank rationed for the coldest hours.\n\n“When there’s no light and heat for seventeen and a half hours, you have to come up with something,” she said. “The bricks work best in a small room, so we stay in there.”\n\nKyiv, a city of about 3 million people, is dominated by tower blocks, many from the Soviet era, now left without power for most of the day.\n\nIn this fourth winter of war, electricity is a rationed commodity.\n\nResidents plan their lives around electricity schedules: when to cook, shower, charge phones and run washing machines. Food is chosen for shelf life, water filtered into bottles and stored in buckets. Small camping gas burners are used to heat soup or tea when the power is out.\n\nSleep is fractured by air raid sirens and the need to use electricity during off-peak hours.\n\nOutside, across snow-covered Kyiv, diesel generators rumble on commercial streets. Shoppers navigate aisles using phone flashlights, and bars glow by candlelight.\n\nApps notify users of narrowing electricity windows — usually just a few hours — enough for a household reboot.\n\nLife gets harder on the higher floors\n\nJanchuk’s 22-story building is located near a power station and residents can see the missile and drone attacks firsthand, flashes lighting up the horizon at night.\n\nDuring blackouts, they climb the stairs in darkness, phone lights bouncing off concrete steps, often accompanied by the echo of children and barking dogs. People sometimes leave plastic bags with cookies or water inside elevators for those who get stuck when the power cuts midride.\n\nJanchuk’s husband, out working most of the day, brings the groceries in the evening while her mother, 72-year-old Lyudmila Bachurina, is in charge of chores.\n\n“It’s cold, but we manage,” the mother says, holding a square USB-charged flashlight she recently mounted on the wall. “When the lights come on, I start turning on the washing machine, fill up water bottles, cook food, charge power banks, run around the kitchen and run around the house.”\n\nIn upscale neighborhoods, residents pool funds for generators to keep elevators running. But most blocks — home to pensioners, families and people with disabilities — cannot afford them.\n\nDisability advocates, including groups representing wounded war veterans, say staircases have become an invisible social barrier, cutting people off inside their own homes.\n\nThey are urging city officials to fund generators for residential buildings.\n\nUntil then, life bends around the electricity timetable. USB lamps, power banks and inverter batteries have become household staples. Telegram chats help neighbors check on the elderly and swap blackout updates.\n\nFrom upper floors, Kyivans look out over a skyline of high rises and the city’s historic golden-domed churches. At night, flashes of explosions are visible as Russia continues its campaign against Ukraine’s energy system.\n\nRussia has inflicted vast damage on Ukraine’s infrastructure\n\nToo many power stations and transmission lines have been hit to meet demand, even with electricity imports from Europe. To prevent a grid collapse, operators impose rolling blackouts, keeping hospitals and critical services alive while homes go dark.\n\nAt one coal-fired power plant struck repeatedly, shift supervisor Yuriy walks through wreckage of charred machinery, collapsed roofs and control panels melted into useless lumps. Repairs are carried out by torchlight, giant sandbags shielding what still works. Photographs of colleagues killed on the job hang near the entrance.\n\n“After missile and drone attacks, the consequences are terrible — large-scale,” he said.\n\nOfficials asked that the plant’s location and Yuriy’s full name not be disclosed for security reasons.\n\n“Our energy equipment has been destroyed. It is expensive,” Yuriy said. “Right now, we’re restoring what we can.”\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nKyiv has repeatedly updated its austere winter power-saving schedule, dimming or cutting streetlights in low-traffic areas and investing in less centralized power generation.\n\nIn the tower blocks, restoration feels far off.\n\n“I’m tired, really tired, to be honest. When you can’t go outside, when you don’t see the sun, when there’s no light and you can’t even go to the store on your own. … It wears you down,” Bachurina said.\n\n“But the important thing, as all Ukrainians say now, is that we will endure anything until the war ends.”\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - Russia launched another vast attack on Ukraine's energy system in the small hours of Saturday, rocking Kyiv with explosions throughout the night and leaving ​1.2 million properties without power countrywide.\n\nNearly 6,000 buildings in the capital were left without heating ‌on Saturday morning as temperatures hovered around -10 degrees Celsius (14 F). Many residents' apartments were already freezing cold from disruption to the ‌city's centralised heat distribution system following previous attacks.\n\nMoscow carried out the strikes as trilateral, U.S.-brokered talks between Russia and Ukraine continued into a second day in the UAE, with no sign of compromise on Friday.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said one person was killed in the capital city and four injured, including three being treated ⁠in hospital, while 19 people including ‌a child were wounded in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv.\n\nRussia, which has pummelled Ukraine's power grid since its full-scale invasion in 2022, is conducting its heaviest bombardment campaign ‍on energy facilities this winter, leaving people across Ukraine with only a few hours of power a day and some without heat or water.\n\nOver 800,000 people in the capital and another 400,000 in the northern region of Chernihiv ​were without power after the latest attacks, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said.\n\nUkraine's air force said ‌Russia had unleashed 375 drones and 21 missiles, including two of its rarely deployed Tsirkon ballistic missiles, in its overnight attack.\n\nThe sky over Kyiv was lit up by regular orange flashes as air defences fired on missiles and drones descending on the capital, with loud booms echoing around the city's tall buildings.\n\nTymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, reported strikes in at least four districts. A medical facility was ⁠among the buildings damaged.\n\nBefore Saturday, Kyiv had already endured two ​mass overnight attacks since the New Year that have knocked ​out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings.\n\nEmergency workers were still engaged in restoring services to residents that had been knocked out by those attacks, and Klitschko said ‍many of the buildings ⁠that had lost heating on Saturday had only recently had it restored.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a frequent target 30 km (18 miles) from the Russian border and much closer to eastern battlefronts, Mayor Ihor ⁠Terekhov said 25 drones had hit several districts.\n\nWriting on Telegram, Terekhov said the drones had struck a dormitory for displaced people ‌and two medical facilities including a maternity hospital.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces fired nearly $100 million worth of air defense missiles battling Russia's latest bombardment, Kyiv revealed on Tuesday, offering insight into the war's growing financial toll.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that the Russian attack, which began Monday night and continued into Tuesday, forced Kyiv to launch around €80 million (roughly $94 million) worth of interceptor missiles.\n\n\"Imagine that — the cost of these missiles,\" Zelenskyy said over WhatsApp in response to a question about interceptor stockpiles.\n\nThe staggering figure covers only the interceptor missiles and does not appear to account for any other munitions expended to defend against the Russian attack, which also included hundreds of drones.\n\nRussia launched 18 ballistic missiles, 15 cruise missiles, and one anti-ship missile overnight, according to data from Ukraine's air force. It said in a statement that 27 were shot down, while five hit their targets.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia has \"significantly increased\" its use of ballistic missiles and has been able to obtain critical technology for the munitions from third-party countries and from industry.\n\n\"Nevertheless, their ability to produce these missiles must be reduced — and that is not happening yet,\" he said in response to another question.\n\nAlthough Ukraine has received some additional air defense systems from Western countries, Zelenskyy said more are still needed, along with additional interceptor missiles to keep pace with Russia's attacks.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged that it has been difficult for Ukraine to obtain the necessary interceptor missiles. He specifically singled out the PAC-3, which has a $3.7 million price tag and is fired from US-made Patriot batteries, as the best chance Kyiv has to defeat Russian ballistic missiles.\n\n\"War is an extremely expensive Russian luxury, and for us it results in severe losses,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussian missiles are not the only worry for Ukraine. Moscow's overnight attack involved 339 drones. Kyiv said its Air Force shot down 315 of them. Two dozen hit their targets.\n\nTo preserve its costly air defense missiles, Ukraine has been increasingly relying on locally made interceptor drones that cost as little as a few thousand dollars to hunt down and destroy Russian drones.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine is producing around 1,000 interceptor drones each day, a goal he set last summer. The challenge now, he said, is that the number of drones has outpaced the number of operators who can control them.\n\n\"Therefore, now we must catch up in terms of the number of interceptor groups — the corresponding mobile groups,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he has tasked senior Ukrainian military leadership with bridging the gap.",

Therefore, if the level of security guarantees is lower than expected, approval of such a proposal will be even lower,\" said KIIS executive director Anton Hrushetskyi.\n\nThe survey was conducted in early January among 601 respondents on Ukrainian-controlled territory.\n\nAlmost 70% did not believe current negotiations would lead to a lasting peace.\n\nSome 57% believed ⁠Russia would attack again in the event ​of a ceasefire at the current frontlines and security ​guarantees from allies.\n\nHowever, even if security guarantees were given, 40% believed the U.S. would not provide support in the event of renewed Russian ‍invasion, while 39% ⁠thought it would.\n\nRussia has publicly shown little interest in scaling down its demands and made few comments regarding the 20-point peace framework that Ukraine and the ⁠U.S. have been trying to finalise.\n\nInstead, Russia has stepped up air strikes, significantly damaging already shattered ‌energy infrastructure and leaving millions without power and heating in freezing temperatures.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Yuliia Dysa; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves ​of Russian attacks on its infrastructure, mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters on Friday.\n\nKyiv, one of Eastern ‌Europe's largest cities, requires 1,700 megawatts of electricity to power the services for its 3.6 million people, Klitschko said.\n\nKlitschko said the current energy crisis ‌was the most difficult challenge facing the capital in the nearly four years since Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\n\"It's the first time in the history of our city that, in such severe frosts, most of the city was left without heating and with a huge shortage of electricity,\" Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, said in an interview ⁠in his office at the heart of ‌Kyiv.\n\nSome Kyiv residents face up to 18 to 20 hours a day without mains electricity. Ukraine declared an energy emergency this week as its grid crumbles due to accumulated wartime ‍damage and a new targeted wave of Russian bombardments.\n\nBitter cold weather with icy rain and snow exacerbated the challenges. Nighttime minimum temperatures have dipped to around -17 Celsius (1 Fahrenheit) in Kyiv this week.\n\nFAST REPAIRS, GENERATORS AND INTERNATIONAL AID\n\nKlitschko said Ukraine's international partners had ​rushed in additional generators, and repair teams had worked round the clock to restore heating following a Russian ‌strike last week that knocked out supplies to 6,000 apartment buildings.\n\nAbout 100 buildings still have no heating, he said.\n\n\"We're not just working during the day now, we're working at night too,\" he said. \"There is no such thing as the start and end of the working day for us.\"\n\nIn addition to repairs and generators, the city opened about 1,300 sites with heaters to help residents keep warm, and was working to install mini thermal power stations in ⁠some districts to decentralize electricity and heating.\n\nWith generators, the priority was ​to provide electricity to ensure water supplies and power hospitals, kindergartens, ​and other key critical infrastructure, Klitschko said. About 300 tonnes of fuel a day were needed to do that.\n\nKlitschko reiterated his call for Kyiv residents to leave the city if they ‍have the opportunity to do ⁠so to ease the pressure on its infrastructure.\n\nSchools in Kyiv extended their winter holidays, and many commercial companies have switched to remote work arrangements.\n\nKlitschko said that despite all the challenges, city officials were determined to ⁠restore heating supplies in full, and they were also planning for backup scenarios in case new Russian air strikes damage the energy infrastructure.\n\n\"This ‌winter will be difficult, but we are doing everything that's possible and impossible,\" Klitschko said.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Olena Harmash; editing by Daniel Flynn and Alex Richardson)",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian drone strike killed one person and wounded three others in the Russian city of Voronezh, local officials said Sunday. Meanwhile, thousands of residents were still without power in Kyiv, following an intense Russian bombardment.\n\nA young woman died overnight in a hospital intensive care unit after debris from a drone fell on a house during the attack on Saturday, Voronezh regional Gov. Alexander Gusev said on Telegram.\n\nThree other people were wounded and more than 10 apartment buildings, private houses and a high school were damaged, he said, adding that air defenses shot down 17 drones over Voronezh. The city is home to just over 1 million people and lies some 250 kilometers (155 miles) from the Ukrainian border.\n\nUkraine's General Staff said Sunday said its forces hit three drilling platforms operated by Russian oil giant Lukoil in the waters of the Caspian Sea. Ukraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion.\n\nThe attacks came after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, killing at least four people in the capital Kyiv, according to Ukrainian officials. For only the second time in the nearly four-year war, Russia used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv and NATO.\n\nUkraine’s largest private energy supplier, DTEK, said Sunday that 30,000 people in Kyiv were still without power following the attack. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Friday around half the apartment buildings — nearly 6,000 — in snowy Kyiv were left without heat in daytime temperatures of about minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 Fahrenheit).\n\nThe intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further aggression by Moscow if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday in his nightly address that Ukrainian negotiators “continue to communicate with the American side.”\n\nChief negotiator Rustem Umerov was in contact with U.S. partners on Saturday, he said.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine’s General Staff said Russia targeted Ukraine with 154 drones overnight into Sunday and 125 were shot down.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate said Sunday that Russia this month deployed the new jet-powered “Geran-5” strike drone against Ukraine for the first time. The Geran is a Russian variant of the Iranian-designed Shahed.\n\nAccording to the directorate, the drone can carry a 90-kilogram (200-pound) warhead and has a range of nearly 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",
