    "fullText": "Luis Enrique rarely lets slip any admission of his team's weaknesses.\n\nThe Spaniard described Paris St-Germain's defeat at Sporting in the Champions League last week as their best away performance since he took over as manager in 2023.\n\nThat is a bold claim, given the European champions have won in Barcelona and scored seven in Leverkusen this season alone.\n\nBut the statistics do not necessarily contradict his assessment, even if the PSG boss may have been looking to shield his players from increased criticism.\n\nPSG appeared to have a firm grip on the match, with three-quarters of the possession, 28 shots, and three disallowed goals, but were undone by a late double from Sporting's Colombia striker Luis Suarez.\n\n\"We deserved to win, but that's how it is in football,\" said Luis Enrique.\n\nDespite controlling the game, issues which plagued the start of the Parisians' Champions League campaign last season - as they went winless in four fixtures - seem to have resurfaced.\n\nJust like in the autumn of 2024, their otherwise authoritative displays have been undermined by defensive mistakes and poor finishing.\n\nLast year, the spectacular turnaround in form which culminated in a treble was helped by some clinical finishing, especially in away matches where chances were few and far between.\n\nAt the same time, low blocks were taken apart by a fluid front three led by Ousmane Dembele in an all-action false-nine role.\n\nHowever, the free-flowing attacks from last season have been replaced by long passages of stale possession this term - as the league defeats by Marseille and Monaco illustrated.\n\nThose results could be explained by the injury crisis which meant Dembele, Desire Doue, Nuno Mendes and Achraf Hakimi were all sidelined in the autumn.\n\nThe Coupe de France loss to Paris FC earlier this month, though, seemed to confirm something is not clicking for PSG.\n\nA convincing win over Lille a few days later, in which Dembele scored an improbable lob from the edge of the box, only briefly hinted at a return to their best.\n\nPSG were then wasteful in defeat in Portugal and again in the 1-0 win at Auxerre last Friday.\n\n\"We created a lot of chances, but we're lacking a bit of confidence and accuracy to finish them,\" Luis Enrique said after the latter victory which meant his side moved above Lens to the top of Ligue 1.\n\nPSG are also currently in the top eight of the Champions League's league phase, but have so far not matched the impressive standards set last season.",

    "fullText": "Paris Saint-Germain have finalised the signing of Pedro ‘Dro’ Fernandez from Barcelona, and fresh details from MARCA reveal that the deal happened by complete diplomacy rather than by aggressive negotiation.\n\nIt is said that rather than a sudden raid, the transfer was constructed with utmost respect.\n\nOne of the most important elements in the operation was the strong institutional relationship between Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nPSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi was determined not to enter into any form of conflict with Joan Laporta.\n\nFor that reason, PSG did not move until the situation was completely clear. Only once Dro personally informed Barcelona of his intention to leave did PSG activate their approach.\n\nUntil that moment, there was no pressure from Paris. Barcelona were already dealing with the disappointment of losing a highly rated midfielder, and PSG were careful not to worsen the situation.\n\nOnce the player’s position became official, the focus shifted from retaining him to finding the most suitable destination.\n\nPedro Fernandez has joined PSG. (Photo by Judit Cartiel/Getty Images)\n\nAt that point, PSG were perfectly positioned to negotiate calmly and directly with Barça.\n\nManchester City and Borussia Dortmund both showed strong interest in Dro. However, it was PSG who managed to align every piece of the puzzle.\n\nThe combination of a clear sporting plan, respectful dialogue with Barcelona, and the player’s preferences ultimately tipped the balance in Paris’ favour.\n\nFrom PSG’s perspective, the deal has certainly been more than the reported €8.5 million fee.\n\nThis is because PSG manager Luis Enrique and sporting advisor Luis Campos see Dro as a natural fit for the club’s new identity.\n\nWhat tipped the scales in PSG’s favour was the player’s preference, the club’s strong sporting project and their ideal relationship with Barcelona",

    "fullText": "Paris Saint-Germain have completed the signing of Barcelona teenager Dro Fernandez.\n\nThe Parisians have secured one of La Masia’s most highly rated prospects after agreeing a fee in excess of his €6 million (£5.2m) release clause.\n\nFernandez, who turned 18 earlier this month, arrived in the French capital on Sunday night, ending a turbulent few weeks that have left Barcelona frustrated and disappointed.\n\nWhile his buyout clause stood at €6m, PSG reportedly paid more than €8m (£6.9m) as a gesture of goodwill to a deal that nonetheless angered senior figures at the Catalan club.\n\nConsidered one of the standout midfielders of his age group in Spain, Fernandez joined Barcelona’s academy at 14 and quickly rose through the ranks.\n\nHis technical quality and press resistance earned comparisons to Thiago Alcântara and Pedri, and he was viewed internally as a long-term first-team option.\n\nHead coach Hansi Flick had placed clear faith in the midfielder, taking him on Barcelona’s pre-season tour of Asia last summer, where Fernandez scored against Daegu FC.\n\nHe later made his senior debuts in both La Liga and the Champions League, appearing 5 times and totalling 148 minutes.\n\nDespite those signs of trust, Fernandez informed Flick in January of his desire to leave in search of more regular football.\n\nThe decision reportedly came just days after his representatives had appeared to agree a new contract with Barcelona, due to be signed following his 18th birthday.\n\nFlick did little to hide his frustration when asked about the situation earlier this month, pointing to the influence of agents and advisers around young players.\n\nClub president Joan Laporta later described the move as unpleasant, admitting Barcelona felt blindsided by the timing of the decision.\n\nAt PSG, Fernandez will reunite with Luis Enrique, whose 4-3-3 system could be a more natural fit for his profile.\n\nThe French champions hope the move will accelerate the development of a midfielder many in Spain believe is destined for the very top.",

    "description": "Vivienne Zhao, 33, moved to Paris in her 20s. Living in France, far away from her parents, has shifted her understanding of home.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Vivienne Zhao, 33, a French teacher. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFor years, I treated belonging as a measure of my worth. I believed that if I spoke well enough, adapted carefully enough, and paid close enough attention to other people's expectations, I would eventually earn my place.\n\nLiving abroad in France taught me otherwise. Not suddenly, and not dramatically, but slowly, through repetition.\n\nI learned that language, effort, and proximity all have limits. That you can do everything \"right\" and still remain slightly outside. And that this distance isn't necessarily a failure, it's often just the reality of living between cultures.\n\nI was born in China and spent my childhood moving between three Chinese cities.\n\nAfter graduating with a journalism degree from a university in central China, I moved alone to Paris in 2015. Inspired by a love of cooking and shows like \"Top Chef,\" I decided to study French cuisine. My father supported the leap, while my mother initially pushed for a more conventional path. Eventually, she came around. At 22, I enrolled at Le Cordon Bleu.\n\nI arrived in Paris with a backpack, a suitcase, and nine months of French study behind me. I believed preparation would carry me through.\n\nVery quickly, that belief was tested. Paris didn't match the France I imagined. It wasn't the welcoming countryside town I'd spent two weeks in for a school exchange when I was 14.\n\nFor someone reserved, like me, forming friendships with locals was harder than I'd imagined.\n\nThere was no single moment when I realized I might never fully \"belong.\" It became clear gradually. During my first two years, I lived in a house with Chinese students. I attended language exchanges, hoping to connect with French people and feel closer to local life. Conversations were pleasant, but fleeting.\n\nEnglish — which I'd been taught in school — became essential. My closest friendships were with other international students.\n\nI started dating a French man, hoping proximity would help. At one of his friend's weddings, I noticed that conversations faded the moment he stepped away — not from exclusion, but uncertainty. We didn't share the same humor, references, or history.\n\nThat experience changed how I saw belonging. It couldn't be earned through effort or language alone. Accepting that freed me from seeing it as a personal failure.\n\nI decided that if I couldn't belong socially, I could at least be reliable. That mindset shaped how I approached work, especially during the five years I spent in French restaurants. I didn't seek attention or closeness. What mattered was competence — meeting expectations and delivering what the chef required.\n\nIn one restaurant, I would arrive hours early to prep and often worked through breaks to keep service running. One night, overwhelmed and out of prepared fish, the chef turned to me. Under pressure, I filleted an entire tuna for service. She was impressed by my speed and precision, and from then on trusted me with full preparations when she was delayed.\n\nI made mistakes, but over time, professional trust became my anchor. Earned quietly through consistency, it offered a form of belonging that didn't rely on intimacy or personality.\n\nThere were subtler distances, too. French humor often relies on teasing and irony, and disagreement signals engagement. Coming from a background that values harmony, I sometimes felt emotionally out of sync, even when socially accepted.\n\nI eventually left the restaurant industry due to its physical intensity. I focused fully on language study, earned a graduate degree in teaching French as a foreign language, and became a French teacher.\n\nFor a long time, I measured my worth through social reactions and assumed distance meant failure. Over time — through age, reflection, journaling, and publishing essays — that mindset softened.\n\nMy understanding of home shifted, too. My mother believes belonging is rooted in permanence, in returning to where you come from. Yet each time I go back to China, I feel an unexpected sense of distance. It shows up in small ways, in the habits I've picked up abroad.\n\nI greet bus drivers or shop staff, often to visible surprise. It's a reminder that I no longer move in the same social rhythm.\n\nNow, after building my own family, sharing daily routines, and caring for our cat, I feel I have a home. Its location matters less than the stability and emotional safety it provides. This hasn't weakened my bond with my parents; if anything, it's made it healthier and more grounded.\n\nHaving lived long-term in two countries, I carry both. China shaped my instincts — how I think, relate, and find comfort — while France shaped my self-worth and independence.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad?

    "description": "Hilton was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and although she struggled to cope with some of the symptoms as a teen, she now calls it her \"superpower.\"",
    "fullText": "Paris Hilton shared the secret sauce behind her entrepreneurial success: her ADHD.\n\nThe 44-year-old original influencer, reality star, and founder of a laundry list of business ventures, said on the January 21 episode of \"On Purpose with Jay Shetty\" that her neurodivergent brain helps her \"think outside the box.\"\n\n\"I never wanted to be in one lane. I wanted to create my own lane. And I just have always been someone who just loves to do things and take risks and do things before anyone else,\" she said.\n\nHilton was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and although she struggled to cope with some of the symptoms as a teen, she now calls it her \"superpower.\"\n\n\"I know I would not be the woman I am today or the entrepreneur without it, because it just gives me such drive and curiosity and creativity and having a million ideas all the time, and just my brain just never stops,\" Hilton added.\n\nShe said that she is able to \"hyperfocus\" and enter a flow state when something interests her. \"That's where the magic happens,\" she said.\n\nPeople with ADHD, which stands for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, can have trouble concentrating or sitting still, because their brains work differently to most people. Signs and symptoms can include having high levels of energy, being impulsive, finding it hard to follow instructions or finish tasks, and being very talkative.\n\nBefore Hilton was diagnosed with ADHD, she often worried something was \"wrong\" with her, and didn't understand why she struggled at school.\n\n\"No matter how hard I would study or try, I would constantly just not be able to remember things in school, be losing my homework, failing tests,\" she said.\n\nShe also experienced severe emotional pain when she felt rejected or criticized, a condition known as rejection-sensitive dysphoria, which is linked to ADHD.\n\n\"It's exhausting. And it's painful, and it's very difficult to go through,\" she said.\n\nNow, she is spreading the message across her music, documentaries, and media interviews that ADHD can be \"a good thing,\" she added.\n\n\"You can be successful in life, and some of the most creative people I know and brilliant geniuses all have ADHD as well,\" Hilton said.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona will be busy in the final week of the winter transfer window, both in terms of signings and exits. Regarding the latter, the most notable will be Dro Fernandez, who is poised to join Paris Saint-Germain in the coming days.\n\nEarlier this month, Dro handed in a transfer request, which was met with a lot of surprise – and anger – within Barcelona. PSG are close to agreeing a deal to sign the 18-year-old midfielder, who was promoted to the first team last summer after impressing Hansi Flick during pre-season.\n\nThe club’s general feeling towards the Dro situation was made clear by president Joan Laporta, who was asked for his reaction when speaking on Catalunya Radio on Sunday, as per MD.\n\n“We will talk about it when it is fully done. He has announced that he will not continue. It is an unpleasant situation. We will be able to redirect the situation as it had been proposed. It has been a surprise. We had agreed on another solution for Dro by the time he turned 18 and surprisingly his agent told us that we couldn’t deliver on what we had agreed upon. We will try to make it end as well as possible in the interest of Barça.”\n\nBarcelona had high hopes for Dro, as Laporta has now made clear. He would have been a player for the first team for many years to come, where he would have been competing alongside the likes of Fermin Lopez and Dani Olmo, as well as fellow La Masia star Guille Fernandez.\n\nBut even more than this, the real kicker for Barcelona is losing Dro for such a small amount. A deal is expected to be finalised for around €8m, which is far below their valuation of the teenage talent.",

Black trousers and leather loafers would have elevated the look.\n\nThe \"Frankenstein\" actor's Dior ensemble included a floor-length blue skirt and a black fringe jacket cinched at the waist.\n\nThe top half matched her dark hair and leather purse, while her skirt added a subtle pop of color.\n\nThe musician attended Dior's show in wide-legged gray trousers and a fitted blue blazer worn as a blouse. She also wore black leather heels, colorful necklaces, and a white bag covered in heavy fringe.\n\nHer outfit might have been more effective if she'd stuck to one or two colors and chosen one statement accessory instead of mixing many.\n\nThe \"Hamnet\" actor sported black trousers and a blue, striped button-up beneath a gray peacoat. He accessorized with a Dior monogram belt and statement leather shoes.\n\nThe outfit was chic, simple, and the epitome of Dior's menswear designs.\n\nThe musician was photographed at the Dries Van Noten runway show wearing a mix of neutral staples.\n\nHe wore baggy brown pants, a cream-colored coat, a tan turtleneck top, and a thick brown scarf. Then there were his accessories. Harlow wore black boots, silver glasses, and a Kangol hat.\n\nThere was a lot going on with his outfit, but no piece was particularly memorable.\n\nHe attended the Louis Vuitton show wearing a black suit from the fashion house. Rather than opting for a classic, straight style, the \"Stranger Things\" star went with something more modern.\n\nThe suit featured a loose-fitting blazer over a blue-and-white striped button-up shirt. The latter was tucked into barrel-leg trousers, which gave his look a unique shape.",

    "description": "As a seasoned travel planner, I have suggestions for the best European destinations to visit, from Italy's Cinque Terre to France's Strasbourg.",
    "fullText": "As a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels, I've explored Europe extensively to find the best recommendations for my clients.\n\nThough popular cities such as Paris, London, Rome, and Amsterdam have massive appeal, the continent's vast landscape offers gems around every corner.\n\nHere are five European destinations I think everyone should visit at least once.\n\nSalzburg is a stunning destination — especially if you're a \"Sound of Music\" fan.\n\nThere are plenty of prearranged tours to iconic filming locations where you can dance around the Pegasus fountain like Maria and the children, visit the \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" gazebo, and tour the stunning Basilika St. Michael, where Maria was married to Captain Von Trapp.\n\nIn the summer and fall, there are even \"Sound of Music\" bike tours available.\n\nAnd yes, there are plenty of other activities in the city, even if you're not into musicals. Young children may like the Salzburg Zoo, and music lovers can explore Mozart's birthplace and residence.\n\nSitting atop a hill, Hohensalzburg Fortress is one of the largest castles in the area and boasts great views of the city. To get another stunning view, take the Untersberg cable car.\n\nJust a few hours from London by train, Liverpool is a must-visit spot for Beatles fans.\n\nAll four band members grew up in the port city. There are many different types of excursions, from short bus rides to full-day private tours that will immerse you in the sights and sounds of the band's legacy.\n\nIn Liverpool, football (or American soccer) is a way of life, and there are two main clubs here: Liverpool and Everton. Fans of the game can take an LFC stadium tour for a behind-the-scenes look.\n\nThe city also houses a slew of theaters, art galleries, and museums — and it's becoming a hot destination for shopping and unique culinary experiences.\n\nCinque Terre is one of my favorite cities — or, more accurately, my favorite collection of five villages.\n\nNestled along the Italian Riviera, Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore are accessible only by train, ferry, or foot.\n\nEach has a distinct style, and hikers flock to this region to enjoy the beautiful scenery.\n\nVernazza, my favorite village, is the gem of this region. I love wandering the cobbled streets to shop, snack, and explore. You can also visit the Castello Doria or the church of Santa Margherita d'Antiochia.\n\nIn the summer months, tourists sunbathe on the beaches of Monterosso or take a dip in the sea. For a history lesson, visit the remains of Castello Fieschi or the Church of St John the Baptist and the Capuchin Monastery.\n\nIn Manarola, take some time to watch locals cliff-jump into the marina. I also suggest taking a wine tour through the town to sample some local specialties. Be sure to try Sciacchetrà, a sweet but strong dessert wine produced in Cinque Terre.\n\nRiomaggiore is also home to a castle and churches dating back to the 13th and 14th centuries. The center of the town is great for wandering, shopping, and eating.\n\nCorniglia is probably the quietest of the five villages. There, climb the Lardarina staircase for beautiful views of the coastline or take a boat tour to fully enjoy the area's beauty.\n\nJust about two hours east of Paris by high-speed train, Strasbourg is a beautiful city along the border of France and Germany.\n\nEvery trip should include a visit to the Gothic Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-Strasbourg. Try to plan your day around arriving there at 12:30 p.m. to see the wooden figures dance around the clock.\n\nAfter your cathedral visit, stroll through Petite France, explore cheese shops, and take a break to sip a glass of wine at one of the canal's many cafés.\n\nAt the end of the year, Strasbourg is also home to one of the oldest Christmas markets, dating back to the late 1500s. The Christkindelsmärik is truly magical, with more than 300 vendors selling their holiday best.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 3, 2024, and most recently updated on January 23, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Steve Borthwick has given England the challenge of leading their fans to a final-round assault on Paris as they chase Six Nations glory for the first time in seven years.\n\nAfter 11 straight wins, England come into the tournament in excellent form and buoyant mood as they begin their campaign at home to Wales on 7 February.\n\nHowever, Borthwick - part of the squad when England fans flocked to Paris to see their side in the 2007 Rugby World Cup final against South Africa - is daring to dream before the 14 March meeting with defending champions and title favourites France.\n\n\"People can see the potential that's in this group,\" he told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"They can see the direction this team is going on, the way it is tracking.\n\n\"Two weeks ago we met as a team and I spoke to them about how the last seven Six Nations Championships have been decided on the last round of fixtures.\n\n\"I think it's 17 of the last 20.\n\n\"On 14 March we're playing against a brilliant France team in Paris.\n\n\"We want to be in a position in that game to get what we all want to achieve. We want English fans flooding across the channel to get there and watch that game.\n\n\"The only way you get to that point is taking care of every step along the journey.\"\n\nBorthwick predicts a barrage of a box-kicks will be the first obstacle in his side's way with Wales - in new coach Steve Tandy's first Six Nations campaign in charge - taking to the Twickenham skies.\n\n\"He's brought a defensive system from Scotland where they've two men tackling high, trying to hold people up in the air,\" added Borthwick said of his opposite number.\n\n\"You can see they know they've got the pace on the edges, so they're going to come in and try to move the ball to the edges.\n\n\"The biggest thing, the thing that's core to their game is that contestable kick game. I reckon they're probably going to kick maybe 50 contestable kicks here at Allianz Stadium in a couple of weeks' time.\n\n\"We're going to be prepared for that.\"",

    "fullText": "Atletico Madrid will be busy between now and the closing of the winter transfer window, as they seek reinforcements for Diego Simeone’s squad. The departures of Javi Galan, Conor Gallagher and Giacomo Raspadori mean that a new left, central midfielder and forward are needed, and currently, work is being done on each area.\n\nMidfield is the priority for the time being, but addressing defence and attack is equally important. For the latter, targets have already been identified, with the favourite having also been picked out.\n\nAs per Diario AS, Atleti are very keen on signing Lee Kang-in, and talks between the two clubs are already ongoing. Director of Football Mateu Alemany has been in Paris in recent days, and he took in Paris Saint-Germain’s 3-0 victory over Lille on Friday, a match that the South Korea international was not involved in.\n\nLee is currently sidelined with a minor injury, but he will be back in action before the end of the month. Atleti do not see his current absence as a stumbling block, which is they have made their move, and with good relations between themselves and PSG, it is hoped that an agreement can be reached in the coming days.\n\nPSG are counting on Lee, so it is far from certain that PSG will allow a deal to be done. If that is the case, Atleti are prepared to move for another Ligue 1 attack: Matias Fernandez-Pardo. As per Diario AS, Los Colchoneros have rekindled the interest they showed in the summer, with the feeling now being that a deal is much more achievable.\n\nIt will be interesting to see who Atleti end up with, but both players would be exciting additions to Simeone’s squad – certainly more so than Raspadori was in the summer.",

    "fullText": "Jannik Sinner will return to competitive tennis at the Australian Open, where he is looking for his third consecutive crown in Melbourne.\n\nThe Italian ended the 2025 season in stunning fashion, by lifting the Vienna Open, the Paris Masters, and the ATP Finals back-to-back.\n\nSinner looked unbeatable on indoor hardcourts and he will be hoping to transfer that form onto the outdoor hardcourt of the Australian Open.\n\nAhead of his return to the first Grand Slam of the year, Sinner has revealed one of his goals for the season.\n\nDespite collecting two Grand Slams, as well as four ATP titles, Sinner still ended the season behind Carlos Alcaraz in the rankings.\n\nSinner lost his world number one status when he was defeated by his Spanish rival in the final of the US Open.\n\nIn 2026, Sinner is desperate to once again reach the summit of the ATP Tour rankings.\n\nSpeaking to 9 News Australia, Sinner said: “That’s one of the goals of the season. It’s gonna be very difficult to get back there, but I’m happy to put myself in the game again.”\n\nOne of the main reasons Sinner ended the season as the world number two, was because of his three-month ban at the start of the year.\n\nSinner was forced to miss several high-profile hard court tournaments after winning the 2025 Australian Open, which dented his ranking.\n\nWith no points to defend for three months, it is very likely that Sinner will dislodge Alcaraz at the top of the rankings.\n\nSinner has been drawn against Hugo Gaston in the first round of the Australian Open as he looks to continue his 12-match unbeaten streak in Melbourne.\n\nThe two men have only played each other twice on the ATP Tour, and both of those matches came back in 2021.\n\nThe world number two won both against his French counterpart, dropping just nine games in the two matches.\n\nSinner has been drawn in the same section of the draw as Joao Fonseca, Karen Khachanov, and Sebastian Baez.",

    "fullText": "For matchday 18 of Ligue 1, Paris Saint-Germain defeated Lille 3-0 on Friday evening at the Parc des Princes.\n\nIt was a home victory under the rain for the first match of the second half of the league season. After a scare early in the match when Olivier Giroud hit the crossbar (0-0, 2′), PSG controlled the game and won easily.\n\nOusmane Dembélé and Bradley Barcola are the Parisian goalscorers. Dembélé scored twice, his second brace of the season after the first in Toulouse (3-6, 30 August 2025).\n\nFollowing a magnificent pass from Vitinha, the Ballon d’Or winner opened the scoring with a wonderful left-footed strike from just outside the box, his shot hitting the post and beating Berke Özer for PSG’s first shot on target (1-0, 13′).\n\nDembélé has scored in each of his last four starts for PSG in official competition. PSG’s second goal was a thing of beauty! Désiré Doué found Dembélé with a one-touch pass from 65 feet out in the box. The Parisian number 10 cut inside and feinted a shot. He held off three defenders before lobbing Özer (2-0, 64′).\n\nDembélé scored his fifth goal of the Ligue 1 season under the watchful eye of Pauleta, who was also accustomed to scoring these kinds of incredible goals. The entire Parc des Princes applauded the Ballon d’Or winner when he was replaced by Gonçalo Ramos (2-0, 75′).\n\nIn the additional time, PSG scored their third goal thanks to Barcola, who came on in the 63rd minute. Marius Broholm sent a risky pass to Aïssa Mandi on his left, Barcola intercepted the ball in front of the Algerian and easily scored with his left foot (3–0, 90’+3).\n\nWith their elimination from the Coupe de France four days earlier in the Paris derby against Paris FC now forgotten, the European champions are putting pressure back on Lens. With this 13th victory in 18 matches, PSG reclaimed first place in Ligue 1 from Lens, which hosts Auxerre on Saturday.\n\nThe Parisians are two points ahead of Lens and have regained their confidence ahead of next Tuesday’s UEFA Champions League match against Sporting. The objective is very clear: Secure a place in the top eight in Portugal and go straight through to the round of 16.",

    "description": "The stars of \"Bridgerton\" season four wore daring sets, statement ball gowns, and chic suits at the world premiere in Paris on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "It's almost time to return to the ton, gentle reader.\n\nThe first episodes of season four of \"Bridgerton\" will drop on Netflix on January 29, with part two premiering on February 26. The season focuses on Benedict Bridgerton's love story with Sophie Baek. Luke Thompson will reprise his role as Benedict, while Yerin Ha will play Sophie.\n\nAhead of the show's Netflix release, the cast of \"Bridgerton\" gathered at the Palais Brongniart in Paris on Wednesday to celebrate the season's world premiere in red-carpet style.\n\nSome stars wore high-fashion outfits that nodded to their characters, while others missed the mark with lackluster suits or dresses that didn't fit the event.\n\nTake a look at some of the best and worst outfits from the \"Bridgerton\" season four premiere.\n\nHa, who stars as Sophie Baek in season four of \"Bridgerton,\" arrived at the premiere in an ice-blue gown designed by Prada.\n\nThe dress had a bedazzled halter neckline that matched the beading on a cutout on the bodice. The floor-length skirt featured two large pleats that cascaded into a train that trailed behind Ha as she walked the red carpet. Sparkly jewelry completed Ha's glamorous look.\n\nThe ensemble looked like a modern take on Cinderella's iconic blue dress. It was fitting since Julia Quinn's \"An Offer from a Gentleman,\" upon which season four is based, is a retelling of \"Cinderella.\"\n\nAs he stepped into the leading role of \"Bridgerton,\" Thompson wore an all-black ensemble. He paired a black suit with a black button-down shirt, a black tie, and a black flower on his lapel. The only color on the look was a sparkly tie clip.\n\nThe look was stylish, but the black pieces blended so well that it became difficult to distinguish the different elements, particularly the flower and pin.\n\nSome pops of color may have made the outfit stand out more.\n\nJessie, who plays Eloise Bridgerton, chose an oversize suit for the event.\n\nThe double-breasted jacket and pants were black, but they were adorned with an assortment of flowers in various colors to give the suit some pop. Jessie paired the suit with a slicked-back hairstyle and several earrings and rings, adding a high-fashion edge.\n\nRosheuvel, who plays Queen Charlotte, wore a floor-length sweater dress from Sonney for the premiere. The burnt orange look had a slight sparkle and a cowl neckline, and Rosheuvel wore a matching coat and color-coordinated earrings.\n\nThe outfit was stylish, but it didn't feel formal enough for the red-carpet event. It may have worked better for a daytime press event, or Rosheuvel could have chosen a dress with the same silhouette in a different fabric.\n\nAlli, who plays Lord John Stirling on \"Bridgerton,\" wore an oversize black suit to the event.\n\nHe paired the suit with a white shirt, which he wore without a tie, and it peeked out from the cuffs of his jacket. He added a small silver brooch to his lapel for a chic addition.\n\nThe modern take on a tuxedo exuded high fashion.\n\nDodd, who married John Stirling as Francesca Bridgerton in season three of \"Bridgerton,\" chose a black Giambattista Valli Paris set for the premiere.\n\nThe top was a black, cropped shrug with a V-neck and a button closure that revealed her midriff. It was paired with a low-waisted, calf-length skirt that poofed out around her, giving it a ball-gown feel despite the modern silhouette.\n\nBlack heels and silver jewelry tied Dodd's stylish look together.\n\nThe Lady Danbury actor's custom Torlowei gown for the premiere was beautiful, with a high neckline and black lace detailing.\n\nHowever, Andoh's open-toed black shoes didn't quite match the dress, as they seemed less formal than the gown. Different shoes and statement earrings could have better accented the ensemble.\n\nLeung, who will make her debut on \"Bridgerton\" as Lady Araminta Gun, walked the red carpet in a black Toni Maticevski dress.\n\nIts strapless, scooped neckline formed points for a touch of drama before flowing into a corset bodice. The skirt was structured, poofing out around her waist in a dramatic ball-gown shape before flowing back into a pencil skirt. The center of the dress was made of ribbed fabric, adding dimension.\n\nChopard jewelry and strappy Christian Louboutin heels completed the look. Between the classic detailing, modern flair, and dark color, the dress was the perfect red-carpet companion for the wicked stepmother role Leung will play on the show.\n\nRhimes looked every bit the queen of the ton in the silver gown she wore to the premiere, which was styled by Dana Asher Levine.\n\nThe strapless gown had a slight point in the center of the straight neckline, and it cinched at Rhimes' waist with a belt. The entire gown was covered in silver and bronze sequins arranged in vertical strips, shimmering as Rhimes walked.\n\nThe pièce de résistance was a cape that coordinated with the gown. It sat on Rhimes' shoulder and flowed to the floor, giving the look a regal edge that was more than fitting for the occasion.",

    "title": "Passengers flying to Paris spent 21 hours stranded in the remote nation of Turkmenistan before a spare plane came to rescue them",
    "description": "Turkmenistan is one of the most sparsely populated and most isolated countries on earth. Air France passengers spent nearly a day delayed there.",
    "fullText": "Air France passengers were delayed by nearly two days after they were diverted to Turkmenistan.\n\nMonday's Flight 191 was already running 21 hours late when it departed Bengaluru, India, shortly after 11 p.m., according to data from Flightradar24. It was supposed to land in Paris about 10 hours later.\n\nHowever, four hours into the journey, the Boeing 777 started descending. It made a U-turn to land in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, a sparsely populated nation in Central Asia.\n\nRegistered as F-GSPI, the jet is 26 years old. The cause of the diversion has not been confirmed, though The Independent reported that the plane suffered an engine issue.\n\nPassengers then had to wait nearly another whole day to continue their journey to Paris. Turkmenistan is ruled by what Human Rights Watch has described as a totalitarian, hereditary government and is one of the world's most politically secluded countries.\n\nAir France did not respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nGiven that the flight departed from India, there were a number of Indian nationals on board, who were hosted by the nation's consulate in Turkmenistan. It is unclear where the majority of the passengers on the flight stayed during their time in Ashgabat.\n\nConsular Officials of @IndiainTurkmen1 met the Indian passengers of Air France Flight AF 191 which made an emergency landing at Ashgabat Airport earlier today and assured them of Embassy's full support for their smooth onward journey to Paris.@IndianDiplomacy @DrSJaishankar pic.twitter.com/nxVnhQj5DG\n\nUltimately, a new aircraft was dispatched to collect the passengers. Flight-tracking data shows another Air France Boeing 777 left Paris on Tuesday morning and arrived in Ashgabat after a five-hour flight.\n\nIt spent about three hours on the ground before departing Turkmenistan shortly after 1 a.m. That's nearly 22 hours after the passengers first arrived there.\n\nThe plane then landed in the French capital at 3:23 a.m. on Wednesday. Along with the departure delay, that's 43 hours later than passengers initially expected to get there.\n\nFlight-tracking data appears to show that the original plane is still on the ground in Ashgabat as of Thursday morning, three days after it landed there.\n\nThis wasn't the first time that Air France has sent a plane to rescue stranded passengers.\n\nIn May 2024, one of its Boeing 787s was flying from Paris to Seattle when a burning smell was detected in the cabin.\n\nThe pilots declared an emergency and diverted to Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's Nunavut territory. A different flight was canceled so a Boeing 777 could take the passengers to New York.",

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — Lens has gone from surprise front-runner to serious title contender in Ligue 1.\n\nDespite having modest resources, coach Pierre Sage has done remarkably well to keep his side ahead of defending champion Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nCash-rich PSG clinched a record-extending 13th league title last season while Lens won its only title in 1998. But Lens pushed PSG close in 2022-23 and finished runner-up by one point.\n\nLens is one point ahead of PSG this season and eight clear of third-place Marseille going into this weekend's 18th round of games.\n\nSage’s side will be confident of a club record-extending 10th straight win in all competitions when it hosts next-to-last Auxerre on Saturday.\n\nExcellent teamwork and a strong defense are hallmarks of a Lens side which has five clean sheets in the past nine games.\n\nPSG has a tricky home match against fourth-placed Lille on Friday at Parc des Princes, just days after being knocked out of the French Cup at home by capital city rival Paris FC.\n\nInconsistent Marseille is at mid-table Angers on Saturday and can ill afford to drop any points with Lille level on points.\n\nErratic Monaco has tumbled to midtable and needs to bounce back with a home win against Lorient on Friday.\n\nLyon fans will be hoping to see Brazil forward Endrick in action at home to Brest on Sunday.\n\nEndrick is on loan from Real Madrid until the end of the season and scored on his club debut in the French Cup on Sunday.\n\nAfter missing 14 games due to a shoulder injury, Marseille forward Amine Gouiri is finding his form. He scored twice and provided one assist in a 9-0 French Cup win on Tuesday.\n\nNantes has earned a reputation over the years for having a strong youth academy and Tylel Tati is the latest to come through. The 17-year-old central defender looked assured in a 2-0 win at Marseille and looks set to feature at home to Paris FC on Sunday. Forward Jonathan Ikoné seeks his first league goal of the season after his neat finish knocked title holder PSG — his former club — out of the French Cup.\n\nPaul Pogba's move to Monaco is not working out as planned and the former France midfield star remains sidelined with a calf injury.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup winner has also dealt with thigh and ankle problems since joining the club in the offseason, after more than two years out of the game in a career derailed by injuries, off-field problems and a doping ban.\n\nPogba hoped to relaunch his career in time to make France's squad for the World Cup later this year but has so far played only 30 minutes in three substitute appearances for Monaco.\n\nMonaco's injury list is long, including defender Mohammed Salisu (ACL), winger Ansu Fati (hamstring), goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky (knee) and winger Takumi Minamino (ACL).\n\nForwards Jérémie Boga and Terem Moffi are reportedly trying to terminate their contracts with Nice after being attacked by their own supporters following a game on Nov. 30.\n\nAfter a 3-1 defeat at Lorient made it six straight losses, Nice players were confronted by a large number of angry Nice fans when they returned to the club’s training and academy center.\n\nBoga and Moffi took blows to the head and groin and have since been on medical leave. According to sports daily L'Équipe, their case is being examined by the French soccer league's legal committee.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

    "fullText": "Paris Saint-Germain are showing interest in Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez, according to L’Equipe.\n\nThe Parisians have not initiated a move to sign him this winter window, but they could come for his signature this summer.\n\nFernandez is reportedly considering his future at Chelsea, and PSG could pounce and snap him up.\n\nThe Argentine international has bagged eight goals and three assists in 30 appearances for the Blues this season.\n\nLast term, he was Chelsea’s most productive player, scoring nine goals and providing 17 assists in 53 appearances.\n\nFernandez would be a stellar addition to a PSG midfield that already includes Vitinha, Joao Neves, Fabian Ruiz, and stellar prospect Warren Zaire-Emery.\n\nThe price of any deal could prove a sticking point. Chelsea paid around £105 million to sign him from Benfica and will likely be hoping to make a profit from a potential sale.\n\nMore likely, the West Londoners will fight tooth and nail to keep hold of the 24-year-old, who is one of the best in the world in his position.\n\nNot many players can dictate a game like him when he sits deep, and he is also an effective box-crasher. It will be difficult to replace his skillset.\n\nInstead of entertaining bids, Chelsea’s focus should be on protecting and supporting Fernandez.\n\nElite teams do not sell their midfield anchors in their prime. They build around them.\n\nWhat the Blues clearly need is a reliable deputy who can replace Fernandez without a catastrophic drop-off in control, allowing him to play fewer games across a long season.\n\nToo often, Chelsea look disjointed when he is overworked or forced to play through fatigue.\n\nFernandez is the reference point in possession, the tempo-setter and the connective tissue between defence and attack.\n\nPlayers of that calibre are almost impossible to replace, regardless of price.\n\nFor Chelsea, the smarter move is succession planning and depth, not self-sabotage.",

In bad news, Lucas Hernandez has been unexpectedly ruled out.\n\nPSG will face Paris FC this Monday in the Coupe de France round of 16 without any reinforcements from the medical room. Luis Enrique has received no good news from the infirmary in recent hours, as shown by the day's medical update, which the club has just released.\n\nThe three injury absentees remain the same. But to these expected absences has been added bad news, namely that Lucas Hernandez is ill and \"is resting.\"\n\nRegarding the three injured players, PSG specifies that \"Quentin Ndjantou continues his treatment protocol,\" while Kang In Lee and Matvei Safonov are doing adapted work.\"\n\nThe return is relatively close for the latter two, particularly the South Korean. For the Russian goalkeeper, a return to competition was previously mentioned for late January or early February after his left-hand fracture.\n\nGiven that Achraf Hakimi and Ibrahim Mbaye are still involved in the Africa Cup of Nations – the Moroccan fullback and Senegalese winger will play their respective semifinals next Wednesday – this means there will be no fewer than six absentees on PSG's side for this second derby of the season against Paris FC.\n\nThe medical update before PSG vs. Paris FC:\n\nQuentin Ndjantou continues his treatment protocol.\n\nKang In Lee and Matvei Safonov are doing adapted work.\n\nRoundtablesports is Free to join!

    "fullText": "Bradley Barcola is the player in question with the Frenchman consistently linked with an Anfield switch over the last year or so.\n\nLast term, the former Lyon man was one of Luis Enrique's standout players and even though PSG want to keep him, it feels like his future could be away from the Parc de Princes.\n\nOf course, the Reds aren't the only team who have been vying for his transfer but with Manchester City already beating Liverpool to the signing of Antoine Semenyo, Slot and Hughes aren't likely to let another one of their targets slip away.\n\nAnd now, after an update from French outlet RMC Sport, Liverpool's move for Barcola may be closer than ever.\n\nPSG have 'offered a contract' to the Frenchman but his team are yet to respond to their offer.\n\nThe reigning Ligue 1 champions wish to 'know the players position' soon as their next transfer window is likely to be influenced, especially if Barcola chooses to exit.\n\nThe French club are 'preparing for all eventualities' and they already have a shortlist jotted down with Barcola being one of PSG's 'key issues.'\n\nThe report rounds things up by stating Liverpool have been interested in the past with the club having another chance to make their move for the attacker.\n\nOne of the main areas that Liverpool are lacking firepower within their squad is their left-wing.\n\nHughes chose to move Luis Diaz on in the summer and even though Slot wanted to sign a new winger, the higher-ups at the club refused.\n\nIndeed, Gakpo's natural position is on the left-wing but since his form has been miles off the pace this term, others such as Florian Wirtz have had to fill in to try and create chances for Liverpool.\n\nGranted, Barcola is likely to be used on the left, the fact he can play anywhere across the front three is a massive bonus.\n\nUnfortunately, a move is unlikely to take place in the winter transfer window but, if Slot is still the man at the helm by the time summer comes around, he could force the higher-ups to dip into the market for a left-winger.\n\nBarcola's ability has also been laid bare more than once with Enrique even dubbing him a 'superb' player which gives the Reds yet another reason to make their move.",

    "fullText": "Eredivisie giants Ajax are considering a winter loan move for Manchester United midfielder Manuel Ugarte, according to Voetbal International.​\n\nUgarte joined United from Paris Saint-Germain for around €50 million in the summer of 2024, but struggled for a consistent starting role in England.\n\nHe has started only six of United’s twenty Premier League matches this season, a limited role that has pushed him to seek more regular minutes.\n\nWhile Ugarte is open to moving to Amsterdam on a temporary basis, his salary remains a stumbling block given Ajax’s current wage structure.\n\nAny loan deal would therefore have to be with Manchester United continuing to cover a significant portion of his wages, and this will require tough negotiations between the clubs.\n\nUgarte is contracted to United until 2029 and is also attracting interest from other clubs, including Turkish giants Galatasaray, which means Ajax will face competition if talks progress.​\n\nAjax are in the market for a defensive midfielder, and while Ugarte is considered a serious short-term option, the Eredivisie giants are also keeping an eye on long-term solutions.\n\nMeanwhile, alongside Ugarte, Daley Blind is also viewed as another potential addition.\n\nWith Blind’s Girona contract expiring in the summer, any January transfer will be expected to come at a modest fee.\n\nAjax see the Dutch veteran as a cost-effective option who could contribute on the pitch and later transition into a mentoring or off-field role in Amsterdam.​\n\nAfter a horrid spell between September 30 and November 25, when Ajax won just one of 10 matches across all competitions, De Godenzonen have won six and drawn one of their subsequent seven games.\n\nHowever, they remain a whopping 16 points shy of PSV Eindhoven in the title race.",

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — It's taken quite some time, but the first capital city derby in French men's league soccer since 1990 takes place on Sunday when Paris Saint-Germain hosts Paris FC.\n\nA very local derby, too, with PSG's Parc des Princes stadium literally across the street from PFC's new home ground — 44 meters away according to the Paris City Hall website.\n\nAfter winning promotion last season, Paris FC changed stadium and now plays at Stade Jean-Bouin, which traditionally held rugby matches.\n\nSunday's contest pits the defending French and European champion against a side struggling in the top tier. PFC has lost half its games, and was 14th in the 18-team league heading into this weekend's 17th round.\n\nPFC's top scorer this season is skillful midfielder Ilan Kebbal with six goals, more than any PSG player. But he is away with Algeria at the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nPSG has coped with injuries to star forwards Ousmane Dembélé and Désiré Doué this season. That might have affected results because, for a change, PSG is not top but in second spot behind surprise leader Lens. Heading into Sunday's derby, PSG had already lost two league games, as many defeats as all last season.\n\nWhile PSG has won a record 13 French league titles and 16 French Cups, PFC's trophy cabinet is bare. The PFC men's team has never won the league or even a cup.\n\nPSG has been bankrolled by Qatari investor QSI since being taken over in June 2011. Last season, PSG generated club-record revenue of 837 million euros ($976 million).\n\nParis FC's takeover late last year by France's richest family, the Arnaults of luxury empire LVMH, promised to spice up Ligue 1.\n\nParis FC owner Antoine Arnault is the son of billionaire Bernard Arnault, and the family's cash input will prove crucial to the chances of PFC becoming a serious rival to PSG. Antoine used to be a PSG season-ticket holder and enjoys a cordial relationship with PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaïfi.\n\nBefore this season, PSG’s previous city rival was Matra Racing, which became Racing Paris 1 and beat PSG in the last men’s league derby in Paris in 1990. Antoine won't have to wait so long for another derby, because PSG is hosting PFC in the French Cup's last 32 on Jan. 12.\n\nFleeting rivalries, stadium shares\n\nParisian soccer history can be a bit confusing.\n\nParis FC men's team was created in 1969 and merged with Stade Saint-Germain to form Paris Saint-Germain, or PSG, in 1970.\n\nThe merger ended abruptly in 1972 with PSG losing its professional status and PFC staying in division 1, and playing at Parc des Princes. PSG kept the name and returned to play at the stadium in 1974 after winning promotion back to the top flight, coinciding with PFC's relegation.\n\nMatra Racing was only briefly on the scene.\n\nMatra spent a few seasons in the French top flight — sharing the Parc des Princes stadium — but the club faded after French media baron Jean-Luc Lagardère withdrew his backing in 1989. Matra was relegated the following year, when it was called Racing Paris 1, despite beating PSG in the derby.\n\nThere may be more local derbies in the capital next season, with Red Star chasing promotion from Ligue 2.\n\nRed Star is based in the northern suburbs of Paris and is second in Ligue 2. The team has long been respected for being close to its working-class fans in the Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine suburb.\n\nHome games are played at the 5,600-capacity Stade Bauer, which has stands selling food and beer right outside the entrance gates. Red Star’s down-to-earth image has remained the same for decades, with the club becoming increasingly trendy and attracting a new section of fans appreciating its old-school ways.\n\nPlans are in place to increase capacity to 10,000 next year and the club says it hopes to have 80% of homegrown local players in the first team by 2030.\n\nFounded in 1897, Red Star is among the oldest clubs in France. It has a famous founder in Jules Rimet, the longest-serving president in FIFA history (1921-54), and the World Cup trophy was named after him.\n\nRed Star's period of success was after World War I, with the club winning four French Cups in the 1920s.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

    "fullText": "Sydney Lake is an associate editor at Fortune, where she writes and edits news for the publication's global news desk.\n\nConsidering Paris Hilton is worth an estimated $300 million to $400 million, it might seem odd that she reportedly took out a mortgage on her recent home purchase.\n\nHilton, whose vast wealth comes from 19 product lines, real estate, media and entertainment, brand partnerships, and her reality show, The Simple Life, bought actor Mark Wahlberg’s former estate in Beverly Hills earlier this year for a whopping $63 million.\n\nBut what wasn’t reported at the time was that Hilton and her entrepreneur husband, Carter Reum, reportedly took out a mortgage on the home, which might seem like an unusual move for the 44-year-old hotel heiress. And what’s seemingly even more strange is they reportedly took out the loan after they had already bought the 12-bed, 20-bath home, which shows a $43.75 million mortgage with JPMorgan Chase at an interest rate of 5.25%.\n\nA post shared by Houses (@houses)\n\nBut this type of arrangement isn’t as rare as it may seem, real-estate experts say.\n\n“It surprises many people, but it’s actually quite common for the mega-wealthy to take out mortgages—even when they could write a check for the full purchase price,” Evan Harlow, real estate agent at Maui Elite Property, told Fortune.\n\nIn fact, public records show ultrawealthy celebrities including Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Elon Musk, and even Mark Zuckerberg have financed their homes.\n\n“The takeaway for the average buyer isn’t to mimic their precise approach, but to understand the principle,” Harlow said. “Sometimes the smartest financial move isn’t paying everything off, but keeping your money flexible and working for you.”\n\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive to take out a mortgage in today’s market, where rates are still hovering in the 6% range, it can actually be a savvy move for ultrahigh-net-worth individuals.\n\nIn fact, just because someone has the net worth to buy a home outright, that “doesn’t mean that’s how they want to allocate their cash,” Miltiadis Kastanis, director of luxury sales for Compass, based in South Florida, told Fortune.\n\n“Ultrahigh-net-worth individuals think differently about liquidity and leverage; they’d rather keep their money working for them in investments, businesses, or even art, rather than tying it all up in one property,” said Kastanis, who has represented high-profile celebrities in real estate transactions.\n\nIn other words, using a mortgage helps to free up capital for higher-yield investments or business ventures, according to Harlow. He used the example of one of his clients, the owner of a successful tech business, who recently purchased a $3 million property and decided on a jumbo loan. The client didn’t have to do that, but he wanted to keep his cash in the market, where his portfolio, over the long term, was reaping annualized returns well over the mortgage rate.\n\n“For him, buying a house with cash sounded like ‘just parking money in the driveway,’ as opposed to putting it to work,” Harlow said.\n\nBoth Harlow and Kastanis also said ultrahigh-net-worth individuals see mortgages differently from other people. People like Hilton view it more as a tool instead of a burden.\n\n“For many wealthy buyers, a mortgage is just another lever they can pull in their overall wealth strategy,” Kastanis said. “They’re playing chess, not checkers.”\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on September 2, 2025.",

He was also expected to \"greet fans before and after each game\".\n\nThe truth behind the ethics bonus is very different.\n\nIn English football, clubs are able to fine a player up to two weeks' wages for a misdemeanour.\n\nFrench law forbids any deductions from a worker's salary. Sports teams therefore make a small portion of it an ethics bonus. The base wage and the ethics bonus are in effect a player's total salary.\n\nIn 2021 it was claimed in some reports that Neymar received extra money for clapping the fans, but the details paint a different picture.\n\nNeymar was expected to behave responsibly to sponsors and referees. He had to turn up to training on time and was barred from placing bets. In effect, it was a moral code.\n\n\"Clubs are very keen to protect their image,\" football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\n\"They don't want anybody going nuclear and criticising the club, which means that they call them good behaviour clauses.\n\n\"We saw similar with Tiger Woods and Lance Armstrong [who had morals clauses with sponsors]. So behavioural clauses are quite common within sport.\"\n\nIn 2018, Marco Verratti had part of his ethics bonus withheld after being caught drink-driving.\n\nHatem Ben Arfa also lost the bonus when he failed to attend PSG's mid-season training camp in Qatar.\n\nIn 2023, Lionel Messi was punished by PSG after making an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia.\n\nRugby union club Racing 92 took action against winger Teddy Thomas by \"retaining his ethics bonus for February\" after an incident following a Six Nations match between France and Scotland.\n\nBonuses are now a large part of a player's contract. They cover loyalty payments, received each year on the anniversary of a player joining a club, through to image rights and goal bonuses.\n\n\"The contract which used to be written on the back of a napkin is now an investment by a series of stakeholders,\" Maguire said.\n\n\"You've got the club, you've got the agent, you've got the management company, you've got the player. And quite often the player's intellectual property rights company as well.\n\n\"I've seen some of the big six contracts, and there are 25% uplifts for Champions League participation.\"\n\nThe world's best players are in such high demand they could earn huge top-ups through their image rights, as high as \"60% basic and another 40% on top of that\", Maguire added.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "fullText": "Considering we're awaiting word of a (likely) sixth season renewal, it's undeniable that Emily in Paris has been an unqualified success for Netflix, a reliable hit that rivals the success of buzzier genre shows like Stranger Things. Lily Collins stars as the faux pas-prone Emily Cooper, who moves to Paris and lands a temporary job at a glitzy French marketing firm kind of by accident. She doesn't speak the language and doesn't get the culture, but slowly manages to ingratiate herself to the locals while juggling work and romance in a new country. The series hails from Darren Star, creator of Sex and the City, so her budding high-fashion sense and tendency to narrate adventures à la Carrie Bradshaw make perfect sense.\n\nWhile you wait for Emily's next round of misadventures, here are 15 other shows that offer similarly stylish coming-of-age vibes.\n\nInspired by the career of Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Joanna Coles, this show follows three young besties—Jane Sloan (Katie Stevens), Kat Edison (Aisha Dee), and Sutton Brady (Meghann Fahy)—working for the fictional women's magazine Scarlet in NYC. As with Emily's mentors Madeline and Sylvie, the three are never without the firm guiding hand of editor-in-chief, Jacqueline Carlyle (Melora Hardin), as they navigate life and careers in their dramatically stylish world. Stream The Bold Type on Hulu, HBO Max, and Tubi.\n\nNo international travel here (or at least, not until the second season), but we do have a fashion-forward stylist who'd devoted herself to the wrong guy for way too long. As the series opens, Mavis (Beaumont (Michele Buteau, who also co-created the series) is ready for a fresh start, putting herself and career first—which does not preclude falling into a number of romantic entanglements. As she says more than once, she's going to take on the fashion world with a \"body-positive attitude, cute v-neck, and some lip-gloss.\" Stream Survival of the Thickest on Netflix.\n\nBefore Emily in Paris, creator Darren Star produced this two-season prequel to Sex and the City, and it's a good bet for fans of either show. Even as a 16-year-old living in Connecticut, Carrie Bradshaw (AnnaSophia Robb) is firmly on the road to becoming the iconic New York fashionista that we know she'll grow into. The high school junior takes an internship at a law firm in the Big Apple, only to moonlight from that pretty-darn-good gig by taking a second job at Interview magazine. The young Ms. Bradshaw has to balance school, family, a volatile relationship, a budding career, and a new and very outgoing bestie named Samantha (Lindsey Gort). Stream The Carrie Diaries on The CW or buy episodes from Prime Video and Apple TV\n\nThe connection here is largely based on style, as in Mrs. Maisel's impeccable period 1950s pairs nicely with Emily's heightened modern Paris, but there's also the aspect of a young woman striking out on her own, and damn the consequences. Maisel was one of Prime’s first truly buzzy original series, a comedy-drama from Amy Sherman-Palladino (Gilmore Girls) about the title’s Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan), a New York housewife of the late 1950s who discovers a talent for stand-up comedy. Inspired by the real-life careers of comedians like Totie Fields and Joan Rivers, the show is warm and welcoming, with great performances and dialogue; it also achieves something rare in being a show about comedy that’s actually funny. Stream The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel on Prime Video.\n\nAmy Sherman-Palladino and David Palladino returned to TV, and to the ballet world (following Bunheads), for this series about two world-renowned ballet companies (one in NYC and one in Paris) that decide to spice things up by swapping their most talented dancers. Each company is on the brink of financial disaster, and so Jack McMillan (Luke Kirby), director of the Metropolitan Ballet, and Geneviève Lavigne (Charlotte Gainsbourg), director of of Le Ballet National, come up with the plan, and recruit an eccentric billionaire (Simon Callow) to pay for it. Much of the comedy comes from the mismatched natures of their swapped dancers, and there's a tangible love of ballet that keeps things light, despite the fancy title. The focus is a bit more on the dance directors than on the younger dancers, but there's still plenty of impeccable Parisian style on display. Stream Étoile on Prime Video.\n\nRachel Sennott (Shiva Baby, Bottoms) created, produces, writes, and stars as Maia, who is 27, living in LA, and desperate for promotion in her job as an assistant talent manager. She's joined in town by Tallulah (Odessa A’zion), a former New York City influencer fallen on messy times, and an alternately fun and exhausting circle of friends that includes West Hollywood stylist Charlie (Jordan Firstman) and Maia's teacher boyfriend Dylan (Josh Hutcherson). It's a great looking show and, though tolerance for a coming-of-age comedy about twenty-ish-year-olds in LA will vary, it's smartly written and impressively acted. Stream I Love LA on HBO Max.\n\nThere’s no high concept hook here. This critical favorite stars Phoebe Waller-Bridge as the title character (only ever referred to as Fleabag) in a comedy drama about a free-spirited, but also deeply angry single young woman in living in London who shares her romantic ups and downs via confessional asides to us, the audience. So...Emily in Paris, but messier? Waller-Bridge won separate Emmys as the star, creator, and writer of the series (all in the same year), and co-stars Sian Clifford, Olivia Coleman, Fiona Shaw, and Kristin Scott Thomas were lauded as well. Stream Fleabag on Prime Video.\n\nKimberly (Pauline Chalamet) is an endlessly naïve scholarship student; Bela (Amrit Kaur), is an aspiring comedy writer on the make for the hottest guys; Whitney (Alyah Chanelle Scott) is an overachieving athlete and senator’s daughter; Leighton (Reneé Rapp) is a closeted sorority girl. They're randomly assigned to room together as freshmen at the fictional Essex College in Vermont. Created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, this comedy-drama isn't nearly as salacious as its title suggests: There's sex, for sure, but like Sex and the City before it, the funny, queer-friendly show is more about female friendship. Stream The Sex Lives of College Girls on HBO Max.\n\nA young woman movies from the U.S. to France to pursue her dream of dancing. Oh, and also she's magic. A successor to Find Me in Paris, set at that show's same Paris Opera Ballet School, Spellbound introduces a new cast and, where the earlier series dealt with time travel, Spellbound is all about real magic: Fifteen-year-old American Cece Parker Jones travels to Paris to join the prestigious dance school, only to discover that she's an actual witch with a family history of spellcraft. She struggles to balance dance, magic, and her desire to be a normal teenager while dealing with the Mystics, natural enemies to Cece's type of witch. It's a solid and stylish coming-of-age drama. Stream Spellbound on Hulu.\n\nThere's no Chicago gal traveling overseas in this French series, so if you want your Parisian marketing industry workplace dramedy straight up, with no American hand-holding, you're in luck. The series shifts its focus between four talent agents at a prestigious agency who are forced to take the reins following the sudden death of the agency founder. They navigate their messy personal lives while catering to the needs of their real celebrity clients (Juliette Binoche, Monica Bellucci, Isabelle Huppert, and Sigourney Weaver are just some of the name guest stars playing faintly exaggerated versions of themselves). It's soapy, addictive showbiz fun, a dishy delight even if you know not a lick of French. Stream Call My Agent! on Netflix or buy episodes from Prime Video and Apple TV.\n\nTeen drama at its finest and most bitchy, Gossip Girl follows the many, many scandals of a group of young Upper East Side socialites and hangers-on. The tangled teenage lives of Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively), her best frenemy Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester), scholarship kid Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley), and plenty more pretty young boys and girls are chronicled in meticulous detail by the title's mysterious, omnipresent Gossip Girl (voiced by Kristen Bell). This one shares with Emily an impeccable sense of style, as its leads never miss a fashion beat. The short-lived 2021 follow-up is also available on HBO Max. Stream Gossip Girl on HBO Max and Netflix.\n\nJust as Emily's tourist kitsch gets her read for filth in the opening episode of her series, Betty Suarez (America Ferrera) has a...let's say \"distinct\" sense of fashion that sets her much apart from the rest of the striving staffers at the prestigious fashion magazine Mode, where she manages to land a job despite not quite fitting into the mold (her opening episode poncho is, of course, iconic). Betty's only coming from Queens, but her adult braces and good heart set her well apart in the catty, high-pressure world of NYC fashion. Stream Ugly Betty on Hulu.\n\nBased on the novel of the same name from Stephanie Danler, drawing on her experiences as an NYC waitress, Sweetbitter stars Yellowjackets' Ella Purnell as Tess, 21 at the series' opening, as she arrives in the city and gets a job at a prestigious restaurant. As we (and she) quickly learn, there's at least as much drama (including drugs, booze, and sex) in the restaurant industry as there is in the world of social media. Stream Sweetbitter on Prime Video.\n\nAnother Darren Star show, this one's seven-season run overlapped just a bit with Emily. It flips a more common premise on its head: rather than a young woman seeking to make a name for herself, Younger follows Liza Miller (Sutton Foster), a recently divorced woman in her 40s who finds that her age is a barrier to reentering the publishing industry she left years earlier. After a compliment convinces her that she could pass for a younger woman, she lies that she's just 26 in order to land an entry-level job. Misadventures ensue. Think of it as a story of coming-of-age, again. Stream Younger on Netflix.\n\nHow about Emily in Paris for real? This hard-hitting documentary series follows the lives of American ex-pats in Paris...just kidding, it's a Bravo reality show. Still, the vibes are not at all dissimilar, though this bit of reality TV nonsense somehow feels more heightened than the scripted drama of Emily (which probably inspired it). Six women trying to make names for themselves in the City of Lights: one a fashion designer, one an art historian, one an English teacher, etc. What they all share is a level of impeccable fashion that most people only experience by starring in a TV show.

    "fullText": "Paris Saint-Germain have been ordered by a Paris labour court to pay Kylian Mbappe €60 million in unpaid salary and bonuses, bringing an end to a prolonged legal dispute between the club and their former forward.\n\nThe ruling, delivered earlier today, follows months of proceedings after Mbappe claimed PSG withheld wages and contractual bonuses in the final months of his deal before his free transfer to Real Madrid in the summer of 2024.\n\nThe France captain argued that payments for April, May and June of that year were never made, despite being stipulated in his contract.\n\nJudges ruled in Mbappe’s favour, concluding that PSG failed to pay three months of salary as well as an ethics bonus and a signing bonus.\n\nThe court noted that these outstanding sums had already been recognised by the French Professional Football League in decisions taken in September and October last year, strengthening the player’s case.\n\nPSG attempted to argue that Mbappe had agreed to forgo the payments as part of an informal arrangement linked to his reintegration into the squad during the 2023-24 season.\n\nHowever, the court stated that the club was unable to provide any written agreement proving that the player had waived his contractual rights, leading to that defence being dismissed.\n\nMbappe’s lawyer, Frederique Cassereau, welcomed the ruling and described it as a predictable outcome under French labour law. She said the decision simply reflected the fact that salaries and bonuses written into a contract must be paid in full.\n\nWhile Mbappe succeeded in securing the €60m award, the court rejected several additional claims made on his behalf.\n\nAllegations of moral harassment, concealed work and breaches of the employer’s duty of care were all dismissed, and the court declined to reclassify his fixed-term contract as a permanent one, which limited the scope for further compensation.\n\nPSG had also accused Mbappe of acting disloyally by concealing his intention not to renew his contract, arguing that this deprived the club of the chance to secure a significant transfer fee.\n\nThe judges ruled that such considerations were not relevant to the core issue of unpaid remuneration and therefore had no bearing on the outcome.\n\nMbappe spent seven years at PSG after initially joining from Monaco in 2017, winning six Ligue 1 titles and 15 major trophies. He left as the club’s all-time leading scorer with 256 goals in 308 appearances.\n\nThe verdict closes a contentious chapter in the relationship between PSG and their former talisman and confirms the club’s obligation to settle the outstanding payments in full.",

    "fullText": "Paris St-Germain have been ordered to pay former striker Kylian Mbappe 60 million euros (£52.5m) in unpaid salary and bonuses by a French court.\n\nMbappe had been seeking 263m euros (£231.5m) from his former club after the long-running dispute reached a Paris labour court in November.\n\nThe European champions were counter suing the France captain for 240m euros (£211m).\n\nThe 26-year-old Real Madrid forward claimed the nine-figure sum, which included 55m euros (£46.3m) in unpaid wages, as damages in response to a contract dispute and ill-treatment by the club.\n\nHowever, he has only been awarded a fraction of that amount, with the court recognising that PSG had failed to pay three months of his salary between April and June 2024 as well as an ethics bonus and a signing bonus under his contract.\n\n\"We are satisfied with this ruling. This is what you could expect when salaries went unpaid,\" Mbappe's lawyer Frederique Cassereau said.\n\nPSG had been seeking compensation for Mbappe's failed 300m euros transfer to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in 2023.\n\nHe joined Spanish giants Real Madrid on a free transfer the following summer.\n\nIn a statement, Mbappe's legal team added: \"This judgement confirms that commitments entered into must be honoured. It restores a simple truth: even in the professional football industry, labour law applies to everyone.\n\n\"Mr Mbappe, for his part, scrupulously respected his sporting and contractual obligations for seven years, right up to the final day.\"",
