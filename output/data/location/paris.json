    "fullText": "Paris St-Germain and France forward Ousmane Dembele has been named the men's player of the year at the Fifa Best awards.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who won the Ballon d'Or in September, picked up the Fifa award in Qatar on Tuesday after helping PSG to four trophies in the 2024-25 season.\n\nThe former Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund player, who joined PSG in 2023, had 51 goal contributions in 53 games for Luis Enrique's side last term.\n\nAfter helping PSG to a first Champions League triumph, Dembele beat Barcelona's Lamine Yamal and Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe to the prestigious individual award.\n\nDembele was present at the awards ceremony before his side's Intercontinental Cup final against Flamengo on Wednesday.\n\nThe award, which is based off events from August 2024 to August 2025, is voted for by men's national team coaches, men's national team captains, journalists and fans.\n\nThe Frenchman's success underlines his status as one of the best players in the world.\n\nDembele initially struggled for form during the first half of the 2024-25 campaign but saw his season spark into life after being redeployed as a central forward.\n\nEight of his 35 goals came in the Champions League last season, including crucial strikes against Liverpool and Arsenal in the knockout stages.\n\nDembele joins an illustrious list of names, including Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, to have won the award since its inception in 2016.\n\nIn total, he has scored three goals and provided three assists for PSG across all competitions this term.\n\nOn the international stage, meanwhile, Dembele helped France qualify for next summer's World Cup, where the two-time winners will face Senegal, Norway, and one of the play-off winners in the group stage.\n\nIn total, six players involved in PSG's 2024-25 season were named in the team of the year, while Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk and Chelsea's Cole Palmer were the only representatives who played in the Premier League last term.\n\nThe players selected were Gianluigi Donnarumma (PSG/Man City), Achraf Hakimi (PSG), Willian Pacho (PSG), Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool), Nuno Mendes (PSG), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Vitinha (PSG), Pedri (Barcelona), Lamine Yamal (Barcelona) and Ousmane Dembele (PSG).\n\nIndependiente winger Santiago Montiel won the Puskas Award for the stunning overhead kick he scored against Independiente Rivadavia in Argentina's Primera Division.\n\nThe 25-year-old's incredible acrobatic effort was enough to earn a 1-0 win for his side in May and left opposition goalkeeper Ezequiel Centurion rooted to the spot.\n\nMontiel, who is the second successive Argentine to win the award after Alejandro Garnacho in 2024, said: \"I didn't think about it, I just hit it.\"\n\nArsenal and England midfielder Declan Rice was shortlisted for the award for the second of two free-kicks he scored against Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.\n\nEarlier in the night, Manchester City's Donnarumma was named the Fifa Men's goalkeeper of the year for 2025.\n\nThe Italian shot-stopper, 26, played a key role in PSG's Champions League triumph last season before moving to Etihad Stadium in September.\n\nDonnarumma, who kept a clean sheet in the final against Inter Milan in May, finished ahead of Premier League goalkeepers Alisson Becker, Emi Martinez, David Raya and Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois to win the award for the first time.\n\nIn addition to the Champions League, Donnarumma helped PSG win Ligue 1, Coupe de France and the Trophee des Champions titles during the 2024-25 season.\n\nAfter guiding PSG to four trophies over the course of the 2024-25 campaign, Luis Enrique was crowned coach of the year on Tuesday night.\n\nThe 55-year-old, who has been at the helm since 2023, masterminded victories over Liverpool, Arsenal and Inter Milan to help the French side secure a first Champions League triumph.\n\nThe former Barcelona manager beat Liverpool's Arne Slot and Barcelona's Hansi Flick to the award.\n\nHowever, he was unable to make the award ceremony night, with PSG's assistant manager Rafel Pol Cabanellas accepting the award on the Spaniard's behalf.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Paris Saint-Germain must pay their former player Kylian Mbappé more than €60 million ($70.7 million) in unpaid wages and bonuses, a Paris labour court ruled on Tuesday.\n\nThe France star left for Real Madrid on a free transfer in 2024 but became embroiled in a dispute with the French champions over what he was entitled to after seven years at the Parc des Princes.\n\nThe legal tussle, lasting one and a half years, is not over, as both parties can now appeal to the appeals court.\n\nPSG, annoyed that he had run out his contract and left for free when they could have commanded a possible world record free, were seeking damages of their own from Mbappé.\n\nAt a hearing before the labour court in November, the 26-year-old demanded €263 million from PSG, while the club demanded €440 million from the player.\n\nThe judges sided with the 2018 World Cup winner, but reduced the amount they believed the striker was due.\n\nIronically, PSG won their first Champions League title in May without Mbappé, having abandoned their previous policy of buying the world's very best and instead moulding a well-oiled team.",

    "fullText": "Paris Saint-Germain have been ordered by a Paris labour court to pay Kylian Mbappe €60 million in unpaid salary and bonuses, bringing an end to a prolonged legal dispute between the club and their former forward.\n\nThe ruling, delivered earlier today, follows months of proceedings after Mbappe claimed PSG withheld wages and contractual bonuses in the final months of his deal before his free transfer to Real Madrid in the summer of 2024.\n\nThe France captain argued that payments for April, May and June of that year were never made, despite being stipulated in his contract.\n\nJudges ruled in Mbappe’s favour, concluding that PSG failed to pay three months of salary as well as an ethics bonus and a signing bonus.\n\nThe court noted that these outstanding sums had already been recognised by the French Professional Football League in decisions taken in September and October last year, strengthening the player’s case.\n\nPSG attempted to argue that Mbappe had agreed to forgo the payments as part of an informal arrangement linked to his reintegration into the squad during the 2023-24 season.\n\nHowever, the court stated that the club was unable to provide any written agreement proving that the player had waived his contractual rights, leading to that defence being dismissed.\n\nMbappe’s lawyer, Frederique Cassereau, welcomed the ruling and described it as a predictable outcome under French labour law. She said the decision simply reflected the fact that salaries and bonuses written into a contract must be paid in full.\n\nWhile Mbappe succeeded in securing the €60m award, the court rejected several additional claims made on his behalf.\n\nAllegations of moral harassment, concealed work and breaches of the employer’s duty of care were all dismissed, and the court declined to reclassify his fixed-term contract as a permanent one, which limited the scope for further compensation.\n\nPSG had also accused Mbappe of acting disloyally by concealing his intention not to renew his contract, arguing that this deprived the club of the chance to secure a significant transfer fee.\n\nThe judges ruled that such considerations were not relevant to the core issue of unpaid remuneration and therefore had no bearing on the outcome.\n\nMbappe spent seven years at PSG after initially joining from Monaco in 2017, winning six Ligue 1 titles and 15 major trophies. He left as the club’s all-time leading scorer with 256 goals in 308 appearances.\n\nThe verdict closes a contentious chapter in the relationship between PSG and their former talisman and confirms the club’s obligation to settle the outstanding payments in full.",

    "fullText": "Paris St-Germain have been ordered to pay former striker Kylian Mbappe 60 million euros (£52.5m) in unpaid salary and bonuses by a French court.\n\nMbappe had been seeking 263m euros (£231.5m) from his former club after the long-running dispute reached a Paris labour court in November.\n\nThe European champions were counter suing the France captain for 240m euros (£211m).\n\nThe 26-year-old Real Madrid forward claimed the nine-figure sum, which included 55m euros (£46.3m) in unpaid wages, as damages in response to a contract dispute and ill-treatment by the club.\n\nHowever, he has only been awarded a fraction of that amount, with the court recognising that PSG had failed to pay three months of his salary between April and June 2024 as well as an ethics bonus and a signing bonus under his contract.\n\n\"We are satisfied with this ruling. This is what you could expect when salaries went unpaid,\" Mbappe's lawyer Frederique Cassereau said.\n\nPSG had been seeking compensation for Mbappe's failed 300m euros transfer to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in 2023.\n\nHe joined Spanish giants Real Madrid on a free transfer the following summer.\n\nIn a statement, Mbappe's legal team added: \"This judgement confirms that commitments entered into must be honoured. It restores a simple truth: even in the professional football industry, labour law applies to everyone.\n\n\"Mr Mbappe, for his part, scrupulously respected his sporting and contractual obligations for seven years, right up to the final day.\"",
