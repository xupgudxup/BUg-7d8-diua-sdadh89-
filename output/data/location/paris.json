    "fullText": "Paris Saint-Germain must pay their former player Kylian Mbappé more than €60 million ($70.7 million) in unpaid wages and bonuses, a Paris labour court ruled on Tuesday.\n\nThe France star left for Real Madrid on a free transfer in 2024 but became embroiled in a dispute with the French champions over what he was entitled to after seven years at the Parc des Princes.\n\nThe legal tussle, lasting one and a half years, is not over, as both parties can now appeal to the appeals court.\n\nPSG, annoyed that he had run out his contract and left for free when they could have commanded a possible world record free, were seeking damages of their own from Mbappé.\n\nAt a hearing before the labour court in November, the 26-year-old demanded €263 million from PSG, while the club demanded €440 million from the player.\n\nThe judges sided with the 2018 World Cup winner, but reduced the amount they believed the striker was due.\n\nIronically, PSG won their first Champions League title in May without Mbappé, having abandoned their previous policy of buying the world's very best and instead moulding a well-oiled team.",

    "fullText": "Paris Saint-Germain have been ordered by a Paris labour court to pay Kylian Mbappe €60 million in unpaid salary and bonuses, bringing an end to a prolonged legal dispute between the club and their former forward.\n\nThe ruling, delivered earlier today, follows months of proceedings after Mbappe claimed PSG withheld wages and contractual bonuses in the final months of his deal before his free transfer to Real Madrid in the summer of 2024.\n\nThe France captain argued that payments for April, May and June of that year were never made, despite being stipulated in his contract.\n\nJudges ruled in Mbappe’s favour, concluding that PSG failed to pay three months of salary as well as an ethics bonus and a signing bonus.\n\nThe court noted that these outstanding sums had already been recognised by the French Professional Football League in decisions taken in September and October last year, strengthening the player’s case.\n\nPSG attempted to argue that Mbappe had agreed to forgo the payments as part of an informal arrangement linked to his reintegration into the squad during the 2023-24 season.\n\nHowever, the court stated that the club was unable to provide any written agreement proving that the player had waived his contractual rights, leading to that defence being dismissed.\n\nMbappe’s lawyer, Frederique Cassereau, welcomed the ruling and described it as a predictable outcome under French labour law. She said the decision simply reflected the fact that salaries and bonuses written into a contract must be paid in full.\n\nWhile Mbappe succeeded in securing the €60m award, the court rejected several additional claims made on his behalf.\n\nAllegations of moral harassment, concealed work and breaches of the employer’s duty of care were all dismissed, and the court declined to reclassify his fixed-term contract as a permanent one, which limited the scope for further compensation.\n\nPSG had also accused Mbappe of acting disloyally by concealing his intention not to renew his contract, arguing that this deprived the club of the chance to secure a significant transfer fee.\n\nThe judges ruled that such considerations were not relevant to the core issue of unpaid remuneration and therefore had no bearing on the outcome.\n\nMbappe spent seven years at PSG after initially joining from Monaco in 2017, winning six Ligue 1 titles and 15 major trophies. He left as the club’s all-time leading scorer with 256 goals in 308 appearances.\n\nThe verdict closes a contentious chapter in the relationship between PSG and their former talisman and confirms the club’s obligation to settle the outstanding payments in full.",

    "fullText": "Paris St-Germain have been ordered to pay former striker Kylian Mbappe 60 million euros (£52.5m) in unpaid salary and bonuses by a French court.\n\nMbappe had been seeking 263m euros (£231.5m) from his former club after the long-running dispute reached a Paris labour court in November.\n\nThe European champions were counter suing the France captain for 240m euros (£211m).\n\nThe 26-year-old Real Madrid forward claimed the nine-figure sum, which included 55m euros (£46.3m) in unpaid wages, as damages in response to a contract dispute and ill-treatment by the club.\n\nHowever, he has only been awarded a fraction of that amount, with the court recognising that PSG had failed to pay three months of his salary between April and June 2024 as well as an ethics bonus and a signing bonus under his contract.\n\n\"We are satisfied with this ruling. This is what you could expect when salaries went unpaid,\" Mbappe's lawyer Frederique Cassereau said.\n\nPSG had been seeking compensation for Mbappe's failed 300m euros transfer to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in 2023.\n\nHe joined Spanish giants Real Madrid on a free transfer the following summer.\n\nIn a statement, Mbappe's legal team added: \"This judgement confirms that commitments entered into must be honoured. It restores a simple truth: even in the professional football industry, labour law applies to everyone.\n\n\"Mr Mbappe, for his part, scrupulously respected his sporting and contractual obligations for seven years, right up to the final day.\"",
