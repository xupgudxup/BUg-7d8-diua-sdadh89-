    "description": "The recent A Safehouse in the Hills update for GTA Online may contain clues about Grand Theft Auto VI, or at least that's what the franchise's passionate fanbase is theorizing based on some recent discoveries.\nAfter the big new update went live on December 10, people dug into the game's code in search of anything that might provide clues about GTA 6, and people think they found some. A line of text that was discovered references a voice line for the character Jimmy, the son of main character Michael, that says he is \"moving out of state.\" Another line, from his mother Amanda, says, \"Our son is finally moving away from home.\" People are taking this to suggest that Jimmy may have moved to Leonida, the stand-in for GTA 6's setting of Florida, but that's just conjecture for now.",

    "fullText": "STARKE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of stabbing a woman to death during a home invasion robbery more than 30 years ago is scheduled to be executed Tuesday evening in Florida.\n\nMark Allen Geralds, 58, is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke. Geralds was convicted of murder, armed robbery, burglary and stealing a car and was sentenced to death in 1990. The Florida Supreme Court later vacated the sentence but affirmed the conviction, and Geralds was resentenced to death in 1992.\n\nIt would be Florida's 18th death sentence carried out in 2025, further extending the state record for total executions in a single year.\n\nAccording to court records, Tressa Pettibone’s 8-year-old son found his mother beaten and stabbed to death on the kitchen floor of their Panama City home in February 1989. Geralds was a carpenter who had previously done remodeling work at the home.\n\nGeralds ran into Pettibone and her children at a shopping mall about a week before the killing, and Pettibone mentioned that her husband was away on business. Geralds later approached Pettibone's son at the video arcade and asked when the boy's father would return and what time he and his sister left for and returned from school each day, according to court records.\n\nInvestigators found that Geralds pawned jewelry with traces of Pettibone’s blood on it, and plastic ties used to bind Pettibone matched ties found in Geralds’ car.\n\nAfter a death warrant was signed last month and his execution date set, Geralds told a judge he did not wish to pursue any further appeals. The judge signed off on that decision.\n\nA total of 44 men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and a handful of executions are scheduled for the rest of the year.\n\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, the highest previous annual total of Florida executions was eight in 2014. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year. Another execution is planned for next week in the state under death warrants signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nFrank Athen Walls, 58, is scheduled for Florida’s 19th execution this year on Dec. 18. He was convicted of fatally shooting a man and woman during a home invasion robbery and later confessing to three other killings.\n\nFlorida's lethal injections are carried out with a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",

Only employees nominated by their superiors for “exemplary service” were awarded the $10,000 bonus.\n\nThe TSA employs over 50,000 transportation security officers out of its approximate 65,000 total employees.\n\nThe DHS did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
