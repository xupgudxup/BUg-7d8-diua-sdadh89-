    "description": "Laura Ziegler led Louisville Cardinals women's basketball past the Florida State Seminoles in an ACC college basketball game Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Louisville women’s basketball was forced to deviate from its normal game-opening play — a pass in the low post to Anaya Hardy for a quick layup — against Florida State on Sunday.\n\nThe Seminoles took the look away from the ninth-ranked Cardinals. The only problem was that their double team left Laura Ziegler open. The senior called for the ball and nailed the shot beyond the arc. One minute later, Taj Roberts found Ziegler in the paint for a layup. After one quarter, Ziegler had either scored or assisted on seven of the Cardinals’ eight made field goals while tallying five rebounds.\n\nThe first 10 minutes of Louisville’s ACC game against Florida State (9-17, 4-10 ACC) is what the Saint Joseph’s transfer has been doing all season. And it yielded a similar result to all but four of the Cardinals’ games as Louisville (24-4, 14-1) took down the Seminoles, 88-65, on Sunday at the KFC Yum! Center.\n\nA day after UofL was projected to be a No. 2 seed in the first NCAA Tournament Top 16 reveal, Ziegler showed why as she helped the team build a 34-20 halftime lead. She neared triple-double territory by finishing with 14 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Louisville was +28 when she was on the court, covered every inch by contributing in some way. That ranged from bringing the ball up the floor to battling in the post or getting the outlet pass for a 3-point shot.\n\nZiegler’s versatility is something head coach Jeff Walz saw from her film at Saint Joseph’s. After getting her on campus, he tried her out at the point forward position.\n\n“She passed the ball well,\" Walz said last week. “And she handles it well enough that at the 4 spot, there aren't many 4 players that are going to pick her up full-court. So, the advantage to her then is like, 'Hey, no one's really harassing me a whole bunch.' And then when teams start to put guards on her, she's bigger than they are so she can see over them. And now we're making the pass up to our guard who's being guarded by a post.”\n\nZiegler has been open to any role the team needs her to play and contributes more than just scoring. Her leadership as one of only two seniors on the roster has been invaluable. Beyond the intangibles, Ziegler leads the team in rebounds per game (7.2) and is second in points (11.5) and assists per game (2.9).\n\nHer all-around effort has helped Louisville to one of its most successful seasons over the past few years and will continue to be important with the postseason looming.\n\nLouisville is off Thursday and returns to the KFC Yum! Center to host Virginia at noon next Sunday.\n\nReach Louisville football, women's basketball and baseball beat writer Alexis Cubit at acubit@gannett.com and follow her on X at @Alexis_Cubit.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Louisville women's basketball, Laura Ziegler roll past Florida State",

    "description": "After starting out conference play 6-1 and sitting in first place, FAU’s losing streak has now reached six games, and the Owls have fallen to 10th.",
    "fullText": "BOCA RATON — Florida Atlantic’s men’s basketball team continued its shocking free fall on Feb. 15. The Owls lost 83-81 in overtime to first-place South Florida in an American Conference state showdown.\n\nKanaan Carlyle, playing for the time since Feb. 1, missed a game-winning three-point attempt in the final seconds to seal the Owls’ (14-12, 6-7) fate.\n\nAfter starting out conference play 6-1 and sitting in first place, FAU’s losing streak has now reached six games, and the Owls have fallen to 10th in the razor-thin standings.\n\nMore college basketball: Florida basketball makes another statement in SEC race by dispatching Kentucky\n\nCarlyle scored 15 points on 5-for-13 shooting in his return. Devin Vanterpool led FAU with 26 points, and USF (18-8, 10-3) was led by Wes Enis with a game-high 27 points.\n\nAfter a disappointing loss to Rice on Feb. 11, the Owls were able to go toe-to-toe with the best team in the American, but couldn’t secure the victory.\n\n“I think we’re going to get hot,” FAU coach John Jakus said. “We’ll keep it going.”\n\nFAU will be back in action on Feb. 18 for a road matchup in San Antonio with the UTSA Roadrunners.\n\nHere are the takeaways from the latest loss:\n\nPerhaps the most notable change for the Owls was the return of starting point guard Kanaan Carlyle, who has been out for three of FAU’s last four games due to a calf injury.\n\nCarlyle looked healthy while knocking down 3 of his 8 three-pointers in 36 minutes of action. The junior had a chance to win it in the closing seconds of overtime, but came up just short from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Owls’ offense hummed much more soundly than it has in recent weeks. Five Owls — Carlyle, Vanterpool, Josiah Parker, Devin Williams and Isaiah Elohim — scored in double figures, but it wasn’t enough to take down the top team in the American.\n\nNonetheless, Jakus is confident that Carlyle’s return will make life easier heading into the final stretch of the regular season.\n\n“You can tell with Kanaan back, there’s a couple things that are pretty distinctive,” Jakus said. “There was just a flow of the way we play when they play together.”\n\nAmid a deflating losing streak, Jakus opted to make an adjustment to the team’s starting lineup by inserting Parker in place of the struggling Xander Pintelon.\n\nParker entered the matchup averaging 12.5 points and 7.5 rebounds per game against American Conference opponents and had been particularly exceptional of late, averaging 17.3 points and 9.0 rebounds per game in February.\n\nParker posted a 13-point, 10-rebound double-double to go along with two blocks. The performance was histhird-consecutive double-double, fifth of the season.\n\nHis upward trajectory has been arguably the only positive to come about during FAU’s losing skid, with Jakus acknowledging the time had come for Parker to start.\n\n“He’s the best freshman in the league,” Jakus said. “He’s averaging 17 and 10 over the last five games and we haven't won, so at a certain point I’m going to make a change in the starting lineup.\n\n“I liked bringing him off the bench. I thought there was a punch to that when we were 5-1. It was fun and cute to have him coming off the bench, but it’s not cute right now. We need guys to perform.”\n\nUSF’s Wes Enis and Joseph Pinion did their best “Splash Brothers” impression, knocking down a combined nine three-pointers. In the first half, it was Enis who got hot from downtown, scoring 18 of his 27 points while hitting four of his eight three-point tries.\n\nSouth Florida shot 36 percent from the floor, and 26 percent from three as a team, before halftime, but Enis’ shooting kept the game tight.\n\nIn the second half, it was Pinion’s turn to light up the Owls from beyond the arc. After scoring 4 points on 2-for-7 shooting from the floor and 0-for-3 from downtown in the first half, Pinion scored 12 points, hitting all four of his shots from three-point range in the latter half.\n\nIn a game in which USF made 13 of 39 layups, it was the marksmanship of Enis and Pinion that led to the Owls' demise. Both players hit numerous shots that were several feet beyond the three-point line, stretching FAU’s defense to the max as the Owls struggled to contain the long-range shooters.\n\n“Some of it is the actions, some of it is falling asleep for half a second, and then some of it is the fact that they can invert the floor all the way to the volleyball line,” Jakus said. “I think the very worst mistake you make is when you’re too low, and you let them see one go in. If you’re low, it’s over.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Beach Post: USF Bulls edge FAU Owls in overtime in American Conference basketball",

    "fullText": "Police chases are unpredictable by nature. But it’s rare to see a suspect attempt something usually reserved for trained law enforcement — and actually pull it off.\n\nThat’s exactly what unfolded during a high-speed pursuit involving the Florida Highway Patrol when a Chevy Silverado driver escalated a routine traffic stop into something far more dangerous.\n\nThe incident began when a trooper clocked the Silverado traveling 98 mph in a 70 mph zone. According to dashcam footage, the truck was also weaving through traffic at high speed. When the trooper activated lights and sirens, the driver didn’t slow down. Instead, he accelerated.\n\nThe pursuit quickly intensified. The Silverado continued swerving through traffic as the marked FHP Dodge Charger closed the gap. A second patrol vehicle soon joined the chase, boxing the suspect in from behind.\n\nThat’s when the situation took a dramatic turn.\n\nVideo shows the Silverado making aggressive lateral movements toward the pursuing cruiser, appearing to anticipate a PIT maneuver. In a sudden move, the truck sideswiped one patrol vehicle, damaging its push bar. Moments later, the driver steered sharply into the rear quarter panel of a pursuing Charger — executing a maneuver similar to the PIT tactic officers are trained to use.\n\nBut the Silverado paid a price.\n\nThe impact severely damaged the truck’s front end, and the passenger-side front wheel appeared to shear off during the chaos. Despite the damage, the driver continued fleeing, sparks visible beneath the truck as metal dragged along the pavement.\n\nDriving a crippled full-size pickup at highway speeds is a mechanical time bomb. A disabled axle, broken suspension components, or frame damage can quickly turn into a fire hazard — especially under sustained throttle.\n\nFortunately, another pursuing unit, reportedly in an unmarked Charger, successfully performed a controlled PIT maneuver that ended the chase before anyone was killed.\n\nAfter the suspect was taken into custody, authorities reportedly discovered empty liquor bottles and used marijuana products inside the truck. While toxicology results were not immediately available, impairment is suspected to have played a role.\n\nThe trooper who was spun out during the encounter survived without fatal injuries — a fact that feels almost miraculous considering the force involved. A vehicle used at high speed is not just transportation; it becomes a multi-thousand-pound weapon.\n\nThis wasn’t just reckless driving. It was a deliberate escalation of force on a public highway.\n\nThe incident underscores how quickly a routine traffic stop can spiral when speed, aggression, and possible intoxication collide. And while the suspect’s improvised PIT maneuver briefly flipped the script, it ultimately demonstrated the limits of physics — and judgment.\n\nNo matter how powerful the vehicle, momentum always wins in the end.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump made another careful descent of the Air Force One stairs Friday afternoon following his arrival in Palm Beach, Florida, this time clutching Melania’s hand all the way down.\n\nTrump, 79, disembarked with the first lady, and the two then climbed into the Beast, the armored presidential vehicle. Trump is spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, the de facto winter White House.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what plans—if any—the two had to mark Valentine’s Day; the White House did not respond to the Daily Beast’s question about that.\n\nAs for Trump’s health, spokesperson Davis Ingle sent a recycled statement: “President Trump is the sharpest, most accessible, and energetic president in American history. While the deranged and failing Daily Beast has their lightweight, glue-sniffing ‘reporters’ push baseless conspiracy theories—President Trump spent the day meeting with military families and putting the American people first.”\n\nSince taking office for the second time, Trump has been seen making many cautious descents of both Air Force One and Marine One, which is even less elevated.\n\nIn an interview earlier this month with former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who appears to have missed his life as a podcaster, Trump explained that his deliberate steps are to avoid tripping as Joe Biden did in 2021, when the then-president was 78 years old.\n\n“I’ve got to be very careful going in,” Trump said about walking up the stairs. “Ever noticed how slowly I am these days? Nice and slowly—I’m not looking to set any records. You don’t want to go down. Could happen, could happen. But it can’t happen three times in one shot, OK?”\n\nAnother factor at play is how Trump has been seen with swelling around his ankles. In 2025, the White House announced that the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition common in seniors, which makes it difficult for blood to return to the heart from the lower extremities.\n\nTrump takes aspirin—a higher than normal dosage—which acts as a blood thinner. This, combined with his frequent and vigorous handshaking, regularly causes bruising to the president’s hands, according to the White House.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Melania’s grip will have the same effect.",

    "description": "Here's everything Todd Golden said after Florida basketball beat the Kentucky Wildcats at home on Saturday.",
    "fullText": "Another game, another win for Florida basketball after beating the Kentucky Wildcats inside the O'Connell Center on Saturday afternoon, 92-83. That makes it five-straight victories for the Gators as the regular-season schedule begins to fade into March Madness.\n\nXaivian Lee led the charge as his late-season surge finally showed the promise he brought when he arrived via the transfer portal from Princeton, dropping a game-high 22 points along with three assists and two rebounds. Urban Klavžar added 19 as well to bolster a resurgent Florida backcourt.\n\nFollowing the Valentine's Day triumph, Todd Golden talked about his team's effort with the sports media. Here is what he had to say.\n\n\"Yeah, you know, really good college basketball game. I thought we did a really good job first half, getting off to a great start. I thought we kind of lost our edge a little bit in the middle of the first half.\n\n\"I heard you guys talking about the Rueben three, we kind of were lackadaisical with the ball in transition a little bit when I thought we could have maybe knocked them out. But credit to Kentucky, I thought they did a good job fighting, cutting that lead. They went on a 10-0 run on the heels of that, and nip and tuck a little bit early of the first 10 minutes of the second half.\n\n\"But I thought we did a really good job, relentless getting on the glass, you know, especially last 10 minutes of the game and making sure we got second-chance opportunities, making sure we got to the line. And our defense was great early, not great in the middle, but pretty good late guarding the line and making sure that we didn't give up any sort of run down the stretch.\n\n\"So, great win. I don't think we played our best, but we played well enough.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, he's playing great, right? I mean, he was fantastic at Georgia, he was great at Vanderbilt. He's stacked some really good games over the last couple of weeks, and I thought he was fantastic today. Just got off to a great start knocking shots down.\n\n\"To your point, he did a really good job of playing with great patience in the paint, playing off two, making good decisions. And he gave us a big lift. Obviously, him and Urby shooting the ball the way they did allowed us to win the game the way we did today.\"\n\n\"I thought Micah was great. I thought, you know, obviously the stat sheet doesn't tell the story minus the plus/minus. You know, it felt really good with him out there. He did a great job defensively, cleaned up on the glass.\n\n\"And obviously Rueben is, I would argue, the best defensive player in America, and Micah hasn't been any at that level clearly, but I thought today he did a great job of not allowing any fall-off when he was in the game, and that allowed us to play really well when he was in there and go plus-14.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, a big part of our scout was to make it tough on obviously Otega and 'Zel, and they went 12-for-35 combined from the field, one for nine from three. I thought we did a really good job of defending those guys.\n\n\"They were trying to score, and we knew that, and so we wanted to keep two on the ball when they were getting downhill, kind of force them into those play-making decisions. And overall, it was really good for us. And the things that hurt us were other things.\n\n\"Like, I thought we did a really poor job on Chandler, letting him get some space. I thought we did a poor job on Dioubate, letting him get left.\n\n\"So big-picture-wise, I thought scouting-wise we did a decent job in the main parts of what we were trying to accomplish, but the auxiliary stuff really bothered us and it allowed Kentucky to stay in the game.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, I think he's, as I've told you guys, he's a great player. People want to poke at things about our team or about our personnel when we're not doing everything perfectly, but you look at the big picture, and how many guys in America would you trade Alex Condon for?\n\n\"I can't think of any at that spot. And he's been a huge winner for us. And the double-double, huge, but it's his defense, it's his winning plays, it's his effort that's unmatched, and it's why he's such a great player.\"\n\n\"I mean, we lost our first year here when we were a little banged up. They got us in a great game when they had Sheppard and Rob Dillingham. We led most of the game and they won it late. Aaron Bradshaw hit a big three. That was interesting. And then this was the next time we got them in here and we took care of business.\n\n\"Obviously, won there two years ago. So, you know, it is what it is, and just the way the schedule shaped up, and now we're gonna have a really tough challenge going back to Rupp.\n\n\"Obviously, Kentucky is playing a lot better. There's no doubt about that. I stick by what I said, their ability and the fact that they have some guys out and the rotation has shrunk has allowed people to get comfortable in their roles, and they're playing a lot better for it.\n\n\"So, there's a reason why they were able to climb into second after a tough starting league play. So they're playing some good ball. They're talented.\n\n\"Obviously, a $22 million roster. They're physical, they're big and I expect them to do well the rest of the year. They're a really good team.\"\n\n\"Listen, our crowd is incredible. And we had to earn it when we got the job here in terms of getting kind of the excitement back in the O'Dome. But as I said before, this is why it's a great place. People really appreciate winning, and they want to be a part of it. They want to be around it.\n\n\"And when we've given them a semblance of hope about our program, they've shown up for us and supported us in a big way. And today was no different. It was a great crowd, great atmosphere. There's a reason why college basketball is what it is right now.\n\n\"It's games like this on ABC that make it special. And this was a great game.\"\n\n\"We're trending. I don't necessarily have a goal of where we want to be at a certain point. We just want to get better, and we've definitely done that over the course of conference play. We've improved in a lot of different ways. Our bench has really stepped up and given us the ability to play eight and be complete that way. And we've been pretty consistent.\n\n\"Obviously, we didn't play well against Auburn in here, and that one will sting us a little bit, but we haven't lost since that game. And besides Missouri, in a game where I didn't think we played great, and they're improving. They're a very good team. They won on the road at Kentucky. They won on the road at Texas A&M earlier in the week.\n\n\"So, you know, they're starting to hit their stride, but we're getting there. We're not all the way. I thought today we took a step back in some of the areas that we had been growing in, but we're also getting a lot better in some areas that I didn't expect us to maybe jump in.\n\n\"It means everything to me, to be honest. The love that we have for those guys is immeasurable. I think they changed a lot of people's lives during their time here in Gainesville. And they're great dudes. They're a great representation of our program, and obviously led us to a national championship.\n\n\"And a lot of guys want to go to the Bahamas, or they want to go to Cabo or Miami, and the fact that these guys came to be with us. They were here yesterday in practice; they sat in with us during film. They were here at shootaround today.\n\n\"Obviously, they got a well-deserved moment of recognition sitting there courtside. And it's just incredible, man. Nobody can ever take away from us what we did together, and I anticipate that relationship with the university being strong for a long time.\"\n\n\"I'm never going to say that a loss benefits us in that sense, but I will say that we responded the right way from it. You have to tip your crap. I thougth Auburn played really well. We didn't have our best that day. It can happen.\n\n\"This league's really good. There's a lot of really talented teams. What we've been able to do ... I think is pretty incredible. We're winning most every game by double digits. We're doing it comfortably. We're guarding at an elite level. I think our offense and defense have been top five nationally over the last 10 games, so we are turning into a complete team.\n\n\"We knew this was going to take a little bit of time. We played a tough schedule, lost a little confidence. We were trying to shape through all that, but it's mid-February and we're playing some good ball. As we have talked about, and will continue to talk about I don't think we are at our peak yet.\n\n\"I think we have areas that we can still improve, but we're headed in the right direction.\n\n\"I thought we did a great job on him. I thought he'd get some tough shows. The one I was disappointed with was the with three we gave up in the first half on the ball screen where our help wasn't high enough. We understand that for this team, Otega and Aberdeen are going to try and make all of the points.\n\n\"We got to do a good job of running Chandler off the line, which we didn't. But if we could cut their waiter off and that we would give ourselves a good chance to win. They're both really good players and you're not going to make them miss every time.\n\n\"But you know to go combined 12 of 35, that's winning basketball for sure.\"\n\n\"It means a lot because you're in position. It means first of all that you are playing well, and you're trying to win a league. But it doesn't change how we approach anything we do. We're not going to talk about holding onto first place leading up to the South Carolina game. It really has nothing to do with that.\n\n\"I do think, to talk about the Auburn game, that might have been a little bit of our issue that day. We were talking about getting back in position to win the league, look too far forward. This team has been at its best when we've living in the now, and focusing on getting better every day, and not worrying about anything other than the next game.\"\n\n\"Well, I think Kentucky has been rebounding the ball better. Tennessee got them on the glass but if you look at their last five or so matchups, they've been getting close to 30% of their misses back or more.\n\n\"They are playing much bigger than they were earlier. I think its kind of a result of that. Rebounding was a big part of the scout. It was a concern of ours to make sure we kept them off the glass. They got us early. They weren't making shots. They were getting their second chances.\n\n\"We weren't putting any pressure on the offensive glass. I think we were even at halftime on the glass, but I thought they won the boards. They won the battle of the boards in the first half, but we did a much better job. Our tenaciousness, our physicality, showed up in the last 10 minutes of the game.\n\n\"I thought we dominated that way. We kind of refused to not get the ball. That has to be our calling card as we move forward.\"\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida basketball postgame quotes from Todd golden after Kentucky win",

    "title": "So long, New York: Why Bethenny Frankel says Miami is the 'new LA'",
    "description": "The \"Real Housewives of New York City\" star and entrepreneur, Bethenny Frankel, is among wealthy Americans to move to Florida from cultural hubs like New York City and LA.",
    "fullText": "The former \"Real Housewives of New York City\" star Bethenny Frankel built her public persona in the Big Apple, but after moving to Florida in 2025, she says the Sunshine State is the new cultural hub for America's rich and famous.\n\n\"Miami is the new LA,\" Frankel, 55, told Business Insider. \"In the way that LA was the cool place to be, and aspirational people wanted to be there.\"\n\nLast March, the reality TV veteran, entrepreneur, and social media influencer joined a wave of New Yorkers relocating to South Florida, settling on the coast with her teenage daughter.\n\nShe's one of many Americans leaving cultural hubs like New York and Los Angeles for smaller cities in the Sun Belt. A January 2026 Bank of America Institute study on US migration found that New York recorded the second-largest population loss of any US city in the fourth quarter of 2025, after Los Angeles. About 45% of outbound New Yorkers headed southward, with Miami alone accounting for 7% of departures.\n\n\"It's also cool to be in New York,\" Frankel said, \"but not as much as being in Miami, and Florida in general.\"\n\nAmong the Florida arrivals is a number of billionaires. Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Glenview Capital Management's CEO, Larry Robbins, have all relocated from northern cities to Florida's warmer shores in the past four years.\n\n\"Rich people are moving down here,\" said Frankel, who runs the private membership dating community The Core. \"Miami's exploded, real-estate-wise.\"\n\nData backs that up. Realtor.com's December 2025 Luxury Housing Report found that the Miami metro area had the highest number of million-dollar listings in the country, snatching a title that had traditionally been held by New York. More than a quarter of demand in the Miami metro region originated from the New York metro area, the report found.\n\nFrankel said the influx of new wealth has changed Miami's cultural landscape. \"It means shopping, art, nightlife, the real-estate cool factor,\" she said. \"Everybody went where the money is. The money is dictating what's happening on social media, and what's happening that's cool.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Lucia Moses reported in December that Miami is emerging as a hub for social media influencers. It had the highest number of top Instagram creators per capita of any US city, ahead of New York and LA.\n\nFlorida's draw in recent years, however, has extended beyond just billionaires and social-media influencers. Business Insider previously reported that differences in tax policy and cost of living meant that someone earning $150,000 a year could save roughly $50,000 annually by moving from New York City to Miami, largely due to Florida's lack of state income tax.\n\nFor Frankel, the move offered more than that. She said it has made her \"more social\" and allowed her to run her businesses from the \"sunniest and most beautiful-weathered place.\"\n\nWhile Florida has drawn in large numbers of domestic migrants since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Miami has begun to hemorrhage residents. The Bank of America Institute study found that Miami recorded the third-largest domestic population decline among US cities in the fourth quarter of 2025, with many residents relocating to more affordable parts of Florida, including Orlando and Tampa.\n\nIn Frankel's views, the whole state is having a moment. \"Delray, Palm Beach, Boca, Miami, the Design District,\" she said. \"Florida is on fire.\"",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A former high-ranking official in the New York Police Department has been charged with accepting $35,000 in cash, luxury travel perks and other bribes from a Florida businessman seeking to sell panic buttons to the city’s public schools and police.\n\nIn an indictment Thursday, federal prosecutors said Kevin Taylor attempted to steer an $11 million contract toward the company, SaferWatch, while serving as the commanding officer of the NYPD’s School Safety Division. The company markets its product as a “mobile panic alert system” used for mass shootings and other emergencies.\n\nIn exchange, the company’s founder, Gene Roefaro, showered Taylor and his romantic partner with gifts — including luxury hotels and airfare to the Bahamas and Las Vegas, helicopter tours, tickets to Broadway musicals and a “medieval-themed dinner theater” — along with multiple cash payments, prosecutors said.\n\nTaylor pleaded not guilty to bribery and wire fraud charges on Thursday. An emailed inquiry to his attorney was not returned.\n\nRoefaro is also facing charges, including bribery and wire fraud. He has not yet entered a plea. An attorney for Roefaro said it was “puzzling and deeply concerning that the United States Attorney’s Office has chosen to pursue charges against Geno, while at the very same time, alleging — and seeking to prove — that he was the victim of an extortionate shakedown.\"\n\nThe charges are the latest allegations of corruption and favor-trading lodged against officials appointed by the city’s former mayor, Eric Adams, who faced his own indictment in a separate bribery scheme that also involved luxury travel gifts.\n\nWhile the case against Adams was later abandoned by the Trump administration, at least some of the probes into his inner circle remain active, including an ongoing bribery case involving his former chief advisor. In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have announced bribery charges against two other NYPD officers and a former housing official under Adams.\n\nThe investigation into SaferWatch first emerged in September 2024 as part of a sprawling federal probe into the Adams administration. The company was one of several to hire a consulting firm run by the brother of two top Adams officials, both of whom resigned after their homes were searched by federal authorities.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege that in 2023 Taylor helped secured a no-bid contract to pilot Roefaro’s products within the command center of the NYPD’s school safety division. But as the police official struggled to expand the program, Roefaro grew frustrated, at times describing himself as a “sugar daddy” who had “made a MAJOR investment and zero return,” according to the indictment.\n\n“It’s been fun, but it’s not fun or funny anymore,” Roefaro allegedly texted Taylor in late 2023. “Our company (ME) needs to report something real and significant that is in place prior to end of year.”\n\nDays later, Taylor tried to put together a press conference to announce his division would be procuring a tip line from Roefaro's company, prosecutors said. But that event was later cancelled.\n\nDuring roughly the same time, Taylor was also attempting to solicit $75,000 in bribes from two businessmen involved in a company that sold bullet-resistant vests to police, according to the indictment. Both men declined his solicitations, prosecutors said.",

    "description": "As a ULA Vulcan bolted into the early Thursday skies over Cape Canaveral, many witnessed a solid rocket booster issue.",
    "fullText": "A sustained rumble shook the Space Coast early Feb. 12 as a United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket took to the sky above Cape Canaveral but what many noticed was the unexpected light show coming from the rocket.\n\nAfter an initial delay, the Vulcan bolted into the sky at 4:22 a.m. Thursday from Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Shortly after liftoff, sparks appeared briefly from the area of the solid rocket boosters.\n\nThe rocket zoomed upward and east under the power of two core BE-4 engines and four side mounted solid rocket boosters. Then just two and a half minutes into the flight, those four solid engines detached from the rocket's core stage, appearing as four little points of light falling away from the rocket.\n\nFLORIDA TODAY photographers observed a flash and sparks coming from the rocket shortly into flight. United Launch Alliance said there was \"an observation\" its team was studying, but it had no impact on the mission being deployed correctly into orbit.\n\n\"We had an observation early during flight on one of the four solid rocket motors, the team is currently reviewing the data. The booster, upper stage, and spacecraft continued to perform on a nominal trajectory,\" a Feb. 12 update from United Launch Alliance read.\n\nVulcan had experienced a solid rocket booster mishap before. On its Oct. 2024 test flight, the Vulcan experienced an issue inside the nozzle on the booster, with many witnessing a brief spark coming from the side of the rocket. That payload made it to orbit on that flight without any problems, as well.\n\n“The integrated U.S. government and contractor team is reviewing the technical data, available imagery, and establishing a recovery team to collect any debris. We will conduct a thorough investigation, identify root cause, and implement any corrective action necessary before the next Vulcan mission,\" Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of Atlas and Vulcan Programs said in an update to the media.\n\nKnown as USSF-87, the Feb. 12 mission was called a Space Force “neighborhood watch” over geostationary orbit, which are satellites orbiting at the same direction and speed as the Earth.\n\nUSSF-87 is a Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) spacecraft developed by Northrop Grumman, which is designed to boost the Space Force’s ability to quickly spot, assess, and attribute disruptions impacting geosynchronous orbit spacecraft. This includes identifying the potential threat of satellite collisions.\n\nULA said this spacecraft was the heaviest Vulcan payload flown to date. It was estimated that it was going to take approximately 10 hours to deliver the payload to its destination following launch.\n\nWhen is the next Florida launch? Is there a launch today? Upcoming NASA, SpaceX, ULA launch schedule in Florida\n\nDuring a Feb. 10 press briefing, company officials said they are expecting an increase in launch cadence this year. While ULA launched a total of six times last year — five Atlas V rockets and one Vulcan — the company plans more launches from the Cape, as well as a debut Vulcan launch from California. These missions will range from national security to Amazon Leo internet satellites.\n\n“We’re well positioned for the future,” said interim CEO John Elbon.\n\nElbon has served as interim CEO since Tory Bruno’s departure from the company in Dec. 2025 to head Blue Origin’s National Security program. Elbon had a previous career at partner Boeing and has currently been with ULA for eight years.\n\nThe next ULA mission is not currently on the Cape launch schedule, but it is anticipated to be the launch of a batch of Amazon Leo (formerly known as Project Kuiper) internet satellites atop another Vulcan rocket.\n\nThe next launch from Cape Canaveral could take place as soon as 5:15 a.m. Friday, Feb. 13 from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. SpaceX is poised to launch NASA's next astronaut crew, referred to as Crew-12, to the International Space Station atop a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nThe launch was originally set to occur earlier in the week, but was delayed due to weather along the northern flight path, which must be clear in case of an abort. While weather is expected to be low risk at the launch pad, ascent path weather is still forecasted to be moderate on Feb. 13. The conditions along the ascent path and Cape are forecasted to deteriorate over the next 72 hours, according to the Space Force 45th Weather Squadron.\n\nThe FLORIDA TODAY Space Team will bring you the latest updates at FloridaToday.com/Space.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

    "fullText": "Some parts of the US might still be in the peak of winter, but down in the sunnier states, people are already bringing out their bathing suits.\n\nAs a Florida local of nearly a decade, some of my favorite days are the ones when I slow down, bask in the sun, and breathe in fresh air while tubing down a crystal-clear spring, surrounded by the peaceful sounds of nature.\n\nUnlike the rowdy tourist beach towns or overcrowded theme parks, this is the Florida I've come to know and love.\n\nAway from tourist hot spots such as Disney World or Miami Beach, Florida offers hidden gems for all tastes, whether you're more nature-inclined or want to explore towns that will make you feel like you're in Europe.\n\nAfter living in the state for nearly a decade, I found that the best travel destinations in the state are far from the most famous.\n\nWhether you're escaping from cold weather or planning a summer trip to Florida, here are seven towns you should visit.\n\nWhen picturing a Florida beach vacation, you might think of Miami Beach or maybe Clearwater Beach if you're aiming for the Gulf Coast. If you're looking to avoid tourists, however, I recommend visiting the beaches near Jacksonville.\n\nThe North Florida shores in Ponte Vedra are mostly lined with single-family houses along the A1A road and can be far from downtown areas, making it the perfect escape if you're looking to relax rather than party.\n\nMany of these houses, which are often winter homes for their owners, can be rented as Airbnbs, making them ideal for family or group vacations.\n\nThe Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve, a 73,000-acre stretch of wild nature, is also the perfect spot to hike and kayak saltwater marshes while exploring Florida's wildlife.\n\nThe oldest town in the US, St. Augustine, was founded in 1565 by Spanish settlers. Today, the city offers a picturesque destination for those looking for history and charm.\n\nWhether you're enjoying its nearby beaches or immersing yourself in medieval Spanish culture in the city's historic district, St. Augustine offers a wide range of activities for families and history enthusiasts.\n\nDuring your time here, make sure to tour the Castillo de San Marcos National Monument, the oldest fort in the US, and walk along the cobblestoned streets of the historic downtown, like St. George Street, which features a 1716 schoolhouse and dozens of restaurants and boutiques.\n\nEvery holiday season, from November to January, the historic district is illuminated for the city's \"Nights of Lights\" showcase. Walking through it feels like strolling through a Christmas postcard, only with palm trees and Spanish castles instead of snow.\n\nOriginally settled in the 1840s, this tiny community in Florida's Nature Coast — the stretch of the Gulf Coast between Tampa and Pensacola — may not be on your travel radar, but if you enjoy fresh seafood and less crowded areas, it should be.\n\nCedar Key is a small island located about a 2 1/2-hour drive from Orlando and is one of the largest producers of farm-raised clams in the country. You can enjoy fresh, delicious seafood while sitting on the shore of Florida's undiscovered coast.\n\nThe quiet town is often compared to the more touristy Key West, which was Jimmy Buffett's home and inspiration. In Cedar Key, you can also enjoy some of the signature Key West attractions — such as key lime pies and small local boutiques — without dealing with the crowds.\n\nAs a foodie myself, I can only tell you how amazing the seafood in Cedar Key is. The rest you will have to experience for yourself.\n\nIf you're more of a nature person, head over to Ocala to enjoy clear freshwater springs and Florida forests.\n\nThe springs near Ocala are amazing for kayaking or just for taking a dip. While kayaking in the river streams, you might spot some alligators, manatees, and even monkeys.\n\nAdditionally, the area is home to one of America's only elephant rescue farms, Two Tails Ranch, and the longest ziplines in the state at the Canyons Zip Line and Adventure Park.\n\nSome of the best beaches in Florida — and the world — are in Sarasota.\n\nSiesta Key, which has been named as the best beach in the US and fourth best in the world, is a pristine white-sand, turquoise-water beach perfect for families or for relaxing.\n\nThe city also offers a variety of art sightseeing, such as Ca' d'Zan, the Mediterranean-inspired mansion at the Ringling Museum.\n\nIf you're driving from Tampa, prepare to cross the tallest bridge in the state, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. At its peak height, I felt like I was flying on an airplane looking down.\n\nNear the space-themed attractions at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral is Cocoa Village, a small historic downtown filled with local vendors and plenty of art.\n\nThe small coastal town also has a variety of food spots for every occasion, including an English tavern, a French bistro, and a fully vegan New American restaurant.\n\nAnd if you're looking for a unique experience, you can kayak or paddle the bioluminescent waters of the Indian River Lagoon — you might see a few dolphins, too.\n\nIf you're making your way down the Florida Keys, you may as well stop to visit a couple of its gorgeous beaches.\n\nWhile Key West deserves the hype it receives as a travel destination, some of the other spots in the Florida Keys are often overlooked.\n\nSouth of Marathon Key and north of Key West is Sombrero Beach, one of the most underrated beaches in the US. On this white-sand beach, you can enjoy some of the calmest waters in Florida, perfect for families or for relaxing.\n\nIt's also a turtle-nesting spot, so you might even see a few loggerhead turtles during nesting season.\n\nFor a fun historical sight, head a few minutes down the Overseas Highway, and you'll see some of the remnants of the once-active Overseas Railroad in Bahia Honda Key.",

    "fullText": "STARKE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of killing a traveling salesman he and his brother had met at a bar has become the first person executed in Florida this year.\n\nRonald Palmer Heath, 64, was pronounced dead at 6:12 p.m. Tuesday following a three-drug injection at Florida State Prison near Starke. Heath was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery with a deadly weapon and other charges in the 1989 killing of Michael Sheridan.\n\nWhen the curtain to the execution chamber went up at the scheduled 6 p.m. start time, Heath was already strapped down with an IV inserted in his arm. Asked by the warden if Heath had any final statement, he said, ”I’m sorry. That’s all I can say. Thank you.”\n\nAs the drugs were being administered, Heath showed little outward reaction, closing his eyes and then appearing to fall asleep before becoming motionless. A medic was called in about 8 minutes after the drugs began, and Heath was declared dead 2 minutes after that.\n\nIt was the state’s first execution of 2026 and followed a record 19 executions in Florida last year. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis oversaw more executions in a single year in 2025 than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in the U.S. in 1976. The previous Florida record was eight executions set in 2014.\n\nAccording to court records, Heath and his brother Kenneth Heath met Sheridan at a Gainesville bar in May 1989. After hanging out at the bar for some time, the three men agreed to go somewhere else to smoke marijuana.\n\nAt some point, the brothers plotted to rob the other man, investigators said. Ronald Heath drove the group to a remote area, where Kenneth Heath pulled a handgun on Sheridan. The man initially refused to give the brothers anything, and Kenneth Heath shot Sheridan in the chest.\n\nAs Sheridan emptied his pockets, Ronald Heath began kicking the man and stabbing him with a hunting knife, prosecutors said. Kenneth Heath then shot Sheridan twice in the head.\n\nThe brothers dumped Sheridan's body in a wooded area and returned to the Gainesville bar to take items from his rental car, according to the court record. It said the brothers made multiple purchases with Sheridan's credit cards the next day at a Gainesville mall.\n\nRonald Heath was arrested several weeks later at his home in Douglas, Georgia, after investigators connected him to the stolen credit cards. Officers recovered clothing purchased with the stolen cards, as well as Sheridan's watch, according to court records.\n\nKenneth Heath was also charged with Sheridan's murder, but was sentenced to life in prison as part of a plea agreement.\n\nMore than a dozen family members of victims of Heath's crimes witnessed his execution.\n\nWhen Heath was 16, he was convicted of killing teenager Michael Green, and served 10 years in prison.\n\nDays after Sheridan's death, authorities also found the body of Tony Hammett. Heath was charged with Hammett's killing, but the case never went to trial.\n\nSheridan's brother, Thomas Sheridan, said during a news conference following the execution that his family, as well as the families of Green and Hammett, had been waiting for this day for more than three decades.\n\n“Tonight, Ronald Palmer Heath was released to the custody of his new parole officer. As far as I’m concerned, any forgiveness is between him and God,\" Thomas Sheridan said.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court denied appeals filed by Ronald Heath last week. His attorneys had argued that Florida corrections officials had mismanaged its own death penalty protocols, that the state's secretive clemency process blocked due process, that Heath's incarceration as a juvenile stunted his brain development and that jurors did not recommend the death penalty unanimously.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Heath's appeal.\n\nA total of 47 people were executed in the U.S. in 2025. Florida led the way with a flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis. Alabama, South Carolina and Texas tied for second with five executions each that year.\n\nTwo more Florida executions have already been scheduled for later this month and next month. Melvin Trotter, 65, is scheduled to die on Feb. 24, and the execution of Billy Leon Kearse, 53, is set to follow exactly a week later on March 3.\n\nAll Florida executions are carried out via lethal injection using a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the Department of Corrections.",

    "fullText": "Florida State softball added a win against Liberty to their record, as they took down the Flames in a late effort to secure a run 8-0 run rule.\n\nNewly crowned ACC Pitcher of the Week, Jazzy Francik got her third start of the week. Francik worked around a leadoff walk, keeping Liberty off the board.\n\nIn the bottom of the inning, the Seminoles saw Gabby Mike in the circle. Early, Isa Torres had the defense scrambling on a soft hit single on the infield. Mike added Jaysoni Beachum on base by hit by pitch, however, the Liberty defense put up a 0 in the first inning.\n\nAfter a 3 up, 3 down inning from Francik, the Seminoles bats looked to push across their first run. A hard hit single from Marin Heller, walk to Beachum, and Shelby McKenzie single mishandled by the defense had ‘Noles at every bag.\n\nMike rolled a pair of ground balls, keeping the bases loaded, but putting two outs on the board. Now with Hayley Griggs at the plate, the freshman drew a walk to break the scoreless tie.\n\nAfter causing through the first three innings, Francik saw traffic in the 4th. A walk, followed by a single up the middle had Liberty threatening with no outs. A comebacker to the circle, followed by a ground ball to third, which turned into a double play by Beachum got FSU out of the inning unscathed.\n\nFIRE US UP DEFENSE🔥🔥🔥\n\nBack-to-back clutch plays to get us out of the inning‼️\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/ZfaXNotHDk\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 11, 2026\n\nMarlee Gaskell took over for Francik, looking to hold her teams 1-0 lead. Gaskell had help from a clutch defensive play, got herself a strikeout before giving up a single. Luckily, the single did no damage, and Gaskell got out of the inning scoreless.\n\nJaysoni. Beachum. That's all 😱\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 | @NCAASoftball pic.twitter.com/gahp5UDtoH\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 11, 2026\n\nA one out single from Ashtyn Danley got the ‘Noles first baserunner on of the inning. Liberty went to the bullpen, after Danley’s hit took Mike out of the circle. Out of the bullpen, it was Caitlyn Nesbitt to face the rest of the FSU lineup.\n\nFor her first batter, Nesbitt walked Anna Hinde with one out. A single into the outfield from Griggs scored one, and a single from Makenna Sturgis got another run in. The Liberty defense had trouble with the ball, leading to the fourth run of the game.\n\nTHESE FRESHMEN‼️‼️‼️\n\nHayley and Makenna with back-to-back singles to make it 4-0🍢🍢\n\n📺ACCNX pic.twitter.com/VGLSE6FOox\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 11, 2026\n\nAn error, leading to a walk, put runners in scoring position with two outs. Heller’s third hit of the day knocked in two more runs, making it 6-0 for FSU.\n\nHAVE A NIGHT MARIN‼️‼️‼️\n\nShe picks up her third hit of the night to make it 6-0 Noles🍢\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/AaniEnZHxY\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 11, 2026\n\nBella Dimitrijevic became the third Seminole pitcher in the 6th, taking over for Gaskell. The freshman sat down the minimum, leading her team to a possible run rule.\n\nLeading off in the bottom of the inning, McKenzie faced a new pitcher, greeting her with a leadoff moonshot.\n\nSHELBY LAUNCHES ONE‼️‼️\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/6Prf0pnR6q\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 11, 2026\n\nDanley kept things going with a single. Angelee Bueno batted for the first time, after becoming the first baseman earlier in the game. On a 3-1 count, Bueno drove a ball into the outfield, scoring Danley and walking off the run rule win.\n\nFSU will head to the Shriner’s Children’s Clearwater Invitational, where they will face Texas Tech, FAU, UCLA and Tennessee",

Representatives for Zuckerberg at Meta declined to comment to Business Insider.\n\nOver the years, Zuckerberg has bought and sold homes all over the country. He's also reportedly built some — a Hawaiian doomsday ranch that has had many scratching their heads, for example.\n\nHere's what we know about his real estate portfolio.\n\nIt's no surprise that a tech titan has more than one property in Silicon Valley. The Meta CEO owns five homes in the Crescent Park neighborhood of Palo Alto.\n\nHe gave viewers a rare peek inside one of them in 2016; the house is even tricked out with a \"custom-made artificially intelligent assistant,\" according to CNBC. The home is only a 10-minute drive from the Meta HQ in Menlo Park.\n\nArchitectural Digest described it as a \"'no frills abode\" that chooses function over extravagance. Zuckerberg then spent over $43 million on the four homes surrounding his original residence in Crescent Park, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom home is located near San Francisco's Dolores Park. He and his wife, Priscilla Chan, reportedly spent $10 million to purchase the townhouse in 2010.\n\nAt the time of the sale in 2022, it was the largest residential real estate deal in the city.\n\nLake Tahoe is a popular vacation destination for wealthy Californians in both summer and winter, and Zuckerberg and his family are no exception.\n\nThe tax records of the two properties — known as Carousel Estate and Brushwood Estate — display the same address as tax records of other properties linked to Zuckerberg, according to documents viewed by BI.\n\nAt 5,322 square feet, the Brushwood Estate features six bedrooms, five baths, and two half baths, according to SF Gate. Inside are high-beamed ceilings and picture windows; outside are lush trees, a private dock, and a hot tub. There's also a 2,293-square-foot guesthouse.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how many acres of land Zuckerberg currently owns on Kauai, but he began buying up a region of the island back in 2014.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked down at least 1,200 acres between 17 parcels of land that have the same tax address as other properties mentioned above, but are owned by LLCs including Kahu'aina Holdings LLC and Pila'a International LLC.\n\nThe 1,200 acres include about 750 acres he reportedly paid $100 million in 2014 for. That encompasses a more than 350-acre span of land on Pila'a Beach.\n\nAnother part of Zuckerberg's Hawaii holdings is the nearly 600 acres of land on Kauai's North Shore that reportedly cost him around $53 million in 2021.\n\nOn one of his Hawaiian parcels, Zuckerberg is reportedly building a huge compound that's said to include a 5,000-square-foot underground bunker with an escape hatch. It's been dubbed Koolau Ranch, and Wired reported that buying the land and creating the compound cost the executive an estimated $270 million.\n\nAs Silicon Valley continues to infiltrate Washington, DC, Zuckerberg established a residence in the US capital, Politico said. The home that's reportedly his new pad is situated in Massachusetts Avenue Heights, not far from the Naval Observatory and the Washington National Cathedral, according to Builder magazine.\n\nZuckerberg kept the purchase private, Politico said. The mansion in question was sold for $23 million in cash. It was designed by local firm Robert Gurney Architect and sits on about one acre of property.\n\nBusiness Insider was unable to independently confirm that Zuckerberg purchased the property.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is reportedly adding a second East Coast property to his portfolio after buying a home in Miami, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nZuckerberg is purchasing a waterfront mansion on Indian Creek, an exclusive island in South Florida that's home to Jeff Bezos, Carl Icahn, and Jared Kushner.\n\nThe sold home previously belonged to a limited liability company linked to Peter Cancro, the founder of Jersey Mike's Subs. The property — which was just a home lot — was last traded for $37 million in 2021, Miami-Dade property records show.\n\nIt's unclear how much this off-market deal was worth, but an empty lot next door to Bezos sold for $105 million in 2025.\n\nHillary Hoffower contributed to an earlier version of this story.",

He and his wife, Priscilla Chan, reportedly spent $10 million to purchase the townhouse in 2010.\n\nAt the time of the sale in 2022, it was the largest residential real estate deal in the city.\n\nHe bought two adjacent estates on the shore of Lake Tahoe around 2019.\n\nLake Tahoe is a popular vacation destination for wealthy Californians in both summer and winter, and Zuckerberg and his family are no exception.\n\nThe tax records of the two properties — known as Carousel Estate and Brushwood Estate — display the same address as tax records of other properties linked to Zuckerberg, according to documents viewed by BI.\n\nZuckerberg reportedly paid $59 million for both properties.\n\nAt 5,322 square feet, the Brushwood Estate features six bedrooms, five baths, and two half baths, according to SF Gate. Inside are high-beamed ceilings and picture windows; outside are lush trees, a private dock, and a hot tub. There's also a 2,293-square-foot guesthouse.\n\nThe Meta exec owns over 1,200 acres of land in Hawaii.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how many acres of land Zuckerberg currently owns on Kauai, but he began buying up a region of the island back in 2014.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked down at least 1,200 acres between 17 parcels of land that have the same tax address as other properties mentioned above, but are owned by LLCs including Kahu'aina Holdings LLC and Pila'a International LLC.\n\nThe 1,200 acres include about 750 acres he reportedly paid $100 million in 2014 for. That encompasses a more than 350-acre span of land on Pila'a Beach.\n\nHis plans for Koolau Ranch seem to be in preparation for the worst case scenario.\n\nAnother part of Zuckerberg's Hawaii holdings is the nearly 600 acres of land on Kauai's North Shore that reportedly cost him around $53 million in 2021.\n\nOn one of his Hawaiian parcels, Zuckerberg is reportedly building a huge compound that's said to include a 5,000-square-foot underground bunker with an escape hatch. It's been dubbed Koolau Ranch, and Wired reported that buying the land and creating the compound cost the executive an estimated $270 million.\n\nIn March 2025, he purchased a 15,000-square-foot mansion in Washington, DC.\n\nAs Silicon Valley continues to infiltrate Washington, DC, Zuckerberg established a residence in the US capital, Politico said. The home that's reportedly his new pad is situated in Massachusetts Avenue Heights, not far from the Naval Observatory and the Washington National Cathedral, according to Builder magazine.\n\nZuckerberg kept the purchase private, Politico said. The mansion in question was sold for $23 million in cash. It was designed by local firm Robert Gurney Architect and sits on about one acre of property.\n\nBusiness Insider was unable to independently confirm that Zuckerberg purchased the property.\n\nZuckerberg is also moving down the street from Jeff Bezos after reportedly buying property in Miami.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is reportedly adding a second East Coast property to his portfolio after buying a home in Miami, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nZuckerberg is purchasing a waterfront mansion on Indian Creek, an exclusive island in South Florida that's home to Jeff Bezos, Carl Icahn, and Jared Kushner.\n\nThe sold home previously belonged to a limited liability company linked to Peter Cancro, the founder of Jersey Mike's Subs. The property — which was just a home lot — was last traded for $37 million in 2021, Miami-Dade property records show.\n\nIt's unclear how much this off-market deal was worth, but an empty lot next door to Bezos sold for $105 million in 2025.\n\nHillary Hoffower contributed to an earlier version of this story.",

    "fullText": "Steve Spurrier has a message for Clemson football coach Dabo Swinney.\n\nThe \"Head Ball Coach\" was asked about by a reporter on Monday about Swinney publicly calling out Ole Miss coach Pete Golding and Rebels general manager Austin Thomas for tampering with linebacker Luke Ferrelli, who enrolled at Clemson and was in team meetings before joining Mississippi.\n\n\"I thought by now somebody would have told Dabo: 'Dabo, there ain't no rules anymore,'\" Spurrier said with a laugh in response to a question from WYFF-TV's Marc Whiteman.\n\n\"There are (rules) still on the books I guess back there about, 'You can't do it after this date or that date.' Gosh, (in) basketball, they got pros coming back to play in college there, so I don't know. I don't know if they're ever going to enforce any rules now or not.\"\n\n\"But I think Dabo has learned now that he's got to start paying his players just like everybody else is, or you'll get left behind... You can complain, but I don't know how good it's going to do.\"\n\n\"There's no rules. Somebody tell Dabo there's no rules now,\" Spurrier repeated.\n\nSteve Spurrier talked to reporters today on a Zoom ahead of his induction into the SC Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was asked by ⁦@MarcWYFFNews4⁩ about Dabo Swinney’s calling out of Ole Miss for tampering.\n\nSpurrier says “Someone has to tell Dabo there are no rules now.” pic.twitter.com/qLifbBNcqe\n\n— Jon Blau (@Jon_Blau) February 9, 2026\n\nSpurrier is the latest prominent figure to weigh in on the tampering saga, which Swinney highlighted in rigorous detail at a news conference on Jan. 23.\n\nDuring the news conference, Swinney said that he had turned Ole Miss into the NCAA for \"blatant tampering.\"\n\n\"I've always just stayed in my lane and handled my business, and I've stayed focused on Clemson,\" Swinney said at the time. \"But I'm not going to let someone just flat out tamper with my program. If you tamper with my players, I'm going to turn you in.\"\n\nSeveral prominent college football voices have come to Swinney's defense, including Fox Sports top game analyst Joel Klatt.\n\n\"Dabo is absolutely right,\" Klatt said recently. “He's right, and yet we need more guys like Dabo to step forward and say: 'govern us.'\"\n\n“The reality of the situation is, something has to put a stop to this,\" added ESPN's Tom Luginbill. \"Because this is the problem. It’s not name, image and likeness. It’s not the transfer portal. It’s tampering.\"\n\nFormer coach Urban Meyer, whose Ohio State teams met Clemson in the College Football Playoff and the Orange Bowl, also came to Swinney's defense. Meyer said Swinney did the right thing by turning in Ole Miss.\n\n\"I actually see people out there taking shots at Dabo,\" Meyer said in late January. \"They call him a whiner. Why is he whiny? … Dabo's doing the right thing. Turn 'em in. Absolutely, turn 'em in. If nothing happens, there's no governance, there's no rules, and it'll be the most chaotic… which it already is.”\n\nSouth Carolina coach Shane Beamer has also sided with Swinney.\n\n\"I don't blame him,\" Beamer said of Swinney. \"If that happened the way it's been described, that's a big deal. That's not a gray area. That's wrong.\n\n\"If you're going to have rules, then you have to enforce them. And if you don't enforce them, then what's the point? If someone is found guilty of doing that, I think the penalty should be severe.\"\n\nSpurrier was 5-2 in seven meetings against Swinney as South Carolina's head coach before resigning in 2015. He will be inducted into the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame in May.\n\nClemson AD Graham Neff on the NCAA’s response to turning Ole Miss in https://t.co/rJAcSGBhVG pic.twitter.com/Da64YIsH7I\n\n— Clemson Wire (@Clemson_Wire) January 27, 2026\n\nContact us @Clemson_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Clemson Tigers news and notes, plus opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Clemson Wire: Steve Spurrier has message for Dabo Swinney.

    "fullText": "Newly released documents detail convicted sex offender’s early backing of bitcoin and Coinbase\n\nMillions of files related to Jeffrey Epstein have brought to light his ties to the highest echelons of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDocuments published last week by the US Department of Justice reveal Epstein bankrolled the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, during its nascent stages; he also invested $3m in Coinbase in 2014, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and cut a check that same year to Blockstream, a prominent bitcoin-focused technology firm. Both crypto startups accepted Epstein’s investments in 2014 – six years after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nDespite murmurings among crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files’ revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.\n\nThe crypto companies that secured Epstein’s investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong, has heavily influenced crypto regulation in the United States.\n\nEpstein’s 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder of Tether, the world’s largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.\n\nDocuments published by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein’s investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additional filings suggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce’s firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.\n\nA spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEpstein’s financing of bitcoin’s development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MIT accepted more than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.\n\nIn communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT’s Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein’s “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab’s role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2014, Ito brokered Epstein’s investment in Blockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream’s co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, were invited by Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.\n\nOn Twitter, Back claimed that Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito’s fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.\n\nIn communications with an Italian investor, Epstein noted that he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017, checking in with his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread’s subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLuke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin’s development as well as to Blockstream, has called for Adam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream’s CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein’s interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin’s network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.\n\nCharlotte Fang, the founder of Remilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein’s investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase’s fundraise.\n\n“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.\n\n“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann of Komodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchanges might see new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn’t take money from “similar unsavory sources”.\n\nAs to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase’s IPO prospects,” he surmised.\n\nCryptocurrencies’ technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein’s interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor at York University who studies crypto.\n\n“There’s his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.",

    "description": "Former Real Housewives of New York star Bethenny Frankel moved to Florida last year. She's in her 'nightgown era' and is building a dating community.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 55-year-old Bethenny Frankel, former star of The Real Housewives of New York City and founder of The Core, a private dating membership community. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have a much bigger business now than when I was on The Real Housewives of New York City, was running Skinnygirl, my lifestyle brand famous for its low-calorie cocktails, and landed on the cover of Forbes.\n\nI got a big one-time check when I sold the liquor arm of Skinnygirl, but what I'm doing now, through The Core, my private dating membership community, influencing, and investing, is bigger than ever.\n\nI'm busy, but I'm not sitting at a desk every day. My brain works well, I have a phone, and that's really all I need. I wrote most of my New York Times bestselling books on a BlackBerry.\n\nHere's a typical day in my life.\n\nI wake up fairly early. I let the dogs out, then go give my daughter a hug and a kiss if she lets me in her room for a second. I really love that. I tend to troll her by sitting on her bed for a few minutes, but I've learned that teens don't like to talk in the morning.\n\nI make myself a strong iced coffee with my Cumulus coffee maker and feed the dogs. My dogs are really important to me, and I try to get as many good snuggles in with them as I can.\n\nBetween 7:30 and 8:30 a.m., I usually go for a walk on the beach. I moved from New York to South Florida in March 2025, and I love wandering around like a weirdo on the beach. I often finish the walks by jumping into the sea.\n\nI like taking calls while walking on the beach. In the morning, these are usually with one team member handling brand partnerships and appearances, and with my COO, where we discuss bigger deals, contract negotiations, and my investments.\n\nSince we launched The Core in December, it's taken up a big part of my day. It brings together the trust I've built as an entrepreneur with my crazy Rolodex of incredibly powerful and successful people.\n\nI'm passionate about it, and passion is my thing. When I start obsessing over something — it was the same with BStrong, my disaster-relief initiative I launched in 2017 in response to that year's devastating hurricane season — it's the only thing I'm talking about.\n\nLike every other business I've run, it's a case of building the plane while flying it. A lot of the work involves responding to texts and voice-noting somebody, asking them to do something.\n\nIf someone wants to get on the phone with me, I'll often take the call while I'm in the car. Otherwise, that time is wasted, and I don't waste time, food, or money.\n\nMy days aren't tightly structured, and I don't like feeling shackled by having too many things I have to do. The day often gets away from me before I've even showered, and my team will remind me that I have 15 minutes until I need to record my podcast, \"Just B with Bethenny Frankel.\"\n\nI record the episodes at home. Mostly, I don't care about having guests on. If I talk about my pillowcases and the bacterial facial infection I got on vacation, it will rate just as well as having Madonna.\n\nI'll usually rant for about an hour. I only like to sit and talk about what I want to talk about. It's almost like my own personal therapy monologue.\n\nThis year, I've been more open to meeting people for meals and coffee.\n\nOtherwise, I have my \"supermodel snacks\" for lunch, often seaweed stuffed with salad or turkey or rice cakes with avocado or cottage cheese.\n\nI don't plan to record my social media videos; it's mostly spontaneous. I don't post them as much as I used to. I've told my team I only want to put out excellent content, not filler.\n\nOften, my posts are just about something that's happened to me, and that leads companies to want to do brand deals. Once a week, I bang out those brand videos. The companies send the products to my home, and I film for two to three hours.\n\nI'm constantly being sent expensive things by major brands, from mattresses to nonalcoholic drinks to vape pipes. I also buy a lot of products to try myself. Once that stuff arrives, I want it out of my house as quickly as possible.\n\nAs a result, gift-giving has become a huge part of my day. If anyone does anything nice for me, whether it's at the nail salon or anywhere else, I want to give them a gift. I feel like the universe gave the \"get stuff\" crown to the right person: I like to share the wealth.\n\nIn the evenings, I try to protect my peace and avoid getting too activated by anything. I like to find a TV series that has thousands of episodes to work through. Right now, that's The Walking Dead, which I've been watching in my nightgown. I'm in my nightgown era. I also like to take a bath before I go to sleep.\n\nI listen to my body. I'm an efficient, very organized person, but I'm also a lounger, a pyjama-wearer, and a relaxer. I chill a decent amount each day.\n\nI also listen to my body for cues on when to eat or snack. I'll make dinner reservations, but often change them because I'm not hungry enough.\n\nI couldn't care less about traditional meal times.\n\nThe other night, I went to Trader Joe's and cooked a big dinner at home for my daughter, the guy I'm seeing, and a girlfriend. In Florida, I'm more sociable than I was in New York. I'm actually seeing other human life, outside of dating or being paid.\n\nWhat I cook often depends on what's already in the fridge. I enjoy the process of taking ingredients out, laying them out on the counter, and cooking.\n\nI also feel pride that my daughter sees that, even with how busy I am with my career, I'm able to do this really normal thing for her. That's meaningful for me.",

    "fullText": "After taking wins from Iowa and Samford to open the JoAnne Graf Classic, the Florida State Seminoles matched up against the Marshall Thundering Herd for two games.\n\nJazzy Francik got her second start of the weekend, after no hitting the Samford Bulldogs to open the season. Now, she entered against Marshall, only giving up one single to the Herd.\n\nWell, she won't have back-to-back no-hitters, but she's still pretty dang good😉\n\nJazzy strikes out two in the first and leaves one stranded\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/IaeajK9S0D\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 7, 2026\n\nOffensively, the Seminoles went up against Pai Maynard. Isa Torres got this started with a lead off triple, and was able to cross home on a wild pitch. The bats were able to get a few more on base, but left them stranded with a 1-0 score.\n\nSPPPEEEEEEDDDDD‼️\n\nIsa opens us up with a triple and comes home on a wild pitch to get the Noles on the board‼️\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/BOogahEju7\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 7, 2026\n\nFSU held on to a 1-0 lead going into the middle innings. Francik was able to get another strike out to begin the inning. A single, followed by a walk and error had Marshall with the bases loaded. With pressure facing Francik and the ‘Noles, a strike out and clutch defensive play from Marin Heller, kept their advantage.\n\nSTAYING WITH IT‼️‼️\n\nMarin keeps the Thundering Herd off the board🍢\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/fO9E6X5fQA\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 7, 2026\n\nThe freshmen kept their weekend going, with a single from Anna Hinde. Maynard got two quick outs for her defense, before she faced Makenna Sturgis in the nine spot. Needing some padding to the score, Sturgis came up with her first career homerun, adding two runs to their lead.\n\nFIRST CAREER HOMER MAKENNA STURGIS‼️‼️‼️\n\nWELCOME TO THE PARTY💣💣\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/o3lE7h0rkP\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 7, 2026\n\nTorres and Heller continued things with a bit of chaos on the bases. After a pair of singles and good base running, Heller brought her teammate home, with help from Marshall miscues.\n\nMaynard added Jaysoni Beachum and Shelby McKenzie to the base paths, both on walks. With the bases loaded and two out, Marshall was able to escape on a ground out, but the ‘Noles grew their lead to 4-0.\n\nMaynard got her first two outs before a double from Bella Ruggiero and single off the bat of Sturgis gave FSU traffic. With the lineup turning over, a fielding error from the Herd added two more runs for the ‘Noles.\n\nPut it in play and good things happen😄\n\n6-0 Noles🍢\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/BOXgh4Fj8f\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 7, 2026\n\nFrancik’s day came to an end after five innings, giving Bella Dimitrijevic her first appearance as a Seminole. Dimitrijevic gave up a lead off double before feeding her infield for two outs. Marshall wa able to load the bases against the new freshman pitcher, but Dimitrijevic got her first career strikeout to escape the jam.\n\nNeeding three outs to claim the win, Dimitrijevic retook the circle. She gave up a lead off single, but got the first out on a fielder’s choice play. However, the freshman still needed two outs and had a runner on base. A middle in pitch was too much for Sydni Burko to lay off, as she gave the Herd two runs on a homerun. Dimitrijevic capped off the game with a strikeout, pushing the ‘Noles to 3-0 on the weekend.\n\nMarlee Gaskell made her Seminole debut, and led off with a strikeout. She followed it up with a single and walk, but kept Marshall off the scoreboard.\n\nGot her😤\n\nMarlee gets the strikeout to get out of danger in the first🍢\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/agPsYGDjjQ\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 7, 2026\n\nMarshall threw Jules King in the circle, facing a potent FSU lineup. Besides a pair of baserunners for the Seminoles, King kept the bats quiet in the first inning.\n\nThe freshmen continued to shine, as Hayley Griggs went yard off of King. The long ball from Griggs was not only the first for her, but the first run of the second game.\n\nABSOLUTELY TATTOOED😱😱\n\nHayley joins the freshmen home run party‼️\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/IoYskqirU4\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 7, 2026\n\nKing put Madi Frey and Torres on base via walks, giving Heller runners. Heller was first pitch swinging, as she drove in a run on a line drive into the outfield. The third walk of the inning loaded the bases, but a line out from McKenzie limited the damage to a 2-0 score.\n\nBack out in the 3rd, Gaskell gave up a lead off single, which was kept on the infield. FSU went to the bullpen with a runner on, opting for Ashtyn Danley. Struggling to find the zone, Danley gave up back to back hits, resulting in a run for the Herd. Two strikeouts and a ground out, Danley escaped the the jam and limited the damage to just one run.\n\nBIG TIME😤\n\nAshtyn keeps the lead with the Noles with back-to-back strikeouts and a groundout to end the inning‼️\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/CpuHL1Q7Cg\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 8, 2026\n\nAnna Hinde, Griggs, and Sturgis all stood on the bases, after a series of hits off of King. With only one out, a ground ball on the infield from Frey was not handled. The error on the throw home brought in two runs, extending the FSU lead to 4-1.\n\nWith two runners in scoring position for the top of the lineup, Torres drove in the pair on a line drive into left field. Now a 6-1 score, Marshall went to the bullpen for Maddie Veal. In relief, Veal struck out one and got the ground out to keep the ‘Noles from any further scoring.\n\nThere she goes👀👀👀\n\nIsa with a pair of RBI to put the Noles up 6-1🍢\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/m6e1MYFsh7\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 8, 2026\n\nMarshall got one run back on Burko’s second homerun of the game, this time off of Danley. Again, she struggled to find the zone, giving up back to back walks to the Herd. The second walk marked the end of Danley’s time in the circle, getting Makenna Reid out of the bullpen. In relief, the senior cleaned up, sitting down the next two batters.\n\nA Griggs walk, followed by a one out double off the bat of Frey got the run back in the bottom of the inning. Back to back doubles from Torres and Heller grew the lead, making it 9-2 and a seven run advantage for the ‘Noles.\n\nNo fear, Madi Frey is here‼️\n\nShe gives the Noles some insurance with a RBI double🍢\n\n📺ACCNX#Team43 pic.twitter.com/fBuZLJ1eFw\n\n— Florida State Softball 🥎 (@FSU_Softball) February 8, 2026\n\nHeller moved to third on a ground out, bringing the second opportunity for McKenzie to walk off a game for second day in a row. A soft hit on the infield scored Heller, making it a 10-2 run rule of Marshall.\n\nFSU will cap off the JoAnne Graf Classic by facing UCONN on Feb. 8th at 9 am on ACCNX",

    "fullText": "Kimberly Jones was born and raised in Miami, and planned to live her whole life there. It's where she met her husband, raised her children, and built a four-decade career in logistics.\n\nBut in 2025, Jones did something she never expected: She and her husband left Plantation, Florida — nearly 20 minutes west of Fort Lauderdale — for a small rural town about an hour outside Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"It was not an easy decision,\" Jones, 60, told Business Insider. \"Affordability was part of it, but we were also looking forward to having a slower pace of life. I lived in South Florida my entire life — and it's not anything like what it used to be.\"\n\nJones said Southern Florida's population growth has made the area increasingly unrecognizable — and, for her, unlivable — pointing to hyper-development in residential construction and the gridlocked traffic she calls \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"If there's a corner available, they will build a high-rise on it,\" she said. \"It's turning into an overly congested, expensive city. I used to spend two and a half hours a day in the car just going to and from work.\"\n\nPeople are still moving to Florida, but they're not flocking to it like they used to. Net domestic migration — or the number of people moving into the state from elsewhere in the country minus those moving out to other parts of the US — has been steadily cooling in recent years.\n\nThere are a few likely reasons behind the cooler estimates in the Sunshine State. For some, the tax benefits of living in the state don't outweigh the increase in cost of living. It's more expensive to buy a home than a few years ago, and property insurance has been higher than in other states.\n\nIn recent years, Florida has drawn an influx of newcomers chasing its affordability, driven in large part by its wide range of relatively lower-cost housing and lack of state income tax. Others are lured by its business-friendly tax environment and strong job market.\n\nBut the surge of newcomers has created a host of challenges for native and longtime residents who have watched home prices and rents climb, especially in popular cities like Miami and Orlando. It's prompted some to move to less expensive cities and suburbs elsewhere in the state, or to leave Florida entirely.\n\n\"Affordability often drives a lot of domestic moves,\" Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Business Insider. \"People tend to move toward less expensive places. In recent years, Florida's gotten a lot more expensive, so Florida doesn't look as affordable compared to other places as it did even just a few years ago.\"\n\nIn December 2020, Florida's median home-sale price was $298,100; by December 2025, the most recent month with available data, it had climbed to $412,100, Redfin data showed. In addition to higher home prices and rents squeezing residents, home and flood insurance costs have increased, as more frequent and severe natural disasters push homeowners' premiums higher.\n\nTake Debra Pamplin, who moved from Florida back to the Midwest after 11 years. In 2013, Pamplin moved from her hometown of Missouri to Jacksonville, Florida. During her time there, though, she soured on the area's traffic, high insurance costs, uncomfortable heat and humidity, and mosquitoes. Pamplin has valued living in the Midwest much more.\n\n\"I'd often have to cut spending in other parts of my life just to cover my high monthly insurance costs,\" she said in a 2024 Business Insider story. \"Now that I'm out of Florida, my monthly insurance expenses are lower, giving me breathing room to spend my money on more fun stuff.\"\n\nMariya Letdin, an associate professor of real estate at Florida State University, told Business Insider that even as net migration slows, Florida is \"still a popular destination,\" but she expects its population will continue to grow slowly.\n\nAside from slower growth, the profile of who's moving to Florida is shifting, too.\n\nMichael Martirena, a real estate agent with Compass in South Florida, told Business Insider he's seen a change in the clients he works with, which he attributes in part to higher housing costs.\n\n\"Let's go back three years ago, pre-pandemic, everyone was coming down here. It didn't matter what socioeconomic class people were from; they just wanted to come to Florida.\" Now, he said, he's working with more buyers from abroad, as well as wealthy American buyers.\n\nHamilton Lombard, a demographic researcher based in Virginia, said immigrants moving elsewhere within the US could also be a factor as to why Florida's domestic migration has weakened. Census data showed that non-citizens who moved between states in the past year from Florida increased from about 30,000 in 2022 to 53,500 in 2024, the latest year available.\n\nFlorida's net international migration has also been cooling, but remains positive, meaning more people are immigrating to Florida from other countries than leaving for destinations outside the US.\n\n\"International and affluent buyers still continue to come down to Florida, whether it's for tax purposes or geopolitical reasons or what's going on in their states,\" Martirena said, adding that a lot of his clientele comes from countries like Dubai, Madrid, and London.",

    "description": "After a 2024 layoff, Alex English struggled to find work in LA and moved back to Tampa, Florida. He said he's happier despite still job hunting.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alex English, a 38-year-old marketing and communications professional who has been unemployed for over a year and a half, based in Tampa. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been unemployed for a year and a half. Before being laid off, I lived in LA and worked in marketing and communications at a startup. I was making around $125,000 and still felt poor.\n\nAfter five years at my last job, I was handed a layoff like it was nothing. I moved back to where I grew up in Tampa, Florida, because I didn't have the savings to sustain myself in LA.\n\nI've relentlessly networked to find a full-time job, taken on freelance projects, and worked in retail. I feel like I'm working harder than I ever have and yet making significantly less money than I did before. My friends who aren't dealing with long-term unemployment don't see my crisis as a crisis. That can be really hard, but I've worked on removing the emotional intensity from the situation.\n\nI hadn't been happy at work for a while. I was well paid, and the company was successful, but it didn't feel like we were improving anyone's life or solving any real problems. It all started to feel like, What am I doing? Where's the value here?\n\nIn my 20s and 30s, I never really believed in my own capabilities, so I never saw that job as a stepping stone to a better role or company. It was comfortable, predictable, and seemingly quite stable.\n\nI've never been good at saving money, so after getting laid off, I was most worried about my finances, but I had a false sense of security, getting unemployment and three months of severance. At the time, I was burned out and not very interested in immediately hitting the ground running to find my next role.\n\nI was always spending almost everything I made and never had an ingrained ethos of saving for a rainy day or investing. Going out to eat and shopping ate into my savings.\n\nI got laid off at the end of June, and by September, I was freaking out.\n\nI made all the plans to come home and live with family, figuring out how to move and ship my car, and bring my two cats. It was just a lot of stress, but I needed to do it.\n\nIt's been hard finding a job in Tampa. I've been reintroducing myself to people and trying to get ingrained in the ecosystem. It's changed and grown up without me. The job market here feels like it's a lot about who you know and having people vouch for you.\n\nI'm happier here even though I'm still trying to find my next opportunity. I loved visiting big cities growing up, but leaving LA, I realized I wasn't hungry enough or career-oriented enough to compete there.\n\nI just didn't feel like I had the energy or the stamina to stay in LA, stick it out, and fight to climb over people to get somewhere. The pressures of the cost of living and just getting attention in a crowded market were too much. I have all these supporters here in Tampa with my family and friends. LA is a beautiful place, but it can be very lonely. I honestly felt like I couldn't deal with that anymore.\n\nI think we are often so fixated on a steady ascent in our lives, with things always moving in an upward, positive direction. When it all comes crashing down, it feels like a personal failing. I've had to focus on what's been good in my life, even if it's not a fantastic, sparkling career. I have a good family, good friends, and my health.\n\nIf I found a job that paid $65,000, was something I'd enjoy doing, and felt meaningful, I'd probably be like, \"Praise the Lord.\"\n\nI've been forcing myself to write down things that I'm grateful for and absorb content, whether it's podcasts or other things that help me feel better and less alone. I take these steps, instead of living on Instagram and looking at what everybody else is doing.\n\nI've also worked on realizing that these things do happen to people, and that it's not the end of the world. Overcoming a layoff might require rethinking some of your assumptions or how you're going to progress in your career.\n\nDo you have a story to share about long-term unemployment?

    "description": "State culled a number of the non-native reptiles after thousands were ‘cold-stunned’ and dropped from trees",
    "fullText": "Wildlife officials in Florida say they euthanized more than 5,000 non-native iguanas in the state after hordes of the reptiles froze and fell from trees in this week’s cold snap.\n\nThe Florida fish and wildlife commission (FWC) authorized the first officially sanctioned cull of “cold-stunned” iguanas as temperatures plunged below freezing in many areas of the state.\n\nMembers of the public, and professional pest control companies, brought 5,195 of the large, invasive green iguanas to FWC collection centers, where they were euthanized.\n\nAlmost all of the roundup occurred in south Florida, where the creatures started falling from trees on Saturday. The tropical iguanas’ systems shut down below 45F, but they can remain alive for days, stiff and motionless until temperatures rise.\n\nA majority, 3,882, were delivered to the FWC headquarters in Sunrise. Another 1,075 were taken to Tequesta; there were 215 at Marathon, in the Florida Keys, and 23 at Fort Myers, the FWC said.\n\nThe commission passed an emergency order last week setting up the two-day drop-off for Sunday and Monday, using the cold snap as an limited-time advantage in its efforts to reduce numbers of a burrowing species blamed for damage to sidewalks, seawalls and other infrastructure, as well as having a voracious appetite for native plants and flowers.\n\n“As an invasive species, green iguanas have negative impacts on Florida’s environment and economy,” Roger Young, executive director of the FWC, said in a statement.\n\n“The removal of over 5,000 of these non-native lizards in such a short time span was only possible thanks to the coordinated efforts of many staff members in multiple FWC divisions and offices, our partners, and of course the many residents that took the time to collect and turn in cold-stunned iguanas from their properties.”\n\nTemperatures in south Florida, which reached their lowest since at least 2010, rose again significantly by Wednesday, with many thousands more fallen iguanas that were not collected warming up and recovering from their extended torpor.\n\nThe public is permitted to humanely kill green iguanas year-round on their property, or with landowner permission, but it is illegal to own them as pets or transport them without a license.\n\nThe early-week rare arctic air in south and central Florida, meanwhile, will deliver a $13bn-$15bn hit in economic damage to the state, notably in hard-hit citrus groves and other agricultural industries, according to AccuWeather.\n\n“This recent freeze may have destroyed or severely damaged 8-10% of the current citrus crop on the trees. We will learn more about the extent of the damage as the citrus groves are assessed in the coming days,” AccuWeather founder and executive chair Joel Myers said.\n\nProducers warned that prices for Florida-grown fruit and vegetables are likely to rise in the coming days and weeks as a result, and Wilton Simpson, the state’s agriculture commissioner, has called on the US Department of Agriculture to approve a disaster declaration opening federal aid to farmers and suppliers.\n\nTemperatures dropping to the low 40s fahrenheit were expected in south Florida again this weekend.",

    "fullText": "Duane “Dog the Bounty Hunter” Chapman’s stepson Gregory Zecca is facing life behind bars if convicted of aggravated manslaughter after fatally shooting his teenage son.\n\nFlorida’s Collier County Sheriff’s Office posted an update on the July 2025 incident via Facebook on Tuesday, February 3, stating that Zecca accidentally shot his child, Anthony, 13, in the family’s Naples, Florida, apartment while allegedly under the influence of alcohol. Local Southwest Florida news outlet WINK News was first to report on the update.\n\nPer the Sheriff’s Office, Zecca, 39, was taken into custody “on a warrant for aggravated manslaughter of a child with a firearm and using a firearm while under the influence,” which could result in a life sentence.\n\nA Collier County police investigation into Zecca, who is the son of Dog’s wife, Francie Chapman, from a previous marriage, found that Zecca allegedly “consumed alcohol over several hours at a local establishment, purchased more alcohol, and later used both alcohol and marijuana at a friend's residence.”\n\nChase Chrisley Breaks Down His Drinking Habits and Battery Arrest: ‘Hit Rock Bottom’\n\nZecca and his son were “watching a UFC fight on TV at the time.”\n\nLaw enforcement also reported that Zecca “repeatedly handled a firearm in his son's presence, practicing drawing it from his waistband and dry-firing.” The firearm had “initially been made safe by removing the magazine and clearing a live round from the chamber.”\n\nFurther detail stated that the magazine was put back into the firearm before Zecca “discharged a single shot” that struck Anthony.\n\nSheriff Kevin Rambosk stated in the update that the event “was a heartbreaking and preventable tragedy.”\n\nFormer UFC Champion Cain Velasquez Sentenced to Prison in Attempted Murder Case\n\nRambosk added, “Our detectives conducted an exhaustive and thorough investigation, examining every element of what happened through witness statements, forensic testing, subpoenas, search warrants, and more.”\n\nPolice officials also noted that deputies who arrived at the scene “detected the odor of alcohol on Zecca and observed marijuana in plain view.”\n\nA subsequent toxicology report estimated Zecca's “blood-alcohol concentration to be approximately 0.116 at the time of the shooting, above Florida's legal limit of 0.08.”\n\nZecca was placed on a psychiatric hold following the shooting. A family representative told TMZ one day after the incident occurred that Zecca was “under observation on a 5150 hold,” which meant that he had been involuntarily detained for 72 hours after being deemed “a danger to themselves, to others, or gravely disabled,” per Clear Behavior Health.\n\nBachelorette’s DeAnna Pappas Celebrates Son’s 9th Birthday After Arrest, Incident With Ex\n\nThe rep also told the outlet at the time that the hold was instigated because Zecca was “overcome with grief” and not because he felt guilty of a crime.\n\nDog released a statement via the outlet in the shooting’s aftermath. “We are grieving as a family over this incomprehensible tragic accident and would ask for continued prayers as we grieve the loss of our beloved grandson, Anthony,” Dog and Francie both wrote at the time.\n\nZecca also disabled his Instagram account after the incident. Prior to the account’s disappearance, Zecca had posted photos of himself with Anthony, including one image that showed the pair at a shooting range.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

    "description": "Florida football defensive tackle Caleb Banks lands with the Chargers in ESPN's latest NFL mock draft after a strong Senior Bowl showing.",
    "fullText": "Former Florida football defensive tackle Caleb Banks is projected to be selected by the Los Angeles Chargers with the No. 22 pick, according to ESPN's latest 2026 NFL mock draft.\n\nAccording to analyst Matt Miller, his reasoning is pretty straightforward: the Chargers need more of a true anchor on the defensive line, and Banks fits the mold as a nose tackle who can hold ground against the run while still bringing some juice as a power rusher.\n\nBanks is listed at 6-feet-6-inches and 339 pounds, and Miller describes him as an \"aggressive bull rusher\" with rare first-step quickness for a guy built like that.\n\nBanks' most recent season with the Gators didn't look normal on paper because he was limited to two games due to a foot injury. That's the type of thing that can quietly stall a prospect's momentum, especially when draft cycles move as fast as they do. But that's also where the Senior Bowl comes in.\n\nHis week in Mobile, Alabama, was well-received by scouts, and it sounds like the practices helped reintroduce him as a disruptor instead of \"the injured guy who missed time.\"\n\nBanks still has plenty of runway left in the pre-draft process, and his medicals and testing will matter a ton. But getting slotted in the first round, even in a mock, is the kind of headline that sticks. It puts Banks firmly in the \"name to know\" tier as draft talk heats up.\n\n\"The run on edge rushers before this pick leaves the Chargers with some interesting decisions. Do they add to an offensive line that was marred by injury in 2025 or try to fix a D-line that still needs a true anchor to help defend the run?\n\n\"With the talent that's left on the board, Banks would be very enticing as the nose tackle Los Angeles is missing. The 6-foot-6, 339-pounder is an aggressive bull rusher with rare first-step quickness for his size. Think Vita Vea, but with better length. Banks missed all but two games last season due to a foot injury, but his Senior Bowl performance was well-received by scouts, who saw the explosive play in the trenches that excited them entering the 2025 season.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nIf you purchase through our links, the USA Today Network may earn a commission.

    "fullText": "Florida football finds itself right in the middle of the SEC pack in CBS Sports' power rankings for the 2026 season, a reflection of both uncertainty and quiet optimism surrounding the program entering Jon Sumrall's first year with the Orange and Blue.\n\nCBS Sports' Brandon Marcello slotted the Gators 10th in the SEC, placing Florida firmly in the conference's crowded middle tier following a chaotic transfer portal cycle and a full coaching reset.\n\nSumrall inherited a group that needed significant turnover, and that context matters. Florida lost key contributors to the portal, rebuilt large portions of its depth chart and is still sorting out several position battles heading into spring practice.\n\nCBS Sports pointed specifically to quarterback uncertainty, noting the compeition between Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo and Tramell Jones Jr. as a storyline that could ultimately swing Florida's ceiling one way or another.\n\nIt's simply too early to make definitive judgements. Spring practices, sumeer development and continued roster movement will reshape the conference landscape before fall arrives. For Florida, that means the current ranking by CBS Sports should be viewed more as a snapshot than a verdict.\n\nFor now, the Gators are positioned as a team with something to prove.\n\nHere is everything Marcello wrote about Florida and why he ranked them at No. 10 in the SEC power rankings.\n\n\"Jon Sumrall arrives with a major rebuild on his hands in Gainesville. The former Tulane and Troy coach has never won less than 10 games in a single season, but make sure to temper your expectations for Year 1 in the SEC. He had to overhaul a roster depleted by transfers, and we don't quite know what to expect with Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo battling Tramell Jones Jr. at quarterback.\n\n\"Still, Sumrall has the magic touch and knows how to build rosters. He also hired a top-tier staff. The Gators could be in the top half of the SEC this season, but we need to see more this spring and summer to better gauge the Gators.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.",

    "fullText": "FORT LAUDERDALE — Panthers star forward Sam Bennett suffered an upper-body injury during Florida’s loss to Buffalo on Monday night. It’s the latest in a series of injuries that have decimated the reigning Stanley Cup champions, who have lost four straight games.\n\n“It seems like somebody’s getting injured every night,” Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk said.\n\nPanthers coach Paul Maurice said Bennett — who was reportedly picked to replace Tampa Bay’s Anthony Cirelli for the Canadian Olympic team on Tuesday — and fellow forwards Anton Lundell and Brad Marchand may be able to play Wednesday against Boston, but the team has not made that determination yet.\n\n“There’s a chance they could all play tomorrow,” Maurice said. “There’s a chance not to play tomorrow, but we won’t know till after the morning skate.”\n\nBennett’s injury meant all four of the Panthers’ centers from last year’s Stanley Cup team — captain Aleksander Barkov, Lundell, Bennett and Tomas Nosek — are hurt. Florida needed winger Eetu Luostarinen to move to center, a position he previously played, to fill the void on Monday.\n\n“He was good; five on two on the draws,” Maurice said Monday. “I like him better on the wing because of what Lundell does, what the two of them can do, but everybody needed to play all over.”\n\nThe growing list of injuries that have plagued Florida all season have not gone unnoticed.\n\n“When you get started blowing up barbecues, you start to think,” Maurice said, referring to Luostarinen suffering an injury while grilling earlier this season. “… But I would say that in everything that’s happened here over the last four years, there’s something to be gleaned out of your adversity.”\n\nMaurice said the team needs to stick to its foundation and stay confident so they avoid pressing. He said the Panthers did that in their loss to Buffalo.\n\n“I think sometimes you’ll sit so defensively because of the urgency and it’s also the foundation of your game,” Maurice said. “But we put up (42 shots) last night and felt we had opportunities to score. So there has to be a certain amount of freedom and ease in your game for the confidence to stay and to make plays because you can’t just (keep) kicking it out into the neutral zone all night. I thought we were good with that last game. Most important thing is you have a foundation. That has to be there first. You can’t lose that ease in your game where you’re too tight to create.”\n\nTkachuk said right now the Panthers just have to grind out close victories.\n\n“We cannot try to outskill teams — and that’s not what we were trying to do — but at some points in the game, we are doing that. We’re just playing into their hands,” Tkachuk said. “… We’ve just got to try to get back to the basics. We’ve got to try to win a 1-0, 2-1 game here and just try to go from there. We’re in one right now, and if we don’t simplify it, this year’s going to get away from us.”\n\nThe Panthers are feeling the urgency of the moment. Florida plays Boston on Wednesday and Tampa Bay on Thursday before the team gets a three-week break for the Olympics. But Tkachuk said the Panthers, who are currently nine points out of a playoff spot, need to turn things around before the break; they cannot wait any longer.\n\n“This could get away from us if we don’t figure it out,” Tkachuk said. “It has to start next game. We’ve got two games left, and Boston’s another team we’re chasing that’s a wild card team, so we’ve got to get it.”",

    "fullText": "Florida basketball's brutal home loss to the Auburn Tigers two weeks ago is well in the rearview mirror after a pair of superlative performances — a 47-point beatdown of the South Carolina Gamecocks on the road, followed by an epic victory in the O'Dome against the Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nAs a result of the Gators' plus-70 margin of victory over the last two games, Todd Golden finds his team up five spots in the latest USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll at No. 16. That puts the Orange and Blue between the No. 15 Vanderbilt Commodores and No. 17 Virginia Cavaliers.\n\nThat kick in the pants at home appears to have given Florida a wake-up call, and now the Gators have put the rest of the SEC — and college basketball — on notice with nine games remaining on the regular-season schedule.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference once again has only four member schools in this week's poll, with Vanderbilt hanging onto their league-high No. 15 ranking. Florida is right behind them at No. 16, followed by the Arkansas Razorbacks, who fell five spots to No. 21, and the Texas A&M Aggies, who entered the rankings for the first time this season at No. 25.\n\nAlabama fell out of the top 25, and now follows the de facto No. 27 Tennessee Volunteers (55 votes) with 15 votes. The Kentucky Wildcats continue to cling to their nine votes while the Georgia Bulldogs earned a pair this week.\n\nIowa 52; Tennessee 50; UCF 15; Alabama 15; Villanova 13; Kentucky 9; North Carolina State 4; Utah State 2; Georgia 2; Saint Mary's 1\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida basketball USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll ranking up after win",

Alabama received the second-most total votes of any unranked team with 48, sitting behind only Texas A&M at 83.\n\nThis past week, previously ranked No. 23 Alabama played a pair of SEC games, starting with an impressive 90-64 home win over Missouri on Tuesday night.

    "description": "“We’re probably at like 2,000 iguanas,” said Redline Iguana Removal owner Blake Wilkins.",
    "fullText": "South Florida iguana removal companies were scooping up hundreds of cold-stunned and dead lizards Sunday in a seemingly record-breaking roundup due to the cold snap, according to local business owners.\n\n“We are scooping them up by the dozens,” said Blake Wilkins, owner of Redline Iguana Removal in Hollywood.\n\nIt was 35.1 degrees with a wind chill of 27 around 7 a.m. Sunday at Miami Internation Airport, beating the previous Feb. 1 record low of 36, set in 1909. With those cold temps, the iguana removal business was booming.\n\nIguanas and other reptiles can lose muscle control and go into a state of shock, appearing “frozen,” when temperatures dip near freezing. On Friday, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission lifted its normal restrictions and said that on Sunday and Monday, people could trap the iguanas, a non-native invasive species, and bring them to five FWC offices so they could be humanely killed or transferred to permitted pet operators.\n\nWilkins said his trappers started working from about 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. to take advantage of the weather and had already been to at least 100 locations by Sunday afternoon. At one golf course, Redline Iguana Removal picked up about 100 iguanas within an hour.\n\n“We’re probably at like 2,000 iguanas,” Wilkins said.\n\nThe cold temperatures, combined with the wind knocking the iguanas out of trees, created a “kind of double factor,” he said, adding that he had dodged a falling iguana earlier.\n\nWilkins said he’s been removing iguanas for a decade, and this is definitely the strongest cold front with the most frozen iguanas he’s seen. About 50% of the iguanas removed were dead.\n\n“I’d say it happens every year but not to this magnitude,” he said. “This is a strong one, for sure.”\n\nThe company truck was “absolutely stacked” with cold-stunned and dead iguanas, and the calls for removal will continue Monday, he said.\n\n“It may be kind of gruesome for people, but it’s a good idea of what we’ve gotten,” Wilkins said.\n\nSteve Kavashansky, owner of Iguana Busters in West Palm Beach, joked that he was doing much better than the iguanas were on Sunday. His business offers removal from Jupiter to just north of Miami.\n\nThe calls for removal across South Florida have been nonstop, and Iguana Busters hasn’t had time to take on new customers because it’s so busy, Kavashansky said. By around 2 p.m., his trappers were on their 45th call of the day.\n\nHis company had collected close to 150 iguanas, and the majority of them were cold-stunned rather than dead, he said. From his experience, the iguanas have been acclimating to the cooler temperatures over the years.\n\n“Last year, we maybe had five, maybe 10 calls, and that was over the whole winter,” Kavashansky said. “This year, just today alone, we are up to 45 calls.”\n\nWhile the FWC designated locations for members of the public to drop off captured, cold-stunned iguanas on Sunday and Monday, Kavashansky said he would not recommend picking them up.\n\nThe FWC did not respond to a request for comment on how many iguanas were turned over Sunday in South Florida.\n\nA couple of years ago, one woman picked up a stunned iguana and put it in her car, Kavashansky said. The iguana woke up as it warmed up, whipped her with its tail, and she crashed.\n\n“If you’re not trained to deal with these animals, I wouldn’t do it,” he said.",

    "fullText": "The blueberry and strawberry fields at Southern Hill Farms were buried in chunks of ice.\n\nWhile it can look picturesque amid the morning sun, it can also be catastrophic to the plants – and the farmers' business.\n\nThe plants were sprayed with light water overnight to create a thin ice layer, which helps to protect the plants. Too much ice, however, can cause the plants to break and topple over.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nCLERMONT, Fla. - In the light of day, it looks like a glass forest. Every leaf, every branch, and every fruit in this Lake County field is encased in a thick, translucent armor.\n\nBut for the farmers here, this isn’t a winter wonderland.\n\nThe owners and staff at Southern Hill Farms in Clermont, Florida, did not sleep – staying awake throughout the night to monitor their plants and fields as freezing temperatures hit the area.\n\n\"We knew it was gonna be a terrible night. When you make ice at eight o'clock, it's gonna be bad, bad night,\" said David Hill, one of the owners.\n\n\"We've done this a million times when it was a cold event. We run overhead irrigation to either to wash frost off or to freeze, put a protective layer of water, ice around the berry and the plant. Normally, it's 30 degrees, 32 degrees, wind's not real high. The event we had last night was catastrophic.\"\n\nThe ice got too heavy for some of the sprinklers that hover above the fields. So, when the plants became to heavy and fell, the sprinkler systems go with it.\n\n\"We've got overhead irrigation pipes in field and they were, you know, the the plants are all around there and they were solid ice, they would take down the pipes with it,\" the owners said.\n\nSunday night brings more freezing temperatures to the area. The farm closed Saturday and Sunday due to the ice.\n\nWhat's next is to get through the night, evaluate the damage, and then figure out how to move forward.\n\n\"During a freeze event, farmers use overhead irrigation to protect crops by continuously applying water. As that water freezes, it releases heat, creating a protective layer of ice that helps keep plants at a survivable temperature. It’s a delicate balance that requires constant monitoring, long hours, and a whole lot of experience,\" the farm wrote on its Facebook page.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nFOX 35's Jessica Dobson was at Southern Hill Farms on Sunday morning, Feb. 1, 2026. She talked to the owners and gave viewers a first-hand look at the ice. Southern Hill also posted about the ice and freezing temperatures on its Facebook page.",

    "fullText": "Florida State (7-15, 2-8 ACC) was defeated by Clemson (16-7, 7-4 ACC) by a 77-58 score this afternoon at Littlejohn Coliseum.\n\nClemson scored the first four points of the game as the Tigers did a great job forcing Florida State to take tough shots. Sole Williams hit a driving layup for the first Seminole points. Midway through the quarter Clemson hit FSU with a 10-2 run to take a 16-9 lead. Tatum Greene buried a three to end the run. Taylor Johnson-Matthews hit a triple to give Clemson a 21-15 lead going into the second quarter.\n\nThat shot from Johnson-Matthews sparked the Tigers to a 10-1 run that allowed them to take a 28-16 lead. Mari Gerton broke the run with a nifty putback. However, the Tigers were able to stretch the lead to 42-27 at the half.\n\nThe Tigers ended the third quarter on a 10-2 run to take a 60-41 lead into the fourth quarter. From there Clemson cruised to the 77-58 victory.\n\nSole Williams was the only Seminole in double figures with 23 points.\n\nThe story of this game was that Florida State was unable to maintain any offensive continuity. If the Seminoles aren’t hitting threes (5-21 today) the offense really struggles. This is due to the fact that FSU rarely gets easy baskets. There are a couple of reasons for the lack of easy baskets. First, Florida State usually plays one-on-one offense in the frontcourt. This means that unless there is a blow-by, the shot will be contested. Secondly, the Seminoles don’t get many transition buckets (two fast break points today) or second chance points (13 today). These are the two main ways to get easy baskets.\n\nThe Seminoles did hold their own on the boards and they only had 12 turnovers which is a reasonable number. However, it is tough to beat good teams when you shoot so poorly from the field.\n\nThe Seminoles will travel to Raleigh, NC to face NC State on Thursday. The game will tip at 8pm and will be broadcast on the ACC Network.",

Deputies said the driver was traveling 104 mph, dangerously tailgating other vehicles and moving across lanes of travel to pass other vehicles.\n\nThe department identified the driver as Richardson, who was arrested and charged with \"Dangerous Excessive Speeding,\" a charge that applies when a driver is traveling 100 mph or more.\n\nThe arrest marks the latest legal issue involving the 25-year-old Olympic sprinter, who is one of the most high-profile figures in American track and field.\n\nRichardson was arrested last summer on a domestic violence charge at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. On July 27, Port of Seattle Police arrested Richardson after security footage showed her and fellow Olympian Christian Coleman involved in a verbal argument, during which Richardson allegedly pushed Coleman and threw a pair of headphones at him, according to officials. Coleman declined to participate in the investigation, WFAA previously reported.\n\nFollowing that arrest, Richardson posted a series of Instagram stories saying she had been reflecting on her actions and working to move forward in a positive way. She also publicly apologized to Coleman, who was her boyfriend at the time.\n\nNo additional details about the Florida traffic stop. Richardson is being held in the Orange County Jail on a $500 bond.",

    "fullText": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A Republican opponent is challenging U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s eligibility to run for governor of Alabama, accusing the football coach-turned-politician of not meeting the legal requirement to have lived in the state for seven years.\n\nKen McFeeters, who is running against Tuberville for the Republican nomination for governor, filed the challenge Tuesday with the Alabama Republican Party. McFeeters in a phone interview said he believes Tuberville lives in a multimillion-dollar beach home in Florida instead of a smaller home that he has listed as his residence in Auburn, Alabama.\n\nProperty tax records show the former Auburn University football coach has a home in Auburn, Alabama ,with an appraised value of $291,780 on which he claims a homestead exemption. He also has a beach home in Walton County, Florida with an estimated market value of $5.5 million, according to property records.\n\nThe Auburn house was initially purchased by Tuberville’s wife and son in 2017. The senator's name was later added to the property, and the son's name removed. Both the Auburn and Florida homes appear to have recently been put in a revocable trust with Tuberville's wife as trustee.\n\n“It’s belittling to the average person in Alabama for him to think we believe that he’s being sincere when he says he lives at his son’s $300,000 house when he’s got a $6 million beach house. Where would you live?” McFeeters said.\n\nMcFeeters wrote in his letter to party officials that the available records, “if accurate, strongly suggest that Auburn may have been used as an address of convenience rather than as a true domicile.” McFeeters said Tuberville’s travel records also show frequent travel to the Florida Panhandle, which he said buttresses the idea that he resides in the location.\n\nMallory Jaspers, a spokeswoman for Tuberville, called the challenge a “ridiculous PR stunt from a desperate candidate.”\n\n“Senator Tuberville has proudly represented Alabama in the United States Senate for the past six years. This made-up narrative didn’t work when he was running for Senate in 2019, and it certainly isn’t going to work now,” Jaspers wrote in an email. Jaspers said the Auburn home remains the senator’s primary residence.\n\nTuberville faced similar accusations in his Senate campaign. Opponents called him “Florida man” or a “tourist in Alabama.” The Senate has a less stringent residency requirement before taking office.\n\nTuberville told The Associated Press earlier this month that he believes he meets the residency requirement.\n\n“We checked it out. I wouldn’t be doing this if I thought it was a problem,” Tuberville said. Tuberville said it will be up to the Republican Party to decide any challenge, but “what I’ve heard from them, they feel good about it.”\n\nTuberville was the head football coach at Auburn University from 1999 to 2008. He then coached at Texas Tech and the University of Cincinnati. He went to work for ESPN after retiring from coaching. In a 2017 promotional video for ESPN, he talked about moving to Florida after retiring from coaching.\n\nTuberville voted in Florida in 2018. He registered to vote in Alabama on March 28, 2019, about two weeks before announcing his run for Senate.\n\nJeannie Burniston, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Republican Party, said challenges are heard and decided by the party’s 21-member steering committee. Burniston said the committee will decide if there is enough evidence for a challenge to proceed to a hearing where both sides present evidence. Burniston said she cannot comment on challenges.\n\nThe awkwardly worded requirement in the Alabama Constitution says the governor and lieutenant governor “shall have been citizens of the United States ten years and resident citizens of this state at least seven years next before the date of their election.”\n\nMcFeeters said it is important that the Republican Party take the matter seriously. He said Tuberville should be asked to provide clear evidence that he has lived in Alabama for seven consecutive years.\n\nSusan Pace Hamill, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, said the language of the residency requirement is vague. She said it could be interpreted to be seven consecutive years or it could be seven years broken up by periods living elsewhere. But she said Alabama’s culture and history supports the argument that it should be seven consecutive years.\n\n“Alabama’s culture is suspicious of outsiders and historically most of Alabama’s governors were born and raised in the state, often having been descended from generations of Alabamians,” Hamill wrote in an email. Her comments were first reported by the Alabama Reflector.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — Winter's brutal grip on the U.S. East is not letting up, with coming days bringing subfreezing temperatures that will plunge deep into what had been a toasty Florida peninsula and a powerful blizzard forecast that may strike the Atlantic coast.\n\nDeep cold is forecast to stick around at least into the first week of February. Meteorologists are also watching what could become a “ bomb cyclone ” — a quickly intensifying storm that’s a winter version of a hurricane — forming off the Carolinas Friday night into Saturday.\n\n“A major winter storm appears to be coming to the Carolinas,” said meteorologist Peter Mullinax of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThat storm could dump snow — at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) with white-out conditions — in the Carolinas, northern Georgia and southern Virginia. After that, it could turn and plow through the Interstate 95 corridor late Saturday into Sunday to dump loads more snow from Washington to Boston, further paralyzing much of the country. Or it could deliver a glancing blow, mostly striking places like Cape Cod.\n\nAlternatively, it could just veer off harmlessly to sea. Meteorologists and forecast models aren't yet settling on a single outcome.\n\n“The confidence is much higher that in the coastal Carolinas and Virginia that there will be significant snowfall this weekend,” said James Belanger, vice president for meteorology at the Weather Channel and its parent company. \"The real question is going to be the trajectory it takes” from there.\n\nPrivate meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former NOAA chief scientist, said for the mid-Atlantic and north it's a “boom or bust” situation. “If it happens (to go along the coast) it's going to be a big-time event.\"\n\nModels still disagree on storm track\n\nOn Tuesday forecast models were all over the place, from out to sea to inward toward Philadelphia. By Wednesday morning they started to agree that “we’re likely to see some form of a powerful coastal storm somewhere east of North Carolina, off the Delmarva coast, but they still disagree as to where,” Mullinax said.\n\nChances of the storm veering away from the East Coast entirely had diminished Wednesday morning, but hadn't disappeared altogether, Mullinax said.\n\nOf all the options, “from D.C. up to New York is probably the most unclear,” Mullinax said. He said a mere 50-mile (80-kilometer) difference in the storm's center will be critical. AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said it may be hard for the southern mid-Atlantic to avoid some kind of snow, whether a little or a lot.\n\nThis storm will blow harder than the last one\n\nThis weekend's storm will differ from the previous storm, which started with moist air from the Pacific that combined with a deep plunge of Arctic air from an elongated polar vortex supplemented by more moisture from the south and east, meteorologists said. The last storm had little wind. This one will generate high winds, even if the snow misses the Washington area, generating gusts that could still reach 40 mph (65 kph), plunging wind chills near subzero Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius), Mullinax said.\n\n“It looks like a pretty strong and explosive storm so everybody is going to have some gusty winds,\" Pydynowski said, even inland places that won't come close to getting snow like Pittsburgh. Strong winds may take daytime temperatures in the teens there down to feeling like they are below zero, he said.\n\n“This is what we'd consider more of a classic nor'easter,” Belanger said, describing a storm forming around the U.S. Gulf Coast crossing into the Atlantic and going up that coast.\n\nFrigid air and warm water combine to make strong storm\n\nIn this case, one key is warmer-than-normal water in the Gulf of Mexico — partly from human-caused climate change — and the always toasty Atlantic Gulf Stream, said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist for the nonprofit Climate Central.\n\nWhen that happens the storm “pulls in more moisture and it gives it more strength,” she said.\n\nOnce the core of the storm nears the Carolinas its pressure will drop tremendously, enough to qualify for what meteorologists call “bombogenesis” or “a bomb cyclone,” That will give it the effect of a moderate-strength hurricane, including huge winds, but in the winter, Maue and Belanger said.\n\nIf the storm does come ashore, those winds and extra snow could cause massive snow drifts big enough to bury cars, Maue said.\n\nArctic chill sticks around and goes further south\n\nWhat is more certain is that the Arctic chill in the Midwest and East will continue through mid-February, with only slight warmups that would still be below normal, meteorologists said.\n\nAnd this new weekend storm “is going to take that cold and it's going to spill right down the heart of the Florida peninsula,\" Pydynowski said. Orlando is forecast to go well below freezing and only have a high of 48 F (9 C), smashing temperature records, while even Miami and Key West will flirt with record cold Sunday and Monday, meteorologists said.\n\nThe outlook for Florida was cold enough to raise concerns about damage to the state’s citrus and strawberries.\n\n“We're going into a brutally cold period,” Maue said.\n\nAfter this weekend storm, long-range models see another one at the end of the first week of February, Maue said. Meteorologists see the East stuck in a pattern of bitter cold and snowstorms because of the plunging Arctic air and warm water.\n\nEast Coast snowstorms don't happen too often, but “when it happens, it happens in bunches,\" said former National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini, who has written meteorology textbooks on winter snowstorms.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "A professional python hunter in Florida needed assistance from family members to uncoil a giant Burmese python from his body and to ultimately subdue the second-heaviest python ever caught in Florida.\n\nCarl Jackson, who is a contracted python hunter with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, was traveling back on Turner River Road in Big Cypress National Park in the afternoon on Jan. 13 when he noticed Burmese python tracks across the road over his truck tracks, as reported by Naples News.\n\nThey appeared to be tracks from a smaller snake, perhaps an 8-footer, tops.\n\n“I go in [to the bushes] and walk around and I see a head,” Jackson told Naples News.\n\nHe immediately recognized that this was not a small snake.\n\nJackson began wrestling with the huge python, which dragged him an estimated 10 to 15 feet over a red and black ant hill.\n\n“It was like riding a slow horse,” Jackson, 43, told Naples News.\n\nJackson relied upon his team to uncoil the snake from around his body several times. His team included his wife, Tasha, and adopted kids, Ryker Young, 20, and Jazzlyn Bateman, 16, all of whom just the day before became certified assistants in the FWC’s Python Action Team, Removing Invasive Constrictors program.\n\nThe python wound up being the second-heaviest python ever caught in Florida at 202 pounds. The record is 215 pounds caught in 2022.\n\nJackson’s python was a 16-foot, 10-inch female, which had been carrying 200 eggs.\n\nAlso on FTW Outdoors: Woman awakes to find python on her chest, ‘don’t move’\n\n“That means more to me because that is 200 potential deer and native animal eaters [that were eliminated],” Jackson told Naples News.\n\nSince moving from Utah to hunt pythons last year, Jackson has eliminated 91 pythons, including the longest one among the contracted hunters in 2025—a 17-foot, 10-inch python.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Python drags hunter 15 feet over ant hill; ‘like riding a slow horse’",

    "description": "Vindman, a retired lieutenant colonel now challenging Republican Ashley Moody, testified before Congress about Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
    "fullText": "MIAMI — Democrat Alexander Vindman, the former National Security Council aide who helped trigger President Donald Trump’s first impeachment, announced his Senate campaign in Florida on Tuesday to challenge GOP Sen. Ashley Moody.\n\nVindman’s entrance into the race pulls Trump’s agenda and record to the forefront of the Senate contest in Florida, bringing a national focus to a race in the president’s home state — one now widely seen as Republican-leaning. Democrats have a narrow path to wrest control of the Senate in November, in which they’d have to keep all the seats they currently hold and flip four others.\n\nVindman, born in Ukraine when it was still part of the Soviet Union, was an aide on the NSC during Trump’s first term. He testified before Congress about Trump’s 2019 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the president floated an investigation of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump appeared to tie future U.S. aid to Ukraine’s willingness to launch and announce a probe that would be damaging to Biden.\n\nThe Senate acquitted Trump in that case, and Vindman, an Army combat veteran and lieutenant colonel, was fired from his position with the NSC. Vindman went on to become a vocal Trump critic, published two books and worked as a senior adviser for VoteVets, which helps to elect veterans to public office. He first floated a run for Senate in May 2025 on CBS Miami. He said at the time that he thought the 2026 midterms would be a referendum on Trump.\n\nVindman leans into his run-in with Trump in a campaign video launched Tuesday morning. “This president unleashed a reign of terror and retribution, not just against me and my family, but against all of us,” he said in the two-minute video. “Today, our country is in chaos.”\n\nThe Senate seat in Florida is up in a special election this year, and whoever wins will have to run again in 2028. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed Moody, a former state attorney general, to the Senate when Marco Rubio became Trump’s secretary of State.\n\nMoody has to run for the seat for the first time in November, and appointed senators have a history of faring less well than those who were elected. But Moody already received Trump’s endorsement and is battle-tested statewide, having won her state attorney general races twice, both times by higher margins than DeSantis’ gubernatorial wins.\n\nAny statewide Democratic candidate faces an uphill climb in Florida, given that Republican voters in the state outnumber Democratic voters by around 1.4 million people. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report also classified the Senate seat in Florida as being in the “Solid R” category — the most GOP-friendly ranking available.\n\nMoody, who comes from a prominent legal family and isn’t facing a serious GOP challenger, has Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio on her campaign team. And former Trump campaign co-chair Chris LaCivita has a key role in a super PAC supporting her election.\n\nVindman’s campaign video draws attention to affordability issues that appeared to have had an impact in the better-than-expected showing Democrats had in 2025 races. He also brought attention to higher Obamacare premiums that kicked in this year. Moody — along with most Senate Republicans — didn’t support extending enhanced subsidies for premiums, a decision GOP pollsters previously warned would be unpopular.\n\nIn his campaign video, Vindman accused Moody of having been tapped to the Senate to “be a ‘yes’ vote for Trump and the billionaires.”\n\n“She’s not Florida’s senator,” says Vindman’s narration in the campaign video. “She’s theirs.”\n\nVindman, who lives in Democratic stronghold Broward County, enters an increasingly crowded Democratic primary that includes former Brevard County school board member Jennifer Jenkins; progressive state Rep. Angie Nixon; and Hector Mujica, a Venezuelan-American candidate who previously was head of philanthropy at Google for the Americas.\n\nPolitics are also in Vindman's family. His twin brother, Eugene Vindman, was elected to represent Virginia in Congress in 2024, in the seat formerly held by now-Gov. Abigail Spanberger.",

    "description": "‘Things didn't progress the way I would have thought they would’, admitted the 79-year-old after surviving an hours-long armed stand-off with Florida police",
    "fullText": "A 79-year-old woman imprisoned for killing her terminally ill husband as part of a botched murder-suicide pact in 2023 has said she wouldn't do anything differently and is “accepting the consequences.”\n\nIt was three years ago this month that Ellen Gilland of New Smyrna Beach, Florida smuggled her husband Jerry's gun into his hospital room in Daytona Beach and fired a single, fatal shot into his head.\n\nAn hours-long standoff ensued, forcing staff and patients to shelter in place until police officers finally threw a nonlethal explosive device into the room and took Gilland into custody.\n\nA judge ultimately accepted Gilland's claim that her actions had been part of an agreement with her 77-year-old husband, but sentenced her to one year in prison and 12 years on probation due to the disruption and fear she had sown among bystanders.\n\nAsked by Fox 35 Orlando whether she would change her actions now, Gilland insisted: \"There wasn't anything else to do.\"\n\nAccording to reports, Gilland told investigators that three weeks beforehand, she and her husband Jerry — who was 77 years old — had agreed that she would kill him and then herself if his illness got worse.\n\n\"I knew what was coming. I knew how difficult it would be to be without him. Not just my best friend, but all of the things that we did for each other...,” she told Fox 35.\n\n\"In the 76 years before this event happened, I had never been in trouble before in my life, and never planned to hurt anyone ever,” she added.\n\nOf her late husband, whom she had known since middle school, she said: \"He was very supportive, very quiet, very generous. He was a lovely person.\"\n\nGilland said that she brought her husband's old gun to the hospital and sat with him talking for a while, before killing him. Afterwards, though, she found she could not go through with the suicide part of her plan.\n\nWhen hospital staff entered the room, however, Gilland — apparently in a state of extreme distress — pointed the gun at them and told them to leave, beginning an armed standoff with police.\n\n\"Tell me what's going on! I don't want to hurt you!\" one officer can be heard shouting on body cam footage.\n\n\"Things didn't progress the way I would have thought they would,\" Gilland admitted in her later interview.\n\nIn the aftermath, Gilland was initially charged with first degree murder, but her charges were reduced by a grant jury. She ultimately pled no contest to manslaughter with a firearm, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer with a firearm.\n\nOne nurse testified during her trial that he had been forced to quit his job after the killing because he \"didn't feel safe anymore\" at the hospital and regularly \"got nightmares\" due to the incident.\n\nGilland told Fox 35 that she had struggled in prison, suffering a heart attack just six weeks into her sentence due to the stress. She did the rest of her time in the infirmary, before being released in November 2025.\n\n\"Most of the guards were very — not really friendly, but accepting,\" she said. \"There were a few of them that were very rude, and shouting, and name-calling.\"\n\nNow released, Gilland is doing court-ordered community service, and will do so monthly as long as she is physically able. She has recently started working at a local animal shelter, according to Fox 35.\n\n\"I’m accepting the consequences,\" she told the outlet. \"I have to figure out how to survive after this.\"\n\nShe also told the outlet that she would try to live out the rest of her life without her husband, while advocating for some form of assisted suicide to be legalized.\n\n\"I don't want people feeling sorry for me. I did what I did,\" she said.\n\nIf you are experiencing feelings of distress, or are struggling to cope, you can speak to the Samaritans, in confidence, on 116 123 (UK and ROI), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans website to find details of your nearest branchIf you are based in the USA, and you or someone you know needs mental health assistance right now, call or text 988, or visit 988lifeline.org to access online chat from the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

    "fullText": "Sarasota (Fla.) Cardinal Mooney quarterback Davin Davidson made a splash at the Elite 11 Miami Regional earlier this month and his recruitment is now exploding.\n\nHis offer sheet has quickly expanded and Power Four programs continue to join the list. Michigan State and Louisville both offered on Monday.\n\nDavidson visited Florida over the weekend, left with an offer and was then visited by Gators head coach Jon Sumrall. Kentucky issued an offer on Sunday, while Florida State, North Carolina, Iowa, Virginia Tech, Duke and Miami led the offer avalanche last week.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 200-pounder won the accuracy challenge at the Elite 11 Regional. Invites to the Elite 11 Finals won’t sent for a while, but there’s reason to believe that he could find himself in Los Angeles this summer.\n\n“It felt good,” Davidson told Rivals’ Marcus Benjamin after the competition. “It was a fun one to compete against the best; I just had to trust my craft and get the job done.”\n\nNC State and Northwestern were the first to offer Davidson. Both got in early, but there’s plenty of competition now. Florida has quickly grabbed some momentum after offering while Davidson was on campus.\n\n“The energy was electric,” Davidson told Rivals’ Chad Simmons about his time in The Swamp. “You could feel it throughout the building.”\n\nDavidson is currently unranked in the 2027 cycle, but that will soon change.\n\nQuarterbacking Cardinal Mooney to a Florida 2A state title, Davidson had a big junior season. He threw for nearly 2,400 yards and 23 touchdowns, completing over 64 percent of his passes. He also rushed for three scores.\n\nThe Cougars went 14-2 and finished as the No. 34 team in the nation and No. 4 team in Florida, according to the Rivals Composite Rankings. Davidson will return as one of the top senior arms in the Sunshine State in 2026.",

    "description": "As Golfweek celebrates its 50th anniversary, we honor the journey from Charley Stine’s garage in Winter Haven, Florida, to becoming a global voice in golf.",
    "fullText": "I’ve often told my non-golfing friends that one of life’s greatest teases is spending an hour or two along 17-Mile Drive — that breathtaking stretch of road winding through the Monterey Peninsula. It brushes past legendary courses like Pebble Beach Golf Links, Cypress Point, Spyglass Hill, The Links at Spanish Bay, Monterey Peninsula Country Club, and Poppy Ridge.\n\nFor around 12 bucks, even those indifferent to the game can enjoy a scenic sampler of the region, leaving with a phone full of Instagram-worthy shots of some of the most stunning landscapes imaginable.\n\nBut for those of us who live to walk mist-covered fairways and strategize our way through the world’s finest golf holes, the experience is bittersweet. We leave a piece of ourselves behind, wondering if we’ll ever find the time — or the access — to check off any boxes on this nearly mythical bucket list. The slow cruise is both exhilarating and agonizing. It’s like being offered a taste of hors d'oeuvres at a Michelin-starred restaurant, only to be shown the door just as the main course begins to emerge from the kitchen.\n\nThat was exactly how I felt two decades ago, when my daily concerns revolved around the Buffalo Bills and the Sabres. I was working five nights a week as executive sports editor and lead columnist for a daily newspaper, and two more as a weekend sports anchor on the local ABC affiliate. It was a hectic, uneasy existence, shaped by a city and its struggling franchises — post-Jim Kelly, pre-Josh Allen — when the Bills were barely a blip on the national sports radar.\n\nYet every summer, my personal 17-Mile Drive would resurface. The Porter Cup rolled through town, bringing the world’s top amateur golfers to Niagara Falls Country Club. I’d mingle with rising stars like Rickie Fowler, Dustin Johnson, Jason Kokrak, Colt Knost, Gary Woodland, and more. The event took over Lewiston, N.Y., the small village where I resided. A friend who hosted players built an indoor hitting bay just for Adam Scott. One rain delay gave me unexpected hours with Billy Horschel, who walked me through the finer points of his game. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson had come through just before my time, and Max Homa and Justin Thomas followed after I’d moved on.\n\nIt was a delicious dive into a world I didn’t experience for most of the year, and when the entire circus left town after a post-tournament party in the backyard of a friend, I was always left wondering what it would be like to follow these young stars each week.\n\nBut while the golfers were the main attraction for fans, my eyes each summer turned to Ron Balicki.\n\nBorn to a family in public housing in Connecticut, Balicki spent time in Arkansas, but eventually found his way to Florida at a time when the golf scene was rapidly ramping up, and after a dozen years at the daily newspaper near Destin, he was named Golfweek’s first managing editor in 1983. While others might have used that as a means to focus solely on the pros, Balicki eventually worked his way back into the game’s grassroots, becoming a legendary college and amateur reporter.\n\nWhen Balicki died in 2014, Golfweek’s then managing editor Jeff Babineau (who has also since passed) penned these incredible paragraphs:\n\nBalicki was an ambassador, serving as Golfweek’s introductory calling card and first handshake to promising amateurs and college players. He not only got to know players, but grew close with their families, too, forging lifelong friendships. Phil Mickelson called him from Doral a few weeks ago to thank Ron for his integrity. When amateur Rickie Fowler decided that he was turning pro in 2009, he stopped mid-practice round and made the one call he knew he needed to make, phoning Balicki.\n\nHis span covering the college game dated to the powerhouse teams of Coach Dave Williams at the University of Houston in the 1980s, and he wrote a great deal about the Stanford teams of the mid-90s that included a rising star named Tiger Woods. Every young American champion of the last three decades who has risen through the amateur ranks – from Scott Verplank to Davis Love III to Mickelson to Justin Leonard to Woods to Ryan Moore to Fowler – was anointed somewhere along his early path with a story carrying a Ron Balicki byline. For years, before the Internet rolled around, he’d even keep his own stats and scribble out Golfweek’s weekly college and amateur rankings by hand on tall, yellow legal pads.\n\nRon Balicki’s story is foundational to Golfweek’s existence — not just for what he contributed to the game, but for how he did it. He was revered not for bravado, but for depth of knowledge. His legacy is built on longevity, expertise, and humility — not bombast.\n\nAs Golfweek celebrates its 50th anniversary, we honor the journey from Charley Stine’s garage in Winter Haven, Florida, to becoming a global voice in golf. Originally printed on paper, Golfweek was the lunchpail-toting publication that mirrored Balicki’s ground-up approach — building trust with players and fans alike. As Curtis Strange recently told me, “We read all the golf publications, but we couldn’t wait to get to Golfweek — to see the stats from every amateur event and compare ourselves with other players. We had to have it.”\n\nFive decades later, the spirit of Balicki, Babineau, Stine, and others who shaped this publication lives on. It’s reflected in Cameron Jourdan’s extensive amateur golf coverage, Jason Lusk’s deep dives into courses, David Dusek’s exhaustive equipment testing, and Eamon Lynch’s incisive columns. And while Beth Ann Nichols and Adam Schupak lead our extensive pro tour coverage, Golfweek remains committed to celebrating the entire game — not just when the purses are biggest.\n\nThese relationships endure. I was reminded of that at this year’s Valero Texas Open, when Brian Harman lit up recalling his 2007 Porter Cup win — a record-setting performance that still tops the event's all-time leaderboard. Or when I heard a touching story from the family who housed Horschel during his amateur days near my hometown. Soon after the family patriarch passed away, Horschel won the 2014 FedEx Cup, a moment that changed his career’s trajectory. Yet he found the time to quickly text them a photo of the trophy, adding, “This one’s for your dad.”\n\nGolfweek’s 50th anniversary isn’t just a milestone — it’s a tribute to the relationships, stories, and spirit that have defined the publication for half a century. And it’s a promise that those values will continue to guide us into the next.\n\nTim Schmitt is the managing editor of Golfweek, and has just two of the 17-Mile Drive courses crossed off his list.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Golfweek at 50: Relationships still matter",

Instead, the DeLand, Florida resident was left with a repair bill of nearly $20,000.\n\nGerdauskas took her Mercedes to a Take 5 Oil Change location in October, expecting to be in and out quickly. Instead, she says a technician mistakenly drained her transmission fluid rather than her engine oil and let her drive away.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThe trouble started within minutes.\n\n“It was shifting by itself. So, it was like trying to go into reverse and neutral as I’m driving down the road,” she told WFTV’s Action 9 Consumer Investigator (1).\n\nGerdauskas immediately took the car back to the shop, where workers acknowledged the error.\n\nBut what followed was a familiar and often pricey consumer dispute: Who’s responsible when routine maintenance goes wrong?\n\nAccording to Gerdauskas, her dealership later determined the vehicle had been driven with no transmission fluid, which can cause serious internal damage to the car. The estimated cost to replace the transmission and complete all the related work totaled more than $18,000.\n\nTake 5 told Action 9 that it paid for a transmission flush but closed the claim after the dealership said the transmission did not need to be replaced.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerdauskas said she was told the transmission would eventually fail.\n\n“My transmission was not damaged before it entered their shop,” she said, “Just pay for the damage you did.”\n\nIn a statement, the company said that while cases like Gerdauskas’ are rare, they “strive to resolve matters fairly and transparently”. But her case isn’t as unique as it seems.\n\nAction 9 found similar complaints nationwide involving Take 5.\n\nWFTV’s sister station in Charlotte, North Carolina, spoke with Ben Brown in 2025 after a visit to Take 5. He said he pulled over, opened the oil reservoir and smoke was coming out. His car ultimately needed a new engine.\n\nIn Georgia, Robin Porterfield reported a similar experience. She said technicians drained her oil but never refilled it before sending her on her way.",

    "fullText": "The world of football witnessed another curious episode last Thursday (22).\n\nCoach Lúcio Flávio, who had arrived at Goiatuba with hopes of reviving the team in the 2026 Campeonato Goiano, requested to leave the club after leading the squad for just one round (four days of work).\n\nThe 46-year-old coach released a video announcing his departure and stating that he had accepted a new job offer — he was announced at Uberlândia, in Minas Gerais.\n\nA former midfielder who emerged at Paraná in the late 1990s, Lúcio Flávio played for major clubs in Brazilian football, such as Internacional, São Paulo, Coritiba, Atlético-MG, Vitória, and Santos.\n\nHowever, the club with which he is most closely identified is Botafogo, where he played between 2007 and 2008 and then again from 2009 to 2010.\n\nRetired from the pitch since 2017, Lúcio Flávio began his coaching career as an assistant at Paraná the following year.\n\nHe later served as assistant and interim coach at Botafogo between 2020 and 2023. The young coach also had stints at Aparecidense, São Joseense, and Brasiliense before arriving at Goiatuba at the start of the Goianão.\n\nAt Goiatuba, the team’s situation in the 2026 Campeonato Goiano was already difficult before Lúcio Flávio’s arrival.\n\nThe “Azulão do Sul” started the state championship with another coach, Augusto Fassina, who was dismissed after three winless matches.\n\nLúcio Flávio led the team in just one match, and with only one point on the table, the club remains at the bottom of the competition. The team still has four games ahead to try to escape relegation and dream of a spot among the top eight in the state championship.\n\nMeanwhile, Uberlândia is also going through a tough time. Before the coach’s arrival, the “Verdão” had two losses and two draws in four matches, sitting at the bottom of Group A in the Campeonato Mineiro.\n\nIn four games, the team has yet to win, suffered a 5-0 thrashing by Cruzeiro, and faces challenges ahead as they try to climb out of last place in their group in the state championship.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Florida faces a frigid Winnipeg and a resurgent Jets team. Can the Panthers heat up on their lengthy road journey?",
    "fullText": "The Florida Panthers are back on the road again.\n\nAfter a brief stop in South Florida for Monday’s matchup with the San Jose Sharks, the Panthers boarded a plane on Wednesday bound for the great white north.\n\nAssuming they can defrost, Florida will kick off a three-game road trip Thursday when they face the Winnipeg Jets at Canada Life Centre.\n\nHopefully the Cats brought their fur layers, as the temperature on Thursday in Winnipeg has a high of minus-17 and a low of minus-22.\n\nWhen they eventually hit the ice, Florida will be playing against a Jets squad that is desperately trying to bounce back from an atrocious stretch that took up most of November and December.\n\nAfter winning nine of their first 12 games, the Jets went into a tailspin that peaked with an 11-game losing streak that ran from mid-December to early January.\n\nThey went from a strong 9-3-0 start to the season to holding a 15-22-5 mark on Jan. 8 (that’s a 6-19-5 run for those wondering).\n\nSince ending the losing streak, Winnipeg has seemingly turned a corner, going 5-1-1 over the past couple weeks.\n\nThey will face a Florida squad that is also trying to make up ground and viewing every potential point in the standings as crucial.\n\nIt helps that the Panthers are getting healthier, welcoming Matthew Tkachuk into the lineup for the first time on Monday against San Jose.\n\nWith Tkachuk back in the fold, it’s just a matter of time before Florida’s forward ranks become as potent as they’ve been all season, which will happen when Brad Marchand is cleared to return.\n\n“He’s certainly close, day-to-day,” Maurice said of Marchand, who has missed six straight games with an undisclosed injury. “Whether it happens on this road trip, I don’t know yet. We are just kind of building off how he comes in each day. He felt better today than he maybe expected to (after) he got through practice. So we’ll need him to wake up tomorrow at least, and then probably the next day, before we start feeling that he’s right there.”\n\nFor Maruice, any time Florida returns to Winnipeg, it’s a special night for him.\n\nMaurice spent nine seasons coaching the Jets, leading them to the playoffs five times.\n\n“I do look forward to it,” Maurice said of returning to Winnipeg. “There’s great memories in that place, so it’s a fun trip.”\n\nSince joining the Panthers in 2022, Maurice has yet to see Florida pick up a victory in his old stomping grounds, going 0-3-0 in Winnipeg by a combined score of 14-5.\n\n“I don’t know if we’ve ever won in there,” Maurice said with a smile. “Other than the final scores, it’s been good.”\n\nHere are the Panthers projected lines and pairings for Thursday’s tussle in Winnipeg:\n\nEetu Luostarinen – Anton Lundell – Sam Reinhart\n\nCarter Verhaeghe – Sam Bennett – Matthew Tkachuk\n\nMackie Samoskevich – Evan Rodrigues – A.J. Greer\n\nSandis Vilmanis – Luke Kunin – Jesper Boqvist\n\nLATEST STORIES FROM THE HOCKEY NEWS - FLORIDA\n\nSeth Jones replaced on Team USA Olympic roster due to injury\n\nPanthers' Niko Mikkola Exits Game Early, Misses Practice But Is Still Expected To Play Against The Jets\n\nPanthers local TV viewership numbers continue to rise\n\nAs Panthers get healthier, salary cap could be major obstacle in Florida suiting up its full roster\n\n'We loved it,' Panthers Players Discuss Sergei Bobrovsky's Goalie Fight With Sharks' Alex Nedeljkovic",

    "description": "Nashville SC played the Chicago Fire in its first preseason match of 2026, losing 4-1 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.",
    "fullText": "Nashville SC played soccer for the first time in more than two months. And though the result doesn't line up with the club's high expectations for 2026, it's a secondary concern for coach B.J. Callaghan.\n\nNashville lost 4-1 to the Chicago Fire on Jan. 20 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida in its first preseason game ahead of what might be its most anticipated MLS season ever. Although the match was 90 minutes, starters played for only about half an hour, with backups and players from Huntsville City FC getting the rest of the action.\n\n\"For us, it's more about setting clear objectives of what we worked on this week,\" Callaghan said. \"Being clear with how we're going to evaluate in the game, which would be on certain objectives, a couple phases of play that we were focused on.\"\n\nHere are additional takeaways from the game against the Fire, as well as Nashville's first week of the preseason.\n\nNashville SC arrived in Florida on Jan. 12 and will play four of its six preseason matches there, with the next against the Colorado Rapids on Jan. 23. The team will practice in Nashville for a week ahead of an exhibition at USL club Birmingham Legion on Jan. 31, go back to Florida for two more games and finally face Lexington SC in Nashville on Feb. 14, two days before its CONCACAF Champions Cup opening match at Atletico Ottawa.\n\nNashville dealt with several injuries in its past two preseason training camps, but Callaghan said the team is almost fully healthy, with only one player, Huntsville forward Alioune Ka, sitting out against the Fire.\n\nThat doesn't mean Nashville would be ready to play a competitive game tomorrow.\n\n\"The fitness component is getting there,\" Callaghan said. \"It's growing in the right direction, but we're not where we need to be. We're not 90-minute fit for sure. But it's intentional, and we're gonna build through this preseason.\"\n\nNashville's first MLS game is Feb. 21 against the New England Revolution at Geodis Park (7:30 p.m. CT).\n\nMORE: Nashville SC signals MLS championship aspirations with Cristian Espinoza\n\nNashville's starting lineup looked like a full-strength group. Brian Schwake started at goalkeeper, while new signing Maxwell Woledzi paired with Jeisson Palacios at center back. Dan Lovitz and Andy Najar started at left and right back, respectively.\n\nEdvard Tagseth and Patrick Yazbek held down central midfield, with Alex Muyl and Cristian Espinoza playing on the wings and Hany Mukhtar and Sam Surridge up front in attack.\n\nCallaghan said Nashville started out in the 4-2-2-2 formation, which was its primary setup in 2025. While that remained the base throughout the 90 minutes, Nashville tweaked that shape at different moments.\n\nEspinoza, the club's newest designated player, worked for the first time with the other two DPs, Mukhtar and Surridge. The trio didn't produce any goals, but created a few opportunities, according to Callaghan.\n\n\"They bring different dynamics, whether it's playing between the lines, running behind, being able to get service,\" Callaghan said. \"It's about creating that connection, that chemistry between those three. But at the same time, it's also making sure that we're well dialed-in on the defensive side.\"\n\nMidfielder Charles-Emile Brunet scored Nashville's lone goal on a long shot during the third and final shift, which consisted largely of trialists and draft picks. Brunet was Nashville's third-round pick in December's MLS SuperDraft out of SMU.\n\nJacob Shames can be reached by email at jshames@gannett.com and on X/Twitter @Jacob_Shames.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nashville Tennessean: Nashville SC MLS preseason takeaways, what we learned",

    "description": "Celebrities are flocking to Florida. Here's why everyone from David Beckham to Sylvester Stallone has moved to the Sunshine State.",
    "fullText": "Florida has always been an appealing destination for movers, thanks to its lack of income tax and great weather. Celebrities have often found their way there for vacations or second homes, but in recent years, more high-end buyers are putting down more serious roots in the Sunshine State.\n\nSuperstar athlete Lionel Messi, for instance, made his way to Florida after leaving Barcelona. Actors like Sylvester Stallone, one of the many Hollywood stars who've left California, also opted to make Florida his new home base.\n\nAnd while international celebrity moves aren't all that surprising, there's also been a new crop of mover: ultrawealthy business and tech icons.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Miami tried to establish itself as the third coast for tech behind San Francisco and New York, and the city was able to lure some large players, from startup founders to investment firm CEOs.\n\nThe realignment of wealth has made some regions more popular than they were previously, but Florida, especially, has emerged as a great place to call home for the wealthy.\n\nBusiness Insider rounded up 15 celebrities and business leaders who have left various parts of the country to establish themselves — and, in some cases, their businesses — in sunny Florida, presented in alphabetical order by last name.\n\nThe \"Happy Days\" and \"Charles in Charge\" actor posted on X in May 2023 that he was leaving California after 45 years, citing the homeless issue in LA County.\n\n\"Florida is pretty much what America was like 50 years ago,\" Baio told Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo weeks after the post. \"It's just people hanging out. Everything's wide open, it's free, the people that I meet are all just nice.\"\n\nRetired soccer great David Beckham is spending more time in Miami these days.\n\nHe and his wife, Victoria Beckham, bought a $24 million, five-bedroom condo in 2020 that features a swimming pool and rooftop helipad. The couple moved to Miami after Beckham became co-owner and president of the Major League Soccer team Inter Miami CF.\n\n\"Miami is the gateway to the Americas, embracing people from all over the world, and Inter Miami CF was built to bring world-class football to this world-class city,\" Beckham wrote on his website of his interest in owning Inter Miami.\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos bought a $68 million mansion in Biscayne Bay in August 2023. Two months later, he bought a seven-bedroom house next door for $79 million. In April, he bought another property in Florida — this time for $90 million.\n\nBezos said he was leaving Seattle, where his company is headquartered, for Miami to be closer to his parents and to the operations of the aerospace company he also founded, Blue Origin.\n\n\"I've lived in Seattle longer than I've lived anywhere else and have so many amazing memories here,\" Bezos said in an Instagram post. \"As exciting as the move is, it's an emotional decision for me.\"\n\nAfter signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020, and winning a Super Bowl with the team before he retired from the NFL in 2023, Brady has stayed put in Florida.\n\nFirst, he was living in a 1.2-acre mansion during his time as a Buccaneer while married to Gisele Bündchen (it was once owned by Derek Jeter).\n\nSince his divorce, he's moved to Miami. The bachelor pad features floor-to-ceiling windows and an indoor/outdoor living space with a fireplace and pool, according to snapshots he's shared on Instagram.\n\n\"I was a native Californian for a long time in my life, went away from it for about 25 years, and you won't catch me dead living in the Northeast anymore,\" Brady said in 2020, referencing his time as a New England Patriot. \"I'm loving the warm weather, and it's been a great feeling.\"\n\nThe king of \"Flavortown\" has spent most of his career on the West Coast, having gone to college in Las Vegas and building his restaurant empire in California. Now, as one of the major food personalities in the world and with his children growing up, he's thinking of the next chapter in his life.\n\nFieri bought a waterfront home near West Palm Beach in 2023 for $7.3 million, according to The Palm Beach Post.\n\nThe estate has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, 6,621 square feet of indoor living space, and a 5-foot infinity pool. Its 230-foot frontage on the Intracostal Waterway has enough room to dock a 100-foot yacht.\n\n\"Even a cloudy day in Florida is an awesome day,\" he said while opening up one of his Chicken Guy chains in Winter Park, Florida in 2023. \"I will be in Florida way more than you know.\"\n\nKen Griffin founded the investment firm Citadel in 1990 in Chicago but has since ditched the Windy City for the warmer climate of Miami.\n\nGriffin not only moved his firm — which has about $58 billion in assets managed — to Florida, he moved himself. He plans on building a $1 billion office for the new Citadel headquarters and isn't skimping on his own digs either.\n\nIn 2022, Griffin bought a waterfront property for more than $106 million, breaking the previous record (which he set himself the year before, after buying a home on Star Island for $75 million).\n\nJosh Kushner, venture capitalist and brother to Jared Kushner, left Manhattan for a $23.5 million property in Miami Beach in 2020.\n\nKushner and his wife, model Karlie Kloss, moved into an eight-bedroom, 14,000-square-foot mansion on a waterfront lot.\n\nAccording to Architectural Digest, Kushner and Kloss bought another property in Manhattan in 2021, but property records show they still own their home in Miami Beach.\n\nThree years after taking the team, David Beckham acquired arguably the world's greatest soccer player.\n\nLionel Messi signed on to play for Inter Miami CF in 2023, and when he's not on the pitch, he enjoys his $10.75 million waterfront mansion in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe 10,500-square-foot two-story house has 10 bedrooms, nine bathrooms, two docks, and 170 feet of water frontage, according to the Miami Herald.\n\n\"It has been very easy, very easy,\" Messi said at a 2023 press conference about adapting to his new surroundings in Miami. \"We were convinced we wanted to come here, and the people made it very easy, the people in the club and the people I see day to day in the streets and the amazing city, it makes living here very easy and happy.\"\n\nIn 2021, WeWork cofounder Adam Neumann sold his Bay Area compound for $22.4 million and bought two properties in Miami.\n\nNeumann bought two adjacent properties totaling 50,000 square feet for $44 million. The waterfront properties are located in an exclusive part of Miami Beach.\n\nCome November 2026, Californians will vote to impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth in California. Google cofounder Larry Page wasn't going to chance it, and reportedly bought two properties in Miami's Coconut Grove neighborhood.\n\nThe proposed bill would retroactively tax billionaires living in California as of January 1. Page, whose net worth is $269 billion, purchased his first Florida property in December 2025.\n\nPage's two properties are worth upward of $170 million and are less than a mile apart. He also moved his businesses out of the Golden State.\n\nBillionaire and hedge-fund manager Larry Robbins is leaving New York City, but he's not bringing his company with him.\n\nRobbins, the CEO of Glenview Capital Management, bought a home in Palm Beach Gardens for $13.9 million earlier in 2024, according to The Real Deal.\n\nUnlike other bosses who are moving their operations with them, Bloomberg reported that Robbins will keep the fund in New York while he commutes back and forth.\n\nJudge Judy Sheindlin has been enjoying the Sunshine State for some time. For years, she and her husband have lived in Naples.\n\nAt one time, they owned an 8,550-square-foot condo with two private elevators and a sauna but put it on the market in 2015.\n\nShe then moved into a 10,000-square-foot mansion about a mile away that overlooks a man-made lake.\n\nIn 2022, a month after the devastation of Hurricane Ian through Florida, Sheindlin told \"Good Morning America\" that she lost a couple of cars due to the storm, but that wouldn't stop her from going back to Florida.\n\n\"We kissed goodbye a couple of cars, which went floating,\" she said. \"But, generally speaking, we were luckier than most people down in Florida. And we're hoping to get back before the season ends.\"\n\nAfter decades of living in Los Angeles, the iconic actor packed up for Florida in 2023.\n\nThe move was revealed in early 2024, when season two of his reality series, \"The Family Stallone,\" aired.\n\n\"After a long, hard consideration, your mother and I have decided, time to move on and leave the state of California permanently, and we're going to go to Florida,\" Stallone told his kids. \"We're going to sell this house.\"\n\nStallone and his wife, Jennifer Flavin, gave multiple reasons for the relocation, including the desire for a fresh start after their children moved out of the family home.\n\nThe legendary shock jock spent decades living it up in the Hamptons, and now he's doing the same in Florida.\n\nStern bought the massive 20,000-square-foot oceanfront property in Palm Beach in 2013 for a reported $52 million.\n\nThe property is so desirable that in April, rumors spread that Jeff Bezos bought Stern's estate for $300 million. However, Page Six later reported that the rumors were false and that Stern even told the billionaire his place wasn't for sale.\n\n\"New York is the center of the world,\" Stern once told listeners of his show in 2015. \"Why wouldn't everyone just move to Florida and build a New York there? I don't get it.\"\n\nFormer president Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, reportedly spent $30 million in December 2020 on a waterfront lot on Indian Creek Island — a gated community home to a handful of celebrities.\n\nWhen they bought the property, the home was billed as a \"fixer-upper,\" and they spent years on renovations.\n\nAfter leaving Washington, DC, but before moving into their new home, the couple rented a condo tower, Arte Tower, in Surfside, Florida, about a mile from their property.",

    "fullText": "An 80-year old man survived 18 hours at sea after his boat drifted while he was spearfishing\n\nIgnacio Siberio told PEOPLE in a 2005 interview that the experience was \"terrible\"\n\n\"I realized the only way I was going to make it... was with my mind,\" he said shortly after his rescue\n\nIgnacio Siberio was 80 years old when he sailed his 25-foot boat about seven miles off the Florida Keys to go spearfishing. It was Dec. 11, 2005 and Siberio was a practicing civil attorney and a skilled spearfisher who often went in the water with his nephew.\n\nWhen his nephew couldn't make it that day, he opted to go alone, even as gusty winds and choppy water threatened to derail the experience.\n\nSpeaking to PEOPLE a few months later, Siberio acknowledged, \"I shouldn't have been there.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nSiberio dove into the ocean with his speargun, hunting for three hours before deciding to head home. When he surfaced, his boat was gone — a casualty of a storm front that had dislodged its anchors.\n\nSiberio could see the boat in the distance — attempting to swim after it for several hours — but could not quite catch up.\n\n\"It was terrible,\" he told PEOPLE.\n\nAt that point, exhausted, Siberio began treading water, worrying that he would \"be swept into the Straits of Florida,\" he said.\n\nOne hour of treading water later, though, he spotted five one-foot-long buoys floating together — swimming to them and holding on as tight as he could. As the temperatures dropped overnight, he tried to relax, telling PEOPLE later: \"I realized the only way I was going to make it... was with my mind.\"\n\nUnbeknownst to Siberio, his nephew and a friend had already begun a frantic search, enlisting the Coast Guard to boat to his favorite fishing spots.\n\nEarly the morning after he first got separated from his boat, they found him: Siberio had cut the buoys and wrapped them around himself. He was swimming towards the shore.\n\nSiberio was pulled into the rescue vessel about 18 hours after he first realized he was lost at sea. He was then brought him to his Tavernier, Fla., home (he refused a hospital visit), and greeted by loved ones led by his wife, Gloria, then 68.\n\nAs PEOPLE reported at the time, the incident did little to quell his love for fishing, and he had already been several times in the months immediately after.\n\n\"My lesson is you have to be careful,\" he told PEOPLE. \"Fortunately I was able to bring happiness instead of sadness by coming home.\"\n\nSpeaking to CBC radio following his rescue, Siberio noted that fate seemed to be on his side.\n\n\"The buoy that I got hold of to stay all night had my date of birth,\" he told the outlet. \"I was born in July 31st, and the buoy had the number 731. Can you imagine that?\"",

    "description": "ACA subsidies expiring leaves 1.4 million fewer insured compared to 2025, as CMS data shows enrollment declines in Florida and other Southern states.",
    "fullText": "The disappearance of Affordable Care Act subsidies has millions of households feeling health insurance sticker shock.\n\nA report published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid found that there are 1.4 million fewer people enrolled in insurance through ACA marketplaces this month compared to January 2025. States like Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and Georgia saw the most significant dips.\n\n\"People have less access to care, and that tends to translate into worse health outcomes,\" said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution. He added that many households' financial security is at risk: \"People will face big bills that they either can't pay, and that hurts their credit. Or they do pay, but it requires them to skimp in other areas.\"\n\nBusiness Insider broke down the enrollment changes by state — and spoke with experts about why this CMS data doesn't yet tell the whole story of marketplace enrollment in 2026.\n\nThe number of marketplace enrollees declined most significantly in the South and Southeast, though the majority of states reported a downswing. Florida saw enrollment dive by more than 260,000 people. Registration in a few states, like Texas and California, increased.\n\nPeople might opt for a marketplace plan if their employer doesn't offer coverage, if they're self-employed, if they lose their job, or if their income is too high to qualify for Medicaid. In context, the 1.4 million dip this year is notable: Marketplace enrollment had jumped from 11 to over 24 million between 2015 and 2025.\n\nThe enhanced ACA subsidies — which were passed in 2021 and expired on December 31 — made health insurance more affordable for lower- and middle-income Americans. They allowed people with incomes up to 400% of the poverty line (which is $128,600 annually for a family of four) to claim relief on healthcare costs.\n\nA KFF estimate found that, without these credits in place, Americans in the marketplace could see their out-of-pocket premium costs more than double compared to last year.\n\nWhite House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that \"ACA enrollment declined by 3.5 percent between 2025 and 2026 — entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans.\"\n\nEfforts to renew these credits were a point of contention between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, contributing to the latest government shutdown. Lawmakers opted not to renew the subsidies in December, and the latest ACA vote is stalled in the Senate until late January.\n\nRepublicans have said they aim to reach a compromise healthcare strategy, but a plan President Donald Trump released on January 15 does not mention subsidies. The plan lays out the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums, implement cost-sharing programs, and increase cost transparency.\n\n\"The basic contour of the plan is contradictory,\" said Gideon Lukens, senior fellow and director of research and data analysis at the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. \"Much less the question of how this would work, who would get what, and why this is better than directly covering people's premiums to prevent the spikes millions of people are facing right now.\"\n\nPolicy analysts told Business Insider they expect a steeper decline in ACA enrollment over the next few months. The January report is a snapshot of the marketplace landscape, but comes with caveats.\n\nThe latest data shows how many Americans selected a marketplace plan during open enrollment or were automatically renewed for their existing ACA coverage. It doesn't capture how many people have paid their health insurance premiums, meaning that more people are likely to drop coverage once they start receiving bills. A recent Congressional Budget Office report estimates that nearly 4 million Americans will lose or drop insurance over the next decade.\n\n\"Many likely signed up when the premiums they would end up facing were uncertain and then waited to see what they would have to pay,\" said Matthew Buettgens, a senior fellow at The Urban Institute.\n\nFor the few states where enrollment spiked, Fielder theorized that local healthcare policy is a factor. California offers its own ACA subsidies, for example, so residents are less vulnerable to the federal changes.\n\nBesides the direct impact on patients, Fielder also said the lapse of ACA credits could put more pressure on hospitals, because providers could see an influx of uninsured patients, and people would be less likely to seek care in the first place.\n\n\"There will be facilities that were already financially fragile for whom this is the straw that breaks the camel's back,\" he said.",

    "description": "Larry Page, Google cofounder, moves major assets and residence from California to Florida as the Billionaire Tax Act targets ultrawealthy residents.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page recently drew his line in the sand on a beach on the opposite side of California — and it cost him over $170 million.\n\nCalifornia has proposed the Billionaire Tax Act, which would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth over $1 billion. Page, whose net worth is $269 billion as of January according to Forbes, isn't giving California the option to tax him and is deserting the Golden State for a state on the opposite extreme of taxing the wealthy: Florida.\n\nThe proposed bill, which doesn't appear on the ballot until November, would retroactively tax billionaires living in California as of January 1. Conveniently, Page reportedly located a Florida residence just before then.\n\nPage purchased a 4.5-acre compound in Miami's glamorous Coconut Grove neighborhood in December 2025 for $101.5 million, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Miami-Dade County property records show late restaurateur Jonathan Lewis previously owned the property.\n\nAnd for good measure, property records show a trust linked to Page bought another property — less than a mile away from the other — for $71.9 million in January this year. The trust, Tropical Frontier Revocable Trust, lists Florida attorney Benjamin Babcock and Mary McFadden Quisenberry, the chief operating officer of Palo Alto, California-based Rosewood Family Advisors, as trustees. Babcock declined to comment on the transaction.\n\nTax filings from Page's family foundation, the Carl Victor Page Memorial Foundation, show Rosewood Family Advisors provided tax and accounting services for the foundation in 2024. Rosewood Family Advisors could not be reached for comment.\n\nPage also filed to move a number of his businesses from California to Delaware, Florida, and Texas, Business Insider reported earlier this year.\n\nAn agent involved in the $101.5-million transaction, Danny Hertzberg of The Jills Zeder Group, declined to comment on this particular deal. He said wealthy Californians have been lining up to buy homes in Florida recently.\n\n\"We started feeling an impact, let's say in early December, which really picked up going to the end of the year,\" Hertzberg told Business Insider. \"California's dominating the high end of the market. The market right now, in terms of offers and active buyers, has a huge California presence, and it's directly related to 5% net worth.\"\n\nWealthy people moving to South Florida isn't a new trend, though some of the most recent residents made large splashes. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, arguably, became the most notable Florida mover after building his own compound on an exclusive island in Miami's Biscayne Bay.\n\nSouth Florida tried a somewhat rebrand in the early 2020s as the Silicon Valley of the East and did attract some movers. This latest shift has serious legs and the potential to change the perception of South Florida, according to Hertzberg.\n\n\"All of the movement I've seen from California is primary residences — people putting roots down and planning to be here,\" Hertzberg said. \"I think that may push along an already strong existing trend as Miami emerges as a major destination for finance and tech.\"\n\n\"With the level and caliber of people that are looking, that have already acquired properties here, and that are moving here, I do think, on the overall business perspective of Miami, it's already one of the major players in the country, if not the world,\" Hertzberg added. \"And it's going to be elevated as one of the premier destinations for those industries of finance, tech, and everything related.\"",

    "fullText": "You can find original article here Nrn. \n\nSailormen Inc., a Miami-based Popeyes franchisee with more than 130 restaurants in its portfolio, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Southern District of Florida.&nbsp;\n\nIn its filing, the company estimated it had about $130 million in debt. The company said it has “faced significant challenges” throughout the past year leading to its financial struggles, including rising operational costs due to inflation and increased borrowing expenses, higher wages, and consumer behavior changes since the pandemic that drove lower traffic.\n\nAdditionally, in late 2023, Sailormen entered into an agreement with a buyer, Tar Heels Spice, to sell 16 of its Georgia restaurants as part of a restructuring plan. That deal fell through, however, further straining the company’s finances. Sailormen stopped covering rent for the locations in April 2024 and then filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Tar Heels Spice in August 2024.&nbsp;\n\nFurther, the company’s primary lender, BMO Bank, filed a lawsuit in December for breach of contract against Sailormen related to the franchisee’s loan obligations. In that complaint, BMO is seeking a court-appointed receiver to take control of Sailormen and its assets, which was the catalyst for the Chapter 11 filing. Sailormen said its stakeholders “will fare better” because of the filing.\n\nSailormen ended 2025 with more than $233 million in sales and a net operating loss of nearly $19 million.&nbsp;\n\nThis filing comes on the heels of a relatively soft year for the chain, including -2% same-store sales in the most recently reported third quarter. Those results followed a 0.9% decline in same-store sales in Q2, and -4% in Q1.&nbsp;In 2024, however, Popeyes sales were up nearly 4%, while the company has increased its sales by nearly 20% since 2021.&nbsp;\n\nSeveral concepts have filed bankruptcy already, less than a month into 2026, illustrating a market rife with challenges such as higher cost inputs and slower consumer usage. Over the past six weeks, concepts including Pieology Pizza, Taste of Belgium, Ray Ray’s Hog Pit, and Compass Coffee have all filed for protection.&nbsp;\n\nContact Alicia Kelso at Alicia.Kelso@informa.com\n\nFollow her on TikTok: @aliciakelso",

    "description": "For the first time in the 12-year history of the CFP, both starting QBs in the title game hail from Florida high schools. But it’s not just the quarterbacks.",
    "fullText": "For the first time in the 12-year history of the CFP, both starting QBs in the title game hail from Florida high schools. But it’s not just the quarterbacks. What’s even more intriguing is that 58 players in the National Championship were born in Florida, which is a blueprint that the new head coach, Jon Sumrall, cannot ignore.\n\n“Florida breeds football,” wrote Hard Rock Bet, Florida’s only legal sports book, sharing a collage of all Florida-born players on Thursday.\n\nBoth star performers, Fernando Mendoza and Carson Beck, hail from Florida but from different cities. This signals that coach Sumrall needs to focus on recruiting local talent to build a title-winning roster for the Gators. This past season, Florida endured a rough 4–8 campaign, prompting the hiring of Jon Sumrall to get the program back on track.\n\nPrograms dominating with homegrown talent justify the importance of retaining local players. In fact, Georgia, under Kirby Smart, did the same thing in 2024-25. They kept most of their roster from Georgia high schools, which paid off with back-to-back titles and a 2025 playoff run.\n\nWhile Jon Sumrall has already added proven talent. The Gators have secured commitments from Auburn WR Eric Singleton Jr., PSU OT Eagan Boyer, and OL T.J. Shanahan Jr., UCF LB TJ Bullard, Georgia Tech OL Harrison Moore and QB Aaron Philo, and more. Meanwhile, the program has also lost nearly 20 players to the transfer portal, including star QB DJ Lagway.\n\nFilling gaps is now essential. But Sumrall’s 2026 roster shows a chance to return the Gators to the glory days of 2008, when they defeated Oklahoma to win the BCS National Championship.\n\nThe 2026 roster features plenty of Florida-born talent, including Bryce Lovett, Dallas Wilson, Jamari Lyons, TJ Abrams, Cormani McClain, and more. While this year’s national championship clearly shows Florida players have football in their blood, the 2026 roster only needs Sumrall’s guidance to turn that talent into execution.\n\nNow, while Sumrall prioritizes retention and has proven his ability to develop talent at its best, something he already showed at Tulane, it’s time for the Gators to step into the spotlight under his leadership. The HC has already hit the ground running at Florida, making roster retention his top priority. That’s probably why key players, like running back Jadan Baugh, quickly re-signed after meeting with him.\n\n“Future Gators matter, sure, but current Gators matter more,” he said.\n\nWhile his mantra is simple: production over pedigree, at Troy and Tulane, he turned unranked and two-star recruits into NFL-ready talent. Now, Florida hopes he can work the same magic in Gainesville. While both teams boast Florida-born talent, which has the better chance to win? Oddsmakers favor Indiana to take the national championship, yet the Miami Nation hasn’t given up hope.\n\nThe Hurricanes are gearing up to face the Hoosiers for the National Championship on January 19, and the excitement is electric. Here, fans and alumni are buzzing, drawing comparisons to past glory days.\n\nRoderick Carter, a former LB and 1987 national champion, sees echoes of his team in this year’s squad.\n\n“It brings me back to the glory days. Brings me back to where we were competing at a high level,” said Carter.\n\nNow a behavior coach and case manager in Palm Beach County, Carter isn’t worried about the doubters.\n\n“I know there’s a lot of analysis and experts thinking Miami is going to come up short. I just think that we have what it takes, you know, to be victorious come Monday night,” he added.\n\nJust like that, the sentiment is clear: this team has talent and the hunger to win. But on the flip side, fans are riding the wave of momentum from the Fiesta Bowl, where Miami defeated Ole Miss in style.\n\n“I think our defense has been really great this year. Our defense and our offense—we have some really talented players; Malachi Toney has been killing it. Shout out to him. He’s amazing,” said Canes fan Daniela Battisti.\n\nWith the last national title in 2001, many current supporters weren’t even born then, but the spirit of the ‘U’ is alive and roaring.\n\nThe post 2026 National Championship Spotlight Offers a Lesson Jon Sumrall Can’t Afford to Ignore as Gators HC appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Authorities in central Florida have arrested a young couple, charging them with neglect after their newborn twin babies had to be hospitalized.\n\nMadison Smith, 23 and Leroy Somersall III, 24, live in Sanford, Florida, where police have charged them with child neglect with great bodily harm.\n\nPolice said the twin babies — a boy and a girl, born five months ago — were taken to the hospital on January 6 after one was found unresponsive. While there, medical staff quickly realized the twins were severely in a malnourished state and extremely dehydrated.\n\nHospital officials called police and told them the infants' bones were showing, and that their abdomens had sunken in, according to arrest documents obtained by Us Weekly. The brother and sister, whose names were redacted in court records, weighed only 5.7 pounds at the time of their hospital admission.\n\nThe baby boy actually weighed more when he was discharged from the hospital after his birth, it is alleged in the arrest report.\n\nBoth babies were \"thin and frail\" in appearance, and had low blood sugar levels, according to the arrest reports. Nurses also told police the babies seemed \"very sick, underfed, and malnourished.\"\n\nThe arrest report notes the twins were born a month prematurely, and that Smith had tested positive for THC while the babies were in utero.\n\nParents Busted in South Carolina After 5-Month-Old Dies in Suspected Child Abuse Case\n\n\"There are concerns that the children are not being fed properly,\" read the arrest report, which noted the couple have a \"history\" of complaints lodged against them with the department of Children and Families.\n\nThe reports claim Child Protective Services received a tip about possible abuse of the twins.\n\nSpeaking to police at the hospital, the couple allegedly claimed they were not advised by health care professionals about the need to feed babies more as they develop and acknowledged that they provided the twins with minimal amounts of formula, because they were newly born.\n\nBut during a search of the couple's RV, police allegedly found no formula on hand. Also missing from the RV and the trash can were empty containers of formula, police alleged.\n\nThe police report alleges the two babies started gaining weight between January 6 and Sunday, January 11, as the hospital staff had been feeding them regularly.\n\n\"Hospital staff have expressed that both children are expected to survive,\" according to the arrest reports, which claim one of the two children is suffering from an unspecified neurological condition.\n\nThe couple was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday, January 13. It was unclear what the outcome of that initial hearing was. Us Weekly was trying to confirm if the couple had entered pleas or were represented by counsel.\n\nIf you suspect child abuse, please call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child or 1-800-422-4453, or visit ChildHelp.org. All calls are toll-free and confidential, and the hotline is available 24/7 in more than 170 languages.",

    "description": "Nicknamed \"Venice of America,\" Florida's Fort Lauderdale isn't quite a dupe for the Italian city, but there are great things to do if you visit.",
    "fullText": "I've lived in Miami for nearly a decade, and one of my favorite things to do is travel around Florida.\n\nOne of my go-to spots is Fort Lauderdale, a refreshing city right on the Atlantic Ocean located about 30 miles north of Miami.\n\nWith a population of about 200,000 residents, this eastern Florida city is known for its quieter beaches, walkable downtown, and vibrant stores and restaurants.\n\nIt's also famous for having hundreds of miles of canals that curl in and around the city — a feature that's earned it the nickname \"Venice of America.\" Just like in Italy's Venice, these winding waterways are very much a part of daily life in this Florida city.\n\nHowever, if your mind is now swimming with images of Italy's lagoon-encased city filled with gondolas, keep reading before you book your trip to Fort Lauderdale.\n\nIf you plan on visiting Fort Lauderdale and want to indulge in the city's Venetian spirit, I've got suggestions for popular things you can do in the city.\n\nFor one, you'll want to head downtown and make Las Olas your home base. Las Olas Boulevard is a pedestrian-friendly roadway that runs parallel to the New River, which sits a few blocks south.\n\nIt stretches all the way to the beaches, but the part closer to the US-1 highway in the west is where you'll find the most popular stores and restaurants — many of which tout their water views to guests and offer lots of outdoor seating.\n\nHere, you can set out on foot to shop along the tree-lined boulevard, grab brunch at the French-inspired Café Bastille Fort Lauderdale, or visit the Historic Stranahan House Museum by the water.\n\nThough downtown Fort Lauderdale is definitely walkable — especially compared to other parts of South Florida — you don't have to set out on foot if you don't want to.\n\nLike the vaporetto in Venice, the area offers water taxis that you can pay to ride, but I suggest the LauderGO! Water Trolley, which is free.\n\nThe trolley transports visitors along the New River in Downtown Fort Lauderdale, allowing them to travel seamlessly from one popular spot to the next.\n\nIt runs from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., traveling in a loop and stopping at popular locations along the north and south sides of the river, including Riverfront Plaza, Esplanade Park, and Tarpon River.\n\nWhen I visited Venice, one of my favorite things to do was walk along the canals early in the morning or right before dusk. The gentle lapping of the water was calming, and the views were as beautiful as what I'd seen in pictures online.\n\nIn Fort Lauderdale, you can get that same feeling by wandering along the Riverwalk, a passageway that, as the name suggests, follows the curve and flow of the New River.\n\nI enjoy walking here in the morning with a coffee in hand, unhurried, as I take in the beautiful nature of South Florida.\n\nThe city is definitely worth a visit in its own right, but picturing an Italian-style city plopped down along Florida's southeastern coast will only set you up for disappointment — and you'll miss out on all the incredible things Fort Lauderdale has to offer.\n\nAlthough the vibes in these two cities are completely different, both have some beautiful canals that are integral to the local community.\n\nFort Lauderdale is no dupe for Italy, but it's a wonderful pick if you're looking to enjoy some waterside dining and sunshine.",

    "fullText": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of killing a traveling salesman during a robbery is set to become Florida's first execution of 2026 under a death warrant signed Friday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who signed off on a record 19 executions last year.\n\nRonald Palmer Heath, 64, is scheduled to die by lethal injection Feb. 10 at Florida State Prison. DeSantis oversaw more executions in a single year in 2025 than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The previous record was set in 2014 with eight executions.\n\nHeath was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery with a death weapon and multiple forgery charges in 1990.\n\nAccording to court records, Heath and his brother, Kenneth Heath, met traveling salesman Michael Sheridan at a Gainesville bar in May 1989. After hanging out at the bar for some time, the three men agreed to go somewhere else to smoke marijuana.\n\nAt some point, the brothers plotted to rob the other man, investigators said. Ronald Heath drove the group to a remote area, where Kenneth Heath pulled a handgun on Sheridan. The man initially refused to give the brothers anything, and Kenneth Heath shot Sheridan in the chest.\n\nAs Sheridan emptied his pockets, Ronald Heath began kicking the man and stabbing him with a hunting knife, prosecutors said. Kenneth Heath then shot Sheridan twice in the head.\n\nThe brothers dumped Sheridan's body in a wooded area and returned to the Gainesville bar to take items from his rental car. The brothers made multiple purchases with Sheridan's credit cards the next day at a Gainesville mall.\n\nRonald Heath was arrested several weeks later at his Douglas, Georgia, home after investigators connected him to the stolen credit cards. Officers recovered clothing purchased with the stolen cards, as well as Sheridan's watch, according to court records.\n\nKenneth Heath was also charged with Sheridan's murder, but he was sentenced to life in prison as part of a plea agreement.\n\nAttorneys for Ronald Heath are expected to file appeals to the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nA total of 47 people were executed in the U.S. in 2025. Florida led the way with a flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis. The state's final execution of 2025 was the Dec. 18 lethal injection of Frank Athen Walls, who was convicted of fatally shooting a man and his girlfriend during a home invasion robbery.",

The 10-day mission will have four astronauts on board who’ll be testing if Orion’s critical life support systems can sustain human passengers on future longer duration missions. They will first orbit the Earth twice before making their way 4,700 miles beyond the far side of the moon.

    "fullText": "The post Crocodile Crush: Why Florida’s Top Predator Isn’t Always the One You Think appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nBurmese pythons achieved the near-total disappearance of 3 native species in the Florida Everglades.\n\nSome species, such as foxes, marsh rabbits, and cottontail rabbits, have almost completely disappeared because of pythons in the area.\n\n2005 field data counterintuitively confirm that a Burmese python can consume an entire American alligator.\n\nPythons utilize nest-raiding to win the battle before crocodiles ever reach the showdown.\n\nWho do you think would win a fight between a python and a crocodile in Florida?\n\nGenerally, we would look to real-life examples for clues, but surprisingly, there isn’t very much of that. While there are a few examples of pythons getting into it with alligators in Florida, they don’t seem to have many significant interactions with crocodiles.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that we can’t wager a pretty good guess on our own, though. We can actually take a look at pythons and crocodiles in Florida and see who would emerge victorious in an encounter between them.\n\nThe Burmese python is not a native species in Florida. However, they are often found around the Everglades in South Florida. Native to Southeast Asia, Burmese pythons were first brought to the United States as exotic pets. Some pet owners ended up releasing the snakes into the wild, and the problem began.\n\nThe Burmese python is now considered to be a nuisance to the Everglades ecosystem, and for good reason. These pythons compete with native animals for food. They have also caused severe declines in many native species, including bobcats, opossums, and raccoons.\n\nSome species, such as foxes, marsh rabbits, and cottontail rabbits, have almost completely disappeared because of pythons.\n\nIn fact, they’ve even been known to eat alligators in some cases. In 2005, in the Florida Everglades, the body of a Burmese python was found with an American alligator in its stomach!\n\nThe American crocodile, or Crocodylus acutus, generally populate South Florida. This is the northern end of the crocodile’s range in most cases. They can be found in coves, ponds, and creeks in mangrove swamps, and they typically inhabit saltwater or brackish areas.\n\nFloridians will often see crocodiles basking in the sun. Because they’re ectothermic animals, they rely on external heat to regulate their body temperatures.\n\nThey are the largest reptiles on earth and are said to be able to produce tears. They can’t chew their food, and to improve digestion, they have been known to swallow rocks. Crocodiles also have special hearts. Their hearts have four chambers just like humans do!\n\nShy and reclusive, they’re generally not a danger to people. If they’re approached by a person while basking in the sun, they’ll usually just quickly escape into the water.\n\nAmerican crocodiles typically eat small mammals, frogs, fish, turtles, and birds. Humans are the main threats to crocodiles because of habitat destruction and illegal hunting.\n\nCrocodile nests are also in danger due to predators, such as birds, crabs, and raccoons. In some cases, pythons will even eat alligator and crocodile eggs.\n\nPythons live in tropical areas of Asia and Africa. They can thrive in either wet or dry environments; however, they are freshwater and fully marine. They like it where it is hot and wet so their bodies can stay warm. They are usually found in rainforests, woodlands, grasslands, swamps, and shrubs.\n\nThese types of environments are home to many different creatures, such as the crocodile. That’s why these creatures are natural enemies because they share the same waters and wetlands.\n\nIf a Ball Python are able to survive adulthood, they can live about 10 to 15 years in the wild. However, the expected lifespan for a ball python living in captivity is around 30 years. Some, however, have been recorded to live over 50 years old when cared for properly.\n\nWhen predicting who would win in a battle between a python and a crocodile, we need to consider all of the factors. Knowledge of the physical features of both of these animals is very helpful in this process.\n\nPythons are often longer than crocodiles, reaching up to 26 feet long, while crocodiles usually aren’t more than 20 feet long. However, crocodiles do have the size advantage, as they tend to be much heavier. While a python is typically no more than about 200 pounds, a crocodile can be up to 2,000 pounds.\n\nCrocodiles have the size advantage over pythons.\n\nBoth pythons and crocodiles have the ability to stay submerged under water for stretches of time. However, crocodiles are much faster, being able to run up to about 25 miles per hour in some cases. Pythons only slither at about one mile per hour. Even if crocodiles can only run for short distances, they can easily catch up to a python in most cases.\n\nCrocodiles have the speed advantage over pythons.\n\nPythons do have the ability to use heat sensors and chemical receptors to stalk their prey. However, they typically have poor eyesight. Crocodiles have better eyesight and are able to see in the dark. They have strong senses of hearing and smell, as well as the ability to sense even subtle changes in pressure.\n\nCrocodiles have keener senses than pythons.\n\nPythons and crocodiles are both relatively large animals, although crocodiles are significantly larger. Pythons can camouflage themselves fairly effectively. Pythons and crocodiles both have the ability to submerge themselves underwater.\n\nIn terms of physical defenses, it’s a tie between pythons and crocodiles.\n\nBoth pythons and crocodiles are known for surprise attacks. Pythons have sharp teeth and the ability to constrict their prey with their bodies. Their bite is painful, but they’re not venomous, and it is not a strong enough bite to be fatal in most cases. Crocodiles, on the other hand, have the strongest bite ever seen in a living animal.\n\nGiven the vital stats of both competitors in this fight, we’d have to say that in an encounter between a python and a crocodile in Florida, the crocodile would probably be the winner.\n\nOf course, pythons are not completely powerless. If they’re able to get past a crocodile mother and eat crocodile eggs, they can prevent crocodiles from even getting to the fight in the first place.\n\nPythons can clearly hold their own, which is why they are so successful as an invasive species in Florida. But given the size and strength of the crocodile, it would likely be no contest between the two. Perhaps at some point, we’ll see evidence of crocodiles helping to control this invasive species.\n\nThe simple answer here is yes. The python lives in an aquatic type habitat and while swimming it is vulnerable to attack. This means that if a python is in the water, it is within perfect striking conditions for crocodiles. While younger snakes can be captured and eaten more easily by a crocodile of any size. The older python the larger it gets, so depending on the age of the snake the crocodile may not attack.\n\nThe post Crocodile Crush: Why Florida’s Top Predator Isn’t Always the One You Think appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "fullText": "Florida State Seminoles transfer defensive back Edwin Joseph is committing to Ole Miss via the Transfer Portal, On3 has learned. He spent the previous three seasons with the Seminoles.\n\nEdwin Joseph is a native of Hollywood, Florida, where he played at Chaminade-Madonna Prep. He was a four-star recruit in the Class of 2023. Within that recruiting cycle, Joseph was the 345th-ranked player overall and the 11th-ranked athlete.\n\nWhile in high school, Joseph won back-to-back state championships. In 2022, he was also named a Nat Moore Trophy finalist.\n\nIn 2023, Joseph would play in four games, utilizing a redshirt that season. By 2024, he had played in all 12 games for the Florida State defense, and in 2025, he was a consistent starter at the safety position. For his career, he’d finish playing in 28 games for the Seminoles.\n\nDuring that time, he had 51 total tackles, 7.0 tackles for a loss, and 1.5 sacks. He would also snag four interceptions and defend nine passes. The vast majority of that production came during the 2025 season.\n\nEdwin Joseph and Mike Norvell did have a public back-and-forth during the season. That wasn’t the first time those two teams had publicly butted heads.\n\nIt was a difficult two seasons for Florida State on the whole. After winning the ACC in 2023, the Seminoles have failed to make a bowl game in the two subsequent years.\n\nThat included bottoming out to 2-10 in 2024 and going just 3-13 in ACC play during that time. Now, it appears as though the Seminoles will undergo some heavy turnover in the Transfer Portal, which Norvell will quickly need to address.\n\nNow, Joseph is going to be looking for an opportunity in Oxford. He’ll have two seasons of eligibility remaining once he gets there.\n\nMoreover, Joseph was rated as a four-star prospect in the On3 Transfer Portal Industry Rankings. He was the No. 75 overall recruit, and the No. 4 overall safety available after entering their name into the portal before committing to a new beginning. You can check out the full rankings HERE to see where each athlete slots in.\n\nThe 2025-26 college football transfer portal will last 15 days, spanning from Jan. 2 to Jan. 16, the NCAA decided. While players have just over two weeks  to enter the portal, they’re not under a deadline to commit when they enter. Traditionally, the cut-off for committing has been how late a school can enroll a player through admissions, so it varies throughout the sport.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\n— On3’s Dan Morrison contributed to this article.",

    "description": "One of Crystal Roure's last acts alive was to tell her 12-year-old son to get out of the house and call 911. Her family believes it saved his life.",
    "fullText": "As a single mom, Crystal Roure was fiercely protective of her children.\n\nSo when she started dating a handsome man from church, Crystal didn’t introduce him right away. In fact, she waited until they had dated for a full year before he met the kids.\n\n“She took her time,\" Crystal's sister, Stephanie Roure, told USA TODAY this week. \"She did have a happy glow that I haven't seen in a long time ... My sister trusted him and fell in love with him. She finally found her happy ever after.\"\n\nBut on Dec. 22, just two years after Crystal married Jason Kenney, he would end up killing her and shooting her 13-year-old daughter in the face in their Florida home − all over an argument about watching a football game three days before Christmas, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office. Kenney later fatally shot himself.\n\nThe crime during the December holidays shocked the nation.\n\n“The 13-year-old girl begged not to be shot – ‘Please don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me,’” Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a news conference the week of the attack. “And he shot her twice.”\n\nNow as Crystal's family reels from grief and shock, USA TODAY is telling her story and how she used her final moments alive to save her children.\n\nFrom an early age, Crystal Roure showed ambition and a commitment to hard work.\n\nHer sister Stephanie recalled how Crystal did well in school and thrived when she got her first job at T.G.I. Friday's as a teenager, quickly graduating from hostess to server.\n\n\"What set her apart from others was she didn't just work for a paycheck ... she worked for the experience,\" Stephanie said. \"She worked for the knowledge. She worked to prove to herself she was able to do things and not give up.\"\n\nBut when she became a mom at the age of 25, \"everything she did from that moment on was for her children.\"\n\n\"She worked harder and longer,\" Stephanie said. \"And somehow she was superwoman. She managed to hold down a full-time job and being a full-time mother.\"\n\nThough Crystal had to juggle work and the kids all while being single, she didn't miss a school function, award ceremony or field trip. She also managed to buy a house all on her own, \"because she was a smart woman,\" Stephanie said.\n\n\"Her children were her world. She worked hard for them, to provide for them. She protected them,\" she said. \"They came first before anything.\"\n\nEarly in the relationship, Facebook photos show the pair smiling and kissing each other in many selfies. Other show them and the kids looking like a picture-perfect family, posing in front of a Christmas tree and at a baseball game.\n\nBut sometime after they married on Nov. 4, 2023, Stephanie said: \"My sister lost that glow she had.\"\n\nAt first, Stephanie chalked up the change to the fact that Crystal became pregnant with her third child pretty quickly after the wedding.\n\n\"I remember asking her, 'Are you OK?'\" Stephanie said. \"She said, 'Yes,' it's just this pregnancy was really kicking her butt because she was much older.\"\n\nThough Stephanie said she always had an \"ehh\" feeling about Kenney, she thought her sister was happy and safe.\n\nThat is until she got the worst phone call of her life.\n\nCrystal and her three kids spent the evening of Dec. 22 by the Christmas tree at their home in Highland City, just east of Tampa. Meanwhile Kenney was in his shed, drinking and watching Monday Night Football until about 11 p.m., Sheriff Judd said.\n\nWhen Kenney went inside the home and wanted to continue watching the game, a fight ensued. It became so scary that Crystal told her 12-year-old son to run to a neighbor's house and call 911, Judd said.\n\nAs the boy ran out, he heard the first gunshot. Responding deputies found Crystal dead inside, her 13-year-old daughter shot in the face and shoulder, and Jason Kenney gone. They also found a letter Crystal wrote to her husband telling him: \"You're drinking, you’re using cocaine again. This is not the way the family should be. You need God.\"\n\nThe 1-year-old daughter the couple shared was unharmed. The 13-year-old survived the gunshot wound after the bullet hit the bridge of her nose and deflected through the top of her head, Judd said.\n\nAfter shooting his wife and step-daughter, Kenney drove in his truck to his late father's home and called his sister to say he had \"done something very, very bad\" and that it was the last time they would ever talk, Judd said.\n\nDeputies tracked Kenney down to a shed on his father's property. When they called for him to come out, they heard a single gunshot and found Kenney dead inside.\n\nJudd said that a relative told deputies that Kenney had been beating on Crystal \"for a while,\" though the sheriff's office has no records of any domestic violence calls or charges. Jason Kenney had no criminal history, Judd said.\n\n\"He absolutely destroyed a family,\" Judd said. \"When you go in there, there is a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of Christmas presents under the tree, just like the nuclear family should be ... and it ends up this way.\"\n\nCrystal's family is leaning on each other as they absorb the shock of her murder and raising funds for the children. Crystal's 13-year-old daughter \"is doing well on her recovery\" and \"it really is a miracle that the bullet missed every major thing,\" Stephanie said.\n\nAs for any abuse leading up to the tragedy, Stephanie said it's possible but she wasn't aware of any.\n\n\"After they were married I know she said he was drinking a lot more but she said that he was going to stop and said he would get help with it. Obviously that didn't happen,\" she said, adding that when she went over to visit, Kenney would \"sit outside in the shed playing games on his phone and smoking his cigarettes.\"\n\n\"If there was abuse happening he must have scared her to the point not to say or do anything because the type of person my sister was she would have left at the first sight of trouble because she would protect her kids,\" she said. \"But that's a question we'll never have answers to.\"\n\nStephanie said she's angry that Kenney killed her sister and tried to kill her niece but that she's so proud of Crystal and her nephew's actions that night.\n\n\"My sister died a hero for protecting her children and getting my nephew out of the house to make the 911 call,\" she said. \"She did that. She saved their lives and by doing so my nephew saved his sister's life, and thank God the baby was untouched.\"\n\nStephanie said she is going to do her best to teach her 1-year-old niece all about who her mom was.\n\n\"I will never let these kids forget the love and strength and courage she had for them,\" she said. \"They will always know that she loved them and put them first.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Florida mom of three killed by husband over NFL game 'died a hero'",

    "description": "One night at the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach wasn't enough time to take advantage of amenities like a five-star spa and a private beach.",
    "fullText": "As I'm stuck in my NYC apartment on a brisk day in January, I can't help but daydream about the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach in Florida. I spent one night there in October 2025 and booked the cheapest available room for $920.\n\nSitting in a cushioned rattan chair on my balcony as the sun went down, I could see the pool surrounded by palms and cabanas, tropical gardens, and the five-star hotel's private beach. It was the epitome of tropical luxury, and I couldn't believe I'd be leaving in the morning.\n\nThe oceanfront hotel in Palm Beach, Florida, is four stories tall with 207 rooms and suites — all of which have their own balcony.\n\nI've stayed at three Four Seasons hotels, and one thing I've learned is that each location is designed to suit the destination. So I wasn't surprised when I stepped inside the lobby and found a tropical decor style.\n\nWith details like chandeliers resembling ropes and pastel pillows patterned with fruit and leaves, it was impossible to forget I was in Florida.\n\nI booked a Palm View room, complete with a king-sized bed across from a TV, a small sitting area, and plenty of floor space. The interior design blended midcentury modern furnishings with pastel accents, making the room feel like a little beach house.\n\nIt was larger than most hotel room balconies I've seen, and there was a table and two cushioned chairs. As the sun began to set, I sat and took in the view of the gardens and the ocean. I long for more sunsets on this balcony.\n\nThe spa features a eucalyptus steam room, a saltwater whirlpool, and a range of treatments, including massages and facials. With less than 24 hours at this hotel, I didn't have time to use the spa.\n\nIf I had another night at the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach, I would have dined at Florie's.\n\nHerbs in the seasonal cocktails at Florie's Bar come straight from the hotel's garden. For those like me who don't drink, there are plenty of non-alcoholic cocktails available.\n\nThe restaurant serves dishes cooked over a live fire, from pizzas to steaks and fish entrées.\n\nI would also have loved to dine on the shaded patio at Seaway, a seafood restaurant with a wide selection of proteins, including lobster, stone crab, and local red snappers, as well as oysters, tiger shrimp, and fresh tuna.\n\nMany of the dishes feature tropical ingredients, such as coconut, pomegranate, and mango.\n\nI wish I'd had time to relax by the pool while being served frozen fruit and cooling towels.\n\nHow often do you find a pristine beach free of crowds on a hot day?\n\nJust past the pool at the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach, a sandy pathway leads to a private beach exclusive to Four Seasons guests. When I went, it was quiet and mostly empty. I wish I could have spent more time on this exclusive strip of the Florida coastline.\n\nTo truly relax into the luxury beach vibe of this five-star resort, I'll have to return for a longer stay to try the restaurants, experience poolside service, and spend more time on a quiet, peaceful beach.",

    "fullText": "A vigorous cold front is forecast to slide through Florida with confidence increasing that the pulse of winter chill will be felt all the way to the Keys.\n\nThe Canadian-cooled air is expected to reach the Panhandle on Sunday, Jan. 11 with wind chill temperatures possibly plummeting into the 20s during the early morning hours of Monday, Jan. 12 and daytime highs reaching only into the low 50s.\n\nIn the southern reaches of the state, low temperatures could dip into the upper 40s to mid-50s inland with the lower 60s felt along the water-warmed coasts. Daytime highs should hover around 70 degrees early in the week for much of South Florida.\n\nWhile meteorologists aren’t expecting the same slap of frigid temperatures that welcomed in the New Year — West Palm Beach got socked by a mercury reading of 39 degrees on Dec. 31 — it will be a change from more recent record-challenging heat:\n\nApalachicola sizzled at 77 degrees on Jan. 7, tying its record warm temperature set for that day in 1974.\n\nMiami reached 82 degrees, a full 6 degrees warmer than normal but below the 87-degree record set for that day in 2017.\n\nFort Pierce, on the Treasure Coast, was 84 degrees Jan. 7. That's 9 degrees above normal and near the record high of 86 set in 1990.\n\n“Everyone is talking about how warm it is and I’m thrilled with it. I love really warm weather,” said Lynn Murphy, who was working the front desk at the Driftwood Inn in the Panhandle city of Mexico Beach. “The high today (Jan. 8) is supposed to be 73 and I’m in long sleeves wishing I had a jacket.”\n\nMore: Dense fog blankets Florida: Advisories from the Panhandle to Miami\n\nThe cold front is attached to a zippy area of low pressure that will move northeast with a mix of rain and snow for areas from Michigan to Maine.\n\nRain chances increase for the western reaches of the Panhandle on Friday, Jan. 9, with up to an 80% chance of showers in Pensacola on Saturday, Jan. 10.\n\nAnd while North Florida could get whacked with temperatures in the upper 30s, the chill will moderate as it moves down the Peninsula.\n\n“Crystal River, Cedar Key, maybe Gainesville will be near the southern edge of the colder temperatures below 40 degrees,” said Brandon Buckingham, a meteorologist with AccuWeather. “It’s not a pure Arctic air mass but will be a return of a typical winter weather pattern.”\n\nA swirl of high pressure has dominated the southeast, pumping tropical air into more northerly latitudes, and allowing temperatures to rise. Weather gauges monitored by the Southeast Regional Climate Center have the average temperatures from Pensacola to Leesburg west of Daytona Beach at up to 9 degrees warmer than normal this month.\n\nEast coast cities from Miami to Vero Beach are still recovering from the New Year’s chill with temperatures between 1 and 2 degrees below normal since Jan. 1.\n\n“This won’t be like what we saw last time,\" said Miami-based National Weather Service meteorologist George Rizzuto trying to temper expectations. “We will see slightly reduced humidity and slightly reduced temperatures.

    "title": "Google billionaire Larry Page copies the Jeff Bezos playbook, buying a $173 million Miami compound that will save him millions in taxes",
    "description": "Critics warned a wealth tax in California would lead to a billionaire exodus. Florida says come on in, the water's warm.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page has quietly—or loudly—joined the billionaire exodus from California, shifting businesses east and dropping about $173 million on two ultra-luxury waterfront mansions in Miami’s Coconut Grove in a move that looks strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos’ relocation playbook. The timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look downright Bezos-ian.​\n\nIn late December and early January, The Wall Street Journal reported, Page snapped up two neighboring estates in Miami’s Coconut Grove, paying roughly $101.5 million for one waterfront compound and $71.9 million for another in an off‑market deal, for a combined outlay of about $173.4 million. One of the homes, previously listed for $135 million, spans 13 bedrooms and 15.5 bathrooms and sits directly on the water, while the second, bought from heiress Sloan Lindemann Barnett and her husband Roger Barnett, nearly doubled in value in less than five years.​\n\nThe purchases plant Page squarely inside one of Miami’s most exclusive enclaves, long favored by global elites seeking privacy, water access, and low‑key luxury. Local brokers say his splashy entry is part of a broader surge of high‑net‑worth Californians scouting Coconut Grove and other South Florida neighborhoods as they hedge against looming tax changes while upgrading to trophy waterfront properties. The real-estate purchases double as both a luxury retreat and a massive tax‑savings vehicle, with Page the most prominent of California’s ultrawealthy choosing to leave as state lawmakers are targeting fortunes like his with an aggressive wealth‑tax push.\n\nBehind the real-estate headlines, Page has been methodically severing his financial and legal ties to California ahead of a proposed wealth tax that targets residents worth more than $1 billion. Regulatory filings show he has moved his family office and several investment and holding entities out of the state, Business Insider reported, reincorporating key vehicles in Delaware and listing new business addresses in Florida.​\n\nThe New York Times previously reported Page had been telling associates he was considering Florida specifically because of a proposed ballot measure that would impose a 5% annual levy on the worldwide assets of billionaires domiciled in California. If passed and applied retroactively to residents as of Jan. 1, 2026, analysts estimate the tax could cost Page—currently ranked as the world’s second‑richest person—well over $10 billion.\n\n​​Some Silicon Valley executives, notably Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, warned such an outcome was possible, saying in late December founders would have to sell off parts of their companies to pay for “fraud, waste, and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.” California Rep. Ro Khanna responded to the Times‘ reporting that Page and Peter Thiel were looking to leave by flagging the story on X and saying, seemingly sarcastically in the style of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “I will miss them very much.”",

    "fullText": "It didn't take long for Florida quarterback DJ Lagway to find a new team. Less than a month after announcing his intent to transfer, Lagway reportedly committed to Baylor, according to Rivals.com.\n\nLagway's decision comes a day after he visited the school and was spotted attending a Baylor basketball game with Bears football coach Dave Aranda.\n\nBREAKING: Florida transfer QB DJ Lagway has committed to Baylor, @Hayesfawcett3 reports🐻https://t.co/WDcp436N9Y pic.twitter.com/GeiyboBmFg\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 8, 2026\n\nLagway, considered the top quarterback in the 2024 class, turned in a strong freshman season with the Gators. After starting the year on the bench, Lagway was pushed into the starting lineup following an injury to Graham Mertz.\n\nLagway threw for 456 yards and three scores in his first start, and then led Florida to a 6-1 record down the stretch, taking down multiple ranked opponents before beating Tulane in a bowl game.\n\nThat strong finish led to heightened expectations for both Lagway and Florida entering the 2025 season. Florida opened the year ranked No. 15 in the AP poll, and then rose to No. 13 after taking down LIU to kick off the season. But a loss to South Florida the following week dropped Florida out of the top-25.\n\nThat proved to be a harbinger of what was to come. Florida finished the year 4-8 and failed to jump back into the top-25 the rest of the way.\n\nLagway played a significant role in the team's demise. After being limited by shoulder issues last offseason, Lagway didn't play up to expectations as a sophomore, finishing the year with just 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 12 games.",

    "description": "The Seminoles have a new punter",
    "fullText": "The Florida State Seminoles are welcoming a new punter to Tallahassee. Daniel Hughes, who spent the 2025 season with the New Mexico Lobos, is transferring to FSU.\n\nHughes is 27 years old and is originally from Melbourne, Australia, and stands 6-foot-5, weighing 235 pounds. He has three years of eligibility remaining and owns a 4.0 GPA. He has a respectable social media following as well, and this article sheds some light on his uniqueness.\n\nHughes had quite a year in New Mexico after spending his prior season in JUCO. He put up numbers that weren’t school records only due to lack of total number of punts in New Mexico’s excellent offense. His net average of 43.6 yards per punt (on 37 total punts) would have been good for the second-best mark in Mountain West Conference history in addition to becoming a New Mexico school record.\n\nFrom the press release for his Honorable Mention All-Mountain West team selection:\n\nDaniel Hughes – Honorable Mention (P)\n\nA Ray Guy Award semifinalist, he is averaging 45.9 yards per punt with a net of 43.6 on just 37 punts with 12 inside the 20 and 13 punts of 50 yards or more. He has not shown up in the stats all season because of the lack of punts by UNM, but would be 16th nationally in punting.\n\nNew Mexico is seventh nationally in net punting, and the 43.6-yard average would easily be a school record, and it would be the second-best net punting mark in Mountain West history. He has averaged at least 46.0 yards per punt in seven of the 12 games this season (and it’s really seven of 11 as UNM didn’t punt against Nevada). Opponents are averaging 3.9 per return, and opponents have muffed three of his punts (8.1%).\n\nJunior College: Lettered in football for one season at City College of San Francisco … played in 10 games as a freshman, punting 49 times for a 37.3 yard average … had a long of 62 … pinned his opponents inside the 20 18 times on the season and forced 13 fair catches … had just two touchbacks.\n\nHigh School: Hughes did not play football at Mount Erin … he did play Footy in the Victorian Football League (VFL), playing for the Northern Bullants in 2021 and 2022, seeing action in 15 games.",

    "description": "About 15 years ago, I moved to a small town in Florida, three hours from where I grew up in Miami. Living this far from my hometown has been great.",
    "fullText": "Nearly 15 years ago, I moved to a small town on Florida's Space Coast, about three hours away from where I grew up in Miami.\n\nI hadn't planned to move out of the city forever, but I've since fallen in love with my quieter, slower pace of life. Fortunately, I'm not too far from where I grew up — and I've never stopped going back to Miami for visits a few times a year.\n\nI don't regret moving, and it turns out that living just a short drive from home comes with a lot of perks.\n\nAt first, returning to Miami after having just moved away felt so different.\n\nI'd been feeling pretty homesick, and I didn't immediately embrace small-town living in my new slice of Florida. However, once I was back home, I realized I felt most like myself in Miami — something I doubt I'd ever have noticed if I had never left.\n\nThat said, moving away ultimately helped me better understand myself and how my values have been shaped.\n\nFor instance, I forget how much everyday can feel like a party in Miami until I go back, and then I see that lively city is where I get the perspective that life should be celebrated.\n\nI've realized that even though I've left Miami, I can carry some of my favorite parts of the city with me wherever I go — and that's been really empowering.\n\nFor example, one of the things I miss most about Miami is its incredible Cuban food scene. I've yet to find anything as good where I live now, so I've learned how to make many of my favorite Cuban dishes at home.\n\nWith Cuban food being so accessible and affordable in Miami, I likely never would've learned how to cook any of it on my own if I still lived there.\n\nAnd, whenever I'm back in Miami, I still always stop at all of my favorite restaurants that just can't quite be replicated anywhere else.\n\nAll of my closest friends and some family members still live in Miami, so when I visit, I really get to spend a lot of time with whoever I'm staying with.\n\nWhile I'm often sad that we don't live close by and can't see each other all the time, I probably spend more quality time with them now than I did when I lived there.\n\nIn some ways, it's easier to see someone when it requires a bit of intentional planning, and you can't just pop by each other's homes anytime.\n\nSince I'm no longer a local, I get to see the city from a new perspective. I've loved experiencing the restaurants, nightlife, and beaches as visitors do — it's truly an energetic and unique place.\n\nI've noticed things that I didn't even realize I missed, such as driving around specific parts of Miami. I get to see how things are changing, but even places that have been there my whole life somehow seem more novel to me now.\n\nSince I've moved away, I've become more appreciative of certain things back home, particularly the food and my friendships.\n\nI feel really lucky to live just a short drive from the city I grew up in, which also happens to be a really fun place to visit. I'm aware that if home were a plane ride away, I definitely wouldn't be able to visit as often.\n\nWhen I'm there, I get to remember who I am and where I come from. However, I also get to see where I grew up in a new light, almost as if I were an outsider experiencing something for the first time.\n\nI was never really proud of being from Miami when I lived there, but now that I've sort of seen it as a tourist, I have a newfound pride for where I'm from.",

    "description": "Carson Beck's family isn't shy about showing their support for the Miami QB.",
    "fullText": "Carson Beck family tree: Meet sister Kylie, ex-NBA cheerleader mom and more about Florida roots originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDoes Carson Beck have a girlfriend?\n\nNot many college quarterbacks can say they had a resume the caliber of Carson Beck's.\n\nWhile both of his championships came as a backup when he played for the Georgia Bulldogs, Beck still cemented himself as a starter by 2023, when he threw for 3,941 yards and had 28 total touchdowns for Georgia. Then, Beck decided to play one last year in college, transferring to the Miami Hurricanes for a reported hefty NIL package.\n\nThose around Beck have been in the spotlight often, from his past relationship with Miami women's basketball star Hanna Cavinder, to his family, including his mom and sister.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of Beck's family tree.\n\nMORE: Why did Carson Beck transfer from Georgia to Miami?\n\nCarson Beck's sister is Kylie Beck. She is a former cheerleader and member of the dance team at Georgia, where she attended at the same time as her brother.\n\nWhen the quarterback departed Georgia for Miami, Kylie Beck, a sophomore at the time, also shared that she was leaving the Bulldogs behind. It hasn't been confirmed whether she also chose to attend Miami, but she's remained a close supporter of her brother with the Hurricanes.\n\n“Thank you letter to Athens. When one door closes, another door always opens with something greater on the other side,\" Beck wrote, per The Athlete Lifestyle on SI. \"I entered this new city hoping for greatness, success and happiness. Although there are times there was an abundance of these things, there were also times when I was at the lowest I’ve ever been and my family and I went through the hardest things we’ve ever dealt with. To say this experience has been a whirlwind of emotions would be an understatement.\n\nI am thankful that I’ve been able to call Athens my home for the past five years, traveling to games to support my brother and then making my dream a reality this past year when i was awarded the opportunity to be both a Georgette & Dance Dawg. It was such a blessing being by my brothers side and cheering him on from the field.\"\n\nLike Carson, Kylie is from Jacksonville, Florida, so the quarterback's transfer to Miami was closer to their home state.\n\nWhether as a Georgia cheerleader or just as a fan, Kylie has been a very vocal supporter of her brother's football career. She's shared plenty of social media posts about Carson.\n\nKylie Beck has also become known for her gameday outfits.\n\nKylie Beck is not a cheerleader for the Dallas Cowboys. However, she was invited to dance with the Cowboys cheerleaders in March 2025, posing on the field afterward.\n\nMORE: How does NIL money work in college football?\n\nCarson Beck's mom is Tracy Beck. She grew up in Clinton, Md., went to Maryland for college and danced for the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards) in the past, per The Athletic. Tracy Beck is a kindergarten teacher at Alimacani Elementary School in Jacksonville, Florida, where her kids were raised.\n\nLike the rest of Carson's family, Tracy has been a very public supporter of the quarterback's career.\n\nIn 2024, she told The Athletic that it's not \"who Carson is\" to remain in college as long as he had because of NIL.\n\n“There was no negotiating for money. That’s not who Kirby is. That’s not who this program is about, and that’s not who Carson is,” she said. “I think it’s cool he can do NIL this year and have an opportunity for all that. And those boys work so hard. I have never seen kids work as hard as they do. I mean it’s a full-time job to be a football player at the University of Georgia.\"\n\nHowever, Tracy also told The Athletic that she supports Carson's decision to buy a luxury car with his NIL money, as he's been focused on football first.\n\n“He’s so laid back and so focused on football and Georgia and his team. To him, that’s such a cool thing and be able to represent and do things for Georgia and for NIL,” she said. “But at the end of the day, talking about the car, it’s just a car. It’s very cool and amazing that he can drive something like that. But at the end of the day, it’s more about the team and coming back to try and do what they want to do this year.”\n\n\"Beck's Brigade\" is a gameday tailgate support group for Carson Beck that was started by his mother. Per Dawg Nation, Tracy Beck previously said watching Carson play always makes her nervous.\n\n“Honestly, he tells me to relax,” she said, per Dawg Nation. “I promise you that. He says ‘Don’t be nervous’ and ‘Be calm’ and ‘I’ve got this’ and ‘Tell everybody around you to not be nervous’ because it is nerve-wracking to be the quarterback’s mom and anybody’s mom.\n\n“Now some games have been close and I’ll cry at the end when we win and I’ll go out on the field.”\n\nMORE: Ranking the 19 greatest Miami players of all time\n\nCarson Beck's dad is Chris Beck. He is a former player at Navy, where he played linebacker from 1989-92, and he is now a retired Naval officer.\n\nWhen Carson Beck played for the Pablo Creek Saints, his dad was his coach, per the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nMORE:Carson Beck's tattoos, explained\n\nNo, Carson Beck's parents are no longer married.\n\nIt's unknown when Chris and Tracy Beck divorced, but according to EssentiallySports, the couple met in Annapolis, Maryland, before later moving to Florida and welcoming Carson in 2002, then Kylie.\n\nMORE:History of Miami QBs in the NFL, from Jim Kelly to Cam Ward\n\nAs of January 2026, Carson Beck hasn't been confirmed to be in a relationship with anyone.\n\nPreviously, he was in a high-profile relationship with Hanna Cavinder, a basketball player at Miami and popular social media influencer. Beck and Cavinder began dating in July 2024, per People, but rumors that they had split began in March 2025, not too long after Beck transferred to Miami and joined his girlfriend as a Hurricanes athlete.\n\nAt the time, per People, Cavinder had removed all signs of Beck from her Instagram profile, while her twin sister, Haley, posted on social media suggesting she had \"a gut feeling about a relationship\" and saw \"someone in my life that's hurting.\"\n\nBeck later confirmed his split with Cavinder to ESPN, saying, \"You make mistakes as a person, but it sucks that you have to go through something like that with someone that you care about, and now it's all over the Internet.\"\n\n\"Half of what you see in the media is true,\" Beck told ESPN. \"Half of what you see is not true. So, people pick their side of the story and run with it. The people that know the truth know the truth. But it's been difficult.\"\n\nMORE: When is the last time Miami won a championship in football?\n\nCarson Beck was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. He attended Mandarin High School; in 2018, he won the Florida \"Mr. Football\" award after throwing for 3,546 yards and 30 touchdowns as a junior.\n\nBeck led Mandarin to a state championship, and after initially committing to Florida as a baseball prospect, he switched to college football. Beck first committed to Alabama, then flipped his decision to Georgia and joined the Bulldogs in 2020.\n\nHas Carson Beck won a championship?",

    "description": "South Florida potentially finds its first QB of the Brian Hartline era. Van Buren arrives with 12 starts.",
    "fullText": "2026 represents a new chapter for South Florida football, as the Bulls flip from the Alex Golesh era to the Brian Hartline era.\n\nSouth Florida lost three-year starter Byrum Brown in the transfer portal, as the star dual-threat quarterback followed Golesh to Auburn. In return, the Bulls received a quarterback with substantial starting experience in the SEC.\n\nSouth Florida received a commitment on Wednesday, Jan. 7 from quarterback Michael Van Buren Jr., who suited up at Mississippi State in 2024 and LSU in 2025. Van Buren arrives with 12 games of starting experience, serving the majority of the 2024 campaign as the Bulldogs’ first-string QB and taking over as the Tigers’ starter during the last quarter and change of 2025.\n\nAs a true freshman in 2024, Van Buren threw for 1,886 yards, 11 touchdowns, and seven interceptions on a 54.7 completion rate. He collected 300 passing yards in two games that year, notably firing for 306 yards and three touchdowns in a 41-31 track meet defeat at Georgia.\n\nVan Buren transferred to LSU in December 2024, entering the year as the backup to Garrett Nussmeier. He ultimately took over as the Tigers’ primary quarterback on Nov. 8 against Alabama and retained the starting role for the final four games. He captained victories over Arkansas and WKU and nearly guided LSU to a major upset over a CFP-bound Oklahoma squad. Van Buren earned his last start in purple and gold in the Texas Bowl vs. Houston, where he exhibited some of his best work to date. He accumulated 267 passing yards, three touchdowns, and zero interceptions on a 16-of-26 showing, guiding LSU to 35 points in a narrow defeat — when LSU never surpassed 25 against an FBS opponent in the regular season.\n\nVan Buren’s mobility also improved as a true sophomore, racking up 129 yards on the season (105 in his four starts). The Bowie, MD native rattled off a 15+ yard carry in all four starts — a helpful trait if South Florida wants a similar style QB to Byrum Brown.\n\nSpeaking of Brown, Van Buren enters Tampa with massive shoes to fill. Brown is the only quarterback in USF history to surpass 3,000 passing yards in a season, and he did it twice. Brown just set the record for most passing touchdowns in a season by any Bull by 28, and he left the program ranked third all-time in rushing yards at 2,265.\n\nVan Buren takes over as a potential starter under Hartline and his new staff, as the former SEC quarterback takes on his third different school in a three-year span.",

    "description": "Growing up in Fort Lauderdale and moving to New York City has taught me that the cities we dream of won't always meet our expectations, and that's OK.",
    "fullText": "For nearly 20 years of my life, I lived in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe beaches, palm trees, and Pub Subs (sub sandwiches from Publix, for those unfamiliar) that were part of other people's vacations were staples of my everyday life.\n\nMaybe that's why I started yearning for somewhere that wasn't as calm and steady as I was used to — somewhere like New York City.\n\nI visited NYC for the first time in 2016, and four visits later, I made it my goal to live there one day.\n\nEach trip welcomed me with new experiences and places to explore. Getting to walk out of my hotel with no set itinerary and discover local coffee shops or pocket parks was a feeling I genuinely believed couldn't be replicated elsewhere.\n\nUnlike my days in Florida, which sometimes felt repetitive, New York always felt fresh.\n\nSo, in July, I made the leap and moved to the Big Apple. Like other transplants in their early 20s, I wanted to feel like I was living in a place that mattered, and the city's energy was intoxicating.\n\nDay by day, since moving to New York City, I've become more aware of the realities that come with actually living in the place I dreamed of.\n\nAs a tourist, I curated my experiences, planned my trips around perfect weather, and was able to appreciate a slowed-down version of the city.\n\nBut living in the city comes with a pace that's impossible to ignore.\n\nPublic transportation is crowded, fast-paced, and something I've learned to take into account when planning my days. I've had to learn to make decisions faster, leave earlier than necessary, and accept that even the smallest disruptions can throw off my entire day.\n\nPlus, the so-called \"New York tax\" that forces me to spend at least $30 the moment I walk out the door has been a humbling dose of reality.\n\nMoments like schlepping groceries in bad weather have made me miss how South Florida provides more space to slow down, too.\n\nI used to see New York City as a fantasy, but as a resident, I'm realizing that maybe that was the version I created for the \"me\" who was just passing through.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still see New York City's appeal — just not in the ways I used to. In the same way tourists flock to the beaches I grew up on, I now see NYC as a destination people project their biggest hopes onto.\n\nAfter months of living here, I've come to realize that the mundane aspects of everyday life are what make the city feel like home, from catching an express train just before it leaves the station to waving to my building's super.\n\nAnd now, I'm able to take these lessons home to Fort Lauderdale when I visit, which I've come to see in a whole new light.\n\nOn my first trip home, the beaches I used to visit every other month, and the constant hot weather I'd tried to avoid, carried a sense of charm I had really never appreciated growing up.\n\nExperiencing it from the perspective of someone who left made me feel grateful for all the little details I used to overlook.\n\nAfter that visit, I finally understood: A place can lose its appeal once it becomes familiar, but that doesn't mean it's no longer special. A dream city may never truly live up to the images we create of it, and that's OK.\n\nI'm learning to love New York's imperfections and am enjoying rediscovering the beauty of South Florida as well.\n\nBut moreover, I'm learning to accept that home doesn't have to be a place that constantly amazes me. It's where I choose to keep building, flaws and all — and for now, that place is New York City.",

    "description": "I never thought I'd find my forever home in the Midwest, but I fell in love with a small, affordable town in Wisconsin that I love more than Florida.",
    "fullText": "After growing up in North Carolina, I moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, at the age of 18 for college. That's where I fell in love with my now-fiancée — and the surrounding Pinellas County.\n\nWe both adored Florida's beaches, took regular weekend trips to Key West and Manasota Key, and thoroughly enjoyed life in the Tampa Bay area.\n\nAt times, I thought we might just stay there forever — but after graduation, the world felt wide open. So, we started \"shopping around\" the country for a new place to call home.\n\nMy partner and I packed up my truck and started our adventure by road-tripping across the Western United States.\n\nWe camped in the Badlands, swam in the Yellowstone River, slept in a canyon in Idaho, and in 2020, landed in Portland, Oregon.\n\nPortland was the epitome of cool — the kind of place where you could hike in the morning, grab a craft beer at night, and feel like you were living the hipster dream.\n\nHowever, after six months, I found myself struggling with poor air quality from local wildfires and missing the familiarity of St. Pete.\n\nSo, we moved back to Florida, hoping to relive our college days with close friends and potentially settle down.\n\nHowever, my fiancée and I struggled to put down roots.\n\nPinellas County and its housing market had undergone significant changes while we'd been away. Homes were selling for significantly more than they had been a few years ago, and many of those prices were far beyond our budget.\n\nThe rental market remained competitive as ever, too. We ended up renting a 400-square-foot ADU in the area for about $1,100 a month. At the time, it was the only place we found within our budget that had in-unit laundry and a decent location.\n\nWe made it work, and I even became friends with my landlord and his wife. However, heavy rain routinely flooded part of the unit, and after one particularly severe hurricane, the carpet was so soaked it had to be removed.\n\nBetween the worsening storms and rising house (and insurance) prices in the area, the idea of buying our first home here felt increasingly unrealistic.\n\nWe'd already been spooked by Hurricane Irma in 2017, and this felt like a small taste of the possible issues to come if we stayed.\n\nFortunately, by this point, I had a solid remote job, and we'd been building up our savings to put toward a down payment on a house.\n\nNow, we had to figure out where to go next.\n\nMy fiancée suggested we move to southern Wisconsin, near where her family lived. Real estate was cheaper there, and we could stay with her parents while house-hunting.\n\nI agreed, we moved, and we're still happily here years later.\n\nOur lives immediately felt different in a southern Wisconsin county with a population of about 100,000, in a town of less than 10,000.\n\nAfter living in one of the most densely populated counties in Florida, home to nearly 1 million people, I was thrilled to find a quieter place to call home.\n\nI've also fallen in love with the Wisconsin outdoors and all the adventures it has to offer. I've hiked Kettle Moraine State Forest, surfed on Lake Michigan, tested new fishing holes, and explored the lakes I'd only heard about before moving.\n\nThe locals seemed to welcome us instantly, and the community feels rich and full of life — new businesses always seem to be opening: a huge coffee shop, a speakeasy bar, and even a high-end restaurant.\n\nPlus, the local \"lake life\" offered the same laid-back vibe we used to enjoy finding around Florida's beaches.\n\nSoon, we bought a four-bedroom house in the area, securing a mortgage that costs us less than $1,500 a month.\n\nIn less than a year, we'd gone from living in someone else's tiny suite to having our very own four-bedroom home for a comparable monthly cost. We could hardly believe it.\n\nSure, winters can be a lot colder and tougher out in the Midwest, and we sometimes miss Florida, but I like the life we've built.\n\nI always say if the hipsters in Portland or the beach bums in Florida knew about small-town Wisconsin, they'd move here in a heartbeat (or at least visit in the summers).",

    "description": "Florida is adding depth to the defensive line. Baylor DL transfer DK Kalu committed to the Gators on Monday.",
    "fullText": "Former Baylor redshirt sophomore defensive tackle DK Kalu has committed to the Florida Gators.\n\nKalu announced his decision on Monday, Jan. 5, joining former teammate DJ Coleman in moving from Baylor to Florida. A consensus three-star prospect out of high school, Kalu redshirted in 2023 after not seeing any action as a true freshman. He played three games as a reserve defensive lineman in 2024, making one start and recording one solo tackle.\n\nIn 2025, Kalu played 281 total snaps, earning a 59.7 offensive grade, a 61.5 run-defense grade, a 68.4 tackling grade (49th among Big 12 defensive linemen) and a 54.0 pass-rushing grade from Pro Football Focus. He played in nine games, starting six, recording 11 total tackles (four solo) and 0.5 tackles for a loss.\n\n247Sports ranks Kalu No. 705 overall and No. 48 among defensive linemen in the 2026 transfer cycle. On3 has him at No. 684 and No. 75, respectively.\n\nHe was on campus this weekend for an official visit.\n\nCommitted 🐊 pic.twitter.com/WU9S8wrBkV\n\n— DK Kalu🇳🇬🤴🏿 (@dk_kalu) January 5, 2026\n\nFollowing transfer portal losses, including starter Michai Boireau, the Gators have five defensive linemen in 2026. Redshirt senior Jamari Lyons has starting potential, as does redshirt junior Brendan Bett. Kalu is a depth addition, but he will compete for a starting job. Florida also returns Joseph Mbatchou and Jeramiah McCloud, and freshman Kendall Guervil recently signed as well.\n\nThe dilemma is that Boireau primarily played nose tackle for Florida last year, which none of the names mentioned above have much experience at. Lyons could step into that role, opening the door for Bett and Kalu to rotate alongside him. Florida could also add another defensive lineman from the transfer portal.\n\nAt 6-foot-4-inches, 309 pounds, Kalu provides size and depth to the position room.\n\nKalu is the fourth official transfer portal addition of the 2026 cycle for Florida, following Baylor safety DJ Coleman, James Madison tight end Lacota Dippre and Georgia Tech wide receiver Bailey Stockton.\n\nFlorida is also expected to land Georgia Tech quarterback Aaron Philo and interior offensive lineman Harrison Moore.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida Gators football earns commitment from Baylor DT DK Kalu",

    "description": "After moving from West Virginia to Miami in South Florida a few years ago, I've fallen in love with the great weather and budget travel deals.",
    "fullText": "Throughout my childhood, my family barely strayed from the parts of West Virginia's Appalachia region where I was born and raised.\n\nI spent college two hours away in Ohio, and during those years, I started traveling around the United States and to more distant places in Europe and Latin America.\n\nI love exploring the world, so when it was time to graduate and start a life somewhere new, I applied to jobs all around the country.\n\nI took the first one I could get, and it happened to be in Miami. I'd never been to Florida before, but I quickly found things in Dade County I enjoyed.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of living here, there are three big things I love about living in Miami — and one thing I still miss about West Virginia.\n\nA lot of people have opinions about this one, but as someone who grew up in a colder climate, I much prefer Miami weather.\n\nSummer aside, most weeks are sunny and fairly comfortable with a lot of days between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are pleasantly short, sunny, and warm.\n\nI also struggle with depression, which can be impacted by the seasons, so having the ability to go outside and get some sunshine any time of the year is a major bonus for me.\n\nThough summertime in Miami can be uncomfortably hot and humid and hurricane season is no joke, I still prefer the weather here to any place that experiences a harsher winter.\n\nAs a travel writer, I'm constantly booking trips and visiting new cities and countries. And when I'm not hopping on a plane or road tripping to a different part of Florida, I can still experience a variety of communities and cultures in Miami.\n\nMost people know Miami for its Cuban influence, but the city is also home to a huge variety of expats from other parts of Latin America, like Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina.\n\nThere's also a lot of diversity from other parts of the world, too. For example, Miami Beach has one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel, and there's also a huge variety of Bahamian, Jamaican and other Caribbean cultures here.\n\nMiami is constantly growing and changing, and I love that I can learn about so many different cultures without traveling too far.\n\nOne of my favorite perks of living in Miami truly is how easy and convenient it is to travel from the city.\n\nFor starters, there are two major airports nearby — Miami International Airport (MIA) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL).\n\nMiami is also the cruise capital of the world, and there are constantly ships sailing from the ports in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nI'm a budget traveler at heart, and I've scored some incredible travel deals from South Florida. I regularly find flights to Europe for less than $400 from these airports, and I can fly to many places around the US for less than $150.\n\nSince I moved to Florida, I've developed a deep appreciation for the beach. However, I still definitely miss the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nThey're the oldest mountain range in the United States, and these rolling hills are the perfect place for exploring. My favorite time to visit West Virginia is in the late spring or early summer when the trees are at their fullest and brightest.\n\nPalm trees are beautiful, but I definitely miss how serene and peaceful nature can be in West Virginia — especially when compared to how busy and chaotic Miami can feel sometimes.",

He visited UF over the weekend along with teammate and wide receiver Bailey Stockwell.\n\nA redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining, the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo showed promise as a backup quarterback in two seasons with the Yellow Jackets, throwing for 938 yards with 2 TDs to 3 interceptions over two seasons while rushing for 95 yards and 1 TD. Philo has appeared in seven games over two seasons and while alternating with starter Haynes King, helped lead Georgia Tech to a 28-23 upset win over Miami on Nov. 9, 2024.\n\nA three-star recruit out of Prince Andrew Christian School in Bogart, Ga., Philo broke Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence's high school record for passing yards in the state of Georgia with 13,922 yards during his prep career.\n\nPhilo will compete with redshirt freshman Tramel Jones Jr. for the starting quarterback job at Florida. Jones, who announced his intention to return to UF in December, completed 21 of 35 passes for 191 yards and 2 TDs in two games as former UF quarterback DJ Lagway's backup last season. Florida also brings back redshirt sophomore quarterback Aidan Warner and adds incoming four-star freshman quarterback Will Griffin, who plans to enroll at UF this month for the spring semester.\n\nPhilo joins Baylor safety DJ Coleman as the second commitment in UF's 2026 transfer portal class.\n\nKevin Brockway is The Gainesville Sun’s Florida beat writer.

    "description": "Cynthia Diekema, 61, was killed by an alligator while on a canoe ride with her husband in Florida last year",
    "fullText": "Cynthia Diekema, 61, was canoeing with her husband last year when they crashed into an alligator in their canoe and both fell into the water, according to a report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission recently obtained by PEOPLE\n\nThroughout the attack, he said that his wife seemed alert, but unable to speak and had a \"puzzled look on her face\"\n\nHer cause of death was listed as “multiple blunt force injuries from an alligator,\" according to the report.\n\nNew details have emerged about an alligator attack that claimed the life of a 61-year-old woman as her husband fought to save her life.\n\nOn May 6, around 4:02 p.m. local time, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission responded to an alligator encounter near the mouth of Tiger Creek in Polk County.\n\nThe woman, later identified as Cynthia Diekema, was canoeing with her husband when they encountered the reptile and both fell into the water, the FWC later shared.\n\nThe 11-foot, 4-inch alligator then bit Cynthia and pulled her into the water before she was \"later found deceased.\"\n\nNearly eight months after the attack, an incident summary report from the FWC, which was obtained by PEOPLE via a public records request, revealed additional information about what happened on that horrifying day.\n\nIn a sworn statement to authorities, David Diekema, Cynthia’s husband, said that he and his wife were traveling on an 11-foot plastic canoe that departed earlier that day from Lake Kissimmee State Park.\n\nOnce they entered the shallow waters of Tiger Creek, David says that they observed numerous alligators — and right before the attack, his wife commented on how they were \"about to go right over top of one,\" according to the report.\n\nAs the canoe crashed into the animal, which was resting on the bottom of the creek, the startled animal began to thrash, according to the report, which caused the canoe to capsize and sent the couple into the water.\n\nWhen he was able to stand up, David said he saw Cynthia’s torso in the alligator’s mouth.\n\nAccording to officials, he said he \"attempted to free her from the alligator's mouth for several minutes,\" but was unsuccessful.\n\nThroughout the ordeal, he said that his wife seemed alert, but unable to speak and had a \"puzzled look on her face.\"\n\nAt one point, the alligator whipped its tail, knocking David off of his feet, according to the report. During that time, he also said the alligator \"momentarily released\" his wife before biting her again on the shoulder.\n\nAfter regaining his balance, he tried once again to free his wife from the alligator's mouth, however the alligator then \"conducted a death roll and immediately swam away with Mrs. Diekema in its mouth.\"\n\nKnowing that time was of the essence, David — who lost his phone during the ordeal — bailed as much water as he could from the canoe and paddled north of Tiger Creek until he reached Lake Kissimmee, per the report. There he was rescued by a good Samaritan in an airboat.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into their search, the FWC recovered Cynthia's body and EMS pronounced her dead at the scene. The alligator was captured and euthanized around 7:30 p.m. local time that same day.\n\nA coroner later performed an autopsy and shared their findings with the FWC, detailing numerous injuries, including the amputation of her right arm below the shoulder.\n\nThey stated that the preliminary cause of Cynthia’s death was “multiple blunt force injuries from an alligator” and the manner of death was ruled as an “accident,\" according to the report.\n\nThe day after the incident, investigators returned to the scene to find any other alligators that were involved in the attack and to capture those that are potentially dangerous in the Tiger Creek area. One alligator was dispatched by an officer and moved onto an airboat bound for Kissimmee Park. No other gators were located.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“The FWC extends its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the victim during this difficult time,” the department said in a previous statement.\n\nCynthia was from Paw Paw, Mich., and is survived by her husband David, two children and two grandchildren, per her obituary.\n\n\"She radiated her inner and outer beauty in all she did and had unconditional love for everyone,\" the obituary read. \"She cherished her family and every moment and adventure they spent together.\"",

    "description": "Donald Trump reportedly ordered his motorcade to stop at a Florida strip mall Friday morning so he could purchase supplies for his White House ballroom.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reportedly ordered his motorcade to stop at a Florida strip mall Friday morning so he could purchase supplies for his $400 million White House ballroom.\n\nWhite House pool reports said the presidential motorcade “arrived at a shopping center in Lake Worth, Florida at 9:46 AM” so Trump could go “shopping at Arc Stone & Tile,” an importer of Italian marble.\n\nWhen pressed, a White House official said that the president “is purchasing lake and onyx, at his own expense, for the White House ballroom.”\n\nAlthough he may pay for the materials himself, conservative publication The New Republic pointed out that the president was shopping for his construction project “on the taxpayer’s dime.”\n\n“Trump has brought his longtime obsession with marble to his second term, pushing for it to appear just about everywhere,” TNR reported, noting that Trump “redid the bathroom in the White House Lincoln Suite entirely in marble, and he has proposed marble armrests for the Kennedy Center, claiming it would be ‘unlike anything ever done or seen before!'”\n\nTrump proudly shared photos of the Lincoln bathroom’s marble makeover replete with gold fixtures, writing on Truth Social in October that the “art deco green tile style” used in the 1940s “was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era.”\n\n“I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble,” Trump continued. “This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n\nTrump’s ballroom construction program came under fire immediately after he began tearing down the entire East Wing of the White House. The president initially said the ballroom would cost around $200 million, before revising it to $400 million. Trump has said the ballroom is completely privately funded.\n\nTrump has been staying at his private Florida club at Mar-a-Lago for New Year’s Eve celebrations. He also met there with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe post Trump’s Motorcade Reportedly Stops At a ‘Random’ FL Strip Mall So He Could Buy Marble For His Ballroom Project first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Florida is targeting the top cornerback in the transfer portal, Jontez Williams, and will host him on a visit next week.",
    "fullText": "Cornerback Jontez Williams, the top player at his position in the 2026 transfer cycle, will visit with the Florida Gators on Thursday, Jan. 8, according to On3's Hayes Fawcett.\n\nBoth Gators Online and Swamp247 have confirmed the report. The former Iowa State Cyclone is also set to visit Notre Dame (Jan. 5-6) and USC (Jan. 3). Penn State remains a possibility as well, should Williams desire to follow his former head coach, Matt Campbell, to Happy Valley.\n\nA Florida native, Williams grew up playing high school ball 40 minutes away from the University of Florida at Bradford High in Starke.\n\n247Sports ranks him No. 34 overall and No. 1 among cornerbacks in the 2026 transfer portal cycle, while On3 has him at No. 14 and No. 1, respectively.\n\nA three-star recruit out of high school, according to 247sports and Rivals, Williams spent his first two seasons at Iowa State developing into an all-conference defensive back. He redshirted in 2022 after seeing no action and played in 13 games (two starts) in 2023. He finished his redshirt freshman year with six tackles (two solo) and three pass breakups.\n\nThe 2024 campaign saw Williams break out, starting 12 of 14 games for the Cyclones. He finished sixth on the team with 46 tackles (nine solo) and was tied for third in the Big 12 with four interceptions. He also recorded nine pass deflections and two tackles for a loss. He was named to the All-Big 12 Second Team by the coaches that year.\n\nWilliams' 2025 season was cut short after five games due to a torn ACL in his right knee. He ended the year with 15 tackles and one interception.\n\nThe Orange and Blue are losing Devin Moore to graduation and both Jamroc Grimsley and Teddy Foster to the transfer portal, leaving seven cornerbacks on the roster.\n\nRising juniors Dijon Johnson and Cormani McClain are the most veteran returners and are expected to start, followed by rising sophomore J'Vari Flowers and rising redshirt freshmen Ben Hanks III and Onis Konanbanny. Florida added a pair of four-star recruits, CJ Bronaugh and CJ Hester, during the early signing period.\n\nWilliams would likely step in as the top player in the position room, should he choose Florida.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida football hosting transfer CB Jontez Williams on visit",
