    "fullText": "The search for the 57-year-old Fort Myers attorney and his 33-year-old nephew continues Sunday after the pair was reported missing Dec. 19 after a fishing trip off the coast of Naples.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard is leading the search along with partner agencies to find attorney Randall Spivey and his nephew Brandon Billmaier, who were reported missing at about 9 p.m. Friday. The boat they'd been using for their trip had been scheduled to return at about sunset.\n\nThe pair went out in a 42-foot Freeman boat named \"Unstopp-A-Bull,\" according to Luis Garcia, the supervisor on watch for the Coast Guard sector in St. Petersburg. The Coast Guard found the boat floating upright in the Gulf about 70 miles off the coast of Naples, with no signs of the missing boaters.\n\nNow, one of the largest searches in Southwest Florida history is underway, with a large community effort behind it.\n\nHere's what we know so far, as of noon, Sunday, Dec. 21.\n\nAs of 10 a.m. Sunday, Dec. 21, Randall Spivey and Brandon Billmaier, the Florida boaters reported missing Dec. 19 after a fishing trip off the coast of Naples, had not been found, according to Billmaier's wife, Deborah.\n\n\"Updates after speaking with the U.S. Coast Guard this morning,\" Deborah Billmaier wrote in a Facebook post Sunday. \"The EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon) was unfortunately still on the boat. They were bottom fishing when the incident occurred (still not sure exactly what occurred.)\"\n\nThe post also mentioned that a couple of life jackets were not found on the boat, indicating that Spivey and Billmaier may be wearing them.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg posted news of the search on social media Saturday morning, Dec. 20.\n\nAccording to the Facebook post, air and surface crews from the agency and partner agencies U.S. Coast Guard Station Fort Myers Beach, U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Miami and Lee County Sheriff's Office are involved in the search.\n\n\"The search effort support features an 87-foot boat on water, 45-foot boat, 60-foot helicopter, 144 plane, 6130 Air Force from Patrick Air Force Base and an 144 continuing through the day (not sure if this is a boat or a plane),\" Deborah Billmaier wrote in her post the following morning.\n\nAn urgent marine broadcast has also been issued to all vessels in the area to help expand the search range, said Billmaier.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard coordinated one of the largest search parties in Southwest Florida history Sunday morning, Dec. 21, starting at first light, according to Deborah Billmaier, wife of Brandon, Billmaier. In her Facebook post, she asked those with capable vessels to help out.\n\nFlorida Rep. Peggy Gossett-Seidman shared the post on X.\n\nErin Shaw Harrel of Facebook group SWFL Boaters urged people Saturday to take to the water to search for the missing boaters, providing these coordinates for the search: 25-51.67N 083-12.16W.\n\nBrent Stokes, owner of Stokes Marine, also asked for volunteers to help search.\n\nAccording to Stokes, anyone willing to help with the search could call Tricia Spivey at 239-896-4099 or the U.S. Coast Guard at 727-322-4180.\n\nAttorney Randall Spivey, 57, and his 33-year-old nephew Brandon Billmaier were reported missing at about 9 p.m. Friday, Dec. 19.\n\nTricia Spivey reported her husband and nephew missing Friday night, said Luis Garcia, supervisor on watch for the Coast Guard sector in St. Petersburg. “They were going to fish about 102 miles offshore.”\n\nSpivey is a white male, 6’1”, 245lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing khaki pants and a dark in color shirt, according to Lee County Sheriff's Office. Billmaier is a white male, 6’2”, 250lbs, with strawberry hair and brown eyes.\n\nThe pair went out in a 42-foot Freeman boat named \"Unstopp-A-Bull,\" Garcia said. The Coast Guard later found the boat floating upright in the Gulf about 70 miles off the coast of Naples, but no signs of the missing boaters.\n\nTricia Spivey says GPS coordinates from the boat's spot tracker led them to that location near Marco Island and Flamingo. That's where the search has been concentrated.\n\nThe Lee County Sheriff's Office requested the public's help in locating Spivey and Billmaier.\n\nIf anyone knows about the pair's whereabouts, they can call 911, if applicable, or call the sheriff's office at 477-1000. To remain anonymous, you can also call SWFL Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-TIPS.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Myers News-Press: Missing boaters updates Sunday as search continues in Florida",

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",

    "fullText": "Donovan Metayer was a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida when a gunman opened fire and killed 17 people on Valentine’s Day 2018.\n\nA young man who was a “radiant” child according to family and friends, has died.\n\nDonovan Joshua Leigh Metayer, 26, died on Dec. 15 by suicide. Metayer, who survived the 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, suffered from mental health episodes following the tragic incident and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The shooting occurred during Metayer’s senior year, when most students are thinking about college applications and their life after high school.\n\nBut the shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 people, had a profound effect on Metayer and stands as an example of how the trauma of gun violence can linger on for years.\n\nThe youngest child of the Metayer family, Donovan was brilliant from an early age and excelled academically. His humor, according to a GoFundMe page dedicated in his honor, could “light up any room.”\n\nIn the years following the Parkland shooting, Metayer’s dreams of attending college and working in his preferred career field of computer science began to fade. On multiple occasions, he would be hospitalized for suicidal ideation and after one mental health episode in 2021, he was Baker-acted and deemed temporarily unable to purchase a firearm.\n\nYears later, with the help of a private psychiatrist and the Henderson Clinic Metayer began making progress and healing. He’d soon work at Office Depot and earn a promotion and an IT certificate. His mental health journey echoes that of many Black boys across America, masking emotions and not wanting to be seen as a “burden” by family. Treatment, from therapy to medication, may seem like a difficult path thanks to limited resources, social stigmas and more.\n\nHowever, just as Metayer was progressing and gaining more independence according to his family, he soon learned his Risk Protective Order had lapsed.\n\nMetayer then purchased a gun from a gun shop in the area and within a week, he turned the gun on himself.\n\nIn a statement shared on his GoFundMe page, Donovan’s family wrote, ” Donny’s passing is a heartbreaking reminder of the mental health crisis plaguing our youth and the lasting trauma of gun violence on our community. As we grieve his loss, we are breaking the code of silence in his memory. Though Donny’s life was brief, his impact will be everlasting.”\n\nThe family is asking for funds to assist for Metayer’s celebration of life and endow a fund at the Henerson Clinic that will “provide healthcare, housing and hope for people of all ages with behavioral health conditions” throughout the state of Florida.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health challenges, emotional distress, substance use problems, or just needs to talk, call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org 24/7.\n\n‘They beat our brother’: New York community demands justice after video shows police beating a Black man\n\nRay J has restraining order extended following November arrest, faces 6 misdemeanor charges: ‘I’m missing my kids’\n\nDeaths of Missisippi mom Shardee McGill and 3-year-old daughter determined to be murder-suicide",

    "description": "Old Dominion collects signature win to finish best season ever, while holding the nation’s #2 offense to 10 points.",
    "fullText": "The Old Dominion Monarchs fully joined the FBS in 2014 and rapidly acclimated to the highest level of college football, producing a 10-3 record in 2016. However, through the 2024 season, that was the only winning season Old Dominion ever produced. That changed in 2025, and the program reached a new pinnacle on Wednesday night in Orlando.\n\nSixth-year head coach Ricky Rahne rattled off nine regular season wins to seal Old Dominion’s second winning record as an FBS program, and this breakout 2025 aptly concluded with a statement 24-10 upset over South Florida in the StaffDNA Cure Bowl. In the process, the Monarchs earned their biggest win in program history, adding a second bowl trophy to the shelf while tying their FBS record for wins in a season.\n\nSouth Florida entered this matchup ranked second in the FBS in points (43.0) and yards (502) per game, lighting up opponents with seven games of 48+ points. Only twice did the Bulls score fewer than 31 all season — an 18-16 win over Florida and a 49-12 defeat to playoff-bound Miami (FL). USF faced obvious obstacles with the losses of head coach Alex Golesh (to Auburn), quarterback Byrum Brown, and Keshaun Singleton, and the Bulls could not overcome those absences nor the Old Dominion defense.\n\nSouth Florida registered just 10 points, scoring one first half touchdown and facing a second half shutout to a relentless Monarch bunch. Old Dominion made its presence felt with four sacks and five takeaways, concocting a +4 in the turnover battle against one of the nation’s best turnover-producing teams. Outside linebacker Jeremy Mack totaled a game-high 11 tackles and a sack, while free safety Jerome Carter snagged two interceptions in a 3.5-hour defensive clinic by the boys from Norfolk.\n\nOld Dominion’s offense also faced some pregame adversity, as Sun Belt Offensive Player of the Year Colton Joseph opted out of the remainder of the 2025 season, thrusting Quinn Henicle into the starting quarterback spot. Henicle started and won a game in 2024 with 204 rushing yards, and the sophomore’s mobility was on full display in ODU’s massive win. He only completed 11-of-25 passes but made his presence felt on broken plays, scrambling up the middle for massive gains. Even after four sacks he rattled off 107 rushing yards and two touchdowns, delivering a 51-yard blow with 2:32 remaining to put the game out of reach. Henicle, who returned from a brief third quarter injury stemming from a targeting call, won MVP honors for his effort in Orlando.\n\nSouth Florida’s backup quarterbacks did not enjoy the same level of production as Henicle. Sixth-year senior Gaston Moore earned his first and last collegiate start at quarterback to replace Byrum Brown, and Moore finished 20-of-28 with 236 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions. He had one first half sequence where he connected with true freshman Jeremiah Koger for back-to-back 25 and 31-yard pickups — with the latter serving as USF’s lone touchdown. But there wasn’t much explosiveness in the passing game otherwise.\n\nMoore’s last throw was a notable one, and unfortunately for the longtime backup, it was his final collegiate pass. In the fourth quarter, trailing 17-10, he sent a 20-yard strike to JeyQuan Smith at the Old Dominion 14-yard line, and Smith made a spectacular diving grab. However, Moore took a brutal hit while releasing the ball that caused his head to collide with the Camping World Stadium field, ultimately knocking him out of the final 12 minutes.\n\nProtesting the hit, South Florida guard Cole Skinner and interim head coach Kevin Patrick were both assessed with 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalties. Then USF took a sack and holding on the next two plays, ultimately moving the Bulls back from the Old Dominion 14 to their own 38 — a monumental 48-yard difference. USF never even crossed the ODU 40-yard line again, as those penalties proved instrumental in the defeat.\n\nTrue freshman Locklan Hewlett, whose passing experience was limited to a 45-yard fake punt touchdown in Week 1, finished the effort for the Bulls. But on a 4th and 6 from its own 47-yard line with 3:45 remaining, South Florida made the questionable decision to run a fake punt — this time, without Hewlett disguising as a punter. Punter Chase Leon was intercepted by Jerome Carter on a play that never stood a chance, ultimately putting a dagger in USF’s hopes at a 10-win season.\n\nSpecial teams also played a significant role in this contest. Both teams missed two field goals in this game, including several attempts under 40 yards. But special teams ended up favoring Old Dominion overall as the Monarchs denied South Florida of a critical fourth quarter possession. An ODU punt hit a USF gunner two times on Wednesday evening, and on the second occurrence, Monarch long snapper Brendan Durkin made a mid-air recovery after the ball bounced off the gunner and return man.\n\nSouth Florida (9-4, 6-2 American) missed out on a golden opportunity for its first 10-win season since 2017. The Bulls enjoyed their best season in nearly a decade but it comes to a bitter end, as they will be denied a season-ending ranking — a feat the team hasn’t accomplished in eight years. The Bulls now officially move into the Brian Hartline era, as the Ohio State offensive coordinator relocates to Tampa when the Buckeyes’ playoff run is complete.\n\nOld Dominion (10-3, 6-2 Sun Belt) sealed its best season as an FBS member with a victory for the ages. Two of the three Monarch losses — Indiana and James Madison — are competing in the College Football Playoff, and they now unlock a new signature win by upending South Florida. Ricky Rahne celebrated his first bowl win as head coach, capping off an unforgettable moment in the program’s young history.",

    "fullText": "Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino is reportedly already clearing out his office ahead of an imminent departure from the Bureau and a potential return to the MAGA media circuit, the New York Times has reported.\n\nBongino has told associates he could leave “as soon as this week or as late as mid-January,” people familiar with his plans told The Times on Wednesday. He has not yet made a formal announcement.\n\nTo back the claims, however, the newspaper’s sources further revealed that Bongino has begun shipping office “knick-knacks” and other personal belongings back to Florida, where he plans to resume his broadcasting career in time for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nSources told Fox News Digital on Monday that Bongino had not made a final decision and denied his office was empty, but did add that he was expected to declare his intentions in the coming weeks.\n\nThe former podcaster arrived at the FBI this year promising disruption and ideological clarity, after President Donald Trump nominated him.\n\nHowever, the Times reported that earlier this month, Bongino floated the idea of choreographing his exit around a major law enforcement moment to associates. He allegedly said he may announce his resignation at a press conference tied to the investigation into who planted pipe bombs near Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the January 6 riots in 2021.\n\nThe newspaper added that behind-the-scenes, Bongino has also made a point of repairing relations with Attorney General Pam Bondi, whom he had accused of mishandling the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein in July.\n\nAt that time, he reportedly threatened to resign after Bondi’s department released a memo concluding that the much-hyped “Epstein client list” did not, in fact, exist – a topic that had been a focus of Bongino’s podcast before his tenure.\n\nThe post Dan Bongino Clearing Out His Office in Preparation for FBI Exit: NY Times first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The Old Dominion Monarchs (9-3) travel to Camping World Stadium for their StaffDNA Cure Bowl against the South Florida Bulls (9-3)\n\nWith both star quarterbacks opting out, my Old Dominion vs. South Florida predictions anticipate a low-scoring affair.\n\nRead on for my college football picks for Wednesday, December 17.\n\nI’m leaning toward Old Dominion to pull off the upset. The Monarchs are only missing their quarterback, but their coaching staff and defense remain intact.\n\nSouth Florida enters with far more disruption, including a new interim head coach and a reshuffled offense, making Old Dominion the more stable and reliable side.\n\nWednesday’s Cure Bowl matchup between the Old Dominion Monarchs and South Florida Bulls sets up as a lower-scoring, grind-it-out game.\n\nBoth teams enter with major question marks at quarterback, and inexperience at the position often leads to conservative play-calling, fewer explosive plays, and an emphasis on protecting the football.\n\nOld Dominion will turn to freshman Quinn Henicle, while South Florida starts journeyman Gaston Moore, an inexperienced combination that points toward the Under.\n\nDefensively, both units have proven capable of limiting points; Old Dominion allowed just 19.5 points per game during the regular season, while South Florida surrendered 23.\n\nThose are solid defensive numbers that reflect good red-zone defense and an ability to turn long, time-consuming drives into field goals.\n\nNeither defense was prone to getting gashed for quick scores during the regular season, and I don’t expect that to change with backup quarterbacks under center.\n\nThe continuity of Old Dominion’s stop unit, combined with a stout USF defense and likely ground-first approach from both offenses, should lead to a low-scoring Cure Bowl.\n\nNeither offense should score more than 24 points, especially with Old Dominion turning to Henicle after Colton Joseph opted out.\n\nSouth Florida has allowed fewer than 24 points in three of its last four games, reinforcing the case for the Under on Old Dominion’s team total.\n\nI also trust the largely intact Monarchs' defense to keep this contest within one score, allowing ODU to stay competitive and its offense to cover the number.\n\nOld Dominion team total Under 24.5\n\nSpread: Old Dominion +3.5 (-110) | South Florida -3.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Old Dominion +138 | South Florida -164\n\nOver/Under: Over 53.5 (-110) | Under 53.5 (-110)\n\nOld Dominion has hit the Game Total Under in their last five games (+5.00 Units / 91% ROI).

    "description": "My first stay at a Ritz-Carlton resort was at the Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón in Florida. The luxury hotel chain had some surprising amenities.",
    "fullText": "When I arrived at the Ritz-Carlton, Naples, my reservation was nowhere to be found. I was riddled with anxiety until an employee informed me that I was at the wrong location.\n\nMy stay was about five miles east at the Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón. I didn't realize the city had two locations, and I was surprised to find out they were so close to each other.\n\nGuests of each Ritz-Carlton have access to all amenities at both locations, and a shuttle service runs between them. I was stoked because I'd never stayed at a hotel with this perk.\n\nAfter spending some time at each, I found that the resorts offered completely different experiences.\n\nWhile both were extremely luxurious, the Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón was centered on golf, while the Ritz-Carlton, Naples was on the beach. The former was quieter and seemed to cater to an older crowd, while the latter felt busier with a wide range of ages.\n\nI appreciated being able to spend the day at the bustling beach resort and retiring to the calmer Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón.\n\nI've never held a putter outside mini golf, so I wasn't expecting to be at all interested in the hotel's two courses. Then I learned that they host three pro tournaments every year, according to the company's website.\n\nEven though golf isn't my thing, I instantly got excited for guests who love it. As a baseball fan, I thought about how elated I'd be by the opportunity to play at a major league stadium. So I ended up really appreciating the golf courses at the Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón.\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón isn't just for golfers. The hotel has a small water park next to the pool area with tall, winding slides and a lazy river.\n\nI'd stayed at hotels that had water slides before, but I'd never even heard of one with a lazy river. I'm not much of a thrill seeker, so I was excited to partake in a leisurely water activity. I hopped into an inflatable tube and looked up at the palm trees swaying in the breeze as I floated around the shady loop.\n\nOn my second day in Naples, I took the shuttle to the hotel chain's other location on the beach. When I stepped inside, I was stunned by the most beautiful bar I'd ever seen in a hotel lobby.\n\nRenovated in 2023, RITZ Lobby Bar was designed to feel celebratory, according to the hotel's website. And I think they nailed it.\n\nDainty light fixtures dangled from the ceiling above, arched windows flooded the room with light, and gold accents brought the room together.\n\nAs a lover of boutique hotels and unique stays, I didn't expect to be blown away by the Ritz-Carlton. But since two locations in the same city offered completely different experiences, I'm intrigued to see what other Ritz-Carlton resorts are like.",

Animals that survived the hurricane were moved to a larger area.\n\nIn 1991, the zoo ruins reopened as gardens with the goal \"not to destroy everything,\" Kevin Asher, a planner for the county, told the Miami Herald.\n\nI visited the park in October 2021 to see what remained of the abandoned zoo, and I found a natural wildlife sanctuary.\n\nAccording to Atlas Obscura, the ruins are also home to wild alligators, iguanas, and peacocks.\n\nParts of the park were paved, while other parts felt like the wild. Some of the lands were once a coconut plantation, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nI thought it looked like it could have been a unique, immersive attraction and wondered what animals may have lived there decades ago.\n\nI peered over high, chain-linked fences and spotted remnants of vandalized structures.\n\nIt appeared to once house multiple cages.\n\nI was able to see inside a few of the animals' quarters, which were now empty aside from some leaves, branches, and overgrown vines. The doors were still locked.\n\nI tried to imagine what kind of animals could live in these spaces. Based on their size, maybe monkeys, I thought.\n\nAfter my visit, the zoo celebrated its 75th anniversary of serving the community in November 2022, according to CBS Miami.",

    "title": "‘Idiot’ Kyle Rittenhouse ripped as a joke by Florida sheriff: ‘I am so disgusted’",
    "description": "The sheriff claims that Rittenhouse is trying to make money off an incident in his county.",
    "fullText": "Kyle Rittenhouse returned to social media this week, and he is already drawing the ire of at least one sheriff in Florida.\n\nRittenhouse, who shot three people, killing two, during a racial injustice protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 2020, claimed self-defense and was acquitted of all charges. He remains controversial, though, and his new gig appears to be attempting to call out incidents that he believes are Second Amendment issues.\n\nThat led him to share a video on Friday standing in front of the Walton County Jail while claiming that Michael Rediker “used Florida’s ‘Stand Your Ground’ law to lawfully defend himself when his life was put in jeopardy.”\n\n“Michael did nothing wrong, and he deserves all our support,” Rittenhouse said in the video which he pinned to his X page.\n\n“We are expecting an outright not guilty under Florida’s Stand Your Ground law,” he added.\n\nWalton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson did not take kindly to Rittenhouse’s claims. He reshared the video via the Walton County Sheriff Office’s official X account, and issued a video of his own scathing response.\n\n“I don’t normally do this,” Adkinson said. “I don’t normally take the time to speak to public comments on cases, certainly not open cases. But in this particular situation, a murder that occurred yesterday in Walton County, I feel compelled to respond to what I can only call wildly irresponsible. I would say motivated by many factors, none of them in the interest of justice in which individuals, particularly Kyle Rittenhouse and his attorney, Anthony Sabatini, are attempting to frame the murder here in Walton County on Thursday of Mr. Keen as a Stand Your Ground case or wrapping it in the Constitution or that it is Second Amendment case.”\n\n“After 30-something years of doing this, I very rarely get personally offended, but I’m actually just kind of disgusted with them,” the sheriff continued. “There was a man who lost his life yesterday. A father, a husband with two small children, who was murdered, unarmed on his own property, unprovoked by an individual who drove a tractor over a half a mile onto the victim’s property. Once there, batters his wife in front of eyewitnesses. When the husband, whom there had been no confrontation with, gets out to come over and help pick his wife up off the ground the suspect shoots him in the face. He was unarmed. There was no fight between them. There was no attack, and as he is laying dying on the ground, this suspect, Michael Rediker, stood over him and made some comments for which he is going to answer to in court. At the same time, he committed aggravated assault on multiple other people because he murdered this man in front of witnesses that watched this as this man was murdered. Again, unarmed, on his own property, after his wife had been battered, and no confrontation.\n\n“Now, somehow out of that, Mr. Rittenhouse and his attorney, Anthony Sabatini, have determined that this is the great Stand Your Ground case,” Adkinson continued. “Well, I’ll tell you this. I’ll bet my badge on this. Not only is that not a stand your ground, Mr. Rediker will face either the ultimate penalty in the state of Florida or God willing the rest of his natural life in prison. Because, come Christmas morning in two weeks, there are two little boys elementary school age, two children, that are not going to have their father, and there’s a wife whose not going to have her husband all so these two idiots can get more likes on their Facebook and call it a Constitutional issue.”\n\n“I’m actually just disgusted with @rittenhouse2a and @AnthonySabatini. A man lost his life yesterday. A father. A husband. With two small children. Who was murdered, unarmed, on his own property unprovoked by an individual who drove a tractor a half a mile onto the victim’s… https://t.co/HQbexbApzO pic.twitter.com/y6t7lGMKOd\n\n— Walton County Sheriff's Office, Florida (@WCSOFL) December 13, 2025\n\n“I think both of you are jokes, and I don’t think you should make a damn cent off the suffering of someone else,” he said. “So, if you don’t like that, well you can file that under I don’t really give a damn. I know people aren’t’ going to like this, and I don’t care about that either. I’m so disgusted and sad for the Keen family and their loss and the fact that these two yo-yos are going to try to make money and news on it. And I probably shouldn’t give them this, but I think the public deserves to know this doesn’t have a damn thing to do with the Second Amendment or Stand Your Ground. So, I hope that many of you will reach out and tell these two jack-wagons what you think about what they are doing to this family suffering.\n\n“Don’t let them make on penny off a like.”\n\nWMBB reported that Rediker, 44, was arrested on Thursday and charged with one count of open murder, battery, and three counts of aggravated battery.\n\nRittenhouse made headlines this week when he returned to social media after leaving in June and sharing some big news.\n\n“I’m back on social media, I’m back in the fight, and I’m here to stay,” he wrote on X alongside a pair of photos of himself with a girl.\n\nHe then explained what that was all about.\n\n“For a quick update, 6 months ago I made the best decision of my life and married my best friend,” he wrote. “(Bella Rittenhouse), I couldn’t be happier. I love you beautiful.”\n\nShe replied back, “I love you!”\n\nOne of his followers replied, “Couldn’t be happier for you Kyle. To have your entire world upended and fight through it. Dude, that’s awesome.”\n\n“I’m still being sued for $20 million,” Rittenhouse replied. “But thankfully the Lord provides.”\n\nRittenhouse made several more posts during the day, including one where he said that the assassination of Charlie Kirk convinced him he “couldn’t sit on the sidelines anymore.”\n\n“So I’m back,” he wrote. “Not quietly. Not halfway. I’m coming back in a big way.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMIAMI, Florida, Dec. 12 — The Northwestern [Miami, FL] Bulls roll into Florida's FHSAA Class 3A title Friday evening with a 23-game win streak and an undefeated 13-0 record as they look to defend their 2024 state championship at Florida International University's Pitbull Stadium.\n\nTheir opponent will look very familiar as they'll face the same Raines [Jacksonville, FL] Vikings' squad they beat, 41-0, in last year's title tilt. Raines also sports a 13-0 record headed into the contest.\n\nNorthwestern will be seeking its eight state championship in football while Raines is in the hunt for its fourth football state championship trophy.\n\nGame time is set for 7:30 p.m. EST local.\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:No. 22 Northwestern [Miami, FL] Bulls vs. Raines [Jacksonville, FL] Vikings\n\nThis Raines defense! I've been talking about them all night here, and they get an interception with a big return when Northwestern goes for it on fourth down. After trailing by nine, the Vikings are, amazingly, in business.\n\nWith 7:12 to play, Raines finally has some points from the offense, tacking on a field goal. It's important. It gets this back to a one-score game, and a touchdown and PAT could possibly win it.\n\nThis was never going to be easy for Raines, and it just got a lot harder as the Vikings' defense finally gives up its first touchdown. Northwestern back firmly in control in a two-score game now.\n\nWell, Raines has finally scored against Northwestern, but it's the only 7 points they have in seven quarters against this Northwestern team the past two years. But, the difference this year is their defense is keeping this thing close. And that defense might have to go and win this thing for them.\n\nNorthwestern shakes off the interception and drives down into position for another field goal. But these are still small victories for the Vikings. They're giving their offense every opportunity to go win this game.\n\nWell, the defense for Raines has been keeping them in this game, and now they've given the Vikings the lead on a long interception return. This is a crazy swing, and in seven quarters of play against Northwestern, this is the first points Raines has managed. But this is no anomaly; this is the Viking's 12th defensive touchdown this year.\n\nNorthwestern adds another field goal, but Raines' defense is playing tough tonight. They're giving the offense a chance if it can ever get on track.\n\nAnd the third quarter is just getting under way!\n\nThis is looking a lot better than last year, but one important number is the same so far – that goose egg on the Vikings' side of the scoreboard. They lost last year's game 41-0, and through two quarters tonight, the offense still hasn't cracked the code against this stout Bulls' defense.\n\nRaines was finally driving deep in Northwestern's territory, helped along by a pass interference penalty. But then they throw an interception near the 5 yard line with 39 seconds to play in the first half.\n\nKhavon Gipson with a clutch interception for Northwestern. Raines was driving. pic.twitter.com/WKTZkhHnnN\n\n— Adam Lichtenstein (@ABLichtenstein) December 13, 2025\n\nNorthwestern was about to score when the running back took a hard lick near the goal line. The ball rolled into the end zone where Raines recovered to take over. The Vikings' defense is bending but not breaking. But they need some help from the offense late in the second quarter.\n\nRaines was pinned deep in its own territory after the turnover on downs. They were forced to punt from their end zone, but Northwestern mishandles the punt, and Raines pounces on it. Northwestern would have had great field position around the Vikings' 30, but instead, the Vikings keep their drive alive.\n\nNorthwestern takes their second drive inside the Raines' 5. On fourth and goal, they go for the first down, but the Vikings' defense forces the turnover on downs!\n\nNorthwestern puts together a solid drive, but Raines' defense stands tall in the shadow of their own end zone to force a field goal.\n\nField goal! @mnw_fb scores first.

The two appearances in the title game are the only times that West Boca Raton has advanced to the final in school history.\n\nBut West Broward's appearance will mark its debut in Florida's championship finals history. The Bobcats were 9-4 a year ago, losing in the regional finals in a 51-21 rout at the hands of the Southridge [Miami, FL] Spartans. They avenged that loss two weeks ago in a 30-27 win over the Spartans, and then cleared the final hurdle last week in a 24-17 win over the Buchholz [Gainesville, FL] Bobcats.\n\nGame time is set for 12:30 p.m. EST local\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:West Boca Raton [Boca Raton, FL] Bulls vs. West Broward [Pembroke Pines, FL] Bobcats\n\nWell, this game got away from West Broward pretty quick in the second quarter. West Boca adds a field goal just before the half, and the Bobcats have a lot of work to do just to get back into this thing.\n\nWell, after a long stretch with no scoring, West Boca is finding its groove on both sides of the ball. This time, the Bulls force a fumble, and Tray Mitchell goes 60 yards on the scoop and score. Suddenly, West Broward finds itself in a two-touchdown hole, and that's big against a team like West Boca.\n\nJavian Mallory goes the distance from 50 yards to put the favored Bulls out front on the scoreboard.\n\nIt feels like these two Florida heavyweights are still feeling each other out, exploring ways to gain the early momentum. It's a fast-moving game with few stoppages due in part to the lack of scoring, of course.\n\nIt's been a fast-moving first quarter with no offensive fireworks, yet. They're in a timeout with less than a minute to play in the opening quarter in a game that is still scoreless.\n\nFlorida's FHSAA Class 6A title game is under way in Miami, Florida!

    "fullText": "DENVER — It’s been a recurring theme throughout Nathan MacKinnon’s brilliant career — and on Thursday night, he made history again.\n\nWith his 25th goal of the season, MacKinnon passed Joe Sakic to become the all-time leading goal scorer in Colorado Avalanche history, helping propel the Avs to a dominant 6–1 win over the reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers. MacKinnon finished the night with a goal and an assist.\n\nBrock Nelson, Gavin Brindley, and Sam Malinski each contributed a goal and an assist for Colorado, while Artturi Lehkonen and Gabe Landeskog also found the back of the net. Josh Manson added two assists, and Mackenzie Blackwood turned aside 22 shots.\n\nNATHAN MACKINNON SNIPE THROUGH TRAFFIC #GoAvsGo pic.twitter.com/ZEp5b0Vu9m\n\n— PrimeMakar8 (@retro_colorado) December 12, 2025\n\nNoah Gregor and Mackie Samoskevich scored for Florida. Daniil Tarasov had a difficult night in goal, surrendering six goals on 42 shots — including three in a lopsided second period.\n\nMalinski opened the scoring just 1:14 into the game, taking a pass from Necas in the right circle and snapping a wrister that slipped off Tarasov’s glove and in.\n\nThrough six minutes, Colorado held a 7–1 advantage in shots. Florida capitalized on its second shot of the night when Gregor broke into the zone off a feed from Seth Jones, accelerated down the left wing, and beat his former San Jose Sharks teammate Blackwood short side. Devon Toews and Samuel Girard were a step late closing in, and the game was tied.\n\nCarter Verhaeghe went to the box for slashing Parker Kelly into the boards, but the Avalanche failed to convert on the power play.\n\nParker Kelly gets slashed and crashes into the boards.\n\nCarter Verhaeghe will go to the box. Avs on the power play. #goavsgo #avs @TheHockeyNews\n\n— Ryan O'Hara (@OHaraSports) December 12, 2025\n\nColorado found itself shorthanded with 6:41 left after Manson hooked Eetu Luostarinen, who was staring at an open net off a rebound. It was a smart penalty to take, and the Avs killed it off to the delight of the crowd.\n\nNelson restored the lead with 1:30 left in the period, cleaning up a rebound from a Cale Makar shot that bounced off Tarasov. It was Nelson’s twelfth of the season and gave Colorado a 2–1 advantage.\n\nAt 5:06 of the middle frame, Brindley scored in his return from a 10-game absence due to a lower-body injury. Brent Burns released the initial shot, and Brindley buried the rebound to make it 3–1.\n\nGAVIN BRINDLEY!!!!!!!! \n\n3-1 AVS!!!#goavsgo #avs @TheHockeyNews\n\n— Ryan O'Hara (@OHaraSports) December 12, 2025\n\nNot long after, MacKinnon collected a pass from Girard and snapped his twenty-fifth goal of the year over Tarasov’s glove, extending the lead.\n\nLehkonen made it 5–1 on a breakaway, finishing five-hole after being sprung by Toews and Brindley.\n\nLehkonen nearly scored again with 4:41 left when he one-timed a feed from MacKinnon, but Tarasov smothered it in the chest. Lehkonen stared up at the rafters in disbelief.\n\nColorado earned another power play after Niko Mikkola was called for holding, though the Avs could not cash in. The officials missed a clear tripping call on Nelson when Verhaeghe took his legs out in the dying seconds of the man advantage.\n\nFlorida was soon back in the box anyway, as Samoskevich tripped Brindley. Necas appeared to score on the ensuing power play, but the goal was overturned for offside. Colorado carried a four-goal lead into the intermission with fifty-two seconds remaining on the man advantage.\n\nVerhaeghe had a goal wiped out nearly five minutes into the period after officials ruled he deliberately kicked the puck in. The review was brief and the call stood.\n\nLandeskog made it 6–1 at 6:18, jamming in a loose puck after Josh Manson’s shot was redirected by Necas and bounced off Tarasov’s pad. Landeskog jumped on the rebound at the back door and finished the play.\n\nREBOUND SCORE!!!\n\nIt's GABE LANDESKOG\n\n6-1 Colorado#goavsgo #avs @thehockeynews\n\n— Ryan O'Hara (@OHaraSports) December 12, 2025\n\nSamoskevich scored with just under seven minutes remaining in regulation on a beautiful sequence set up by crisp passes from A.J. Greer and Evan Rodrigues, cutting the deficit to 6–2.\n\nJoel Kiviranta suffered an upper-body injury and will be evaluated, though Coach Jared Bednar told reporters after the game that it’s “nothing too serious.”\n\nA.J. Greer also left late for the Panthers after suffering an injury and was taken to the medical tent. No further updates were provided.\n\nGavin Brindley, Nathan MacKinnon, and Brock Nelson were named the three stars of the game.\n\nThe NHL-leading Colorado Avalanche (22-2-7) square off against the Nashville Predators (15-13-2) on Saturday at Ball Arena.

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Catch by catch, Kyle Pitts Sr. put the mistake-prone Atlanta Falcons on his back and carried them to a thrilling comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThursday night got even better for the fifth-year pro when the former University of Florida star learned his 11-reception, 166-yard, three-touchdown performance that keyed a 29-28 win was the most productive game by an NFL tight end in nearly three decades.\n\nThe previous tight end to finish with at least 10 catches, 150 yards receiving and three TDs in a game was Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in 1996.\n\nThe 25-year-old Pitts noted he wasn't even born yet back then.\n\n“Man, I love the state of Florida,” the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Pitts said as he stepped up to the podium in the visiting interview room at Raymond James Stadium.\n\n“It means a lot,” he added about the mention of Sharpe. “It's a great person to be (compared to).”\n\nKurt Cousins targeted Pitts a team-high 12 times, leaning heavily on the young tight end with leading receiver Drake London out with a knee injury. Pitts scored on receptions of 8, 17 and 7 yards, the latter trimming what had once been a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 28-26 with 3:34 remaining.\n\nHis last catch, on third-and-28 from the Atlanta 29, was for 14 yards. Cousins threw 21 yards to David Sills V on fourth-and-14 to set up Zane Gonzalez's 43-yard game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n“It was the plan, you know, all along. Kyle is our guy,” second-year Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. “You're down a couple of your guys like Drake, some of those guys, and Kyle has really filled in that role and become the lead dog guy. He has done an awesome job.”\n\nThe Falcons (5-9) are eliminated from playoff contention, but they relished the opportunity to play spoiler against the division-rival Bucs (7-7), who are trying to win the NFC South for the fifth straight season.\n\n“It's amazing. I mean, we've been having our ups and downs through the year,” Pitts said. “Obviously, it's not fun being eliminated early, but we're resilient. ... It was just pretty fun to get that win.”\n\nThe Falcons overcame a team-record 19 penalties for 125 yards. They also withstood a wide-open Sills dropping what would have been a go-ahead TD catch in the third quarter, as well as Bijan Robinson's third-quarter fumble that led to the touchdown that put Tampa Bay up by two scores early in the fourth.\n\n“It's a steppingstone to where we want to go,” Morris said. “We talked about this, building blocks for what we've got to do. What we're talking about is next year. ... Only thing we can do right now is finish.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

The redux was a lot closer as the Raiders were only able to muster up three DiSalvatore field goals in the first half.\n\nA reason Lakeland was able to remain in the contest was the play of quarterback Keelin Hendrix, who was making plays with his arm and legs all throughout the evening. Hendrix finished the night totaling 226 all-purpose yards.\n\nThe mtachup the last two seasons between the two perennial powers hasn’t been all too close, with St. Thomas Aquinas edging Lakeland by a combined 63-0 score.\n\nFor Florida high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

A line of text that was discovered references a voice line for the character Jimmy, the son of main character Michael, that says he is \"moving out of state.\" Another line, from his mother Amanda, says, \"Our son is finally moving away from home.\" People are taking this to suggest that Jimmy may have moved to Leonida, the stand-in for GTA 6's setting of Florida, but that's just conjecture for now.",

Ron DeSantis on Monday designated one of the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy groups in the U.S. a “foreign terrorist organization,” following a similar step by Texas last month.\n\nThe directive against the Council on American-Islamic Relations comes in an executive order DeSantis posted on the social media site X. It also gives the same label to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nNeither CAIR nor the Muslim Brotherhood is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government.\n\nThe order instructs Florida agencies to prevent the two groups and those who have provided them material support from receiving contracts, employment and funds from a state executive or cabinet agency.\n\nIn an emailed statement, CAIR and its Florida chapter said the organization plans to sue DeSantis in response to what it called an “unconstitutional” and “defamatory” proclamation.\n\nFounded in 1994, CAIR has 25 chapters around the country.\n\nCAIR last month asked a federal judge to strike down Texas Gov.

Its leaders say it renounced violence decades ago and seeks to set up Islamic rule through elections and other peaceful means. Critics, including autocratic governments across the Middle East region, view it as a threat.",

    "fullText": "STARKE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of stabbing a woman to death during a home invasion robbery more than 30 years ago is scheduled to be executed Tuesday evening in Florida.\n\nMark Allen Geralds, 58, is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke. Geralds was convicted of murder, armed robbery, burglary and stealing a car and was sentenced to death in 1990. The Florida Supreme Court later vacated the sentence but affirmed the conviction, and Geralds was resentenced to death in 1992.\n\nIt would be Florida's 18th death sentence carried out in 2025, further extending the state record for total executions in a single year.\n\nAccording to court records, Tressa Pettibone’s 8-year-old son found his mother beaten and stabbed to death on the kitchen floor of their Panama City home in February 1989. Geralds was a carpenter who had previously done remodeling work at the home.\n\nGeralds ran into Pettibone and her children at a shopping mall about a week before the killing, and Pettibone mentioned that her husband was away on business. Geralds later approached Pettibone's son at the video arcade and asked when the boy's father would return and what time he and his sister left for and returned from school each day, according to court records.\n\nInvestigators found that Geralds pawned jewelry with traces of Pettibone’s blood on it, and plastic ties used to bind Pettibone matched ties found in Geralds’ car.\n\nAfter a death warrant was signed last month and his execution date set, Geralds told a judge he did not wish to pursue any further appeals. The judge signed off on that decision.\n\nA total of 44 men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and a handful of executions are scheduled for the rest of the year.\n\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, the highest previous annual total of Florida executions was eight in 2014. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year. Another execution is planned for next week in the state under death warrants signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nFrank Athen Walls, 58, is scheduled for Florida’s 19th execution this year on Dec. 18. He was convicted of fatally shooting a man and woman during a home invasion robbery and later confessing to three other killings.\n\nFlorida's lethal injections are carried out with a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",

Only employees nominated by their superiors for “exemplary service” were awarded the $10,000 bonus.\n\nThe TSA employs over 50,000 transportation security officers out of its approximate 65,000 total employees.\n\nThe DHS did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
