    "description": "Florida football defensive tackle Caleb Banks lands with the Chargers in ESPN's latest NFL mock draft after a strong Senior Bowl showing.",
    "fullText": "Former Florida football defensive tackle Caleb Banks is projected to be selected by the Los Angeles Chargers with the No. 22 pick, according to ESPN's latest 2026 NFL mock draft.\n\nAccording to analyst Matt Miller, his reasoning is pretty straightforward: the Chargers need more of a true anchor on the defensive line, and Banks fits the mold as a nose tackle who can hold ground against the run while still bringing some juice as a power rusher.\n\nBanks is listed at 6-feet-6-inches and 339 pounds, and Miller describes him as an \"aggressive bull rusher\" with rare first-step quickness for a guy built like that.\n\nBanks' most recent season with the Gators didn't look normal on paper because he was limited to two games due to a foot injury. That's the type of thing that can quietly stall a prospect's momentum, especially when draft cycles move as fast as they do. But that's also where the Senior Bowl comes in.\n\nHis week in Mobile, Alabama, was well-received by scouts, and it sounds like the practices helped reintroduce him as a disruptor instead of \"the injured guy who missed time.\"\n\nBanks still has plenty of runway left in the pre-draft process, and his medicals and testing will matter a ton. But getting slotted in the first round, even in a mock, is the kind of headline that sticks. It puts Banks firmly in the \"name to know\" tier as draft talk heats up.\n\n\"The run on edge rushers before this pick leaves the Chargers with some interesting decisions. Do they add to an offensive line that was marred by injury in 2025 or try to fix a D-line that still needs a true anchor to help defend the run?\n\n\"With the talent that's left on the board, Banks would be very enticing as the nose tackle Los Angeles is missing. The 6-foot-6, 339-pounder is an aggressive bull rusher with rare first-step quickness for his size. Think Vita Vea, but with better length. Banks missed all but two games last season due to a foot injury, but his Senior Bowl performance was well-received by scouts, who saw the explosive play in the trenches that excited them entering the 2025 season.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nIf you purchase through our links, the USA Today Network may earn a commission.

    "fullText": "Florida football finds itself right in the middle of the SEC pack in CBS Sports' power rankings for the 2026 season, a reflection of both uncertainty and quiet optimism surrounding the program entering Jon Sumrall's first year with the Orange and Blue.\n\nCBS Sports' Brandon Marcello slotted the Gators 10th in the SEC, placing Florida firmly in the conference's crowded middle tier following a chaotic transfer portal cycle and a full coaching reset.\n\nSumrall inherited a group that needed significant turnover, and that context matters. Florida lost key contributors to the portal, rebuilt large portions of its depth chart and is still sorting out several position battles heading into spring practice.\n\nCBS Sports pointed specifically to quarterback uncertainty, noting the compeition between Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo and Tramell Jones Jr. as a storyline that could ultimately swing Florida's ceiling one way or another.\n\nIt's simply too early to make definitive judgements. Spring practices, sumeer development and continued roster movement will reshape the conference landscape before fall arrives. For Florida, that means the current ranking by CBS Sports should be viewed more as a snapshot than a verdict.\n\nFor now, the Gators are positioned as a team with something to prove.\n\nHere is everything Marcello wrote about Florida and why he ranked them at No. 10 in the SEC power rankings.\n\n\"Jon Sumrall arrives with a major rebuild on his hands in Gainesville. The former Tulane and Troy coach has never won less than 10 games in a single season, but make sure to temper your expectations for Year 1 in the SEC. He had to overhaul a roster depleted by transfers, and we don't quite know what to expect with Georgia Tech transfer Aaron Philo battling Tramell Jones Jr. at quarterback.\n\n\"Still, Sumrall has the magic touch and knows how to build rosters. He also hired a top-tier staff. The Gators could be in the top half of the SEC this season, but we need to see more this spring and summer to better gauge the Gators.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.",

    "fullText": "FORT LAUDERDALE — Panthers star forward Sam Bennett suffered an upper-body injury during Florida’s loss to Buffalo on Monday night. It’s the latest in a series of injuries that have decimated the reigning Stanley Cup champions, who have lost four straight games.\n\n“It seems like somebody’s getting injured every night,” Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk said.\n\nPanthers coach Paul Maurice said Bennett — who was reportedly picked to replace Tampa Bay’s Anthony Cirelli for the Canadian Olympic team on Tuesday — and fellow forwards Anton Lundell and Brad Marchand may be able to play Wednesday against Boston, but the team has not made that determination yet.\n\n“There’s a chance they could all play tomorrow,” Maurice said. “There’s a chance not to play tomorrow, but we won’t know till after the morning skate.”\n\nBennett’s injury meant all four of the Panthers’ centers from last year’s Stanley Cup team — captain Aleksander Barkov, Lundell, Bennett and Tomas Nosek — are hurt. Florida needed winger Eetu Luostarinen to move to center, a position he previously played, to fill the void on Monday.\n\n“He was good; five on two on the draws,” Maurice said Monday. “I like him better on the wing because of what Lundell does, what the two of them can do, but everybody needed to play all over.”\n\nThe growing list of injuries that have plagued Florida all season have not gone unnoticed.\n\n“When you get started blowing up barbecues, you start to think,” Maurice said, referring to Luostarinen suffering an injury while grilling earlier this season. “… But I would say that in everything that’s happened here over the last four years, there’s something to be gleaned out of your adversity.”\n\nMaurice said the team needs to stick to its foundation and stay confident so they avoid pressing. He said the Panthers did that in their loss to Buffalo.\n\n“I think sometimes you’ll sit so defensively because of the urgency and it’s also the foundation of your game,” Maurice said. “But we put up (42 shots) last night and felt we had opportunities to score. So there has to be a certain amount of freedom and ease in your game for the confidence to stay and to make plays because you can’t just (keep) kicking it out into the neutral zone all night. I thought we were good with that last game. Most important thing is you have a foundation. That has to be there first. You can’t lose that ease in your game where you’re too tight to create.”\n\nTkachuk said right now the Panthers just have to grind out close victories.\n\n“We cannot try to outskill teams — and that’s not what we were trying to do — but at some points in the game, we are doing that. We’re just playing into their hands,” Tkachuk said. “… We’ve just got to try to get back to the basics. We’ve got to try to win a 1-0, 2-1 game here and just try to go from there. We’re in one right now, and if we don’t simplify it, this year’s going to get away from us.”\n\nThe Panthers are feeling the urgency of the moment. Florida plays Boston on Wednesday and Tampa Bay on Thursday before the team gets a three-week break for the Olympics. But Tkachuk said the Panthers, who are currently nine points out of a playoff spot, need to turn things around before the break; they cannot wait any longer.\n\n“This could get away from us if we don’t figure it out,” Tkachuk said. “It has to start next game. We’ve got two games left, and Boston’s another team we’re chasing that’s a wild card team, so we’ve got to get it.”",

    "fullText": "Florida basketball's brutal home loss to the Auburn Tigers two weeks ago is well in the rearview mirror after a pair of superlative performances — a 47-point beatdown of the South Carolina Gamecocks on the road, followed by an epic victory in the O'Dome against the Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nAs a result of the Gators' plus-70 margin of victory over the last two games, Todd Golden finds his team up five spots in the latest USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll at No. 16. That puts the Orange and Blue between the No. 15 Vanderbilt Commodores and No. 17 Virginia Cavaliers.\n\nThat kick in the pants at home appears to have given Florida a wake-up call, and now the Gators have put the rest of the SEC — and college basketball — on notice with nine games remaining on the regular-season schedule.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference once again has only four member schools in this week's poll, with Vanderbilt hanging onto their league-high No. 15 ranking. Florida is right behind them at No. 16, followed by the Arkansas Razorbacks, who fell five spots to No. 21, and the Texas A&M Aggies, who entered the rankings for the first time this season at No. 25.\n\nAlabama fell out of the top 25, and now follows the de facto No. 27 Tennessee Volunteers (55 votes) with 15 votes.

    "description": "“We’re probably at like 2,000 iguanas,” said Redline Iguana Removal owner Blake Wilkins.",
    "fullText": "South Florida iguana removal companies were scooping up hundreds of cold-stunned and dead lizards Sunday in a seemingly record-breaking roundup due to the cold snap, according to local business owners.\n\n“We are scooping them up by the dozens,” said Blake Wilkins, owner of Redline Iguana Removal in Hollywood.\n\nIt was 35.1 degrees with a wind chill of 27 around 7 a.m. Sunday at Miami Internation Airport, beating the previous Feb. 1 record low of 36, set in 1909. With those cold temps, the iguana removal business was booming.\n\nIguanas and other reptiles can lose muscle control and go into a state of shock, appearing “frozen,” when temperatures dip near freezing. On Friday, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission lifted its normal restrictions and said that on Sunday and Monday, people could trap the iguanas, a non-native invasive species, and bring them to five FWC offices so they could be humanely killed or transferred to permitted pet operators.\n\nWilkins said his trappers started working from about 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. to take advantage of the weather and had already been to at least 100 locations by Sunday afternoon. At one golf course, Redline Iguana Removal picked up about 100 iguanas within an hour.\n\n“We’re probably at like 2,000 iguanas,” Wilkins said.\n\nThe cold temperatures, combined with the wind knocking the iguanas out of trees, created a “kind of double factor,” he said, adding that he had dodged a falling iguana earlier.\n\nWilkins said he’s been removing iguanas for a decade, and this is definitely the strongest cold front with the most frozen iguanas he’s seen. About 50% of the iguanas removed were dead.\n\n“I’d say it happens every year but not to this magnitude,” he said. “This is a strong one, for sure.”\n\nThe company truck was “absolutely stacked” with cold-stunned and dead iguanas, and the calls for removal will continue Monday, he said.\n\n“It may be kind of gruesome for people, but it’s a good idea of what we’ve gotten,” Wilkins said.\n\nSteve Kavashansky, owner of Iguana Busters in West Palm Beach, joked that he was doing much better than the iguanas were on Sunday. His business offers removal from Jupiter to just north of Miami.\n\nThe calls for removal across South Florida have been nonstop, and Iguana Busters hasn’t had time to take on new customers because it’s so busy, Kavashansky said. By around 2 p.m., his trappers were on their 45th call of the day.\n\nHis company had collected close to 150 iguanas, and the majority of them were cold-stunned rather than dead, he said. From his experience, the iguanas have been acclimating to the cooler temperatures over the years.\n\n“Last year, we maybe had five, maybe 10 calls, and that was over the whole winter,” Kavashansky said. “This year, just today alone, we are up to 45 calls.”\n\nWhile the FWC designated locations for members of the public to drop off captured, cold-stunned iguanas on Sunday and Monday, Kavashansky said he would not recommend picking them up.\n\nThe FWC did not respond to a request for comment on how many iguanas were turned over Sunday in South Florida.\n\nA couple of years ago, one woman picked up a stunned iguana and put it in her car, Kavashansky said. The iguana woke up as it warmed up, whipped her with its tail, and she crashed.\n\n“If you’re not trained to deal with these animals, I wouldn’t do it,” he said.",

    "fullText": "The blueberry and strawberry fields at Southern Hill Farms were buried in chunks of ice.\n\nWhile it can look picturesque amid the morning sun, it can also be catastrophic to the plants – and the farmers' business.\n\nThe plants were sprayed with light water overnight to create a thin ice layer, which helps to protect the plants. Too much ice, however, can cause the plants to break and topple over.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nCLERMONT, Fla. - In the light of day, it looks like a glass forest. Every leaf, every branch, and every fruit in this Lake County field is encased in a thick, translucent armor.\n\nBut for the farmers here, this isn’t a winter wonderland.\n\nThe owners and staff at Southern Hill Farms in Clermont, Florida, did not sleep – staying awake throughout the night to monitor their plants and fields as freezing temperatures hit the area.\n\n\"We knew it was gonna be a terrible night. When you make ice at eight o'clock, it's gonna be bad, bad night,\" said David Hill, one of the owners.\n\n\"We've done this a million times when it was a cold event. We run overhead irrigation to either to wash frost off or to freeze, put a protective layer of water, ice around the berry and the plant. Normally, it's 30 degrees, 32 degrees, wind's not real high. The event we had last night was catastrophic.\"\n\nThe ice got too heavy for some of the sprinklers that hover above the fields. So, when the plants became to heavy and fell, the sprinkler systems go with it.\n\n\"We've got overhead irrigation pipes in field and they were, you know, the the plants are all around there and they were solid ice, they would take down the pipes with it,\" the owners said.\n\nSunday night brings more freezing temperatures to the area. The farm closed Saturday and Sunday due to the ice.\n\nWhat's next is to get through the night, evaluate the damage, and then figure out how to move forward.\n\n\"During a freeze event, farmers use overhead irrigation to protect crops by continuously applying water. As that water freezes, it releases heat, creating a protective layer of ice that helps keep plants at a survivable temperature. It’s a delicate balance that requires constant monitoring, long hours, and a whole lot of experience,\" the farm wrote on its Facebook page.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nFOX 35's Jessica Dobson was at Southern Hill Farms on Sunday morning, Feb. 1, 2026. She talked to the owners and gave viewers a first-hand look at the ice. Southern Hill also posted about the ice and freezing temperatures on its Facebook page.",

    "fullText": "Florida State (7-15, 2-8 ACC) was defeated by Clemson (16-7, 7-4 ACC) by a 77-58 score this afternoon at Littlejohn Coliseum.\n\nClemson scored the first four points of the game as the Tigers did a great job forcing Florida State to take tough shots. Sole Williams hit a driving layup for the first Seminole points. Midway through the quarter Clemson hit FSU with a 10-2 run to take a 16-9 lead. Tatum Greene buried a three to end the run. Taylor Johnson-Matthews hit a triple to give Clemson a 21-15 lead going into the second quarter.\n\nThat shot from Johnson-Matthews sparked the Tigers to a 10-1 run that allowed them to take a 28-16 lead. Mari Gerton broke the run with a nifty putback. However, the Tigers were able to stretch the lead to 42-27 at the half.\n\nThe Tigers ended the third quarter on a 10-2 run to take a 60-41 lead into the fourth quarter. From there Clemson cruised to the 77-58 victory.\n\nSole Williams was the only Seminole in double figures with 23 points.\n\nThe story of this game was that Florida State was unable to maintain any offensive continuity. If the Seminoles aren’t hitting threes (5-21 today) the offense really struggles. This is due to the fact that FSU rarely gets easy baskets. There are a couple of reasons for the lack of easy baskets. First, Florida State usually plays one-on-one offense in the frontcourt. This means that unless there is a blow-by, the shot will be contested. Secondly, the Seminoles don’t get many transition buckets (two fast break points today) or second chance points (13 today). These are the two main ways to get easy baskets.\n\nThe Seminoles did hold their own on the boards and they only had 12 turnovers which is a reasonable number. However, it is tough to beat good teams when you shoot so poorly from the field.\n\nThe Seminoles will travel to Raleigh, NC to face NC State on Thursday. The game will tip at 8pm and will be broadcast on the ACC Network.",

Tommy Tuberville’s eligibility to run for governor of Alabama, accusing the football coach-turned-politician of not meeting the legal requirement to have lived in the state for seven years.  Ken McFeeters, who is running against Tuberville for the Republican nomination for governor, filed the challenge Tuesday with the Alabama Republican Party.",
    "fullText": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A Republican opponent is challenging U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s eligibility to run for governor of Alabama, accusing the football coach-turned-politician of not meeting the legal requirement to have lived in the state for seven years.\n\nKen McFeeters, who is running against Tuberville for the Republican nomination for governor, filed the challenge Tuesday with the Alabama Republican Party. McFeeters in a phone interview said he believes Tuberville lives in a multimillion-dollar beach home in Florida instead of a smaller home that he has listed as his residence in Auburn, Alabama.\n\nProperty tax records show the former Auburn University football coach has a home in Auburn, Alabama ,with an appraised value of $291,780 on which he claims a homestead exemption. He also has a beach home in Walton County, Florida with an estimated market value of $5.5 million, according to property records.\n\nThe Auburn house was initially purchased by Tuberville’s wife and son in 2017. The senator's name was later added to the property, and the son's name removed. Both the Auburn and Florida homes appear to have recently been put in a revocable trust with Tuberville's wife as trustee.\n\n“It’s belittling to the average person in Alabama for him to think we believe that he’s being sincere when he says he lives at his son’s $300,000 house when he’s got a $6 million beach house. Where would you live?” McFeeters said.\n\nMcFeeters wrote in his letter to party officials that the available records, “if accurate, strongly suggest that Auburn may have been used as an address of convenience rather than as a true domicile.” McFeeters said Tuberville’s travel records also show frequent travel to the Florida Panhandle, which he said buttresses the idea that he resides in the location.\n\nMallory Jaspers, a spokeswoman for Tuberville, called the challenge a “ridiculous PR stunt from a desperate candidate.”\n\n“Senator Tuberville has proudly represented Alabama in the United States Senate for the past six years. This made-up narrative didn’t work when he was running for Senate in 2019, and it certainly isn’t going to work now,” Jaspers wrote in an email. Jaspers said the Auburn home remains the senator’s primary residence.\n\nTuberville faced similar accusations in his Senate campaign. Opponents called him “Florida man” or a “tourist in Alabama.” The Senate has a less stringent residency requirement before taking office.\n\nTuberville told The Associated Press earlier this month that he believes he meets the residency requirement.\n\n“We checked it out. I wouldn’t be doing this if I thought it was a problem,” Tuberville said. Tuberville said it will be up to the Republican Party to decide any challenge, but “what I’ve heard from them, they feel good about it.”\n\nTuberville was the head football coach at Auburn University from 1999 to 2008. He then coached at Texas Tech and the University of Cincinnati. He went to work for ESPN after retiring from coaching. In a 2017 promotional video for ESPN, he talked about moving to Florida after retiring from coaching.\n\nTuberville voted in Florida in 2018. He registered to vote in Alabama on March 28, 2019, about two weeks before announcing his run for Senate.\n\nJeannie Burniston, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Republican Party, said challenges are heard and decided by the party’s 21-member steering committee. Burniston said the committee will decide if there is enough evidence for a challenge to proceed to a hearing where both sides present evidence. Burniston said she cannot comment on challenges.\n\nThe awkwardly worded requirement in the Alabama Constitution says the governor and lieutenant governor “shall have been citizens of the United States ten years and resident citizens of this state at least seven years next before the date of their election.”\n\nMcFeeters said it is important that the Republican Party take the matter seriously. He said Tuberville should be asked to provide clear evidence that he has lived in Alabama for seven consecutive years.\n\nSusan Pace Hamill, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, said the language of the residency requirement is vague. She said it could be interpreted to be seven consecutive years or it could be seven years broken up by periods living elsewhere. But she said Alabama’s culture and history supports the argument that it should be seven consecutive years.\n\n“Alabama’s culture is suspicious of outsiders and historically most of Alabama’s governors were born and raised in the state, often having been descended from generations of Alabamians,” Hamill wrote in an email. Her comments were first reported by the Alabama Reflector.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — Winter's brutal grip on the U.S. East is not letting up, with coming days bringing subfreezing temperatures that will plunge deep into what had been a toasty Florida peninsula and a powerful blizzard forecast that may strike the Atlantic coast.\n\nDeep cold is forecast to stick around at least into the first week of February. Meteorologists are also watching what could become a “ bomb cyclone ” — a quickly intensifying storm that’s a winter version of a hurricane — forming off the Carolinas Friday night into Saturday.\n\n“A major winter storm appears to be coming to the Carolinas,” said meteorologist Peter Mullinax of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThat storm could dump snow — at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) with white-out conditions — in the Carolinas, northern Georgia and southern Virginia. After that, it could turn and plow through the Interstate 95 corridor late Saturday into Sunday to dump loads more snow from Washington to Boston, further paralyzing much of the country. Or it could deliver a glancing blow, mostly striking places like Cape Cod.\n\nAlternatively, it could just veer off harmlessly to sea. Meteorologists and forecast models aren't yet settling on a single outcome.\n\n“The confidence is much higher that in the coastal Carolinas and Virginia that there will be significant snowfall this weekend,” said James Belanger, vice president for meteorology at the Weather Channel and its parent company. \"The real question is going to be the trajectory it takes” from there.\n\nPrivate meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former NOAA chief scientist, said for the mid-Atlantic and north it's a “boom or bust” situation. “If it happens (to go along the coast) it's going to be a big-time event.\"\n\nModels still disagree on storm track\n\nOn Tuesday forecast models were all over the place, from out to sea to inward toward Philadelphia. By Wednesday morning they started to agree that “we’re likely to see some form of a powerful coastal storm somewhere east of North Carolina, off the Delmarva coast, but they still disagree as to where,” Mullinax said.\n\nChances of the storm veering away from the East Coast entirely had diminished Wednesday morning, but hadn't disappeared altogether, Mullinax said.\n\nOf all the options, “from D.C. up to New York is probably the most unclear,” Mullinax said. He said a mere 50-mile (80-kilometer) difference in the storm's center will be critical. AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said it may be hard for the southern mid-Atlantic to avoid some kind of snow, whether a little or a lot.\n\nThis storm will blow harder than the last one\n\nThis weekend's storm will differ from the previous storm, which started with moist air from the Pacific that combined with a deep plunge of Arctic air from an elongated polar vortex supplemented by more moisture from the south and east, meteorologists said. The last storm had little wind. This one will generate high winds, even if the snow misses the Washington area, generating gusts that could still reach 40 mph (65 kph), plunging wind chills near subzero Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius), Mullinax said.\n\n“It looks like a pretty strong and explosive storm so everybody is going to have some gusty winds,\" Pydynowski said, even inland places that won't come close to getting snow like Pittsburgh. Strong winds may take daytime temperatures in the teens there down to feeling like they are below zero, he said.\n\n“This is what we'd consider more of a classic nor'easter,” Belanger said, describing a storm forming around the U.S. Gulf Coast crossing into the Atlantic and going up that coast.\n\nFrigid air and warm water combine to make strong storm\n\nIn this case, one key is warmer-than-normal water in the Gulf of Mexico — partly from human-caused climate change — and the always toasty Atlantic Gulf Stream, said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist for the nonprofit Climate Central.\n\nWhen that happens the storm “pulls in more moisture and it gives it more strength,” she said.\n\nOnce the core of the storm nears the Carolinas its pressure will drop tremendously, enough to qualify for what meteorologists call “bombogenesis” or “a bomb cyclone,” That will give it the effect of a moderate-strength hurricane, including huge winds, but in the winter, Maue and Belanger said.\n\nIf the storm does come ashore, those winds and extra snow could cause massive snow drifts big enough to bury cars, Maue said.\n\nArctic chill sticks around and goes further south\n\nWhat is more certain is that the Arctic chill in the Midwest and East will continue through mid-February, with only slight warmups that would still be below normal, meteorologists said.\n\nAnd this new weekend storm “is going to take that cold and it's going to spill right down the heart of the Florida peninsula,\" Pydynowski said. Orlando is forecast to go well below freezing and only have a high of 48 F (9 C), smashing temperature records, while even Miami and Key West will flirt with record cold Sunday and Monday, meteorologists said.\n\nThe outlook for Florida was cold enough to raise concerns about damage to the state’s citrus and strawberries.\n\n“We're going into a brutally cold period,” Maue said.\n\nAfter this weekend storm, long-range models see another one at the end of the first week of February, Maue said. Meteorologists see the East stuck in a pattern of bitter cold and snowstorms because of the plunging Arctic air and warm water.\n\nEast Coast snowstorms don't happen too often, but “when it happens, it happens in bunches,\" said former National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini, who has written meteorology textbooks on winter snowstorms.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "A professional python hunter in Florida needed assistance from family members to uncoil a giant Burmese python from his body and to ultimately subdue the second-heaviest python ever caught in Florida.\n\nCarl Jackson, who is a contracted python hunter with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, was traveling back on Turner River Road in Big Cypress National Park in the afternoon on Jan. 13 when he noticed Burmese python tracks across the road over his truck tracks, as reported by Naples News.\n\nThey appeared to be tracks from a smaller snake, perhaps an 8-footer, tops.\n\n“I go in [to the bushes] and walk around and I see a head,” Jackson told Naples News.\n\nHe immediately recognized that this was not a small snake.\n\nJackson began wrestling with the huge python, which dragged him an estimated 10 to 15 feet over a red and black ant hill.\n\n“It was like riding a slow horse,” Jackson, 43, told Naples News.\n\nJackson relied upon his team to uncoil the snake from around his body several times. His team included his wife, Tasha, and adopted kids, Ryker Young, 20, and Jazzlyn Bateman, 16, all of whom just the day before became certified assistants in the FWC’s Python Action Team, Removing Invasive Constrictors program.\n\nThe python wound up being the second-heaviest python ever caught in Florida at 202 pounds. The record is 215 pounds caught in 2022.\n\nJackson’s python was a 16-foot, 10-inch female, which had been carrying 200 eggs.\n\nAlso on FTW Outdoors: Woman awakes to find python on her chest, ‘don’t move’\n\n“That means more to me because that is 200 potential deer and native animal eaters [that were eliminated],” Jackson told Naples News.\n\nSince moving from Utah to hunt pythons last year, Jackson has eliminated 91 pythons, including the longest one among the contracted hunters in 2025—a 17-foot, 10-inch python.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Python drags hunter 15 feet over ant hill; ‘like riding a slow horse’",

    "fullText": "Florida state Sen. Ileana Garcia (R), co-founder of Latinas for Trump, blasted President Trump’s immigration crackdown, warning he “will lose the midterms” because of White House adviser Stephen Miller.\n\n“I do think that he will lose the midterms because of Stephen Miller,” Garcia told The New York Times in an interview published Tuesday.\n\nThough Garcia was openly supportive of Trump’s plans to close the border, she placed blame on Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, for the aggressive tactics used during the current crackdown.\n\nHer comments come after federal agents in Minneapolis over the weekend shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti amid a protest against the administration’s immigration action, weeks after an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in the city earlier this month.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti “attacked” federal law enforcement, while Miller described Pretti as “a would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal law enforcement.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday distanced Trump from those remarks, saying she had not heard the president “characterize Mr. Pretti in that way” and deferring to the investigation.\n\n“Distorting, politicizing, slandering – justifying what happened to Alex Pretti contradicts the American values the administration campaigned on.  He was neither a domestic terrorist nor an assassin,” Garcia wrote in a Monday post on the social platform X, responding to Miller’s characterization of the incident.\n\n“Allowing individuals like Stephen Miller, among others, who represent the government and make hard-line decisions, to make such comments will have long term consequences. … This is not what I voted for!” she continued.\n\nGarcia, who rallied support from Latina voters to help get Trump elected in 2016 and served in Trump’s Department of Homeland Security during his first term, has blasted what she last year called “inhumane” tactics to meet deportation goals.\n\nHer comments mark the latest sign of growing frustration with Trump’s immigration handling as fallout from the Minnesota shootings grows, as observers warn the issue could have a lingering impact on November’s high-stakes midterms.",

    "title": "Trump impeachment whistleblower Alexander Vindman launches Democratic Senate campaign in Florida",
    "description": "Vindman, a retired lieutenant colonel now challenging Republican Ashley Moody, testified before Congress about Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
    "fullText": "MIAMI — Democrat Alexander Vindman, the former National Security Council aide who helped trigger President Donald Trump’s first impeachment, announced his Senate campaign in Florida on Tuesday to challenge GOP Sen. Ashley Moody.\n\nVindman’s entrance into the race pulls Trump’s agenda and record to the forefront of the Senate contest in Florida, bringing a national focus to a race in the president’s home state — one now widely seen as Republican-leaning. Democrats have a narrow path to wrest control of the Senate in November, in which they’d have to keep all the seats they currently hold and flip four others.\n\nVindman, born in Ukraine when it was still part of the Soviet Union, was an aide on the NSC during Trump’s first term. He testified before Congress about Trump’s 2019 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the president floated an investigation of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump appeared to tie future U.S. aid to Ukraine’s willingness to launch and announce a probe that would be damaging to Biden.\n\nThe Senate acquitted Trump in that case, and Vindman, an Army combat veteran and lieutenant colonel, was fired from his position with the NSC. Vindman went on to become a vocal Trump critic, published two books and worked as a senior adviser for VoteVets, which helps to elect veterans to public office. He first floated a run for Senate in May 2025 on CBS Miami. He said at the time that he thought the 2026 midterms would be a referendum on Trump.\n\nVindman leans into his run-in with Trump in a campaign video launched Tuesday morning. “This president unleashed a reign of terror and retribution, not just against me and my family, but against all of us,” he said in the two-minute video. “Today, our country is in chaos.”\n\nThe Senate seat in Florida is up in a special election this year, and whoever wins will have to run again in 2028. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed Moody, a former state attorney general, to the Senate when Marco Rubio became Trump’s secretary of State.\n\nMoody has to run for the seat for the first time in November, and appointed senators have a history of faring less well than those who were elected. But Moody already received Trump’s endorsement and is battle-tested statewide, having won her state attorney general races twice, both times by higher margins than DeSantis’ gubernatorial wins.\n\nAny statewide Democratic candidate faces an uphill climb in Florida, given that Republican voters in the state outnumber Democratic voters by around 1.4 million people. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report also classified the Senate seat in Florida as being in the “Solid R” category — the most GOP-friendly ranking available.\n\nMoody, who comes from a prominent legal family and isn’t facing a serious GOP challenger, has Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio on her campaign team. And former Trump campaign co-chair Chris LaCivita has a key role in a super PAC supporting her election.\n\nVindman’s campaign video draws attention to affordability issues that appeared to have had an impact in the better-than-expected showing Democrats had in 2025 races. He also brought attention to higher Obamacare premiums that kicked in this year. Moody — along with most Senate Republicans — didn’t support extending enhanced subsidies for premiums, a decision GOP pollsters previously warned would be unpopular.\n\nIn his campaign video, Vindman accused Moody of having been tapped to the Senate to “be a ‘yes’ vote for Trump and the billionaires.”\n\n“She’s not Florida’s senator,” says Vindman’s narration in the campaign video. “She’s theirs.”\n\nVindman, who lives in Democratic stronghold Broward County, enters an increasingly crowded Democratic primary that includes former Brevard County school board member Jennifer Jenkins; progressive state Rep. Angie Nixon; and Hector Mujica, a Venezuelan-American candidate who previously was head of philanthropy at Google for the Americas.\n\nPolitics are also in Vindman's family. His twin brother, Eugene Vindman, was elected to represent Virginia in Congress in 2024, in the seat formerly held by now-Gov. Abigail Spanberger.",

    "fullText": "I booked my 2-hour, 45-minute flight 10 days before my trip. A basic economy ticket would have cost $150.\n\nThe perks of Delta Comfort include early boarding, a more cushioned seat with extra legroom, reserved overhead bin space, and more miles per dollar spent than in basic economy.\n\nDelta's Boeing 737-800 has 160 seats, including 36 Delta Comfort seats, according to Delta's website.\n\nAs a basic economy regular, I'm used to being among the last to board a flight. It was a nice change to be in boarding zone 3 because I was able to get on the plane right after the first-class passengers.\n\nDelta Comfort seats on the Boeing 737-800 are the same size as basic economy seats. I thought the seats were slightly more comfortable than the standard economy Delta seats I've booked in the past, and I appreciated having two more inches of legroom with a 34-inch seat pitch.\n\nMy seatback entertainment system had a wide variety of movies and TV shows, as well as access to YouTube Music and live TV.\n\nSince my flight was relatively short, I appreciated the search filter for movies under two hours. I stretched out in my open row of seats and watched \"17 Again\" as the sun went down.\n\nSince I was seated toward the front of the plane, I waited less than five minutes to exit after we landed. This final perk was my favorite and sealed the deal for me — Delta Comfort was totally worth the added price.\n\nI'll certainly book the upgraded economy class for future flights.\n\nCorrection: January 27, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misstated the added cost of the upgrade. It was $110 more than basic economy.",

    "description": "‘Things didn't progress the way I would have thought they would’, admitted the 79-year-old after surviving an hours-long armed stand-off with Florida police",
    "fullText": "A 79-year-old woman imprisoned for killing her terminally ill husband as part of a botched murder-suicide pact in 2023 has said she wouldn't do anything differently and is “accepting the consequences.”\n\nIt was three years ago this month that Ellen Gilland of New Smyrna Beach, Florida smuggled her husband Jerry's gun into his hospital room in Daytona Beach and fired a single, fatal shot into his head.\n\nAn hours-long standoff ensued, forcing staff and patients to shelter in place until police officers finally threw a nonlethal explosive device into the room and took Gilland into custody.\n\nA judge ultimately accepted Gilland's claim that her actions had been part of an agreement with her 77-year-old husband, but sentenced her to one year in prison and 12 years on probation due to the disruption and fear she had sown among bystanders.\n\nAsked by Fox 35 Orlando whether she would change her actions now, Gilland insisted: \"There wasn't anything else to do.\"\n\nAccording to reports, Gilland told investigators that three weeks beforehand, she and her husband Jerry — who was 77 years old — had agreed that she would kill him and then herself if his illness got worse.\n\n\"I knew what was coming. I knew how difficult it would be to be without him. Not just my best friend, but all of the things that we did for each other...,” she told Fox 35.\n\n\"In the 76 years before this event happened, I had never been in trouble before in my life, and never planned to hurt anyone ever,” she added.\n\nOf her late husband, whom she had known since middle school, she said: \"He was very supportive, very quiet, very generous. He was a lovely person.\"\n\nGilland said that she brought her husband's old gun to the hospital and sat with him talking for a while, before killing him. Afterwards, though, she found she could not go through with the suicide part of her plan.\n\nWhen hospital staff entered the room, however, Gilland — apparently in a state of extreme distress — pointed the gun at them and told them to leave, beginning an armed standoff with police.\n\n\"Tell me what's going on! I don't want to hurt you!\" one officer can be heard shouting on body cam footage.\n\n\"Things didn't progress the way I would have thought they would,\" Gilland admitted in her later interview.\n\nIn the aftermath, Gilland was initially charged with first degree murder, but her charges were reduced by a grant jury. She ultimately pled no contest to manslaughter with a firearm, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer with a firearm.\n\nOne nurse testified during her trial that he had been forced to quit his job after the killing because he \"didn't feel safe anymore\" at the hospital and regularly \"got nightmares\" due to the incident.\n\nGilland told Fox 35 that she had struggled in prison, suffering a heart attack just six weeks into her sentence due to the stress. She did the rest of her time in the infirmary, before being released in November 2025.\n\n\"Most of the guards were very — not really friendly, but accepting,\" she said. \"There were a few of them that were very rude, and shouting, and name-calling.\"\n\nNow released, Gilland is doing court-ordered community service, and will do so monthly as long as she is physically able. She has recently started working at a local animal shelter, according to Fox 35.\n\n\"I’m accepting the consequences,\" she told the outlet. \"I have to figure out how to survive after this.\"\n\nShe also told the outlet that she would try to live out the rest of her life without her husband, while advocating for some form of assisted suicide to be legalized.\n\n\"I don't want people feeling sorry for me. I did what I did,\" she said.\n\nIf you are experiencing feelings of distress, or are struggling to cope, you can speak to the Samaritans, in confidence, on 116 123 (UK and ROI), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans website to find details of your nearest branchIf you are based in the USA, and you or someone you know needs mental health assistance right now, call or text 988, or visit 988lifeline.org to access online chat from the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

    "fullText": "Sarasota (Fla.) Cardinal Mooney quarterback Davin Davidson made a splash at the Elite 11 Miami Regional earlier this month and his recruitment is now exploding.\n\nHis offer sheet has quickly expanded and Power Four programs continue to join the list. Michigan State and Louisville both offered on Monday.\n\nDavidson visited Florida over the weekend, left with an offer and was then visited by Gators head coach Jon Sumrall. Kentucky issued an offer on Sunday, while Florida State, North Carolina, Iowa, Virginia Tech, Duke and Miami led the offer avalanche last week.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 200-pounder won the accuracy challenge at the Elite 11 Regional. Invites to the Elite 11 Finals won’t sent for a while, but there’s reason to believe that he could find himself in Los Angeles this summer.\n\n“It felt good,” Davidson told Rivals’ Marcus Benjamin after the competition. “It was a fun one to compete against the best; I just had to trust my craft and get the job done.”\n\nNC State and Northwestern were the first to offer Davidson. Both got in early, but there’s plenty of competition now. Florida has quickly grabbed some momentum after offering while Davidson was on campus.\n\n“The energy was electric,” Davidson told Rivals’ Chad Simmons about his time in The Swamp. “You could feel it throughout the building.”\n\nDavidson is currently unranked in the 2027 cycle, but that will soon change.\n\nQuarterbacking Cardinal Mooney to a Florida 2A state title, Davidson had a big junior season. He threw for nearly 2,400 yards and 23 touchdowns, completing over 64 percent of his passes. He also rushed for three scores.\n\nThe Cougars went 14-2 and finished as the No. 34 team in the nation and No. 4 team in Florida, according to the Rivals Composite Rankings. Davidson will return as one of the top senior arms in the Sunshine State in 2026.",

Ron DeSantis (R) criticized U.S. monetary policy on Friday, attributing silver’s historic surge past $103 per ounce to fundamental instability in the dollar.\n\n“If the US actually had a stable currency you wouldn’t see silver setting new records,” DeSantis wrote on X, responding to data from Barchart showing silver hit $103 for the first time in history.\n\nAt the time Santos posted, the March 2026 silver futures contract (SIH26) reached $103.405, up 7.3%.\n\nIf the US actually had a stable currency you wouldn't see silver setting new records. https://t.co/sTplzeT4xk\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nThe statement aligns with DeSantis’s broader monetary policy stance.\n\nHe signed legislation in 2025 making gold and silver legal tender in Florida, effective July 1, and exempting both metals from sales tax.\n\nEarlier, billionaire hedge fund manager Kenneth Griffin expressed concerns about a surge in precious metals and about investors seeking ways to ‘effectively de-dollarize or derisk their portfolios vis-a-vis US sovereign risk,’ while gold advocate Peter Schiff said the dollar's decline would continue, with precious metals potentially reaching $5,000 to $10,000 per ounce.\n\nSee Also: Bezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\n\nOn Friday, March 2026 silver futures closed at $101.33, up 5.15% on the day and 9.73% over the past five days, with a 52-week range of $29.62 to $103.53.\n\nOn Friday, precious metals ETFs saw significant gains, with SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) up 1.37%, US Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (NYSE:GOAU) up 1.82%, and abrdn Physical Silver Shares ETF (NYSE:SIVR) up 6.64%.\n\nBlue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\nWall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

    "description": "As Golfweek celebrates its 50th anniversary, we honor the journey from Charley Stine’s garage in Winter Haven, Florida, to becoming a global voice in golf.",
    "fullText": "I’ve often told my non-golfing friends that one of life’s greatest teases is spending an hour or two along 17-Mile Drive — that breathtaking stretch of road winding through the Monterey Peninsula. It brushes past legendary courses like Pebble Beach Golf Links, Cypress Point, Spyglass Hill, The Links at Spanish Bay, Monterey Peninsula Country Club, and Poppy Ridge.\n\nFor around 12 bucks, even those indifferent to the game can enjoy a scenic sampler of the region, leaving with a phone full of Instagram-worthy shots of some of the most stunning landscapes imaginable.\n\nBut for those of us who live to walk mist-covered fairways and strategize our way through the world’s finest golf holes, the experience is bittersweet. We leave a piece of ourselves behind, wondering if we’ll ever find the time — or the access — to check off any boxes on this nearly mythical bucket list. The slow cruise is both exhilarating and agonizing. It’s like being offered a taste of hors d'oeuvres at a Michelin-starred restaurant, only to be shown the door just as the main course begins to emerge from the kitchen.\n\nThat was exactly how I felt two decades ago, when my daily concerns revolved around the Buffalo Bills and the Sabres. I was working five nights a week as executive sports editor and lead columnist for a daily newspaper, and two more as a weekend sports anchor on the local ABC affiliate. It was a hectic, uneasy existence, shaped by a city and its struggling franchises — post-Jim Kelly, pre-Josh Allen — when the Bills were barely a blip on the national sports radar.\n\nYet every summer, my personal 17-Mile Drive would resurface. The Porter Cup rolled through town, bringing the world’s top amateur golfers to Niagara Falls Country Club. I’d mingle with rising stars like Rickie Fowler, Dustin Johnson, Jason Kokrak, Colt Knost, Gary Woodland, and more. The event took over Lewiston, N.Y., the small village where I resided. A friend who hosted players built an indoor hitting bay just for Adam Scott. One rain delay gave me unexpected hours with Billy Horschel, who walked me through the finer points of his game. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson had come through just before my time, and Max Homa and Justin Thomas followed after I’d moved on.\n\nIt was a delicious dive into a world I didn’t experience for most of the year, and when the entire circus left town after a post-tournament party in the backyard of a friend, I was always left wondering what it would be like to follow these young stars each week.\n\nBut while the golfers were the main attraction for fans, my eyes each summer turned to Ron Balicki.\n\nBorn to a family in public housing in Connecticut, Balicki spent time in Arkansas, but eventually found his way to Florida at a time when the golf scene was rapidly ramping up, and after a dozen years at the daily newspaper near Destin, he was named Golfweek’s first managing editor in 1983. While others might have used that as a means to focus solely on the pros, Balicki eventually worked his way back into the game’s grassroots, becoming a legendary college and amateur reporter.\n\nWhen Balicki died in 2014, Golfweek’s then managing editor Jeff Babineau (who has also since passed) penned these incredible paragraphs:\n\nBalicki was an ambassador, serving as Golfweek’s introductory calling card and first handshake to promising amateurs and college players. He not only got to know players, but grew close with their families, too, forging lifelong friendships. Phil Mickelson called him from Doral a few weeks ago to thank Ron for his integrity. When amateur Rickie Fowler decided that he was turning pro in 2009, he stopped mid-practice round and made the one call he knew he needed to make, phoning Balicki.\n\nHis span covering the college game dated to the powerhouse teams of Coach Dave Williams at the University of Houston in the 1980s, and he wrote a great deal about the Stanford teams of the mid-90s that included a rising star named Tiger Woods. Every young American champion of the last three decades who has risen through the amateur ranks – from Scott Verplank to Davis Love III to Mickelson to Justin Leonard to Woods to Ryan Moore to Fowler – was anointed somewhere along his early path with a story carrying a Ron Balicki byline. For years, before the Internet rolled around, he’d even keep his own stats and scribble out Golfweek’s weekly college and amateur rankings by hand on tall, yellow legal pads.\n\nRon Balicki’s story is foundational to Golfweek’s existence — not just for what he contributed to the game, but for how he did it. He was revered not for bravado, but for depth of knowledge. His legacy is built on longevity, expertise, and humility — not bombast.\n\nAs Golfweek celebrates its 50th anniversary, we honor the journey from Charley Stine’s garage in Winter Haven, Florida, to becoming a global voice in golf. Originally printed on paper, Golfweek was the lunchpail-toting publication that mirrored Balicki’s ground-up approach — building trust with players and fans alike. As Curtis Strange recently told me, “We read all the golf publications, but we couldn’t wait to get to Golfweek — to see the stats from every amateur event and compare ourselves with other players. We had to have it.”\n\nFive decades later, the spirit of Balicki, Babineau, Stine, and others who shaped this publication lives on. It’s reflected in Cameron Jourdan’s extensive amateur golf coverage, Jason Lusk’s deep dives into courses, David Dusek’s exhaustive equipment testing, and Eamon Lynch’s incisive columns. And while Beth Ann Nichols and Adam Schupak lead our extensive pro tour coverage, Golfweek remains committed to celebrating the entire game — not just when the purses are biggest.\n\nThese relationships endure. I was reminded of that at this year’s Valero Texas Open, when Brian Harman lit up recalling his 2007 Porter Cup win — a record-setting performance that still tops the event's all-time leaderboard. Or when I heard a touching story from the family who housed Horschel during his amateur days near my hometown. Soon after the family patriarch passed away, Horschel won the 2014 FedEx Cup, a moment that changed his career’s trajectory. Yet he found the time to quickly text them a photo of the trophy, adding, “This one’s for your dad.”\n\nGolfweek’s 50th anniversary isn’t just a milestone — it’s a tribute to the relationships, stories, and spirit that have defined the publication for half a century. And it’s a promise that those values will continue to guide us into the next.\n\nTim Schmitt is the managing editor of Golfweek, and has just two of the 17-Mile Drive courses crossed off his list.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Golfweek at 50: Relationships still matter",

    "fullText": "Shannon Gerdauskas thought she was going in for a routine oil change. Instead, the DeLand, Florida resident was left with a repair bill of nearly $20,000.\n\nGerdauskas took her Mercedes to a Take 5 Oil Change location in October, expecting to be in and out quickly. Instead, she says a technician mistakenly drained her transmission fluid rather than her engine oil and let her drive away.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThe trouble started within minutes.\n\n“It was shifting by itself. So, it was like trying to go into reverse and neutral as I’m driving down the road,” she told WFTV’s Action 9 Consumer Investigator (1).\n\nGerdauskas immediately took the car back to the shop, where workers acknowledged the error.\n\nBut what followed was a familiar and often pricey consumer dispute: Who’s responsible when routine maintenance goes wrong?\n\nAccording to Gerdauskas, her dealership later determined the vehicle had been driven with no transmission fluid, which can cause serious internal damage to the car. The estimated cost to replace the transmission and complete all the related work totaled more than $18,000.\n\nTake 5 told Action 9 that it paid for a transmission flush but closed the claim after the dealership said the transmission did not need to be replaced.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerdauskas said she was told the transmission would eventually fail.\n\n“My transmission was not damaged before it entered their shop,” she said, “Just pay for the damage you did.”\n\nIn a statement, the company said that while cases like Gerdauskas’ are rare, they “strive to resolve matters fairly and transparently”. But her case isn’t as unique as it seems.\n\nAction 9 found similar complaints nationwide involving Take 5.\n\nWFTV’s sister station in Charlotte, North Carolina, spoke with Ben Brown in 2025 after a visit to Take 5. He said he pulled over, opened the oil reservoir and smoke was coming out. His car ultimately needed a new engine.\n\nIn Georgia, Robin Porterfield reported a similar experience. She said technicians drained her oil but never refilled it before sending her on her way.",

    "fullText": "The world of football witnessed another curious episode last Thursday (22).\n\nCoach Lúcio Flávio, who had arrived at Goiatuba with hopes of reviving the team in the 2026 Campeonato Goiano, requested to leave the club after leading the squad for just one round (four days of work).\n\nThe 46-year-old coach released a video announcing his departure and stating that he had accepted a new job offer — he was announced at Uberlândia, in Minas Gerais.\n\nA former midfielder who emerged at Paraná in the late 1990s, Lúcio Flávio played for major clubs in Brazilian football, such as Internacional, São Paulo, Coritiba, Atlético-MG, Vitória, and Santos.\n\nHowever, the club with which he is most closely identified is Botafogo, where he played between 2007 and 2008 and then again from 2009 to 2010.\n\nRetired from the pitch since 2017, Lúcio Flávio began his coaching career as an assistant at Paraná the following year.\n\nHe later served as assistant and interim coach at Botafogo between 2020 and 2023. The young coach also had stints at Aparecidense, São Joseense, and Brasiliense before arriving at Goiatuba at the start of the Goianão.\n\nAt Goiatuba, the team’s situation in the 2026 Campeonato Goiano was already difficult before Lúcio Flávio’s arrival.\n\nThe “Azulão do Sul” started the state championship with another coach, Augusto Fassina, who was dismissed after three winless matches.\n\nLúcio Flávio led the team in just one match, and with only one point on the table, the club remains at the bottom of the competition. The team still has four games ahead to try to escape relegation and dream of a spot among the top eight in the state championship.\n\nMeanwhile, Uberlândia is also going through a tough time. Before the coach’s arrival, the “Verdão” had two losses and two draws in four matches, sitting at the bottom of Group A in the Campeonato Mineiro.\n\nIn four games, the team has yet to win, suffered a 5-0 thrashing by Cruzeiro, and faces challenges ahead as they try to climb out of last place in their group in the state championship.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "The Florida Panthers are back on the road again.\n\nAfter a brief stop in South Florida for Monday’s matchup with the San Jose Sharks, the Panthers boarded a plane on Wednesday bound for the great white north.\n\nAssuming they can defrost, Florida will kick off a three-game road trip Thursday when they face the Winnipeg Jets at Canada Life Centre.\n\nHopefully the Cats brought their fur layers, as the temperature on Thursday in Winnipeg has a high of minus-17 and a low of minus-22.\n\nWhen they eventually hit the ice, Florida will be playing against a Jets squad that is desperately trying to bounce back from an atrocious stretch that took up most of November and December.\n\nAfter winning nine of their first 12 games, the Jets went into a tailspin that peaked with an 11-game losing streak that ran from mid-December to early January.\n\nThey went from a strong 9-3-0 start to the season to holding a 15-22-5 mark on Jan. 8 (that’s a 6-19-5 run for those wondering).\n\nSince ending the losing streak, Winnipeg has seemingly turned a corner, going 5-1-1 over the past couple weeks.\n\nThey will face a Florida squad that is also trying to make up ground and viewing every potential point in the standings as crucial.\n\nIt helps that the Panthers are getting healthier, welcoming Matthew Tkachuk into the lineup for the first time on Monday against San Jose.\n\nWith Tkachuk back in the fold, it’s just a matter of time before Florida’s forward ranks become as potent as they’ve been all season, which will happen when Brad Marchand is cleared to return.\n\n“He’s certainly close, day-to-day,” Maurice said of Marchand, who has missed six straight games with an undisclosed injury. “Whether it happens on this road trip, I don’t know yet. We are just kind of building off how he comes in each day. He felt better today than he maybe expected to (after) he got through practice. So we’ll need him to wake up tomorrow at least, and then probably the next day, before we start feeling that he’s right there.”\n\nFor Maruice, any time Florida returns to Winnipeg, it’s a special night for him.\n\nMaurice spent nine seasons coaching the Jets, leading them to the playoffs five times.\n\n“I do look forward to it,” Maurice said of returning to Winnipeg. “There’s great memories in that place, so it’s a fun trip.”\n\nSince joining the Panthers in 2022, Maurice has yet to see Florida pick up a victory in his old stomping grounds, going 0-3-0 in Winnipeg by a combined score of 14-5.\n\n“I don’t know if we’ve ever won in there,” Maurice said with a smile. “Other than the final scores, it’s been good.”\n\nHere are the Panthers projected lines and pairings for Thursday’s tussle in Winnipeg:\n\nEetu Luostarinen – Anton Lundell – Sam Reinhart\n\nCarter Verhaeghe – Sam Bennett – Matthew Tkachuk\n\nMackie Samoskevich – Evan Rodrigues – A.J.

Although the match was 90 minutes, starters played for only about half an hour, with backups and players from Huntsville City FC getting the rest of the action.\n\n\"For us, it's more about setting clear objectives of what we worked on this week,\" Callaghan said. \"Being clear with how we're going to evaluate in the game, which would be on certain objectives, a couple phases of play that we were focused on.\"\n\nHere are additional takeaways from the game against the Fire, as well as Nashville's first week of the preseason.\n\nNashville SC arrived in Florida on Jan. 12 and will play four of its six preseason matches there, with the next against the Colorado Rapids on Jan. 23. The team will practice in Nashville for a week ahead of an exhibition at USL club Birmingham Legion on Jan. 31, go back to Florida for two more games and finally face Lexington SC in Nashville on Feb. 14, two days before its CONCACAF Champions Cup opening match at Atletico Ottawa.\n\nNashville dealt with several injuries in its past two preseason training camps, but Callaghan said the team is almost fully healthy, with only one player, Huntsville forward Alioune Ka, sitting out against the Fire.\n\nThat doesn't mean Nashville would be ready to play a competitive game tomorrow.\n\n\"The fitness component is getting there,\" Callaghan said. \"It's growing in the right direction, but we're not where we need to be. We're not 90-minute fit for sure. But it's intentional, and we're gonna build through this preseason.\"\n\nNashville's first MLS game is Feb. 21 against the New England Revolution at Geodis Park (7:30 p.m. CT).\n\nMORE: Nashville SC signals MLS championship aspirations with Cristian Espinoza\n\nNashville's starting lineup looked like a full-strength group. Brian Schwake started at goalkeeper, while new signing Maxwell Woledzi paired with Jeisson Palacios at center back. Dan Lovitz and Andy Najar started at left and right back, respectively.\n\nEdvard Tagseth and Patrick Yazbek held down central midfield, with Alex Muyl and Cristian Espinoza playing on the wings and Hany Mukhtar and Sam Surridge up front in attack.\n\nCallaghan said Nashville started out in the 4-2-2-2 formation, which was its primary setup in 2025. While that remained the base throughout the 90 minutes, Nashville tweaked that shape at different moments.\n\nEspinoza, the club's newest designated player, worked for the first time with the other two DPs, Mukhtar and Surridge. The trio didn't produce any goals, but created a few opportunities, according to Callaghan.\n\n\"They bring different dynamics, whether it's playing between the lines, running behind, being able to get service,\" Callaghan said. \"It's about creating that connection, that chemistry between those three. But at the same time, it's also making sure that we're well dialed-in on the defensive side.\"\n\nMidfielder Charles-Emile Brunet scored Nashville's lone goal on a long shot during the third and final shift, which consisted largely of trialists and draft picks. Brunet was Nashville's third-round pick in December's MLS SuperDraft out of SMU.\n\nJacob Shames can be reached by email at jshames@gannett.com and on X/Twitter @Jacob_Shames.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nashville Tennessean: Nashville SC MLS preseason takeaways, what we learned",

    "description": "Celebrities are flocking to Florida. Here's why everyone from David Beckham to Sylvester Stallone has moved to the Sunshine State.",
    "fullText": "Florida has always been an appealing destination for movers, thanks to its lack of income tax and great weather. Celebrities have often found their way there for vacations or second homes, but in recent years, more high-end buyers are putting down more serious roots in the Sunshine State.\n\nSuperstar athlete Lionel Messi, for instance, made his way to Florida after leaving Barcelona. Actors like Sylvester Stallone, one of the many Hollywood stars who've left California, also opted to make Florida his new home base.\n\nAnd while international celebrity moves aren't all that surprising, there's also been a new crop of mover: ultrawealthy business and tech icons.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Miami tried to establish itself as the third coast for tech behind San Francisco and New York, and the city was able to lure some large players, from startup founders to investment firm CEOs.\n\nThe realignment of wealth has made some regions more popular than they were previously, but Florida, especially, has emerged as a great place to call home for the wealthy.\n\nBusiness Insider rounded up 15 celebrities and business leaders who have left various parts of the country to establish themselves — and, in some cases, their businesses — in sunny Florida, presented in alphabetical order by last name.\n\nThe \"Happy Days\" and \"Charles in Charge\" actor posted on X in May 2023 that he was leaving California after 45 years, citing the homeless issue in LA County.\n\n\"Florida is pretty much what America was like 50 years ago,\" Baio told Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo weeks after the post. \"It's just people hanging out. Everything's wide open, it's free, the people that I meet are all just nice.\"\n\nRetired soccer great David Beckham is spending more time in Miami these days.\n\nHe and his wife, Victoria Beckham, bought a $24 million, five-bedroom condo in 2020 that features a swimming pool and rooftop helipad. The couple moved to Miami after Beckham became co-owner and president of the Major League Soccer team Inter Miami CF.\n\n\"Miami is the gateway to the Americas, embracing people from all over the world, and Inter Miami CF was built to bring world-class football to this world-class city,\" Beckham wrote on his website of his interest in owning Inter Miami.\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos bought a $68 million mansion in Biscayne Bay in August 2023. Two months later, he bought a seven-bedroom house next door for $79 million. In April, he bought another property in Florida — this time for $90 million.\n\nBezos said he was leaving Seattle, where his company is headquartered, for Miami to be closer to his parents and to the operations of the aerospace company he also founded, Blue Origin.\n\n\"I've lived in Seattle longer than I've lived anywhere else and have so many amazing memories here,\" Bezos said in an Instagram post. \"As exciting as the move is, it's an emotional decision for me.\"\n\nAfter signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020, and winning a Super Bowl with the team before he retired from the NFL in 2023, Brady has stayed put in Florida.\n\nFirst, he was living in a 1.2-acre mansion during his time as a Buccaneer while married to Gisele Bündchen (it was once owned by Derek Jeter).\n\nSince his divorce, he's moved to Miami. The bachelor pad features floor-to-ceiling windows and an indoor/outdoor living space with a fireplace and pool, according to snapshots he's shared on Instagram.\n\n\"I was a native Californian for a long time in my life, went away from it for about 25 years, and you won't catch me dead living in the Northeast anymore,\" Brady said in 2020, referencing his time as a New England Patriot. \"I'm loving the warm weather, and it's been a great feeling.\"\n\nThe king of \"Flavortown\" has spent most of his career on the West Coast, having gone to college in Las Vegas and building his restaurant empire in California. Now, as one of the major food personalities in the world and with his children growing up, he's thinking of the next chapter in his life.\n\nFieri bought a waterfront home near West Palm Beach in 2023 for $7.3 million, according to The Palm Beach Post.\n\nThe estate has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, 6,621 square feet of indoor living space, and a 5-foot infinity pool. Its 230-foot frontage on the Intracostal Waterway has enough room to dock a 100-foot yacht.\n\n\"Even a cloudy day in Florida is an awesome day,\" he said while opening up one of his Chicken Guy chains in Winter Park, Florida in 2023. \"I will be in Florida way more than you know.\"\n\nKen Griffin founded the investment firm Citadel in 1990 in Chicago but has since ditched the Windy City for the warmer climate of Miami.\n\nGriffin not only moved his firm — which has about $58 billion in assets managed — to Florida, he moved himself. He plans on building a $1 billion office for the new Citadel headquarters and isn't skimping on his own digs either.\n\nIn 2022, Griffin bought a waterfront property for more than $106 million, breaking the previous record (which he set himself the year before, after buying a home on Star Island for $75 million).\n\nJosh Kushner, venture capitalist and brother to Jared Kushner, left Manhattan for a $23.5 million property in Miami Beach in 2020.\n\nKushner and his wife, model Karlie Kloss, moved into an eight-bedroom, 14,000-square-foot mansion on a waterfront lot.\n\nAccording to Architectural Digest, Kushner and Kloss bought another property in Manhattan in 2021, but property records show they still own their home in Miami Beach.\n\nThree years after taking the team, David Beckham acquired arguably the world's greatest soccer player.\n\nLionel Messi signed on to play for Inter Miami CF in 2023, and when he's not on the pitch, he enjoys his $10.75 million waterfront mansion in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe 10,500-square-foot two-story house has 10 bedrooms, nine bathrooms, two docks, and 170 feet of water frontage, according to the Miami Herald.\n\n\"It has been very easy, very easy,\" Messi said at a 2023 press conference about adapting to his new surroundings in Miami. \"We were convinced we wanted to come here, and the people made it very easy, the people in the club and the people I see day to day in the streets and the amazing city, it makes living here very easy and happy.\"\n\nIn 2021, WeWork cofounder Adam Neumann sold his Bay Area compound for $22.4 million and bought two properties in Miami.\n\nNeumann bought two adjacent properties totaling 50,000 square feet for $44 million. The waterfront properties are located in an exclusive part of Miami Beach.\n\nCome November 2026, Californians will vote to impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth in California. Google cofounder Larry Page wasn't going to chance it, and reportedly bought two properties in Miami's Coconut Grove neighborhood.\n\nThe proposed bill would retroactively tax billionaires living in California as of January 1. Page, whose net worth is $269 billion, purchased his first Florida property in December 2025.\n\nPage's two properties are worth upward of $170 million and are less than a mile apart. He also moved his businesses out of the Golden State.\n\nBillionaire and hedge-fund manager Larry Robbins is leaving New York City, but he's not bringing his company with him.\n\nRobbins, the CEO of Glenview Capital Management, bought a home in Palm Beach Gardens for $13.9 million earlier in 2024, according to The Real Deal.\n\nUnlike other bosses who are moving their operations with them, Bloomberg reported that Robbins will keep the fund in New York while he commutes back and forth.\n\nJudge Judy Sheindlin has been enjoying the Sunshine State for some time. For years, she and her husband have lived in Naples.\n\nAt one time, they owned an 8,550-square-foot condo with two private elevators and a sauna but put it on the market in 2015.\n\nShe then moved into a 10,000-square-foot mansion about a mile away that overlooks a man-made lake.\n\nIn 2022, a month after the devastation of Hurricane Ian through Florida, Sheindlin told \"Good Morning America\" that she lost a couple of cars due to the storm, but that wouldn't stop her from going back to Florida.\n\n\"We kissed goodbye a couple of cars, which went floating,\" she said. \"But, generally speaking, we were luckier than most people down in Florida. And we're hoping to get back before the season ends.\"\n\nAfter decades of living in Los Angeles, the iconic actor packed up for Florida in 2023.\n\nThe move was revealed in early 2024, when season two of his reality series, \"The Family Stallone,\" aired.\n\n\"After a long, hard consideration, your mother and I have decided, time to move on and leave the state of California permanently, and we're going to go to Florida,\" Stallone told his kids. \"We're going to sell this house.\"\n\nStallone and his wife, Jennifer Flavin, gave multiple reasons for the relocation, including the desire for a fresh start after their children moved out of the family home.\n\nThe legendary shock jock spent decades living it up in the Hamptons, and now he's doing the same in Florida.\n\nStern bought the massive 20,000-square-foot oceanfront property in Palm Beach in 2013 for a reported $52 million.\n\nThe property is so desirable that in April, rumors spread that Jeff Bezos bought Stern's estate for $300 million. However, Page Six later reported that the rumors were false and that Stern even told the billionaire his place wasn't for sale.\n\n\"New York is the center of the world,\" Stern once told listeners of his show in 2015. \"Why wouldn't everyone just move to Florida and build a New York there? I don't get it.\"\n\nFormer president Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, reportedly spent $30 million in December 2020 on a waterfront lot on Indian Creek Island — a gated community home to a handful of celebrities.\n\nWhen they bought the property, the home was billed as a \"fixer-upper,\" and they spent years on renovations.\n\nAfter leaving Washington, DC, but before moving into their new home, the couple rented a condo tower, Arte Tower, in Surfside, Florida, about a mile from their property.",

    "description": "Speaking to PEOPLE a few months later, the man acknowledged, 'I shouldn't have been there'",
    "fullText": "An 80-year old man survived 18 hours at sea after his boat drifted while he was spearfishing\n\nIgnacio Siberio told PEOPLE in a 2005 interview that the experience was \"terrible\"\n\n\"I realized the only way I was going to make it... was with my mind,\" he said shortly after his rescue\n\nIgnacio Siberio was 80 years old when he sailed his 25-foot boat about seven miles off the Florida Keys to go spearfishing. It was Dec. 11, 2005 and Siberio was a practicing civil attorney and a skilled spearfisher who often went in the water with his nephew.\n\nWhen his nephew couldn't make it that day, he opted to go alone, even as gusty winds and choppy water threatened to derail the experience.\n\nSpeaking to PEOPLE a few months later, Siberio acknowledged, \"I shouldn't have been there.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nSiberio dove into the ocean with his speargun, hunting for three hours before deciding to head home. When he surfaced, his boat was gone — a casualty of a storm front that had dislodged its anchors.\n\nSiberio could see the boat in the distance — attempting to swim after it for several hours — but could not quite catch up.\n\n\"It was terrible,\" he told PEOPLE.\n\nAt that point, exhausted, Siberio began treading water, worrying that he would \"be swept into the Straits of Florida,\" he said.\n\nOne hour of treading water later, though, he spotted five one-foot-long buoys floating together — swimming to them and holding on as tight as he could. As the temperatures dropped overnight, he tried to relax, telling PEOPLE later: \"I realized the only way I was going to make it... was with my mind.\"\n\nUnbeknownst to Siberio, his nephew and a friend had already begun a frantic search, enlisting the Coast Guard to boat to his favorite fishing spots.\n\nEarly the morning after he first got separated from his boat, they found him: Siberio had cut the buoys and wrapped them around himself. He was swimming towards the shore.\n\nSiberio was pulled into the rescue vessel about 18 hours after he first realized he was lost at sea. He was then brought him to his Tavernier, Fla., home (he refused a hospital visit), and greeted by loved ones led by his wife, Gloria, then 68.\n\nAs PEOPLE reported at the time, the incident did little to quell his love for fishing, and he had already been several times in the months immediately after.\n\n\"My lesson is you have to be careful,\" he told PEOPLE. \"Fortunately I was able to bring happiness instead of sadness by coming home.\"\n\nSpeaking to CBC radio following his rescue, Siberio noted that fate seemed to be on his side.\n\n\"The buoy that I got hold of to stay all night had my date of birth,\" he told the outlet. \"I was born in July 31st, and the buoy had the number 731. Can you imagine that?\"",

    "description": "ACA subsidies expiring leaves 1.4 million fewer insured compared to 2025, as CMS data shows enrollment declines in Florida and other Southern states.",
    "fullText": "The disappearance of Affordable Care Act subsidies has millions of households feeling health insurance sticker shock.\n\nA report published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid found that there are 1.4 million fewer people enrolled in insurance through ACA marketplaces this month compared to January 2025. States like Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and Georgia saw the most significant dips.\n\n\"People have less access to care, and that tends to translate into worse health outcomes,\" said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution. He added that many households' financial security is at risk: \"People will face big bills that they either can't pay, and that hurts their credit. Or they do pay, but it requires them to skimp in other areas.\"\n\nBusiness Insider broke down the enrollment changes by state — and spoke with experts about why this CMS data doesn't yet tell the whole story of marketplace enrollment in 2026.\n\nThe number of marketplace enrollees declined most significantly in the South and Southeast, though the majority of states reported a downswing. Florida saw enrollment dive by more than 260,000 people. Registration in a few states, like Texas and California, increased.\n\nPeople might opt for a marketplace plan if their employer doesn't offer coverage, if they're self-employed, if they lose their job, or if their income is too high to qualify for Medicaid. In context, the 1.4 million dip this year is notable: Marketplace enrollment had jumped from 11 to over 24 million between 2015 and 2025.\n\nThe enhanced ACA subsidies — which were passed in 2021 and expired on December 31 — made health insurance more affordable for lower- and middle-income Americans. They allowed people with incomes up to 400% of the poverty line (which is $128,600 annually for a family of four) to claim relief on healthcare costs.\n\nA KFF estimate found that, without these credits in place, Americans in the marketplace could see their out-of-pocket premium costs more than double compared to last year.\n\nWhite House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that \"ACA enrollment declined by 3.5 percent between 2025 and 2026 — entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans.\"\n\nEfforts to renew these credits were a point of contention between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, contributing to the latest government shutdown. Lawmakers opted not to renew the subsidies in December, and the latest ACA vote is stalled in the Senate until late January.\n\nRepublicans have said they aim to reach a compromise healthcare strategy, but a plan President Donald Trump released on January 15 does not mention subsidies. The plan lays out the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums, implement cost-sharing programs, and increase cost transparency.\n\n\"The basic contour of the plan is contradictory,\" said Gideon Lukens, senior fellow and director of research and data analysis at the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. \"Much less the question of how this would work, who would get what, and why this is better than directly covering people's premiums to prevent the spikes millions of people are facing right now.\"\n\nPolicy analysts told Business Insider they expect a steeper decline in ACA enrollment over the next few months. The January report is a snapshot of the marketplace landscape, but comes with caveats.\n\nThe latest data shows how many Americans selected a marketplace plan during open enrollment or were automatically renewed for their existing ACA coverage. It doesn't capture how many people have paid their health insurance premiums, meaning that more people are likely to drop coverage once they start receiving bills. A recent Congressional Budget Office report estimates that nearly 4 million Americans will lose or drop insurance over the next decade.\n\n\"Many likely signed up when the premiums they would end up facing were uncertain and then waited to see what they would have to pay,\" said Matthew Buettgens, a senior fellow at The Urban Institute.\n\nFor the few states where enrollment spiked, Fielder theorized that local healthcare policy is a factor. California offers its own ACA subsidies, for example, so residents are less vulnerable to the federal changes.\n\nBesides the direct impact on patients, Fielder also said the lapse of ACA credits could put more pressure on hospitals, because providers could see an influx of uninsured patients, and people would be less likely to seek care in the first place.\n\n\"There will be facilities that were already financially fragile for whom this is the straw that breaks the camel's back,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page recently drew his line in the sand on a beach on the opposite side of California — and it cost him over $170 million.\n\nCalifornia has proposed the Billionaire Tax Act, which would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth over $1 billion. Page, whose net worth is $269 billion as of January according to Forbes, isn't giving California the option to tax him and is deserting the Golden State for a state on the opposite extreme of taxing the wealthy: Florida.\n\nThe proposed bill, which doesn't appear on the ballot until November, would retroactively tax billionaires living in California as of January 1. Conveniently, Page reportedly located a Florida residence just before then.\n\nPage purchased a 4.5-acre compound in Miami's glamorous Coconut Grove neighborhood in December 2025 for $101.5 million, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Miami-Dade County property records show late restaurateur Jonathan Lewis previously owned the property.\n\nAnd for good measure, property records show a trust linked to Page bought another property — less than a mile away from the other — for $71.9 million in January this year. The trust, Tropical Frontier Revocable Trust, lists Florida attorney Benjamin Babcock and Mary McFadden Quisenberry, the chief operating officer of Palo Alto, California-based Rosewood Family Advisors, as trustees. Babcock declined to comment on the transaction.\n\nTax filings from Page's family foundation, the Carl Victor Page Memorial Foundation, show Rosewood Family Advisors provided tax and accounting services for the foundation in 2024. Rosewood Family Advisors could not be reached for comment.\n\nPage also filed to move a number of his businesses from California to Delaware, Florida, and Texas, Business Insider reported earlier this year.\n\nAn agent involved in the $101.5-million transaction, Danny Hertzberg of The Jills Zeder Group, declined to comment on this particular deal. He said wealthy Californians have been lining up to buy homes in Florida recently.\n\n\"We started feeling an impact, let's say in early December, which really picked up going to the end of the year,\" Hertzberg told Business Insider. \"California's dominating the high end of the market. The market right now, in terms of offers and active buyers, has a huge California presence, and it's directly related to 5% net worth.\"\n\nWealthy people moving to South Florida isn't a new trend, though some of the most recent residents made large splashes. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, arguably, became the most notable Florida mover after building his own compound on an exclusive island in Miami's Biscayne Bay.\n\nSouth Florida tried a somewhat rebrand in the early 2020s as the Silicon Valley of the East and did attract some movers. This latest shift has serious legs and the potential to change the perception of South Florida, according to Hertzberg.\n\n\"All of the movement I've seen from California is primary residences — people putting roots down and planning to be here,\" Hertzberg said. \"I think that may push along an already strong existing trend as Miami emerges as a major destination for finance and tech.\"\n\n\"With the level and caliber of people that are looking, that have already acquired properties here, and that are moving here, I do think, on the overall business perspective of Miami, it's already one of the major players in the country, if not the world,\" Hertzberg added. \"And it's going to be elevated as one of the premier destinations for those industries of finance, tech, and everything related.\"",

    "description": "Florida-based Sailormen has struggled with debt stemming from several lawsuits, among other challenges",
    "fullText": "You can find original article here Nrn. \n\nSailormen Inc., a Miami-based Popeyes franchisee with more than 130 restaurants in its portfolio, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Southern District of Florida.&nbsp;\n\nIn its filing, the company estimated it had about $130 million in debt. The company said it has “faced significant challenges” throughout the past year leading to its financial struggles, including rising operational costs due to inflation and increased borrowing expenses, higher wages, and consumer behavior changes since the pandemic that drove lower traffic.\n\nAdditionally, in late 2023, Sailormen entered into an agreement with a buyer, Tar Heels Spice, to sell 16 of its Georgia restaurants as part of a restructuring plan. That deal fell through, however, further straining the company’s finances. Sailormen stopped covering rent for the locations in April 2024 and then filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Tar Heels Spice in August 2024.&nbsp;\n\nFurther, the company’s primary lender, BMO Bank, filed a lawsuit in December for breach of contract against Sailormen related to the franchisee’s loan obligations. In that complaint, BMO is seeking a court-appointed receiver to take control of Sailormen and its assets, which was the catalyst for the Chapter 11 filing. Sailormen said its stakeholders “will fare better” because of the filing.\n\nSailormen ended 2025 with more than $233 million in sales and a net operating loss of nearly $19 million.&nbsp;\n\nThis filing comes on the heels of a relatively soft year for the chain, including -2% same-store sales in the most recently reported third quarter. Those results followed a 0.9% decline in same-store sales in Q2, and -4% in Q1.&nbsp;In 2024, however, Popeyes sales were up nearly 4%, while the company has increased its sales by nearly 20% since 2021.&nbsp;\n\nSeveral concepts have filed bankruptcy already, less than a month into 2026, illustrating a market rife with challenges such as higher cost inputs and slower consumer usage. Over the past six weeks, concepts including Pieology Pizza, Taste of Belgium, Ray Ray’s Hog Pit, and Compass Coffee have all filed for protection.&nbsp;\n\nContact Alicia Kelso at Alicia.Kelso@informa.com\n\nFollow her on TikTok: @aliciakelso",

    "description": "For the first time in the 12-year history of the CFP, both starting QBs in the title game hail from Florida high schools. But it’s not just the quarterbacks.",
    "fullText": "For the first time in the 12-year history of the CFP, both starting QBs in the title game hail from Florida high schools. But it’s not just the quarterbacks. What’s even more intriguing is that 58 players in the National Championship were born in Florida, which is a blueprint that the new head coach, Jon Sumrall, cannot ignore.\n\n“Florida breeds football,” wrote Hard Rock Bet, Florida’s only legal sports book, sharing a collage of all Florida-born players on Thursday.\n\nBoth star performers, Fernando Mendoza and Carson Beck, hail from Florida but from different cities. This signals that coach Sumrall needs to focus on recruiting local talent to build a title-winning roster for the Gators. This past season, Florida endured a rough 4–8 campaign, prompting the hiring of Jon Sumrall to get the program back on track.\n\nPrograms dominating with homegrown talent justify the importance of retaining local players. In fact, Georgia, under Kirby Smart, did the same thing in 2024-25. They kept most of their roster from Georgia high schools, which paid off with back-to-back titles and a 2025 playoff run.\n\nWhile Jon Sumrall has already added proven talent. The Gators have secured commitments from Auburn WR Eric Singleton Jr., PSU OT Eagan Boyer, and OL T.J. Shanahan Jr., UCF LB TJ Bullard, Georgia Tech OL Harrison Moore and QB Aaron Philo, and more. Meanwhile, the program has also lost nearly 20 players to the transfer portal, including star QB DJ Lagway.\n\nFilling gaps is now essential. But Sumrall’s 2026 roster shows a chance to return the Gators to the glory days of 2008, when they defeated Oklahoma to win the BCS National Championship.\n\nThe 2026 roster features plenty of Florida-born talent, including Bryce Lovett, Dallas Wilson, Jamari Lyons, TJ Abrams, Cormani McClain, and more. While this year’s national championship clearly shows Florida players have football in their blood, the 2026 roster only needs Sumrall’s guidance to turn that talent into execution.\n\nNow, while Sumrall prioritizes retention and has proven his ability to develop talent at its best, something he already showed at Tulane, it’s time for the Gators to step into the spotlight under his leadership. The HC has already hit the ground running at Florida, making roster retention his top priority. That’s probably why key players, like running back Jadan Baugh, quickly re-signed after meeting with him.\n\n“Future Gators matter, sure, but current Gators matter more,” he said.\n\nWhile his mantra is simple: production over pedigree, at Troy and Tulane, he turned unranked and two-star recruits into NFL-ready talent. Now, Florida hopes he can work the same magic in Gainesville. While both teams boast Florida-born talent, which has the better chance to win? Oddsmakers favor Indiana to take the national championship, yet the Miami Nation hasn’t given up hope.\n\nThe Hurricanes are gearing up to face the Hoosiers for the National Championship on January 19, and the excitement is electric. Here, fans and alumni are buzzing, drawing comparisons to past glory days.\n\nRoderick Carter, a former LB and 1987 national champion, sees echoes of his team in this year’s squad.\n\n“It brings me back to the glory days. Brings me back to where we were competing at a high level,” said Carter.\n\nNow a behavior coach and case manager in Palm Beach County, Carter isn’t worried about the doubters.\n\n“I know there’s a lot of analysis and experts thinking Miami is going to come up short. I just think that we have what it takes, you know, to be victorious come Monday night,” he added.\n\nJust like that, the sentiment is clear: this team has talent and the hunger to win. But on the flip side, fans are riding the wave of momentum from the Fiesta Bowl, where Miami defeated Ole Miss in style.\n\n“I think our defense has been really great this year. Our defense and our offense—we have some really talented players; Malachi Toney has been killing it. Shout out to him. He’s amazing,” said Canes fan Daniela Battisti.\n\nWith the last national title in 2001, many current supporters weren’t even born then, but the spirit of the ‘U’ is alive and roaring.\n\nThe post 2026 National Championship Spotlight Offers a Lesson Jon Sumrall Can’t Afford to Ignore as Gators HC appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Authorities in central Florida have arrested a young couple, charging them with neglect after their newborn twin babies had to be hospitalized.\n\nMadison Smith, 23 and Leroy Somersall III, 24, live in Sanford, Florida, where police have charged them with child neglect with great bodily harm.\n\nPolice said the twin babies — a boy and a girl, born five months ago — were taken to the hospital on January 6 after one was found unresponsive. While there, medical staff quickly realized the twins were severely in a malnourished state and extremely dehydrated.\n\nHospital officials called police and told them the infants' bones were showing, and that their abdomens had sunken in, according to arrest documents obtained by Us Weekly. The brother and sister, whose names were redacted in court records, weighed only 5.7 pounds at the time of their hospital admission.\n\nThe baby boy actually weighed more when he was discharged from the hospital after his birth, it is alleged in the arrest report.\n\nBoth babies were \"thin and frail\" in appearance, and had low blood sugar levels, according to the arrest reports. Nurses also told police the babies seemed \"very sick, underfed, and malnourished.\"\n\nThe arrest report notes the twins were born a month prematurely, and that Smith had tested positive for THC while the babies were in utero.\n\nParents Busted in South Carolina After 5-Month-Old Dies in Suspected Child Abuse Case\n\n\"There are concerns that the children are not being fed properly,\" read the arrest report, which noted the couple have a \"history\" of complaints lodged against them with the department of Children and Families.\n\nThe reports claim Child Protective Services received a tip about possible abuse of the twins.\n\nSpeaking to police at the hospital, the couple allegedly claimed they were not advised by health care professionals about the need to feed babies more as they develop and acknowledged that they provided the twins with minimal amounts of formula, because they were newly born.\n\nBut during a search of the couple's RV, police allegedly found no formula on hand. Also missing from the RV and the trash can were empty containers of formula, police alleged.\n\nThe police report alleges the two babies started gaining weight between January 6 and Sunday, January 11, as the hospital staff had been feeding them regularly.\n\n\"Hospital staff have expressed that both children are expected to survive,\" according to the arrest reports, which claim one of the two children is suffering from an unspecified neurological condition.\n\nThe couple was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday, January 13. It was unclear what the outcome of that initial hearing was. Us Weekly was trying to confirm if the couple had entered pleas or were represented by counsel.\n\nIf you suspect child abuse, please call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child or 1-800-422-4453, or visit ChildHelp.org.

    "description": "Nicknamed \"Venice of America,\" Florida's Fort Lauderdale isn't quite a dupe for the Italian city, but there are great things to do if you visit.",
    "fullText": "I've lived in Miami for nearly a decade, and one of my favorite things to do is travel around Florida.\n\nOne of my go-to spots is Fort Lauderdale, a refreshing city right on the Atlantic Ocean located about 30 miles north of Miami.\n\nWith a population of about 200,000 residents, this eastern Florida city is known for its quieter beaches, walkable downtown, and vibrant stores and restaurants.\n\nIt's also famous for having hundreds of miles of canals that curl in and around the city — a feature that's earned it the nickname \"Venice of America.\" Just like in Italy's Venice, these winding waterways are very much a part of daily life in this Florida city.\n\nHowever, if your mind is now swimming with images of Italy's lagoon-encased city filled with gondolas, keep reading before you book your trip to Fort Lauderdale.\n\nIf you plan on visiting Fort Lauderdale and want to indulge in the city's Venetian spirit, I've got suggestions for popular things you can do in the city.\n\nFor one, you'll want to head downtown and make Las Olas your home base. Las Olas Boulevard is a pedestrian-friendly roadway that runs parallel to the New River, which sits a few blocks south.\n\nIt stretches all the way to the beaches, but the part closer to the US-1 highway in the west is where you'll find the most popular stores and restaurants — many of which tout their water views to guests and offer lots of outdoor seating.\n\nHere, you can set out on foot to shop along the tree-lined boulevard, grab brunch at the French-inspired Café Bastille Fort Lauderdale, or visit the Historic Stranahan House Museum by the water.\n\nThough downtown Fort Lauderdale is definitely walkable — especially compared to other parts of South Florida — you don't have to set out on foot if you don't want to.\n\nLike the vaporetto in Venice, the area offers water taxis that you can pay to ride, but I suggest the LauderGO! Water Trolley, which is free.\n\nThe trolley transports visitors along the New River in Downtown Fort Lauderdale, allowing them to travel seamlessly from one popular spot to the next.\n\nIt runs from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., traveling in a loop and stopping at popular locations along the north and south sides of the river, including Riverfront Plaza, Esplanade Park, and Tarpon River.\n\nWhen I visited Venice, one of my favorite things to do was walk along the canals early in the morning or right before dusk. The gentle lapping of the water was calming, and the views were as beautiful as what I'd seen in pictures online.\n\nIn Fort Lauderdale, you can get that same feeling by wandering along the Riverwalk, a passageway that, as the name suggests, follows the curve and flow of the New River.\n\nI enjoy walking here in the morning with a coffee in hand, unhurried, as I take in the beautiful nature of South Florida.\n\nThe city is definitely worth a visit in its own right, but picturing an Italian-style city plopped down along Florida's southeastern coast will only set you up for disappointment — and you'll miss out on all the incredible things Fort Lauderdale has to offer.\n\nAlthough the vibes in these two cities are completely different, both have some beautiful canals that are integral to the local community.\n\nFort Lauderdale is no dupe for Italy, but it's a wonderful pick if you're looking to enjoy some waterside dining and sunshine.",

    "fullText": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of killing a traveling salesman during a robbery is set to become Florida's first execution of 2026 under a death warrant signed Friday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who signed off on a record 19 executions last year.\n\nRonald Palmer Heath, 64, is scheduled to die by lethal injection Feb. 10 at Florida State Prison. DeSantis oversaw more executions in a single year in 2025 than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The previous record was set in 2014 with eight executions.\n\nHeath was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery with a death weapon and multiple forgery charges in 1990.\n\nAccording to court records, Heath and his brother, Kenneth Heath, met traveling salesman Michael Sheridan at a Gainesville bar in May 1989. After hanging out at the bar for some time, the three men agreed to go somewhere else to smoke marijuana.\n\nAt some point, the brothers plotted to rob the other man, investigators said. Ronald Heath drove the group to a remote area, where Kenneth Heath pulled a handgun on Sheridan. The man initially refused to give the brothers anything, and Kenneth Heath shot Sheridan in the chest.\n\nAs Sheridan emptied his pockets, Ronald Heath began kicking the man and stabbing him with a hunting knife, prosecutors said. Kenneth Heath then shot Sheridan twice in the head.\n\nThe brothers dumped Sheridan's body in a wooded area and returned to the Gainesville bar to take items from his rental car. The brothers made multiple purchases with Sheridan's credit cards the next day at a Gainesville mall.\n\nRonald Heath was arrested several weeks later at his Douglas, Georgia, home after investigators connected him to the stolen credit cards. Officers recovered clothing purchased with the stolen cards, as well as Sheridan's watch, according to court records.\n\nKenneth Heath was also charged with Sheridan's murder, but he was sentenced to life in prison as part of a plea agreement.\n\nAttorneys for Ronald Heath are expected to file appeals to the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nA total of 47 people were executed in the U.S. in 2025. Florida led the way with a flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis. The state's final execution of 2025 was the Dec. 18 lethal injection of Frank Athen Walls, who was convicted of fatally shooting a man and his girlfriend during a home invasion robbery.",

The spacecraft system’s four-mile journey from the assembly building to Launch Pad 39B will take up to 12 hours. NASA is targeting a date no earlier than January 17, with the exact day depending on the weather and on the possible need for additional time to address technical issues.Artemis 2 is the first crewed mission to the moon since the Apollo program’s final flight in 1972. The 10-day mission will have four astronauts on board who’ll be testing if Orion’s critical life support systems can sustain human passengers on future longer duration missions. They will first orbit the Earth twice before making their way 4,700 miles beyond the far side of the moon. If the SLS and Orion system is rolled out as planned, NASA intends to conduct a wet dress rehearsal at the end of January. The agency will load cryogenic propellants into the rocket and will do a full launch countdown during the rehearsal to prepare for the real event.",

    "fullText": "The post Crocodile Crush: Why Florida’s Top Predator Isn’t Always the One You Think appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nBurmese pythons achieved the near-total disappearance of 3 native species in the Florida Everglades.\n\nSome species, such as foxes, marsh rabbits, and cottontail rabbits, have almost completely disappeared because of pythons in the area.\n\n2005 field data counterintuitively confirm that a Burmese python can consume an entire American alligator.\n\nPythons utilize nest-raiding to win the battle before crocodiles ever reach the showdown.\n\nWho do you think would win a fight between a python and a crocodile in Florida?\n\nGenerally, we would look to real-life examples for clues, but surprisingly, there isn’t very much of that. While there are a few examples of pythons getting into it with alligators in Florida, they don’t seem to have many significant interactions with crocodiles.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that we can’t wager a pretty good guess on our own, though. We can actually take a look at pythons and crocodiles in Florida and see who would emerge victorious in an encounter between them.\n\nThe Burmese python is not a native species in Florida. However, they are often found around the Everglades in South Florida. Native to Southeast Asia, Burmese pythons were first brought to the United States as exotic pets. Some pet owners ended up releasing the snakes into the wild, and the problem began.\n\nThe Burmese python is now considered to be a nuisance to the Everglades ecosystem, and for good reason. These pythons compete with native animals for food. They have also caused severe declines in many native species, including bobcats, opossums, and raccoons.\n\nSome species, such as foxes, marsh rabbits, and cottontail rabbits, have almost completely disappeared because of pythons.\n\nIn fact, they’ve even been known to eat alligators in some cases. In 2005, in the Florida Everglades, the body of a Burmese python was found with an American alligator in its stomach!\n\nThe American crocodile, or Crocodylus acutus, generally populate South Florida. This is the northern end of the crocodile’s range in most cases. They can be found in coves, ponds, and creeks in mangrove swamps, and they typically inhabit saltwater or brackish areas.\n\nFloridians will often see crocodiles basking in the sun. Because they’re ectothermic animals, they rely on external heat to regulate their body temperatures.\n\nThey are the largest reptiles on earth and are said to be able to produce tears. They can’t chew their food, and to improve digestion, they have been known to swallow rocks. Crocodiles also have special hearts. Their hearts have four chambers just like humans do!\n\nShy and reclusive, they’re generally not a danger to people. If they’re approached by a person while basking in the sun, they’ll usually just quickly escape into the water.\n\nAmerican crocodiles typically eat small mammals, frogs, fish, turtles, and birds. Humans are the main threats to crocodiles because of habitat destruction and illegal hunting.\n\nCrocodile nests are also in danger due to predators, such as birds, crabs, and raccoons. In some cases, pythons will even eat alligator and crocodile eggs.\n\nPythons live in tropical areas of Asia and Africa. They can thrive in either wet or dry environments; however, they are freshwater and fully marine. They like it where it is hot and wet so their bodies can stay warm. They are usually found in rainforests, woodlands, grasslands, swamps, and shrubs.\n\nThese types of environments are home to many different creatures, such as the crocodile. That’s why these creatures are natural enemies because they share the same waters and wetlands.\n\nIf a Ball Python are able to survive adulthood, they can live about 10 to 15 years in the wild. However, the expected lifespan for a ball python living in captivity is around 30 years. Some, however, have been recorded to live over 50 years old when cared for properly.\n\nWhen predicting who would win in a battle between a python and a crocodile, we need to consider all of the factors. Knowledge of the physical features of both of these animals is very helpful in this process.\n\nPythons are often longer than crocodiles, reaching up to 26 feet long, while crocodiles usually aren’t more than 20 feet long. However, crocodiles do have the size advantage, as they tend to be much heavier. While a python is typically no more than about 200 pounds, a crocodile can be up to 2,000 pounds.\n\nCrocodiles have the size advantage over pythons.\n\nBoth pythons and crocodiles have the ability to stay submerged under water for stretches of time. However, crocodiles are much faster, being able to run up to about 25 miles per hour in some cases. Pythons only slither at about one mile per hour. Even if crocodiles can only run for short distances, they can easily catch up to a python in most cases.\n\nCrocodiles have the speed advantage over pythons.\n\nPythons do have the ability to use heat sensors and chemical receptors to stalk their prey. However, they typically have poor eyesight. Crocodiles have better eyesight and are able to see in the dark. They have strong senses of hearing and smell, as well as the ability to sense even subtle changes in pressure.\n\nCrocodiles have keener senses than pythons.\n\nPythons and crocodiles are both relatively large animals, although crocodiles are significantly larger. Pythons can camouflage themselves fairly effectively. Pythons and crocodiles both have the ability to submerge themselves underwater.\n\nIn terms of physical defenses, it’s a tie between pythons and crocodiles.\n\nBoth pythons and crocodiles are known for surprise attacks. Pythons have sharp teeth and the ability to constrict their prey with their bodies. Their bite is painful, but they’re not venomous, and it is not a strong enough bite to be fatal in most cases. Crocodiles, on the other hand, have the strongest bite ever seen in a living animal.\n\nGiven the vital stats of both competitors in this fight, we’d have to say that in an encounter between a python and a crocodile in Florida, the crocodile would probably be the winner.\n\nOf course, pythons are not completely powerless. If they’re able to get past a crocodile mother and eat crocodile eggs, they can prevent crocodiles from even getting to the fight in the first place.\n\nPythons can clearly hold their own, which is why they are so successful as an invasive species in Florida. But given the size and strength of the crocodile, it would likely be no contest between the two. Perhaps at some point, we’ll see evidence of crocodiles helping to control this invasive species.\n\nThe simple answer here is yes. The python lives in an aquatic type habitat and while swimming it is vulnerable to attack. This means that if a python is in the water, it is within perfect striking conditions for crocodiles. While younger snakes can be captured and eaten more easily by a crocodile of any size. The older python the larger it gets, so depending on the age of the snake the crocodile may not attack.\n\nThe post Crocodile Crush: Why Florida’s Top Predator Isn’t Always the One You Think appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "fullText": "Florida State Seminoles transfer defensive back Edwin Joseph is committing to Ole Miss via the Transfer Portal, On3 has learned. He spent the previous three seasons with the Seminoles.\n\nEdwin Joseph is a native of Hollywood, Florida, where he played at Chaminade-Madonna Prep. He was a four-star recruit in the Class of 2023. Within that recruiting cycle, Joseph was the 345th-ranked player overall and the 11th-ranked athlete.\n\nWhile in high school, Joseph won back-to-back state championships. In 2022, he was also named a Nat Moore Trophy finalist.\n\nIn 2023, Joseph would play in four games, utilizing a redshirt that season. By 2024, he had played in all 12 games for the Florida State defense, and in 2025, he was a consistent starter at the safety position. For his career, he’d finish playing in 28 games for the Seminoles.\n\nDuring that time, he had 51 total tackles, 7.0 tackles for a loss, and 1.5 sacks. He would also snag four interceptions and defend nine passes. The vast majority of that production came during the 2025 season.\n\nEdwin Joseph and Mike Norvell did have a public back-and-forth during the season. That wasn’t the first time those two teams had publicly butted heads.\n\nIt was a difficult two seasons for Florida State on the whole. After winning the ACC in 2023, the Seminoles have failed to make a bowl game in the two subsequent years.\n\nThat included bottoming out to 2-10 in 2024 and going just 3-13 in ACC play during that time. Now, it appears as though the Seminoles will undergo some heavy turnover in the Transfer Portal, which Norvell will quickly need to address.\n\nNow, Joseph is going to be looking for an opportunity in Oxford. He’ll have two seasons of eligibility remaining once he gets there.\n\nMoreover, Joseph was rated as a four-star prospect in the On3 Transfer Portal Industry Rankings. He was the No. 75 overall recruit, and the No. 4 overall safety available after entering their name into the portal before committing to a new beginning. You can check out the full rankings HERE to see where each athlete slots in.\n\nThe 2025-26 college football transfer portal will last 15 days, spanning from Jan. 2 to Jan. 16, the NCAA decided. While players have just over two weeks  to enter the portal, they’re not under a deadline to commit when they enter. Traditionally, the cut-off for committing has been how late a school can enroll a player through admissions, so it varies throughout the sport.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\n— On3’s Dan Morrison contributed to this article.",

    "fullText": "As a single mom, Crystal Roure was fiercely protective of her children.\n\nSo when she started dating a handsome man from church, Crystal didn’t introduce him right away. In fact, she waited until they had dated for a full year before he met the kids.\n\n“She took her time,\" Crystal's sister, Stephanie Roure, told USA TODAY this week. \"She did have a happy glow that I haven't seen in a long time ... My sister trusted him and fell in love with him. She finally found her happy ever after.\"\n\nBut on Dec. 22, just two years after Crystal married Jason Kenney, he would end up killing her and shooting her 13-year-old daughter in the face in their Florida home − all over an argument about watching a football game three days before Christmas, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office. Kenney later fatally shot himself.\n\nThe crime during the December holidays shocked the nation.\n\n“The 13-year-old girl begged not to be shot – ‘Please don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me,’” Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a news conference the week of the attack. “And he shot her twice.”\n\nNow as Crystal's family reels from grief and shock, USA TODAY is telling her story and how she used her final moments alive to save her children.\n\nFrom an early age, Crystal Roure showed ambition and a commitment to hard work.\n\nHer sister Stephanie recalled how Crystal did well in school and thrived when she got her first job at T.G.I. Friday's as a teenager, quickly graduating from hostess to server.\n\n\"What set her apart from others was she didn't just work for a paycheck ... she worked for the experience,\" Stephanie said. \"She worked for the knowledge. She worked to prove to herself she was able to do things and not give up.\"\n\nBut when she became a mom at the age of 25, \"everything she did from that moment on was for her children.\"\n\n\"She worked harder and longer,\" Stephanie said. \"And somehow she was superwoman. She managed to hold down a full-time job and being a full-time mother.\"\n\nThough Crystal had to juggle work and the kids all while being single, she didn't miss a school function, award ceremony or field trip. She also managed to buy a house all on her own, \"because she was a smart woman,\" Stephanie said.\n\n\"Her children were her world. She worked hard for them, to provide for them. She protected them,\" she said. \"They came first before anything.\"\n\nEarly in the relationship, Facebook photos show the pair smiling and kissing each other in many selfies. Other show them and the kids looking like a picture-perfect family, posing in front of a Christmas tree and at a baseball game.\n\nBut sometime after they married on Nov. 4, 2023, Stephanie said: \"My sister lost that glow she had.\"\n\nAt first, Stephanie chalked up the change to the fact that Crystal became pregnant with her third child pretty quickly after the wedding.\n\n\"I remember asking her, 'Are you OK?'\" Stephanie said. \"She said, 'Yes,' it's just this pregnancy was really kicking her butt because she was much older.\"\n\nThough Stephanie said she always had an \"ehh\" feeling about Kenney, she thought her sister was happy and safe.\n\nThat is until she got the worst phone call of her life.\n\nCrystal and her three kids spent the evening of Dec. 22 by the Christmas tree at their home in Highland City, just east of Tampa. Meanwhile Kenney was in his shed, drinking and watching Monday Night Football until about 11 p.m., Sheriff Judd said.\n\nWhen Kenney went inside the home and wanted to continue watching the game, a fight ensued. It became so scary that Crystal told her 12-year-old son to run to a neighbor's house and call 911, Judd said.\n\nAs the boy ran out, he heard the first gunshot. Responding deputies found Crystal dead inside, her 13-year-old daughter shot in the face and shoulder, and Jason Kenney gone. They also found a letter Crystal wrote to her husband telling him: \"You're drinking, you’re using cocaine again. This is not the way the family should be. You need God.\"\n\nThe 1-year-old daughter the couple shared was unharmed. The 13-year-old survived the gunshot wound after the bullet hit the bridge of her nose and deflected through the top of her head, Judd said.\n\nAfter shooting his wife and step-daughter, Kenney drove in his truck to his late father's home and called his sister to say he had \"done something very, very bad\" and that it was the last time they would ever talk, Judd said.\n\nDeputies tracked Kenney down to a shed on his father's property. When they called for him to come out, they heard a single gunshot and found Kenney dead inside.\n\nJudd said that a relative told deputies that Kenney had been beating on Crystal \"for a while,\" though the sheriff's office has no records of any domestic violence calls or charges. Jason Kenney had no criminal history, Judd said.\n\n\"He absolutely destroyed a family,\" Judd said. \"When you go in there, there is a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of Christmas presents under the tree, just like the nuclear family should be ... and it ends up this way.\"\n\nCrystal's family is leaning on each other as they absorb the shock of her murder and raising funds for the children. Crystal's 13-year-old daughter \"is doing well on her recovery\" and \"it really is a miracle that the bullet missed every major thing,\" Stephanie said.\n\nAs for any abuse leading up to the tragedy, Stephanie said it's possible but she wasn't aware of any.\n\n\"After they were married I know she said he was drinking a lot more but she said that he was going to stop and said he would get help with it. Obviously that didn't happen,\" she said, adding that when she went over to visit, Kenney would \"sit outside in the shed playing games on his phone and smoking his cigarettes.\"\n\n\"If there was abuse happening he must have scared her to the point not to say or do anything because the type of person my sister was she would have left at the first sight of trouble because she would protect her kids,\" she said. \"But that's a question we'll never have answers to.\"\n\nStephanie said she's angry that Kenney killed her sister and tried to kill her niece but that she's so proud of Crystal and her nephew's actions that night.\n\n\"My sister died a hero for protecting her children and getting my nephew out of the house to make the 911 call,\" she said. \"She did that. She saved their lives and by doing so my nephew saved his sister's life, and thank God the baby was untouched.\"\n\nStephanie said she is going to do her best to teach her 1-year-old niece all about who her mom was.\n\n\"I will never let these kids forget the love and strength and courage she had for them,\" she said. \"They will always know that she loved them and put them first.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Florida mom of three killed by husband over NFL game 'died a hero'",

    "description": "One night at the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach wasn't enough time to take advantage of amenities like a five-star spa and a private beach.",
    "fullText": "As I'm stuck in my NYC apartment on a brisk day in January, I can't help but daydream about the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach in Florida. I spent one night there in October 2025 and booked the cheapest available room for $920.\n\nSitting in a cushioned rattan chair on my balcony as the sun went down, I could see the pool surrounded by palms and cabanas, tropical gardens, and the five-star hotel's private beach. It was the epitome of tropical luxury, and I couldn't believe I'd be leaving in the morning.\n\nThe oceanfront hotel in Palm Beach, Florida, is four stories tall with 207 rooms and suites — all of which have their own balcony.\n\nI've stayed at three Four Seasons hotels, and one thing I've learned is that each location is designed to suit the destination. So I wasn't surprised when I stepped inside the lobby and found a tropical decor style.\n\nWith details like chandeliers resembling ropes and pastel pillows patterned with fruit and leaves, it was impossible to forget I was in Florida.\n\nI booked a Palm View room, complete with a king-sized bed across from a TV, a small sitting area, and plenty of floor space. The interior design blended midcentury modern furnishings with pastel accents, making the room feel like a little beach house.\n\nIt was larger than most hotel room balconies I've seen, and there was a table and two cushioned chairs. As the sun began to set, I sat and took in the view of the gardens and the ocean. I long for more sunsets on this balcony.\n\nThe spa features a eucalyptus steam room, a saltwater whirlpool, and a range of treatments, including massages and facials. With less than 24 hours at this hotel, I didn't have time to use the spa.\n\nIf I had another night at the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach, I would have dined at Florie's.\n\nHerbs in the seasonal cocktails at Florie's Bar come straight from the hotel's garden. For those like me who don't drink, there are plenty of non-alcoholic cocktails available.\n\nThe restaurant serves dishes cooked over a live fire, from pizzas to steaks and fish entrées.\n\nI would also have loved to dine on the shaded patio at Seaway, a seafood restaurant with a wide selection of proteins, including lobster, stone crab, and local red snappers, as well as oysters, tiger shrimp, and fresh tuna.\n\nMany of the dishes feature tropical ingredients, such as coconut, pomegranate, and mango.\n\nI wish I'd had time to relax by the pool while being served frozen fruit and cooling towels.\n\nHow often do you find a pristine beach free of crowds on a hot day?\n\nJust past the pool at the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach, a sandy pathway leads to a private beach exclusive to Four Seasons guests. When I went, it was quiet and mostly empty. I wish I could have spent more time on this exclusive strip of the Florida coastline.\n\nTo truly relax into the luxury beach vibe of this five-star resort, I'll have to return for a longer stay to try the restaurants, experience poolside service, and spend more time on a quiet, peaceful beach.",

    "description": "The coldest air will be short-lived. By midweek, most of Florida is expected to be back to a more normal winter weather routine.",
    "fullText": "A vigorous cold front is forecast to slide through Florida with confidence increasing that the pulse of winter chill will be felt all the way to the Keys.\n\nThe Canadian-cooled air is expected to reach the Panhandle on Sunday, Jan. 11 with wind chill temperatures possibly plummeting into the 20s during the early morning hours of Monday, Jan. 12 and daytime highs reaching only into the low 50s.\n\nIn the southern reaches of the state, low temperatures could dip into the upper 40s to mid-50s inland with the lower 60s felt along the water-warmed coasts. Daytime highs should hover around 70 degrees early in the week for much of South Florida.\n\nWhile meteorologists aren’t expecting the same slap of frigid temperatures that welcomed in the New Year — West Palm Beach got socked by a mercury reading of 39 degrees on Dec. 31 — it will be a change from more recent record-challenging heat:\n\nApalachicola sizzled at 77 degrees on Jan. 7, tying its record warm temperature set for that day in 1974.\n\nMiami reached 82 degrees, a full 6 degrees warmer than normal but below the 87-degree record set for that day in 2017.\n\nFort Pierce, on the Treasure Coast, was 84 degrees Jan. 7. That's 9 degrees above normal and near the record high of 86 set in 1990.\n\n“Everyone is talking about how warm it is and I’m thrilled with it. I love really warm weather,” said Lynn Murphy, who was working the front desk at the Driftwood Inn in the Panhandle city of Mexico Beach. “The high today (Jan. 8) is supposed to be 73 and I’m in long sleeves wishing I had a jacket.”\n\nMore: Dense fog blankets Florida: Advisories from the Panhandle to Miami\n\nThe cold front is attached to a zippy area of low pressure that will move northeast with a mix of rain and snow for areas from Michigan to Maine.\n\nRain chances increase for the western reaches of the Panhandle on Friday, Jan. 9, with up to an 80% chance of showers in Pensacola on Saturday, Jan. 10.\n\nAnd while North Florida could get whacked with temperatures in the upper 30s, the chill will moderate as it moves down the Peninsula.\n\n“Crystal River, Cedar Key, maybe Gainesville will be near the southern edge of the colder temperatures below 40 degrees,” said Brandon Buckingham, a meteorologist with AccuWeather. “It’s not a pure Arctic air mass but will be a return of a typical winter weather pattern.”\n\nA swirl of high pressure has dominated the southeast, pumping tropical air into more northerly latitudes, and allowing temperatures to rise. Weather gauges monitored by the Southeast Regional Climate Center have the average temperatures from Pensacola to Leesburg west of Daytona Beach at up to 9 degrees warmer than normal this month.\n\nEast coast cities from Miami to Vero Beach are still recovering from the New Year’s chill with temperatures between 1 and 2 degrees below normal since Jan. 1.\n\n“This won’t be like what we saw last time,\" said Miami-based National Weather Service meteorologist George Rizzuto trying to temper expectations. “We will see slightly reduced humidity and slightly reduced temperatures. The parent cyclone is going to be too far to the northeast.”\n\nThe coldest air will be short-lived. By midweek, most of Florida is expected to be back to a more normal winter weather routine.\n\nKimberly Miller is a journalist for the USA TODAY NETWORK FLORIDA.

    "title": "Google billionaire Larry Page copies the Jeff Bezos playbook, buying a $173 million Miami compound that will save him millions in taxes",
    "description": "Critics warned a wealth tax in California would lead to a billionaire exodus. Florida says come on in, the water's warm.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page has quietly—or loudly—joined the billionaire exodus from California, shifting businesses east and dropping about $173 million on two ultra-luxury waterfront mansions in Miami’s Coconut Grove in a move that looks strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos’ relocation playbook. The timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look downright Bezos-ian.​\n\nIn late December and early January, The Wall Street Journal reported, Page snapped up two neighboring estates in Miami’s Coconut Grove, paying roughly $101.5 million for one waterfront compound and $71.9 million for another in an off‑market deal, for a combined outlay of about $173.4 million. One of the homes, previously listed for $135 million, spans 13 bedrooms and 15.5 bathrooms and sits directly on the water, while the second, bought from heiress Sloan Lindemann Barnett and her husband Roger Barnett, nearly doubled in value in less than five years.​\n\nThe purchases plant Page squarely inside one of Miami’s most exclusive enclaves, long favored by global elites seeking privacy, water access, and low‑key luxury. Local brokers say his splashy entry is part of a broader surge of high‑net‑worth Californians scouting Coconut Grove and other South Florida neighborhoods as they hedge against looming tax changes while upgrading to trophy waterfront properties. The real-estate purchases double as both a luxury retreat and a massive tax‑savings vehicle, with Page the most prominent of California’s ultrawealthy choosing to leave as state lawmakers are targeting fortunes like his with an aggressive wealth‑tax push.\n\nBehind the real-estate headlines, Page has been methodically severing his financial and legal ties to California ahead of a proposed wealth tax that targets residents worth more than $1 billion. Regulatory filings show he has moved his family office and several investment and holding entities out of the state, Business Insider reported, reincorporating key vehicles in Delaware and listing new business addresses in Florida.​\n\nThe New York Times previously reported Page had been telling associates he was considering Florida specifically because of a proposed ballot measure that would impose a 5% annual levy on the worldwide assets of billionaires domiciled in California. If passed and applied retroactively to residents as of Jan. 1, 2026, analysts estimate the tax could cost Page—currently ranked as the world’s second‑richest person—well over $10 billion.\n\n​​Some Silicon Valley executives, notably Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, warned such an outcome was possible, saying in late December founders would have to sell off parts of their companies to pay for “fraud, waste, and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.” California Rep. Ro Khanna responded to the Times‘ reporting that Page and Peter Thiel were looking to leave by flagging the story on X and saying, seemingly sarcastically in the style of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “I will miss them very much.”",

Less than a month after announcing his intent to transfer, Lagway reportedly committed to Baylor, according to Rivals.com.\n\nLagway's decision comes a day after he visited the school and was spotted attending a Baylor basketball game with Bears football coach Dave Aranda.\n\nBREAKING: Florida transfer QB DJ Lagway has committed to Baylor, @Hayesfawcett3 reports🐻https://t.co/WDcp436N9Y pic.twitter.com/GeiyboBmFg\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 8, 2026\n\nLagway, considered the top quarterback in the 2024 class, turned in a strong freshman season with the Gators. After starting the year on the bench, Lagway was pushed into the starting lineup following an injury to Graham Mertz.\n\nLagway threw for 456 yards and three scores in his first start, and then led Florida to a 6-1 record down the stretch, taking down multiple ranked opponents before beating Tulane in a bowl game.\n\nThat strong finish led to heightened expectations for both Lagway and Florida entering the 2025 season. Florida opened the year ranked No. 15 in the AP poll, and then rose to No. 13 after taking down LIU to kick off the season. But a loss to South Florida the following week dropped Florida out of the top-25.\n\nThat proved to be a harbinger of what was to come. Florida finished the year 4-8 and failed to jump back into the top-25 the rest of the way.\n\nLagway played a significant role in the team's demise. After being limited by shoulder issues last offseason, Lagway didn't play up to expectations as a sophomore, finishing the year with just 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 12 games.",

    "description": "The Seminoles have a new punter",
    "fullText": "The Florida State Seminoles are welcoming a new punter to Tallahassee. Daniel Hughes, who spent the 2025 season with the New Mexico Lobos, is transferring to FSU.\n\nHughes is 27 years old and is originally from Melbourne, Australia, and stands 6-foot-5, weighing 235 pounds. He has three years of eligibility remaining and owns a 4.0 GPA. He has a respectable social media following as well, and this article sheds some light on his uniqueness.\n\nHughes had quite a year in New Mexico after spending his prior season in JUCO. He put up numbers that weren’t school records only due to lack of total number of punts in New Mexico’s excellent offense. His net average of 43.6 yards per punt (on 37 total punts) would have been good for the second-best mark in Mountain West Conference history in addition to becoming a New Mexico school record.\n\nFrom the press release for his Honorable Mention All-Mountain West team selection:\n\nDaniel Hughes – Honorable Mention (P)\n\nA Ray Guy Award semifinalist, he is averaging 45.9 yards per punt with a net of 43.6 on just 37 punts with 12 inside the 20 and 13 punts of 50 yards or more. He has not shown up in the stats all season because of the lack of punts by UNM, but would be 16th nationally in punting.\n\nNew Mexico is seventh nationally in net punting, and the 43.6-yard average would easily be a school record, and it would be the second-best net punting mark in Mountain West history. He has averaged at least 46.0 yards per punt in seven of the 12 games this season (and it’s really seven of 11 as UNM didn’t punt against Nevada). Opponents are averaging 3.9 per return, and opponents have muffed three of his punts (8.1%).\n\nJunior College: Lettered in football for one season at City College of San Francisco … played in 10 games as a freshman, punting 49 times for a 37.3 yard average … had a long of 62 … pinned his opponents inside the 20 18 times on the season and forced 13 fair catches … had just two touchbacks.\n\nHigh School: Hughes did not play football at Mount Erin … he did play Footy in the Victorian Football League (VFL), playing for the Northern Bullants in 2021 and 2022, seeing action in 15 games.",

    "description": "About 15 years ago, I moved to a small town in Florida, three hours from where I grew up in Miami. Living this far from my hometown has been great.",
    "fullText": "Nearly 15 years ago, I moved to a small town on Florida's Space Coast, about three hours away from where I grew up in Miami.\n\nI hadn't planned to move out of the city forever, but I've since fallen in love with my quieter, slower pace of life. Fortunately, I'm not too far from where I grew up — and I've never stopped going back to Miami for visits a few times a year.\n\nI don't regret moving, and it turns out that living just a short drive from home comes with a lot of perks.\n\nAt first, returning to Miami after having just moved away felt so different.\n\nI'd been feeling pretty homesick, and I didn't immediately embrace small-town living in my new slice of Florida. However, once I was back home, I realized I felt most like myself in Miami — something I doubt I'd ever have noticed if I had never left.\n\nThat said, moving away ultimately helped me better understand myself and how my values have been shaped.\n\nFor instance, I forget how much everyday can feel like a party in Miami until I go back, and then I see that lively city is where I get the perspective that life should be celebrated.\n\nI've realized that even though I've left Miami, I can carry some of my favorite parts of the city with me wherever I go — and that's been really empowering.\n\nFor example, one of the things I miss most about Miami is its incredible Cuban food scene. I've yet to find anything as good where I live now, so I've learned how to make many of my favorite Cuban dishes at home.\n\nWith Cuban food being so accessible and affordable in Miami, I likely never would've learned how to cook any of it on my own if I still lived there.\n\nAnd, whenever I'm back in Miami, I still always stop at all of my favorite restaurants that just can't quite be replicated anywhere else.\n\nAll of my closest friends and some family members still live in Miami, so when I visit, I really get to spend a lot of time with whoever I'm staying with.\n\nWhile I'm often sad that we don't live close by and can't see each other all the time, I probably spend more quality time with them now than I did when I lived there.\n\nIn some ways, it's easier to see someone when it requires a bit of intentional planning, and you can't just pop by each other's homes anytime.\n\nSince I'm no longer a local, I get to see the city from a new perspective. I've loved experiencing the restaurants, nightlife, and beaches as visitors do — it's truly an energetic and unique place.\n\nI've noticed things that I didn't even realize I missed, such as driving around specific parts of Miami. I get to see how things are changing, but even places that have been there my whole life somehow seem more novel to me now.\n\nSince I've moved away, I've become more appreciative of certain things back home, particularly the food and my friendships.\n\nI feel really lucky to live just a short drive from the city I grew up in, which also happens to be a really fun place to visit. I'm aware that if home were a plane ride away, I definitely wouldn't be able to visit as often.\n\nWhen I'm there, I get to remember who I am and where I come from. However, I also get to see where I grew up in a new light, almost as if I were an outsider experiencing something for the first time.\n\nI was never really proud of being from Miami when I lived there, but now that I've sort of seen it as a tourist, I have a newfound pride for where I'm from.",

    "fullText": "Carson Beck family tree: Meet sister Kylie, ex-NBA cheerleader mom and more about Florida roots originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDoes Carson Beck have a girlfriend?\n\nNot many college quarterbacks can say they had a resume the caliber of Carson Beck's.\n\nWhile both of his championships came as a backup when he played for the Georgia Bulldogs, Beck still cemented himself as a starter by 2023, when he threw for 3,941 yards and had 28 total touchdowns for Georgia. Then, Beck decided to play one last year in college, transferring to the Miami Hurricanes for a reported hefty NIL package.\n\nThose around Beck have been in the spotlight often, from his past relationship with Miami women's basketball star Hanna Cavinder, to his family, including his mom and sister.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of Beck's family tree.\n\nMORE: Why did Carson Beck transfer from Georgia to Miami?\n\nCarson Beck's sister is Kylie Beck. She is a former cheerleader and member of the dance team at Georgia, where she attended at the same time as her brother.\n\nWhen the quarterback departed Georgia for Miami, Kylie Beck, a sophomore at the time, also shared that she was leaving the Bulldogs behind. It hasn't been confirmed whether she also chose to attend Miami, but she's remained a close supporter of her brother with the Hurricanes.\n\n“Thank you letter to Athens. When one door closes, another door always opens with something greater on the other side,\" Beck wrote, per The Athlete Lifestyle on SI. \"I entered this new city hoping for greatness, success and happiness. Although there are times there was an abundance of these things, there were also times when I was at the lowest I’ve ever been and my family and I went through the hardest things we’ve ever dealt with. To say this experience has been a whirlwind of emotions would be an understatement.\n\nI am thankful that I’ve been able to call Athens my home for the past five years, traveling to games to support my brother and then making my dream a reality this past year when i was awarded the opportunity to be both a Georgette & Dance Dawg. It was such a blessing being by my brothers side and cheering him on from the field.\"\n\nLike Carson, Kylie is from Jacksonville, Florida, so the quarterback's transfer to Miami was closer to their home state.\n\nWhether as a Georgia cheerleader or just as a fan, Kylie has been a very vocal supporter of her brother's football career. She's shared plenty of social media posts about Carson.\n\nKylie Beck has also become known for her gameday outfits.\n\nKylie Beck is not a cheerleader for the Dallas Cowboys. However, she was invited to dance with the Cowboys cheerleaders in March 2025, posing on the field afterward.\n\nMORE: How does NIL money work in college football?\n\nCarson Beck's mom is Tracy Beck. She grew up in Clinton, Md., went to Maryland for college and danced for the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards) in the past, per The Athletic. Tracy Beck is a kindergarten teacher at Alimacani Elementary School in Jacksonville, Florida, where her kids were raised.\n\nLike the rest of Carson's family, Tracy has been a very public supporter of the quarterback's career.\n\nIn 2024, she told The Athletic that it's not \"who Carson is\" to remain in college as long as he had because of NIL.\n\n“There was no negotiating for money. That’s not who Kirby is. That’s not who this program is about, and that’s not who Carson is,” she said. “I think it’s cool he can do NIL this year and have an opportunity for all that. And those boys work so hard. I have never seen kids work as hard as they do. I mean it’s a full-time job to be a football player at the University of Georgia.\"\n\nHowever, Tracy also told The Athletic that she supports Carson's decision to buy a luxury car with his NIL money, as he's been focused on football first.\n\n“He’s so laid back and so focused on football and Georgia and his team. To him, that’s such a cool thing and be able to represent and do things for Georgia and for NIL,” she said. “But at the end of the day, talking about the car, it’s just a car. It’s very cool and amazing that he can drive something like that. But at the end of the day, it’s more about the team and coming back to try and do what they want to do this year.”\n\n\"Beck's Brigade\" is a gameday tailgate support group for Carson Beck that was started by his mother. Per Dawg Nation, Tracy Beck previously said watching Carson play always makes her nervous.\n\n“Honestly, he tells me to relax,” she said, per Dawg Nation. “I promise you that. He says ‘Don’t be nervous’ and ‘Be calm’ and ‘I’ve got this’ and ‘Tell everybody around you to not be nervous’ because it is nerve-wracking to be the quarterback’s mom and anybody’s mom.\n\n“Now some games have been close and I’ll cry at the end when we win and I’ll go out on the field.”\n\nMORE: Ranking the 19 greatest Miami players of all time\n\nCarson Beck's dad is Chris Beck. He is a former player at Navy, where he played linebacker from 1989-92, and he is now a retired Naval officer.\n\nWhen Carson Beck played for the Pablo Creek Saints, his dad was his coach, per the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nMORE:Carson Beck's tattoos, explained\n\nNo, Carson Beck's parents are no longer married.\n\nIt's unknown when Chris and Tracy Beck divorced, but according to EssentiallySports, the couple met in Annapolis, Maryland, before later moving to Florida and welcoming Carson in 2002, then Kylie.\n\nMORE:History of Miami QBs in the NFL, from Jim Kelly to Cam Ward\n\nAs of January 2026, Carson Beck hasn't been confirmed to be in a relationship with anyone.\n\nPreviously, he was in a high-profile relationship with Hanna Cavinder, a basketball player at Miami and popular social media influencer. Beck and Cavinder began dating in July 2024, per People, but rumors that they had split began in March 2025, not too long after Beck transferred to Miami and joined his girlfriend as a Hurricanes athlete.\n\nAt the time, per People, Cavinder had removed all signs of Beck from her Instagram profile, while her twin sister, Haley, posted on social media suggesting she had \"a gut feeling about a relationship\" and saw \"someone in my life that's hurting.\"\n\nBeck later confirmed his split with Cavinder to ESPN, saying, \"You make mistakes as a person, but it sucks that you have to go through something like that with someone that you care about, and now it's all over the Internet.\"\n\n\"Half of what you see in the media is true,\" Beck told ESPN. \"Half of what you see is not true. So, people pick their side of the story and run with it. The people that know the truth know the truth. But it's been difficult.\"\n\nMORE: When is the last time Miami won a championship in football?\n\nCarson Beck was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. He attended Mandarin High School; in 2018, he won the Florida \"Mr. Football\" award after throwing for 3,546 yards and 30 touchdowns as a junior.\n\nBeck led Mandarin to a state championship, and after initially committing to Florida as a baseball prospect, he switched to college football. Beck first committed to Alabama, then flipped his decision to Georgia and joined the Bulldogs in 2020.\n\nHas Carson Beck won a championship?",

    "description": "South Florida potentially finds its first QB of the Brian Hartline era. Van Buren arrives with 12 starts.",
    "fullText": "2026 represents a new chapter for South Florida football, as the Bulls flip from the Alex Golesh era to the Brian Hartline era.\n\nSouth Florida lost three-year starter Byrum Brown in the transfer portal, as the star dual-threat quarterback followed Golesh to Auburn. In return, the Bulls received a quarterback with substantial starting experience in the SEC.\n\nSouth Florida received a commitment on Wednesday, Jan. 7 from quarterback Michael Van Buren Jr., who suited up at Mississippi State in 2024 and LSU in 2025. Van Buren arrives with 12 games of starting experience, serving the majority of the 2024 campaign as the Bulldogs’ first-string QB and taking over as the Tigers’ starter during the last quarter and change of 2025.\n\nAs a true freshman in 2024, Van Buren threw for 1,886 yards, 11 touchdowns, and seven interceptions on a 54.7 completion rate. He collected 300 passing yards in two games that year, notably firing for 306 yards and three touchdowns in a 41-31 track meet defeat at Georgia.\n\nVan Buren transferred to LSU in December 2024, entering the year as the backup to Garrett Nussmeier. He ultimately took over as the Tigers’ primary quarterback on Nov. 8 against Alabama and retained the starting role for the final four games. He captained victories over Arkansas and WKU and nearly guided LSU to a major upset over a CFP-bound Oklahoma squad. Van Buren earned his last start in purple and gold in the Texas Bowl vs. Houston, where he exhibited some of his best work to date. He accumulated 267 passing yards, three touchdowns, and zero interceptions on a 16-of-26 showing, guiding LSU to 35 points in a narrow defeat — when LSU never surpassed 25 against an FBS opponent in the regular season.\n\nVan Buren’s mobility also improved as a true sophomore, racking up 129 yards on the season (105 in his four starts). The Bowie, MD native rattled off a 15+ yard carry in all four starts — a helpful trait if South Florida wants a similar style QB to Byrum Brown.\n\nSpeaking of Brown, Van Buren enters Tampa with massive shoes to fill. Brown is the only quarterback in USF history to surpass 3,000 passing yards in a season, and he did it twice. Brown just set the record for most passing touchdowns in a season by any Bull by 28, and he left the program ranked third all-time in rushing yards at 2,265.\n\nVan Buren takes over as a potential starter under Hartline and his new staff, as the former SEC quarterback takes on his third different school in a three-year span.",

    "description": "Growing up in Fort Lauderdale and moving to New York City has taught me that the cities we dream of won't always meet our expectations, and that's OK.",
    "fullText": "For nearly 20 years of my life, I lived in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe beaches, palm trees, and Pub Subs (sub sandwiches from Publix, for those unfamiliar) that were part of other people's vacations were staples of my everyday life.\n\nMaybe that's why I started yearning for somewhere that wasn't as calm and steady as I was used to — somewhere like New York City.\n\nI visited NYC for the first time in 2016, and four visits later, I made it my goal to live there one day.\n\nEach trip welcomed me with new experiences and places to explore. Getting to walk out of my hotel with no set itinerary and discover local coffee shops or pocket parks was a feeling I genuinely believed couldn't be replicated elsewhere.\n\nUnlike my days in Florida, which sometimes felt repetitive, New York always felt fresh.\n\nSo, in July, I made the leap and moved to the Big Apple. Like other transplants in their early 20s, I wanted to feel like I was living in a place that mattered, and the city's energy was intoxicating.\n\nDay by day, since moving to New York City, I've become more aware of the realities that come with actually living in the place I dreamed of.\n\nAs a tourist, I curated my experiences, planned my trips around perfect weather, and was able to appreciate a slowed-down version of the city.\n\nBut living in the city comes with a pace that's impossible to ignore.\n\nPublic transportation is crowded, fast-paced, and something I've learned to take into account when planning my days. I've had to learn to make decisions faster, leave earlier than necessary, and accept that even the smallest disruptions can throw off my entire day.\n\nPlus, the so-called \"New York tax\" that forces me to spend at least $30 the moment I walk out the door has been a humbling dose of reality.\n\nMoments like schlepping groceries in bad weather have made me miss how South Florida provides more space to slow down, too.\n\nI used to see New York City as a fantasy, but as a resident, I'm realizing that maybe that was the version I created for the \"me\" who was just passing through.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still see New York City's appeal — just not in the ways I used to. In the same way tourists flock to the beaches I grew up on, I now see NYC as a destination people project their biggest hopes onto.\n\nAfter months of living here, I've come to realize that the mundane aspects of everyday life are what make the city feel like home, from catching an express train just before it leaves the station to waving to my building's super.\n\nAnd now, I'm able to take these lessons home to Fort Lauderdale when I visit, which I've come to see in a whole new light.\n\nOn my first trip home, the beaches I used to visit every other month, and the constant hot weather I'd tried to avoid, carried a sense of charm I had really never appreciated growing up.\n\nExperiencing it from the perspective of someone who left made me feel grateful for all the little details I used to overlook.\n\nAfter that visit, I finally understood: A place can lose its appeal once it becomes familiar, but that doesn't mean it's no longer special. A dream city may never truly live up to the images we create of it, and that's OK.\n\nI'm learning to love New York's imperfections and am enjoying rediscovering the beauty of South Florida as well.\n\nBut moreover, I'm learning to accept that home doesn't have to be a place that constantly amazes me. It's where I choose to keep building, flaws and all — and for now, that place is New York City.",

    "description": "I never thought I'd find my forever home in the Midwest, but I fell in love with a small, affordable town in Wisconsin that I love more than Florida.",
    "fullText": "After growing up in North Carolina, I moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, at the age of 18 for college. That's where I fell in love with my now-fiancée — and the surrounding Pinellas County.\n\nWe both adored Florida's beaches, took regular weekend trips to Key West and Manasota Key, and thoroughly enjoyed life in the Tampa Bay area.\n\nAt times, I thought we might just stay there forever — but after graduation, the world felt wide open. So, we started \"shopping around\" the country for a new place to call home.\n\nMy partner and I packed up my truck and started our adventure by road-tripping across the Western United States.\n\nWe camped in the Badlands, swam in the Yellowstone River, slept in a canyon in Idaho, and in 2020, landed in Portland, Oregon.\n\nPortland was the epitome of cool — the kind of place where you could hike in the morning, grab a craft beer at night, and feel like you were living the hipster dream.\n\nHowever, after six months, I found myself struggling with poor air quality from local wildfires and missing the familiarity of St. Pete.\n\nSo, we moved back to Florida, hoping to relive our college days with close friends and potentially settle down.\n\nHowever, my fiancée and I struggled to put down roots.\n\nPinellas County and its housing market had undergone significant changes while we'd been away. Homes were selling for significantly more than they had been a few years ago, and many of those prices were far beyond our budget.\n\nThe rental market remained competitive as ever, too. We ended up renting a 400-square-foot ADU in the area for about $1,100 a month. At the time, it was the only place we found within our budget that had in-unit laundry and a decent location.\n\nWe made it work, and I even became friends with my landlord and his wife. However, heavy rain routinely flooded part of the unit, and after one particularly severe hurricane, the carpet was so soaked it had to be removed.\n\nBetween the worsening storms and rising house (and insurance) prices in the area, the idea of buying our first home here felt increasingly unrealistic.\n\nWe'd already been spooked by Hurricane Irma in 2017, and this felt like a small taste of the possible issues to come if we stayed.\n\nFortunately, by this point, I had a solid remote job, and we'd been building up our savings to put toward a down payment on a house.\n\nNow, we had to figure out where to go next.\n\nMy fiancée suggested we move to southern Wisconsin, near where her family lived. Real estate was cheaper there, and we could stay with her parents while house-hunting.\n\nI agreed, we moved, and we're still happily here years later.\n\nOur lives immediately felt different in a southern Wisconsin county with a population of about 100,000, in a town of less than 10,000.\n\nAfter living in one of the most densely populated counties in Florida, home to nearly 1 million people, I was thrilled to find a quieter place to call home.\n\nI've also fallen in love with the Wisconsin outdoors and all the adventures it has to offer. I've hiked Kettle Moraine State Forest, surfed on Lake Michigan, tested new fishing holes, and explored the lakes I'd only heard about before moving.\n\nThe locals seemed to welcome us instantly, and the community feels rich and full of life — new businesses always seem to be opening: a huge coffee shop, a speakeasy bar, and even a high-end restaurant.\n\nPlus, the local \"lake life\" offered the same laid-back vibe we used to enjoy finding around Florida's beaches.\n\nSoon, we bought a four-bedroom house in the area, securing a mortgage that costs us less than $1,500 a month.\n\nIn less than a year, we'd gone from living in someone else's tiny suite to having our very own four-bedroom home for a comparable monthly cost. We could hardly believe it.\n\nSure, winters can be a lot colder and tougher out in the Midwest, and we sometimes miss Florida, but I like the life we've built.\n\nI always say if the hipsters in Portland or the beach bums in Florida knew about small-town Wisconsin, they'd move here in a heartbeat (or at least visit in the summers).",

    "description": "Florida is adding depth to the defensive line. Baylor DL transfer DK Kalu committed to the Gators on Monday.",
    "fullText": "Former Baylor redshirt sophomore defensive tackle DK Kalu has committed to the Florida Gators.\n\nKalu announced his decision on Monday, Jan. 5, joining former teammate DJ Coleman in moving from Baylor to Florida. A consensus three-star prospect out of high school, Kalu redshirted in 2023 after not seeing any action as a true freshman. He played three games as a reserve defensive lineman in 2024, making one start and recording one solo tackle.\n\nIn 2025, Kalu played 281 total snaps, earning a 59.7 offensive grade, a 61.5 run-defense grade, a 68.4 tackling grade (49th among Big 12 defensive linemen) and a 54.0 pass-rushing grade from Pro Football Focus. He played in nine games, starting six, recording 11 total tackles (four solo) and 0.5 tackles for a loss.\n\n247Sports ranks Kalu No. 705 overall and No. 48 among defensive linemen in the 2026 transfer cycle. On3 has him at No. 684 and No. 75, respectively.\n\nHe was on campus this weekend for an official visit.\n\nCommitted 🐊 pic.twitter.com/WU9S8wrBkV\n\n— DK Kalu🇳🇬🤴🏿 (@dk_kalu) January 5, 2026\n\nFollowing transfer portal losses, including starter Michai Boireau, the Gators have five defensive linemen in 2026. Redshirt senior Jamari Lyons has starting potential, as does redshirt junior Brendan Bett. Kalu is a depth addition, but he will compete for a starting job. Florida also returns Joseph Mbatchou and Jeramiah McCloud, and freshman Kendall Guervil recently signed as well.\n\nThe dilemma is that Boireau primarily played nose tackle for Florida last year, which none of the names mentioned above have much experience at. Lyons could step into that role, opening the door for Bett and Kalu to rotate alongside him. Florida could also add another defensive lineman from the transfer portal.\n\nAt 6-foot-4-inches, 309 pounds, Kalu provides size and depth to the position room.\n\nKalu is the fourth official transfer portal addition of the 2026 cycle for Florida, following Baylor safety DJ Coleman, James Madison tight end Lacota Dippre and Georgia Tech wide receiver Bailey Stockton.\n\nFlorida is also expected to land Georgia Tech quarterback Aaron Philo and interior offensive lineman Harrison Moore.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida Gators football earns commitment from Baylor DT DK Kalu",

    "description": "After moving from West Virginia to Miami in South Florida a few years ago, I've fallen in love with the great weather and budget travel deals.",
    "fullText": "Throughout my childhood, my family barely strayed from the parts of West Virginia's Appalachia region where I was born and raised.\n\nI spent college two hours away in Ohio, and during those years, I started traveling around the United States and to more distant places in Europe and Latin America.\n\nI love exploring the world, so when it was time to graduate and start a life somewhere new, I applied to jobs all around the country.\n\nI took the first one I could get, and it happened to be in Miami. I'd never been to Florida before, but I quickly found things in Dade County I enjoyed.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of living here, there are three big things I love about living in Miami — and one thing I still miss about West Virginia.\n\nA lot of people have opinions about this one, but as someone who grew up in a colder climate, I much prefer Miami weather.\n\nSummer aside, most weeks are sunny and fairly comfortable with a lot of days between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are pleasantly short, sunny, and warm.\n\nI also struggle with depression, which can be impacted by the seasons, so having the ability to go outside and get some sunshine any time of the year is a major bonus for me.\n\nThough summertime in Miami can be uncomfortably hot and humid and hurricane season is no joke, I still prefer the weather here to any place that experiences a harsher winter.\n\nAs a travel writer, I'm constantly booking trips and visiting new cities and countries. And when I'm not hopping on a plane or road tripping to a different part of Florida, I can still experience a variety of communities and cultures in Miami.\n\nMost people know Miami for its Cuban influence, but the city is also home to a huge variety of expats from other parts of Latin America, like Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina.\n\nThere's also a lot of diversity from other parts of the world, too. For example, Miami Beach has one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel, and there's also a huge variety of Bahamian, Jamaican and other Caribbean cultures here.\n\nMiami is constantly growing and changing, and I love that I can learn about so many different cultures without traveling too far.\n\nOne of my favorite perks of living in Miami truly is how easy and convenient it is to travel from the city.\n\nFor starters, there are two major airports nearby — Miami International Airport (MIA) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL).\n\nMiami is also the cruise capital of the world, and there are constantly ships sailing from the ports in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nI'm a budget traveler at heart, and I've scored some incredible travel deals from South Florida. I regularly find flights to Europe for less than $400 from these airports, and I can fly to many places around the US for less than $150.\n\nSince I moved to Florida, I've developed a deep appreciation for the beach. However, I still definitely miss the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nThey're the oldest mountain range in the United States, and these rolling hills are the perfect place for exploring. My favorite time to visit West Virginia is in the late spring or early summer when the trees are at their fullest and brightest.\n\nPalm trees are beautiful, but I definitely miss how serene and peaceful nature can be in West Virginia — especially when compared to how busy and chaotic Miami can feel sometimes.",

    "fullText": "Florida football landed a Power 4 conference quarterback out of the transfer portal, securing a commitment Georgia Tech quarterback Aaron Philo, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo brings dual threat ability and familiarity with the scheme under new Florida Gators offensive coordinator Buster Faulkner, who was his offensive coordinator at Georgia Tech for the last two seasons. He visited UF over the weekend along with teammate and wide receiver Bailey Stockwell.\n\nA redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining, the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo showed promise as a backup quarterback in two seasons with the Yellow Jackets, throwing for 938 yards with 2 TDs to 3 interceptions over two seasons while rushing for 95 yards and 1 TD. Philo has appeared in seven games over two seasons and while alternating with starter Haynes King, helped lead Georgia Tech to a 28-23 upset win over Miami on Nov. 9, 2024.\n\nA three-star recruit out of Prince Andrew Christian School in Bogart, Ga., Philo broke Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence's high school record for passing yards in the state of Georgia with 13,922 yards during his prep career.\n\nPhilo will compete with redshirt freshman Tramel Jones Jr. for the starting quarterback job at Florida. Jones, who announced his intention to return to UF in December, completed 21 of 35 passes for 191 yards and 2 TDs in two games as former UF quarterback DJ Lagway's backup last season. Florida also brings back redshirt sophomore quarterback Aidan Warner and adds incoming four-star freshman quarterback Will Griffin, who plans to enroll at UF this month for the spring semester.\n\nPhilo joins Baylor safety DJ Coleman as the second commitment in UF's 2026 transfer portal class.\n\nKevin Brockway is The Gainesville Sun’s Florida beat writer.

Tomahawk Nation’s Three Stars (Tim Alumbaugh, Josh Pick, and NoleThruandThru) have you covered with all the information below.\n\nThe transfer portal will be open for a two-week period only, from January 2-16, 2026. Exceptions exist for coaching changes (a 15-day window that starts five days after the new coach is hired) and CFP playoff participants who play on or after January 12 (five days after final game to enter the portal).\n\nThe spring football transfer window has been eliminated, leaving football with one offseason period for all transfer activity.\n\nThis is a solid article to read about the

    "description": "Cynthia Diekema, 61, was killed by an alligator while on a canoe ride with her husband in Florida last year",
    "fullText": "Cynthia Diekema, 61, was canoeing with her husband last year when they crashed into an alligator in their canoe and both fell into the water, according to a report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission recently obtained by PEOPLE\n\nThroughout the attack, he said that his wife seemed alert, but unable to speak and had a \"puzzled look on her face\"\n\nHer cause of death was listed as “multiple blunt force injuries from an alligator,\" according to the report.\n\nNew details have emerged about an alligator attack that claimed the life of a 61-year-old woman as her husband fought to save her life.\n\nOn May 6, around 4:02 p.m. local time, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission responded to an alligator encounter near the mouth of Tiger Creek in Polk County.\n\nThe woman, later identified as Cynthia Diekema, was canoeing with her husband when they encountered the reptile and both fell into the water, the FWC later shared.\n\nThe 11-foot, 4-inch alligator then bit Cynthia and pulled her into the water before she was \"later found deceased.\"\n\nNearly eight months after the attack, an incident summary report from the FWC, which was obtained by PEOPLE via a public records request, revealed additional information about what happened on that horrifying day.\n\nIn a sworn statement to authorities, David Diekema, Cynthia’s husband, said that he and his wife were traveling on an 11-foot plastic canoe that departed earlier that day from Lake Kissimmee State Park.\n\nOnce they entered the shallow waters of Tiger Creek, David says that they observed numerous alligators — and right before the attack, his wife commented on how they were \"about to go right over top of one,\" according to the report.\n\nAs the canoe crashed into the animal, which was resting on the bottom of the creek, the startled animal began to thrash, according to the report, which caused the canoe to capsize and sent the couple into the water.\n\nWhen he was able to stand up, David said he saw Cynthia’s torso in the alligator’s mouth.\n\nAccording to officials, he said he \"attempted to free her from the alligator's mouth for several minutes,\" but was unsuccessful.\n\nThroughout the ordeal, he said that his wife seemed alert, but unable to speak and had a \"puzzled look on her face.\"\n\nAt one point, the alligator whipped its tail, knocking David off of his feet, according to the report. During that time, he also said the alligator \"momentarily released\" his wife before biting her again on the shoulder.\n\nAfter regaining his balance, he tried once again to free his wife from the alligator's mouth, however the alligator then \"conducted a death roll and immediately swam away with Mrs. Diekema in its mouth.\"\n\nKnowing that time was of the essence, David — who lost his phone during the ordeal — bailed as much water as he could from the canoe and paddled north of Tiger Creek until he reached Lake Kissimmee, per the report. There he was rescued by a good Samaritan in an airboat.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into their search, the FWC recovered Cynthia's body and EMS pronounced her dead at the scene. The alligator was captured and euthanized around 7:30 p.m. local time that same day.\n\nA coroner later performed an autopsy and shared their findings with the FWC, detailing numerous injuries, including the amputation of her right arm below the shoulder.\n\nThey stated that the preliminary cause of Cynthia’s death was “multiple blunt force injuries from an alligator” and the manner of death was ruled as an “accident,\" according to the report.\n\nThe day after the incident, investigators returned to the scene to find any other alligators that were involved in the attack and to capture those that are potentially dangerous in the Tiger Creek area. One alligator was dispatched by an officer and moved onto an airboat bound for Kissimmee Park. No other gators were located.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“The FWC extends its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the victim during this difficult time,” the department said in a previous statement.\n\nCynthia was from Paw Paw, Mich., and is survived by her husband David, two children and two grandchildren, per her obituary.\n\n\"She radiated her inner and outer beauty in all she did and had unconditional love for everyone,\" the obituary read. \"She cherished her family and every moment and adventure they spent together.\"",

    "description": "Donald Trump reportedly ordered his motorcade to stop at a Florida strip mall Friday morning so he could purchase supplies for his White House ballroom.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reportedly ordered his motorcade to stop at a Florida strip mall Friday morning so he could purchase supplies for his $400 million White House ballroom.\n\nWhite House pool reports said the presidential motorcade “arrived at a shopping center in Lake Worth, Florida at 9:46 AM” so Trump could go “shopping at Arc Stone & Tile,” an importer of Italian marble.\n\nWhen pressed, a White House official said that the president “is purchasing lake and onyx, at his own expense, for the White House ballroom.”\n\nAlthough he may pay for the materials himself, conservative publication The New Republic pointed out that the president was shopping for his construction project “on the taxpayer’s dime.”\n\n“Trump has brought his longtime obsession with marble to his second term, pushing for it to appear just about everywhere,” TNR reported, noting that Trump “redid the bathroom in the White House Lincoln Suite entirely in marble, and he has proposed marble armrests for the Kennedy Center, claiming it would be ‘unlike anything ever done or seen before!'”\n\nTrump proudly shared photos of the Lincoln bathroom’s marble makeover replete with gold fixtures, writing on Truth Social in October that the “art deco green tile style” used in the 1940s “was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era.”\n\n“I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble,” Trump continued. “This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n\nTrump’s ballroom construction program came under fire immediately after he began tearing down the entire East Wing of the White House. The president initially said the ballroom would cost around $200 million, before revising it to $400 million. Trump has said the ballroom is completely privately funded.\n\nTrump has been staying at his private Florida club at Mar-a-Lago for New Year’s Eve celebrations. He also met there with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe post Trump’s Motorcade Reportedly Stops At a ‘Random’ FL Strip Mall So He Could Buy Marble For His Ballroom Project first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Florida is targeting the top cornerback in the transfer portal, Jontez Williams, and will host him on a visit next week.",
    "fullText": "Cornerback Jontez Williams, the top player at his position in the 2026 transfer cycle, will visit with the Florida Gators on Thursday, Jan. 8, according to On3's Hayes Fawcett.\n\nBoth Gators Online and Swamp247 have confirmed the report. The former Iowa State Cyclone is also set to visit Notre Dame (Jan. 5-6) and USC (Jan. 3). Penn State remains a possibility as well, should Williams desire to follow his former head coach, Matt Campbell, to Happy Valley.\n\nA Florida native, Williams grew up playing high school ball 40 minutes away from the University of Florida at Bradford High in Starke.\n\n247Sports ranks him No. 34 overall and No. 1 among cornerbacks in the 2026 transfer portal cycle, while On3 has him at No. 14 and No. 1, respectively.\n\nA three-star recruit out of high school, according to 247sports and Rivals, Williams spent his first two seasons at Iowa State developing into an all-conference defensive back. He redshirted in 2022 after seeing no action and played in 13 games (two starts) in 2023. He finished his redshirt freshman year with six tackles (two solo) and three pass breakups.\n\nThe 2024 campaign saw Williams break out, starting 12 of 14 games for the Cyclones. He finished sixth on the team with 46 tackles (nine solo) and was tied for third in the Big 12 with four interceptions. He also recorded nine pass deflections and two tackles for a loss. He was named to the All-Big 12 Second Team by the coaches that year.\n\nWilliams' 2025 season was cut short after five games due to a torn ACL in his right knee. He ended the year with 15 tackles and one interception.\n\nThe Orange and Blue are losing Devin Moore to graduation and both Jamroc Grimsley and Teddy Foster to the transfer portal, leaving seven cornerbacks on the roster.\n\nRising juniors Dijon Johnson and Cormani McClain are the most veteran returners and are expected to start, followed by rising sophomore J'Vari Flowers and rising redshirt freshmen Ben Hanks III and Onis Konanbanny. Florida added a pair of four-star recruits, CJ Bronaugh and CJ Hester, during the early signing period.\n\nWilliams would likely step in as the top player in the position room, should he choose Florida.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida football hosting transfer CB Jontez Williams on visit",

'cause TMZ has learned Franky Venegas was arrested again in Florida for alleged drug-related offenses and is currently behind bars.\n\nLaw enforcement tells us Franky was booked into the Collier County Jail in Naples Wednesday night on one count of drug paraphernalia, posing for a fresh mug shot ... face tattoos and all.\n\nWe're told Franky has no bond, as he's being held on a 24-hour hold because he's already out on bond from a February arrest for delivering/possessing/selling a firearm with an altered serial number.\n\nWe broke the story ... Franky was arrested in February on drug and firearm charges. The drug count was dropped, but the firearm charge stuck, and that's the case he's currently out on bond for.\n\nAccording to the February sheriff's report, officers stopped a yellow Corvette after it allegedly ran a stop sign. Cops say a baggie of suspected Oxycodone was found on the passenger side floorboard. Venegas denied ownership, claiming he had a prescription he didn't have with him.\n\nAt the time, police also found a brown \"MGM\" handbag containing a blue spray painted handgun with no serial numbers, a cut straw, and credit cards in Venegas' name. Another straw with a white powdery substance was allegedly found in the center console.\n\nFranky rose to fame in 2021 with brother Alex after their viral hit, \"I'm an Island Boy.\"\n\nHe's previously been arrested for domestic battery, reckless driving, and driving without a license.",

    "description": "As a Florida resident of over 25 years, I think there are several tourist spots worth visiting. However, others aren't quite worth the trip.",
    "fullText": "World-famous theme parks, stunning beaches, and natural beauty are just a few of the many reasons tourists flock to Florida every year.\n\nAfter living in the Sunshine State for over 25 years, I've explored just about every major tourist spot there is. In my experience, some absolutely live up to the hype, but others aren't worth your time or money.\n\nHere are the six tourist attractions worth visiting and the two you might want to skip on your next trip to Florida.\n\nA vibrant city with an artsy, laid-back vibe, St. Petersburg is a cultural hot spot on Florida's Gulf Coast. The downtown area is filled with colorful murals, markets, and great dining options.\n\nI recommend visiting the St. Pete Pier for beautiful waterfront views and great restaurants. Plan on arriving in the late afternoon to catch the stunning sunset.\n\nWhether you're a lifelong fan or new to the magic of the Harry Potter universe, the level of immersion in the Universal Orlando parks is unlike anything else I've ever experienced.\n\nSplit between Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida and Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure, the attractions bring this magical world to life with incredible detail.\n\nFrom sipping Butterbeer to riding Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, there's magic at every turn. The Hogwarts Express connects both lands, making park-to-park tickets a must for the full experience.\n\nA hidden gem located about 70 miles west of Key West, Dry Tortugas National Park is one of Florida's most remote and stunning destinations.\n\nIt's home to Fort Jefferson, a 19th-century coastal fort surrounded by crystal-clear waters that are perfect for snorkeling.\n\nThe park is only accessible by ferry or seaplane, making it a true off-the-grid getaway. I recommend booking a ride on the Yankee Freedom III ferry or a spot on a seaplane tour well in advance, as space fills up quickly.\n\nWynwood Walls in Miami is a vibrant outdoor street-art museum that provides an explosion of color and creativity.\n\nLocated in Miami's artsy Wynwood neighborhood, the area features massive, changing murals created by artists from around the world.\n\nBeyond the walls, you can find art galleries, shops, and some of Miami's trendiest restaurants.\n\nI suggest grabbing a drink at Panther Coffee or stopping for dinner at Bakan, known for its unique and authentic Mexican cuisine — some of which feature insects.\n\nThe Everglades are more than just a swamp — they're a massive, incredibly diverse ecosystem home to alligators, manatees, and stunning bird species.\n\nI recommend visiting Everglades National Park for an airboat tour. For a quieter experience, you can also get out on a kayak to explore the park up close.\n\nThe Florida panhandle's beaches, including Pensacola, Santa Rosa Beach, and the scenic 30A stretch, have some of the softest, whitest sand I've ever seen.\n\nThis area is perfect for those looking for a mix of relaxation and outdoor fun.\n\nDestin, which is home to clear emerald waters, is one of our family's favorite destinations. I recommend visiting in late spring or early fall to enjoy the warm weather without the summer crowds.\n\nInternational Drive is a shopping and entertainment area in downtown Orlando. Although it's home to a few decent spots like Icon Park and the Orlando Premium Outlets, a lot of I-Drive feels like a tourist trap.\n\nIf you're in Orlando, I recommend heading to Disney Springs instead for shopping, dining, and entertainment. You'll get a taste of Disney magic without needing a park ticket.\n\nSouth Beach is an iconic area in Miami, but unless you're there to party, it can be more of a headache than a highlight. In my experience, the food and drinks are pricey, the beaches are crowded, and parking can be difficult.\n\nI think there are better beaches and neighborhoods in Miami that offer a more enjoyable experience (especially if you're traveling with family or kids).\n\nFor example, I recommend checking out Crandon Park Beach for a more peaceful and scenic Miami experience.\n\nThis story was originally published on April 22, 2025, and most recently updated on December 31, 2025.",

    "description": "There are still over 500,000 tires left in the reef.",
    "fullText": "The Osborne Reef is an artificial reef project situated off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It was one of many attempts in the 1970s and 80s to mimic the environmental benefits of coral reefs using old tires, but it has become an environmental disaster.\n\nIn the years since, several groups — including the U.S. military — have attempted to clean it up.\n\nIn the 1970s, a local nonprofit created the Osborne Reef by dropping more than two million tires into Florida's coastal waters in an attempt to create an environment where marine life would thrive.\n\nThe project generated a lot of buzz. It was approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the dumping operation was supervised by a U.S. Navy minesweeper. Goodyear, which provided many of the tires, even christened the reef by dropping a gold-plated tire into the ocean from the Goodyear Blimp.\n\nIn the years to follow, many of the tires — which were held together only with nylon rope and steel clips — came loose, making the \"reef\" useless as a habitat and, in some cases, damaging real coral reefs nearby.\n\nOver the past two decades, groups both public and private have launched programs to remove the remaining Osborne Reef tires from the ocean.\n\nNow, the company 4ocean is making the Osborne Reef cleanup one of its core missions.\n\n\"Ultimately, the well-intentioned project failed,\" 4ocean wrote in an Instagram post sharing eerie photos of the reef. \"And now 4ocean is stepping in to clean them up!\"\n\n\"This operation is an uphill battle,\" the organization continued. \"While there's been much cleanup progress since the first photo was captured, there's still over 500,000 tires left sitting at the bottom of the ocean. We definitely have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nTo fund its cleanup efforts, 4ocean is even selling jewelry made from tires pulled from the seafloor.\n\nThe Florida Department of Environmental Protection continues to monitor the situation as well, through its Osborne Reef Waste Tire Removal Project.\n\nBut cleanup efforts are still slow-going. The state estimated that there were 650,000 tires remaining in 2016, and 4ocean estimates that there were still over 500,000 as of 2022. In May 2023, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed off on an assessment from the Department of Environmental Protection to detail the condition of the reef, as reported by Florida Politics. That report, which would include an estimated timeline for the completion of the cleanup, is due by July 2024.\n\n4ocean's sustainable, circular model of selling products made from salvaged debris in order to fund further cleanup efforts could provide a blueprint for the treatment of other failed artificial reefs, from Malaysia to France.\n\nThe company notes that many of the tires it finds are beyond any recycling use, but it takes those tires to Florida's Solid Waste Authority, \"one of the most advanced, efficient, and [low-pollution] waste management facilities in the United States.\"\n\nAccording to its website, 4ocean's ultimate goal \"is to partner with organizations that can help us recycle these scrap tires on a massive scale so we can use more of this material to create new products that fund this historic cleanup operation and advance our mission to end the ocean plastic crisis.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and cool tips that make it easy to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "fullText": "Along with the sudden shutdowns of commercial airlines including Play and Blue Islands, a number of charter and fractional carriers also filed for bankruptcy in 2025.\n\nFlorida-based Verijet and Montana charter carrier Corporate Air both initiated bankruptcy proceedings at the same time in October, while Alaska-based Kenai Aviation followed just a few weeks later with a total shutdown of operations in November.\n\nThe charter airline connected hubs like Anchorage and Fairbanks with smaller communities in Kenai, Homer, and Seward.\n\n\"We need capital, we need partners, we need a lifeline,\" owner Joel Caldwell wrote in November. \"That investor is out there, we just need to find them.\"\n\nThe latest airline to submit a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing is Greensboro-based Jet It. Although the carrier once running charter and fractional flights has not operated since shutting down all operations in 2023, the Dec. 24 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware is a final step in a story that ultimately ends in liquidation.\n\nContrary to a Chapter 11 filing with intent to restructure, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy asks a judge to skip that step and go straight to liquidation. The filing shows that the airline, which launched in 2022 by selling fractional ownership to HondaJet flights, ran up more than $36.2 million in liabilities, including $9.7 million in unsecured claims.\n\nA fractional airline operates by selling shares to a private jet. These are doled out by giving customers a set number of hours they can use to request flights run by the airline's crew.\n\nAt the time it launched, Jet It advertised rates of $1,600 an hour while operating more than 18,000 flight hours a year. Despite the airline once being the 12th-largest private jet operator in the U.S., Jet It also ran up significant debts, given the high cost of jet fuel and a customer base that petered out over time.\n\nThe largest creditor remains World Fuel Services, to which Jet It owes $735,695, according to the filing. American Express is owed over $600,000, while smaller creditors include PIC Card Services LLC and Jetex Flight Services.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway unit FlightSafety claims it was never paid $400,981 for pilot training services enlisted by the airline.\n\nMajor airline launches surprising flight between Las Vegas and Paris\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nThe highest rooftop in Barcelona is in a surprising place\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "fullText": "MIAMI (AP) — U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick reiterated her innocence Monday outside a Miami federal courthouse, where she faces charges of conspiring to steal $5 million in federal COVID-19 disaster funds.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick was scheduled to be arraigned, but her attorney requested the proceeding be rescheduled to Jan. 20 so that she could finalize her legal team. Prosecutors didn't object, and Judge Lisette Reid agreed to the new date. The hearing lasted less than five minutes.\n\n“I just want to make it very clear that I am innocent,” Cherfilus-McCormick said immediately after leaving court. “In no way did I steal any kind of funds. I'm committed to the people of Florida and my district.”\n\nCherfilus-McCormick, a Democrat, has pleaded not guilty. She is facing 15 federal counts that accuse her of stealing funds that had been overpaid to her family's health care company, Trinity Healthcare Services, in 2021. The company had a contract to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick's attorney, David Oscar Markus, said the case involves mistakes that generally aren't even misdemeanors, let alone felonies. He said he believes the case is politically motivated.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick was arrested in November and then freed on a $60,000 bond. In addition to bail, the judge said Cherfilus-McCormick must surrender her personal passport, and is allowed to travel only between Florida, Washington, D.C., Maryland and the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nShe has been allowed to retain her congressional passport so she can perform certain duties for her job.\n\nAccording to the federal indictment, prosecutors said that within two months of receiving the funds in 2021, more than $100,000 had been spent on a 3-carat yellow diamond ring for the congresswoman.\n\nThe health care company owned by Cherfilus-McCormick's family had received payments through a COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract, the indictment said. Her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, requested $50,000, but they mistakenly received $5 million and didn't return the difference.\n\nProsecutors said the funds received by Trinity Healthcare were distributed to various accounts, including to friends and relatives who then donated to Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign for Congress.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick won a special election in January 2022 to represent Florida’s 20th District, which includes parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021.\n\nThe charges she faces include theft of government funds; making and receiving straw donor contributions; aiding and assisting a false and fraudulent statement on a tax return; money laundering, as well as conspiracy charges associated with each of those counts.\n\nAccording to a previous statement provided by Cherfilus-McCormick's chief of staff, she doesn't plan to resign from office. She said she has cooperated with “every lawful request” and will continue to do so until the matter is resolved.",

    "title": "Florida Supreme Court Allows $165,000 Fine Against Homeowner for Parking in Her Driveway to Stand",
    "description": "The owner of the house and her family have four cars, so they spill slightly onto the lawn when parked—which is where the town takes issue.",
    "fullText": "Parking in a driveway is about as mundane as parking can get. It's not as fancy as in a garage. It's not as potentially dangerous as parking on a street. And yet, in this story, it's led to a six-figure fine that the Florida Supreme Court has decided to let stand after several years of litigation.\n\nWhile the state's Supreme Court didn't endorse the fine, according to CBS News, it declined to review the case of Sandy Martinez, a single mother who has spent several years fighting fines that have now ballooned to $165,000 and counting. Over $100,000 of those fines relate directly to Ms. Martinez parking her cars on her driveway and slightly onto her grass. Her home isn't home to her alone; her son, daughter, and sister all live with her. All four of them have full-time jobs, and each of them has their own car. The house itself is on a corner lot, so street parking isn't available. As such, they line their cars up across the four-car driveway.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the four cars always ends up having to park slightly onto the grass in the yard that Martinez owns. According to the city of Lantana, that's unacceptable, and as a result it has fined her $250 a day for over a year.\n\nThe Institute for Justice has stepped in, and is representing Martinez. “Six-figure fines for parking on your own property are shocking,” IJ senior attorney Ari Bargil told CBS News, following the court’s decision not to take up the case. “The court’s refusal to hear Sandy’s case is a disservice to all Floridians.”\n\nFor Martinez, options moving forward are extremely limited. CBS News says Florida's Homestead Protection Act shields her from foreclosure, but it's destroyed the equity she'd built up in her home. She can't retry the case in Florida either, and given the Supreme Court's ruling, it's unlikely that a federal court would hear the case.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States is offering Ukraine security guarantees for a period of 15 years as part of a proposed peace plan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, though he said he would prefer an American commitment of up to 50 years to deter Russia from further attempts to seize its neighbor’s land by force.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump hosted Zelenskyy at his Florida resort on Sunday and insisted that Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace settlement.\n\nNegotiators are still searching for a breakthrough on key issues, however, including whose forces withdraw from where and the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the 10 biggest in the world. Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.\n\n“Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,” Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.\n\nUkraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDetails of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the “presence” of partners. He didn’t elaborate, but Russia has said it won’t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv’s allies will meet in Paris in early January to “finalize each country’s concrete contributions” to the security guarantees.\n\nTrump said he would consider extending U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.\n\nHowever, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

Welcome to the transfer portal.\n\nDJ Lagway is departing from Florida after two seasons as the starter, so the Gators need a new guy.\n\nThere are plenty of options available in the portal, but there's one hint as to where Florida might go.\n\nThe Athletic's Manny Navarro thinks Aaron Philo from Georgia Tech will start at QB for the Gators in 2026.\n\n\"Former Tulane coach Jon Sumrall hired Buster Faulkner away from Georgia Tech to be Florida’s new offensive coordinator, and it seems inevitable Philo will follow him to Gainesville,\" Navarro writes.\n\nMORE: Dylan Raiola predicted to end up in the ACC\n\nPhilo has been the backup at Georgia Tech behind superstar Haynes King.\n\nIn two seasons of college football so far, Philo has appeared in eight games. He has completed 57.8% of his passes for 938 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\nPhilo has also run 16 times for 95 yards (5.9 ypc) and a touchdown.\n\nIt'd be a big gamble for Florida to count on Philo as its starting QB next season, but with so many possible destinations, maybe that familiarity with the offensive coordinator will be enough to make this partnership happen.\n\nFlorida State linked to Sun Belt's best player\n\nMiami's next transfer QB predicted to come from out west\n\nNotre Dame transfer QB could be coming to the ACC\n\nJames Franklin has chance to land former Penn State QB for Hokies\n\nIvy League QB could wind up in Big Ten\n\nOregon lined up with prolific QB transfer",

    "description": "I moved across the world for my husband and ended up a single mom. Years later, I met the love of my life when I least expected it.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-one years ago, I faced the difficult decision to move from Spain to the United States with my 3-year-old daughter and 4-month-old baby to follow my then-husband, who had lost his job, in pursuit of a new position in Florida.\n\nI was being asked to leave behind my family, friends, and an established writing career. I was to start over at 41, with no connections, no guarantees, and an already shaky marriage.\n\nMy family thought it was a terrible idea, yet my husband's family felt it was a great opportunity. So, after some soul-searching and many promises of a better life in Florida, I decided to uproot my kids and take the chance.\n\nAs I boarded the plane to meet my children's father (he had come to the US ahead of us), I had mixed feelings: I could feel the excitement of my eldest to see her dad again, but I also feared the unknown. I kept asking myself whether it was really possible that we could fix our marriage and thrive in a different country.\n\nGoing from living in a penthouse in the old part of Sevilla, where I could walk to just about everywhere, to being cooped up in a tiny apartment in a gated community in suburban Florida, where I needed a car to go anywhere, was brutal to my nervous system.\n\nI felt trapped in suburbia without my own car. And with a history of major depressive disorder, I started having panic attacks and depressive episodes. One day, while driving my children to find a preschool for my eldest, I had to pull over to sob.\n\nA few months later, my husband lost the job we had moved to Florida for. And so began one of the most difficult periods of our lives.\n\nIn four years, we moved several times within Florida, always because of his new jobs. I found work freelancing for newspapers and magazines and wrote more books for publishers in Spain. But our relationship was always floundering.\n\nAs our marriage crumbled, we took a time-out under the same roof. We went to marriage counseling, enrolled in self-improvement seminars, and so on. Trust, respect, and admiration had been completely lost, and in 2008, when the Great Recession hit, we had no money, no savings, and no jobs.\n\nI walked away from my husband with my laptop, my books, joint custody of our children, and the huge regret of having moved so far away from my family and friends. But I stayed in Florida, because I didn't want my children to be far from their father. From one day to the next, I found myself a single mother on food stamps.\n\nNearly a year after separating, 16 years ago, I met the love of my life. We had many similarities: we were both newly single, bilingual and bicultural, and had children of a similar age. We were writers focused on creating a better life for our kids and ourselves. The best part was that neither of us had given up on love despite the tough times we'd lived through.\n\nFor nearly two years, we dated long-distance, spending only weekends and holidays together. One of us would drive two hours to meet the other, sometimes with the children, and when the kids were with our respective former spouses, we met alone.\n\nWe were both trying to rebuild ourselves personally and professionally, and together we made a great team. I once again moved for love, but this time with no regrets. Four years later, we married at sunset on the beach, surrounded by our children and close family.\n\nOur kids are all in their 20s now, and we've been through the highest highs as well as some pretty rough times. But our relationship was never in question. We've cheered each other on and thrived together.\n\nWhenever I think of past regrets and how I shouldn't have moved to the US 21 years ago with my ex, I realize I would have missed out on finding true love. And I would never have built the stable and dependable family I always wanted.",

    "fullText": "Despite a three-game win streak going into the Christmas break, the Florida Gators continue to drop in the ESPN College Basketball Power Index.\n\nLast ranked No. 11 following a win over George Washington, Florida fell one spot to No. 12 after decisive wins over Saint Francis and Colgate — both considered Quadrant 4 matchups by the NET rankings.\n\nThe Gators have a 19.0 overall BPI, up from 18.5 on Dec. 16. The offense improved to 8.8 (20th) from 8.0 (24th), while the Florida defense dipped to 10.2 (T-10th) from 10.3 (8th) in that time. ESPN projects Florida to go 21.5-9.5 overall — a 0.5-game increase — and 12.5-5.5 in conference play, a 0.4-game improvement.\n\n“The College Basketball Power Index (BPI) is a measure of team strength that is meant to be the best predictor of performance going forward,” ESPN explains. “BPI represents how many points above or below average a team is. Strength of Record (SOR) is a measure of team accomplishment based on how difficult a team’s W-L record is to achieve. Game predictions account for opponent strength, pace of play, site, travel distance, day’s rest and altitude, and are used to simulate the season 10,000 times to produce season projections.”\n\nFlorida remains the favorite to win the SEC, with 41% odds — up from 38.2% chance last week. The Vanderbilt Commodores (29%) and Tennessee Volunteers (21.3%) have the next best odds to win the conference, followed by Alabama Crimson Tide (15%) and Kentucky (14%). No other SEC team has better than a 4.4% chance to win the conference.\n\nFlorida's remaining strength of schedule is now 24th in the country, up from 44th before a three-game stretch against Quadrant 4 opponents. Florida still has Dartmouth on the schedule, and then it's all SEC from there. The Gators' strength of schedule (to date) ranks fifth in the country, while the non-conference slate ranks sixth nationally.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida Gators basketball ESPN BPI rankings Dec. 26",

    "description": "Steven Carroll and his son spent weekends flying JetBlue for a challenge that once sent them from New York to DC to Florida and back all in one day.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Steve Carroll, a New York-based nurse practitioner who chased JetBlue's \"25 for 25\" challenge to earn 350,000 points and Mosaic status for 25 years by flying to 25 unique cities by December 31. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBreakfast in Massachusetts, lunch in DC, dinner in Orlando, and back home by midnight. That was one of the epic days that my 10-year-old son and I flew for JetBlue Airways' \"25 for 25\" challenge.\n\nIt was thrilling to plan and execute these trips, with layovers so tight we sometimes barely had time for a bathroom break. Finding a flourishing community chasing this challenge was one of the best parts.\n\nThe promotion, created for JetBlue's 25th anniversary, is simple: Fly to 25 unique cities in the airline's network between June 25 and December 31, and you'll earn Mosaic 1 status for 25 years plus a lump sum of 350,000 points.\n\nThere are some rules: You must connect your loyalty number to each flight; basic fares don't qualify; flights must be operated by JetBlue (not its partners, such as Cape Air); and only arrival airports count.\n\nStill, I realized it could be an unforgettable experience for my son Jackson and I. He already loves JetBlue (I think the TV screens do it for him), and his 100th and 200th flights ever were on JetBlue.\n\nPlus, Mosaic status until age 35 means he and his friends could enjoy the perks — like free bags, complimentary drinks, dedicated security and check-in, early boarding, and seat upgrades — on future spring break or summer trips in college. (Editor's note: You must be a Mosaic  3 member or higher to receive complimentary Mint upgrades and a Mosaic 4 for lounge access when JetBlue's open in late 2025.)\n\nThe math also checked out. Completing the challenge earned each of us a reward of 350,000 points, at least $3,500 in travel apiece, plus the additional points earned from our flights.\n\nCombining the cash I paid plus the 100,000 JetBlue points I already had, the whole challenge cost around $7,000, but I was essentially reimbursed in points.\n\nI started the challenge already holding Mosaic, but securing long-term status now gives me more freedom to put everyday spending on other cards and build points with brands like Hyatt via Chase.\n\nJetBlue's new partnership with United Airlines also means I can tap into reciprocal benefits on United — an attractive perk since we live close to the airline's Newark, New Jersey, base.\n\nTo maximize our time, we mostly flew on weekends and sometimes took up to five flights across a Saturday or Sunday. We took closer to 35 flights overall because of the overlap at some departure and connecting airports.\n\nOur flights stretched west to Los Angeles, north to Portland, Maine, and south to Fort Lauderdale. We've also checked off airports like Cleveland, Norfolk, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Manchester in New Hampshire, Raleigh in North Carolina, and Buffalo in New York.\n\nOur most ambitious weekend was over Veterans Day in November, when we planned 18 flights and 11 new cities. The government shutdown, however, canceled five of them, but we managed to rebook and still add several new destinations.\n\nAside from those cancellations and a huge delay that forced us to postpone a trip, the challenge has been remarkably smooth. And we've met a great community of people also clamoring for 25 years of Mosaic status.\n\nWe recently flew in Mint business class to Los Angeles as our 23rd city and completed the challenge on December 8 in Fort Myers, with about three weeks to spare.\n\nI already had a few JetBlue trips on my calendar to start, but then I created a master list of airports in the Northeast along with their city pairs. I live just north of New York City.\n\nThe goal was to create snaking routes that efficiently hopscotch across the US; we're trying to avoid international flying. I'd sit up in bed when I couldn't sleep and just map out my options.\n\nOver time, I've figured out a few tricks: book one-ways, sit near the front, and choose the first and last flights of the day. Most fares averaged about $100 per person.\n\nI have lounge access that made longer layovers easier, though I occasionally booked \"illegal\" itineraries with very tight connections. Connecting airports, regardless of the time spent there, count as unique destinations.\n\nBut before I risked it, I checked the historical arrival times. One trip I planned included a 12-minute layover at New York-JFK, but we still made it because our flight from Hyannis, Massachusetts, landed half an hour early, as expected.\n\nWeather-tracking helped, too. I adjusted my flight if I anticipated a disruption, which my status allows me to do for free. An unofficial tool called \"25for25.ai\" was also helpful; you can plug in your starting point and block destinations you've already hit.\n\nLiving in the New York area made the challenge far more doable. Airports, like White Plains, LaGuardia, Newark, New York-JFK, and Islip on Long Island, are all considered separate, unique cities.\n\nNew York-JFK and Newark are especially useful since they offer so many connections. There's also Hartford, Connecticut, and Philadelphia nearby. That's seven of the 25 we just drove to.\n\nSmaller airports like Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts require more creativity because they offer limited frequencies.\n\nOne of our biggest travel days began in White Plains, New York, where we flew to Nantucket and had breakfast in town. We then headed to DC for lunch at the airport, and finally to Orlando for dinner, also at the airport.\n\nMy partner joined us on that trip, making it a family day in the skies. We crossed paths with about 15 other challengers on our legs to DC.\n\nWhat was extremely helpful was the dedicated Mosaic Facebook group, where other participants in the challenge shared routes and road warrior stories. It's not hosted by JetBlue.\n\nThe challenge fostered a vibrant and supportive community. (Editor's note: JetBlue told Business Insider that over 500 people have completed the promotion so far.)\n\nMy son and I sometimes saw other challengers on our flights and ate lunch together in the airport between legs. We helped a family of four explore the town during our layover in Nantucket.\n\nWe exchanged numbers with almost every person we met so we can stay in touch. I didn't expect to find such a large and enthusiastic community, but it was one of the best parts of the challenge.\n\nI have a little tag on my bag that somebody made for me that says 'JetBlue 25 for 25.' When people saw it, they were like, 'Oh, you're doing the challenge.'\n\nIt was nice getting help along the way, and I appreciate being able to help others, too, as we cheered them on to finish by the holidays.",

    "fullText": "A Florida man is suing a major steakhouse chain after one of the restaurant’s toilets “shattered” while he was using it.\n\nMichael Green said in a lawsuit that the incident unfolded during a visit to an Outback Steakhouse in Ocala on March 26.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed by law firm Dan Newlin Injury Attorneys, alleges that Green left his table to use a handicapped stall during his meal. That was when the seat collapsed beneath him, causing him to fall to the ground.\n\nGreen’s lawsuit, which was seen by Ocala News, claims that he suffered “significant and permanent loss of an important bodily function and/or permanent and significant scarring” as a result of his injuries.\n\nNow, he is suing the Australian-themed chain of steakhouses for damages in excess of $50,000. He has also accused the company of negligence on the basis that it failed to “ensure the toilet was secured to the floor.”\n\nOutback Steakhouse has more than 1,000 locations across the world, 670 of which are in the United States, according to its quarterly report.\n\nFounded in 1988, the Tampa-based company is known for its “bloomin’ onions.” The deep-fried dish consists of an onion cut to resemble a flower and is often served with the brand’s dipping sauce.\n\nHowever, like many restaurant chains, the brand has been forced to close several of its locations as part of a “turnaround plan.”\n\nTwo of the sites that have closed are based in Alabama, with another two being located in Florida. Locations in Maryland, Louisiana, New York and Wisconsin were also closed as part of the plan.\n\nOutback Steakhouse is operated by parent company Bloomin’ Brands which confirmed the news in a statement given to USA Today.\n\n\"We considered a variety of factors, including sales and traffic, trade areas, and potential investments to improve performance,\" Elizabeth Daly, the company’s spokesperson, wrote.\n\nThe wave of closures comes just months after 41 “underperforming” restaurants were shuttered by Bloomin’ Brands in February.\n\nEmployees at the axed locations were offered jobs at nearby restaurants if possible.\n\n“Closing restaurants is never easy,\" Bloomin' Brands said in a statement at the time. \"This was a business decision that has no reflection on the staff or their service.\n\n“Many team members will have the opportunity to transfer to open positions at another restaurant,” the statement continued. “Employees who do not will receive severance.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted Bloomin’ Brands and Dan Newlin Injury Attorneys.",

Responding deputies found Crystal Kenney dead and a 13-year-old girl who had been shot in the shoulder and face.\n\nShe is recovering in a hospital.\n\n\"She said, ‘I begged him, don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me, and he shot me anyway,’\" Judd said.\n\nArkansas Mom Found Shot To Death With Two Children Wrote Cryptic Facebook Post Months Before Killings\n\nThe boy was unharmed, as was Jason and Crystal’s 1-year-old daughter, who was home at the time of the shooting. She was found by deputies asleep in her crib.\n\nAfter the shooting, Jason Kenney fled and called his sister, who lives in upstate New York, Judd said. He told her he had \"done something\" wrong and that it would be the last time they would talk.\n\nHe then drove to his father’s home, where deputies found him. As deputies attempted to get him out of a shed, Jason fatally shot himself, Judd said.\n\nDuring a search of the family’s home, deputies found a note Crystal wrote to her husband urging him to get help.\n\n\"You’re drinking, you’re using cocaine again. This is not the way the family should be. You need God,\" the note states, Judd said.\n\nThe surviving children are in the custody of grandparents.\n\n\"The entire family was destroyed,\" Judd said. \"Our homicide detectives are distraught.

    "description": "Everyone knows that the LSU Tigers are going to be in the market for a quarterback this offseason, the only question is which one.",
    "fullText": "Everyone knows that the LSU Tigers are going to be in the market for a quarterback this offseason, the only question is which one.\n\nMatt Mascona, of LouisianaSports.net, reported that the Tigers have made contact with the reps of former Florida Gators star DJ Lagway. That immediately solidifies Lagway’s position on the list of possibilities for next year.\n\nLane Kiffin and his staff must come away with a new option at quarterback next year. The only scholarship player at the position on the roster is Michael Van Buren Jr.\n\nWhile Van Buren showed flashes over the last few weeks when he took over for Garrett Nussmeier, but not enough to warrant going into next season with him as the only option.\n\nKiffin is likely to go big game hunting for one of the top names available.\n\nThe most obvious observation to make is bringing over Trinidad Chambliss from the Ole Miss Rebels, but he’s not guaranteed another year of eligibility.\n\nArizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt was another top option, coming off a down year but still carrying hopes of having an NFL career. Working with Kiffin could secure that.\n\nIf it does come down to Lagway as the choice, it would be an exciting outcome for LSU. He may not have had the best start to his career with the Gators, but he’s still a high potential player.\n\nLagway was the top high school passer in a class that included stars like Julian Sayin, Dylan Raiola and CJ Carr. He’s now one of the top options in the portal.\n\nThe Texas native has completed 63.2% of his passes for 4,179 yards with 28 touchdowns and 23 interceptions over his two seasons in Florida.\n\nHe’ll have great games and make impressive throws, but no consistency has been developed. It wouldn’t be crazy to think that Kiffin and his staff could unlock something that the failed Gators crew couldn’t.",

    "fullText": "The future of high school football is here, and it’s burning bright. From California to Florida, Texas to Pennsylvania, gridiron stars have performed all across the country the past few months to electrify on Friday nights. We’re unveiling our Sophomore All-American list – the names you need to know now, because you’ll be hearing about them all throughout the off-season and into 2026. These athletes aren’t just talented; they’re the game-changers from this past 2025 high school football campaign.\n\nQB: Lukas Prock, Hun School\nWe’d be hard pressed to not have Prock heading up this list as the country’s top quarterback when you look at production, talent and competition he faced in 2025. The 6-foot-2, 180-pound quarterback went up against the likes of teams in Archbishop Spalding (Md.), The St. James Academy (Md.), St. Frances Academy (Md.), The First Academy and IMG Academy. The signal caller finished the season completing 226 of 309 passes for 4,330 yards and 41 touchdowns.\n\nRB: Xander Edwards, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nEdwards had himself a breakout season playing for the FHSAA Class 2A state semifinalist Bolles bulldogs. The sophomore running back averaged a ridiculous 9.9 yards per carry and rushed for 2,629 and scored 44 times on the ground. Add in his 17 catches for 211 yards and Edwards finishes just shy of 3,000 all-purpose yards for the 2025 season.\n\nRB: Zaiden Jernigan, Louisville (MS)\nJernigan made his name well known throughout the Magnolia State this past 2025 season as the running back put up some of the top numbers of any back in the country when it came to sophomores. The running back rushed for 1,563 yards on 238 carries and scored 20 touchdowns. The sophomore also added 205 yards and four touchdowns out of the backfield.\n\nWR: Roye Oliver, Hamilton (Ariz.)\nOliver was as good as advertised anytime he took the field for Hamilton, finishing the season catching 92 passes for 1,839 yards and scoring 29 touchdowns. There’s little doubt that Oliver is one of the country’s best wide receivers, regardless of class as he proved himself this 2025 campaign.\n\nWR: Brysen Wright, Mandarin (Fla.)\nThe four-star do-everything has done it all just about for Mandarin this past season, with Wright catching 46 passes for 983 yards and 10 touchdowns. Wright has also seen plenty of time on the defensive side of the ball as well, notching 63 tackles and intercepting five passes. The sophomore also contributed in the punt return game, totaling 254 yards on six returns.\n\nWR: Eric McFarland, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nThough McFarland reclassified to the Class of 2027, he was considered a sophomore throughout the entire 2025 high school football season. McFarland has shown his versatility not only going downfield, but also on jet sweeps, pop passes and even just taking hand-offs. Through nine games, McFarland caught 29 passes for 595 yards and scored 11 touchdowns.\n\nOT: R’Monie Edwards, Cypress Ranch (TX)\nAt 6-foot-5, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle was near impossible to get by for opposing defensive ends down in the Lone Star State. Rated a four-star by the Rivals Industry Rankings, Edwards led the way up front for over 4,500 all-purpose yards, 58 touchdowns and 463 points scored in 2025.\n\nOL: Elisha Mueller, Servite (Calif.)\nPlaying up against some of the top high school football programs in the land, Mueller held his own and then some for the Friars. Mueller is interchangeable at either guard position and led the way for Servite’s offense that totaled over 3,500 all-purpose yards and 39 touchdowns.\n\nC: Hunter Hill, Peach County (Ga.)\nHill can play center or at either guard position as he did during the 2025 season for the 10-2 Peach County Trojans. The 6-foot-3, 305-pound interior offensive lineman was superb in Year 2 and helped the Trojans amass 4,500-plus yards of offense and scoring 58 total touchdowns.\n\nOL: George Selvie III, Sumner (Fla.)\nFamiliar with the name? That’s because his father, George Selvie, starred at USF and eventually in the NFL. Now the younger Selvie plays for his father at Sumner and has blossomed into one of the top offensive linemen in the country when it comes to sophomores. Selvie III paved the way for over 3,800 yards and 45 touchdowns for the Class 7A region finalist Stingrays.\n\nOT: Jamarios Canton, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nProtecting the right side of Jayden Wade on Friday nights, Canton proved anytime out on the field that he was the top offensive tackle of the 2028 class. At 6-foot-4, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle took on all comers and right out of the gates against Hoover (Ala.) was pancaking opposing defensive linemen.\n\nAll-Purpose: Gaige Weddle, Rancho Bernardo (Calif.)\nI mean, what didn’t Weddle do for Rancho Bernardo in 2025? The dual-threat quarterback threw for 2,224 yards and 19 touchdowns through the air. Weddle led the team in rushing with 679 yards on just 98 attempts and 10 scores. Oh and Weddle also led the team on defense with 101 tackles, two sacks and two interceptions. Like we said, what didn’t Weddle do? He was what you want in a all-purpose athlete.\n\nEdge: Asher Ghioto, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nNo matter where Ghioto lined up on the defensive line, the 6-foot-5, 240-pound EDGE rusher was causing havoc for opposing offensive linemen. Ghioto finished the season totaling 84 tackles, 35 for a loss and 23 sacks.\n\nDT: Kellan Hall, Christian Academy of Louisville (KY)\nAnchoring the Centurions’ defensive line all throughout their undefeated 15-0 run to the KHSAA Class 3A state championship. Hall recently received defensive first-team all-state honors playing on the defensive line. When it comes to interior defensive linemen, there’s very few as agile and quick like the 6-foot-4, 255-pound stalwart.\n\nDT: Cory Cunningham, Providence (N.C.)\nThe four-star 6-foot-4, 265-pound defensive tackle was a force in North Carolina’s Class 8A throughout the season. Cunningham was unblockable for many opposing offensive linemen as the defensive tackle racked up 60 tackles, 28 going for a loss and 15 quarterback takedowns.\n\nEdge: Jackson Vaughn, Bergen Catholic (N.J.)\nJust because the numbers might’ve went down a little from his freshman campaign doesn’t mean that Vaughn didn’t remain a factor when it came to EDGE rushers. Teams took notice and Vaughn faced plenty of double and even triple teams. The edge rusher compiled 40 tackles, 12 for a loss and eight sacks.\n\nOLB: Judah Blair, Lakota West (OH)\nBlair at 6-foot-1, 200 pounds moves like a safety, but can hit you like a ton of bricks like a linebacker. The sophomore backer had a strong year in the linebacking corps for Lakota West, tallying 57 tackles, 15.5 going for a loss, three sacks and an interception.\n\nLB: Tahj Gray, St. Joseph Regional (N.J.)\nThe sophomore linebacker proved himself on the highest level of of New Jersey high school football, helping the St. Joseph Regional Green Knights win the NJSIAA Non-Public A state championship. Gray last season ended with 102 total tackles, 10.5 for a loss, four sacks and four passes broken up.\n\nLB: Nehemiah McCary, Maplesville (Ala.)\nMcCrary was a two-way force for Maplesville this past season as the Red Devils went on to win Alabama’s Class 1A state championship. The 6-foot-2, 225-pound linebacker’s performance in the state title game came on the offensive end of the ball where McCrary rushed for 182 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nCB: A’mir Sears, West Broward (Fla.)\nOne of the biggest reasons why West Broward made it all the way to Florida’s Class 6A state championship game was the play of the four-star athlete. Sears was dynamic on both sides of the ball, with the sophomore making 61 tackles, breaking up 11 passes and intercepting three others. On offense, Sears led the Bobcats with 942 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nCB: Langston Pridgeon, Stone Bridge (Va.)\nMany opposing quarterbacks thought twice before throwing to Pridgeon’s side of the field in 2025. Ranked as one of the top cornerbacks in the country, Pridgeon proved himself to being one of Virginia’s best players in the Bulldogs’ defensive secondary. Whether its playing in man or zone coverages, the sophomore excelled in his sophomore campaign.\n\nS: Casey Barner, McEachern (Ga.)\nHonestly, Barner could’ve been put at a multitude of spots on this list but his natural position is at safety and there was little doubt of his talents from the moment he stepped onto the field this season. In McEachern’s season-opening win 50-17 win over Walton, Barner compiled 341 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns.\n\nS: Giovanni Tuggle, Winder-Barrow (Ga.)\nIt’s an all-Georgia safety duo with Tuggle paired with Barner in the first team defensive backfield. Tuggle saw extensive playing time for the Bulldogs this past 2025 season as the four-star safety totaled 74 tackles, five pass breakups and also intercepted four others.\n\nPK: Jack Ciancio, Phenix City Central (Ala.)\nThe sophomore kicker was automatic when it came to extra points for the Phenix City Red Devils this past season, knocking down all 75 of his attempts. Ciancio connected on 11 field goals, with a long of 38 yards.\n\nP: Israel Carmona, Queen Creek (Ariz.)\nPlacing punts inside of an opponent’s 20-yard line was a specialty of Carmona’s this past season as the sophomore pinned teams deep into their own territory 17 times. On 39 punt attempts, Carmona averaged 40.6 yards with a long of 58 on the season.\n\nReturn Specialist: Tyree Mannings, Venice (Fla.)\nMannings was superb stepping into the No. 1 receiver role at Venice after Winston Watkins Jr. graduated and had built a strong connection with Howard quarterback commit Darryon Jones. The Indians’ top wide receiver hauled in 84 passes for 1,429 yards and 12 touchdowns. Mannings was deadly in the kick return game, compiling 335 return yards for the Indians.\n\nQB: Koa Malau’ulu, St. John Bosco (Calif.)\nRB: Taihj Moore, Deland (Fla.)\nRB: Kameron Battle, Carrollwood Day (Fla.)\nWR: Jaylen Addai, Shadow Creek (TX)\nWR: Jett Harrison, St. Joseph’s Prep (Pa.)\nWR: TJ Maddox, Winslow Township (N.J.)\nOT: Bryce Smalls, Archbishop Spalding (Md.)\nOL: Kris Scott, Taft (OH)\nC: Carl Noisette, Duluth (Ga.)\nOL: Maxx Jones, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nOT: Azhir Waddell, Dudley (N.C.)\nAll-Purpose: Deandre Bidden, Harper Woods (Mich.)\n\nEdge: Jalanie George, Desert Edge (Ariz.)\nDT: Kingston Brown, Carver (Ga.) \nDT: Jameer Whyce, Trotwood-Madison (OH)\nEdge: Darieon Prescott, Bolingbrook (IL)\nLB: Tysir Young, Middletown (DE)\nLB: Brayden Bonik, Ridge Point (TX)\nCB: Man Robinson, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nCB: Jermaine Cobbins, Springfield (Tenn.)\nS: Pole Moala, Leuzinger (Calif.)\nS: James Foster III, Lancaster (TX)\n\nPK: Luke Marchionni, Hamilton Southeastern (IN)\nP: Julian Trujillo, Eaglecrest (CO)\nReturn Specialist: Dillon Mitchell, C.E.

    "description": "President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"  “They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.  According to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"\n\n“They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nAccording to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.\n\nThe announcement comes just a month after the Navy scrapped its plans to build a new, small warship, citing growing delays and cost overruns, deciding instead to go with a modified version of a Coast Guard cutter that was being produced until recently. The sea service has also failed to build its other newly designed ships, like the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget.\n\nMeanwhile, the Navy has struggled to field some of the technologies Trump says will be aboard the new ship.\n\nThe Navy spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 15 years trying to field a railgun aboard a ship before finally abandoning the effort in 2021.\n\nLaser technology has seen more success in making its way onto Navy ships in recent years, but its employment is still limited. One system that is designed to blind or disable drone sensors is now aboard eight destroyers after spending eight years in development.\n\nDeveloping nuclear cruise missile capabilities or deploying them on ships may also violate non-proliferation treaties that the U.S. has signed with Russia.\n\nA U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing plans, told The Associated Press that design efforts are now underway for the new ship and construction is planned to begin in the early 2030s.\n\nBoth Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically that term has referred to a very specific type of ship — a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.\n\nThis type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the U.S. battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tons. But after World War II, the battleship's role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The U.S. Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned.\n\nAccording to a newly created website for the “Golden Fleet,” this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships but only weigh about half as much, around 35,000 tons, and have far smaller crews — between 650 and 850 sailors.\n\nIts primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.\n\nTrump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy’s fleet, sometimes with a view toward keeping older technology instead of modernizing.\n\nDuring his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy’s newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.\n\nHe has also complained to Phelan about the look of the Navy’s destroyers and decried Navy ships being covered in rust.\n\nPhelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump \"has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one (o’clock) in the morning” about “rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it.”\n\nOn a visit to a shipyard that was working on the now-canceled Constellation-class frigate in 2020, Trump said he personally changed the design of the ship.\n\n“I looked at it, I said, ‘That’s a terrible-looking ship, let’s make it beautiful,’” Trump said at the time.\n\nHe said Monday he will have a direct role in designing this new warship as well.\n\n“The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I’m a very aesthetic person,” Trump said.\n\nPhelan said the new USS Defiant “will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.\"",

    "description": "Lawyers for former CIA Director John Brennan want the Justice Department to be prevented from steering an investigation of him and other former government officials to a “favored” judge in Florida who dismissed the classified documents case against President Donald Trump.  The request Monday is addressed to U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga, the chief judge in the Southern District of Florida, where federal prosecutors are pursuing a criminal investigation related to the U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyers for former CIA Director John Brennan want the Justice Department to be prevented from steering an investigation of him and other former government officials to a “favored” judge in Florida who dismissed the classified documents case against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe request Monday is addressed to U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga, the chief judge in the Southern District of Florida, where federal prosecutors are pursuing a criminal investigation related to the U.S. government assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Brennan and other former officials have received subpoenas, and Brennan's lawyers say he's been advised by prosecutors that he's a target of the investigation.\n\nBrennan's lawyers say in their letter that they are concerned the Justice Department is engaged in “judge-shopping” and trying to arrange for the investigation to be transferred to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who issued favorable rulings to Trump during the classified documents case and dismissed it last year. They asked Altonaga to exercise her “supervisory authority” as chief judge to ensure the Justice Department is unable to steer the current Russia-related matter to her.\n\n“In short, we are seeking assurance that any litigation arising out of this grand jury proceeding will be heard by a judge who is selected by the court’s neutral and impartial processes, not by the prosecution’s self-interested maneuvering contrary to the interests of justice,” wrote Brennan's attorneys, Kenneth Wainstein and Natasha Harnwell-Davis. The New York Times earlier reported on the letter.\n\nIt remains unclear what specific allegations of criminal conduct are being examined by prosecutors in Florida. But the subpoenas issued last month to Brennan and other former law enforcement and intelligence officials sought documents related to the preparation of the Obama administration’s intelligence community assessment, made public in January 2017, that detailed how Russia waged a covert influence campaign to help Trump defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump was investigated, but not charged, during his first term over whether his campaign conspired with Russia to tip the outcome of the election. He has long sought retribution over the Russia investigation and the officials who played a key part in it.\n\nHis Justice Department in September secured a false statement and obstruction indictment against James Comey, the FBI director at the time the Russia probe was launched, though the case against him was dismissed. Its future is in doubt thanks to a judge's ruling that blocked prosecutors, in the event they try to revive the case, from relying on communications they consider to be key evidence.\n\nBrennan's lawyers say the Trump administration Justice Department tried to “forum-shop” the investigation of him to multiple jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, before settling in Florida. But they say prosecutors have been unable to answer basic questions about why Florida is a proper venue for the investigation given that the intelligence community assessment at issue was produced by officials in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nThough it is not clear that the Justice Department will ultimately produce charges, Brennan's request reflects the fact that judges who oversee grand jury investigations can be called upon to make important decisions and resolve significant disputes, including over witness testimony, that can affect the course of the inquiry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation is currently based in the Miami division of the Southern District of Florida, but Brennan's lawyers say they're concerned that the Trump administration may be poised to try to transfer the case to the smaller Fort Pierce division, where Cannon is the only judge. They cited as a basis for that alarm a Justice Department decision to seek an additional grand jury in Fort Pierce even though, Brennan's lawyers say, there's no apparent caseload need.\n\n“The United States Attorney’s efforts to funnel this investigation to the judge who issued this string of rulings that consistently favored President Trump’s positions in previous litigations should be seen for what it is,” Brennan's lawyers wrote.",

    "fullText": "The search for the 57-year-old Fort Myers attorney and his 33-year-old nephew continues Sunday after the pair was reported missing Dec. 19 after a fishing trip off the coast of Naples.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard is leading the search along with partner agencies to find attorney Randall Spivey and his nephew Brandon Billmaier, who were reported missing at about 9 p.m. Friday. The boat they'd been using for their trip had been scheduled to return at about sunset.\n\nThe pair went out in a 42-foot Freeman boat named \"Unstopp-A-Bull,\" according to Luis Garcia, the supervisor on watch for the Coast Guard sector in St. Petersburg. The Coast Guard found the boat floating upright in the Gulf about 70 miles off the coast of Naples, with no signs of the missing boaters.\n\nNow, one of the largest searches in Southwest Florida history is underway, with a large community effort behind it.\n\nHere's what we know so far, as of noon, Sunday, Dec. 21.\n\nAs of 10 a.m. Sunday, Dec. 21, Randall Spivey and Brandon Billmaier, the Florida boaters reported missing Dec. 19 after a fishing trip off the coast of Naples, had not been found, according to Billmaier's wife, Deborah.\n\n\"Updates after speaking with the U.S. Coast Guard this morning,\" Deborah Billmaier wrote in a Facebook post Sunday. \"The EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon) was unfortunately still on the boat. They were bottom fishing when the incident occurred (still not sure exactly what occurred.)\"\n\nThe post also mentioned that a couple of life jackets were not found on the boat, indicating that Spivey and Billmaier may be wearing them.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg posted news of the search on social media Saturday morning, Dec. 20.\n\nAccording to the Facebook post, air and surface crews from the agency and partner agencies U.S. Coast Guard Station Fort Myers Beach, U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Miami and Lee County Sheriff's Office are involved in the search.\n\n\"The search effort support features an 87-foot boat on water, 45-foot boat, 60-foot helicopter, 144 plane, 6130 Air Force from Patrick Air Force Base and an 144 continuing through the day (not sure if this is a boat or a plane),\" Deborah Billmaier wrote in her post the following morning.\n\nAn urgent marine broadcast has also been issued to all vessels in the area to help expand the search range, said Billmaier.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard coordinated one of the largest search parties in Southwest Florida history Sunday morning, Dec. 21, starting at first light, according to Deborah Billmaier, wife of Brandon, Billmaier. In her Facebook post, she asked those with capable vessels to help out.\n\nFlorida Rep. Peggy Gossett-Seidman shared the post on X.\n\nErin Shaw Harrel of Facebook group SWFL Boaters urged people Saturday to take to the water to search for the missing boaters, providing these coordinates for the search: 25-51.67N 083-12.16W.\n\nBrent Stokes, owner of Stokes Marine, also asked for volunteers to help search.\n\nAccording to Stokes, anyone willing to help with the search could call Tricia Spivey at 239-896-4099 or the U.S. Coast Guard at 727-322-4180.\n\nAttorney Randall Spivey, 57, and his 33-year-old nephew Brandon Billmaier were reported missing at about 9 p.m. Friday, Dec. 19.\n\nTricia Spivey reported her husband and nephew missing Friday night, said Luis Garcia, supervisor on watch for the Coast Guard sector in St. Petersburg. “They were going to fish about 102 miles offshore.”\n\nSpivey is a white male, 6’1”, 245lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing khaki pants and a dark in color shirt, according to Lee County Sheriff's Office. Billmaier is a white male, 6’2”, 250lbs, with strawberry hair and brown eyes.\n\nThe pair went out in a 42-foot Freeman boat named \"Unstopp-A-Bull,\" Garcia said. The Coast Guard later found the boat floating upright in the Gulf about 70 miles off the coast of Naples, but no signs of the missing boaters.\n\nTricia Spivey says GPS coordinates from the boat's spot tracker led them to that location near Marco Island and Flamingo. That's where the search has been concentrated.\n\nThe Lee County Sheriff's Office requested the public's help in locating Spivey and Billmaier.\n\nIf anyone knows about the pair's whereabouts, they can call 911, if applicable, or call the sheriff's office at 477-1000. To remain anonymous, you can also call SWFL Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-TIPS.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Myers News-Press: Missing boaters updates Sunday as search continues in Florida",

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",
