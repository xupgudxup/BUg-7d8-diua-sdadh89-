    "description": "Nicknamed \"Venice of America,\" Florida's Fort Lauderdale isn't quite a dupe for the Italian city, but there are great things to do if you visit.",
    "fullText": "I've lived in Miami for nearly a decade, and one of my favorite things to do is travel around Florida.\n\nOne of my go-to spots is Fort Lauderdale, a refreshing city right on the Atlantic Ocean located about 30 miles north of Miami.\n\nWith a population of about 200,000 residents, this eastern Florida city is known for its quieter beaches, walkable downtown, and vibrant stores and restaurants.\n\nIt's also famous for having hundreds of miles of canals that curl in and around the city — a feature that's earned it the nickname \"Venice of America.\" Just like in Italy's Venice, these winding waterways are very much a part of daily life in this Florida city.\n\nHowever, if your mind is now swimming with images of Italy's lagoon-encased city filled with gondolas, keep reading before you book your trip to Fort Lauderdale.\n\nIf you plan on visiting Fort Lauderdale and want to indulge in the city's Venetian spirit, I've got suggestions for popular things you can do in the city.\n\nFor one, you'll want to head downtown and make Las Olas your home base. Las Olas Boulevard is a pedestrian-friendly roadway that runs parallel to the New River, which sits a few blocks south.\n\nIt stretches all the way to the beaches, but the part closer to the US-1 highway in the west is where you'll find the most popular stores and restaurants — many of which tout their water views to guests and offer lots of outdoor seating.\n\nHere, you can set out on foot to shop along the tree-lined boulevard, grab brunch at the French-inspired Café Bastille Fort Lauderdale, or visit the Historic Stranahan House Museum by the water.\n\nThough downtown Fort Lauderdale is definitely walkable — especially compared to other parts of South Florida — you don't have to set out on foot if you don't want to.\n\nLike the vaporetto in Venice, the area offers water taxis that you can pay to ride, but I suggest the LauderGO! Water Trolley, which is free.\n\nThe trolley transports visitors along the New River in Downtown Fort Lauderdale, allowing them to travel seamlessly from one popular spot to the next.\n\nIt runs from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., traveling in a loop and stopping at popular locations along the north and south sides of the river, including Riverfront Plaza, Esplanade Park, and Tarpon River.\n\nWhen I visited Venice, one of my favorite things to do was walk along the canals early in the morning or right before dusk. The gentle lapping of the water was calming, and the views were as beautiful as what I'd seen in pictures online.\n\nIn Fort Lauderdale, you can get that same feeling by wandering along the Riverwalk, a passageway that, as the name suggests, follows the curve and flow of the New River.\n\nI enjoy walking here in the morning with a coffee in hand, unhurried, as I take in the beautiful nature of South Florida.\n\nThe city is definitely worth a visit in its own right, but picturing an Italian-style city plopped down along Florida's southeastern coast will only set you up for disappointment — and you'll miss out on all the incredible things Fort Lauderdale has to offer.\n\nAlthough the vibes in these two cities are completely different, both have some beautiful canals that are integral to the local community.\n\nFort Lauderdale is no dupe for Italy, but it's a wonderful pick if you're looking to enjoy some waterside dining and sunshine.",

    "fullText": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of killing a traveling salesman during a robbery is set to become Florida's first execution of 2026 under a death warrant signed Friday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who signed off on a record 19 executions last year.\n\nRonald Palmer Heath, 64, is scheduled to die by lethal injection Feb. 10 at Florida State Prison. DeSantis oversaw more executions in a single year in 2025 than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The previous record was set in 2014 with eight executions.\n\nHeath was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery with a death weapon and multiple forgery charges in 1990.\n\nAccording to court records, Heath and his brother, Kenneth Heath, met traveling salesman Michael Sheridan at a Gainesville bar in May 1989. After hanging out at the bar for some time, the three men agreed to go somewhere else to smoke marijuana.\n\nAt some point, the brothers plotted to rob the other man, investigators said. Ronald Heath drove the group to a remote area, where Kenneth Heath pulled a handgun on Sheridan. The man initially refused to give the brothers anything, and Kenneth Heath shot Sheridan in the chest.\n\nAs Sheridan emptied his pockets, Ronald Heath began kicking the man and stabbing him with a hunting knife, prosecutors said. Kenneth Heath then shot Sheridan twice in the head.\n\nThe brothers dumped Sheridan's body in a wooded area and returned to the Gainesville bar to take items from his rental car. The brothers made multiple purchases with Sheridan's credit cards the next day at a Gainesville mall.\n\nRonald Heath was arrested several weeks later at his Douglas, Georgia, home after investigators connected him to the stolen credit cards. Officers recovered clothing purchased with the stolen cards, as well as Sheridan's watch, according to court records.\n\nKenneth Heath was also charged with Sheridan's murder, but he was sentenced to life in prison as part of a plea agreement.\n\nAttorneys for Ronald Heath are expected to file appeals to the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nA total of 47 people were executed in the U.S. in 2025. Florida led the way with a flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis. The state's final execution of 2025 was the Dec. 18 lethal injection of Frank Athen Walls, who was convicted of fatally shooting a man and his girlfriend during a home invasion robbery.",

The 10-day mission will have four astronauts on board who’ll be testing if Orion’s critical life support systems can sustain human passengers on future longer duration missions. They will first orbit the Earth twice before making their way 4,700 miles beyond the far side of the moon. If the SLS and Orion system is rolled out as planned, NASA intends to conduct a wet dress rehearsal at the end of January.

    "fullText": "The post Crocodile Crush: Why Florida’s Top Predator Isn’t Always the One You Think appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nBurmese pythons achieved the near-total disappearance of 3 native species in the Florida Everglades.\n\nSome species, such as foxes, marsh rabbits, and cottontail rabbits, have almost completely disappeared because of pythons in the area.\n\n2005 field data counterintuitively confirm that a Burmese python can consume an entire American alligator.\n\nPythons utilize nest-raiding to win the battle before crocodiles ever reach the showdown.\n\nWho do you think would win a fight between a python and a crocodile in Florida?\n\nGenerally, we would look to real-life examples for clues, but surprisingly, there isn’t very much of that. While there are a few examples of pythons getting into it with alligators in Florida, they don’t seem to have many significant interactions with crocodiles.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that we can’t wager a pretty good guess on our own, though. We can actually take a look at pythons and crocodiles in Florida and see who would emerge victorious in an encounter between them.\n\nThe Burmese python is not a native species in Florida. However, they are often found around the Everglades in South Florida. Native to Southeast Asia, Burmese pythons were first brought to the United States as exotic pets. Some pet owners ended up releasing the snakes into the wild, and the problem began.\n\nThe Burmese python is now considered to be a nuisance to the Everglades ecosystem, and for good reason. These pythons compete with native animals for food. They have also caused severe declines in many native species, including bobcats, opossums, and raccoons.\n\nSome species, such as foxes, marsh rabbits, and cottontail rabbits, have almost completely disappeared because of pythons.\n\nIn fact, they’ve even been known to eat alligators in some cases. In 2005, in the Florida Everglades, the body of a Burmese python was found with an American alligator in its stomach!\n\nThe American crocodile, or Crocodylus acutus, generally populate South Florida. This is the northern end of the crocodile’s range in most cases. They can be found in coves, ponds, and creeks in mangrove swamps, and they typically inhabit saltwater or brackish areas.\n\nFloridians will often see crocodiles basking in the sun. Because they’re ectothermic animals, they rely on external heat to regulate their body temperatures.\n\nThey are the largest reptiles on earth and are said to be able to produce tears. They can’t chew their food, and to improve digestion, they have been known to swallow rocks. Crocodiles also have special hearts. Their hearts have four chambers just like humans do!\n\nShy and reclusive, they’re generally not a danger to people. If they’re approached by a person while basking in the sun, they’ll usually just quickly escape into the water.\n\nAmerican crocodiles typically eat small mammals, frogs, fish, turtles, and birds. Humans are the main threats to crocodiles because of habitat destruction and illegal hunting.\n\nCrocodile nests are also in danger due to predators, such as birds, crabs, and raccoons. In some cases, pythons will even eat alligator and crocodile eggs.\n\nPythons live in tropical areas of Asia and Africa. They can thrive in either wet or dry environments; however, they are freshwater and fully marine. They like it where it is hot and wet so their bodies can stay warm. They are usually found in rainforests, woodlands, grasslands, swamps, and shrubs.\n\nThese types of environments are home to many different creatures, such as the crocodile. That’s why these creatures are natural enemies because they share the same waters and wetlands.\n\nIf a Ball Python are able to survive adulthood, they can live about 10 to 15 years in the wild. However, the expected lifespan for a ball python living in captivity is around 30 years. Some, however, have been recorded to live over 50 years old when cared for properly.\n\nWhen predicting who would win in a battle between a python and a crocodile, we need to consider all of the factors. Knowledge of the physical features of both of these animals is very helpful in this process.\n\nPythons are often longer than crocodiles, reaching up to 26 feet long, while crocodiles usually aren’t more than 20 feet long. However, crocodiles do have the size advantage, as they tend to be much heavier. While a python is typically no more than about 200 pounds, a crocodile can be up to 2,000 pounds.\n\nCrocodiles have the size advantage over pythons.\n\nBoth pythons and crocodiles have the ability to stay submerged under water for stretches of time. However, crocodiles are much faster, being able to run up to about 25 miles per hour in some cases. Pythons only slither at about one mile per hour. Even if crocodiles can only run for short distances, they can easily catch up to a python in most cases.\n\nCrocodiles have the speed advantage over pythons.\n\nPythons do have the ability to use heat sensors and chemical receptors to stalk their prey. However, they typically have poor eyesight. Crocodiles have better eyesight and are able to see in the dark. They have strong senses of hearing and smell, as well as the ability to sense even subtle changes in pressure.\n\nCrocodiles have keener senses than pythons.\n\nPythons and crocodiles are both relatively large animals, although crocodiles are significantly larger. Pythons can camouflage themselves fairly effectively. Pythons and crocodiles both have the ability to submerge themselves underwater.\n\nIn terms of physical defenses, it’s a tie between pythons and crocodiles.\n\nBoth pythons and crocodiles are known for surprise attacks. Pythons have sharp teeth and the ability to constrict their prey with their bodies. Their bite is painful, but they’re not venomous, and it is not a strong enough bite to be fatal in most cases. Crocodiles, on the other hand, have the strongest bite ever seen in a living animal.\n\nGiven the vital stats of both competitors in this fight, we’d have to say that in an encounter between a python and a crocodile in Florida, the crocodile would probably be the winner.\n\nOf course, pythons are not completely powerless. If they’re able to get past a crocodile mother and eat crocodile eggs, they can prevent crocodiles from even getting to the fight in the first place.\n\nPythons can clearly hold their own, which is why they are so successful as an invasive species in Florida. But given the size and strength of the crocodile, it would likely be no contest between the two. Perhaps at some point, we’ll see evidence of crocodiles helping to control this invasive species.\n\nThe simple answer here is yes. The python lives in an aquatic type habitat and while swimming it is vulnerable to attack. This means that if a python is in the water, it is within perfect striking conditions for crocodiles. While younger snakes can be captured and eaten more easily by a crocodile of any size. The older python the larger it gets, so depending on the age of the snake the crocodile may not attack.\n\nThe post Crocodile Crush: Why Florida’s Top Predator Isn’t Always the One You Think appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

He spent the previous three seasons with the Seminoles.\n\nEdwin Joseph is a native of Hollywood, Florida, where he played at Chaminade-Madonna Prep. He was a four-star recruit in the Class of 2023. Within that recruiting cycle, Joseph was the 345th-ranked player overall and the 11th-ranked athlete.\n\nWhile in high school, Joseph won back-to-back state championships. In 2022, he was also named a Nat Moore Trophy finalist.\n\nIn 2023, Joseph would play in four games, utilizing a redshirt that season. By 2024, he had played in all 12 games for the Florida State defense, and in 2025, he was a consistent starter at the safety position. For his career, he’d finish playing in 28 games for the Seminoles.\n\nDuring that time, he had 51 total tackles, 7.0 tackles for a loss, and 1.5 sacks. He would also snag four interceptions and defend nine passes. The vast majority of that production came during the 2025 season.\n\nEdwin Joseph and Mike Norvell did have a public back-and-forth during the season. That wasn’t the first time those two teams had publicly butted heads.\n\nIt was a difficult two seasons for Florida State on the whole. After winning the ACC in 2023, the Seminoles have failed to make a bowl game in the two subsequent years.\n\nThat included bottoming out to 2-10 in 2024 and going just 3-13 in ACC play during that time. Now, it appears as though the Seminoles will undergo some heavy turnover in the Transfer Portal, which Norvell will quickly need to address.\n\nNow, Joseph is going to be looking for an opportunity in Oxford. He’ll have two seasons of eligibility remaining once he gets there.\n\nMoreover, Joseph was rated as a four-star prospect in the On3 Transfer Portal Industry Rankings. He was the No. 75 overall recruit, and the No. 4 overall safety available after entering their name into the portal before committing to a new beginning. You can check out the full rankings HERE to see where each athlete slots in.\n\nThe 2025-26 college football transfer portal will last 15 days, spanning from Jan. 2 to Jan. 16, the NCAA decided. While players have just over two weeks  to enter the portal, they’re not under a deadline to commit when they enter. Traditionally, the cut-off for committing has been how late a school can enroll a player through admissions, so it varies throughout the sport.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

    "description": "One of Crystal Roure's last acts alive was to tell her 12-year-old son to get out of the house and call 911. Her family believes it saved his life.",
    "fullText": "As a single mom, Crystal Roure was fiercely protective of her children.\n\nSo when she started dating a handsome man from church, Crystal didn’t introduce him right away. In fact, she waited until they had dated for a full year before he met the kids.\n\n“She took her time,\" Crystal's sister, Stephanie Roure, told USA TODAY this week. \"She did have a happy glow that I haven't seen in a long time ... My sister trusted him and fell in love with him. She finally found her happy ever after.\"\n\nBut on Dec. 22, just two years after Crystal married Jason Kenney, he would end up killing her and shooting her 13-year-old daughter in the face in their Florida home − all over an argument about watching a football game three days before Christmas, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office. Kenney later fatally shot himself.\n\nThe crime during the December holidays shocked the nation.\n\n“The 13-year-old girl begged not to be shot – ‘Please don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me,’” Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a news conference the week of the attack. “And he shot her twice.”\n\nNow as Crystal's family reels from grief and shock, USA TODAY is telling her story and how she used her final moments alive to save her children.\n\nFrom an early age, Crystal Roure showed ambition and a commitment to hard work.\n\nHer sister Stephanie recalled how Crystal did well in school and thrived when she got her first job at T.G.I. Friday's as a teenager, quickly graduating from hostess to server.\n\n\"What set her apart from others was she didn't just work for a paycheck ... she worked for the experience,\" Stephanie said. \"She worked for the knowledge. She worked to prove to herself she was able to do things and not give up.\"\n\nBut when she became a mom at the age of 25, \"everything she did from that moment on was for her children.\"\n\n\"She worked harder and longer,\" Stephanie said. \"And somehow she was superwoman. She managed to hold down a full-time job and being a full-time mother.\"\n\nThough Crystal had to juggle work and the kids all while being single, she didn't miss a school function, award ceremony or field trip. She also managed to buy a house all on her own, \"because she was a smart woman,\" Stephanie said.\n\n\"Her children were her world. She worked hard for them, to provide for them. She protected them,\" she said. \"They came first before anything.\"\n\nEarly in the relationship, Facebook photos show the pair smiling and kissing each other in many selfies. Other show them and the kids looking like a picture-perfect family, posing in front of a Christmas tree and at a baseball game.\n\nBut sometime after they married on Nov. 4, 2023, Stephanie said: \"My sister lost that glow she had.\"\n\nAt first, Stephanie chalked up the change to the fact that Crystal became pregnant with her third child pretty quickly after the wedding.\n\n\"I remember asking her, 'Are you OK?'\" Stephanie said. \"She said, 'Yes,' it's just this pregnancy was really kicking her butt because she was much older.\"\n\nThough Stephanie said she always had an \"ehh\" feeling about Kenney, she thought her sister was happy and safe.\n\nThat is until she got the worst phone call of her life.\n\nCrystal and her three kids spent the evening of Dec. 22 by the Christmas tree at their home in Highland City, just east of Tampa. Meanwhile Kenney was in his shed, drinking and watching Monday Night Football until about 11 p.m., Sheriff Judd said.\n\nWhen Kenney went inside the home and wanted to continue watching the game, a fight ensued. It became so scary that Crystal told her 12-year-old son to run to a neighbor's house and call 911, Judd said.\n\nAs the boy ran out, he heard the first gunshot. Responding deputies found Crystal dead inside, her 13-year-old daughter shot in the face and shoulder, and Jason Kenney gone. They also found a letter Crystal wrote to her husband telling him: \"You're drinking, you’re using cocaine again. This is not the way the family should be. You need God.\"\n\nThe 1-year-old daughter the couple shared was unharmed. The 13-year-old survived the gunshot wound after the bullet hit the bridge of her nose and deflected through the top of her head, Judd said.\n\nAfter shooting his wife and step-daughter, Kenney drove in his truck to his late father's home and called his sister to say he had \"done something very, very bad\" and that it was the last time they would ever talk, Judd said.\n\nDeputies tracked Kenney down to a shed on his father's property. When they called for him to come out, they heard a single gunshot and found Kenney dead inside.\n\nJudd said that a relative told deputies that Kenney had been beating on Crystal \"for a while,\" though the sheriff's office has no records of any domestic violence calls or charges. Jason Kenney had no criminal history, Judd said.\n\n\"He absolutely destroyed a family,\" Judd said. \"When you go in there, there is a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of Christmas presents under the tree, just like the nuclear family should be ... and it ends up this way.\"\n\nCrystal's family is leaning on each other as they absorb the shock of her murder and raising funds for the children. Crystal's 13-year-old daughter \"is doing well on her recovery\" and \"it really is a miracle that the bullet missed every major thing,\" Stephanie said.\n\nAs for any abuse leading up to the tragedy, Stephanie said it's possible but she wasn't aware of any.\n\n\"After they were married I know she said he was drinking a lot more but she said that he was going to stop and said he would get help with it. Obviously that didn't happen,\" she said, adding that when she went over to visit, Kenney would \"sit outside in the shed playing games on his phone and smoking his cigarettes.\"\n\n\"If there was abuse happening he must have scared her to the point not to say or do anything because the type of person my sister was she would have left at the first sight of trouble because she would protect her kids,\" she said. \"But that's a question we'll never have answers to.\"\n\nStephanie said she's angry that Kenney killed her sister and tried to kill her niece but that she's so proud of Crystal and her nephew's actions that night.\n\n\"My sister died a hero for protecting her children and getting my nephew out of the house to make the 911 call,\" she said. \"She did that. She saved their lives and by doing so my nephew saved his sister's life, and thank God the baby was untouched.\"\n\nStephanie said she is going to do her best to teach her 1-year-old niece all about who her mom was.\n\n\"I will never let these kids forget the love and strength and courage she had for them,\" she said. \"They will always know that she loved them and put them first.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Florida mom of three killed by husband over NFL game 'died a hero'",

    "description": "One night at the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach wasn't enough time to take advantage of amenities like a five-star spa and a private beach.",
    "fullText": "As I'm stuck in my NYC apartment on a brisk day in January, I can't help but daydream about the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach in Florida. I spent one night there in October 2025 and booked the cheapest available room for $920.\n\nSitting in a cushioned rattan chair on my balcony as the sun went down, I could see the pool surrounded by palms and cabanas, tropical gardens, and the five-star hotel's private beach. It was the epitome of tropical luxury, and I couldn't believe I'd be leaving in the morning.\n\nThe oceanfront hotel in Palm Beach, Florida, is four stories tall with 207 rooms and suites — all of which have their own balcony.\n\nI've stayed at three Four Seasons hotels, and one thing I've learned is that each location is designed to suit the destination. So I wasn't surprised when I stepped inside the lobby and found a tropical decor style.\n\nWith details like chandeliers resembling ropes and pastel pillows patterned with fruit and leaves, it was impossible to forget I was in Florida.\n\nI booked a Palm View room, complete with a king-sized bed across from a TV, a small sitting area, and plenty of floor space. The interior design blended midcentury modern furnishings with pastel accents, making the room feel like a little beach house.\n\nIt was larger than most hotel room balconies I've seen, and there was a table and two cushioned chairs. As the sun began to set, I sat and took in the view of the gardens and the ocean. I long for more sunsets on this balcony.\n\nThe spa features a eucalyptus steam room, a saltwater whirlpool, and a range of treatments, including massages and facials. With less than 24 hours at this hotel, I didn't have time to use the spa.\n\nIf I had another night at the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach, I would have dined at Florie's.\n\nHerbs in the seasonal cocktails at Florie's Bar come straight from the hotel's garden. For those like me who don't drink, there are plenty of non-alcoholic cocktails available.\n\nThe restaurant serves dishes cooked over a live fire, from pizzas to steaks and fish entrées.\n\nI would also have loved to dine on the shaded patio at Seaway, a seafood restaurant with a wide selection of proteins, including lobster, stone crab, and local red snappers, as well as oysters, tiger shrimp, and fresh tuna.\n\nMany of the dishes feature tropical ingredients, such as coconut, pomegranate, and mango.\n\nI wish I'd had time to relax by the pool while being served frozen fruit and cooling towels.\n\nHow often do you find a pristine beach free of crowds on a hot day?\n\nJust past the pool at the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach, a sandy pathway leads to a private beach exclusive to Four Seasons guests. When I went, it was quiet and mostly empty. I wish I could have spent more time on this exclusive strip of the Florida coastline.\n\nTo truly relax into the luxury beach vibe of this five-star resort, I'll have to return for a longer stay to try the restaurants, experience poolside service, and spend more time on a quiet, peaceful beach.",

    "description": "The coldest air will be short-lived. By midweek, most of Florida is expected to be back to a more normal winter weather routine.",
    "fullText": "A vigorous cold front is forecast to slide through Florida with confidence increasing that the pulse of winter chill will be felt all the way to the Keys.\n\nThe Canadian-cooled air is expected to reach the Panhandle on Sunday, Jan. 11 with wind chill temperatures possibly plummeting into the 20s during the early morning hours of Monday, Jan. 12 and daytime highs reaching only into the low 50s.\n\nIn the southern reaches of the state, low temperatures could dip into the upper 40s to mid-50s inland with the lower 60s felt along the water-warmed coasts. Daytime highs should hover around 70 degrees early in the week for much of South Florida.\n\nWhile meteorologists aren’t expecting the same slap of frigid temperatures that welcomed in the New Year — West Palm Beach got socked by a mercury reading of 39 degrees on Dec. 31 — it will be a change from more recent record-challenging heat:\n\nApalachicola sizzled at 77 degrees on Jan. 7, tying its record warm temperature set for that day in 1974.\n\nMiami reached 82 degrees, a full 6 degrees warmer than normal but below the 87-degree record set for that day in 2017.\n\nFort Pierce, on the Treasure Coast, was 84 degrees Jan. 7. That's 9 degrees above normal and near the record high of 86 set in 1990.\n\n“Everyone is talking about how warm it is and I’m thrilled with it. I love really warm weather,” said Lynn Murphy, who was working the front desk at the Driftwood Inn in the Panhandle city of Mexico Beach. “The high today (Jan. 8) is supposed to be 73 and I’m in long sleeves wishing I had a jacket.”\n\nMore: Dense fog blankets Florida: Advisories from the Panhandle to Miami\n\nThe cold front is attached to a zippy area of low pressure that will move northeast with a mix of rain and snow for areas from Michigan to Maine.\n\nRain chances increase for the western reaches of the Panhandle on Friday, Jan. 9, with up to an 80% chance of showers in Pensacola on Saturday, Jan. 10.\n\nAnd while North Florida could get whacked with temperatures in the upper 30s, the chill will moderate as it moves down the Peninsula.\n\n“Crystal River, Cedar Key, maybe Gainesville will be near the southern edge of the colder temperatures below 40 degrees,” said Brandon Buckingham, a meteorologist with AccuWeather. “It’s not a pure Arctic air mass but will be a return of a typical winter weather pattern.”\n\nA swirl of high pressure has dominated the southeast, pumping tropical air into more northerly latitudes, and allowing temperatures to rise. Weather gauges monitored by the Southeast Regional Climate Center have the average temperatures from Pensacola to Leesburg west of Daytona Beach at up to 9 degrees warmer than normal this month.\n\nEast coast cities from Miami to Vero Beach are still recovering from the New Year’s chill with temperatures between 1 and 2 degrees below normal since Jan. 1.\n\n“This won’t be like what we saw last time,\" said Miami-based National Weather Service meteorologist George Rizzuto trying to temper expectations. “We will see slightly reduced humidity and slightly reduced temperatures. The parent cyclone is going to be too far to the northeast.”\n\nThe coldest air will be short-lived. By midweek, most of Florida is expected to be back to a more normal winter weather routine.\n\nKimberly Miller is a journalist for the USA TODAY NETWORK FLORIDA.

    "title": "Google billionaire Larry Page copies the Jeff Bezos playbook, buying a $173 million Miami compound that will save him millions in taxes",
    "description": "Critics warned a wealth tax in California would lead to a billionaire exodus. Florida says come on in, the water's warm.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Larry Page has quietly—or loudly—joined the billionaire exodus from California, shifting businesses east and dropping about $173 million on two ultra-luxury waterfront mansions in Miami’s Coconut Grove in a move that looks strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos’ relocation playbook. The timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look downright Bezos-ian.​\n\nIn late December and early January, The Wall Street Journal reported, Page snapped up two neighboring estates in Miami’s Coconut Grove, paying roughly $101.5 million for one waterfront compound and $71.9 million for another in an off‑market deal, for a combined outlay of about $173.4 million. One of the homes, previously listed for $135 million, spans 13 bedrooms and 15.5 bathrooms and sits directly on the water, while the second, bought from heiress Sloan Lindemann Barnett and her husband Roger Barnett, nearly doubled in value in less than five years.​\n\nThe purchases plant Page squarely inside one of Miami’s most exclusive enclaves, long favored by global elites seeking privacy, water access, and low‑key luxury. Local brokers say his splashy entry is part of a broader surge of high‑net‑worth Californians scouting Coconut Grove and other South Florida neighborhoods as they hedge against looming tax changes while upgrading to trophy waterfront properties. The real-estate purchases double as both a luxury retreat and a massive tax‑savings vehicle, with Page the most prominent of California’s ultrawealthy choosing to leave as state lawmakers are targeting fortunes like his with an aggressive wealth‑tax push.\n\nBehind the real-estate headlines, Page has been methodically severing his financial and legal ties to California ahead of a proposed wealth tax that targets residents worth more than $1 billion. Regulatory filings show he has moved his family office and several investment and holding entities out of the state, Business Insider reported, reincorporating key vehicles in Delaware and listing new business addresses in Florida.​\n\nThe New York Times previously reported Page had been telling associates he was considering Florida specifically because of a proposed ballot measure that would impose a 5% annual levy on the worldwide assets of billionaires domiciled in California. If passed and applied retroactively to residents as of Jan. 1, 2026, analysts estimate the tax could cost Page—currently ranked as the world’s second‑richest person—well over $10 billion.\n\n​​Some Silicon Valley executives, notably Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, warned such an outcome was possible, saying in late December founders would have to sell off parts of their companies to pay for “fraud, waste, and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.” California Rep. Ro Khanna responded to the Times‘ reporting that Page and Peter Thiel were looking to leave by flagging the story on X and saying, seemingly sarcastically in the style of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “I will miss them very much.”",

    "fullText": "It didn't take long for Florida quarterback DJ Lagway to find a new team. Less than a month after announcing his intent to transfer, Lagway reportedly committed to Baylor, according to Rivals.com.\n\nLagway's decision comes a day after he visited the school and was spotted attending a Baylor basketball game with Bears football coach Dave Aranda.\n\nBREAKING: Florida transfer QB DJ Lagway has committed to Baylor, @Hayesfawcett3 reports🐻https://t.co/WDcp436N9Y pic.twitter.com/GeiyboBmFg\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 8, 2026\n\nLagway, considered the top quarterback in the 2024 class, turned in a strong freshman season with the Gators. After starting the year on the bench, Lagway was pushed into the starting lineup following an injury to Graham Mertz.\n\nLagway threw for 456 yards and three scores in his first start, and then led Florida to a 6-1 record down the stretch, taking down multiple ranked opponents before beating Tulane in a bowl game.\n\nThat strong finish led to heightened expectations for both Lagway and Florida entering the 2025 season. Florida opened the year ranked No. 15 in the AP poll, and then rose to No. 13 after taking down LIU to kick off the season. But a loss to South Florida the following week dropped Florida out of the top-25.\n\nThat proved to be a harbinger of what was to come. Florida finished the year 4-8 and failed to jump back into the top-25 the rest of the way.\n\nLagway played a significant role in the team's demise. After being limited by shoulder issues last offseason, Lagway didn't play up to expectations as a sophomore, finishing the year with just 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 12 games.",

    "description": "The Seminoles have a new punter",
    "fullText": "The Florida State Seminoles are welcoming a new punter to Tallahassee. Daniel Hughes, who spent the 2025 season with the New Mexico Lobos, is transferring to FSU.\n\nHughes is 27 years old and is originally from Melbourne, Australia, and stands 6-foot-5, weighing 235 pounds. He has three years of eligibility remaining and owns a 4.0 GPA. He has a respectable social media following as well, and this article sheds some light on his uniqueness.\n\nHughes had quite a year in New Mexico after spending his prior season in JUCO. He put up numbers that weren’t school records only due to lack of total number of punts in New Mexico’s excellent offense. His net average of 43.6 yards per punt (on 37 total punts) would have been good for the second-best mark in Mountain West Conference history in addition to becoming a New Mexico school record.\n\nFrom the press release for his Honorable Mention All-Mountain West team selection:\n\nDaniel Hughes – Honorable Mention (P)\n\nA Ray Guy Award semifinalist, he is averaging 45.9 yards per punt with a net of 43.6 on just 37 punts with 12 inside the 20 and 13 punts of 50 yards or more. He has not shown up in the stats all season because of the lack of punts by UNM, but would be 16th nationally in punting.\n\nNew Mexico is seventh nationally in net punting, and the 43.6-yard average would easily be a school record, and it would be the second-best net punting mark in Mountain West history. He has averaged at least 46.0 yards per punt in seven of the 12 games this season (and it’s really seven of 11 as UNM didn’t punt against Nevada). Opponents are averaging 3.9 per return, and opponents have muffed three of his punts (8.1%).\n\nJunior College: Lettered in football for one season at City College of San Francisco … played in 10 games as a freshman, punting 49 times for a 37.3 yard average … had a long of 62 … pinned his opponents inside the 20 18 times on the season and forced 13 fair catches … had just two touchbacks.\n\nHigh School: Hughes did not play football at Mount Erin … he did play Footy in the Victorian Football League (VFL), playing for the Northern Bullants in 2021 and 2022, seeing action in 15 games.",

    "fullText": "Nearly 15 years ago, I moved to a small town on Florida's Space Coast, about three hours away from where I grew up in Miami.\n\nI hadn't planned to move out of the city forever, but I've since fallen in love with my quieter, slower pace of life. Fortunately, I'm not too far from where I grew up — and I've never stopped going back to Miami for visits a few times a year.\n\nI don't regret moving, and it turns out that living just a short drive from home comes with a lot of perks.\n\nAt first, returning to Miami after having just moved away felt so different.\n\nI'd been feeling pretty homesick, and I didn't immediately embrace small-town living in my new slice of Florida. However, once I was back home, I realized I felt most like myself in Miami — something I doubt I'd ever have noticed if I had never left.\n\nThat said, moving away ultimately helped me better understand myself and how my values have been shaped.\n\nFor instance, I forget how much everyday can feel like a party in Miami until I go back, and then I see that lively city is where I get the perspective that life should be celebrated.\n\nI've realized that even though I've left Miami, I can carry some of my favorite parts of the city with me wherever I go — and that's been really empowering.\n\nFor example, one of the things I miss most about Miami is its incredible Cuban food scene. I've yet to find anything as good where I live now, so I've learned how to make many of my favorite Cuban dishes at home.\n\nWith Cuban food being so accessible and affordable in Miami, I likely never would've learned how to cook any of it on my own if I still lived there.\n\nAnd, whenever I'm back in Miami, I still always stop at all of my favorite restaurants that just can't quite be replicated anywhere else.\n\nAll of my closest friends and some family members still live in Miami, so when I visit, I really get to spend a lot of time with whoever I'm staying with.\n\nWhile I'm often sad that we don't live close by and can't see each other all the time, I probably spend more quality time with them now than I did when I lived there.\n\nIn some ways, it's easier to see someone when it requires a bit of intentional planning, and you can't just pop by each other's homes anytime.\n\nSince I'm no longer a local, I get to see the city from a new perspective. I've loved experiencing the restaurants, nightlife, and beaches as visitors do — it's truly an energetic and unique place.\n\nI've noticed things that I didn't even realize I missed, such as driving around specific parts of Miami. I get to see how things are changing, but even places that have been there my whole life somehow seem more novel to me now.\n\nSince I've moved away, I've become more appreciative of certain things back home, particularly the food and my friendships.\n\nI feel really lucky to live just a short drive from the city I grew up in, which also happens to be a really fun place to visit. I'm aware that if home were a plane ride away, I definitely wouldn't be able to visit as often.\n\nWhen I'm there, I get to remember who I am and where I come from. However, I also get to see where I grew up in a new light, almost as if I were an outsider experiencing something for the first time.\n\nI was never really proud of being from Miami when I lived there, but now that I've sort of seen it as a tourist, I have a newfound pride for where I'm from.",

    "description": "Carson Beck's family isn't shy about showing their support for the Miami QB.",
    "fullText": "Carson Beck family tree: Meet sister Kylie, ex-NBA cheerleader mom and more about Florida roots originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDoes Carson Beck have a girlfriend?\n\nNot many college quarterbacks can say they had a resume the caliber of Carson Beck's.\n\nWhile both of his championships came as a backup when he played for the Georgia Bulldogs, Beck still cemented himself as a starter by 2023, when he threw for 3,941 yards and had 28 total touchdowns for Georgia. Then, Beck decided to play one last year in college, transferring to the Miami Hurricanes for a reported hefty NIL package.\n\nThose around Beck have been in the spotlight often, from his past relationship with Miami women's basketball star Hanna Cavinder, to his family, including his mom and sister.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of Beck's family tree.\n\nMORE: Why did Carson Beck transfer from Georgia to Miami?\n\nCarson Beck's sister is Kylie Beck. She is a former cheerleader and member of the dance team at Georgia, where she attended at the same time as her brother.\n\nWhen the quarterback departed Georgia for Miami, Kylie Beck, a sophomore at the time, also shared that she was leaving the Bulldogs behind. It hasn't been confirmed whether she also chose to attend Miami, but she's remained a close supporter of her brother with the Hurricanes.\n\n“Thank you letter to Athens. When one door closes, another door always opens with something greater on the other side,\" Beck wrote, per The Athlete Lifestyle on SI. \"I entered this new city hoping for greatness, success and happiness. Although there are times there was an abundance of these things, there were also times when I was at the lowest I’ve ever been and my family and I went through the hardest things we’ve ever dealt with. To say this experience has been a whirlwind of emotions would be an understatement.\n\nI am thankful that I’ve been able to call Athens my home for the past five years, traveling to games to support my brother and then making my dream a reality this past year when i was awarded the opportunity to be both a Georgette & Dance Dawg. It was such a blessing being by my brothers side and cheering him on from the field.\"\n\nLike Carson, Kylie is from Jacksonville, Florida, so the quarterback's transfer to Miami was closer to their home state.\n\nWhether as a Georgia cheerleader or just as a fan, Kylie has been a very vocal supporter of her brother's football career. She's shared plenty of social media posts about Carson.\n\nKylie Beck has also become known for her gameday outfits.\n\nKylie Beck is not a cheerleader for the Dallas Cowboys. However, she was invited to dance with the Cowboys cheerleaders in March 2025, posing on the field afterward.\n\nMORE: How does NIL money work in college football?\n\nCarson Beck's mom is Tracy Beck. She grew up in Clinton, Md., went to Maryland for college and danced for the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards) in the past, per The Athletic. Tracy Beck is a kindergarten teacher at Alimacani Elementary School in Jacksonville, Florida, where her kids were raised.\n\nLike the rest of Carson's family, Tracy has been a very public supporter of the quarterback's career.\n\nIn 2024, she told The Athletic that it's not \"who Carson is\" to remain in college as long as he had because of NIL.\n\n“There was no negotiating for money. That’s not who Kirby is. That’s not who this program is about, and that’s not who Carson is,” she said. “I think it’s cool he can do NIL this year and have an opportunity for all that. And those boys work so hard. I have never seen kids work as hard as they do. I mean it’s a full-time job to be a football player at the University of Georgia.\"\n\nHowever, Tracy also told The Athletic that she supports Carson's decision to buy a luxury car with his NIL money, as he's been focused on football first.\n\n“He’s so laid back and so focused on football and Georgia and his team. To him, that’s such a cool thing and be able to represent and do things for Georgia and for NIL,” she said. “But at the end of the day, talking about the car, it’s just a car. It’s very cool and amazing that he can drive something like that. But at the end of the day, it’s more about the team and coming back to try and do what they want to do this year.”\n\n\"Beck's Brigade\" is a gameday tailgate support group for Carson Beck that was started by his mother. Per Dawg Nation, Tracy Beck previously said watching Carson play always makes her nervous.\n\n“Honestly, he tells me to relax,” she said, per Dawg Nation. “I promise you that. He says ‘Don’t be nervous’ and ‘Be calm’ and ‘I’ve got this’ and ‘Tell everybody around you to not be nervous’ because it is nerve-wracking to be the quarterback’s mom and anybody’s mom.\n\n“Now some games have been close and I’ll cry at the end when we win and I’ll go out on the field.”\n\nMORE: Ranking the 19 greatest Miami players of all time\n\nCarson Beck's dad is Chris Beck. He is a former player at Navy, where he played linebacker from 1989-92, and he is now a retired Naval officer.\n\nWhen Carson Beck played for the Pablo Creek Saints, his dad was his coach, per the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nMORE:Carson Beck's tattoos, explained\n\nNo, Carson Beck's parents are no longer married.\n\nIt's unknown when Chris and Tracy Beck divorced, but according to EssentiallySports, the couple met in Annapolis, Maryland, before later moving to Florida and welcoming Carson in 2002, then Kylie.\n\nMORE:History of Miami QBs in the NFL, from Jim Kelly to Cam Ward\n\nAs of January 2026, Carson Beck hasn't been confirmed to be in a relationship with anyone.\n\nPreviously, he was in a high-profile relationship with Hanna Cavinder, a basketball player at Miami and popular social media influencer. Beck and Cavinder began dating in July 2024, per People, but rumors that they had split began in March 2025, not too long after Beck transferred to Miami and joined his girlfriend as a Hurricanes athlete.\n\nAt the time, per People, Cavinder had removed all signs of Beck from her Instagram profile, while her twin sister, Haley, posted on social media suggesting she had \"a gut feeling about a relationship\" and saw \"someone in my life that's hurting.\"\n\nBeck later confirmed his split with Cavinder to ESPN, saying, \"You make mistakes as a person, but it sucks that you have to go through something like that with someone that you care about, and now it's all over the Internet.\"\n\n\"Half of what you see in the media is true,\" Beck told ESPN. \"Half of what you see is not true. So, people pick their side of the story and run with it. The people that know the truth know the truth. But it's been difficult.\"\n\nMORE: When is the last time Miami won a championship in football?\n\nCarson Beck was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. He attended Mandarin High School; in 2018, he won the Florida \"Mr. Football\" award after throwing for 3,546 yards and 30 touchdowns as a junior.\n\nBeck led Mandarin to a state championship, and after initially committing to Florida as a baseball prospect, he switched to college football. Beck first committed to Alabama, then flipped his decision to Georgia and joined the Bulldogs in 2020.\n\nHas Carson Beck won a championship?",

    "description": "South Florida potentially finds its first QB of the Brian Hartline era. Van Buren arrives with 12 starts.",
    "fullText": "2026 represents a new chapter for South Florida football, as the Bulls flip from the Alex Golesh era to the Brian Hartline era.\n\nSouth Florida lost three-year starter Byrum Brown in the transfer portal, as the star dual-threat quarterback followed Golesh to Auburn. In return, the Bulls received a quarterback with substantial starting experience in the SEC.\n\nSouth Florida received a commitment on Wednesday, Jan. 7 from quarterback Michael Van Buren Jr., who suited up at Mississippi State in 2024 and LSU in 2025. Van Buren arrives with 12 games of starting experience, serving the majority of the 2024 campaign as the Bulldogs’ first-string QB and taking over as the Tigers’ starter during the last quarter and change of 2025.\n\nAs a true freshman in 2024, Van Buren threw for 1,886 yards, 11 touchdowns, and seven interceptions on a 54.7 completion rate. He collected 300 passing yards in two games that year, notably firing for 306 yards and three touchdowns in a 41-31 track meet defeat at Georgia.\n\nVan Buren transferred to LSU in December 2024, entering the year as the backup to Garrett Nussmeier. He ultimately took over as the Tigers’ primary quarterback on Nov. 8 against Alabama and retained the starting role for the final four games. He captained victories over Arkansas and WKU and nearly guided LSU to a major upset over a CFP-bound Oklahoma squad. Van Buren earned his last start in purple and gold in the Texas Bowl vs. Houston, where he exhibited some of his best work to date. He accumulated 267 passing yards, three touchdowns, and zero interceptions on a 16-of-26 showing, guiding LSU to 35 points in a narrow defeat — when LSU never surpassed 25 against an FBS opponent in the regular season.\n\nVan Buren’s mobility also improved as a true sophomore, racking up 129 yards on the season (105 in his four starts). The Bowie, MD native rattled off a 15+ yard carry in all four starts — a helpful trait if South Florida wants a similar style QB to Byrum Brown.\n\nSpeaking of Brown, Van Buren enters Tampa with massive shoes to fill. Brown is the only quarterback in USF history to surpass 3,000 passing yards in a season, and he did it twice. Brown just set the record for most passing touchdowns in a season by any Bull by 28, and he left the program ranked third all-time in rushing yards at 2,265.\n\nVan Buren takes over as a potential starter under Hartline and his new staff, as the former SEC quarterback takes on his third different school in a three-year span.",

    "description": "Growing up in Fort Lauderdale and moving to New York City has taught me that the cities we dream of won't always meet our expectations, and that's OK.",
    "fullText": "For nearly 20 years of my life, I lived in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe beaches, palm trees, and Pub Subs (sub sandwiches from Publix, for those unfamiliar) that were part of other people's vacations were staples of my everyday life.\n\nMaybe that's why I started yearning for somewhere that wasn't as calm and steady as I was used to — somewhere like New York City.\n\nI visited NYC for the first time in 2016, and four visits later, I made it my goal to live there one day.\n\nEach trip welcomed me with new experiences and places to explore. Getting to walk out of my hotel with no set itinerary and discover local coffee shops or pocket parks was a feeling I genuinely believed couldn't be replicated elsewhere.\n\nUnlike my days in Florida, which sometimes felt repetitive, New York always felt fresh.\n\nSo, in July, I made the leap and moved to the Big Apple. Like other transplants in their early 20s, I wanted to feel like I was living in a place that mattered, and the city's energy was intoxicating.\n\nDay by day, since moving to New York City, I've become more aware of the realities that come with actually living in the place I dreamed of.\n\nAs a tourist, I curated my experiences, planned my trips around perfect weather, and was able to appreciate a slowed-down version of the city.\n\nBut living in the city comes with a pace that's impossible to ignore.\n\nPublic transportation is crowded, fast-paced, and something I've learned to take into account when planning my days. I've had to learn to make decisions faster, leave earlier than necessary, and accept that even the smallest disruptions can throw off my entire day.\n\nPlus, the so-called \"New York tax\" that forces me to spend at least $30 the moment I walk out the door has been a humbling dose of reality.\n\nMoments like schlepping groceries in bad weather have made me miss how South Florida provides more space to slow down, too.\n\nI used to see New York City as a fantasy, but as a resident, I'm realizing that maybe that was the version I created for the \"me\" who was just passing through.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still see New York City's appeal — just not in the ways I used to. In the same way tourists flock to the beaches I grew up on, I now see NYC as a destination people project their biggest hopes onto.\n\nAfter months of living here, I've come to realize that the mundane aspects of everyday life are what make the city feel like home, from catching an express train just before it leaves the station to waving to my building's super.\n\nAnd now, I'm able to take these lessons home to Fort Lauderdale when I visit, which I've come to see in a whole new light.\n\nOn my first trip home, the beaches I used to visit every other month, and the constant hot weather I'd tried to avoid, carried a sense of charm I had really never appreciated growing up.\n\nExperiencing it from the perspective of someone who left made me feel grateful for all the little details I used to overlook.\n\nAfter that visit, I finally understood: A place can lose its appeal once it becomes familiar, but that doesn't mean it's no longer special. A dream city may never truly live up to the images we create of it, and that's OK.\n\nI'm learning to love New York's imperfections and am enjoying rediscovering the beauty of South Florida as well.\n\nBut moreover, I'm learning to accept that home doesn't have to be a place that constantly amazes me. It's where I choose to keep building, flaws and all — and for now, that place is New York City.",

    "description": "I never thought I'd find my forever home in the Midwest, but I fell in love with a small, affordable town in Wisconsin that I love more than Florida.",
    "fullText": "After growing up in North Carolina, I moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, at the age of 18 for college. That's where I fell in love with my now-fiancée — and the surrounding Pinellas County.\n\nWe both adored Florida's beaches, took regular weekend trips to Key West and Manasota Key, and thoroughly enjoyed life in the Tampa Bay area.\n\nAt times, I thought we might just stay there forever — but after graduation, the world felt wide open. So, we started \"shopping around\" the country for a new place to call home.\n\nMy partner and I packed up my truck and started our adventure by road-tripping across the Western United States.\n\nWe camped in the Badlands, swam in the Yellowstone River, slept in a canyon in Idaho, and in 2020, landed in Portland, Oregon.\n\nPortland was the epitome of cool — the kind of place where you could hike in the morning, grab a craft beer at night, and feel like you were living the hipster dream.\n\nHowever, after six months, I found myself struggling with poor air quality from local wildfires and missing the familiarity of St. Pete.\n\nSo, we moved back to Florida, hoping to relive our college days with close friends and potentially settle down.\n\nHowever, my fiancée and I struggled to put down roots.\n\nPinellas County and its housing market had undergone significant changes while we'd been away. Homes were selling for significantly more than they had been a few years ago, and many of those prices were far beyond our budget.\n\nThe rental market remained competitive as ever, too. We ended up renting a 400-square-foot ADU in the area for about $1,100 a month. At the time, it was the only place we found within our budget that had in-unit laundry and a decent location.\n\nWe made it work, and I even became friends with my landlord and his wife. However, heavy rain routinely flooded part of the unit, and after one particularly severe hurricane, the carpet was so soaked it had to be removed.\n\nBetween the worsening storms and rising house (and insurance) prices in the area, the idea of buying our first home here felt increasingly unrealistic.\n\nWe'd already been spooked by Hurricane Irma in 2017, and this felt like a small taste of the possible issues to come if we stayed.\n\nFortunately, by this point, I had a solid remote job, and we'd been building up our savings to put toward a down payment on a house.\n\nNow, we had to figure out where to go next.\n\nMy fiancée suggested we move to southern Wisconsin, near where her family lived. Real estate was cheaper there, and we could stay with her parents while house-hunting.\n\nI agreed, we moved, and we're still happily here years later.\n\nOur lives immediately felt different in a southern Wisconsin county with a population of about 100,000, in a town of less than 10,000.\n\nAfter living in one of the most densely populated counties in Florida, home to nearly 1 million people, I was thrilled to find a quieter place to call home.\n\nI've also fallen in love with the Wisconsin outdoors and all the adventures it has to offer. I've hiked Kettle Moraine State Forest, surfed on Lake Michigan, tested new fishing holes, and explored the lakes I'd only heard about before moving.\n\nThe locals seemed to welcome us instantly, and the community feels rich and full of life — new businesses always seem to be opening: a huge coffee shop, a speakeasy bar, and even a high-end restaurant.\n\nPlus, the local \"lake life\" offered the same laid-back vibe we used to enjoy finding around Florida's beaches.\n\nSoon, we bought a four-bedroom house in the area, securing a mortgage that costs us less than $1,500 a month.\n\nIn less than a year, we'd gone from living in someone else's tiny suite to having our very own four-bedroom home for a comparable monthly cost. We could hardly believe it.\n\nSure, winters can be a lot colder and tougher out in the Midwest, and we sometimes miss Florida, but I like the life we've built.\n\nI always say if the hipsters in Portland or the beach bums in Florida knew about small-town Wisconsin, they'd move here in a heartbeat (or at least visit in the summers).",

    "description": "Florida is adding depth to the defensive line. Baylor DL transfer DK Kalu committed to the Gators on Monday.",
    "fullText": "Former Baylor redshirt sophomore defensive tackle DK Kalu has committed to the Florida Gators.\n\nKalu announced his decision on Monday, Jan. 5, joining former teammate DJ Coleman in moving from Baylor to Florida. A consensus three-star prospect out of high school, Kalu redshirted in 2023 after not seeing any action as a true freshman. He played three games as a reserve defensive lineman in 2024, making one start and recording one solo tackle.\n\nIn 2025, Kalu played 281 total snaps, earning a 59.7 offensive grade, a 61.5 run-defense grade, a 68.4 tackling grade (49th among Big 12 defensive linemen) and a 54.0 pass-rushing grade from Pro Football Focus. He played in nine games, starting six, recording 11 total tackles (four solo) and 0.5 tackles for a loss.\n\n247Sports ranks Kalu No. 705 overall and No. 48 among defensive linemen in the 2026 transfer cycle. On3 has him at No. 684 and No. 75, respectively.\n\nHe was on campus this weekend for an official visit.\n\nCommitted 🐊 pic.twitter.com/WU9S8wrBkV\n\n— DK Kalu🇳🇬🤴🏿 (@dk_kalu) January 5, 2026\n\nFollowing transfer portal losses, including starter Michai Boireau, the Gators have five defensive linemen in 2026. Redshirt senior Jamari Lyons has starting potential, as does redshirt junior Brendan Bett. Kalu is a depth addition, but he will compete for a starting job. Florida also returns Joseph Mbatchou and Jeramiah McCloud, and freshman Kendall Guervil recently signed as well.\n\nThe dilemma is that Boireau primarily played nose tackle for Florida last year, which none of the names mentioned above have much experience at. Lyons could step into that role, opening the door for Bett and Kalu to rotate alongside him. Florida could also add another defensive lineman from the transfer portal.\n\nAt 6-foot-4-inches, 309 pounds, Kalu provides size and depth to the position room.\n\nKalu is the fourth official transfer portal addition of the 2026 cycle for Florida, following Baylor safety DJ Coleman, James Madison tight end Lacota Dippre and Georgia Tech wide receiver Bailey Stockton.\n\nFlorida is also expected to land Georgia Tech quarterback Aaron Philo and interior offensive lineman Harrison Moore.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida Gators football earns commitment from Baylor DT DK Kalu",

    "description": "After moving from West Virginia to Miami in South Florida a few years ago, I've fallen in love with the great weather and budget travel deals.",
    "fullText": "Throughout my childhood, my family barely strayed from the parts of West Virginia's Appalachia region where I was born and raised.\n\nI spent college two hours away in Ohio, and during those years, I started traveling around the United States and to more distant places in Europe and Latin America.\n\nI love exploring the world, so when it was time to graduate and start a life somewhere new, I applied to jobs all around the country.\n\nI took the first one I could get, and it happened to be in Miami. I'd never been to Florida before, but I quickly found things in Dade County I enjoyed.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of living here, there are three big things I love about living in Miami — and one thing I still miss about West Virginia.\n\nA lot of people have opinions about this one, but as someone who grew up in a colder climate, I much prefer Miami weather.\n\nSummer aside, most weeks are sunny and fairly comfortable with a lot of days between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are pleasantly short, sunny, and warm.\n\nI also struggle with depression, which can be impacted by the seasons, so having the ability to go outside and get some sunshine any time of the year is a major bonus for me.\n\nThough summertime in Miami can be uncomfortably hot and humid and hurricane season is no joke, I still prefer the weather here to any place that experiences a harsher winter.\n\nAs a travel writer, I'm constantly booking trips and visiting new cities and countries. And when I'm not hopping on a plane or road tripping to a different part of Florida, I can still experience a variety of communities and cultures in Miami.\n\nMost people know Miami for its Cuban influence, but the city is also home to a huge variety of expats from other parts of Latin America, like Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina.\n\nThere's also a lot of diversity from other parts of the world, too. For example, Miami Beach has one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel, and there's also a huge variety of Bahamian, Jamaican and other Caribbean cultures here.\n\nMiami is constantly growing and changing, and I love that I can learn about so many different cultures without traveling too far.\n\nOne of my favorite perks of living in Miami truly is how easy and convenient it is to travel from the city.\n\nFor starters, there are two major airports nearby — Miami International Airport (MIA) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL).\n\nMiami is also the cruise capital of the world, and there are constantly ships sailing from the ports in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nI'm a budget traveler at heart, and I've scored some incredible travel deals from South Florida. I regularly find flights to Europe for less than $400 from these airports, and I can fly to many places around the US for less than $150.\n\nSince I moved to Florida, I've developed a deep appreciation for the beach. However, I still definitely miss the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nThey're the oldest mountain range in the United States, and these rolling hills are the perfect place for exploring. My favorite time to visit West Virginia is in the late spring or early summer when the trees are at their fullest and brightest.\n\nPalm trees are beautiful, but I definitely miss how serene and peaceful nature can be in West Virginia — especially when compared to how busy and chaotic Miami can feel sometimes.",

    "fullText": "Florida football landed a Power 4 conference quarterback out of the transfer portal, securing a commitment Georgia Tech quarterback Aaron Philo, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo brings dual threat ability and familiarity with the scheme under new Florida Gators offensive coordinator Buster Faulkner, who was his offensive coordinator at Georgia Tech for the last two seasons. He visited UF over the weekend along with teammate and wide receiver Bailey Stockwell.\n\nA redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining, the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo showed promise as a backup quarterback in two seasons with the Yellow Jackets, throwing for 938 yards with 2 TDs to 3 interceptions over two seasons while rushing for 95 yards and 1 TD. Philo has appeared in seven games over two seasons and while alternating with starter Haynes King, helped lead Georgia Tech to a 28-23 upset win over Miami on Nov. 9, 2024.\n\nA three-star recruit out of Prince Andrew Christian School in Bogart, Ga., Philo broke Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence's high school record for passing yards in the state of Georgia with 13,922 yards during his prep career.\n\nPhilo will compete with redshirt freshman Tramel Jones Jr. for the starting quarterback job at Florida. Jones, who announced his intention to return to UF in December, completed 21 of 35 passes for 191 yards and 2 TDs in two games as former UF quarterback DJ Lagway's backup last season. Florida also brings back redshirt sophomore quarterback Aidan Warner and adds incoming four-star freshman quarterback Will Griffin, who plans to enroll at UF this month for the spring semester.\n\nPhilo joins Baylor safety DJ Coleman as the second commitment in UF's 2026 transfer portal class.\n\nKevin Brockway is The Gainesville Sun’s Florida beat writer.

Exceptions exist for coaching changes (a 15-day window that starts five days after the new coach is hired) and CFP playoff participants who play on or after January 12 (five days after final game to enter the portal).\n\nThe spring football transfer window has been eliminated, leaving football with one offseason period for all transfer activity.\n\nThis is a solid article to read about the

    "description": "Cynthia Diekema, 61, was killed by an alligator while on a canoe ride with her husband in Florida last year",
    "fullText": "Cynthia Diekema, 61, was canoeing with her husband last year when they crashed into an alligator in their canoe and both fell into the water, according to a report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission recently obtained by PEOPLE\n\nThroughout the attack, he said that his wife seemed alert, but unable to speak and had a \"puzzled look on her face\"\n\nHer cause of death was listed as “multiple blunt force injuries from an alligator,\" according to the report.\n\nNew details have emerged about an alligator attack that claimed the life of a 61-year-old woman as her husband fought to save her life.\n\nOn May 6, around 4:02 p.m. local time, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission responded to an alligator encounter near the mouth of Tiger Creek in Polk County.\n\nThe woman, later identified as Cynthia Diekema, was canoeing with her husband when they encountered the reptile and both fell into the water, the FWC later shared.\n\nThe 11-foot, 4-inch alligator then bit Cynthia and pulled her into the water before she was \"later found deceased.\"\n\nNearly eight months after the attack, an incident summary report from the FWC, which was obtained by PEOPLE via a public records request, revealed additional information about what happened on that horrifying day.\n\nIn a sworn statement to authorities, David Diekema, Cynthia’s husband, said that he and his wife were traveling on an 11-foot plastic canoe that departed earlier that day from Lake Kissimmee State Park.\n\nOnce they entered the shallow waters of Tiger Creek, David says that they observed numerous alligators — and right before the attack, his wife commented on how they were \"about to go right over top of one,\" according to the report.\n\nAs the canoe crashed into the animal, which was resting on the bottom of the creek, the startled animal began to thrash, according to the report, which caused the canoe to capsize and sent the couple into the water.\n\nWhen he was able to stand up, David said he saw Cynthia’s torso in the alligator’s mouth.\n\nAccording to officials, he said he \"attempted to free her from the alligator's mouth for several minutes,\" but was unsuccessful.\n\nThroughout the ordeal, he said that his wife seemed alert, but unable to speak and had a \"puzzled look on her face.\"\n\nAt one point, the alligator whipped its tail, knocking David off of his feet, according to the report. During that time, he also said the alligator \"momentarily released\" his wife before biting her again on the shoulder.\n\nAfter regaining his balance, he tried once again to free his wife from the alligator's mouth, however the alligator then \"conducted a death roll and immediately swam away with Mrs. Diekema in its mouth.\"\n\nKnowing that time was of the essence, David — who lost his phone during the ordeal — bailed as much water as he could from the canoe and paddled north of Tiger Creek until he reached Lake Kissimmee, per the report. There he was rescued by a good Samaritan in an airboat.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into their search, the FWC recovered Cynthia's body and EMS pronounced her dead at the scene. The alligator was captured and euthanized around 7:30 p.m. local time that same day.\n\nA coroner later performed an autopsy and shared their findings with the FWC, detailing numerous injuries, including the amputation of her right arm below the shoulder.\n\nThey stated that the preliminary cause of Cynthia’s death was “multiple blunt force injuries from an alligator” and the manner of death was ruled as an “accident,\" according to the report.\n\nThe day after the incident, investigators returned to the scene to find any other alligators that were involved in the attack and to capture those that are potentially dangerous in the Tiger Creek area. One alligator was dispatched by an officer and moved onto an airboat bound for Kissimmee Park. No other gators were located.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“The FWC extends its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the victim during this difficult time,” the department said in a previous statement.\n\nCynthia was from Paw Paw, Mich., and is survived by her husband David, two children and two grandchildren, per her obituary.\n\n\"She radiated her inner and outer beauty in all she did and had unconditional love for everyone,\" the obituary read. \"She cherished her family and every moment and adventure they spent together.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reportedly ordered his motorcade to stop at a Florida strip mall Friday morning so he could purchase supplies for his $400 million White House ballroom.\n\nWhite House pool reports said the presidential motorcade “arrived at a shopping center in Lake Worth, Florida at 9:46 AM” so Trump could go “shopping at Arc Stone & Tile,” an importer of Italian marble.\n\nWhen pressed, a White House official said that the president “is purchasing lake and onyx, at his own expense, for the White House ballroom.”\n\nAlthough he may pay for the materials himself, conservative publication The New Republic pointed out that the president was shopping for his construction project “on the taxpayer’s dime.”\n\n“Trump has brought his longtime obsession with marble to his second term, pushing for it to appear just about everywhere,” TNR reported, noting that Trump “redid the bathroom in the White House Lincoln Suite entirely in marble, and he has proposed marble armrests for the Kennedy Center, claiming it would be ‘unlike anything ever done or seen before!'”\n\nTrump proudly shared photos of the Lincoln bathroom’s marble makeover replete with gold fixtures, writing on Truth Social in October that the “art deco green tile style” used in the 1940s “was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era.”\n\n“I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble,” Trump continued. “This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n\nTrump’s ballroom construction program came under fire immediately after he began tearing down the entire East Wing of the White House. The president initially said the ballroom would cost around $200 million, before revising it to $400 million. Trump has said the ballroom is completely privately funded.\n\nTrump has been staying at his private Florida club at Mar-a-Lago for New Year’s Eve celebrations. He also met there with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe post Trump’s Motorcade Reportedly Stops At a ‘Random’ FL Strip Mall So He Could Buy Marble For His Ballroom Project first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Florida is targeting the top cornerback in the transfer portal, Jontez Williams, and will host him on a visit next week.",
    "fullText": "Cornerback Jontez Williams, the top player at his position in the 2026 transfer cycle, will visit with the Florida Gators on Thursday, Jan. 8, according to On3's Hayes Fawcett.\n\nBoth Gators Online and Swamp247 have confirmed the report. The former Iowa State Cyclone is also set to visit Notre Dame (Jan. 5-6) and USC (Jan. 3). Penn State remains a possibility as well, should Williams desire to follow his former head coach, Matt Campbell, to Happy Valley.\n\nA Florida native, Williams grew up playing high school ball 40 minutes away from the University of Florida at Bradford High in Starke.\n\n247Sports ranks him No. 34 overall and No. 1 among cornerbacks in the 2026 transfer portal cycle, while On3 has him at No. 14 and No. 1, respectively.\n\nA three-star recruit out of high school, according to 247sports and Rivals, Williams spent his first two seasons at Iowa State developing into an all-conference defensive back. He redshirted in 2022 after seeing no action and played in 13 games (two starts) in 2023. He finished his redshirt freshman year with six tackles (two solo) and three pass breakups.\n\nThe 2024 campaign saw Williams break out, starting 12 of 14 games for the Cyclones. He finished sixth on the team with 46 tackles (nine solo) and was tied for third in the Big 12 with four interceptions. He also recorded nine pass deflections and two tackles for a loss. He was named to the All-Big 12 Second Team by the coaches that year.\n\nWilliams' 2025 season was cut short after five games due to a torn ACL in his right knee. He ended the year with 15 tackles and one interception.\n\nThe Orange and Blue are losing Devin Moore to graduation and both Jamroc Grimsley and Teddy Foster to the transfer portal, leaving seven cornerbacks on the roster.\n\nRising juniors Dijon Johnson and Cormani McClain are the most veteran returners and are expected to start, followed by rising sophomore J'Vari Flowers and rising redshirt freshmen Ben Hanks III and Onis Konanbanny. Florida added a pair of four-star recruits, CJ Bronaugh and CJ Hester, during the early signing period.\n\nWilliams would likely step in as the top player in the position room, should he choose Florida.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida football hosting transfer CB Jontez Williams on visit",

'cause TMZ has learned Franky Venegas was arrested again in Florida for alleged drug-related offenses and is currently behind bars.\n\nLaw enforcement tells us Franky was booked into the Collier County Jail in Naples Wednesday night on one count of drug paraphernalia, posing for a fresh mug shot ... face tattoos and all.\n\nWe're told Franky has no bond, as he's being held on a 24-hour hold because he's already out on bond from a February arrest for delivering/possessing/selling a firearm with an altered serial number.\n\nWe broke the story ... Franky was arrested in February on drug and firearm charges. The drug count was dropped, but the firearm charge stuck, and that's the case he's currently out on bond for.\n\nAccording to the February sheriff's report, officers stopped a yellow Corvette after it allegedly ran a stop sign. Cops say a baggie of suspected Oxycodone was found on the passenger side floorboard. Venegas denied ownership, claiming he had a prescription he didn't have with him.\n\nAt the time, police also found a brown \"MGM\" handbag containing a blue spray painted handgun with no serial numbers, a cut straw, and credit cards in Venegas' name. Another straw with a white powdery substance was allegedly found in the center console.\n\nFranky rose to fame in 2021 with brother Alex after their viral hit, \"I'm an Island Boy.\"\n\nHe's previously been arrested for domestic battery, reckless driving, and driving without a license.",

    "description": "As a Florida resident of over 25 years, I think there are several tourist spots worth visiting. However, others aren't quite worth the trip.",
    "fullText": "World-famous theme parks, stunning beaches, and natural beauty are just a few of the many reasons tourists flock to Florida every year.\n\nAfter living in the Sunshine State for over 25 years, I've explored just about every major tourist spot there is. In my experience, some absolutely live up to the hype, but others aren't worth your time or money.\n\nHere are the six tourist attractions worth visiting and the two you might want to skip on your next trip to Florida.\n\nA vibrant city with an artsy, laid-back vibe, St. Petersburg is a cultural hot spot on Florida's Gulf Coast. The downtown area is filled with colorful murals, markets, and great dining options.\n\nI recommend visiting the St. Pete Pier for beautiful waterfront views and great restaurants. Plan on arriving in the late afternoon to catch the stunning sunset.\n\nWhether you're a lifelong fan or new to the magic of the Harry Potter universe, the level of immersion in the Universal Orlando parks is unlike anything else I've ever experienced.\n\nSplit between Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida and Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure, the attractions bring this magical world to life with incredible detail.\n\nFrom sipping Butterbeer to riding Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, there's magic at every turn. The Hogwarts Express connects both lands, making park-to-park tickets a must for the full experience.\n\nA hidden gem located about 70 miles west of Key West, Dry Tortugas National Park is one of Florida's most remote and stunning destinations.\n\nIt's home to Fort Jefferson, a 19th-century coastal fort surrounded by crystal-clear waters that are perfect for snorkeling.\n\nThe park is only accessible by ferry or seaplane, making it a true off-the-grid getaway. I recommend booking a ride on the Yankee Freedom III ferry or a spot on a seaplane tour well in advance, as space fills up quickly.\n\nWynwood Walls in Miami is a vibrant outdoor street-art museum that provides an explosion of color and creativity.\n\nLocated in Miami's artsy Wynwood neighborhood, the area features massive, changing murals created by artists from around the world.\n\nBeyond the walls, you can find art galleries, shops, and some of Miami's trendiest restaurants.\n\nI suggest grabbing a drink at Panther Coffee or stopping for dinner at Bakan, known for its unique and authentic Mexican cuisine — some of which feature insects.\n\nThe Everglades are more than just a swamp — they're a massive, incredibly diverse ecosystem home to alligators, manatees, and stunning bird species.\n\nI recommend visiting Everglades National Park for an airboat tour. For a quieter experience, you can also get out on a kayak to explore the park up close.\n\nThe Florida panhandle's beaches, including Pensacola, Santa Rosa Beach, and the scenic 30A stretch, have some of the softest, whitest sand I've ever seen.\n\nThis area is perfect for those looking for a mix of relaxation and outdoor fun.\n\nDestin, which is home to clear emerald waters, is one of our family's favorite destinations. I recommend visiting in late spring or early fall to enjoy the warm weather without the summer crowds.\n\nInternational Drive is a shopping and entertainment area in downtown Orlando. Although it's home to a few decent spots like Icon Park and the Orlando Premium Outlets, a lot of I-Drive feels like a tourist trap.\n\nIf you're in Orlando, I recommend heading to Disney Springs instead for shopping, dining, and entertainment. You'll get a taste of Disney magic without needing a park ticket.\n\nSouth Beach is an iconic area in Miami, but unless you're there to party, it can be more of a headache than a highlight. In my experience, the food and drinks are pricey, the beaches are crowded, and parking can be difficult.\n\nI think there are better beaches and neighborhoods in Miami that offer a more enjoyable experience (especially if you're traveling with family or kids).\n\nFor example, I recommend checking out Crandon Park Beach for a more peaceful and scenic Miami experience.\n\nThis story was originally published on April 22, 2025, and most recently updated on December 31, 2025.",

    "description": "There are still over 500,000 tires left in the reef.",
    "fullText": "The Osborne Reef is an artificial reef project situated off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It was one of many attempts in the 1970s and 80s to mimic the environmental benefits of coral reefs using old tires, but it has become an environmental disaster.\n\nIn the years since, several groups — including the U.S. military — have attempted to clean it up.\n\nIn the 1970s, a local nonprofit created the Osborne Reef by dropping more than two million tires into Florida's coastal waters in an attempt to create an environment where marine life would thrive.\n\nThe project generated a lot of buzz. It was approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the dumping operation was supervised by a U.S. Navy minesweeper. Goodyear, which provided many of the tires, even christened the reef by dropping a gold-plated tire into the ocean from the Goodyear Blimp.\n\nIn the years to follow, many of the tires — which were held together only with nylon rope and steel clips — came loose, making the \"reef\" useless as a habitat and, in some cases, damaging real coral reefs nearby.\n\nOver the past two decades, groups both public and private have launched programs to remove the remaining Osborne Reef tires from the ocean.\n\nNow, the company 4ocean is making the Osborne Reef cleanup one of its core missions.\n\n\"Ultimately, the well-intentioned project failed,\" 4ocean wrote in an Instagram post sharing eerie photos of the reef. \"And now 4ocean is stepping in to clean them up!\"\n\n\"This operation is an uphill battle,\" the organization continued. \"While there's been much cleanup progress since the first photo was captured, there's still over 500,000 tires left sitting at the bottom of the ocean. We definitely have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nTo fund its cleanup efforts, 4ocean is even selling jewelry made from tires pulled from the seafloor.\n\nThe Florida Department of Environmental Protection continues to monitor the situation as well, through its Osborne Reef Waste Tire Removal Project.\n\nBut cleanup efforts are still slow-going. The state estimated that there were 650,000 tires remaining in 2016, and 4ocean estimates that there were still over 500,000 as of 2022. In May 2023, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed off on an assessment from the Department of Environmental Protection to detail the condition of the reef, as reported by Florida Politics. That report, which would include an estimated timeline for the completion of the cleanup, is due by July 2024.\n\n4ocean's sustainable, circular model of selling products made from salvaged debris in order to fund further cleanup efforts could provide a blueprint for the treatment of other failed artificial reefs, from Malaysia to France.\n\nThe company notes that many of the tires it finds are beyond any recycling use, but it takes those tires to Florida's Solid Waste Authority, \"one of the most advanced, efficient, and [low-pollution] waste management facilities in the United States.\"\n\nAccording to its website, 4ocean's ultimate goal \"is to partner with organizations that can help us recycle these scrap tires on a massive scale so we can use more of this material to create new products that fund this historic cleanup operation and advance our mission to end the ocean plastic crisis.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and cool tips that make it easy to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "fullText": "Along with the sudden shutdowns of commercial airlines including Play and Blue Islands, a number of charter and fractional carriers also filed for bankruptcy in 2025.\n\nFlorida-based Verijet and Montana charter carrier Corporate Air both initiated bankruptcy proceedings at the same time in October, while Alaska-based Kenai Aviation followed just a few weeks later with a total shutdown of operations in November.\n\nThe charter airline connected hubs like Anchorage and Fairbanks with smaller communities in Kenai, Homer, and Seward.\n\n\"We need capital, we need partners, we need a lifeline,\" owner Joel Caldwell wrote in November. \"That investor is out there, we just need to find them.\"\n\nThe latest airline to submit a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing is Greensboro-based Jet It. Although the carrier once running charter and fractional flights has not operated since shutting down all operations in 2023, the Dec. 24 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware is a final step in a story that ultimately ends in liquidation.\n\nContrary to a Chapter 11 filing with intent to restructure, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy asks a judge to skip that step and go straight to liquidation. The filing shows that the airline, which launched in 2022 by selling fractional ownership to HondaJet flights, ran up more than $36.2 million in liabilities, including $9.7 million in unsecured claims.\n\nA fractional airline operates by selling shares to a private jet. These are doled out by giving customers a set number of hours they can use to request flights run by the airline's crew.\n\nAt the time it launched, Jet It advertised rates of $1,600 an hour while operating more than 18,000 flight hours a year. Despite the airline once being the 12th-largest private jet operator in the U.S., Jet It also ran up significant debts, given the high cost of jet fuel and a customer base that petered out over time.\n\nThe largest creditor remains World Fuel Services, to which Jet It owes $735,695, according to the filing. American Express is owed over $600,000, while smaller creditors include PIC Card Services LLC and Jetex Flight Services.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway unit FlightSafety claims it was never paid $400,981 for pilot training services enlisted by the airline.\n\nMajor airline launches surprising flight between Las Vegas and Paris\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nThe highest rooftop in Barcelona is in a surprising place\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "fullText": "MIAMI (AP) — U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick reiterated her innocence Monday outside a Miami federal courthouse, where she faces charges of conspiring to steal $5 million in federal COVID-19 disaster funds.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick was scheduled to be arraigned, but her attorney requested the proceeding be rescheduled to Jan. 20 so that she could finalize her legal team. Prosecutors didn't object, and Judge Lisette Reid agreed to the new date. The hearing lasted less than five minutes.\n\n“I just want to make it very clear that I am innocent,” Cherfilus-McCormick said immediately after leaving court. “In no way did I steal any kind of funds. I'm committed to the people of Florida and my district.”\n\nCherfilus-McCormick, a Democrat, has pleaded not guilty. She is facing 15 federal counts that accuse her of stealing funds that had been overpaid to her family's health care company, Trinity Healthcare Services, in 2021. The company had a contract to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick's attorney, David Oscar Markus, said the case involves mistakes that generally aren't even misdemeanors, let alone felonies. He said he believes the case is politically motivated.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick was arrested in November and then freed on a $60,000 bond. In addition to bail, the judge said Cherfilus-McCormick must surrender her personal passport, and is allowed to travel only between Florida, Washington, D.C., Maryland and the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nShe has been allowed to retain her congressional passport so she can perform certain duties for her job.\n\nAccording to the federal indictment, prosecutors said that within two months of receiving the funds in 2021, more than $100,000 had been spent on a 3-carat yellow diamond ring for the congresswoman.\n\nThe health care company owned by Cherfilus-McCormick's family had received payments through a COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract, the indictment said. Her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, requested $50,000, but they mistakenly received $5 million and didn't return the difference.\n\nProsecutors said the funds received by Trinity Healthcare were distributed to various accounts, including to friends and relatives who then donated to Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign for Congress.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick won a special election in January 2022 to represent Florida’s 20th District, which includes parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021.\n\nThe charges she faces include theft of government funds; making and receiving straw donor contributions; aiding and assisting a false and fraudulent statement on a tax return; money laundering, as well as conspiracy charges associated with each of those counts.\n\nAccording to a previous statement provided by Cherfilus-McCormick's chief of staff, she doesn't plan to resign from office. She said she has cooperated with “every lawful request” and will continue to do so until the matter is resolved.",

    "description": "The owner of the house and her family have four cars, so they spill slightly onto the lawn when parked—which is where the town takes issue.",
    "fullText": "Parking in a driveway is about as mundane as parking can get. It's not as fancy as in a garage. It's not as potentially dangerous as parking on a street. And yet, in this story, it's led to a six-figure fine that the Florida Supreme Court has decided to let stand after several years of litigation.\n\nWhile the state's Supreme Court didn't endorse the fine, according to CBS News, it declined to review the case of Sandy Martinez, a single mother who has spent several years fighting fines that have now ballooned to $165,000 and counting. Over $100,000 of those fines relate directly to Ms. Martinez parking her cars on her driveway and slightly onto her grass. Her home isn't home to her alone; her son, daughter, and sister all live with her. All four of them have full-time jobs, and each of them has their own car. The house itself is on a corner lot, so street parking isn't available. As such, they line their cars up across the four-car driveway.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the four cars always ends up having to park slightly onto the grass in the yard that Martinez owns. According to the city of Lantana, that's unacceptable, and as a result it has fined her $250 a day for over a year.\n\nThe Institute for Justice has stepped in, and is representing Martinez. “Six-figure fines for parking on your own property are shocking,” IJ senior attorney Ari Bargil told CBS News, following the court’s decision not to take up the case. “The court’s refusal to hear Sandy’s case is a disservice to all Floridians.”\n\nFor Martinez, options moving forward are extremely limited. CBS News says Florida's Homestead Protection Act shields her from foreclosure, but it's destroyed the equity she'd built up in her home. She can't retry the case in Florida either, and given the Supreme Court's ruling, it's unlikely that a federal court would hear the case.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States is offering Ukraine security guarantees for a period of 15 years as part of a proposed peace plan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, though he said he would prefer an American commitment of up to 50 years to deter Russia from further attempts to seize its neighbor’s land by force.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump hosted Zelenskyy at his Florida resort on Sunday and insisted that Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace settlement.\n\nNegotiators are still searching for a breakthrough on key issues, however, including whose forces withdraw from where and the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the 10 biggest in the world. Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.\n\n“Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,” Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.\n\nUkraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDetails of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the “presence” of partners. He didn’t elaborate, but Russia has said it won’t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv’s allies will meet in Paris in early January to “finalize each country’s concrete contributions” to the security guarantees.\n\nTrump said he would consider extending U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.\n\nHowever, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "The offseason is underway for Florida State, with changes to both the Seminoles’ roster and staff taking place over the coming weeks after a second-straight losing season.\n\nWith an overhaul of the entire Florida State infrastructure having been proposed in last month’s announcement confirming the retention of head coach Mike Norvell, changes to the FSU coaching staff have been underway, with the Seminoles having seen running backs coach David Johnson, quarterbacks coach Tony Tokarz and general manager Darrick Yray depart for jobs at other programs while defensive backs coach Pat Surtain Jr. was dismissed.\n\nSo far, FSU has hired a new running backs coach (Kam Martin), defensive ends coach (Nick Williams) and defensive backs coach (Blue Adams).\n\nLast season, FSU hired six coaches to its staff — offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn, defensive coordinator Tony White, offensive line coach Herb Hand, safeties coach Evan Cooper, wide receivers coach Tim Harris Jr. and defensive line coach Terrance Knighton — with defensive ends coach John Papuchis moving to linebackers (while still retaining special teams duties) and longtime defensive tackle coach Odell Haggins retaining his associate head coach title but transitioning to an off-field role.\n\nWe’ll be tracking the changes as they come in, as well as any other news of note from the coaching staff.\n\nDecember 27: FSU has hired John Garrett as its new general manager.\n\nThe Seminoles are hiring Taylor Edwards as Executive Director of Player Acquisitions.\n\nDecember 18: After Brandon Harris opted to head to Gainesville, Florida State has found its new defensive backs coach in Blue Adams, who has served in the same role at Michigan State.\n\nFlorida State is promoting from within to replace Tony Tokarz, with assistant wide receivers coach Austin Tucker set to fill the role:\n\nFSU grad assistant Ben Miles, son of Les, has been hired by Southern as its tight ends coach and recruiting coordinator:\n\nFlorida State graduate assistant Ben Miles is set to be hired as Marshall Faulk’s tight ends coach and recruiting coordinator at Southern, a source tells @CBSSports.\n\nA return to Baton Rouge for the son of former LSU head coach Les Miles.

As a South Georgia kid, you grow up wanting to be a Florida State Seminole. I remember going to Doak Campbell Stadium with my dad and how electrifying that experience was. My dad raised me that either you’re a liability or you’re an asset, and all I want to do is be an asset for Florida State. I get to come home and do what I love to do. You can’t ask for a better situation than that, and I’m looking forward to doing my part to help get Florida State back among the elite programs in America.”\n\nGeneral manager Darrick Yray is leaving to take the same position at UCLA:\n\nDecember 10: FSU is hiring UCF’s Brandon Harris as its new cornerbacks coach, per 247Sports:\n\nThe Seminoles are also set to hire Tulsa’s Kam Martin to coach running backs:\n\nDecember 8: Florida State has hired Syracuse edges coach Nick Williams to the same position:\n\nArkansas is making a move to hire David “YAC” Johnson:\n\nDecember 7: Defensive analyst Zach Arnett has been hired as the defensive coordinator at Mississippi State — from the official release:\n\nMississippi State football head coach Jeff Lebby has named Zach Arnett the Bulldogs’ defensive coordinator, returning one of the nation’s most productive defensive minds to Starkville.

    "description": "I moved across the world for my husband and ended up a single mom. Years later, I met the love of my life when I least expected it.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-one years ago, I faced the difficult decision to move from Spain to the United States with my 3-year-old daughter and 4-month-old baby to follow my then-husband, who had lost his job, in pursuit of a new position in Florida.\n\nI was being asked to leave behind my family, friends, and an established writing career. I was to start over at 41, with no connections, no guarantees, and an already shaky marriage.\n\nMy family thought it was a terrible idea, yet my husband's family felt it was a great opportunity. So, after some soul-searching and many promises of a better life in Florida, I decided to uproot my kids and take the chance.\n\nAs I boarded the plane to meet my children's father (he had come to the US ahead of us), I had mixed feelings: I could feel the excitement of my eldest to see her dad again, but I also feared the unknown. I kept asking myself whether it was really possible that we could fix our marriage and thrive in a different country.\n\nGoing from living in a penthouse in the old part of Sevilla, where I could walk to just about everywhere, to being cooped up in a tiny apartment in a gated community in suburban Florida, where I needed a car to go anywhere, was brutal to my nervous system.\n\nI felt trapped in suburbia without my own car. And with a history of major depressive disorder, I started having panic attacks and depressive episodes. One day, while driving my children to find a preschool for my eldest, I had to pull over to sob.\n\nA few months later, my husband lost the job we had moved to Florida for. And so began one of the most difficult periods of our lives.\n\nIn four years, we moved several times within Florida, always because of his new jobs. I found work freelancing for newspapers and magazines and wrote more books for publishers in Spain. But our relationship was always floundering.\n\nAs our marriage crumbled, we took a time-out under the same roof. We went to marriage counseling, enrolled in self-improvement seminars, and so on. Trust, respect, and admiration had been completely lost, and in 2008, when the Great Recession hit, we had no money, no savings, and no jobs.\n\nI walked away from my husband with my laptop, my books, joint custody of our children, and the huge regret of having moved so far away from my family and friends. But I stayed in Florida, because I didn't want my children to be far from their father. From one day to the next, I found myself a single mother on food stamps.\n\nNearly a year after separating, 16 years ago, I met the love of my life. We had many similarities: we were both newly single, bilingual and bicultural, and had children of a similar age. We were writers focused on creating a better life for our kids and ourselves. The best part was that neither of us had given up on love despite the tough times we'd lived through.\n\nFor nearly two years, we dated long-distance, spending only weekends and holidays together. One of us would drive two hours to meet the other, sometimes with the children, and when the kids were with our respective former spouses, we met alone.\n\nWe were both trying to rebuild ourselves personally and professionally, and together we made a great team. I once again moved for love, but this time with no regrets. Four years later, we married at sunset on the beach, surrounded by our children and close family.\n\nOur kids are all in their 20s now, and we've been through the highest highs as well as some pretty rough times. But our relationship was never in question. We've cheered each other on and thrived together.\n\nWhenever I think of past regrets and how I shouldn't have moved to the US 21 years ago with my ex, I realize I would have missed out on finding true love. And I would never have built the stable and dependable family I always wanted.",

    "fullText": "Despite a three-game win streak going into the Christmas break, the Florida Gators continue to drop in the ESPN College Basketball Power Index.\n\nLast ranked No. 11 following a win over George Washington, Florida fell one spot to No. 12 after decisive wins over Saint Francis and Colgate — both considered Quadrant 4 matchups by the NET rankings.\n\nThe Gators have a 19.0 overall BPI, up from 18.5 on Dec. 16. The offense improved to 8.8 (20th) from 8.0 (24th), while the Florida defense dipped to 10.2 (T-10th) from 10.3 (8th) in that time. ESPN projects Florida to go 21.5-9.5 overall — a 0.5-game increase — and 12.5-5.5 in conference play, a 0.4-game improvement.\n\n“The College Basketball Power Index (BPI) is a measure of team strength that is meant to be the best predictor of performance going forward,” ESPN explains. “BPI represents how many points above or below average a team is. Strength of Record (SOR) is a measure of team accomplishment based on how difficult a team’s W-L record is to achieve. Game predictions account for opponent strength, pace of play, site, travel distance, day’s rest and altitude, and are used to simulate the season 10,000 times to produce season projections.”\n\nFlorida remains the favorite to win the SEC, with 41% odds — up from 38.2% chance last week. The Vanderbilt Commodores (29%) and Tennessee Volunteers (21.3%) have the next best odds to win the conference, followed by Alabama Crimson Tide (15%) and Kentucky (14%). No other SEC team has better than a 4.4% chance to win the conference.\n\nFlorida's remaining strength of schedule is now 24th in the country, up from 44th before a three-game stretch against Quadrant 4 opponents. Florida still has Dartmouth on the schedule, and then it's all SEC from there. The Gators' strength of schedule (to date) ranks fifth in the country, while the non-conference slate ranks sixth nationally.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida Gators basketball ESPN BPI rankings Dec. 26",

    "description": "Steven Carroll and his son spent weekends flying JetBlue for a challenge that once sent them from New York to DC to Florida and back all in one day.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Steve Carroll, a New York-based nurse practitioner who chased JetBlue's \"25 for 25\" challenge to earn 350,000 points and Mosaic status for 25 years by flying to 25 unique cities by December 31. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBreakfast in Massachusetts, lunch in DC, dinner in Orlando, and back home by midnight. That was one of the epic days that my 10-year-old son and I flew for JetBlue Airways' \"25 for 25\" challenge.\n\nIt was thrilling to plan and execute these trips, with layovers so tight we sometimes barely had time for a bathroom break. Finding a flourishing community chasing this challenge was one of the best parts.\n\nThe promotion, created for JetBlue's 25th anniversary, is simple: Fly to 25 unique cities in the airline's network between June 25 and December 31, and you'll earn Mosaic 1 status for 25 years plus a lump sum of 350,000 points.\n\nThere are some rules: You must connect your loyalty number to each flight; basic fares don't qualify; flights must be operated by JetBlue (not its partners, such as Cape Air); and only arrival airports count.\n\nStill, I realized it could be an unforgettable experience for my son Jackson and I. He already loves JetBlue (I think the TV screens do it for him), and his 100th and 200th flights ever were on JetBlue.\n\nPlus, Mosaic status until age 35 means he and his friends could enjoy the perks — like free bags, complimentary drinks, dedicated security and check-in, early boarding, and seat upgrades — on future spring break or summer trips in college. (Editor's note: You must be a Mosaic  3 member or higher to receive complimentary Mint upgrades and a Mosaic 4 for lounge access when JetBlue's open in late 2025.)\n\nThe math also checked out. Completing the challenge earned each of us a reward of 350,000 points, at least $3,500 in travel apiece, plus the additional points earned from our flights.\n\nCombining the cash I paid plus the 100,000 JetBlue points I already had, the whole challenge cost around $7,000, but I was essentially reimbursed in points.\n\nI started the challenge already holding Mosaic, but securing long-term status now gives me more freedom to put everyday spending on other cards and build points with brands like Hyatt via Chase.\n\nJetBlue's new partnership with United Airlines also means I can tap into reciprocal benefits on United — an attractive perk since we live close to the airline's Newark, New Jersey, base.\n\nTo maximize our time, we mostly flew on weekends and sometimes took up to five flights across a Saturday or Sunday. We took closer to 35 flights overall because of the overlap at some departure and connecting airports.\n\nOur flights stretched west to Los Angeles, north to Portland, Maine, and south to Fort Lauderdale. We've also checked off airports like Cleveland, Norfolk, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Manchester in New Hampshire, Raleigh in North Carolina, and Buffalo in New York.\n\nOur most ambitious weekend was over Veterans Day in November, when we planned 18 flights and 11 new cities. The government shutdown, however, canceled five of them, but we managed to rebook and still add several new destinations.\n\nAside from those cancellations and a huge delay that forced us to postpone a trip, the challenge has been remarkably smooth. And we've met a great community of people also clamoring for 25 years of Mosaic status.\n\nWe recently flew in Mint business class to Los Angeles as our 23rd city and completed the challenge on December 8 in Fort Myers, with about three weeks to spare.\n\nI already had a few JetBlue trips on my calendar to start, but then I created a master list of airports in the Northeast along with their city pairs. I live just north of New York City.\n\nThe goal was to create snaking routes that efficiently hopscotch across the US; we're trying to avoid international flying. I'd sit up in bed when I couldn't sleep and just map out my options.\n\nOver time, I've figured out a few tricks: book one-ways, sit near the front, and choose the first and last flights of the day. Most fares averaged about $100 per person.\n\nI have lounge access that made longer layovers easier, though I occasionally booked \"illegal\" itineraries with very tight connections. Connecting airports, regardless of the time spent there, count as unique destinations.\n\nBut before I risked it, I checked the historical arrival times. One trip I planned included a 12-minute layover at New York-JFK, but we still made it because our flight from Hyannis, Massachusetts, landed half an hour early, as expected.\n\nWeather-tracking helped, too. I adjusted my flight if I anticipated a disruption, which my status allows me to do for free. An unofficial tool called \"25for25.ai\" was also helpful; you can plug in your starting point and block destinations you've already hit.\n\nLiving in the New York area made the challenge far more doable. Airports, like White Plains, LaGuardia, Newark, New York-JFK, and Islip on Long Island, are all considered separate, unique cities.\n\nNew York-JFK and Newark are especially useful since they offer so many connections. There's also Hartford, Connecticut, and Philadelphia nearby. That's seven of the 25 we just drove to.\n\nSmaller airports like Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts require more creativity because they offer limited frequencies.\n\nOne of our biggest travel days began in White Plains, New York, where we flew to Nantucket and had breakfast in town. We then headed to DC for lunch at the airport, and finally to Orlando for dinner, also at the airport.\n\nMy partner joined us on that trip, making it a family day in the skies. We crossed paths with about 15 other challengers on our legs to DC.\n\nWhat was extremely helpful was the dedicated Mosaic Facebook group, where other participants in the challenge shared routes and road warrior stories. It's not hosted by JetBlue.\n\nThe challenge fostered a vibrant and supportive community. (Editor's note: JetBlue told Business Insider that over 500 people have completed the promotion so far.)\n\nMy son and I sometimes saw other challengers on our flights and ate lunch together in the airport between legs. We helped a family of four explore the town during our layover in Nantucket.\n\nWe exchanged numbers with almost every person we met so we can stay in touch. I didn't expect to find such a large and enthusiastic community, but it was one of the best parts of the challenge.\n\nI have a little tag on my bag that somebody made for me that says 'JetBlue 25 for 25.' When people saw it, they were like, 'Oh, you're doing the challenge.'\n\nIt was nice getting help along the way, and I appreciate being able to help others, too, as we cheered them on to finish by the holidays.",

    "fullText": "A Florida man is suing a major steakhouse chain after one of the restaurant’s toilets “shattered” while he was using it.\n\nMichael Green said in a lawsuit that the incident unfolded during a visit to an Outback Steakhouse in Ocala on March 26.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed by law firm Dan Newlin Injury Attorneys, alleges that Green left his table to use a handicapped stall during his meal. That was when the seat collapsed beneath him, causing him to fall to the ground.\n\nGreen’s lawsuit, which was seen by Ocala News, claims that he suffered “significant and permanent loss of an important bodily function and/or permanent and significant scarring” as a result of his injuries.\n\nNow, he is suing the Australian-themed chain of steakhouses for damages in excess of $50,000. He has also accused the company of negligence on the basis that it failed to “ensure the toilet was secured to the floor.”\n\nOutback Steakhouse has more than 1,000 locations across the world, 670 of which are in the United States, according to its quarterly report.\n\nFounded in 1988, the Tampa-based company is known for its “bloomin’ onions.” The deep-fried dish consists of an onion cut to resemble a flower and is often served with the brand’s dipping sauce.\n\nHowever, like many restaurant chains, the brand has been forced to close several of its locations as part of a “turnaround plan.”\n\nTwo of the sites that have closed are based in Alabama, with another two being located in Florida. Locations in Maryland, Louisiana, New York and Wisconsin were also closed as part of the plan.\n\nOutback Steakhouse is operated by parent company Bloomin’ Brands which confirmed the news in a statement given to USA Today.\n\n\"We considered a variety of factors, including sales and traffic, trade areas, and potential investments to improve performance,\" Elizabeth Daly, the company’s spokesperson, wrote.\n\nThe wave of closures comes just months after 41 “underperforming” restaurants were shuttered by Bloomin’ Brands in February.\n\nEmployees at the axed locations were offered jobs at nearby restaurants if possible.\n\n“Closing restaurants is never easy,\" Bloomin' Brands said in a statement at the time. \"This was a business decision that has no reflection on the staff or their service.\n\n“Many team members will have the opportunity to transfer to open positions at another restaurant,” the statement continued. “Employees who do not will receive severance.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted Bloomin’ Brands and Dan Newlin Injury Attorneys.",

    "fullText": "A Florida man shot and killed his wife and shot his stepdaughter earlier this week before fatally shooting himself after an argument over an NFL game, authorities said.\n\nJason Kenney, 47, took his own life hours after killing his wife, Crystal Kenney, Dec. 22, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a press conference.\n\nJudd said the murder occurred after Crystal Kenney suggested to her husband that he turn off Monday’s NFL game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nFlorida Man Facing Death Penalty For Killing 18-Year-old Girlfriend, Unborn Child After She Refused Abortion\n\nJason Kenney had been drinking, and the argument escalated, prompting his wife to tell her 12-year-old son to call 911.\n\nThe boy ran to a neighbor’s home when he heard gunshots. Responding deputies found Crystal Kenney dead and a 13-year-old girl who had been shot in the shoulder and face.\n\nShe is recovering in a hospital.\n\n\"She said, ‘I begged him, don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me, don’t shoot me, and he shot me anyway,’\" Judd said.\n\nArkansas Mom Found Shot To Death With Two Children Wrote Cryptic Facebook Post Months Before Killings\n\nThe boy was unharmed, as was Jason and Crystal’s 1-year-old daughter, who was home at the time of the shooting. She was found by deputies asleep in her crib.\n\nAfter the shooting, Jason Kenney fled and called his sister, who lives in upstate New York, Judd said. He told her he had \"done something\" wrong and that it would be the last time they would talk.\n\nHe then drove to his father’s home, where deputies found him. As deputies attempted to get him out of a shed, Jason fatally shot himself, Judd said.\n\nDuring a search of the family’s home, deputies found a note Crystal wrote to her husband urging him to get help.\n\n\"You’re drinking, you’re using cocaine again. This is not the way the family should be. You need God,\" the note states, Judd said.\n\nThe surviving children are in the custody of grandparents.\n\n\"The entire family was destroyed,\" Judd said. \"Our homicide detectives are distraught. When you go in there, there is a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of Christmas presents under it, just like the nuclear family should be.\"\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "Everyone knows that the LSU Tigers are going to be in the market for a quarterback this offseason, the only question is which one.\n\nMatt Mascona, of LouisianaSports.net, reported that the Tigers have made contact with the reps of former Florida Gators star DJ Lagway. That immediately solidifies Lagway’s position on the list of possibilities for next year.\n\nLane Kiffin and his staff must come away with a new option at quarterback next year. The only scholarship player at the position on the roster is Michael Van Buren Jr.\n\nWhile Van Buren showed flashes over the last few weeks when he took over for Garrett Nussmeier, but not enough to warrant going into next season with him as the only option.\n\nKiffin is likely to go big game hunting for one of the top names available.\n\nThe most obvious observation to make is bringing over Trinidad Chambliss from the Ole Miss Rebels, but he’s not guaranteed another year of eligibility.\n\nArizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt was another top option, coming off a down year but still carrying hopes of having an NFL career. Working with Kiffin could secure that.\n\nIf it does come down to Lagway as the choice, it would be an exciting outcome for LSU. He may not have had the best start to his career with the Gators, but he’s still a high potential player.\n\nLagway was the top high school passer in a class that included stars like Julian Sayin, Dylan Raiola and CJ Carr. He’s now one of the top options in the portal.\n\nThe Texas native has completed 63.2% of his passes for 4,179 yards with 28 touchdowns and 23 interceptions over his two seasons in Florida.\n\nHe’ll have great games and make impressive throws, but no consistency has been developed. It wouldn’t be crazy to think that Kiffin and his staff could unlock something that the failed Gators crew couldn’t.",

    "fullText": "The future of high school football is here, and it’s burning bright. From California to Florida, Texas to Pennsylvania, gridiron stars have performed all across the country the past few months to electrify on Friday nights. We’re unveiling our Sophomore All-American list – the names you need to know now, because you’ll be hearing about them all throughout the off-season and into 2026. These athletes aren’t just talented; they’re the game-changers from this past 2025 high school football campaign.\n\nQB: Lukas Prock, Hun School\nWe’d be hard pressed to not have Prock heading up this list as the country’s top quarterback when you look at production, talent and competition he faced in 2025. The 6-foot-2, 180-pound quarterback went up against the likes of teams in Archbishop Spalding (Md.), The St. James Academy (Md.), St. Frances Academy (Md.), The First Academy and IMG Academy. The signal caller finished the season completing 226 of 309 passes for 4,330 yards and 41 touchdowns.\n\nRB: Xander Edwards, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nEdwards had himself a breakout season playing for the FHSAA Class 2A state semifinalist Bolles bulldogs. The sophomore running back averaged a ridiculous 9.9 yards per carry and rushed for 2,629 and scored 44 times on the ground. Add in his 17 catches for 211 yards and Edwards finishes just shy of 3,000 all-purpose yards for the 2025 season.\n\nRB: Zaiden Jernigan, Louisville (MS)\nJernigan made his name well known throughout the Magnolia State this past 2025 season as the running back put up some of the top numbers of any back in the country when it came to sophomores. The running back rushed for 1,563 yards on 238 carries and scored 20 touchdowns. The sophomore also added 205 yards and four touchdowns out of the backfield.\n\nWR: Roye Oliver, Hamilton (Ariz.)\nOliver was as good as advertised anytime he took the field for Hamilton, finishing the season catching 92 passes for 1,839 yards and scoring 29 touchdowns. There’s little doubt that Oliver is one of the country’s best wide receivers, regardless of class as he proved himself this 2025 campaign.\n\nWR: Brysen Wright, Mandarin (Fla.)\nThe four-star do-everything has done it all just about for Mandarin this past season, with Wright catching 46 passes for 983 yards and 10 touchdowns. Wright has also seen plenty of time on the defensive side of the ball as well, notching 63 tackles and intercepting five passes. The sophomore also contributed in the punt return game, totaling 254 yards on six returns.\n\nWR: Eric McFarland, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nThough McFarland reclassified to the Class of 2027, he was considered a sophomore throughout the entire 2025 high school football season. McFarland has shown his versatility not only going downfield, but also on jet sweeps, pop passes and even just taking hand-offs. Through nine games, McFarland caught 29 passes for 595 yards and scored 11 touchdowns.\n\nOT: R’Monie Edwards, Cypress Ranch (TX)\nAt 6-foot-5, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle was near impossible to get by for opposing defensive ends down in the Lone Star State. Rated a four-star by the Rivals Industry Rankings, Edwards led the way up front for over 4,500 all-purpose yards, 58 touchdowns and 463 points scored in 2025.\n\nOL: Elisha Mueller, Servite (Calif.)\nPlaying up against some of the top high school football programs in the land, Mueller held his own and then some for the Friars. Mueller is interchangeable at either guard position and led the way for Servite’s offense that totaled over 3,500 all-purpose yards and 39 touchdowns.\n\nC: Hunter Hill, Peach County (Ga.)\nHill can play center or at either guard position as he did during the 2025 season for the 10-2 Peach County Trojans. The 6-foot-3, 305-pound interior offensive lineman was superb in Year 2 and helped the Trojans amass 4,500-plus yards of offense and scoring 58 total touchdowns.\n\nOL: George Selvie III, Sumner (Fla.)\nFamiliar with the name? That’s because his father, George Selvie, starred at USF and eventually in the NFL. Now the younger Selvie plays for his father at Sumner and has blossomed into one of the top offensive linemen in the country when it comes to sophomores. Selvie III paved the way for over 3,800 yards and 45 touchdowns for the Class 7A region finalist Stingrays.\n\nOT: Jamarios Canton, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nProtecting the right side of Jayden Wade on Friday nights, Canton proved anytime out on the field that he was the top offensive tackle of the 2028 class. At 6-foot-4, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle took on all comers and right out of the gates against Hoover (Ala.) was pancaking opposing defensive linemen.\n\nAll-Purpose: Gaige Weddle, Rancho Bernardo (Calif.)\nI mean, what didn’t Weddle do for Rancho Bernardo in 2025? The dual-threat quarterback threw for 2,224 yards and 19 touchdowns through the air. Weddle led the team in rushing with 679 yards on just 98 attempts and 10 scores. Oh and Weddle also led the team on defense with 101 tackles, two sacks and two interceptions. Like we said, what didn’t Weddle do? He was what you want in a all-purpose athlete.\n\nEdge: Asher Ghioto, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nNo matter where Ghioto lined up on the defensive line, the 6-foot-5, 240-pound EDGE rusher was causing havoc for opposing offensive linemen. Ghioto finished the season totaling 84 tackles, 35 for a loss and 23 sacks.\n\nDT: Kellan Hall, Christian Academy of Louisville (KY)\nAnchoring the Centurions’ defensive line all throughout their undefeated 15-0 run to the KHSAA Class 3A state championship. Hall recently received defensive first-team all-state honors playing on the defensive line. When it comes to interior defensive linemen, there’s very few as agile and quick like the 6-foot-4, 255-pound stalwart.\n\nDT: Cory Cunningham, Providence (N.C.)\nThe four-star 6-foot-4, 265-pound defensive tackle was a force in North Carolina’s Class 8A throughout the season. Cunningham was unblockable for many opposing offensive linemen as the defensive tackle racked up 60 tackles, 28 going for a loss and 15 quarterback takedowns.\n\nEdge: Jackson Vaughn, Bergen Catholic (N.J.)\nJust because the numbers might’ve went down a little from his freshman campaign doesn’t mean that Vaughn didn’t remain a factor when it came to EDGE rushers. Teams took notice and Vaughn faced plenty of double and even triple teams. The edge rusher compiled 40 tackles, 12 for a loss and eight sacks.\n\nOLB: Judah Blair, Lakota West (OH)\nBlair at 6-foot-1, 200 pounds moves like a safety, but can hit you like a ton of bricks like a linebacker. The sophomore backer had a strong year in the linebacking corps for Lakota West, tallying 57 tackles, 15.5 going for a loss, three sacks and an interception.\n\nLB: Tahj Gray, St. Joseph Regional (N.J.)\nThe sophomore linebacker proved himself on the highest level of of New Jersey high school football, helping the St. Joseph Regional Green Knights win the NJSIAA Non-Public A state championship. Gray last season ended with 102 total tackles, 10.5 for a loss, four sacks and four passes broken up.\n\nLB: Nehemiah McCary, Maplesville (Ala.)\nMcCrary was a two-way force for Maplesville this past season as the Red Devils went on to win Alabama’s Class 1A state championship. The 6-foot-2, 225-pound linebacker’s performance in the state title game came on the offensive end of the ball where McCrary rushed for 182 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nCB: A’mir Sears, West Broward (Fla.)\nOne of the biggest reasons why West Broward made it all the way to Florida’s Class 6A state championship game was the play of the four-star athlete. Sears was dynamic on both sides of the ball, with the sophomore making 61 tackles, breaking up 11 passes and intercepting three others. On offense, Sears led the Bobcats with 942 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nCB: Langston Pridgeon, Stone Bridge (Va.)\nMany opposing quarterbacks thought twice before throwing to Pridgeon’s side of the field in 2025. Ranked as one of the top cornerbacks in the country, Pridgeon proved himself to being one of Virginia’s best players in the Bulldogs’ defensive secondary. Whether its playing in man or zone coverages, the sophomore excelled in his sophomore campaign.\n\nS: Casey Barner, McEachern (Ga.)\nHonestly, Barner could’ve been put at a multitude of spots on this list but his natural position is at safety and there was little doubt of his talents from the moment he stepped onto the field this season. In McEachern’s season-opening win 50-17 win over Walton, Barner compiled 341 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns.\n\nS: Giovanni Tuggle, Winder-Barrow (Ga.)\nIt’s an all-Georgia safety duo with Tuggle paired with Barner in the first team defensive backfield. Tuggle saw extensive playing time for the Bulldogs this past 2025 season as the four-star safety totaled 74 tackles, five pass breakups and also intercepted four others.\n\nPK: Jack Ciancio, Phenix City Central (Ala.)\nThe sophomore kicker was automatic when it came to extra points for the Phenix City Red Devils this past season, knocking down all 75 of his attempts. Ciancio connected on 11 field goals, with a long of 38 yards.\n\nP: Israel Carmona, Queen Creek (Ariz.)\nPlacing punts inside of an opponent’s 20-yard line was a specialty of Carmona’s this past season as the sophomore pinned teams deep into their own territory 17 times. On 39 punt attempts, Carmona averaged 40.6 yards with a long of 58 on the season.\n\nReturn Specialist: Tyree Mannings, Venice (Fla.)\nMannings was superb stepping into the No. 1 receiver role at Venice after Winston Watkins Jr. graduated and had built a strong connection with Howard quarterback commit Darryon Jones. The Indians’ top wide receiver hauled in 84 passes for 1,429 yards and 12 touchdowns. Mannings was deadly in the kick return game, compiling 335 return yards for the Indians.\n\nQB: Koa Malau’ulu, St. John Bosco (Calif.)\nRB: Taihj Moore, Deland (Fla.)\nRB: Kameron Battle, Carrollwood Day (Fla.)\nWR: Jaylen Addai, Shadow Creek (TX)\nWR: Jett Harrison, St. Joseph’s Prep (Pa.)\nWR: TJ Maddox, Winslow Township (N.J.)\nOT: Bryce Smalls, Archbishop Spalding (Md.)\nOL: Kris Scott, Taft (OH)\nC: Carl Noisette, Duluth (Ga.)\nOL: Maxx Jones, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nOT: Azhir Waddell, Dudley (N.C.)\nAll-Purpose: Deandre Bidden, Harper Woods (Mich.)\n\nEdge: Jalanie George, Desert Edge (Ariz.)\nDT: Kingston Brown, Carver (Ga.) \nDT: Jameer Whyce, Trotwood-Madison (OH)\nEdge: Darieon Prescott, Bolingbrook (IL)\nLB: Tysir Young, Middletown (DE)\nLB: Brayden Bonik, Ridge Point (TX)\nCB: Man Robinson, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nCB: Jermaine Cobbins, Springfield (Tenn.)\nS: Pole Moala, Leuzinger (Calif.)\nS: James Foster III, Lancaster (TX)\n\nPK: Luke Marchionni, Hamilton Southeastern (IN)\nP: Julian Trujillo, Eaglecrest (CO)\nReturn Specialist: Dillon Mitchell, C.E.

    "description": "President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"  “They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.  According to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"\n\n“They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nAccording to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.\n\nThe announcement comes just a month after the Navy scrapped its plans to build a new, small warship, citing growing delays and cost overruns, deciding instead to go with a modified version of a Coast Guard cutter that was being produced until recently. The sea service has also failed to build its other newly designed ships, like the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget.\n\nMeanwhile, the Navy has struggled to field some of the technologies Trump says will be aboard the new ship.\n\nThe Navy spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 15 years trying to field a railgun aboard a ship before finally abandoning the effort in 2021.\n\nLaser technology has seen more success in making its way onto Navy ships in recent years, but its employment is still limited. One system that is designed to blind or disable drone sensors is now aboard eight destroyers after spending eight years in development.\n\nDeveloping nuclear cruise missile capabilities or deploying them on ships may also violate non-proliferation treaties that the U.S. has signed with Russia.\n\nA U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing plans, told The Associated Press that design efforts are now underway for the new ship and construction is planned to begin in the early 2030s.\n\nBoth Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically that term has referred to a very specific type of ship — a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.\n\nThis type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the U.S. battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tons. But after World War II, the battleship's role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The U.S. Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned.\n\nAccording to a newly created website for the “Golden Fleet,” this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships but only weigh about half as much, around 35,000 tons, and have far smaller crews — between 650 and 850 sailors.\n\nIts primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.\n\nTrump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy’s fleet, sometimes with a view toward keeping older technology instead of modernizing.\n\nDuring his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy’s newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.\n\nHe has also complained to Phelan about the look of the Navy’s destroyers and decried Navy ships being covered in rust.\n\nPhelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump \"has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one (o’clock) in the morning” about “rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it.”\n\nOn a visit to a shipyard that was working on the now-canceled Constellation-class frigate in 2020, Trump said he personally changed the design of the ship.\n\n“I looked at it, I said, ‘That’s a terrible-looking ship, let’s make it beautiful,’” Trump said at the time.\n\nHe said Monday he will have a direct role in designing this new warship as well.\n\n“The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I’m a very aesthetic person,” Trump said.\n\nPhelan said the new USS Defiant “will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyers for former CIA Director John Brennan want the Justice Department to be prevented from steering an investigation of him and other former government officials to a “favored” judge in Florida who dismissed the classified documents case against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe request Monday is addressed to U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga, the chief judge in the Southern District of Florida, where federal prosecutors are pursuing a criminal investigation related to the U.S. government assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Brennan and other former officials have received subpoenas, and Brennan's lawyers say he's been advised by prosecutors that he's a target of the investigation.\n\nBrennan's lawyers say in their letter that they are concerned the Justice Department is engaged in “judge-shopping” and trying to arrange for the investigation to be transferred to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who issued favorable rulings to Trump during the classified documents case and dismissed it last year. They asked Altonaga to exercise her “supervisory authority” as chief judge to ensure the Justice Department is unable to steer the current Russia-related matter to her.\n\n“In short, we are seeking assurance that any litigation arising out of this grand jury proceeding will be heard by a judge who is selected by the court’s neutral and impartial processes, not by the prosecution’s self-interested maneuvering contrary to the interests of justice,” wrote Brennan's attorneys, Kenneth Wainstein and Natasha Harnwell-Davis. The New York Times earlier reported on the letter.\n\nIt remains unclear what specific allegations of criminal conduct are being examined by prosecutors in Florida. But the subpoenas issued last month to Brennan and other former law enforcement and intelligence officials sought documents related to the preparation of the Obama administration’s intelligence community assessment, made public in January 2017, that detailed how Russia waged a covert influence campaign to help Trump defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump was investigated, but not charged, during his first term over whether his campaign conspired with Russia to tip the outcome of the election. He has long sought retribution over the Russia investigation and the officials who played a key part in it.\n\nHis Justice Department in September secured a false statement and obstruction indictment against James Comey, the FBI director at the time the Russia probe was launched, though the case against him was dismissed. Its future is in doubt thanks to a judge's ruling that blocked prosecutors, in the event they try to revive the case, from relying on communications they consider to be key evidence.\n\nBrennan's lawyers say the Trump administration Justice Department tried to “forum-shop” the investigation of him to multiple jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, before settling in Florida. But they say prosecutors have been unable to answer basic questions about why Florida is a proper venue for the investigation given that the intelligence community assessment at issue was produced by officials in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nThough it is not clear that the Justice Department will ultimately produce charges, Brennan's request reflects the fact that judges who oversee grand jury investigations can be called upon to make important decisions and resolve significant disputes, including over witness testimony, that can affect the course of the inquiry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation is currently based in the Miami division of the Southern District of Florida, but Brennan's lawyers say they're concerned that the Trump administration may be poised to try to transfer the case to the smaller Fort Pierce division, where Cannon is the only judge. They cited as a basis for that alarm a Justice Department decision to seek an additional grand jury in Fort Pierce even though, Brennan's lawyers say, there's no apparent caseload need.\n\n“The United States Attorney’s efforts to funnel this investigation to the judge who issued this string of rulings that consistently favored President Trump’s positions in previous litigations should be seen for what it is,” Brennan's lawyers wrote.",

The boat they'd been using for their trip had been scheduled to return at about sunset.\n\nThe pair went out in a 42-foot Freeman boat named \"Unstopp-A-Bull,\" according to Luis Garcia, the supervisor on watch for the Coast Guard sector in St. Petersburg. The Coast Guard found the boat floating upright in the Gulf about 70 miles off the coast of Naples, with no signs of the missing boaters.\n\nNow, one of the largest searches in Southwest Florida history is underway, with a large community effort behind it.\n\nHere's what we know so far, as of noon, Sunday, Dec. 21.\n\nAs of 10 a.m. Sunday, Dec. 21, Randall Spivey and Brandon Billmaier, the Florida boaters reported missing Dec. 19 after a fishing trip off the coast of Naples, had not been found, according to Billmaier's wife, Deborah.\n\n\"Updates after speaking with the U.S. Coast Guard this morning,\" Deborah Billmaier wrote in a Facebook post Sunday. \"The EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon) was unfortunately still on the boat. They were bottom fishing when the incident occurred (still not sure exactly what occurred.)\"\n\nThe post also mentioned that a couple of life jackets were not found on the boat, indicating that Spivey and Billmaier may be wearing them.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg posted news of the search on social media Saturday morning, Dec. 20.\n\nAccording to the Facebook post, air and surface crews from the agency and partner agencies U.S. Coast Guard Station Fort Myers Beach, U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Miami and Lee County Sheriff's Office are involved in the search.\n\n\"The search effort support features an 87-foot boat on water, 45-foot boat, 60-foot helicopter, 144 plane, 6130 Air Force from Patrick Air Force Base and an 144 continuing through the day (not sure if this is a boat or a plane),\" Deborah Billmaier wrote in her post the following morning.\n\nAn urgent marine broadcast has also been issued to all vessels in the area to help expand the search range, said Billmaier.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard coordinated one of the largest search parties in Southwest Florida history Sunday morning, Dec. 21, starting at first light, according to Deborah Billmaier, wife of Brandon, Billmaier. In her Facebook post, she asked those with capable vessels to help out.\n\nFlorida Rep. Peggy Gossett-Seidman shared the post on X.\n\nErin Shaw Harrel of Facebook group SWFL Boaters urged people Saturday to take to the water to search for the missing boaters, providing these coordinates for the search: 25-51.67N 083-12.16W.\n\nBrent Stokes, owner of Stokes Marine, also asked for volunteers to help search.\n\nAccording to Stokes, anyone willing to help with the search could call Tricia Spivey at 239-896-4099 or the U.S. Coast Guard at 727-322-4180.\n\nAttorney Randall Spivey, 57, and his 33-year-old nephew Brandon Billmaier were reported missing at about 9 p.m. Friday, Dec. 19.\n\nTricia Spivey reported her husband and nephew missing Friday night, said Luis Garcia, supervisor on watch for the Coast Guard sector in St. Petersburg. “They were going to fish about 102 miles offshore.”\n\nSpivey is a white male, 6’1”, 245lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing khaki pants and a dark in color shirt, according to Lee County Sheriff's Office. Billmaier is a white male, 6’2”, 250lbs, with strawberry hair and brown eyes.\n\nThe pair went out in a 42-foot Freeman boat named \"Unstopp-A-Bull,\" Garcia said. The Coast Guard later found the boat floating upright in the Gulf about 70 miles off the coast of Naples, but no signs of the missing boaters.\n\nTricia Spivey says GPS coordinates from the boat's spot tracker led them to that location near Marco Island and Flamingo. That's where the search has been concentrated.\n\nThe Lee County Sheriff's Office requested the public's help in locating Spivey and Billmaier.\n\nIf anyone knows about the pair's whereabouts, they can call 911, if applicable, or call the sheriff's office at 477-1000.

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",

    "fullText": "Donovan Metayer was a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida when a gunman opened fire and killed 17 people on Valentine’s Day 2018.\n\nA young man who was a “radiant” child according to family and friends, has died.\n\nDonovan Joshua Leigh Metayer, 26, died on Dec. 15 by suicide. Metayer, who survived the 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, suffered from mental health episodes following the tragic incident and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The shooting occurred during Metayer’s senior year, when most students are thinking about college applications and their life after high school.\n\nBut the shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 people, had a profound effect on Metayer and stands as an example of how the trauma of gun violence can linger on for years.\n\nThe youngest child of the Metayer family, Donovan was brilliant from an early age and excelled academically. His humor, according to a GoFundMe page dedicated in his honor, could “light up any room.”\n\nIn the years following the Parkland shooting, Metayer’s dreams of attending college and working in his preferred career field of computer science began to fade. On multiple occasions, he would be hospitalized for suicidal ideation and after one mental health episode in 2021, he was Baker-acted and deemed temporarily unable to purchase a firearm.\n\nYears later, with the help of a private psychiatrist and the Henderson Clinic Metayer began making progress and healing. He’d soon work at Office Depot and earn a promotion and an IT certificate. His mental health journey echoes that of many Black boys across America, masking emotions and not wanting to be seen as a “burden” by family. Treatment, from therapy to medication, may seem like a difficult path thanks to limited resources, social stigmas and more.\n\nHowever, just as Metayer was progressing and gaining more independence according to his family, he soon learned his Risk Protective Order had lapsed.\n\nMetayer then purchased a gun from a gun shop in the area and within a week, he turned the gun on himself.\n\nIn a statement shared on his GoFundMe page, Donovan’s family wrote, ” Donny’s passing is a heartbreaking reminder of the mental health crisis plaguing our youth and the lasting trauma of gun violence on our community. As we grieve his loss, we are breaking the code of silence in his memory. Though Donny’s life was brief, his impact will be everlasting.”\n\nThe family is asking for funds to assist for Metayer’s celebration of life and endow a fund at the Henerson Clinic that will “provide healthcare, housing and hope for people of all ages with behavioral health conditions” throughout the state of Florida.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health challenges, emotional distress, substance use problems, or just needs to talk, call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org 24/7.\n\n‘They beat our brother’: New York community demands justice after video shows police beating a Black man\n\nRay J has restraining order extended following November arrest, faces 6 misdemeanor charges: ‘I’m missing my kids’\n\nDeaths of Missisippi mom Shardee McGill and 3-year-old daughter determined to be murder-suicide",

    "description": "Old Dominion collects signature win to finish best season ever, while holding the nation’s #2 offense to 10 points.",
    "fullText": "The Old Dominion Monarchs fully joined the FBS in 2014 and rapidly acclimated to the highest level of college football, producing a 10-3 record in 2016. However, through the 2024 season, that was the only winning season Old Dominion ever produced. That changed in 2025, and the program reached a new pinnacle on Wednesday night in Orlando.\n\nSixth-year head coach Ricky Rahne rattled off nine regular season wins to seal Old Dominion’s second winning record as an FBS program, and this breakout 2025 aptly concluded with a statement 24-10 upset over South Florida in the StaffDNA Cure Bowl. In the process, the Monarchs earned their biggest win in program history, adding a second bowl trophy to the shelf while tying their FBS record for wins in a season.\n\nSouth Florida entered this matchup ranked second in the FBS in points (43.0) and yards (502) per game, lighting up opponents with seven games of 48+ points. Only twice did the Bulls score fewer than 31 all season — an 18-16 win over Florida and a 49-12 defeat to playoff-bound Miami (FL). USF faced obvious obstacles with the losses of head coach Alex Golesh (to Auburn), quarterback Byrum Brown, and Keshaun Singleton, and the Bulls could not overcome those absences nor the Old Dominion defense.\n\nSouth Florida registered just 10 points, scoring one first half touchdown and facing a second half shutout to a relentless Monarch bunch. Old Dominion made its presence felt with four sacks and five takeaways, concocting a +4 in the turnover battle against one of the nation’s best turnover-producing teams. Outside linebacker Jeremy Mack totaled a game-high 11 tackles and a sack, while free safety Jerome Carter snagged two interceptions in a 3.5-hour defensive clinic by the boys from Norfolk.\n\nOld Dominion’s offense also faced some pregame adversity, as Sun Belt Offensive Player of the Year Colton Joseph opted out of the remainder of the 2025 season, thrusting Quinn Henicle into the starting quarterback spot. Henicle started and won a game in 2024 with 204 rushing yards, and the sophomore’s mobility was on full display in ODU’s massive win. He only completed 11-of-25 passes but made his presence felt on broken plays, scrambling up the middle for massive gains. Even after four sacks he rattled off 107 rushing yards and two touchdowns, delivering a 51-yard blow with 2:32 remaining to put the game out of reach. Henicle, who returned from a brief third quarter injury stemming from a targeting call, won MVP honors for his effort in Orlando.\n\nSouth Florida’s backup quarterbacks did not enjoy the same level of production as Henicle. Sixth-year senior Gaston Moore earned his first and last collegiate start at quarterback to replace Byrum Brown, and Moore finished 20-of-28 with 236 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions. He had one first half sequence where he connected with true freshman Jeremiah Koger for back-to-back 25 and 31-yard pickups — with the latter serving as USF’s lone touchdown. But there wasn’t much explosiveness in the passing game otherwise.\n\nMoore’s last throw was a notable one, and unfortunately for the longtime backup, it was his final collegiate pass. In the fourth quarter, trailing 17-10, he sent a 20-yard strike to JeyQuan Smith at the Old Dominion 14-yard line, and Smith made a spectacular diving grab. However, Moore took a brutal hit while releasing the ball that caused his head to collide with the Camping World Stadium field, ultimately knocking him out of the final 12 minutes.\n\nProtesting the hit, South Florida guard Cole Skinner and interim head coach Kevin Patrick were both assessed with 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalties. Then USF took a sack and holding on the next two plays, ultimately moving the Bulls back from the Old Dominion 14 to their own 38 — a monumental 48-yard difference. USF never even crossed the ODU 40-yard line again, as those penalties proved instrumental in the defeat.\n\nTrue freshman Locklan Hewlett, whose passing experience was limited to a 45-yard fake punt touchdown in Week 1, finished the effort for the Bulls. But on a 4th and 6 from its own 47-yard line with 3:45 remaining, South Florida made the questionable decision to run a fake punt — this time, without Hewlett disguising as a punter. Punter Chase Leon was intercepted by Jerome Carter on a play that never stood a chance, ultimately putting a dagger in USF’s hopes at a 10-win season.\n\nSpecial teams also played a significant role in this contest. Both teams missed two field goals in this game, including several attempts under 40 yards. But special teams ended up favoring Old Dominion overall as the Monarchs denied South Florida of a critical fourth quarter possession. An ODU punt hit a USF gunner two times on Wednesday evening, and on the second occurrence, Monarch long snapper Brendan Durkin made a mid-air recovery after the ball bounced off the gunner and return man.\n\nSouth Florida (9-4, 6-2 American) missed out on a golden opportunity for its first 10-win season since 2017. The Bulls enjoyed their best season in nearly a decade but it comes to a bitter end, as they will be denied a season-ending ranking — a feat the team hasn’t accomplished in eight years. The Bulls now officially move into the Brian Hartline era, as the Ohio State offensive coordinator relocates to Tampa when the Buckeyes’ playoff run is complete.\n\nOld Dominion (10-3, 6-2 Sun Belt) sealed its best season as an FBS member with a victory for the ages. Two of the three Monarch losses — Indiana and James Madison — are competing in the College Football Playoff, and they now unlock a new signature win by upending South Florida. Ricky Rahne celebrated his first bowl win as head coach, capping off an unforgettable moment in the program’s young history.",

    "fullText": "Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino is reportedly already clearing out his office ahead of an imminent departure from the Bureau and a potential return to the MAGA media circuit, the New York Times has reported.\n\nBongino has told associates he could leave “as soon as this week or as late as mid-January,” people familiar with his plans told The Times on Wednesday. He has not yet made a formal announcement.\n\nTo back the claims, however, the newspaper’s sources further revealed that Bongino has begun shipping office “knick-knacks” and other personal belongings back to Florida, where he plans to resume his broadcasting career in time for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nSources told Fox News Digital on Monday that Bongino had not made a final decision and denied his office was empty, but did add that he was expected to declare his intentions in the coming weeks.\n\nThe former podcaster arrived at the FBI this year promising disruption and ideological clarity, after President Donald Trump nominated him.\n\nHowever, the Times reported that earlier this month, Bongino floated the idea of choreographing his exit around a major law enforcement moment to associates. He allegedly said he may announce his resignation at a press conference tied to the investigation into who planted pipe bombs near Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the January 6 riots in 2021.\n\nThe newspaper added that behind-the-scenes, Bongino has also made a point of repairing relations with Attorney General Pam Bondi, whom he had accused of mishandling the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein in July.\n\nAt that time, he reportedly threatened to resign after Bondi’s department released a memo concluding that the much-hyped “Epstein client list” did not, in fact, exist – a topic that had been a focus of Bongino’s podcast before his tenure.\n\nThe post Dan Bongino Clearing Out His Office in Preparation for FBI Exit: NY Times first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The Old Dominion Monarchs (9-3) travel to Camping World Stadium for their StaffDNA Cure Bowl against the South Florida Bulls (9-3)\n\nWith both star quarterbacks opting out, my Old Dominion vs. South Florida predictions anticipate a low-scoring affair.\n\nRead on for my college football picks for Wednesday, December 17.\n\nI’m leaning toward Old Dominion to pull off the upset. The Monarchs are only missing their quarterback, but their coaching staff and defense remain intact.\n\nSouth Florida enters with far more disruption, including a new interim head coach and a reshuffled offense, making Old Dominion the more stable and reliable side.\n\nWednesday’s Cure Bowl matchup between the Old Dominion Monarchs and South Florida Bulls sets up as a lower-scoring, grind-it-out game.\n\nBoth teams enter with major question marks at quarterback, and inexperience at the position often leads to conservative play-calling, fewer explosive plays, and an emphasis on protecting the football.\n\nOld Dominion will turn to freshman Quinn Henicle, while South Florida starts journeyman Gaston Moore, an inexperienced combination that points toward the Under.\n\nDefensively, both units have proven capable of limiting points; Old Dominion allowed just 19.5 points per game during the regular season, while South Florida surrendered 23.\n\nThose are solid defensive numbers that reflect good red-zone defense and an ability to turn long, time-consuming drives into field goals.\n\nNeither defense was prone to getting gashed for quick scores during the regular season, and I don’t expect that to change with backup quarterbacks under center.\n\nThe continuity of Old Dominion’s stop unit, combined with a stout USF defense and likely ground-first approach from both offenses, should lead to a low-scoring Cure Bowl.\n\nNeither offense should score more than 24 points, especially with Old Dominion turning to Henicle after Colton Joseph opted out.\n\nSouth Florida has allowed fewer than 24 points in three of its last four games, reinforcing the case for the Under on Old Dominion’s team total.\n\nI also trust the largely intact Monarchs' defense to keep this contest within one score, allowing ODU to stay competitive and its offense to cover the number.\n\nOld Dominion team total Under 24.5\n\nSpread: Old Dominion +3.5 (-110) | South Florida -3.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Old Dominion +138 | South Florida -164\n\nOver/Under: Over 53.5 (-110) | Under 53.5 (-110)\n\nOld Dominion has hit the Game Total Under in their last five games (+5.00 Units / 91% ROI).

I didn't realize the city had two locations, and I was surprised to find out they were so close to each other.\n\nGuests of each Ritz-Carlton have access to all amenities at both locations, and a shuttle service runs between them. I was stoked because I'd never stayed at a hotel with this perk.\n\nAfter spending some time at each, I found that the resorts offered completely different experiences.\n\nWhile both were extremely luxurious, the Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón was centered on golf, while the Ritz-Carlton, Naples was on the beach. The former was quieter and seemed to cater to an older crowd, while the latter felt busier with a wide range of ages.\n\nI appreciated being able to spend the day at the bustling beach resort and retiring to the calmer Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón.\n\nI've never held a putter outside mini golf, so I wasn't expecting to be at all interested in the hotel's two courses. Then I learned that they host three pro tournaments every year, according to the company's website.\n\nEven though golf isn't my thing, I instantly got excited for guests who love it. As a baseball fan, I thought about how elated I'd be by the opportunity to play at a major league stadium. So I ended up really appreciating the golf courses at the Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón.\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton Naples, Tiburón isn't just for golfers. The hotel has a small water park next to the pool area with tall, winding slides and a lazy river.\n\nI'd stayed at hotels that had water slides before, but I'd never even heard of one with a lazy river. I'm not much of a thrill seeker, so I was excited to partake in a leisurely water activity. I hopped into an inflatable tube and looked up at the palm trees swaying in the breeze as I floated around the shady loop.\n\nOn my second day in Naples, I took the shuttle to the hotel chain's other location on the beach. When I stepped inside, I was stunned by the most beautiful bar I'd ever seen in a hotel lobby.\n\nRenovated in 2023, RITZ Lobby Bar was designed to feel celebratory, according to the hotel's website. And I think they nailed it.\n\nDainty light fixtures dangled from the ceiling above, arched windows flooded the room with light, and gold accents brought the room together.\n\nAs a lover of boutique hotels and unique stays, I didn't expect to be blown away by the Ritz-Carlton. But since two locations in the same city offered completely different experiences, I'm intrigued to see what other Ritz-Carlton resorts are like.",

But a hurricane in the 1980s left the Crandon Park Zoo in shambles.\n\nEstablished in the 1940s, the Crandon Park Zoo was Miami's first zoo, according to the Miami Herald. The park closed following the natural disaster. Animals that survived the hurricane were moved to a larger area.\n\nIn 1991, the zoo ruins reopened as gardens with the goal \"not to destroy everything,\" Kevin Asher, a planner for the county, told the Miami Herald.\n\nI visited the park in October 2021 to see what remained of the abandoned zoo, and I found a natural wildlife sanctuary.\n\nAccording to Atlas Obscura, the ruins are also home to wild alligators, iguanas, and peacocks.\n\nParts of the park were paved, while other parts felt like the wild. Some of the lands were once a coconut plantation, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nI thought it looked like it could have been a unique, immersive attraction and wondered what animals may have lived there decades ago.\n\nI peered over high, chain-linked fences and spotted remnants of vandalized structures.\n\nIt appeared to once house multiple cages.\n\nI was able to see inside a few of the animals' quarters, which were now empty aside from some leaves, branches, and overgrown vines. The doors were still locked.\n\nI tried to imagine what kind of animals could live in these spaces. Based on their size, maybe monkeys, I thought.\n\nAfter my visit, the zoo celebrated its 75th anniversary of serving the community in November 2022, according to CBS Miami.",

    "description": "The sheriff claims that Rittenhouse is trying to make money off an incident in his county.",
    "fullText": "Kyle Rittenhouse returned to social media this week, and he is already drawing the ire of at least one sheriff in Florida.\n\nRittenhouse, who shot three people, killing two, during a racial injustice protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 2020, claimed self-defense and was acquitted of all charges. He remains controversial, though, and his new gig appears to be attempting to call out incidents that he believes are Second Amendment issues.\n\nThat led him to share a video on Friday standing in front of the Walton County Jail while claiming that Michael Rediker “used Florida’s ‘Stand Your Ground’ law to lawfully defend himself when his life was put in jeopardy.”\n\n“Michael did nothing wrong, and he deserves all our support,” Rittenhouse said in the video which he pinned to his X page.\n\n“We are expecting an outright not guilty under Florida’s Stand Your Ground law,” he added.\n\nWalton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson did not take kindly to Rittenhouse’s claims. He reshared the video via the Walton County Sheriff Office’s official X account, and issued a video of his own scathing response.\n\n“I don’t normally do this,” Adkinson said. “I don’t normally take the time to speak to public comments on cases, certainly not open cases. But in this particular situation, a murder that occurred yesterday in Walton County, I feel compelled to respond to what I can only call wildly irresponsible. I would say motivated by many factors, none of them in the interest of justice in which individuals, particularly Kyle Rittenhouse and his attorney, Anthony Sabatini, are attempting to frame the murder here in Walton County on Thursday of Mr. Keen as a Stand Your Ground case or wrapping it in the Constitution or that it is Second Amendment case.”\n\n“After 30-something years of doing this, I very rarely get personally offended, but I’m actually just kind of disgusted with them,” the sheriff continued. “There was a man who lost his life yesterday. A father, a husband with two small children, who was murdered, unarmed on his own property, unprovoked by an individual who drove a tractor over a half a mile onto the victim’s property. Once there, batters his wife in front of eyewitnesses. When the husband, whom there had been no confrontation with, gets out to come over and help pick his wife up off the ground the suspect shoots him in the face. He was unarmed. There was no fight between them. There was no attack, and as he is laying dying on the ground, this suspect, Michael Rediker, stood over him and made some comments for which he is going to answer to in court. At the same time, he committed aggravated assault on multiple other people because he murdered this man in front of witnesses that watched this as this man was murdered. Again, unarmed, on his own property, after his wife had been battered, and no confrontation.\n\n“Now, somehow out of that, Mr. Rittenhouse and his attorney, Anthony Sabatini, have determined that this is the great Stand Your Ground case,” Adkinson continued. “Well, I’ll tell you this. I’ll bet my badge on this. Not only is that not a stand your ground, Mr. Rediker will face either the ultimate penalty in the state of Florida or God willing the rest of his natural life in prison. Because, come Christmas morning in two weeks, there are two little boys elementary school age, two children, that are not going to have their father, and there’s a wife whose not going to have her husband all so these two idiots can get more likes on their Facebook and call it a Constitutional issue.”\n\n“I’m actually just disgusted with @rittenhouse2a and @AnthonySabatini. A man lost his life yesterday. A father. A husband. With two small children. Who was murdered, unarmed, on his own property unprovoked by an individual who drove a tractor a half a mile onto the victim’s… https://t.co/HQbexbApzO pic.twitter.com/y6t7lGMKOd\n\n— Walton County Sheriff's Office, Florida (@WCSOFL) December 13, 2025\n\n“I think both of you are jokes, and I don’t think you should make a damn cent off the suffering of someone else,” he said. “So, if you don’t like that, well you can file that under I don’t really give a damn. I know people aren’t’ going to like this, and I don’t care about that either. I’m so disgusted and sad for the Keen family and their loss and the fact that these two yo-yos are going to try to make money and news on it. And I probably shouldn’t give them this, but I think the public deserves to know this doesn’t have a damn thing to do with the Second Amendment or Stand Your Ground. So, I hope that many of you will reach out and tell these two jack-wagons what you think about what they are doing to this family suffering.\n\n“Don’t let them make on penny off a like.”\n\nWMBB reported that Rediker, 44, was arrested on Thursday and charged with one count of open murder, battery, and three counts of aggravated battery.\n\nRittenhouse made headlines this week when he returned to social media after leaving in June and sharing some big news.\n\n“I’m back on social media, I’m back in the fight, and I’m here to stay,” he wrote on X alongside a pair of photos of himself with a girl.\n\nHe then explained what that was all about.\n\n“For a quick update, 6 months ago I made the best decision of my life and married my best friend,” he wrote. “(Bella Rittenhouse), I couldn’t be happier. I love you beautiful.”\n\nShe replied back, “I love you!”\n\nOne of his followers replied, “Couldn’t be happier for you Kyle. To have your entire world upended and fight through it. Dude, that’s awesome.”\n\n“I’m still being sued for $20 million,” Rittenhouse replied. “But thankfully the Lord provides.”\n\nRittenhouse made several more posts during the day, including one where he said that the assassination of Charlie Kirk convinced him he “couldn’t sit on the sidelines anymore.”\n\n“So I’m back,” he wrote. “Not quietly. Not halfway. I’m coming back in a big way.”",

Raines also sports a 13-0 record headed into the contest.\n\nNorthwestern will be seeking its eight state championship in football while Raines is in the hunt for its fourth football state championship trophy.\n\nGame time is set for 7:30 p.m. EST local.\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:No. 22 Northwestern [Miami, FL] Bulls vs. Raines [Jacksonville, FL] Vikings\n\nThis Raines defense! I've been talking about them all night here, and they get an interception with a big return when Northwestern goes for it on fourth down. After trailing by nine, the Vikings are, amazingly, in business.\n\nWith 7:12 to play, Raines finally has some points from the offense, tacking on a field goal. It's important. It gets this back to a one-score game, and a touchdown and PAT could possibly win it.\n\nThis was never going to be easy for Raines, and it just got a lot harder as the Vikings' defense finally gives up its first touchdown. Northwestern back firmly in control in a two-score game now.\n\nWell, Raines has finally scored against Northwestern, but it's the only 7 points they have in seven quarters against this Northwestern team the past two years. But, the difference this year is their defense is keeping this thing close. And that defense might have to go and win this thing for them.\n\nNorthwestern shakes off the interception and drives down into position for another field goal. But these are still small victories for the Vikings. They're giving their offense every opportunity to go win this game.\n\nWell, the defense for Raines has been keeping them in this game, and now they've given the Vikings the lead on a long interception return. This is a crazy swing, and in seven quarters of play against Northwestern, this is the first points Raines has managed. But this is no anomaly; this is the Viking's 12th defensive touchdown this year.\n\nNorthwestern adds another field goal, but Raines' defense is playing tough tonight. They're giving the offense a chance if it can ever get on track.\n\nAnd the third quarter is just getting under way!\n\nThis is looking a lot better than last year, but one important number is the same so far – that goose egg on the Vikings' side of the scoreboard. They lost last year's game 41-0, and through two quarters tonight, the offense still hasn't cracked the code against this stout Bulls' defense.\n\nRaines was finally driving deep in Northwestern's territory, helped along by a pass interference penalty. But then they throw an interception near the 5 yard line with 39 seconds to play in the first half.\n\nKhavon Gipson with a clutch interception for Northwestern. Raines was driving. pic.twitter.com/WKTZkhHnnN\n\n— Adam Lichtenstein (@ABLichtenstein) December 13, 2025\n\nNorthwestern was about to score when the running back took a hard lick near the goal line. The ball rolled into the end zone where Raines recovered to take over. The Vikings' defense is bending but not breaking. But they need some help from the offense late in the second quarter.\n\nRaines was pinned deep in its own territory after the turnover on downs. They were forced to punt from their end zone, but Northwestern mishandles the punt, and Raines pounces on it. Northwestern would have had great field position around the Vikings' 30, but instead, the Vikings keep their drive alive.\n\nNorthwestern takes their second drive inside the Raines' 5. On fourth and goal, they go for the first down, but the Vikings' defense forces the turnover on downs!\n\nNorthwestern puts together a solid drive, but Raines' defense stands tall in the shadow of their own end zone to force a field goal.\n\nField goal! @mnw_fb scores first.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMIAMI, Florida, Dec. 12 — The West Boca Raton [Boca Raton, FL] Bulls will take on the West Broward [Pembroke Pines, FL] Bobcats Friday afternoon at Florida International University's Pitbull Stadium for Florida's FHSAA Class 6A state championship.\n\nBoth teams enter the game with 12-2 records, and the Bulls will be defending their 2024 Class 6A title that came via a 26-7 win over the Osceola [Kissimmee, FL] Kowboys a year ago. The two appearances in the title game are the only times that West Boca Raton has advanced to the final in school history.\n\nBut West Broward's appearance will mark its debut in Florida's championship finals history. The Bobcats were 9-4 a year ago, losing in the regional finals in a 51-21 rout at the hands of the Southridge [Miami, FL] Spartans. They avenged that loss two weeks ago in a 30-27 win over the Spartans, and then cleared the final hurdle last week in a 24-17 win over the Buchholz [Gainesville, FL] Bobcats.\n\nGame time is set for 12:30 p.m. EST local\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:West Boca Raton [Boca Raton, FL] Bulls vs. West Broward [Pembroke Pines, FL] Bobcats\n\nWell, this game got away from West Broward pretty quick in the second quarter. West Boca adds a field goal just before the half, and the Bobcats have a lot of work to do just to get back into this thing.\n\nWell, after a long stretch with no scoring, West Boca is finding its groove on both sides of the ball. This time, the Bulls force a fumble, and Tray Mitchell goes 60 yards on the scoop and score. Suddenly, West Broward finds itself in a two-touchdown hole, and that's big against a team like West Boca.\n\nJavian Mallory goes the distance from 50 yards to put the favored Bulls out front on the scoreboard.\n\nIt feels like these two Florida heavyweights are still feeling each other out, exploring ways to gain the early momentum. It's a fast-moving game with few stoppages due in part to the lack of scoring, of course.\n\nIt's been a fast-moving first quarter with no offensive fireworks, yet. They're in a timeout with less than a minute to play in the opening quarter in a game that is still scoreless.\n\nFlorida's FHSAA Class 6A title game is under way in Miami, Florida! It looks like a good day for football in South Florida.\n\nStart time: 12:30 p.m. EST local\n\nThe game between West Boca Raton and West Broward is being played at Florida International University's Pitbull Stadium.\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:West Boca Raton [Boca Raton, FL] Bulls vs. West Broward [Pembroke Pines, FL] Bobcats\n\nMORE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFF HEADLINES\n\nFlorida 2025 playoff brackets (7A/6A/5A/4A)\n\nGeorgia 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)\n\nLouisiana 2025 playoff brackets (Division I/II)\n\nTexas 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)",

    "fullText": "DENVER — It’s been a recurring theme throughout Nathan MacKinnon’s brilliant career — and on Thursday night, he made history again.\n\nWith his 25th goal of the season, MacKinnon passed Joe Sakic to become the all-time leading goal scorer in Colorado Avalanche history, helping propel the Avs to a dominant 6–1 win over the reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers. MacKinnon finished the night with a goal and an assist.\n\nBrock Nelson, Gavin Brindley, and Sam Malinski each contributed a goal and an assist for Colorado, while Artturi Lehkonen and Gabe Landeskog also found the back of the net. Josh Manson added two assists, and Mackenzie Blackwood turned aside 22 shots.\n\nNATHAN MACKINNON SNIPE THROUGH TRAFFIC #GoAvsGo pic.twitter.com/ZEp5b0Vu9m\n\n— PrimeMakar8 (@retro_colorado) December 12, 2025\n\nNoah Gregor and Mackie Samoskevich scored for Florida. Daniil Tarasov had a difficult night in goal, surrendering six goals on 42 shots — including three in a lopsided second period.\n\nMalinski opened the scoring just 1:14 into the game, taking a pass from Necas in the right circle and snapping a wrister that slipped off Tarasov’s glove and in.\n\nThrough six minutes, Colorado held a 7–1 advantage in shots. Florida capitalized on its second shot of the night when Gregor broke into the zone off a feed from Seth Jones, accelerated down the left wing, and beat his former San Jose Sharks teammate Blackwood short side. Devon Toews and Samuel Girard were a step late closing in, and the game was tied.\n\nCarter Verhaeghe went to the box for slashing Parker Kelly into the boards, but the Avalanche failed to convert on the power play.\n\nParker Kelly gets slashed and crashes into the boards.\n\nCarter Verhaeghe will go to the box.

It was a smart penalty to take, and the Avs killed it off to the delight of the crowd.\n\nNelson restored the lead with 1:30 left in the period, cleaning up a rebound from a Cale Makar shot that bounced off Tarasov. It was Nelson’s twelfth of the season and gave Colorado a 2–1 advantage.\n\nAt 5:06 of the middle frame, Brindley scored in his return from a 10-game absence due to a lower-body injury. Brent Burns released the initial shot, and Brindley buried the rebound to make it 3–1.\n\nGAVIN BRINDLEY!!!!!!!! \n\n3-1 AVS!!!#goavsgo #avs @TheHockeyNews\n\n— Ryan O'Hara (@OHaraSports) December 12, 2025\n\nNot long after, MacKinnon collected a pass from Girard and snapped his twenty-fifth goal of the year over Tarasov’s glove, extending the lead.\n\nLehkonen made it 5–1 on a breakaway, finishing five-hole after being sprung by Toews and Brindley.\n\nLehkonen nearly scored again with 4:41 left when he one-timed a feed from MacKinnon, but Tarasov smothered it in the chest. Lehkonen stared up at the rafters in disbelief.\n\nColorado earned another power play after Niko Mikkola was called for holding, though the Avs could not cash in. The officials missed a clear tripping call on Nelson when Verhaeghe took his legs out in the dying seconds of the man advantage.\n\nFlorida was soon back in the box anyway, as Samoskevich tripped Brindley. Necas appeared to score on the ensuing power play, but the goal was overturned for offside. Colorado carried a four-goal lead into the intermission with fifty-two seconds remaining on the man advantage.\n\nVerhaeghe had a goal wiped out nearly five minutes into the period after officials ruled he deliberately kicked the puck in. The review was brief and the call stood.\n\nLandeskog made it 6–1 at 6:18, jamming in a loose puck after Josh Manson’s shot was redirected by Necas and bounced off Tarasov’s pad. Landeskog jumped on the rebound at the back door and finished the play.\n\nREBOUND SCORE!!!\n\nIt's GABE LANDESKOG\n\n6-1 Colorado#goavsgo #avs @thehockeynews\n\n— Ryan O'Hara (@OHaraSports) December 12, 2025\n\nSamoskevich scored with just under seven minutes remaining in regulation on a beautiful sequence set up by crisp passes from A.J. Greer and Evan Rodrigues, cutting the deficit to 6–2.\n\nJoel Kiviranta suffered an upper-body injury and will be evaluated, though Coach Jared Bednar told reporters after the game that it’s “nothing too serious.”\n\nA.J. Greer also left late for the Panthers after suffering an injury and was taken to the medical tent. No further updates were provided.\n\nGavin Brindley, Nathan MacKinnon, and Brock Nelson were named the three stars of the game.\n\nThe NHL-leading Colorado Avalanche (22-2-7) square off against the Nashville Predators (15-13-2) on Saturday at Ball Arena.

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Catch by catch, Kyle Pitts Sr. put the mistake-prone Atlanta Falcons on his back and carried them to a thrilling comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThursday night got even better for the fifth-year pro when the former University of Florida star learned his 11-reception, 166-yard, three-touchdown performance that keyed a 29-28 win was the most productive game by an NFL tight end in nearly three decades.\n\nThe previous tight end to finish with at least 10 catches, 150 yards receiving and three TDs in a game was Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in 1996.\n\nThe 25-year-old Pitts noted he wasn't even born yet back then.\n\n“Man, I love the state of Florida,” the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Pitts said as he stepped up to the podium in the visiting interview room at Raymond James Stadium.\n\n“It means a lot,” he added about the mention of Sharpe. “It's a great person to be (compared to).”\n\nKurt Cousins targeted Pitts a team-high 12 times, leaning heavily on the young tight end with leading receiver Drake London out with a knee injury. Pitts scored on receptions of 8, 17 and 7 yards, the latter trimming what had once been a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 28-26 with 3:34 remaining.\n\nHis last catch, on third-and-28 from the Atlanta 29, was for 14 yards. Cousins threw 21 yards to David Sills V on fourth-and-14 to set up Zane Gonzalez's 43-yard game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n“It was the plan, you know, all along. Kyle is our guy,” second-year Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. “You're down a couple of your guys like Drake, some of those guys, and Kyle has really filled in that role and become the lead dog guy. He has done an awesome job.”\n\nThe Falcons (5-9) are eliminated from playoff contention, but they relished the opportunity to play spoiler against the division-rival Bucs (7-7), who are trying to win the NFC South for the fifth straight season.\n\n“It's amazing. I mean, we've been having our ups and downs through the year,” Pitts said. “Obviously, it's not fun being eliminated early, but we're resilient. ... It was just pretty fun to get that win.”\n\nThe Falcons overcame a team-record 19 penalties for 125 yards. They also withstood a wide-open Sills dropping what would have been a go-ahead TD catch in the third quarter, as well as Bijan Robinson's third-quarter fumble that led to the touchdown that put Tampa Bay up by two scores early in the fourth.\n\n“It's a steppingstone to where we want to go,” Morris said. “We talked about this, building blocks for what we've got to do. What we're talking about is next year. ... Only thing we can do right now is finish.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

The redux was a lot closer as the Raiders were only able to muster up three DiSalvatore field goals in the first half.\n\nA reason Lakeland was able to remain in the contest was the play of quarterback Keelin Hendrix, who was making plays with his arm and legs all throughout the evening. Hendrix finished the night totaling 226 all-purpose yards.\n\nThe mtachup the last two seasons between the two perennial powers hasn’t been all too close, with St. Thomas Aquinas edging Lakeland by a combined 63-0 score.\n\nFor Florida high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "description": "The recent A Safehouse in the Hills update for GTA Online may contain clues about Grand Theft Auto VI, or at least that's what the franchise's passionate fanbase is theorizing based on some recent discoveries.\nAfter the big new update went live on December 10, people dug into the game's code in search of anything that might provide clues about GTA 6, and people think they found some. A line of text that was discovered references a voice line for the character Jimmy, the son of main character Michael, that says he is \"moving out of state.\" Another line, from his mother Amanda, says, \"Our son is finally moving away from home.\" People are taking this to suggest that Jimmy may have moved to Leonida, the stand-in for GTA 6's setting of Florida, but that's just conjecture for now.",

    "fullText": "STARKE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of stabbing a woman to death during a home invasion robbery more than 30 years ago is scheduled to be executed Tuesday evening in Florida.\n\nMark Allen Geralds, 58, is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke. Geralds was convicted of murder, armed robbery, burglary and stealing a car and was sentenced to death in 1990. The Florida Supreme Court later vacated the sentence but affirmed the conviction, and Geralds was resentenced to death in 1992.\n\nIt would be Florida's 18th death sentence carried out in 2025, further extending the state record for total executions in a single year.\n\nAccording to court records, Tressa Pettibone’s 8-year-old son found his mother beaten and stabbed to death on the kitchen floor of their Panama City home in February 1989. Geralds was a carpenter who had previously done remodeling work at the home.\n\nGeralds ran into Pettibone and her children at a shopping mall about a week before the killing, and Pettibone mentioned that her husband was away on business. Geralds later approached Pettibone's son at the video arcade and asked when the boy's father would return and what time he and his sister left for and returned from school each day, according to court records.\n\nInvestigators found that Geralds pawned jewelry with traces of Pettibone’s blood on it, and plastic ties used to bind Pettibone matched ties found in Geralds’ car.\n\nAfter a death warrant was signed last month and his execution date set, Geralds told a judge he did not wish to pursue any further appeals. The judge signed off on that decision.\n\nA total of 44 men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and a handful of executions are scheduled for the rest of the year.\n\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, the highest previous annual total of Florida executions was eight in 2014. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year. Another execution is planned for next week in the state under death warrants signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nFrank Athen Walls, 58, is scheduled for Florida’s 19th execution this year on Dec. 18. He was convicted of fatally shooting a man and woman during a home invasion robbery and later confessing to three other killings.\n\nFlorida's lethal injections are carried out with a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",

Only employees nominated by their superiors for “exemplary service” were awarded the $10,000 bonus.\n\nThe TSA employs over 50,000 transportation security officers out of its approximate 65,000 total employees.\n\nThe DHS did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
