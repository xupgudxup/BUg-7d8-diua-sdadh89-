    "fullText": "DENVER — It’s been a recurring theme throughout Nathan MacKinnon’s brilliant career — and on Thursday night, he made history again.\n\nWith his 25th goal of the season, MacKinnon passed Joe Sakic to become the all-time leading goal scorer in Colorado Avalanche history, helping propel the Avs to a dominant 6–1 win over the reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers. MacKinnon finished the night with a goal and an assist.\n\nBrock Nelson, Gavin Brindley, and Sam Malinski each contributed a goal and an assist for Colorado, while Artturi Lehkonen and Gabe Landeskog also found the back of the net. Josh Manson added two assists, and Mackenzie Blackwood turned aside 22 shots.\n\nNATHAN MACKINNON SNIPE THROUGH TRAFFIC #GoAvsGo pic.twitter.com/ZEp5b0Vu9m\n\n— PrimeMakar8 (@retro_colorado) December 12, 2025\n\nNoah Gregor and Mackie Samoskevich scored for Florida. Daniil Tarasov had a difficult night in goal, surrendering six goals on 42 shots — including three in a lopsided second period.\n\nMalinski opened the scoring just 1:14 into the game, taking a pass from Necas in the right circle and snapping a wrister that slipped off Tarasov’s glove and in.\n\nThrough six minutes, Colorado held a 7–1 advantage in shots. Florida capitalized on its second shot of the night when Gregor broke into the zone off a feed from Seth Jones, accelerated down the left wing, and beat his former San Jose Sharks teammate Blackwood short side. Devon Toews and Samuel Girard were a step late closing in, and the game was tied.\n\nCarter Verhaeghe went to the box for slashing Parker Kelly into the boards, but the Avalanche failed to convert on the power play.\n\nParker Kelly gets slashed and crashes into the boards.\n\nCarter Verhaeghe will go to the box. Avs on the power play. #goavsgo #avs @TheHockeyNews\n\n— Ryan O'Hara (@OHaraSports) December 12, 2025\n\nColorado found itself shorthanded with 6:41 left after Manson hooked Eetu Luostarinen, who was staring at an open net off a rebound. It was a smart penalty to take, and the Avs killed it off to the delight of the crowd.\n\nNelson restored the lead with 1:30 left in the period, cleaning up a rebound from a Cale Makar shot that bounced off Tarasov. It was Nelson’s twelfth of the season and gave Colorado a 2–1 advantage.\n\nAt 5:06 of the middle frame, Brindley scored in his return from a 10-game absence due to a lower-body injury. Brent Burns released the initial shot, and Brindley buried the rebound to make it 3–1.\n\nGAVIN BRINDLEY!!!!!!!! \n\n3-1 AVS!!!#goavsgo #avs @TheHockeyNews\n\n— Ryan O'Hara (@OHaraSports) December 12, 2025\n\nNot long after, MacKinnon collected a pass from Girard and snapped his twenty-fifth goal of the year over Tarasov’s glove, extending the lead.\n\nLehkonen made it 5–1 on a breakaway, finishing five-hole after being sprung by Toews and Brindley.\n\nLehkonen nearly scored again with 4:41 left when he one-timed a feed from MacKinnon, but Tarasov smothered it in the chest. Lehkonen stared up at the rafters in disbelief.\n\nColorado earned another power play after Niko Mikkola was called for holding, though the Avs could not cash in. The officials missed a clear tripping call on Nelson when Verhaeghe took his legs out in the dying seconds of the man advantage.\n\nFlorida was soon back in the box anyway, as Samoskevich tripped Brindley. Necas appeared to score on the ensuing power play, but the goal was overturned for offside. Colorado carried a four-goal lead into the intermission with fifty-two seconds remaining on the man advantage.\n\nVerhaeghe had a goal wiped out nearly five minutes into the period after officials ruled he deliberately kicked the puck in. The review was brief and the call stood.\n\nLandeskog made it 6–1 at 6:18, jamming in a loose puck after Josh Manson’s shot was redirected by Necas and bounced off Tarasov’s pad. Landeskog jumped on the rebound at the back door and finished the play.\n\nREBOUND SCORE!!!\n\nIt's GABE LANDESKOG\n\n6-1 Colorado#goavsgo #avs @thehockeynews\n\n— Ryan O'Hara (@OHaraSports) December 12, 2025\n\nSamoskevich scored with just under seven minutes remaining in regulation on a beautiful sequence set up by crisp passes from A.J. Greer and Evan Rodrigues, cutting the deficit to 6–2.\n\nJoel Kiviranta suffered an upper-body injury and will be evaluated, though Coach Jared Bednar told reporters after the game that it’s “nothing too serious.”\n\nA.J. Greer also left late for the Panthers after suffering an injury and was taken to the medical tent. No further updates were provided.\n\nGavin Brindley, Nathan MacKinnon, and Brock Nelson were named the three stars of the game.\n\nThe NHL-leading Colorado Avalanche (22-2-7) square off against the Nashville Predators (15-13-2) on Saturday at Ball Arena.

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Catch by catch, Kyle Pitts Sr. put the mistake-prone Atlanta Falcons on his back and carried them to a thrilling comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThursday night got even better for the fifth-year pro when the former University of Florida star learned his 11-reception, 166-yard, three-touchdown performance that keyed a 29-28 win was the most productive game by an NFL tight end in nearly three decades.\n\nThe previous tight end to finish with at least 10 catches, 150 yards receiving and three TDs in a game was Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in 1996.\n\nThe 25-year-old Pitts noted he wasn't even born yet back then.\n\n“Man, I love the state of Florida,” the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Pitts said as he stepped up to the podium in the visiting interview room at Raymond James Stadium.\n\n“It means a lot,” he added about the mention of Sharpe. “It's a great person to be (compared to).”\n\nKurt Cousins targeted Pitts a team-high 12 times, leaning heavily on the young tight end with leading receiver Drake London out with a knee injury. Pitts scored on receptions of 8, 17 and 7 yards, the latter trimming what had once been a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 28-26 with 3:34 remaining.\n\nHis last catch, on third-and-28 from the Atlanta 29, was for 14 yards. Cousins threw 21 yards to David Sills V on fourth-and-14 to set up Zane Gonzalez's 43-yard game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n“It was the plan, you know, all along. Kyle is our guy,” second-year Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. “You're down a couple of your guys like Drake, some of those guys, and Kyle has really filled in that role and become the lead dog guy. He has done an awesome job.”\n\nThe Falcons (5-9) are eliminated from playoff contention, but they relished the opportunity to play spoiler against the division-rival Bucs (7-7), who are trying to win the NFC South for the fifth straight season.\n\n“It's amazing. I mean, we've been having our ups and downs through the year,” Pitts said. “Obviously, it's not fun being eliminated early, but we're resilient. ... It was just pretty fun to get that win.”\n\nThe Falcons overcame a team-record 19 penalties for 125 yards. They also withstood a wide-open Sills dropping what would have been a go-ahead TD catch in the third quarter, as well as Bijan Robinson's third-quarter fumble that led to the touchdown that put Tampa Bay up by two scores early in the fourth.\n\n“It's a steppingstone to where we want to go,” Morris said. “We talked about this, building blocks for what we've got to do. What we're talking about is next year. ... Only thing we can do right now is finish.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

The redux was a lot closer as the Raiders were only able to muster up three DiSalvatore field goals in the first half.\n\nA reason Lakeland was able to remain in the contest was the play of quarterback Keelin Hendrix, who was making plays with his arm and legs all throughout the evening. Hendrix finished the night totaling 226 all-purpose yards.\n\nThe mtachup the last two seasons between the two perennial powers hasn’t been all too close, with St. Thomas Aquinas edging Lakeland by a combined 63-0 score.\n\nFor Florida high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

A line of text that was discovered references a voice line for the character Jimmy, the son of main character Michael, that says he is \"moving out of state.\" Another line, from his mother Amanda, says, \"Our son is finally moving away from home.\" People are taking this to suggest that Jimmy may have moved to Leonida, the stand-in for GTA 6's setting of Florida, but that's just conjecture for now.",

    "fullText": "STARKE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of stabbing a woman to death during a home invasion robbery more than 30 years ago is scheduled to be executed Tuesday evening in Florida.\n\nMark Allen Geralds, 58, is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke. Geralds was convicted of murder, armed robbery, burglary and stealing a car and was sentenced to death in 1990. The Florida Supreme Court later vacated the sentence but affirmed the conviction, and Geralds was resentenced to death in 1992.\n\nIt would be Florida's 18th death sentence carried out in 2025, further extending the state record for total executions in a single year.\n\nAccording to court records, Tressa Pettibone’s 8-year-old son found his mother beaten and stabbed to death on the kitchen floor of their Panama City home in February 1989. Geralds was a carpenter who had previously done remodeling work at the home.\n\nGeralds ran into Pettibone and her children at a shopping mall about a week before the killing, and Pettibone mentioned that her husband was away on business. Geralds later approached Pettibone's son at the video arcade and asked when the boy's father would return and what time he and his sister left for and returned from school each day, according to court records.\n\nInvestigators found that Geralds pawned jewelry with traces of Pettibone’s blood on it, and plastic ties used to bind Pettibone matched ties found in Geralds’ car.\n\nAfter a death warrant was signed last month and his execution date set, Geralds told a judge he did not wish to pursue any further appeals. The judge signed off on that decision.\n\nA total of 44 men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and a handful of executions are scheduled for the rest of the year.\n\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, the highest previous annual total of Florida executions was eight in 2014. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year. Another execution is planned for next week in the state under death warrants signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nFrank Athen Walls, 58, is scheduled for Florida’s 19th execution this year on Dec. 18. He was convicted of fatally shooting a man and woman during a home invasion robbery and later confessing to three other killings.\n\nFlorida's lethal injections are carried out with a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",

Only employees nominated by their superiors for “exemplary service” were awarded the $10,000 bonus.\n\nThe TSA employs over 50,000 transportation security officers out of its approximate 65,000 total employees.\n\nThe DHS did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
