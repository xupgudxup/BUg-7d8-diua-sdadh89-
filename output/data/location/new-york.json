Posted on November 21, the three engaged in a wide-ranging conversation that started with the face-scanning feature, moved to misnomers about data, and peaked at disgreements regarding the use of AI for moderation. Newtown opened with an inquiry about the problem with predators on Roblox, which Baszucki said is a good and bad dilemma.",

Sassoon, who graduated from Harvard College in 2008 and from Yale Law School in 2011, was adamant that she never suggested such a deal and had gone to great lengths to insist to the woman’s lawyers that no deal like that was possible.",
