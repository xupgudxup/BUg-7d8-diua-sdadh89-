    "fullText": "The New York Giants and John Harbaugh are nearing a deal to make Harbaugh the Giants’ next coach.\n\nThe report, per Adam Schefter of ESPN, came late Wednesday following a long meeting between the two parties during the day.\n\nJohn Harbaugh and the Giants are working to finalize an agreement to make him New York’s next head coach and, barring a setback, a deal is expected, multiple sources tell ESPN.\n\nThe deal is not final and contract numbers still are being negotiated. “There still is a lot to work… pic.twitter.com/CQmSljImf9\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 15, 2026\n\nSchefter posted a few more times on the topic, expressing the Giants’ aggressive pursuit of the veteran coach. An agreement is expected barring a setback.\n\nA look at the Giants’ future: pic.twitter.com/xv2GDlZAoN\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 15, 2026\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens turned the 2026 coaching cycle on its head when they made the decision to fire Harbaugh after 18 years. Harbaugh immediately became the most sought after coach on the market and the Giants’ top target. The team wasted no time in establishing contact with Harbaugh’s camp, and Chris Mara even visited the Super Bowl winning coach at his Baltimore home.\n\nGeneral manager Joe Schoen led a speedy and efficient coaching search that positioned them to be the first team able to hire a coach.\n\nIt had previously been reported that Harbaugh left East Rutherford without a deal, and would take a meeting with the Tennessee Titans at home on Baltimore.\n\nInstead, it seems as though Harbaugh will eventually be announced as the Giants head coach in 2026. This is clearly welcome news to any fan who feared the team fumbled the opportunity to get the most experienced coach in a chaotic market.\n\nGiants have been starved for victories (literal and figurative) for far too long. John Harbaugh was the consensus No. 1 coaching domino, and—barring a setback—he will coach the Giants in 2026. That represents a much-needed victory for a franchise desperately seeking leadership to guide its young nucleus of talent.\n\nThe concentration now shifts to the two sides hammering out the details of an agreement, and then filling out the coaching staff to maximize the Giants’ defensive play as well as Jaxson Dart’s development.\n\nWe’ll bring you more news and updates as we get them.",

    "title": "NY Giants’ edge room was a bright spot in disappointing 2025 season",
    "description": "The New York Giants EDGE room is talented, but how do they look moving into 2026?",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants had little to cheer about throughout 2025, but the edge positiohn provided a spark to the dank swamp that was the Giants’ season. Veteran pass rusher Brian Burns finished second in the NFL with 16.5 sacks, only behind the Browns’ Myles Garrett, who broke Michael Strahan’s single-season sack record with 23. Rookie, third-overall-pick, Abdul Carter finished the season strong, after showing resiliency and overcoming his own immaturity issues.\n\nNew York finished with 39 sacks in 2025, which ranked 17th in the NFL. They had 45 in 2024 (9th in NFL) and 34 in 2023 (29th in NFL). Overall, the edge room was the Giants’ strength, but they were not perfect either. Let’s review the 2025 season.\n\nBrian Burns, Abdul Carter, Kayvon Thibodeaux, Chauncey Golston, Tomon Fox, Victor Dimukeje\n\nThe Giants had three quality edge defenders in 2025: Brian Burns, Abdul Carter, and Kayvon Thibodeaux; those three accounted for 2,201 of the total 2,465 defensive snaps. Burns led the team with 863 snaps, and Carter had 844. Kayvon Thibodeaux sustained a shoulder injury in Week 10 against the Chicago Bears and eventually landed on the Injured Reserve; he played 494 snaps and finished with 32 pressures.\n\nThibodeaux’s presence and development were felt early in the season. He only had 2.5 sacks, but had a tackle for a loss in five of his first six games. Thibodeaux added 19 STOPs at the line of scrimmage, and he was robbed of a strip of Jalen Hurts on the infamous Tush Push play. His improvement as an overall football player was evident throughout the season, but it wasn’t consistent.\n\nFinishing plays was still an issue for Thibodeaux, as he missed nine tackles in 2025 (29%). Now, to be fair, some of these missed tackles are high-effort plays from the backside that alter the running back’s path, but the point remains — need more well-rounded consistency from the 25-year-old EDGE rusher.\n\nThibodeaux missed time in 2024 as well. He finished with 324 pass-rushing snaps in 2025 and just 358 in 2024, finishing with 32 and 38 pressures, respectively. Thibodeaux has improved as a player, and he’s a good football player, but he hasn’t displayed the top-five pedigree that many Giants’ fans thought they were receiving when Joe Schoen selected him as such in 2022. Still, he’s an asset and one the Giants must make a decision about now that he enters next season on his fifth-year option.\n\nBrian Burns is the heart and soul of the Giants’ roster. No player sets an example for others to emulate like Burns. He is a constant hustler who plays through nagging injuries, while being a necessary vocal leader that this defense desperately needs.\n\nBurns had a career year with 16.5 sacks to go along with his 53 pressures; he now has 114 pressures in two seasons with the Giants. Burns was also an asset as a run defender, accounting for 42 STOPs, which is tied for a career high for Burns (2024). Burns is everything a coach would want in a leader on the football team, and he sets an excellent example for Abdul Carter.\n\nAbdul Carter has recorded 66 pressures, the 8th-most in the NFL (most among rookies this season).\n\nA league-high 44 quick pressures (under 2.5 seconds time to pressure) and averaging a 2.41-second time to pressure, the quickest in the NFL among defenders with at least 200 pass…\n\n— Nick Falato (@nickfalato) January 5, 2026\n\nFew players in the NFL were as successful as ACarter at winning in a phone booth. Carter’s quickness and fluidity are rare even at the NFL level, which is why he led the league with 44 quick pressures. Offensive linemen who failed to time their punch or failed to make clean contact on Carter struggled to account for his speed and elusiveness as a pass-rusher.\n\nDoubts surrounding Carter grew louder when Mike Kafka held him accountable TWICE for missing team meetings. It seemed apparent that Brian Daboll was soft with Carter, and Kafka made an example of him against Green Bay by benching him for a series. Two weeks later, Kafka benched Carter for the entire quarter of a prime-time game against New England.\n\nTo Carter’s credit, he took the message to heart and finished the season strong, recording 22 pressures over the final four games, with interim defensive coordinator Charlie Bullen praising his approach to practice. Carter appeared to need a kick in the rear — a reality check — to push him toward his potential. The hope now is that the lesson sparked lasting maturity and sustained motivation, rather than a brief moment of realization, spawned by internet trolling and the overall embarrassment of being held accountable.\n\nEven with Carter’s issues, he still showed enough for me to be excited about his development. He must get better against the run. The strength is necessary for him to unlock a well-rounded approach to the game. He was also frequently out of position early in the season, but that seemed to be rectified down the stretch of the year. It was not a perfect rookie season, but his talents are undeniable — let’s see how he approaches the off-season.\n\nGolston only played 173 snaps due to foot and neck injuries that he dealt with at different parts of the season. The high point of Golston’s season was against Minnesota, where he had five STOPs at the line of scrimmage and was an asset against the run. We have not seen the best of Golston; he finished with five pressures and a sack. Dimukeje and Fox hardly saw the field; the former had one pressure and the latter two.\n\nThe Giants remain strong at EDGE going into next season, although questions about Kayvon Thibodeaux’s future with the team will likely be entertained throughout the off-season. Thibodeaux is entering his fifth-year option season and is a possible trade or extension candidate. Trading Thibodeaux would free up $14.8 million on the cap with no dead cap incurred.\n\nPersonally, I would love to extend Thibodeaux, and the Giants may get him at a slight discount, since he’s finished the last two seasons on the I.R. However, Thibodeaux may want to wait and see his options after next season, which puts the Giants in a position to explore the market, depending on their long-term interest in the 25-year-old.\n\nWith no off-season trades, a trio of Burns, Carter, and Thibodeaux is a lethal edge room for any defensive coordinator. Bullen was able to generate success and deceptive looks from the front with Burns and Carter at the end of the season, and Shane Bowen even helped Burns achieve a career-type of year. The defensive structure will be important, but the ingredients (the personnel) are an excellent baseline — let’s hope they find someone who can cook.\n\nI will say, though, the Giants could still use another edge defender, whether it’s a veteran signing or a day three pick. More depth at the position now that Dimukeje — who missed most of the season with injuries — and Fox are not under contract. Like many positions on the roster, the depth could be replenished, but the top-end of the edge room remains the most impressive on the roster.",

They'll deal with the fallout if there is any with the rest of their candidate list if he says no.\n\nThe Giants are clearly executing a multifaceted plan to convince Harbaugh to be the next NYG coach. There was a promise of more interactions to come, and the biggest is taking place Wednesday.\n\nNow the question is whether the Giants sell Harbaugh enough to close the deal before he leaves, potentially for a reported two more in-person visits he is expected to take with the Tennessee Titans and the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nRumors are swirling on social media regarding John Harbaugh's schedule. Here's what we know: the expectation is that the 63-year-old free agent coach will meet with the Giants and other potential suitors - reportedly the Falcons and the Titans - by the end of the week.\n\nDoes that mean Friday? Does that mean Sunday? It's not exactly clear.\n\nAnd while the anticipation is that Harbaugh would travel to those cities, it's still yet to be confirmed that he will be boots-on-the-ground inside 1925 Giants Drive - or anywhere else - on this interview circuit. The contingents could still travel and meet with the former Ravens coach.\n\nWe'll stay on top of all the news and nuggets throughout the day, so stick around.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: NY Giants coaching search tracker with news and candidate updates",

    "description": "I graduated from college and moved to New York City to apply for full-time jobs. I haven't found one yet, but I've learned to prioritize my hobbies.",
    "fullText": "Before graduating from Syracuse University last spring with a degree in journalism, it seemed like everyone (including me) was scrambling to make plans, get jobs, and figure out where to move.\n\nI always expected life after college would fall seamlessly into place, that all of my involvement in campus media, internships, and good grades would pay off immediately.\n\nSo, when I learned that my childhood friend was planning to move to New York City, it was the perfect opportunity to take the leap together. I'd always dreamed of moving there, and as the home of many big-name publications, it seemed like the right city to be in to kick-start my career.\n\nCome June, I'd moved, gotten a job at a coffee shop, and continued applying to every dream job under the sun (just like the hundreds of other LinkedIn applicants).\n\nLittle did I know, the barista position I'd only planned to have for a month or two would still be my lifeline seven months later.\n\nAt the beginning of my job search, I was incredibly motivated, but slowly, the rejections began to roll in.\n\nI started feeling like maybe I was the problem, that my experiences and skills weren't good enough. How was I supposed to gain more experience if no one would hire me?\n\nImposter syndrome hit me hard, especially since it seemed like the first question anyone wanted to ask me was, \"What do you do?\"\n\nAt first, I'd provide a whole spiel: I just graduated and am working as a barista while I look for a job in journalism, and interviews are going well. I always felt the need to make it appear as though I was on the brink of getting \"the job.\"\n\nThe catalyst for shifting my mindset came later, over dinner with a friend at our favorite Indian restaurant. We talked about life, relationships, New York work culture, and overall, what it means to unplug from the outside world for a second.\n\nMy friend shared his thoughts on being part of corporate America and said he doesn't base his worth on the job he has or his level of success. His words made me think about my own self-worth and why I'd been placing it all on my career and how qualified I am compared to others.\n\nNow, when I'm faced with the \"what do you do\" question, I say I'm a barista and freelancer looking for full-time work in journalism.\n\nI'm less concerned with explaining why I'm not working in corporate yet and more concerned with maintaining my peace and joy, as well as exploring my other interests.\n\nAlthough people's responses to my answers haven't changed much, my confidence in where I'm at and where I'm going has.\n\nAlthough this isn't the life I envisioned having after graduation, I'm grateful for the time I've had to explore my hobbies and be an active member of my community.\n\nAs an avid yogi and certified yoga teacher, I've enjoyed taking free yoga classes in Bryant Park. It's been a great way to get moving, plus it's given me a reason to stop with the endless job applications and catch up with some friends.\n\nIn my free time after barista shifts, I even parlayed my love of yoga into a three-month stint as a front desk receptionist at a studio in SoHo. In exchange for three hours of dedication a week, I got to take unlimited classes from some of the best yoga teachers I've ever had.\n\nAside from yoga, I also signed up with my roommate to volunteer within my Muslim community and teach religious education classes to kids.\n\nGrowing up, I loved attending these classes; it connected me to my culture and was also how my roommate and I met as kids. So, participating in this has felt like a full-circle moment that I likely wouldn't have had if I were already working full-time.\n\nHowever, despite finding a great community, I've found my feelings of imposter syndrome are still present — fueled by the overwhelming chaos and fast-paced energy of the city.\n\nOver the last few months, I've learned NYC isn't the best place for me — at least not right now.\n\nI always come home feeling like I haven't done enough, and it exhausts me. This is partially a result of my mindset, but I also think it's a direct consequence of living in a place known for its hustle.\n\nAlthough living here has been a great experience and played a huge role in helping me gain confidence, I'm ready for somewhere that's slower-paced.\n\nThere are, of course, still days when I struggle with my own self-talk and understanding my purpose, but I'm confident a move is the best next step for me as I continue working toward my goals and exploring all of the other things that make me who I am.\n\nMy time in the industry will come, and until then, I'll keep side-questing and doing everything I can to remain happy and present.",

    "fullText": "Former New York City Mayor Eric Adams was a bullish proponent of crypto during his time in office, but an ill-fated meme coin debut this week has drawn outcry.\n\nOn January 12, Adams shared a post on his X account announcing the launch of NYC Token, a New York-themed token with no official ties to the city, but which creators said on the token's website would go toward \"critical initiatives.\" Adams said some proceeds would go toward fighting antisemitism and blockchain education for kids.\n\nAs it started trading, the coin quickly surged to a market cap of roughly $580 million before suddenly reversing course and plunging more than 80% in a few minutes.\n\nOutrage from the crypto community has been swift this week.\n\nThe episode drew accusations that investors had been victims of a \"rug pull,\" in which a token's major holders sell after an initial surge, leaving investors locked into their positions and unable to exit without losing money.\n\nWhile NYC Token rose slightly on its second day of trading, accusations that either Adams or the token's creators had \"rugged\" investors continued to swirl. Legal filings show that the company behind NYC Token, c18 digital LLC, was formed in Delaware two weeks ago.\n\nAn anonymous crypto influencer on X shared several posts saying liquidity had been pulled before NYC Token's plunge, with screenshots to illustrate, and users posted that they believed Adams had profited from the scheme.\n\n\"This has to be the fastest rug pull I've ever seen,\" said one user on X\n\nFor others, the sense of schadenfreude was strong as they watched meme coin investors caught in another high-profile collapse. The episode drew comparisons to Hawk Tuah coin, promoted by viral influencer Haliey Welch. The coin surged before losing 95% of its value shortly after its debut.\n\nA rug pull is usually defined as making a token effectively useless, which in memecoin land often means removing the liquidity needed for holders to sell,\" Haonan Li, founder of stablecoin merchant platform Codex, told Business Insider. That's what appears to have happened in Adam's case—the base layer of liquidity was pulled from the market.\"\n\nAdams could not be reached for comment. Representatives for the token's creators did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nCrypto data platform CoinGecko was still flagging the NYC Token as high risk on Wednesday. It posted the following disclaimer on the token's page:\n\n\"According to Rugcheck.xyz, there is a risk of market manipulation due to large concentration of tokens held in one or more unidentified wallets. Please use caution.\"",

    "fullText": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says he expects Republican President Donald Trump to try to interfere with the midterm elections, and he says raids by immigration agents in major cities are creating a sense of chaos that voters will reject in November.\n\nThe comments were part of a wide-ranging, 20-minute Associated Press telephone interview with the New York Democrat, who argued former Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola's entry into the Senate race gives his party a path to the majority.\n\nSchumer said that economic concerns have begun to cement in the minds of voters and that Democrats have plans to build their campaign around the costs, chaos and corruption they attribute to the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House has called such Democratic statements “fearmongering” to score political points.\n\nThis is an edited transcript of the interview.\n\nQ: Some are predicting Trump will try to prevent an open and fair midterm election and would be expected to dispute the results. Do you share those concerns?\n\nA: We share them, and we already have teams of both senators and lawyers looking at every way that Trump could try to screw things up, and we’re fighting against it. We already have a team to make sure that they count the votes fairly. And, remember, still, a lot of the election mechanisms are done by the states. And even in red states, there’s resistance to Trump interfering.\n\nTrump will do whatever it takes, and he has no honor and no credibility and no respect for law. But, we are prepared for it, and we believe we will succeed.\n\nInfluence of ICE raids on election\n\nQ: What impact do you think the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids are having on the midterms early on?\n\nA: People don’t like chaos. They see that cities and mayors who were perfectly calm and safe are now undergoing all of this chaos. And, you know, as I said, cost is number one. But it’s costs, corruption and chaos. The people don’t like it. And Trump, at the same time he's saying he wants to protect the protesters in Iran, he is going after protesters and other innocent civilians in Minneapolis. Makes no sense to people.\n\nQ: Does it seem to you like economic factors that are dissatisfying to a lot of the voting public are durable in this election year?\n\nA: Absolutely. The number one thing that bothers American families is they can't pay all the bills.\n\nThe costs is the number one issue. The cost of living, affordability, call it what you will. But it’s the number one issue, and now they realize that Trump is screwing them up on all of this.\n\nOn health care, with not extending the ACA tax credits, on energy, by getting rid of clean energy, wind and solar, raising their electric bills with tariffs, which is making the price of everything go up. So, people now realize that Trump is hurting them.\n\nWe are going to focus on five issues in terms of lowering people’s costs. They are health care, housing, tariffs — you know, costs of goods — food prices, because of food monopolies, and child care.\n\nTrump and the Republicans are in a bubble, and they don't understand it. They are ignoring it, and that's why things keep getting better and better for us.\n\nMidterm congressional environment\n\nQ: If we are looking at, in the House, 25 to 30 seats changing hands, is there a direct correlation to what can happen in the Senate?\n\nA: Look, at the beginning of (last) year, people said, “Well, there's a chance to win the House and no chance to win the Senate.” But because of the issues that I've talked about and because the House and Senate have been largely in sync on those issues and it's resonating with the American people how we're on their side, I think that the difference between the likelihood of winning the House and the likelihood of winning the Senate has greatly decreased.\n\nQ: Yet at this very moment, at the beginning of the midterm year, would you agree that Democrats have a narrow path back to the Senate majority?\n\nA: I say it is a much wider path than the skeptics think, and a much wider path than it was three months ago and certainly a year ago. And it keeps getting better and better, and we think we have a really good chance of winning back the Senate.\n\nYounger, non-white Trump voters\n\nQ: Younger and non-white voters drifted toward Trump in the last election, as you know. What is your plan, and what will it take for Democrats to win them over?\n\nA: The cost issue is really having an effect already. Look at the elections of 2025. Look at how (Democrat Abigail) Spanberger won by 15 points in Virginia and (Democrat Mikie) Sherrill won by 13 points (in 2025 governor's races). But it wasn't just those two states. We won elections in Georgia. We won elections across the country. And that is because voters, young and old, poor and middle class, don't think Trump was serving them well. So, there's been a whole turnaround about Trump.\n\nAnd in large part, we helped make it happen by focusing on costs.\n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants are expected to interview recently fired Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh by the end of the weekend as part of their search for a permanent replacement for Brian Daboll, who was dismissed in November.\n\nJohn Harbaugh update: By the end of the weekend, he plans to meet with the Giants, Falcons and Titans. I'm told Harbaugh is encouraged that John Mara, who is battling cancer, plans to be in the office when he gets together with the Giants. Also, kind of cool that Eli reached out…\n\n— Gary Myers (@GaryMyersNY) January 14, 2026\n\nHarbaugh, who spent 18 seasons in Baltimore and won a Super Bowl, has emerged as a top target for general manager Joe Schoen, who has been described as “relentless” in his pursuit of the veteran coach.\n\nReports indicate the Giants are among Harbaugh’s preferred destinations alongside the Atlanta Falcons and Tennessee Titans, and the organization has remained in close contact ahead of the anticipated meeting.\n\nHarbaugh has been selective with interviews and may require personnel influence in any new role. The Giants could interview him in Baltimore if Harbaugh prefers to host candidates there, but early indications are the meeting will take place in East Rutherford.\n\nHarbaugh has already begun studying film on quarterback Jaxson Dart, signaling serious interest in the Giants’ roster.\n\nWith Schoen retained for 2026 and tasked with leading the search, the Giants are also considering other candidates but appear heavily focused on landing the experienced Harbaugh.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: John Harbaugh plans to meet with New York Giants by end of weekend",

    "fullText": "The New York high school boys basketball 2025-26 campaign is heating up around the Empire State as the drive towards the postseason officially begins.\n\nTaking back over the No. 1 spot in our latest New York high school boys basketball rankings are the \nArchbishop Stepinac Crusaders, which are off to a 9-4 start playing against some of the best competition in the country. Top two teams are both Crusaders, but who else should we watch for out of New York when it comes to the state’s top high school boys basketball teams?\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory.\n\nHere’s a way-too-early look at the top 25 teams in the country according to the Massey Ratings, which ranks teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule and margin of victory, as of Jan. 14.\n\nIf you take one look at the roster Archbishop Stepinac (9-4) and you’ll easily see why the Crusaders are near the head of the table in New York. This season, the Crusaders bring back a very senior-laden bunch and super talented in the front and back court. Senior four-star shooting guard Jasiah Jervis returns after averaging a team-high 16.2 points per game last season. The Crusaders will be tough to drive to the rim on as they have a pair of USC commits in 7-footers in Adonis and Darius Ratliff, respectively. Fordham commitment Hassan Koureissi pairs up with Jervis to create one of the best guard combos in the Northeast. This Saturday, Archbishop Stepanic will be taking on one of the top programs in the country in Notre Dame (Calif.).\n\nOne of New York’s top high school boys basketball teams is the Long Island Lutheran Crusaders (5-5) as they feature one of the best overall rosters in the country once again. Though the Crusaders dropped their fifth game of the season recently to CIA Bella Vista Prep, they have played elite competition thus far. What is obvious when taking a look at the talent pool the Crusaders possesses, this team can compete with practically anyone in the nation. Long Island Lutheran has multiple five-star talents in senior 6-foot-5 point guard Dylan Mingo and junior 6-foot-8 forward Moussa Kamissoko. Among other players folks need to have their eyes on that lace ’em up for the Crusaders are Cincinnati commitment Kayden Allen and North Texas pledge TJ Crumble. Long Island Lutheran will be facing Compass Prep (Ariz.) and Montverde Academy (Fla.) at the Hoophall Classic in Massachusetts.\n\nThe St. Francis Preparatory School Terriers (10-2) have continued with their winning ways as they return one of the more talented teams in the New York City region. Key players returning for the Terriers begins with Oesoemana Sacko, who is already committed to Fairfield University, and 6-foot-3 sophomore Justin DeSena. The Terriers’ only two losses on the season have come against Colorado’s No. 1 ranked Ralston Valley and No. 3 Christ The King Regional, respectively.\n\nOne of the top teams out of New York high school boys basketball is Christ The King Regional (9-2), which finished with a 16-14 record last year. The Lions bring back a talented lineup, which includes 2028 three-star point guard Skye Ragoo, who has an offer currently from St. John’s. Playing one of the tougher schedules in the state, Christ the King Regional has already notched some impressive wins, including recently over No. 5 St. Francis Prep. The Lions’ latest game, though, was a 76-66 loss to No. 18 ranked Xaverian (N.Y.).\n\nThe Nazareth Kingsmen (10-5) of Brooklyn enter the Top 5 of our latest New York high school boys basketball rankings this week as this group has really come on hot as of late. Of Nazareth’s losses this season, two of them have come against Archbishop Molloy, but the Kingsmen were able to notch their first victory versus the Stanners. A matchup against No. 2 Archbishop Stepinac last Saturday ended in a 83-61 loss for the Kingsmen as they look to bounce back tonight against No. 3 ranked St. Francis Prep.\n\n6. Cardinal Hayes Cardinals (6-4)\n7. Iona Preparatory School Gaels (8-6) \n8. Thomas Jefferson Campus Orange Wave (7-5) \n9. St. Raymond For Boys Ravens (5-7)\n10. Poly Prep Blue Devils (1-1)\n\n11. Albany Academy Cadets (2-1)\n12. Archbishop Molloy Stanners (10-6) \n13. Lawrence Woodmere Academy Tigers (0-0)\n14. Christian Brothers Academy Brothers (7-0)\n15. St. John’s Prep Red Storm (5-0)\n\n16. Fairport Red Raiders (7-0)\n17. Xaverian Clippers (6-3)\n18. Westhill Warriors (9-1)\n19. South Shore Vikings (7-5)\n20. Shaker Bison (8-2)\n\n21. Msgr Scanlan Crusaders (8-4) \n22. Chaminade Flyers (6-4) \n23. Canarsie Wolfpack (9-4) \n24. Mount Vernon (5-2)\n25. Shenendehowa Plainsmen (8-1)\n\nFor New York high school boys basketball fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard. This comprehensive resource provides real-time updates and final scores from across the Empire State, ensuring you never miss a moment of the high school hops action throughout the season.

    "fullText": "Jets predicted to trade for $212 million QB in lieu of Dante Moore originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAssuming that Fernando Mendoza is the No. 1 overall NFL Draft pick by the Las Vegas Raiders, the New York Jets will have to cross their fingers.\n\nDante Moore isn't a lock to come out of Oregon and enter the draft. He'd be the only clear QB2 in a class that isn't as strong as once thought.\n\nIf Moore stays in school, the Jets may have to pursue a different route at the quarterback position.\n\nBleacher Report's Alex Ballentine suggests an outside the box option: Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nTagovailoa has multiple years remaining on what was originally a $212 million contract with the Miami Dolphins. It'd be a fascinating intra-division trade.\n\nBecause it'd be a salary dump, the Jets in this projected trade actually also receive a second-round pick and cash while only giving up a fifth-round pick.\n\n\"For all of Tua Tagovailoa's faults, he is 44-32 as a starter,\" Ballentine writes. \"Tagovailoa said he would be open to a fresh start after a season in which he ended on the bench. The only problem is that he's only one year into his four-year extension. The Jets are uniquely positioned to help the Dolphins out. They have $93.7 million in cap space, which is plenty to take on a significant portion of Tagovailoa's contract before cutting it in 2027 with little additional cost. That would help the Jets win now while adding to their draft pick stockpile and showing some creativity in navigating their rebuild under Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey.\"\n\nMIKE TOMLIN NEWS: What it means for Rodgers | TV future | Tomlin trade potential | Cignetti?\n\nIt would certainly be fascinating to see the Jets' leadership group put their futures in the hands of Tagovailoa.\n\nIt's hard to know if Tua could be good enough without a talented receiving corps, but maybe he needs the change of scenery more than anything else.\n\nThe narratives would be great if this happened, for sure.\n\nPatriots, Drake Maye silence doubters with callback to Brady, Belichick\n\nA.J.

    "description": "Taking a look at a Jets cornerback",
    "fullText": "Over the next few months, we’ll be taking an in-depth look at some of the late season signings who are under contract for 2026, and futures signings after the end of the season. We continue today with cornerback Samuel Womack, who signed a futures deal on the day after the season ended, having been elevated from the practice squad to start the season finale.\n\nThe 26-year old Womack is listed at 5’10” and 189 pounds and was a fifth round pick out of Toledo in 2022. He has started 11 games in his career so far, including eight with the Colts in 2024, and has racked up 73 tackles, 13 pass breakups and three interceptions in 46 career games.\n\nWomack was a productive receiver and cornerback in high school but wasn’t ranked by any of the main outlets so he had to walk on at Toledo. However, he saw action in seven games as a true freshman and recorded four tackles and an interception.\n\nHe continued to play a rotational role in 2018 but did make his first career start as he had 12 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss and a pass breakup in 13 games.\n\nOver the next three years, Womack moved into a starting role and was productive as he had 59 tackles, 15 pass breakups and two interceptions in 2019 followed by 20 tackles and eight pass breakups in just six games in 2020. He was then named as a first-team all-MAC selection in his final season in 2021 as he had 32 tackles, 18 passes defensed and two more interceptions.\n\nDespite not being invited to the scouting combine, Womack had a good pro day and was ultimately drafted by the 49ers in the fifth round.\n\nAs a rookie, Womack made one start and ended the season with 19 tackles, an interception and a forced fumble. However, his second season was disrupted by injuries and he had just seven tackles in seven games.\n\nHaving been released in final cuts by the 49ers after the 2024 preseason, he was claimed on waivers by the Colts and made a good impact with them as he had an excellent season. He started eight games and racked up 36 tackles, nine pass breakups and two interceptions.\n\nDespite this, he failed to make the roster in 2025 and ended up on the Titans for whom he made five appearances including one start. He had four tackles and a pass breakup. However, he was waived again in November and ended up on the Jets’ practice squad in December.\n\nWomack didn’t play until the season finale but was in on every snap and had seven tackles and a pass breakup in a solid performance and then signed a futures deal the next day.\n\nLet’s move onto some more in-depth analysis of what Womack brings to the table as a player, based on extensive research and film study.\n\nWomack has average size and length but posted some good numbers at his pro day where he ran a 4.40 in the 40-yard dash and managed a 36-inch vertical jump and solid agility numbers. His broad jump was below average and he did not participate in the bench press.\n\nWomack primarily played on the outside during his career, but he did see extensive action in the slot in a couple of games in his final season at Toledo and then got some work there with the 49ers in his rookie year both in preseason and the regular season. He also played there in preseason in 2024.\n\nWith the Colts and Titans, and with the Jets in the season finale, he played exclusively outside.\n\nWomack’s coverage numbers in college were excellent as he allowed a catch on less than half of his targets and never got beaten for more than four touchdowns in a season.\n\nAt the NFL level, he has given up nine touchdowns in his career, including six in 2024 alone. However, at some points during that season he was ranking among the league leaders in categories such as forced incompletion rate and snaps per reception allowed.\n\nHis balance, anticipation and movement skills are good and his film shows plenty of examples of being able to stay with his man.\n\nHis biggest issue seems to be inconsistent footwork, which can lead to him being beaten off the line.\n\nWhile he can run stride for stride with receivers on deep routes, he can struggle to recover when a bigger receiver gets a clean release off the line.\n\nWomack posted spectacular on-ball numbers in college. In fact, he is ranked 11th all-time in NCAA history for passes defensed despite only having three seasons (one of them pandemic-shortened) as a starter. He led the MAC three straight years in that category and twice placed in the top-four in the nation.\n\nHe showcased his timing and ability to disrupt on this play in the season finale, where he played the defender’s hands to perfection.\n\nIn terms of interceptions, which is of course something the Jets are desperate to add to their team, Womack had five in college and has three in regular season action at the NFL level. He also had two \n\nWhile run defense isn’t a major part of Womack’s game as an outside corner, it’s something he got better at over the course of his college career and it hasn’t proved to be a weakness for him at the pro level as some analysts anticipated.\n\nMissed tackles were another thing that some analysts thought might be an issue for Womack at the pro level, due to his average size and a perceived lack of play strength. This was despite the fact his tackle efficiency numbers in college weren’t too bad. Again, though, this hasn’t really been a problem in the pros, although he has had five missed tackles, all in 2024.\n\nHe had one forced fumble in his rookie season.\n\nAt times, Womack has used his hands well to jam at the line or redirect within five yards of the line of scrimmage, although this wasn’t really his primary role with the Colts or Titans.\n\nHe had 13 penalties during his college career with some analysts picking up on the fact that he would grab from time to time. However, he only has one defensive holding and one pass interference penalty at the pro level.\n\nAlthough he isn’t big, he is capable of making some aggressive tackles.\n\nWomack has hardly ever blitzed at the NFL level, although he did have a quarterback hit in a preseason game. He had this half-sack in college.\n\nWomack has had plenty of experience on all the main special teams units including as a vice on the punt return team and a gunner on punt coverage.\n\nHe wasn’t that productive in college, where he had as many penalties (three) as special teams tackles, but he has nine special teams tackles at the NFL level and made this impressive play at the goal line.\n\nHe did false start once on a punt though.\n\nWomack has displayed an ability to make quick reads and come up to make plays close to the line of scrimmage. In addition, he looks comfortable in terms of his assignment responsibilities in zone coverage.\n\nAs a former walk-on, Womack has displayed determination to get to this level and has been similarly defiant when released by the 49ers, Colts and Titans. He believes he deserves more of a chance to show what he can do and brings good energy and communication skills.\n\nOn-field discipline hasn’t been an issue with just three defensive penalties at the NFL level, although one was for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nWomack spent five weeks on injured reserve in 2023, then returned in November, after suffering an MCL sprain in his knee. Otherwise, he has only been affected by minor injuries and illness during his career so far.\n\nIt was surprising to see Womack unable to make the Colts roster this year after a strong 2024 season, but he reportedly really struggled in Lou Anarumo’s new system.\n\nThat scheme sees the Colts mix up their coverages and packages a lot more than in the past and Womack apparently struggled in camp with giving up catches and penalties.\n\nHe perhaps looked at his most confident when playing in the Colts’ zone heavy schemes but he has handled man and press assignments in the past so it may have been the multiple nature of the system that he struggled to get to grips with.\n\nHe was a teammate of current Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell with the Colts.\n\nWomack’s performance in the season finale stood out as a rare bright spot for the Jets that day, and going back over his career so far suggests that he has some ability and potential that could give him a realistic shot at a roster spot with the Jets next season.\n\nAaron Glenn has brought in a series of defensive backs that he says fits what the Jets do and Womack slotted right into the lineup and did a solid job which sets him up well to perform at training camp next season.\n\nOf course, we don’t know who the new defensive coordinator is going to be and, judging by what happened in Indianapolis, there’s a chance Womack might not fit in as well after this change is made. However, based on his talent alone, it’s too soon to write off Womack as a replacement level player and the Jets may have made a shrewd acquisition of an overlooked cornerback who could prove useful.",

    "description": "Two of the NFL's least successful teams are working with multiple first round picks in 2026. How could Cleveland and New York fix things?",
    "fullText": "For three quarters of the NFL, the 2026 offseason has begun. That means Super Bowl hopes and dreams have been replaced by scouting reports and salary cap debates.\n\nThat means, for 24 teams, it's draft season.\n\nThe 2026 NFL Draft is modest when it comes to quarterback talent but still loaded with players who can change the fortunes of a franchise. Pass rushers, wideouts, cornerbacks and reinforcements on both sides of the trenches are waiting to hear their names called in April. Let's see who fits where and make some educated guesses.\n\nPlease note this draft was completed before Monday night's Wild Card game between the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers, so draft position among the top 24 picks was determined using the betting spread of that game (a projected three-point Texans win).\n\nGeno Smith can be kept for about $8 million more than his dead cap number. While he might be a useful veteran mentor, he's also the guy who flipped off his home fans in his first year in Las Vegas, so... Aidan O'Connell will probably be the experienced (well, kinda) hand that turns things over to a polished rookie next August.\n\nMendoza's elite downfield accuracy means he'll dazzle when it comes to advanced stats like completion percentage over expected (CPOE). He balances pinpoint throws with strong, quick decision making and enough athleticism to keep defenses wary of his run game. While he lacks elite physical traits, you can't argue with his outcomes. Las Vegas needs a winner -- ideally immediately given how quickly it's cycled through head coaches. Mendoza has been wrecking shop at INDIANA.\n\nMoore has more physical tools in his box than Mendoza, but he's not as polished as the Heisman Trophy winner. Still, it's not difficult to see how a quick release and the arm strength to whip a deep shot through a rapidly closing window make him a tantalizing NFL prospect.\n\nThe Oregon star can break down under pressure and will need some time to acclimate to the NFL. Picking up a wideout with the pick acquired from the Colts in the Sauce Gardner trade (or, later on, the second round acquired from the Cowboys in the Quinnen Williams trade) could find him some badly needed receiving help to ease his transition.\n\nJosh Sweat was one of the few bright spots in Arizona last fall, racking up a career-high 12 sacks in his first season with the club. Only one other Cardinal had more than two, and that was 39-year-old Calais Campbell.\n\nArizona needs help just about everywhere but tight end. Reese's versatility can help him plug holes in a few places along the defense but most notably as a pass rusher. He had 10 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks in his All-American 2025.\n\nTexas Tech stud David Bailey is worth a look here, but Bain's playoff performance is too fresh to ignore. The 6-foot-3, 275 pound edge rushing monster had 5.5 tackles for loss and four sacks in the Hurricanes' first two CFP games, setting the stage for a push even further up draft boards.\n\nHis get-off and closing speed hit like a series of small explosions, making him an absolute nightmare to block and a haunting presence to escape. The Titans badly need an influx of talent; Bain may be the best raw prospect of 2026.\n\nTate's ability to create space with savvy route running, strong hands and upper crust ball tracking would be a rising tide for New York's cache of young skill players. Malik Nabers' double-teams would drop. Cam Skattebo (and Tyrone Tracy, if he ever re-enters the circle of trust) would face fewer stacked boxes.\n\nAnd Jaxson Dart, importantly, would have more options downfield that don't require him to lower his shoulder and run face-first into the concussion protocol (he probably still will. He just won't *have* to). Wideout isn't the team's biggest need, but it could be the catalyst that revives an inefficient offense.\n\nThe Browns allowed pressure on a league-high 46.5 percent of their dropbacks -- four percent higher than the second-worst Chargers, who were missing their starting tackles most of the season. Four different linemen who played at least 69 percent of the team's snaps are set for free agency. Spending room is sparse, in large part thanks to Deshaun Watson, formerly accused of more than 20 counts of sexual misconduct and what the NFL described as \"predatory behavior,\" and his albatross contract.\n\nThe easiest fix is to find a dynamic starter on a rookie deal. Here, Cleveland has its choice. Fano gets the nod thanks to his absurd power and athleticism at 6-foot-6 and 305 pounds. That athleticism boosts his recovery when beaten, which will be an asset when squaring up with rookie mistakes and elite edge rushers.\n\nTerry McLaurin is locked in, but Jayden Daniels' targets get iffy after that. Deebo Samuel is a pending free agent. So is Zach Ertz, who is coming off a season-ending ACL tear. Daniels badly needs a boost after backsliding in 2025 due to injury and lackluster play.\n\nTyson is a jetpack. The Arizona State star is good at just about everything, but shines hardest when it comes to breaking off cornerbacks at the top of his route and creating the space for clutch pickups. Sticky hands and elite recognition make him a dynamic closer on 50/50 balls as well -- though he could stand to bulk up a bit to withstand the rigors of a 17-game season.\n\nNeeds: CB, IOL, EDGE, LB, RB, WR\n\nNew Orleans could have used Tate or Tyson. Taking a player like Makai Lemon or Denzel Boston could be a bit of a reach here. Good news! The Saints also need help at another position that would boost Tyler Shough after a promising rookie season.\n\nEnter Love, who'd be a boon to a tailback rotation that got below-average returns from Alvin Kamara and Devin Neal last fall. His value as a runner (nearly seven yards per carry the last two seasons) and receiver (280 yards, three touchdowns in 12 games this fall) give New Orleans a dynamic replacement for Kamara and rising tide to the offense, albeit at considerable expense for a running back.\n\nReleasing Jawaan Taylor could save up to $20 million in salary cap space for 2026. Jaylon Moore hasn't been great and is only under contract through 2026. Josh Simmons was uneven and injured as a rookie, though his ceiling is massive. After Patrick Mahomes faced pressure on at least 42 percent of his dropbacks in his final two games of his 2025 (two games that washed Kansas City out of the postseason race), the Chiefs reload to keep their star QB comfortable.\n\nMauigoa is a rampart in pass protection, but he's truly devastating in space where his 315-pound frame flies upfield to demolish poor, poor linebackers. He's in the running with Fano to be the first tackle off the board in 2026.\n\nTrey Hendrickson won't be coming back, leaving the league's 25th-ranked pass rush in dire need. Maybe 2025 first round pick Shemar Stewart will get there, but he was always a project whose growth was further stunted by a truly pointless contract standoff last season.\n\nBailey brings proven production that Stewart did not, racking up a Big 12-leading 19.5 tackles for loss and an FBS-leading 14.5 sacks after departing Stanford for a hefty payday at Texas Tech. His explosive get-off and devastating closing speed means he can man the second level, but at 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds he's not so small he can't handle edge duties in Ohio (Joseph Ossai, for example, only has an inch and about 15 pounds on him). He's not a perfect fit, but Cincinnati gets a chance to course correct by taking an NFL-ready pass rusher in the first round.\n\nIn theory, Miami's next coach could use this pick to pump up his offense with another athletic marvel and make tight end Kenyon Sadiq a Dolphin. But whomever succeeds Mike McDaniel badly needs to address the league's 25th-ranked defense. And, lo and behold, Miami has a need at safety and Downs has slid out of the top 10.\n\nDowns can play deep or near the line of scrimmage and line up tracking slot receivers with ease. His NFL ceiling is \"Brian Branch, but better.\" He's a fixer, plain and simple, in a Miami defense in need of playmakers.\n\nDoes Jerry Jones truly want to shore up his run defense? If so, Clemson's Peter Woods could be the call here. Is he in the market for a Trevon Diggs replacement? There's Mansoor Delane and Jermod McCoy, among others. But the combination of need and cost savings at a high cost position instead shift the focus to Faulk, a high potential pass rusher who could lift a team that went from a top-four pressure rate with Micah Parsons in the lineup to the middle of the NFL pack without him.\n\nFaulk brings proven production (seven sacks in 2024 before this fall's down year) and the size Cincinnati covets up front (6-foot-6, 285 pounds). He's not a one-dimensional edge rusher, either; he has legitimate chops on the ground for a defense that ranked 29th in rushing EPA allowed in 2025.\n\nThe Rams only have three pending free agents who played more than 50 percent of the teams snaps on offense or defense. All three are defensive backs, including Cobie Durant. Darious Williams is 32 years old. 2026 presents a wonderful opportunity for LA to take the draft's first cornerback.\n\nEnter Delane, who led the SEC with 11 pass breakups and hauled in a pair of interceptions in 11 games. He can be trusted in single coverage on the sideline, with fluid hips and turn-and-go speed to keep up with NFL deep threats. His trustworthiness on an island could mean more blitzes for the Rams -- and an even scarier defense.\n\nThis is a pick that may hinge on Baltimore's next head coach. But this is a franchise with a definite identity. Landing a hoss like Woods who can set a bruising tone up front would help the Ravens get back to it.\n\nWoods, a 315-pound fairy tale monster with absurd quickness and athleticism, is set to jump up draft boards at the 2026 Scouting Combine. He lands in the top half of the draft here, pairing with Justin Madubuike to give Baltimore some world-class BEEF in the middle of its line and make life easier for the defenders behind them.\n\nLavonte David cannot possibly keep doing this forever. Please welcome his replacement, a taller, faster version of Lavonte David.\n\nStyles is a former safety who plays like it (complimentary), using elite athleticism to create problems at every level. He has the speed to turn and run with slot receivers and the physicality to meet a running back at the line of scrimmage and leave him with nothing but regret.\n\nWith Moore on board, several options to punch up his receiving corps persist. But while solid wideouts will last into Day 2, there may only be one chance to draft 2026's top tight end. With apologies to Denzel Boston and Makai Lemon, Sadiq is the pick.\n\nThe Oregon tight end is an athletic marvel and solid blocker who can seal off running lanes or get out in space to deflect defensive backs. More importantly, he's got excellent speed up the seam and quick change-of-direction skills to snap off linebackers and slot corners. Pair that with solid hands and, baby, you've got a stew going.\n\nDetroit needs a pass rusher big enough to hold down the edge and the intelligence to react and adjust as plays unfold. The 6-foot-3, 265 pound Parker qualifies as a valuable counterweight to Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nThough his numbers tailed off after last year's absurd 19.5-TFL, 11-sack campaign, he remains a versatile piece with a high ceiling and useful floor. He's violent at the point of attack, using a quick punch and active hands to shed blockers, though he's fast enough to win with speed on the edge as well.\n\nByron Murphy and Isaiah Rodgers played well in 2025, but there's no such thing as too many talented quarterbacks in a defense as aggressive as Brian Flores'. Adding McCoy would create space to shift Rodgers to the slot, adding strength over the middle alongside a young player who can be trusted on the boundary.\n\nMcCoy's torn ACL kept him from shining in 2025, but his four-interception 2024 proved he's a shadow in coverage, rarely allowing space thanks to fluid hips, elite quickness and vital recognition skills. He's an asset in man coverage from the line of scrimmage, and erasing quick-outs is a specialty -- something that would be a boon for the Vikings' pressure in the pocket.\n\nThe Panthers are running out of time to decide whether Bryce Young can be their franchise quarterback. After Tetairoa McMillan and Jalen Coker made up 81 percent of their receiving output in a Wild Card loss to the Rams, it's clear Carolina could use help to maximize its young passer.\n\nLemon's size at 5-foot-10 is a concern, but putting him in a lineup across from 6-foot-4 McMillan and 6-foot-3 Coker alleviates that. More importantly, he gives the team another man coverage beater with elite acceleration and quickness who can thrive in the short/intermediate zone in the space McMillan creates.\n\nOhio State's Kayden McDonald could be an answer up front with Kenny Clark on the wrong side of 30. But cornerback is a more pressing need and a top-three prospect has slid into Dallas' range.\n\nNot a single defensive back in the Cowboys locker room finished 2025 with a passer rating under 99 when targeted. Terrell, with 22 breakups the last two seasons (and eight! forced! fumbles!) would be rain to that desert. With elite acceleration and lateral movement, he's difficult to shake -- even if he's a bit smaller than Jerry Jones might prefer at under six feet tall.\n\nSure, a quarterback would be nice here -- but Ty Simpson here feels destined to end up like Kenny Pickett before him. It could be a wideout, but with Lemon off the board Pittsburgh may opt to play into tradition and coach up a receiver selected on Day 2 instead. Thus, we get Banks, a massive lineman who can play multiple roles but, most importantly, can succeed Cameron Heyward and pair with Derrick Harmon and Keeanu Benton to give the Steelers' a terrifying young defensive front.\n\nBanks has to refine his game, but his raw talent would make him a tantalizing lump of clay for a franchise that's expertly molded defensive talent. He's explosive at the snap and elusive laterally, allowing him to shed blocks and contribute all three downs. While injury limited him to three games this season and dented his draft stock, he may be due for a pre-draft rise this spring.\n\nZion Johnson has been frustrating in his time as a Charger and headed to free agency. Jim Harbaugh can pluck a Big Ten star to replace him months after the Patriots ended his season by brutalizing poor Justin Herbert.\n\nIoane, Iowa's Gennings Dunker or Oregon's Emmanuel Pregnon could be the call here, but let's start with the Nittany Lion. He's a brick wall at 330 pounds and has the quickness and aggression to create space at the second level -- something Jim Harbaugh will absolutely love as he establishes the run.\n\nThe Eagles haven't been shy about taking a legendary offensive lineman's replacement early in the draft while he's still on the roster. Cam Jurgens was drafted in 2022 to take over for Jason Kelce. Now comes Lomu ahead of whatever Lane Johnson decides comes next.\n\nPhiladelphia's pressure rate allowed actually decreased between 2024 and 2025, but all was not well across an offensive front whose struggles tied into an overall regression this fall. Lomu is a high level athlete who adjusted to Big 12 play with aplomb, showcasing All-Pro upside for the right head coach. Given the Eagles' success with homegrown and retread blockers in the past, his upside is too much to pass up.\n\nWith a blocking upgrade secured in the top 10, the Browns take the next step to elevate whichever poor, unfortunate soul has to play quarterback next season. It's too early to write off Jerry Jeudy even after his disastrous 2025. Instead, he gets a little help -- and another big body alongside Harold Fannin Jr. to serve as a playmaking threat.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Boston is a bail out machine on jump balls, but his biggest strength comes breaking off defenders in the mid-range. That would make him kind of a super-sized Kayshon Boutte. We've seen how nicely Drake Maye has leaned on Boutte en route to an All-Pro second season, correct?\n\nThe draft board has been kind to the Bears -- even at No. 25 they have a wide array of top-level prospects to choose from at positions of need. Secondary and offensive line help is waiting, but Howell's value for the league's 27th-ranked pass rush is massive.\n\nHowell led the SEC with 11 sacks. While he doesn't have an enormous frame at 6-foot-2 and 250 pounds, his versatile pass rushing attack makes him an asset even in Chicago's 4-3 alignment. His ability to use his speed to create leverage and then toss off blockers suggests he could help fix what ails the Bears.\n\nBuffalo could fall in love with a wideout here, but there will be time to address the position on Day 2. Finding a young stud who can keep the middle of the line chugging forward with both Connor McGovern and David Edwards headed to free agency, however, is a tougher call. Dunker could step in immediately to pair with O'Cyrus Torrence as a road-grading young duo at guard.\n\nThe Iowa tackle will likely kick inside due to his arm length but can hold his own on the edge if needed. More importantly, he's mean as hell, quick at the point of attack and difficult to move backward. So, pretty standard Hawkeye stuff.\n\nTrent Williams has to retire someday. We saw how lost the Niners looked without him in stretches in 2025. The Niners' postseason success has prevented them from at least a couple potential saviors earlier in round one, but they still get a good one here. Proctor is enormous; 6-foot-7 and more than 360 pounds.\n\nHe's got the strength to match that frame, but his athleticism belongs to a much smaller man -- including a 32-inch vertical leap despite being the same weight as a Smart car. He's solid as a shadow, and while pad level and lateral quickness will always be a concern with a player his size he should make an immediate impact if Williams doesn't return for 2026.\n\nAh crap, we let the Texans get another elite defensive prospect. McDonald is an anchor up front, damn near impossible to move at 326 pounds. But he's also blessed with an explosive opening salvo that fires him into gaps and shrinks pocket space from the inside-out. Now he gets to pair up with Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter.\n\nCould this be a spot for Alabama's Ty Simpson to serve as Matthew Stafford's apprentice? It's possible, but Allen's availability and the need to add dynamic, young athletic talent to the middle of the field makes the Georgia linebacker the pick.\n\nAllen can handle pass rushing duties as well as lock down the middle of the field in coverage or against the run. He's not huge at 6-foot-1 and 235 pounds, but he moves quickly and fluidity, rarely crossing himself up and sticking to receivers in coverage. He's also a bonafide thumper who can move Omar Speights into pending free agent Troy Reeder's role as a rotational presence.\n\nNew England's pass rush was a strength in its Wild Card win over the Chargers, but K'Lavon Chaisson is a free agent and Harold Landry turns 30 this summer. Reloading here would help create positional savings that will be vital once Drake Maye signs a record-setting contract extension.\n\nUiagalelei can break into the lineup as a pass rushing specialist while fleshing out his game. He's an athletic marvel who looks the part of an NFL star but still needs to refine his game. But with power and speed in droves, he'd bring a stable floor to a position of need for Mike Vrabel.\n\nCisse's turn-and-run ability and elite acceleration suggest he's going to be an absolute darling at the combine. That raw athletic ability is backed by an inconsistent approach -- his 78.9 passer rating in Columbia last season was solid but his 20-plus yards allowed per reception were not. Fortunately, he lands here with a head coach capable of extracting the very best from him.\n\nCisse occasionally plays over-excited, biting on double-moves and adding some boom-bust to his game. Mike Macdonald can fix that. If he can, there's a player with All-Pro potential waiting underneath.\n\nAlex Singleton is a pending free agent on the wrong side of 30. Denver needs a running mate next to Dre Greenlaw in the middle of the field. Hill can do that.\n\nThe Texas star is a smart linebacker who identifies plays and gets where he needs to be to stop them. His coverage continues to develop, but that's a weakness that the rest of the Broncos' defense can help cover as he develops it into a strength.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: NFL mock draft: Can Jets, Browns double-dips save their franchises?",

The plan at the time, according to sources, was to send 14 reporters and photographers to Tokyo to produce a separate daily color section, as it first did in 1984 when the games were held in Los Angeles. The Times will be covering next month’s Winter Games in Italy with one writer as Thuc Nhi Nguyen will be taking a break from the Lakers beat to cover the games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nWhen Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018, he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” Since the pandemic in 2020, however, the sports section has been reduced to the final four or five pages of the California section five days a week, with a standalone sports section of six to eight pages appearing only twice per week.\n\nDespite its statewide branding, the California Post's initial sports coverage will be centered squarely on Los Angeles, with a primary emphasis on the sports and teams the Los Angeles Times still covers in the Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA.\n\nHernandez and Harris will lead its MLB and Dodgers coverage, while Southern California News Group Lakers beat writer Khobi Price and longtime Lakers reporter Melissa Rohlin, who joined the Post last week, will anchor its NBA and Lakers coverage. Bonsignore will lead the NFL and Rams coverage while Bolch will lead college sports coverage, focusing on USC and UCLA.\n\nThe staffing losses at the Los Angeles Times come amid continued upheaval at the paper, which has faced newsroom cuts, buyouts and mounting uncertainty about its long-term investment in daily sports coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Post is not done hiring. Sources familiar with the startup’s plans say the outlet is continuing to pursue additional Times sports writers and other well-known local journalists before its launch on Jan. 26.",

    "fullText": "An arrest report revealed new details about a fight in the stands among fans at TD Garden during Saturday’s Boston Bruins-New York Rangers game that resulted in an arrest and hospitalization.\n\nAaron Tucker, 48, of Barre, Vermont, is slated to be arraigned on Friday on a charge of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and assault and battery on a person over the age of 60 in connection with the altercation.\n\nAccording to the arrest report, TD Garden detail officers responded to the arena’s Loge 2 section just after 3 p.m. for a report of an unconscious man who had fallen from the balcony level. After officers spoke with witnesses, they learned the victim was actually pushed while standing on the stairs in the section, causing him to fall backwards.\n\nWhen officers and security personnel located the 60-year-old victim, he was lying on the ground, semi-conscious, and breathing with his eyes slightly open near row AA in club section 113, the report stated. While enroute to Mass General Hospital for the treatment of a head injury, he allegedly told emergency officials that he drank “seven beers” and “had no memory” of the incident.\n\nOne witness told police that the victim was intoxicated and agitating Tucker and a woman he was sitting with, at one point raising his middle finger directly in their faces, according to the report. Another witness said Tucker and the victim continued to heckle each other before the push occurred.\n\n“He [witness] observed the victim continue to inch closer to the suspect and his wife, at which point the suspect grabbed the victim by the neck and pushed him, which caused him to fall backwards down the stairs,” police wrote in the report.\n\nNew video obtained by Boston 25 shows Boston police and EMS responding to the chaotic scene.\n\nTucker was wearing a Rangers hat and jersey, and the victim was harassing other Rangers fans leading up to the push, another witness told police. The victim’s friends had also been trying to get him to leave the arena to avoid continued escalation.\n\n“It shouldn’t happen,” a fan told Boston 25 News. “When the Rangers were here, they beat them 10 to 2; that’s when there are more fights.”\n\nOther witnesses reported seeing Tucker walk off toward the club level after the push as the victim rolled down “three to five” steps to the foyer below.\n\nInvestigators later spotted Tucker on surveillance video leaving the arena on Causeway Street and tracked him to the area of Endicott Street and Lafayette Avenue, where he was taken into custody without incident.\n\nTucker was booked at the Nashua Street Jail and later released on bail.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - New York City nurses walked out of 10 major private hospitals across the city on Monday ​to demand increased staffing, funding of health benefits and protection from workplace violence ‌often coming from patients.\n\nMayor Zohran Mamdani, who is just two weeks into his term, joined the picket lines to ‌support 15,000 nurses that the New York State Nurses Association said were on strike.\n\n\"They are not asking for a multi-million dollar salary. What they are asking is for their pensions to be safeguarded, to be protected in their own workplace, to receive the pay and the health benefits ⁠that they deserve,\" Mamdani told ‌reporters.\n\nMount Sinai said that the union's proposals would cost it $1.6 billion over three years, with a $638 million increase in nursing costs by the third ‍year, which is 74% more than current costs.\n\nNew York State Gov. Kathy Hochul had declared a disaster emergency last week, allowing out-of-state and foreign medical personnel to cover for striking staff. The disaster emergency ​is in effect until February 8.\n\nOn Monday morning, dozens of nurses spoke of lack of ‌healthcare benefits and inability to take adequate breaks during their shifts as they rallied outside a NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in uptown Manhattan. NewYork-Presbyterian is one of three healthcare networks affected by the strike along with Mount Sinai and Montefiore.\n\n\"In the operating room, I work as a night nurse and we're always short on staffing and this is unsafe for the patient,\" said Michael ⁠Lazar, a 53-year-old NewYork-Presbyterian nurse.\n\nMount Sinai said it ​had secured more than 1,000 qualified and specialized agency ​nurses to cover for striking medics and to deliver care for \"however long a strike may last.\"\n\nNewYork-Presbyterian said all of its hospitals were open and continued ‍to provide services.\n\nMontefiore did ⁠not immediately respond to a request for comment. A notice on its website said that services would not be impacted by the strike.\n\nThe union and the hospitals held ⁠the last round of the negotiations the day before the strike, according to Mount Sinai and NYSNA. As ‌of Monday evening, there was no information about the next talks.",

    "description": "The New York Yankees are apparently pursuing Kyle Tucker, but they just received some bad news in that department.",
    "fullText": "The New York Yankees have reportedly moved away from Cody Bellinger and have pivoted to other options in MLB free agency. One of those options? Kyle Tucker.\n\nTucker is the jewel of this year's free-agent class and was viewed as a potential fit for the Yankees heading into the winter, but it didn't appear that New York had much interest in the four-time All-Star.\n\nHowever, recent events may have changed things for the Bronx Bombers, as Bellinger seems to be asking for $36-37 million annually, a rather steep price for a merely good — not great — 30-year-old player with an injury history.\n\nAs a result, the Yankees have evidently decided to turn their attention to Tucker, who was said to be seeking a $400 million contract at the outset of he offseason, but may have reduced his demands as a result of a slow market.\n\nBut unfortunately, it does not appear that New York is one of the favorites to sign him.\n\nFormer MLB general manager Jim Duquette has revealed that the Toronto Blue Jays, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets are the three teams most connected to Tucker and have all met with the outfielder either in person or via video call.\n\nDuquette wondered if any one of those three ballclubs would \"increase\" their offers, indicating that each of those teams have already made overtures to Tucker.\n\nSo, where do the Yankees fit in all of this? Have they made Tucker an offer? Are they laying in the weeds? Are they really not that interested in the former Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs star?\n\nIt's also entirely possible that Alex Bregman's recent five-year, $175 million contract with the Cubs has rejuvenated Tucker's market and, therefore, his asking price, which may have caused the Yanks to bow out of the process.\n\nNew York has not made a single notable addition this winter. The Yankees are supposedly trying to make a trade for a starting pitcher, but things appear to be moving at a snail's pace on that front.\n\nAs far as signing big-name free agents? Outside of Bellinger, New York has not seemed serious about anyone. It was also linked to Bo Bichette, but it seems hard to imagine the Yanks meeting his asking price, especially considering how bad he is defensively.\n\nIf the Yankees really want Tucker, they better jump in now, because all three of the teams mentioned have deep pockets and are clearly not afraid to spend.",

    "fullText": "It was a fine frenzy in East Rutherford this past season, with the NFL slapping the New York Giants organization, coaches, and players with fines totalling nearly $500,000. That represents roughly 12.5% of the average yearly total across the league ($4 million).\n\nBut it all goes to a good cause:\n\nThe fines collected are donated to the Professional Athletes Foundation to support Legends in need and the NFL Foundation to further support the health, safety and wellness of athletes across all levels, including youth football and the communities that support the game.\n\nThe following data was accumulated through the NFL's operations department, compiled as part of their gameday accountability tracker. It does not include or account for any private appeals and their subsequent results.\n\nHere's a look at all fines levied against the Giants in 2025:\n\nOL James Hudson, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/kneeing): $12,172\n\nLB Brian Burns, unsportsmanlike conduct (taunting): $11,593\n\nGiants organization, violating concussion protocol: $200,000\n\nHC Brian Daboll, conduct detrimental to the league: $100,000\n\nRB Cam Skattebo, conduct detrimental to the league: $15,000\n\nS Tyler Nubin, unnecessary roughness (hip-drop tackle): $10,324\n\nRB Cam Skattebo, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/tripping/kneeing): $6,157\n\nRB Tyrone Tracy Jr., unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $5,731\n\nDT Rakeem Nunez-Roches, unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $23,186\n\nS Dane Belton, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/tripping/kneeing): $7,201\n\nLB Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles, unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $7,292\n\nTE Theo Johnson, unnecessary rough (late hit): $6,488\n\nCB Dru Phillips, unnecessary roughness (hit on defenseless player): $7,292\n\nCB Dru Phillips, unnecessary roughness (pulling player off a pile): $7,293\n\nDB Raheem Layne, unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $5,722\n\nS Tyler Nubin, unsportsmanlike conduct (illegal celebration and vulgar acts): $10,324\n\nCB Rico Payton, unnecessary roughness (late hit): $5,333\n\nCB Rico Payton, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/tripping/kneeing): $5,333\n\nCB Dru Phillips, unnecessary roughness (late hit): $7,293\n\nIndividual franchise/coach/player fines: 14\n\nPlayer fined most times: S Dane Belton (3)\n\nLargest fine: Giants organization ($200,000)\n\nPlayer with highest fine total: DT Rakeem Nunez-Roches ($23,186)\n\nPlayer with largest fine: DT Rakeem Nunez-Roches ($23,186)\n\nCumulative fine total: $453,734\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants racked up nearly $500,000 in fines from NFL in 2025",

    "description": "Miles Guo was convicted of fraud. Now his formerly luxurious lifestyle is being broken down and sold for parts in bankruptcy court.",
    "fullText": "Miles Guo's home these days is a federal jail in Brooklyn. His life was once dizzyingly more fabulous.\n\nThe fraud-convicted one-time billionaire sailed on a gleaming superyacht, wore custom-tailored Brioni suits, and strode through his Gilded Age mansion on a million-dollar cushion of Chinese and Persian carpets.\n\nSince 2022, the cash, homes, luxury cars, and private jets of Guo's suptuous former life have been picked over by prosecutors, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a federal bankruptcy trustee — all trying to claw back money for thousands of creditors and victims in one of the most sprawling fraud cases in recent history.\n\nGuo — aka Ho Wan Kwok and Guo Wengui — lived so lavishly that the liquidation process has taken three years and counting.\n\nHere's a look at some of the priciest assets that, piece by extravagant piece, are being sold off as part of Guo's ongoing 2022 federal bankruptcy case.\n\nFederal prosecutors say Guo starred in Mandarin-language music videos and livestreams that enticed victims from around the world into investing $1.3 billion in his various anti-China and cryptocurrency schemes.\n\nMany of the videos show him in his 15-room Manhattan penthouse, gazing triumphantly at the city from either of two terraces overlooking Central Park.\n\nThe 7,000-square-foot home occupies the entirety of the 18th floor of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue, and is now being sold off as part of the bankruptcy.\n\nBrokers at Compass are asking $12 million — far less than the $67.5 million Guo paid for it in 2015, shortly upon his arrival from China on the heels of a corruption investigation there.\n\nIt was here that Guo was arrested by federal agents in 2023.\n\nConvicted in Manhattan of federal racketeering conspiracy in 2024, Guo's sentencing and a final ruling on forfeiture have been delayed five times, in part due to the complexity of his finances.\n\nGuo's Greenwich, Connecticut, mansion was sold for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate in 2024 for $7.2 million.\n\nThe 21-room, seven-bedroom home, which Guo bought for $4.6 million in 2020, borders the Stanwich Club golf course. Real estate listings feature tennis courts, an in-ground pool, a six-car garage, a billiards room, a gym, and a movie theater. Well-trimmed ivy climbs the stone and wood-shingled exterior.\n\nFederal prosecutors say the home featured bulletproof glass and that Guo employed round-the-clock security in the three years he lived there.\n\nLocated 25 miles from New York City in Mahwah, New Jersey, the historic Crocker-McMillin mansion is the last and most elaborate of the three addresses Guo purchased and then lost control of in the ongoing bankruptcy litigation.\n\nThe home's ceiling murals, elaborately carved railings, and other Gilded Age vestiges can be seen in real estate listings; brokers at Compass are asking $19 million.\n\nAccording to court filings and other online records, Guo bought the 21-bedroom estate for $26 million in 2022.\n\nHe was in the midst of spending another $18 million renovating and furnishing the Jacobean-styled home — built in 1907 by railroad heir George Crocker and modeled after England's Bramshill House — when he was arrested.\n\nGuo's plans included outfitting separate wings for his wife, his son, and his daughter. Federal prosecutors say he'd already purchased $978,000 in carpets, a $62,000, eight-foot-diameter Samsung television, and something his indictment called a $53,000 \"Louis XV-style gilt bronze fireplace log cradle.\"\n\nThe filings don't say if Guo intended to keep the mansion's floor-to-ceiling pipe organ, which likely came in handy during the seven decades the home was a Catholic seminary.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Guo's Cirrus SF50 Vision Jet — a seven-seater he'd purchased in 2019 — was sold back to Cirrus as part of the bankruptcy, for $3.5 million. A second private jet, a Bombardier Global XRS, netted some $12 million.\n\nThe estate has yet to sell Guo's third and last personal aircraft, a four-seat Cirrus SR22 single-engine propeller plane.\n\nGuo's ground-transportation options were also lavish, including a dozen top-end motorcycles and luxury cars, also being litigated for sale in the bankruptcy.\n\nA Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Roadster was seized by the feds from the six-car garage at the Connecticut mansion. And his videos still show him tooling around in his $3.5 million red Ferrari.\n\nThe most expensive of the cars is a $4.4 million custom Bugatti Chiron Super Sport.\n\nGuo's motor yacht, the Lady May, was the first big-ticket item to go on the auction block — in all her shimmering aluminum, white marble, and Macassar ebony glory.\n\nHe spent 41 million euros in fraud proceeds (worth $48 million today) to buy the vessel in 2018. The bankruptcy trustee recovered half that sum — $23 million — three summers ago, selling it, according to bankruptcy filings, to New England auto dealership magnate Herb Chambers.\n\nThe boat boasts five staterooms that can sleep 10 guests, including an owner's cabin with a spacious dressing room and his-and-hers en-suite bathrooms.\n\nGuo's pal and business partner, Steve Bannon, was infamously arrested on board in August 2020.\n\nYacht lovers who missed the 2023 bankruptcy sale have another chance to own it. Now refurbished, renamed \"Excellence V,\" and docked in Fort Lauderdale, the Lady May is listed for sale by yacht brokers Edmiston & Company for $29 million.\n\nGuo's videos, still online, show him stalking the yacht's bleached teak decks as he smokes cigars, raps in Mandarin about his wealth, and aims martial arts kicks at the camera.\n\nIn June, a hodge-podge of furniture, light fixtures, wall hangings, tableware, and knickknacks — 156 items, all from the Manhattan penthouse — were put on the virtual auction block in Connecticut.\n\nThe sale included an ornate mahogany chest of drawers that had been cryptically referred to in Guo's criminal file as \"A Louis XV Style French Ormolu-Mounted Mahogany Commode by Joseph Emmanuel Zweiner.\" \"Veneer damage\" and \"right and left side cracking,\" the auction listing read.\n\nA collection of six small ceramic figurines was listed together as \"Misc. Oriental Items\" and included a \"Damaged & Broken Pig.\" Even a \"Lot of (2) small trash cans\" was up for bidding.\n\nThe bankruptcy file sheds no light on the fate of the racks of hand-tailored Italian suits Guo spoke of while sitting in the library of his penthouse during a 2018 interview with the New York Post.\n\n\"I have 60 custom-made Brioni suits and handmade Louis Vuitton shoes,\" he told the tabloid, which said he added, \"I don't care about things. I'm a Buddhist.\"",

    "title": "I visited Nespresso's NYC flagship, with free coffee and a speakeasy. It showed me how brands want to be our identity.",
    "description": "The nearly 14,000 square-foot store offers free coffee and a place to hang out, but I probably won't be back.",
    "fullText": "At 4:45 pm on Wednesdays, I'm used to hearing my editors discuss the evening's stories. This week, I eavesdropped on a conversation about the similarities between a coffee pod and an oxidized avocado.\n\nI was visiting Nespresso's new flagship location in Manhattan's tourist-heavy Flatiron district, a well-lit, open-air space that feels almost like an Apple store. The Nestlé-owned coffee company opened the nearly 14,000 square-foot store in December, billing its now-largest retail space as \"a destination for modern coffee culture\" in a press release.\n\nPart of the store's big draw is the free coffee, and the self-service station features shiny machines and a wide array of pods. An extremely friendly employee approached me asking if I have a Nespresso — I don't — before explaining how the \"bright, citrusy\" Tanzania coffee pod compares to Velluto, which is like \"the house wine of coffee.\" She gave me instructions for using the machine, displaying the patience and helpful rhyming tips befitting a kindergarten teacher as I somehow fumbled with the two buttons.\n\nAfter having my double shot of Tanzania, which actually was quite bright and citrusy, I wandered over to the smelling station, where you can sniff 12 different brews. As I determined my favorite scent, I kept thinking about something that chef and restaurateur Jeremy Fall, the man behind this summer's viral Hamptons smoothie, told me a few months ago: \"The way people look at drinks is that they sort of say a lot about their identity.\"\n\nThe store also tries to make Nespresso part of customers' identity, with its push toward personalization and finding your signature blend. After helping me make coffee, the employee made sure to tell me that if I buy a glass cup, I can get it engraved with any personal message for free.\n\n\"If it's free, it's for me!\" she told me. The store emphasizes its free offerings, including a barista class and complimentary coffee, yet I couldn't shake my awareness that the whole point is to make me buy stuff. The walls are lined with mugs, nanofoamers, barista recipe makers, flavored syrups, Nespresso machines, pod holders, and even bag charms à la Labubu.\n\nYet there is also the genuine possibility of simply hanging out. Two employees let me know that the store's secret, hidden coffee speakeasy opened at 5 pm, tucked behind a painting on the lower level.\n\nI stepped inside around 5:15 pm, and a line had formed by 5:20 pm. The mocktail bar offered three drinks, and I went with \"The Hidden Fizz\" after the bartender said it was the most refreshing. The $15 drink was the only item I paid for during my visit.\n\nDespite the trappings of a speakeasy, the space didn't feel private, especially since multiple employees told me to visit. In the dim lighting and over an unidentifiable jazz song, people took pictures or chatted quietly.\n\nThough I generally avoid fruit-coffee combos, I liked the drink more than expected. I forced my coworkers, Henry and Ana, to meet me at the store and try it, too. Henry agreed that it was OK if a little too sweet, and didn't realize it had any coffee; Ana was \"literally obsessed.\"\n\nThere's also a lounge downstairs, with self-service coffee, couches, a chessboard, and a record player. When I walked in, an employee, dressed in the store's characteristic beige, stood at a counter reading \"How to Taste Coffee.\" Other books dotted the space, many of them focused on nature despite our being underground in New York City: multiple editions of \"Great Escapes,\" a photography collection featuring outdoor athletes, and a selection of works by the chronically outside painter Monet.\n\nMuch like Starbucks, it seems that the Nespresso flagship wants to be a third space, an informal social place beyond home or work. And to an extent, it accomplishes the goal — two guys at the chess table sat discussing H-1B visas, while two women huddled on a couch without even holding coffee cups.\n\nI don't see myself coming back, mainly because I'd prefer to spend my time in a smaller, local New York City café, but partly because of the not-so-subtle push to make me identify with, and identify myself by, the brand. Yet for those who don't mind that and can fight the impulse to buy Nespresso products, the store can serve as a rare spot to get a free coffee and sit on a plush sofa.",

    "fullText": "Hell fucking YES they dropped 10 on New York!\n\nEnjoy. After the Rangers scored their first goal…\n\n…The Boston Bruins put belt to ass for 60 straight minutes. 10-2 Bruins Win!\n\nYour TOI Leader was Charlie McAvoy, who had 21:26 logged last night.\n\nThe Bruins got to see what the New York Rangers are without their vaunted goaltender Igor Sheshterkin, and as it turns out, the New York Rangers suck out loud. The Bruins were allowed gorgeous opportunities to score all night, and with Sheshterkin out, the Rangers defense was effectively bullied all night, forcing a goalie change and a historic night in Boston.\n\nKhusnutdinov and Pavel Zacha had hat tricks tonight; as I’m sure you’ve read this is the first time since 1964 since the Bruins have ever had two players record double hatties on home ice.\n\nIn the middle of all this it can be easy to lose the guys who didn’t get hat tricks, but this was a phenomenal night for Fraser Minten, who got two goals, and Charlie McAvoy, who got his 2nd of the year. Good for both of them!\n\nDavid Pastrnak had the first 6 point game in almost 50 years for the Boston Bruins, joining Ken Hodge and Bobby Orr as the only players in team history to do such a thing. Just another moment on the pile for the legend. What a special player.\n\nI’m sure this game will produce some all-timer whining from JT Miller.\n\nJeremy Swayman, now properly rested and to be clear, was not doing nothing all game, had a pretty good finish; .931 SV% on 29 shots is nothing to sneeze at. Now, let’s make absolutely sure Korpi starts today. Okay?\n\nThe last time the Bruins scored 10 in a game was back in 1988, when they absolutely pasted the Blackhawks in a 10-3 contest. That game featured Cam Neely with a 7 point night, Craig Janney with a 3 assist night, Steve Kasper with two goals, and 5 other Bruins scoring in that contest. Tidy bit of work by the B’s tonight. Tidy bit indeed.\n\nThe Bruins continue things on today against the Pens! That game is at 5pm EST.",

    "fullText": "Friday's usual \"Ask The Maven\" was on holiday but  \"ATM\" is running today. This week's question comes from City Island, New York. Jack Gumpert asks:\n\nHOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HOW THE TV MEDIA IS HANDLING THE RANGERS SITUATION?\n\nThe Maven replies: You have to start with the fact that whether the Blueshirts win or lose, it's all there for the public to see on the screen, in person as well as all the replays available.\n\nThere can be no cheating the viewing public.\n\nMSG Networks' analyst styles vary. Sam Rosen and Joe Micheletti, for example, were more –  shall I say – temperate in their handling of a non-playoff team. They were professional and rational which were fair enough and the fans adored them.\n\nThe very able replacements, Kenny Albert and Dave Maloney, have brought their pungent-no-kidding-around radio styles superbly to television and – I'm certain – fans find it most refreshing.\n\nEmotional – in a fan kind of way – Maloney reacts more forcefully than Micheletti while Albert\n\ncontinues to be the best play-by-play man for which a Rangers fan can root. MSG Networks employs a variety of other analyst types and some penetraiting ones.\n\nI was intrigued with a post-game schmooze the other night between the very insightful John Gianonne and Steve Valiquette. It was very revealing in terms of Vally's comments about some of the Rangers. Take a look:\n\n\"Now is the time of year where you start sitting people,\" Valiquette asserted. \"You have to get everybody's attention. You start with Lafreniere; he's pacing for 16 goals. Terrible giveaway (late vs. Buffalo) again; getting less than 15 minutes of ice time right now. You have to get more from him.\n\n\"You need to get more from your top six and I think that it sends a message to everybody that they can be next. One of the biggest challenges NHL teams have is that guys make a lot of money and you can't shame or blame a millionaire. But you can embarrass them by taking away their ice time. That's the only thing you can control.\n\nRemembering Glenn Hall Against The Rangers I have to admit that The Maven has taken the passing of Hall of Fame goalie Glenn Hall hard. Tearful hard.\n\n\"You can control the narrative in your room if you do that. You can go there. Sometimes during a game, you miss a shift. Panarin not backchecking on the empty net goal should cost  PP time in the next game.\n\n\"You have a meeting with him (and say) 'Look, you didn't skate at the end of the game on the PP.'\"\n\nToday, we'll see who comes through and who doesn't and I expect that the MSG Networks' pros will tell us what we need to know!\n\nOh, yeah, by the way, they need two points!",

    "fullText": "Following the publication of a report in The New York Times on Friday night revealing that the Washington National Opera will be leaving the Kennedy Center, members of the Trump administration immediately began scrambling to reframe the news as not only a positive, but their idea.\n\nKennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi, who has been hard at work lashing out at artists for canceling scheduled performances at the once-revered venue, posted a statement to X claiming that the center’s relationship with the opera group has “presented ongoing financial challenges for well over a decade” that “long predate the current leadership.”\n\n“Given the longstanding financial strain, it has become necessary for us to part ways to protect the best interests of the Center,” Daravi wrote.\n\nThe statement was then amplified by the venue’s Donald Trump-appointed executive director Richard Grenell, who elaborated on the difficulties surrounding exclusivity agreements.\n\n“Having an exclusive relationship has been extremely expensive and limiting in choice and variety,” Grenell wrote on X. “We approached the Opera leadership last year with this idea and they began to be open to it.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, he wrote, “The exclusive Opera contract cost the Trump Kennedy Center $64 million over the last 10 years—with their expenses being double their revenues.”\n\n“We were very pleased that the current Opera leadership was so willing to end their exclusivity,” he noted.\n\nThe New York Times report states that the decision to sever ties was made by the Washington National Opera, with the board of trustees approving a resolution on Friday that will enable the group to terminate its agreement with the venue.\n\n“Today, the Washington National Opera announced its decision to seek an amicable early termination of its affiliation agreement with the Kennedy Center and resume operations as a fully independent nonprofit entity,” a statement provided to The New York Times said.\n\nOpera officials told the paper that new venues in Washington D.C. have been lined up but that no leases have been signed. They declined to name specific venues.\n\nWith the passing of the resolution, the WNO will now seek to move its performances out of the center’s opera house and reduce the number of performances staged there.\n\nThe decision marks the end of a partnership between the Kennedy Center and the WNO that dates back to 1971.\n\nWhile the WNO did not mention the Kennedy Center’s MAGA rebrand as the reason for its departure, they have noted disagreements with new requirements that have been made under the cultural center’s new management.\n\nSeveral well-known performers have canceled planned events since President Donald Trump’s takeover of the center, which saw him fire the board in order to populate it with his allies and install himself as chair.\n\nTrump further ignited tensions when he attempted to rebrand the center to bear his name, ignoring the fact that any formal change requires congressional action. A lawsuit was filed shortly after, challenging the rebrand.\n\nIn response to Trump’s actions, several artists have canceled planned appearances at the performing arts venue, including comedian Issa Rae, folk act Rhiannon Giddens, musician Kristy Lee, trumpeter Wayne Tucker, and Grammy-winning bluegrass performer Béla Fleck.\n\nOn Thursday, singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos canceled her Feb. 7 performance at the Kennedy Center, citing her Mexican heritage and the Trump administration’s immigration policies as the reasons behind her decision.\n\n“As an artist, I treasure the freedom to create and share my music, and for many years I have used this privilege to uplift the stories of immigrants in this country,” the Grammy-nominated musician wrote on Thursday. “Unfortunately, I do not feel that the current climate at this beloved venue represents a welcoming space for myself, my band, or our audience.”",

    "description": "Former New York Times writer Harvey Araton's novel reveals a raucous life of a youth athlete, and lessons we can all learn from it.",
    "fullText": "It’s a statement but also a question we can ask ourselves as sports parents.\n\nIt’s driven into our kids very early, often by us.\n\nOr is it to just enjoy the experience?\n\n“Dad, according to Mom, asked the parents in our group not to worry about how good we were, or weren’t,” writes author Harvey Araton, through the eyes of a kid named “Z,” in a new middle-grade novel.\n\nZ’s dad was the coach of the boy’s first soccer team. It’s a neighborhood collection of grade school buddies. Dad didn’t just roll out the ball, though. He orchestrated drills that mimicked game situations that gave everyone a shot at the action.\n\n“You scrimmage too much, and the same kids, the stronger players, will dominate the ball, and then how do the other kids get better?” Z overhears his dad telling his mom early in the book.\n\nEveryone notices, in fiction and reality, when others don’t have this growth mentality.\n\nZ and his teammates hear opposing parents scream for blood, or at least a foul, when his team, once a doormat, incrementally starts to get better and begins to dominate.\n\nThe kids of manic youth sports parents, one of whom Araton admits to once being himself, is whom he wants to reach. The veteran sportswriter, most recently with The New York Times for 25 years, covered the Danny Almonte age scandal at the 2001 Little League World Series, and the ensuing escalation of Little League World Series coverage into American living rooms.\n\nHe has pondered or written about (or both) kids choosing between club and high school soccer and early sports specialization.\n\nHe also played the role of sports dad to two now-grown sons (36 and 32).\n\n“Kids learn playing sports,” Araton tells USA TODAY Sports. “I think there's a joy in that. I just feel, especially at these early years, it's becoming infected with this ambition that there could be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and I think too many parents become obsessed with turning their children into potential cash machines.”\n\nAraton launched the book last week with a signing at his local bookstore in Montclair, New Jersey. He made sure to also include a panel discussion about youth sports. He spoke with us about how his novel imitates the raucous life America lives within it, and the lessons he has gleaned from it.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nAraton is from Staten Island, which he describes as New York City’s last developed borough. It still has large swaths of parks and fields, where his story is set.\n\nHe had grown up on the basketball courts near his public housing development. The free play felt natural as it took him to the local Jewish community center and high school. He eventually played at a health club in Brooklyn as an adult and even worked in Madison Square Garden, where he covered the Knicks, the team he had idolized as a kid.\n\nHis competitive juices carried him into fatherhood when his older son, Alex, was in first grade and had the option of going out for a travel team. It’s a decision many of us have faced.\n\n“I remember asking him if he wanted to try out,” Araton says. “And he was kind of a naturally cautious kid and said, ‘Not really,’ and I remember being disappointed, a little deflated. Maybe I already was thinking, ‘If he doesn't go into this next level, he'll fall behind and never catch up, (and) there will go any chance of playing in high school.’ I mean, I could look at my kids, look at their size even at that age and know that they weren't likely to be D1 college athletes.\n\n“But I remember being disappointed and over the next couple of weeks, I came up with five or six different ways to pose the same question. Well, Nick's trying out, you sure you don't want (to)? And he kept saying no. And then the last time that I asked, he said, ‘No, dad.’ And then he looked at me and said, ‘But if I don't play travel, can I still play in the town league?’\n\n“And I remember feeling this sensation of shame because I realized in that moment that I was projecting my own ambitions and my own sports values onto this 6-year-old kid. And all he wanted to do at that point in his life was just run around and play with a bunch of kids he knew and maybe take one or two things out of any game and feel good about himself and look forward to the snacks.”\n\nThe book’s central character, who tells the story in the first person, is a combination of Araton’s two sons. Charly, Alex’s younger brother, was 4-foot-11 when he entered high school but played on the basketball team for four years.\n\nZ is left-footed with really good field vision like Alex and he’s small and feisty like Charly was. It doesn’t seem to bother Z when his young team is losing because he knows he will celebrate the things they all did well, or at least enjoyed, at Big Mitch’s restaurant afterward.\n\nBig Mitch is the father of his friend and teammate, Lloyd.\n\n“You only let in, like, seven or eight goals on an undefeated travel team,” he tells Lloyd, the team’s goalie, in the book. “Do you think a kid who was out of shape could do that?”\n\nZ becomes less comfortable when sports becomes more and more competitive. His father has a horrific accident and the team eventually gets a coach from England, who adopts a similar skills-first mindset with the kids. Kevin, the coach, who has also had a traumatic experience with his father, takes Z under his wing.\n\nAs the boys and girls on the team continue to rise in competition level, and travel further and further away from Staten Island, Z gets a much more transactional coach.\n\nHe feels himself immersed in a world over which he has less and less control, similar to the experiences Araton observed and felt as a soccer dad.\n\n“The reason why I chose soccer is because I probably was most closely involved with that, whether it was as coaching them in the early grades or just being at the games and kind of like, living for it a little bit,” he says. “I understand why parents are so heavily involved. After a week of work you really look forward to the experience of the games. It's like an adrenaline rush but also I think, it created a whole social network with the parents of their teammates and friends and everything. So I get the temptation, and the seductiveness, of it all, but (it) all got completely out of control, as well.”\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nWhile Araton was growing up on Staten Island, the borough’s Mid-Island Little League won it all in Williamsport. Years later, as a sportswriter, Araton caught up with Danny Yaccarino, who came within one strike of a perfect game during that 1964 Little League World Series against Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nHe wrote a column, (‘After Perfection at the Age of 12, What's Next?’) detailing how Yaccarino became a very good high school pitcher and reached the Baltimore Orioles organization and yet, he was always haunted by the feeling of coming so close to near-perfection as a Little Leaguer and not getting it.\n\n“Not only did he get a lot of bench jockeying and all that stuff throughout his career, but he also put incredible pressure on himself,” Araton says. “He turned out to be a minor league pitcher and he never went very far. But he told me that he finished his career feeling like an abject failure.”\n\nZ feels an emptiness, too, at the climax of the book. It's a feeling that can be induced by us.\n\n\"Parents, being vulnerable, and easily manipulated into spending vast sums of money, (wind) up treating their children like they are speculating on a stock, an investment,\" Araton says. \"They're not stocks that will pay off at 8 or 9 or 10 years; they're developing human beings.\"\n\n“Z, we’re running behind,” his mother yells upstairs, trying to get him moving for his U-13 fall season-opening game. She’s now the team’s driven parent-manager.\n\n“The construction of this story is really about Z coming to an understanding of what role sports should play in his life,” Araton says. “And when I say that, I mean, at that particular time, kids are always subject to change. He's at a point in his life where he's experienced family trauma, and, when he looks around, he doesn't see the friends who he loves, the kids that he grew up playing with. He sees a lot of strange kids. And that's not what he wants. More than playing at an elite level, he wants to play with kids who know him, who know what he's gone through.\n\n“He realizes that he still loves the game, but will only play it under his terms.”\n\nIsn’t that what we all want? What about our kids, too?\n\n“You could offer them the higher-level stuff,” Araton says, “but if it's being forced upon them, and if you're calling up to their bedroom every time there's practice, then it's clear that they don't really want to do it.\n\n“I wouldn't deny an exceptional child that kind of pathway any more than you would, say, if you had a child who (was) a mathematical genius or a classical violinist, you would want them to have the best teachers to best capitalize on their special talent. But the temptation is so great because sports is the most visible thing in the community. …\n\n\"It'll become pretty obvious to a parent if they have someone special. But this whole notion that they can create one by spending significant sums of money, I think it's really overstated.”\n\nAraton points to another interview he did, with Yael Averbuch, the general manager of the New Jersey/New York Gotham FC of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). She played for an exclusive club team in high school, won two national championships playing for the University of North Carolina and was drafted professionally.\n\nHer mother said she never had to yell upstairs for practice. Yael was the one yelling to them.\n\nAraton’s sons, like Z, had to figure out where sports fit into their lives. It worked out for them, too.\n\nAlex, who played high school soccer, is a special education teacher and Charly, the high school basketball player (who has grown to about 5-foot-9 today), works in marketing strategies for a fashion brand. He still plays in men’s leagues.\n\nAraton says those middle-grade age groups – 8 to 12, give or take – are the ages where people know the least amount about who their children are as athletes.\n\n“Don’t be disappointed if at the age of 8, they are not willing to do all this stuff and make all that sacrifice,” he says. “They might be ready when they're 11. Kids do things on their own time schedules. So just accept who they are and let them experience sports in the way they want to. They’ll enjoy it more and get more out of it.\n\n“If they're not playing for the idea of feeling good about themselves, about learning to be a coachable kid, and be a good teammate, to play with kids from all different backgrounds and develop their skills at the fundamental level at the age of 7, 8, 9, 10,” Araton says, “then they're playing for the wrong reasons.\n\n“Each shall develop at their own rate. I just think that parents have to chill and let the kids experience it for themselves.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "fullText": "New York Giants fans have experienced growing frustration over the past decade as the once-successful organization has regressed into one of the league's worst. That frustration has led to some protests, including various banners demanding change being flown over MetLife Stadium.\n\nOther fans have taken their anger directly to the desk of Giants co-owner John Mara, writing him letters of disgust -- something he, like his late father, will often read and respond to, personally.\n\nThat frustration continued to grow in 2025, but with one caveat: In September, Mara revealed he had been diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"I have recently been diagnosed with cancer and have been following the treatment plan recommended by an outstanding team of doctors,\" Mara said in a statement. \"I'm feeling strong and optimistic, and I'm committed to seeing this through to a positive outcome.\n\n\"I plan to remain active with the team throughout my treatment, and I'm fortunate to be surrounded by incredible support -- personally, professionally, and medically. I ask that you respect my privacy and my family’s privacy at this time.\"\n\nAs he battled cancer, Mara was less visible around the team. And although fans remained frustrated as the Giants stumbled to just four wins, they did take some time out to show love.\n\nAlmost went to Vietnam for this pic.twitter.com/qig0c7rUz2\n\n— Giants Nation Show (@GiantsNationPod) November 2, 2025\n\nOn Friday, with the Giants firmly entrenched in offseason mode, the expressions of love, support, and prayer continued.\n\nNew York Revival, along with many other Giants fans and content creators, compiled a video message for Mara, offering their support and well wishes as he battles cancer — an evil that has impacted all of us at some point or another, in some form or fashion.\n\nA message to John Mara \nfrom the Giants Family 🙏 @Giants | #NYGiants pic.twitter.com/EvnvjkH9cX\n\n— New York Revival (@NewYorkRevival) January 9, 2026\n\nWe at Giants Wire echo that love and those prayers.

    "title": "We run our bakery out of shipping containers. It was an unexpectedly cost-effective solution to scaling our business.",
    "description": "Chrissy Traore and her husband Ben started a bakery in New York. When they needed more space, they turned to shipping containers as the solution.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chrissy Traore, 41, who opened See & Be Kitchen with her husband Ben Salif Traore in Cairo, New York, about 40 miles from Albany, New York. When their business expanded quickly, they began running parts of it out of shipping containers on their property. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBen and I met while I was a chef and he was a baker. We worked at the same restaurant — they had a bakery and a restaurant right next door, and I was their pizza chef and he was their head baker. I had to mix my pizza dough in his mixer and that's kind of how we met.\n\nBefore, I worked on Madison Avenue in marketing and brand strategy, and in 2008, the economy crashed and my job crashed too. When that happened, I moved into food. I took a job on an ice cream truck and just fell in love with food work.\n\nI was in the food industry in various ways in New York City from about 2008 until 2017.\n\nWhile working in the industry, I was unhappy with the way that they treated employees. I was in management at the time, so I could see the full round numbers.\n\nI thought, \"There has to be a better way, but it's not my job to change this business owner or this business.\"\n\nBen and I talked a lot about it, and we were going upstate frequently — I was working at a place upstate as their first chef.\n\nI said, \"We should really move upstate.\" It's more our speed. We like the outdoors. We like having space. The quality of life is better. We love farming and being close to what's happening on the ground, literally. In 2017 we said, let's get out of the city.\n\nWe didn't have a ton of money, and we had to be scrappy and thoughtful about how we deployed the resources that we had saved. We wanted a place where we could live and work, so we wanted property and land — that was important to us.\n\nWe found a property in Cairo, New York, and it had been a bar and a hotel, so it was already grandfathered in on DOH, and had some structures there. We have 11 acres, and the house was practically falling apart, so we could afford it. We paid $189,900, and that was it. We went all in.\n\nWe knew we wanted to open our own place and we were trying to discover what that was. We knew it would involve Ben's bread and my cooking.\n\nWe started renovating the property and doing farmers markets, and that's how we got to know the community that we were in.\n\nWe came in quietly, like, \"Let's see what's already here and get to know people before we just bash them over the head with what we do.\" Let's see what they want, because ultimately we're entering a community that's not necessarily ours yet.\n\nWe were moving from Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn, and part of the reason we moved out was we saw that happening. People were moving in and they would say, \"We need to fix this. This is broken.\" And I'm like, \"What is broken? This is a wonderful community. Please stop.\"\n\nSometime in 2018, we turned into See & Be. Then, from there, we really got some traction at farmers markets.\n\nWe were doing porch pickups — people could pick up their orders at a local massage therapist's house — so we had started operating, but we didn't have a physical space yet.\n\nWe were still building out the cafe in the very small already existing structure on our property. We had one oven, with one proofer, a little cooktop that I would do the sandwiches on, and a coffee station with this beautiful wooden bar that people could sit at. And we opened that in February of 2019. Ben baked everything; I ran the front of house.\n\nWe had a five-year plan and it went into overdrive. Soon, we needed more space, and I could not get a building up fast enough. With traditional buildings, we looked at it and we thought it was going to take a year and a half to two years. We couldn't do that. We needed space like tomorrow.\n\nI had worked for a company while in Brooklyn that was actually my first shipping container job. That was at the DeKalb Market, and it was all built out of shipping containers.\n\nI realized there was no way to get a building through the planning board and everything quickly enough — but I could get a shipping container.\n\nI looked at Ben and I said, \"The fastest way we can do this is to get a shipping container.\" And he said, \"Are you kidding?\" I said, \"No.\"\n\nWe really bootstrapped our business from day one. We had a $10,000 investment in building out the space over time. We costed it out, and we could afford it with what we had already made in the business.\n\nWe got our approval and I was so excited. I posted it on our Facebook page and we got over 4,000 interactions. We couldn't not open.\n\nOur first shipping container was a regular shipping container — a 40' by 20' high cube. We placed it on wooden rail ties, which was not great — those degraded over the years, especially with heavy usage.\n\nWe thought of ourselves as scrappy: \"Well, we did the cafe, we can do this ourselves. So why would I pay to have a spray foam? We'll do that ourselves.\" That was terrible idea.\n\nI think we bought every spray foam insulation canister in a 200-mile radius of here from Home Depot and Lowe's. We didn't know what we were doing. We were just trying to figure it out. The walls were uneven and it worked, but it wasn't a great solution.\n\nThen we pushed out of that shipping container and needed even more space. At that point, we needed more cold storage. I started doing more research into shipping containers and came across decommissioned reefers.\n\nThey're pre-insulated and have steel walls. And unlike a regular shipping container that has a wood floor, this has a steel flat floor. So it's already food-ready.\n\nWe bought the first container for $6,000 painted and delivered. And then we spent another couple thousand dollars in spray foam. God only knows how much the labor was, because we did it ourselves and that took forever.\n\nWe have running water and electric in the containers, but most of the mixing happens in our original building.\n\nThat following year, as our business grew and began to quickly scale, we kept outgrowing our space and needing more and more room. Once we saw how quickly we could get a shipping container in place — about a month — it was easy to go, \"OK, well, gee, trucks can double my space in a month.\"\n\nThe second container was much faster and easier to set up. I bought that directly through a broker at the port. We paid $8,500 for that one.\n\nWhen we installed the second container, we leveled the ground, put in concrete pillars, and the cranes came in and moved the original container and did that whole process. Then, with the third container, it was very easy to attach it because the ground was already graded and leveled.\n\nIt cost about $7,500 to $15,000 per container at the end of the day, because we had to get the crane to get them moved, and we had to get them welded together.\n\nIt's always funny when someone comes up to the building for the first time, and they're just like, \"What is this? Where is the bakery?\" And then they knock on a shipping container door.\n\nPeople are always shook to see that it's a real production. They think we're winging this or pretending because there's these shipping containers. But when you walk in, you forget you're in a shipping container.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A judge’s ruling that a Trump administration prosecutor in upstate New York was serving unlawfully has spilled into another case — with the same judge saying he can’t obtain tax return information in a criminal investigation because he lacks authority.\n\nThe ruling Thursday against prosecutor John Sarcone from U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield came the same day the judge disqualified Sarcone from overseeing investigations into Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. In that case, Schofield ruled that Sarcone was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York and that any “of his past or future acts taken in that capacity are void or voidable.”\n\nSarcone is among the prosecutors around the country found by federal judges to lack authority after the Republican administration used unusual maneuvers to place them or keep them in their posts without U.S. Senate confirmation.\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, said Schofield's ruling was consistent with previous decisions.\n\n“It does seem like more and more courts are coming around to this view,” he said.\n\nIn a separate ruling Thursday, Schofield denied Sarcone's application for a court order directing the IRS to disclose tax return information for a limited liability company as part of a criminal investigation. The application remains sealed and it's not clear who filed the tax returns sought in the Oct. 2 request.\n\nApplications for that tax information can only be made by officials holding specific positions, such as U.S. attorneys. The Manhattan judge said Sarcone lacked authority to authorize the application because he was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney — mirroring her reasoning in the case involving James.\n\nAn email seeking comment was sent to the northern district.\n\nCourts in New Jersey, Nevada and California have held that similarly installed acting U.S. attorneys lacked lawful authority. Trump’s former personal attorney, Alina Habba,resigned as the top federal prosecutor for New Jersey in December after an appeals court said she had been serving unlawfully.",

    "title": "Why Trump is suing The New York Times — and giving them 2-hour interviews",
    "description": "The president uses digital media to get his message across — but he really loves old media like newspapers and cable TV.",
    "fullText": "Last fall, Donald Trump filed a $15 billion defamation suit against The New York Times. That suit is still ongoing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sat down with Times reporters at the White House for a 2-hour interview, where he expounded on his worldview, conducted an off-the-record conversation with the president of Colombia, and showed off new plans to renovate the West Wing.\n\nIf that surprises you, it shouldn't. Trump, and the rest of his administration, love to complain about the Times and other big, mainstream media outfits. They also love talking to them.\n\nEarlier this week, for instance, key Trump advisor Stephen Miller appeared on CNN for a much-discussed interview with Jake Tapper, where he laid out a bellicose view of America's role in the world.\n\nA few days before that, Trump talked to The Wall Street Journal — another publication he's currently suing — for a story about his health and fitness.\n\nAnd last month Vanity Fair published a lengthy profile of Susie Wiles, Trump's chief of staff, which involved multiple interviews with Wiles and portraits of her and other Trump officials, including Miller, Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nTrump has made mainstream media a target since he started running for president in 2015, calling reports he doesn't like \"fake news,\" and labeling journalists \"enemies of the people.\" He's called for a change in US libel law, so he can more easily punish journalists, and he often insists that TV networks that irk him should have their broadcast licenses revoked.\n\nAnd his rhetoric and actions have ramped up in his second term, where he has banned the Associated Press from events in the Oval Office, stocked the White House briefing room with Trump-friendly outlets, and pushed out all mainstream reporters from the Pentagon.\n\nAll of that should worry anyone who cares about press freedom — or in less lofty terms, the ability of the press to accurately tell you what's happening in the federal government.\n\nThe flip of that is quite simple: Trump is a man who grew up in a world dominated by traditional media — newspapers and television — and he still cares very much about what traditional media says about him, no matter what he says. That's why he delights in constant press appearances in the White House, aboard Air Force One, and anywhere else reporters have cameras, microphones, and notepads.\n\nI often think of an AP photo from last spring, shortly after he'd announced his initial, chaotic tariff plan, that shows him perusing the New York Post's coverage of that plan in the back of his limousine. We focus a lot of attention on Trump's ability to use Twitter, YouTube, podcasts, and other digital media to shape public perception. But he's very much an old media guy — print, broadcast, cable.\n\nAnd as long as those things still exist, Trump will want to be in them and flattered by their coverage. Which explains why he can sue them and invite them into his office at the same time.",

    "title": "I run alcohol-free nightlife events in NYC. Most of my guests aren't sober — they just don't want to drink.",
    "description": "Sam Bail, the founder of Bright Nights Social, told Business Insider that demand is booming for her alcohol-free nightlife events in New York.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Bail, a data engineer and the founder of the alcohol-free pop-up event company, Bright Nights Social. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThree years ago, I had the idea to open an alcohol-free bar in New York City.\n\nI don't drink, but I still wanted nightlife — dancing, music, meeting new people, getting out of the house on a Friday or Saturday night. What I didn't want was another alcohol-free space that was centered on wellness, meditation, or yoga. I wanted something that still felt like real nightlife, just without booze being the main event.\n\nInstead of signing a lease, I started testing the idea by hosting pop-up events. I'd take over coffee shops or other venues at night and turn them into alcohol-free bars for the evening.\n\nWhat started as an experiment quickly took on a life of its own.\n\nOver the past three years, I've collaborated with tons of venues, experimented with a variety of new formats, and thousands of people have come through our doors. That's been the most surprising part of all of this: the demand.\n\nWhat's even more interesting? Most of the people who attend my events aren't even sober.\n\nWhen people hear \"alcohol-free event,\" they often assume the crowd is made up entirely of sober or sober-curious people. That hasn't been my experience at all. Based on conversations with guests, I estimate that at least 75% of the people who attend my events don't identify as sober or even sober-curious.\n\nThey're mostly in their mid-20s to early 30s — older Gen Z and very young millennials. Gender splits depend on the event, but many of my parties are close to 50-50 men and women. What they have in common is that they want to go out, socialize, and have fun without making drinking the center of their entire social life.\n\nI'm 40, so I'm an elder millennial who's already done the heavy partying phase and is over it. But many of the people who come to Bright Nights Social are younger than me and feel the same way. They'll tell me things like, \"I still drink sometimes, I just don't want to do it every time I go out,\" or \"Alcohol makes me feel terrible the next day.\"\n\nThey're not abstaining out of moral opposition to alcohol or because of addiction. They're opting out because they don't like the cost, the hangovers, or the way drinking dominates social life in cities like New York.\n\nWhat I see aligns with a broader shift happening right now, especially among younger people. There's a growing focus on experiences rather than just going to a bar and spending money on drinks. In New York City, you can see it everywhere: pottery classes, cooking classes, rug tufting, late-night library events, group reading clubs.\n\nSome of my favorites have been hosting cooking classes and our crafting events, like rug-making. Coming up this month, we have a tea bar, a bagel-making (and eating!) class, and a full-on dance party, complete with DJs and a full non-alcoholic bar, to close out Dry January.\n\nPeople want to do something. They want to make memories. They just don't want to wake up feeling awful the next day.\n\nCost is also a big factor. When cocktails are $15 or $20 each, it doesn't take long for a casual night out to become extremely expensive. A lot of people tell me they'd rather spend their money on an experience than on alcohol that doesn't even make them feel good.\n\nThat doesn't mean Gen Z isn't drinking at all. In fact, some recent data suggests younger people are actually drinking more now than they were a year or two ago. I think part of that is a post-pandemic catch-up effect — many Gen Zers reached legal drinking age during lockdowns and simply didn't have the chance to go out.\n\nWhat I see on the ground is moderation. People might have one drink at dinner and then switch to a nonalcoholic beer. Or they'll alternate between alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks throughout the night — what some people call \"zebra striping.\" They're being much more intentional about how and when they drink.\n\nAnother huge shift I'm seeing is the role of legal THC. I don't serve THC products at my events, but I don't stop anyone from having one before they come, and I hear about them constantly from guests and friends who work at nonalcoholic bottle shops. THC drinks are some of the best-selling products in those stores.\n\nPeople understand what THC does. They say it helps with social anxiety, takes the edge off, and feels more manageable than alcohol when used in moderation. Compared to that, there's still skepticism around functional or adaptogenic drinks — things with nootropics, ashwagandha, or functional mushrooms. Many people aren't convinced that those drinks actually do anything beyond being a placebo.\n\nThat said, I think we're still early. As people learn what works for their own bodies — whether that's L-theanine, lion's mane, or something else — those functional beverages may gain more traction.\n\nAt the same time, I'm also seeing conversations online about people pulling back from THC after overdoing it, so I think we'll see a similar trend as people try to find nightlife events that best suit their needs.\n\nI don't think most people want to be completely sober forever, but they are actively experimenting with what moderation looks like.\n\nThe biggest misconception about alcohol-free nightlife is that it's boring or restrictive. What I've learned is that people don't want to be told what not to do — they just want more options.\n\nBright Nights Social isn't about sobriety as an identity. It's about creating a space where alcohol isn't the default. You can still dance, flirt, meet strangers, and stay out late. The only difference is that you're not expected to drink to participate.\n\nThe fact that so many non-sober people show up tells me this isn't a niche idea anymore. Alcohol-free nightlife isn't just for people who've quit drinking entirely. It's for anyone who wants to go out — and wake up the next day feeling like themselves.\n\nDo you host or attend alternative nightlife events? Contact this reporter at ktl@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Nearly 16,000 nurses set to join union-led strike Monday to demand large hospitals across NYC ‘put patients over profit’",
    "fullText": "Nearly 16,000 nurses in New York City are set to strike on Monday amid a battle over pay during contract negotiations.\n\nThe action, due to take place across five large hospitals, is being organized by the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA), which is demanding the hospitals put patients over profit.\n\nThe hospitals insist they continue to bargain in good faith, and have accused the union of trying to disrupt patient care.\n\nCEO compensation at three hospitals – Montefiore, Mount Sinai, and New York Presbyterian – is nearly 12,000 times more than that of the average nurse, according to the union.\n\nNancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, who has worked at Maimonides medical center in Brooklyn for over 30 years, told the Guardian that the hospitals are pushing to scale back safe staffing ratios, refusing to guarantee healthcare benefit coverage for nurses, and declining to address workplace safety issues.\n\nThree of the major hospitals involved in contract negotiations have $1.6bn cash or cash equivalent on hand, according to the union, which said they have already started hiring travel nurses to replace those striking in preparation for a strike.\n\n“What we are asking them is to take those millions and invest it into the community so we could continue to work to care for our patients, invest it into staffing, invest those millions into our medical coverage so we could come to work,” said Hagans. “We’re not taking this lightly. We’re not asking to strike. Management is the one who’s telling us that we need to strike. They are the ones putting us on the picket line.”\n\nShe cited safety issues that stem from a drastic increase of assaults on healthcare workers since the Covid-19 pandemic, and an active shooter incident at Mount Sinai last November, where three nurses were reportedly disciplined for speaking out afterwards.\n\n“The large, wealthy hospitals are much better off financially than they were three years ago, but yet they’re asking for takeaways,” claimed Hagans. “They told us to choose between our wages or keeping our healthcare and safe staffing, because we cannot have it all. The safety of a patient should never be a bargaining chip. Nurses will not cut corners on patients and their safety. Nurses are just demanding that New York City private hospitals put patients over profit.”\n\nNurses represented by NYSNA issued 10-day strike notices on 2 January at a string of New York hospitals. On Tuesday, seven of the smaller hospitals moved forward in contract negotiations, with the union rescinding their strike notice.\n\nAbout 1,000 nurses at three Northwell hospitals in Long Island have also issued strike notices.\n\n“Our nurses have been at the bargaining table since September 2025 with little to no movement,” said Simone Way, a member of the NYSNA executive committee, and a nurse at Mount Sinai Morningside hospital. “Even though we started this process in September, there have been committees in the hospital having these same discussions on staffing since January 2025, so it’s no surprise to our management the things nurses feel we need.”\n\nWay also criticized hospital management’s efforts to blame the strike on nurses, claiming they are putting patients at risk and asking for too much. “They do have the money, but they don’t appear to be willing to invest that money in their nurses or into the ability for us to provide the best care humanly possible to our patients,” she said.\n\nMount Sinai denied retaliation claims against nurses following November’s active-shooter incident, and denied attempting to take away healthcare benefits for nurses. A spokesperson said: “We are continuing to bargain in good faith in the hopes of reaching an agreement that is fair, reasonable, and responsible, but unfortunately just a week before a potential strike NYSNA has refused to move off of its extreme economic proposals that demand hospitals like ours spend billions of dollars on increased nursing compensation and additional hires.”\n\nThey claimed “most of the union’s claims about bargaining are untrue”, and confirmed that the hospital is taking steps to prepare in case of a strike.\n\nNew York Presbyterian blamed the union for not budging on wages. “NYSNA’s threatened strike is intended to disrupt patient care across the city,” a spokesperson said. “We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that our patients will continue to receive safe, exceptional care. We will always meet our fundamental obligation to the communities we serve.”\n\nMontefiore did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "GUATIRE, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela released citizens and foreigners from its prisons on Thursday in what a top government official described as a gesture to “seek peace” less than a week after former President Nicolás Maduro was captured by U.S. forces to face federal drug-trafficking charges in New York.\n\nJorge Rodríguez, brother of acting President Delcy Rodríguez and head of the National Assembly, said a “significant number” of people would be freed, but he was not specific about how many or provide names.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have freed political prisoners before, but the releases on Thursday were the first since Maduro was deposed. Human rights groups were encouraged by the releases, though it wasn’t clear yet whether this might represent the early stages of a government in transition or was more of a symbolic effort to please the Trump administration, which has allowed Maduro’s loyalists to stay in control even as it exerts political pressure through crippling sanctions.\n\nJournalists, lawyers and human rights activists were among those freed on Thursday, and families waited outside a notorious prison in hopes their loved ones would be among the detainees released.\n\n“Consider this a gesture by the Bolivarian government, which is broadly intended to seek peace,” Rodríguez said in an announcement publicized over TV.\n\nNGO: 863 detained for ‘political reasons’\n\nAlfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, an advocacy group for prisoners based in Caracas, praised Thursday’s release as “good news” that lifted Venezuelans’ hopes that all political detainees in the country may walk free.\n\nBut he stressed that he wanted this to become “the beginning of the dismantling of the repressive system” of Maduro’s government and not remain “a mere gesture, a charade of releasing some prisoners and incarcerating others.”\n\nDespite a widespread crackdown during the tumultuous 2024 election – in which the government said it detained 2,000 people – Venezuela's government denies that there are “political prisoners” and accuses those detained of plotting to destabilize Maduro’s government.\n\nRomero's organization said that as of Dec. 29, 2025, there were 863 people detained in Venezuela “for political reasons.”\n\nThe Spanish government announced Thursday that five Spanish citizens were among those released in Venezuela and would soon return to Spain.\n\nForeign Minister José Manuel Albares confirmed the group includes prominent Venezuelan-Spanish lawyer and human rights activist Rocío San Miguel. Speaking to Spanish broadcaster RNE, he also confirmed that Spanish citizens Andrés Martínez, José María Basoa, Ernesto Gorbe and Miguel Moreno were freed.\n\nBasoa and Martínez were arrested in Venezuela in September 2024, accused by officials of being involved in a plot to destabilize Maduro’s government as Spanish intelligence agents, allegations that Spanish authorities denied at the time. Spain’s El País newspaper reported Thursday that Gorbe had been living in Venezuela and was arrested in 2024, accused of being in the country illegally with an expired visa.\n\nA number of families of those detained rushed to wait outside of a number of Venezuelan prisons on Thursday, hoping to reunite with their loved ones.\n\nPedro Durán, 60, was among those hoping to wrap his arm around his brother Franklin Durán as he waited outside a prison in the town of Guatire, around 25 miles (43 kilometers) outside of Caracas. Durán said his brother was detained in 2021 on charges of trying to overthrow Maduro’s government — an accusation the family fiercely denies.\n\nDurán, who has been living in Spain, heard rumors that the government may be releasing a number of detainees on Wednesday and immediately bought a plane ticket from Madrid to Caracas to find his brother.\n\n“I don’t have words to express the emotion I’m feeling,” Durán said. “We’re feeling a lot of hope ... We’re just waiting now.”\n\nDespite the anticipation, fear persists in parts of the South American country as residents brace for an uncertain future.\n\n“Of course everyone here is very scared, but what more could (the government) do to us that they haven’t done already,” he said.\n\nRonal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuelan Observatory at the University of Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia, said the government periodically releases prisoners at politically strategic moments.\n\nIn July last year, Venezuela released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in exchange for getting home more than 200 migrants deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador, where they were held in a prison built to hold alleged gang members.\n\n“The regime uses them (prisoners) like a bargaining chip,” he said, adding that he and other observers will be watching not just how many people the government releases, but also whether high-profile individuals are included or if they're being released under a condition of house arrest.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration sought to assert its control over Venezuelan oil, seizing a pair of sanctioned tankers transporting petroleum and announcing plans to relax some sanctions so the U.S. can oversee the sale of Venezuela’s petroleum worldwide.\n\nBoth moves reflect the administration’s determination to make good on its effort to control the next steps in Venezuela through its vast oil resources after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged after the capture of Maduro that the U.S. will “run” the country.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "title": "New York Jets - Picking 16: A Preliminary View",
    "description": "An Early Look At The Four Most Mocked Players The Jets Could Select With The 16th Pick",
    "fullText": "Well, the season is over. The tank is complete, and after weeks of speculation, the Jets will be picking No. 2 overall.\n\nAt No. 2, there are still plenty of questions about what direction they take. If Dante Moore declares, the debate will almost certainly center on whether the Jets go quarterback, trade back, or simply take the best player on the board. That discussion is fairly straightforward and will dominate much of the early draft conversation.\n\nHowever, there’s another pick the Jets own that isn’t getting nearly the same level of attention.\n\nThanks to the Colts’ collapse down the stretch and their failure to make the playoffs, the pick they traded to the Jets now lands in the top half of the draft. For a team with holes all over the roster, that’s a massive asset.\n\nWe’ll dive much deeper into these prospects as we get closer to April, and it’s important to note that draft boards can change rapidly between January and draft night. But for now, let’s take a brief look at the four most popular players players mocked to the Jets with this pick:\n\nBailey immediately emerges as a popular potential target for the Jets.\n\nA four-year senior who began his career at Stanford before transferring to Texas Tech, Bailey has been on draft radars for the better part of the last two years. However, it was his senior season that truly launched his draft stock. After entering the year viewed as more of a mid–second-round prospect, Bailey has climbed to consensus No. 11 overall on most big boards.\n\nThe book on Bailey is fairly simple: he’s an elite college pass rusher.\n\nAfter two solid seasons at Stanford, Bailey took a major leap in his junior year, becoming one of the highest-graded pass rushers in the country. With a larger national stage at Texas Tech, he only continued that ascent, arguably becoming the most dominant pass rusher in college football this past season. With better coverage behind him, his sack total also exploded with 15 sacks this past year.\n\nBailey is the highest-graded pass rusher in the country on both true pass sets and overall snaps. He leads the nation in PRP—a PFF metric that combines sacks, hits, and hurries relative to pass-rush opportunities—and also ranks first in win rate on true pass sets, measuring how often he beats his blocker on non-penalty pass-rush snaps.\n\nThe athletic profile jumps off the page as well. Bailey is fast, explosive, and incredibly productive. He reportedly bench-pressed 405 pounds, squatted 550, and has been clocked at 22.16 mph. There’s a lot to like.\n\nThe concerns, however, are also easy to spot.\n\nBailey is undersized, listed at 250 pounds (a number that appears generous given he doesn’t look much different from the 240 pounds he was listed at during his Stanford days). That size raises legitimate questions about his ability to set the edge, hold up against the run, and rein in some of his more reckless tendencies.\n\nUltimately, there are two very different ways to view Bailey depending on the story you are going to tell yourself. On one hand, you’re getting a freaky, explosive, highly productive pass rusher, something the Jets desperately need. On the other, you may be drafting a situational edge defender who can’t consistently stay on the field for all three downs due to size limitations.\n\nWith Will McDonald already on the roster and facing similar concerns, it remains to be seen whether the Jets would be willing to take another swing on this type of profile.\n\nKeldric Faulk:\n\nWe’ll continue the trend of examining potential pass rushers at pick No. 16, but this one couldn’t be more different from David Bailey.\n\nKeldric Faulk is a specimen. If you were designing an NFL edge rusher in a lab, it would look a lot like Faulk. He stands 6’6”, carries long arms, and weighs in at 285 pounds a drastically different body type than the Jets’ current edge rushers in Will McDonald and Jermaine Johnson.\n\nFaulk is also a completely different type of player than Bailey. While Bailey lined up almost exclusively outside the offensive tackle, Faulk has been used all over the front. Over the past two seasons, he’s aligned outside the tackle roughly 55–60% of the time, but Auburn has also deployed him over tackles and even inside over guards. He’s been asked to do everything.\n\nThat versatility shows up most clearly against the run. Faulk has graded extremely well in run defense, ranking in the top 25 in both stop rate and run-defense grade in each of the last two seasons. What makes that even more impressive is his age, he’s been doing this at 19 and 20 years old in the SEC.\n\nThe pass-rushing profile, however, is very much a work in progress and that’s where the concerns begin.\n\nMost notably, Faulk took a step back as a pass rusher this season. After recording nine sacks as a 19-year-old sophomore, his sack total dropped to just two this past year. His underlying metrics tell a similar story, as he ranked outside the top 50 in both pressure rate and win rate. There is an important caveat here: pressure and win rates tend to decline when a player isn’t used primarily as a stand-up edge rusher outside the tackle. Still, the pass-rush skill set clearly needs refinement.\n\nFaulk will be one of the more fascinating evaluations in this class, particularly depending on how he tests. On first glance, he appears plenty athletic (especially for his size) and it’s notable how well he already carries his frame at just 20 years old. It’s easy to see why he’s been viewed as a mid–first-round pick at worst for much of the year.\n\nThe questions, however, are largely tied to projection.\n\nThe best-case scenario is a complete edge defender: a powerful run stopper who leverages his size and athleticism into becoming a legitimate plus pass rusher at the next level. The concern is more straightforward, he never fully develops the pass-rushing tools needed to consistently win in the NFL.\n\nThat variance is what makes Faulk such a fascinating, and potentially polarizing, option for the Jets at No. 16.\n\nMoving away from edge rusher to another position of need, wide receiver will undoubtedly be one of the most talked-about spots to address in this year’s draft especially if the Jets do select a quarterback at pick No. 2. Makai Lemon, by all accounts, appears to be a very legitimate option considering where he ranks on consensus big boards. Over the last three months of the draft process, Lemon has hovered anywhere from the early 20s to as high as No. 16, where he currently sits on several boards.\n\nLemon is a fascinating evaluation. From a production standpoint, it’s hard to find many receivers as consistently productive as he’s been. After entering USC as a highly rated recruit, Lemon broke out during his sophomore season, finishing with 52 catches for 764 yards and three touchdowns on 67 targets. From an efficiency perspective, he was outstanding—posting a high catch rate while adding an elite 3.03 yards per route run.\n\nAt just 21 years old, Lemon took another leap as a junior and emerged as one of the best wide receivers in college football. He finished the season as the highest-graded receiver in the country, totaling 79 catches, 1,156 yards, and 11 touchdowns. Among qualified Power Four receivers, he ranked third nationally in yards per route run and finished top 10 in missed tackles forced, drop rate, and passer rating when targeted. Any way you slice it, Lemon was both dominant and efficient.\n\nThe main concern with Lemon, (and the first thing evaluators will point to) is his size. Listed at 5’11”, 195 pounds, Lemon spent most of his time at USC operating out of the slot. While he did expand his role this season, he still lined up outside on just 28% of his snaps.\n\nThat leads to the obvious questions: can Lemon consistently beat press man coverage at the NFL level against bigger, more physical defensive backs? And does the lack of true top-end speed (he’s rumored to run in the 4.45–4.50 range) cap his upside? Those answers will come with time.\n\nThe Jaxson Smith-Njigba comparison is going to come up frequently throughout this draft cycle given how similar their profiles are in terms of size, production, usage, and athleticism. But one thing is clear: if you’re looking for an advanced route runner with elite production, there simply aren’t many better options in this draft than Makai Lemon.\n\nWe’ll close out this article with our final player and undoubtedly the most polarizing name on the list: Peter Woods.\n\nWoods has been in the spotlight for a long time now. The buzz around him has been loud for nearly two years, dating back to when he burst onto the scene at Clemson as a true freshman. From the very beginning, Woods was a very good player.\n\nAt just 18 years old, Woods made an immediate impact. During his freshman season, while primarily playing as a 1-tech and 3-tech, he established himself as an elite run defender. He finished as a top-eight run defender in the country by PFF grade and ranked second nationally among all defensive linemen in stop rate. For an 18-year-old freshman playing in the Power Four, that level of production is remarkable.\n\nHe followed up his breakout freshman year with another strong campaign as a sophomore. Clemson used him differently, lining him up more frequently as a traditional defensive end and even placing him outside the tackles at times. As a result, his pass-rush metrics took a step forward. Despite still spending the majority of his snaps inside, Woods graded well as a pass rusher when asked to attack the quarterback. His win rate ranked top 10 nationally among non-edge rushers, and in true pass sets—albeit on a smaller sample—he finished top 15 at the position.\n\nBecause of that trajectory, Woods entered the season as a consensus top-five prospect. He also earned a spot on Bruce Feldman’s Freaks List, where Feldman wrote:\n\n“His latest body composition scans prior to camp showed that 240 of his 310 pounds are lean muscle mass. He’s a rare combination of power and speed for a 300-plus-pounder. This offseason, Woods bench pressed 490 pounds and did 34 reps of 225. He squatted 700 pounds and power cleaned 385, ran a 4.86 40-yard dash and vertical jumped 33 inches.”\n\nUnfortunately, Woods’ junior season was a clear disappointment. He moved back exclusively to the interior, and his production and grading took a noticeable step back. From a win-rate and pressure standpoint, he fell outside the top 50 among qualified defensive linemen. It’s fair to note that producing high pressure and win rates is more difficult when playing nose tackle and interior defensive line, but even accounting for alignment, his results were underwhelming compared to peers in similar roles. The dominant run defense he showed early in his career also regressed.\n\nAs a result, Woods has slid from being a consensus top-five player on big boards to someone who could legitimately fall out of the top half of the first round on draft night.\n\nWoods remains a fascinating evaluation. From a size and athleticism standpoint, he checks every box at 6’3”, 315 pounds. He’s shown flashes of high-level play as both a run defender and a pass rusher. But it’s impossible to ignore the step back in performance this past season. Simply put, he’s well behind the sack and tackle-for-loss production you’d typically expect from a defensive lineman selected in the middle of the first round. A concern to say the least.\n\nAs previously mentioned, these rankings are cyclical by nature. While these four players are the most commonly mocked to the Jets at this point in the process, it’s unlikely they’ll be the same names we’re seeing come April once testing results and additional information start to reshape boards.\n\nWe’ll continue to monitor the class and take a deeper look at all of these prospects (including those listed above) over the coming months.",

I’m not happy about it.”\n\nBut Democrats think there’s little photographers can do to help the president.\n\nNot the photographers' fault https://t.co/EI8nukJYJK pic.twitter.com/oggK2CqUXd\n\n— Democrats (@TheDemocrats) January 6, 2026\n\n“Not the photographers’ fault,” they wrote in an X post, attaching candid images of Trump taken from less-than-flattering angles.\n\nTrump, a high-flying socialite and TV personality before he entered the White House, has long been conscious of his public image.\n\nIn October, he threw a Truth Social meltdown after TIME magazine put him on the cover using a photo taken from a low angle, which highlighted the drooping skin on his neck. It didn’t help that his hair practically disappeared into the sky above him.\n\n“They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one,” Trump wrote. “Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?”\n\nThe aging president is 6’ 3” and weighs 224 pounds, according to the results of his annual physical exam released last April. His BMI puts him in the overweight category, though the president’s physician Sean Barbabella has repeatedly cleared Trump as being in “excellent health.”\n\nTrump’s fast-food-heavy diet and love for Diet Coke are unlikely to see him shed pounds soon. Florida state senator Joe Gruters once said he saw Trump eat McDonald’s fries, a Filet-O-Fish, a Quarter Pounder, and a Big Mac all in one sitting.\n\nAs for exercise, Trump doesn’t care for much physical activity outside of the golf course.\n\n“I just don’t like it. It’s boring,” Trump told The Wall Street Journal about his opinion of exercise. “To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that’s not for me.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment about the Democratic Party’s post.",

    "description": "Growing up in Fort Lauderdale and moving to New York City has taught me that the cities we dream of won't always meet our expectations, and that's OK.",
    "fullText": "For nearly 20 years of my life, I lived in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe beaches, palm trees, and Pub Subs (sub sandwiches from Publix, for those unfamiliar) that were part of other people's vacations were staples of my everyday life.\n\nMaybe that's why I started yearning for somewhere that wasn't as calm and steady as I was used to — somewhere like New York City.\n\nI visited NYC for the first time in 2016, and four visits later, I made it my goal to live there one day.\n\nEach trip welcomed me with new experiences and places to explore. Getting to walk out of my hotel with no set itinerary and discover local coffee shops or pocket parks was a feeling I genuinely believed couldn't be replicated elsewhere.\n\nUnlike my days in Florida, which sometimes felt repetitive, New York always felt fresh.\n\nSo, in July, I made the leap and moved to the Big Apple. Like other transplants in their early 20s, I wanted to feel like I was living in a place that mattered, and the city's energy was intoxicating.\n\nDay by day, since moving to New York City, I've become more aware of the realities that come with actually living in the place I dreamed of.\n\nAs a tourist, I curated my experiences, planned my trips around perfect weather, and was able to appreciate a slowed-down version of the city.\n\nBut living in the city comes with a pace that's impossible to ignore.\n\nPublic transportation is crowded, fast-paced, and something I've learned to take into account when planning my days. I've had to learn to make decisions faster, leave earlier than necessary, and accept that even the smallest disruptions can throw off my entire day.\n\nPlus, the so-called \"New York tax\" that forces me to spend at least $30 the moment I walk out the door has been a humbling dose of reality.\n\nMoments like schlepping groceries in bad weather have made me miss how South Florida provides more space to slow down, too.\n\nI used to see New York City as a fantasy, but as a resident, I'm realizing that maybe that was the version I created for the \"me\" who was just passing through.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still see New York City's appeal — just not in the ways I used to. In the same way tourists flock to the beaches I grew up on, I now see NYC as a destination people project their biggest hopes onto.\n\nAfter months of living here, I've come to realize that the mundane aspects of everyday life are what make the city feel like home, from catching an express train just before it leaves the station to waving to my building's super.\n\nAnd now, I'm able to take these lessons home to Fort Lauderdale when I visit, which I've come to see in a whole new light.\n\nOn my first trip home, the beaches I used to visit every other month, and the constant hot weather I'd tried to avoid, carried a sense of charm I had really never appreciated growing up.\n\nExperiencing it from the perspective of someone who left made me feel grateful for all the little details I used to overlook.\n\nAfter that visit, I finally understood: A place can lose its appeal once it becomes familiar, but that doesn't mean it's no longer special. A dream city may never truly live up to the images we create of it, and that's OK.\n\nI'm learning to love New York's imperfections and am enjoying rediscovering the beauty of South Florida as well.\n\nBut moreover, I'm learning to accept that home doesn't have to be a place that constantly amazes me. It's where I choose to keep building, flaws and all — and for now, that place is New York City.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — Pamela Smart, who is serving life in prison for orchestrating the murder of her husband by her teenage student in 1990, is seeking to overturn her conviction over what her lawyers claim were several constitutional violations.\n\nThe petition for habeas corpus relief was filed Monday in New York, where she is being held at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, and, in New Hampshire, where the murder happened.\n\n“Ms. Smart’s trial unfolded in an environment that no court had previously confronted — wall-to-wall media coverage that blurred the line between allegation and evidence,” Jason Ott, who is part of Smart’s legal team, said in a statement. “This petition challenges whether a fair adversarial process took place.”\n\nThe move comes about seven months after New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte rejected a request for a sentence reduction hearing. Ayotte said she reviewed the case and decided it was not deserving of a hearing.\n\nA spokesman for the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision said it would have no comment about the petition.\n\nA spokeman for New Hampshire’s attorney general said it would not comment on pending litigation “other than to note that the State maintains Ms. Smart received a fair trial and that her convictions were lawfully obtained and upheld on appeal.”\n\nIn their petition, lawyers for the 57-year-old Smart argue that prosecutors misled the jury by providing them with inaccurate transcripts of surreptitiously recorded conversations of Ms. Smart that included words that were not audible on the recordings. Among the words they claim weren't audible but in the transcript were the word killed in the sentence “you had your husband killed,\" the word busted in the sentence “I'm gonna be busted\" and the word murder in the sentence “this would have been the perfect murder.”\n\n“Modern science confirms what common sense has always told us: when people are handed a script, they inevitably hear the words they are shown,” Smart’s attorney, Matthew Zernhelt, said in a statement. “Jurors were not evaluating the recordings independently — they were being directed toward a conclusion, and that direction decided the verdict.”\n\nLawyers also argued the conviction should be overturned because the verdict was tainted by the media attention and due to faulty instructions to the jury. They argued jurors were told they must find that Smart acted with premeditation, not told they must consider only evidence presented at trial.\n\nThey also argued the trial court gave her a mandatory life sentence without parole for being an accomplice to first-degree murder, despite New Hampshire not mandating that sentence for the charge.\n\nSmart was a 22-year-old high school media coordinator when she began an affair with a 15-year-old boy who later fatally shot her husband, Gregory Smart, in Derry. The shooter was freed in 2015 after serving a 25-year sentence. Although Smart denied knowledge of the plot, she was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and other crimes and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nIt took until 2024 for Smart to take full responsibility for her husband’s death. In a video released in June, she said she spent years deflecting blame “almost as if it was a coping mechanism.”\n\nSmart’s trial was a media circus and one of America’s first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school employee and a student. The student, William Flynn, testified that Smart told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything if they divorced and that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. Flynn and three other teens cooperated with prosecutors and all have since been released.\n\nFlynn and 17-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts’ Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man’s throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. Both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and were sentenced to 28 years to life. They were granted parole in 2015. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released.\n\nThe case inspired Joyce Maynard’s 1992 book “To Die For” and the 1995 film of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix.",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - The 92-year-old judge overseeing the Nicolas Maduro case has said he displays a Hebrew scripture from the Torah on the wall of his Manhattan chambers: “Tzedek, tzedek tirdof” — “Justice, justice you shall pursue.\"\n\nAn Orthodox Jew who has been ​on the bench for almost three decades, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein has been outspoken about how he tries to promote fairness ‌and the impact of his faith on his judicial philosophy.\n\nHellerstein opened the court hearing on Monday by saying he wants a fair trial for the ousted Venezuelan leader, who pleaded not ‌guilty on Monday to narco-terrorism charges.\n\n\"That's my job, and that's my intent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nON THE SEVENTH DAY HE CONTEMPLATES\n\nHellerstein said in a 2020 podcast that he schedules sentencing hearings for Fridays, so that he can spend Shabbat — the Jewish sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday nightfall — reflecting on whether the prison sentence he handed down was appropriate.\n\nHellerstein has ruled against President Donald Trump in recent years. He has also spoken up when he believes lawyers are not ⁠best serving their clients.\n\nIn a 2013 law review article, ‌he wrote that some lawyers were \"outraged\" and accused him of \"arrogation of power\" when he rejected a $675 million settlement negotiated between New York City and injured first responders who raced to the World Trade Center after the attacks of ‍September 11, 2001.\n\nHellerstein concluded that, while no statute or rule clearly addressed whether the deal needed his blessing, he had inherent authority to reject it as inadequate.\n\nThe attorneys ended up presenting Hellerstein with a new settlement that added $125 million for victims.\n\nHellerstein \"is a man of strongly held convictions and he seeks to find a way to harmonize ​the law with his understanding of justice,\" said Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who has observed Hellerstein on the bench.\n\nHellerstein has spoken ‌candidly about how his Jewish values affect his decision-making.\n\n\"As a judge, and as a Jew, I consider that everything I do reflects God and affects His image,\" he wrote in the 2013 article.\n\nIn the 2020 podcast, Hellerstein said he believes he was \"the first Orthodox boy employed by a gentile or Jewish firm in New York City.\"\n\n\"I'm pleased to say that after me there were others, and some credited me with having broken the precedent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nHellerstein already had a long career before President Bill Clinton nominated him to the federal bench in 1998.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1960, Hellerstein served in the ⁠Judge Advocate General's Corps, the legal arm of the United States Army.\n\nIn 1960, Hellerstein ​joined the now-defunct firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, where he ended up practicing for much ​of his career.\n\nA HISTORY OF REBUKING TRUMP'S LEGAL GAMBITS\n\nIn a high-profile case in 2020, Hellerstein ordered the release of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen, after Trump's Justice Department tried to revoke his home confinement and return him to jail.\n\nHellerstein ‍concluded Trump's administration was retaliating against Cohen ⁠for writing a book.\n\nIn 2023, Hellerstein denied a request by Trump to move to federal court his New York criminal case relating to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was tried in state court and found guilty of 34 felony ⁠counts.\n\nIn May 2025, Hellerstein rejected an effort by the Trump administration to use a wartime law to send alleged gang members to Venezuela, saying the men had been improperly denied ‌their day in court.\n\n“This is the United States of America,\" he said. \"People are being thrown out of the country because of ‌their tattoos.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nA potential New York bidding war could be forming around Kyle Tucker, and if the market goes that way, the New York Yankees and New York Mets could find themselves battling it out.\n\nEarly predictions had Tucker in the $400 million range, but as the offseason has unfolded, that no longer feels safe to say, and that matters for two teams that are always willing to spend some money when it matters most.\n\nTucker is still viewed as one of the best players in baseball. He impacts the game on both sides of the baseball, can really swing it, and fits most lineups.\n\nFor the Yankees, he’d provide another middle-of-the-order presence with Aaron Judge. For the Mets, he’d represent another franchise bat to pair with Juan Soto.\n\nBoth New York teams have shown a willingness to spend, and both could use a player of his caliber after disappointing years a season ago.\n\nAccording to Jon Heyman, both squads have checked in on the left-handed hitting slugger.\n\n“Though he might not reach the early $400M predictions after his typically excellent but ultimately unsatisfying platform season with the Cubs, the all-around star (he, Mookie Betts, Aaron Judge, Juan Soto and José Ramírez are the only players to post a 4 WAR the past five seasons) should still be worth $300M-plus based on past deals and comps. But if he doesn’t mind resetting, the Dodgers could become an option for a short term and high AAV. The Yankees and Mets (and all big-market teams) have checked in, but Cody Bellinger’s versatility and lower price tag make him the New York mark — at least for now,” he wrote.\n\nIf Tucker’s asking price continues to come down, don’t be surprised if New York City turns into the center of his free-agency race.\n\nKyle Tucker now viewed as ‘fallback option’ for Yankees amid Cody Bellinger rumors\n\nAmid Jazz Chisholm rumors, Yankees predicted to sign Blue Jays’ Bo Bichette to $180 million contract\n\nRed Sox have shown interest in an All-Star the Yankees have been linked to in trade talks\n\nMariners reportedly willing to move top prospects for Yankees trade target, possibly take New York out of contention\n\nCubs predicted to make a deal for former Yankees dud and Blue Jays infielder who ruined World Series\n\nEx-Yankees fan favorite and top prospect linked to American League contender after hitting .318 last season",

    "description": "Former Arizona Cardinals head coach will apparently get a look from New York.",
    "fullText": "Kliff Kingsbury is leaving his job as Washington Commanders offensive coordinator to “pursue other opportunities.” One of those opportunities is likely to be with the New York Giants, where Kingsbury is expected to interview for the team’s vacant head-coaching position.\n\nKingsbury was offensive coordinator with Washington the past two seasons. His parting with the Commanders was described as a mutual decision between Kingsbury and Washington head coach Dan Quinn.\n\nKingsbury was praised for his work with the Commanders during Jayden Daniels’ 2024 rookie season as Washington went to the playoffs and had one of the league’s better offenses. With Daniels suffering through an injury-plagued 2025, the Commanders won just five games and Kingsbury’s offense was not nearly as prolific.\n\nDaniels and other Commanders players are apparently not happy with Kingsbury’s exit.\n\nKingsbury was head coach of the Arizona Cardinals for four seasons, from 2019-2022. He compiled a 28-37-1 (.432 winning percentage). His best season was 2021, when the Cardinals went 11-6 and lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams.\n\nPrior to Arizona, Kingsbury went 35-40 (.467) in six seasons as head coach at Texas Tech.\n\nI discussed Kingsbury with David Harrison, Commanders insider for Locked on Commanders, recently. Harrison said he would “lean to the side of no,” when I asked him if he thought Kingsbury should be in the conversation for the Giants.\n\n“I think that to be fair, like I don’t get to see, and you know this obviously, but to those who don’t, I don’t get to see Cliff do his day-to-day job and and all those things and full interaction with the players. So there there’s got to be a big grain of salt taken with I think any media member’s opinion on whether or not a guy would be a good head coach,” Harrison said. “But just looking at some of the things I can look at, Cliff still seems to be a guy who is very much kind of stuck in his way.\n\n“Kliff Kingsbury at the end of the day when he feels the he has the excuse, when he feels he has the reason, he’s going to revert back to what he wants to do. It’s not really about what is best for my team. It’s not and and don’t me wrong, like he thinks it’s best for his team, right? I should I should definitely put that in there. It’s not like he’s saying, “I don’t care that that’s what’s best. I want to do what I want to do.” Like, he thinks it’s best for his team. But what he doesn’t have is the situational awareness to understand that like, ‘No, it’s not’.\n\n“… until the head man says, “Hey dude, this is what we’re going to do.” He’s not going to see it himself. And if I’m hiring a head coach, I need a guy that can see the picture for what it is, not see the confirmation bias, that he wants to tell himself that he’s right all the time. And I just don’t think that Cliff is there.”",

    "fullText": "A new study has bolstered a scathing dissent from liberal Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that warned the court appeared to favor the rich.\n\nThe study, published Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research, investigated whether the Supreme Court has contributed to rising income inequality by ruling in favor of policies that favor wealthy parties.\n\nIts authors—two academics from Columbia University in New York and one from Yale University—found that in cases pitting the rich against the poor, Republican appointees were far more likely than their Democratic colleagues to side with the wealthier party.\n\nBack in 1953, Democratic and Republican appointees were statistically indistinguishable on the issue, with justices appointed by members of both parties favoring the rich in 45 percent of cases on average.\n\nThe average Democratic justice cast a “pro-rich” vote—which was defined as a vote that would directly shift resources to the party that was more likely to be wealthy, including votes that supported businesses over consumers or workers—just 35 percent of the time.\n\n“The results reveal a steady increase in polarization, mostly due to Republican appointees whose decisions rise from about 50 percent pro-rich share to a 70 percent pro-rich share over the course of 70 years,” the study’s authors, Andrea Prat, a Columbia economics professor, Jacob Spitz, a Columbia PhD student, Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, and wrote.\n\nThe findings also supported a June dissent authored by Brown Jackson, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe justices held 7-2 that oil and gas companies had legal standing to challenge California’s environmental regulations requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered ones.\n\n“This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens,” Brown Jackson wrote. “I worry that the fuel industry’s gain comes at a reputational cost for this Court, which is already viewed by many as being overly sympathetic to corporate interests.”\n\nThat perception could be contributing to an overall drop in public confidence in the court, according to the Times. The Daily Beast has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.\n\nThe court’s favorability rating has plunged by 22 points over the past five years, from 70 percent in 2020 to a near-record low 48 percent late last year, the Pew Research Center reported in September.\n\nAnd although a vast majority of Americans, or 86 percent, think the justices should be non-partisan, 56 percent said the justices were doing only a fair or poor job of keeping their political views out of their legal decision-making.",

    "description": "The New York Rangers’ 3-2 loss to the Utah Mammoth was overshadowed by Igor Shetserkin’s injury scare.",
    "fullText": "The New York Rangers’ 3-2 loss to the Utah Mammoth was overshadowed by Igor Shetserkin’s injury scare.\n\nIn the first period, with JJ Peterka driving to the net, Shesterkin’s leg seemed to get caught in an awkward position.\n\nAfter lying on the ice in agony for over a minute, Shesterkin made his way to the locker room with the help of a trainer, unable to put any weight on his leg.\n\nMike Sullivan confirmed that Shesterkin is being evaluated for a lower-body injury, but he did not delve into much detail regarding his long-term status.\n\n“I mean, obviously we don't want him to get hurt,” Sullivan said. “He's an important part of this team, and hopefully it's not too serious. I don't have an answer for you because obviously they're gonna do more more testament right now he's being evaluated.”\n\nWhile it’s never safe to assume anything, Shesterkin’s injury certainly did look concerning, and if he is indeed slated to miss a long period of time, the Rangers are in a heap of trouble.\n\nShesterkin serves as the Rangers’ engine, and his loss for any period of time is extremely problematic for the Blueshirts.\n\n“There are certain guys that drive your team. He's one of them for us,” Sullivan said of Shesterkin. “He's an elite player at his position. I think he's one of the very best in the game. When you lose a player like that for any length of time, those types of players are difficult to replace.”\n\nJonathan Quick ultimately filled in for the injured Shesterkin and recorded 14 saves on 17 shots. He set the tone, making some crucial stops while also showing a level of passion, specifically when Daniil But bumped into him, and decided to go after him.\n\nIf Shesterkin is to miss time, the Rangers will be forced to rely on the 39-year-old Quick.\n\n“He's a fierce competitor. He's still an excellent goalie,” Sullivan said of Quick. “He's one of the leaders in that room, for good reason. His body of work speaks for itself. If you ask my opinion, I think he's a first ballot Hall of Famer with what he's accomplished in the game. He loves the game, and he loves to compete, and he's very capable.”\n\nThe game, in which the Rangers were unable to hold onto a one-goal lead in the third period, en route to an overtime loss, feels meaningless due to what could possibly be at stake with Shesterkin’s injury and the ripple effect it would have on the rest of the team.\n\nAs it stands right now, the Rangers are three points out of a wild-card spot with three games in hand as it will be a dog fight to make the playoffs.\n\nIgor Shesterkin Exits Game Against Mammoth After Suffering Scary-Looking Injury In the first period of the New York <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/new-york-rangers\">Rangers</a>’ Monday night game against the Utah Mammoth, Igor Shesterkin suffered a scary-looking lower-body injury.&nbsp;\n\nThe direction Blueshirts’ general manager Chris Drury will go at the trade deadline would drastically change if Shesterkin’s injury were to be serious.\n\nWhen talking on WFAN Radio, Rangers owner James Dolan gave a vote of confidence to Drury, preaching patience as the team tries to build a culture under Sullivan, essentially ensuring Drury is not on the hot seat despite the team’s disastrous 2024-25 campaign and inconsistencies through the first half of this season.\n\nStaying a float in the Eastern Conference is a difficult task without Shesterkin.\n\nIf Shesterkin is out for a long period of time, Drury may be forced to take a selling approach at the trade deadline, directly impacting Artemi Panarin, who is set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer and is still without a long-term contract extension past the 2025-26 season.\n\nThere’s a lot that hinders on Shesterkin, and the severity of his injury will in all likelihood be revealed within the next couple of days.",

    "fullText": "Knicks owner crushes dreams of fans hoping for Giannis Antetokounmpo trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNew York Knicks fans hoping that the team will trade for disgruntled Milwaukee Bucks star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo will be disappointed by recent comments from Knicks owner James Dolan.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on The Carton Show, Dolan said that the organization is very happy with the roster as currently constructed and doesn’t see any major moves on the horizon.\n\n“We love our team right now. They have chemistry. They all like each other,” Dolan said. “I’ve never seen a locker room more copacetic. There’s a lot of energy in there. Leon [Rose] can always overrule me, but I don’t see us making a big change. This group can win a championship. I believe that.”\n\nLast year, the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2000, and they're looking to improve upon that finish this season. Dolan seems to believe that health and continuity is what the Knicks need to take the next step, not a major shakeup.\n\n“Look how far we got with our group last year,” Dolan said. “Then take a look at who was playing and who wasn’t. We had injuries. Now we’re going into the second half of the season with more depth. If we stay healthy, we’ll go into the playoffs in much better condition.”\n\nThe trade deadline is about a month away, and New York has been frequently mentioned as a potential landing spot for Antetokounmpo. But, if Dolan is to be taken at his word, that won’t be happening any time soon.\n\nPerhaps if the Knicks have an early exit from the postseason, Dolan could change his stance regarding the roster over the offseason. But for now, Knicks fans shouldn’t hold their breath for an Antetokounmpo trade.\n\nNew York Knicks owner shares harsh criticism of Tom Thibodeau\n\nJames Dolan explains why Knicks won't hang NBA Cup banner",

I am still president of my country,\" Maduro told the judge through an interpreter when asked for his plea on narco-terrorism and weapons charges.\n\nHe was then interrupted by the judge, who interjected, \"A not guilty plea will be entered on behalf of Mr. Maduro.\"\n\nIt was one of several dramatic moments during the roughly 30-minute hearing, which Maduro used to protest his capture by US forces.\n\nWhen he entered the courtroom, flanked by US marshals, he wished everyone a \"Happy New Year\" in English and locked eyes with members of the press sitting in the back of the courtroom.\n\nLater, as the hearing wrapped up, a person sitting in the fourth row of the courtroom gallery stood to say Maduro would pay in the name of the Venezuelan people.\n\n\"I am a man of God, and I am a war prisoner,\" Maduro responded in Spanish as US marshals escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were arraigned on an indictment alleging a conspiracy to import cocaine and a related conspiracy to possess machine guns and other \"destructive devices\" in furtherance of drug trafficking. Maduro also faces a narco-terrorism conspiracy charge.\n\nThe two wore standard-issue jail garb of navy smocks over orange long-sleeve shirts with khaki pants. At their seats in the courtroom, they wore headphones to listen to their court-appointed translators.\n\nWhen he stood to address the judge, Maduro held on to the arms of his chair as he rose unsteadily. Flores, her blonde hair tied back in a bun, had several small bandages on her face. She sustained injuries during her \"abduction\" in Caracas, one of her attorneys said.\n\nDuring the packed noon hearing, US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein read the couple a summary of their charges and informed the Venezuelan president and first lady of their rights before the pair entered not guilty pleas. He addressed them as \"Mr. Maduro\" and \"Ms. Flores.\"\n\nWhen asked to confirm his identity at the start of the hearing, Maduro began by stating in firmly spoken Spanish that he is \"Presidente constitutional de la Republica Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I am here, kidnapped, since January 3, Saturday,\" Maduro said. I was captured in my home in Caracas, Venezuela.\"\n\n\"There will be a time and place to go into all this,\" the judge interrupted.\n\nAsked for her plea, Flores spoke in a quiet, hoarse voice.\n\n\"Not guilty. Completely innocent,\" she said through a court interpreter.\n\nBoth Maduro and Flores are facing health issues and will need medical attention while awaiting trial, their lawyers said.\n\n\"Miss Flores, during her abduction, sustained significant injuries, as you can see today here in court,\" defense lawyer Mark Donnelly told the judge. \"There's a belief that she may have a fracture or severe bruising on her ribs,\" the lawyer added.\n\nThe 25-page indictment filed against Maduro, his wife, son, and three others alleges that for over 25 years, Venezuelan leaders \"have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.\"\n\nMaduro was represented in court by Barry Pollack, an attorney best known for also representing WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange. Flores was represented by the Texas-based attorney Mark Donnelly and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.\n\nThe attorneys said they would not seek bail for Maduro or Flores on Monday, but reserved the right to seek it at a later date. Pollack told Hellerstein he anticipated \"voluminous and complicated legal practice.\"\n\n\"Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,\" Pollack said. \"He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.\"\n\nHellerstein scheduled the next court hearing for March 17.\n\nMaduro has long been a target of the US Justice Department. Manhattan federal prosecutors first indicted him in 2020, accusing him of heading the drug-trafficking network, the Cartel de los Soles.\n\nIn 2015, the nephews of Maduro's wife, Flores, were arrested in Haiti and charged with drug trafficking by the same office handling the Maduro case.\n\nThe indictment says Maduro is \"at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.\"\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump said the US captured the Venezuelan president following large-scale strikes on the South American nation.\n\nTrump said the US will \"run\" Venezuela until a \"safe, proper, and judicious transition\" can be facilitated. It remains unclear how the Trump administration would carry out this plan and for how long.",

    "fullText": "What could have been for the New York Giants in Week 18...\n\nAfter losing control of the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL draft following a Week 17 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, the Giants still had an opportunity to secure the top spot this past Sunday -- with some help.\n\nA loss to the Dallas Cowboys and an unlikely Raiders win (with a few other dominoes that ultimately fell into place), the Giants would have picked first overall in April. And as fate would have it, the stars aligned with a single exception: Big Blue themselves.\n\nThe Giants came out on fire and dismantled the Dallas Cowboys, 34-17, ending any hope of securing No. 1 overall before the Raiders even played. And perhaps that's why the outcomes of the afternoon slate of games sting a bit.\n\nUltimately, the Raiders did their part. They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, 14-12, and did so in a way that is ironic for the Giants.\n\nSince 2014, 21% of all 60-plus-yard field goals have come against the Giants. All 21% have come late in the fourth quarter or in overtime. So it's only fitting that Las Vegas picked up their victory with a 60-yard field goal -- a career-long for kicker Daniel Carlson.\n\nWowza. #Raiders K Daniel Carlson just drilled a 60-yard FG for the win.\n\nRaiders will still have the No. 1 overall pick. The Chiefs draft position will also improve.pic.twitter.com/cQKPA1Wf0V\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) January 5, 2026\n\nUnderstandably, Giants fans reacted with frustration as the kick sailed through the uprights.\n\nIn the end, the kick and the Raiders' victory meant nothing for the Giants because the \"damage\" had already been done. Still, for Giants Nation, being on the positive end of a 60-yard field goal would have been a nice change of pace.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Another 60-plus-yard field goal taunts New York Giants fans",

    "description": "The Giants wrap up their 2025 season Sunday.",
    "fullText": "The Giants finish yet another miserable season Sunday, when they host the Cowboys.\n\nSo which Giants players — including injured guys who won’t play Sunday — will not return to the team in 2026?\n\nLet’s take a look at the players who definitely will be gone and those who are on the fence, as general manager Joe Schoen (who has overseen so much losing) is somehow trending toward returning.\n\nCUT CANDIDATES WHO LIKELY WON’T RETURN\n\nRB Devin Singletary, K Graham Gano, OT James Hudson, WR Jalin Hyatt\n\nAnalysis: The Giants have their young running back duo for 2026 (Cam Skattebo and Tyrone Tracy). They’d free up $5.25 million in salary cap space by cutting Singletary. Gano is a no-brainer cut ($4.5 million savings). Ditto for Hudson ($5.5 million savings).\n\nHyatt can’t even get on the field. A brutal third-round pick by Schoen. His cap number for 2026 isn’t crazy ($1.7 million), but the Giants would free up $1.5 million of that by releasing him. Why bother retaining him?\n\nMLB Bobby Okereke, LG Jon Runyan\n\nAnalysis: The main issue here is that the Giants would need to find quality replacement starters. The four guys in that first group are much more expendable. But releasing Okereke and Runyan is tempting if only because of the cap savings — $9 million and $9.25 million, respectively.\n\nPENDING FREE AGENTS WHO LIKELY WON’T RETURN\n\nQB Russell Wilson, OL Evan Neal, DT Rakeem Nunez-Roches, RG Greg Van Roten, OL Josh Ezeudu\n\nAnalysis: The Wilson signing failed spectacularly. (Expect him to retire.) Ditto for Schoen drafting Neal (seventh overall) and Ezeudu (third round) in 2022. Two more wasted picks. Nunez-Roches, who turns 33 in July, can no longer stop the run. Van Roten is solid but not spectacular ­— and about to turn 36. The Giants need a younger right guard.\n\nPENDING FREE AGENTS ON THE FENCE\n\nRT Jermaine Eluemunor, WR Wan’Dale Robinson, TE Chris Manhertz, LS Casey Kreiter, CB Cor’Dale Flott, WR Gunner Olszewski, TE Daniel Bellinger, S Dane Belton, ILB Micah McFadden, DT D.J. Davidson\n\nAnalysis: Robinson and Flott are the Giants’ top in-house free agents, and Schoen should work hard to re-sign both. Robinson gives the Giants a slippery presence in the slot, while Flott blossomed into a very good outside corner in 2025. Both would be significant losses if they depart.\n\nEluemunor is a bit trickier, since he is 31. But he pass-blocked well while playing on a two-year contract from 2024-25. You could make a legit case for bringing him back with a short-term commitment.\n\nThe other guys here are lower-profile players.\n\nBellinger lost his starting job to Theo Johnson in 2024, so he probably doesn’t even want to come back. Manhertz is a solid veteran presence. He is worth keeping as a backup, especially since he won’t be expensive. Kreiter will provide special teams consistency with Gano out the door.\n\nOlszewski is an OK returner, but not great. Belton has turned into a strong special teams player, though he isn’t starter material on defense. The Giants could easily move on from Davidson, who is inconsistent. McFadden was trending upward, but he got hurt in Week 1 and missed the season.\n\nCowboys vs. Giants free live stream: How to watch NFL game online (1/4/26)\n\nWhere to watch Cowboys vs. Giants free live stream today (1/4/26) without Streameast\n\nHow to watch NFL RedZone online without cable for Week 18 (1/4/26) | Free trials, live stream, cost\n\nGiants-Cowboys weather: Ice, wind and injuries loom over showdown at MetLife Stadium",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees have not made any major moves this offseason, whether it's a trade or a free agent deal.\n\nBut the offseason can move quickly, and a new rumor is drawing up some hype for the Yankees in their next potential move this winter.\n\nAccording to Ken Rosenthal and Chris Kirschner of The Athletic, the Yankees are reportedly in trade talks with the Miami Marlins over a 6'5'' right-hander who would be an incredible pickup for New York.\n\n\"With uncertainty around their starting rotation to begin the season,\" The Athletic duo report, \"the New York Yankees are talking to the Miami Marlins about a potential trade for starting pitcher Edward Cabrera, league sources told The Athletic.\"\n\nEdward Cabrera is an interesting right-handed starter who is 27 years old and under control through the 2028 MLB season.\n\nThis report from Rosenthal and Kirschner is a big one, as the Yankees, for the first time in a while, are seemingly making progress towards a big offseason move.\n\nAfter not showing interest in retaining Devin Williams and Luke Weaver, and plenty of other op names sign with new teams this offseason, there was concern about what the Yankees would do this winter.\n\nMore: Yankees officially announce signing of veteran infielder\n\nFortunately, this update from The Athletic is a bit of good news, as Cabrera, a right-handed starter, would be an incredible pickup if the Yankees can make a deal work.\n\nHe's coming off a strong 2025 campaign, where he had a 3.53 ERA in 26 starts with 2.8 bWAR, and 150 strikeouts in 137.2 innings pitched.\n\nWhile he's not pitched a full 32-game season, and has dealt with some injuries and inconsistencies in his big-league career, the promise he's shown is more than worth investing in.\n\nCabrera is one of the top starters who could be dealt this offseason, and if the Yankees, now in talks with the Marlins, can make this deal work, it would be a huge coup for New York after a lackluster offseason to this point.\n\nYankees' Cody Bellinger free agent rumor is bad news for potential re-signing\n\nYankees' young slugger named potential 'breakout candidate' for 2026\n\nYankees could pursue Nationals' 'ace potential' All-Star\n\nAngels sign ex-Yankees, Braves, Padres reliever to one-year deal\n\nEx-Yankees fan favorite and top prospect linked to American League contender after hitting .318 last season",

Whether you're pessimistic or optimistic, it's definitely not the good kind of history either.\n\nThe Jets will play the Bills at 4:25 P.M. today, and if they do not get an interception against Josh Allen, they will have gone through the entire season without getting a pick against an opposing quarterback. Making them the first team in NFL history to do so.\n\nThe projected starters this week do not necessarily have a history of turning the ball over, as the starters against the Bills have accounted for only 11 turnovers across their careers. Interceptions have been a bit of a foreign concept for the New York Jets for several years, but to go an entire season without having an interception is definitely something worth noting.\n\nThis offseason, the Jets will not focus solely on defense. Still, the franchise is aware of the shortcomings in competing in the NFL: being physical, playing fast, and forcing turnovers will be a priority in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: New York Jets are on the brink of history, and not the good kind",

    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores are reportedly awaiting their first court appearance at a Brooklyn jail famous for its poor conditions.\n\nNumerous publications, including The Wall Street Journal, have reported that the pair were escorted to the Metropolitan Detention Center late Saturday after arriving by plane in New York.\n\nMDC, which has yet to confirm the transfer to Business Insider, has been home to numerous high-profile defendants facing trial in New York City, including music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of fallen bitcoin exchange FTX, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of aiding the sex trafficking operation of the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nLuigi Mangioni has been housed at MDC while awaiting trial for the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe jail has been widely criticized over the years for its poor conditions, having been described as \"inhumane\" and \"hell on earth.\"\n\nLast year, the Legal Aid Society issued a press release lamenting the jail's \"documented history of violence, medical neglect, and human and civil rights violations.\" It cited reports of no heat during the winter and \"maggot-infested food.\"\n\nIn 2024, a federal judge in Brooklyn made headlines when he carved out a special exemption during sentencing to help a defendant avoid the MDC. The judge ruled that if the 74-year-old, convicted of tax fraud, were assigned to the MDC, he could serve his time under house arrest, The New York Times reported.\n\nIn March, Brooklyn federal prosecutors announced charges against 25 defendants in 12 separate cases tied to violence and contraband smuggling at the jail, which is located in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn.\n\n\"Over the years, MDC has become synonymous with egregious neglect and abuse with the people incarcerated,\" the Legal Aid Society said in a June press release opposing ICE detentions at the jail.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shocked the world on Saturday when he announced that the US had captured the Venezuelan president and his wife after a \"large-scale strike\" on Venezuela.\n\nTrump has said the US is \"going to run the country\" until it can facilitate a safe transition of power, and that US oil companies will now be free to \"spend billions\" on development in the South American nation.\n\nMaduro has been in the US Department of Justice's crosshairs for years, and in 2020, Manhattan federal prosecutors indicted him as a leader of the Cartel de Las Soles, its name for the alleged drug-trafficking organization run by Venezuela's military and political elite.\n\nAn expanded indictment unsealed on Saturday added as defendants Maduro's wife and son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra, identified in the indictment as \"The Prince.\" It accused them of participating in a wide-ranging effort to traffic drugs to the US to enrich themselves.",

    "fullText": "Less than 24 hours after throngs of ecstatic supporters poured into Manhattan for his history-making inauguration, Zohran Mamdani began his first full day of work with a routine familiar to many New Yorkers: trudging to the subway from a cramped apartment.\n\nBundled against the frigid temperature and seemingly fighting off a cold, he set out Friday morning from the one-bedroom apartment in Queens that he shares with his wife. But unlike most commuters, Mamdani’s trip was documented by a photo and video crew, and periodically interrupted by neighbors wishing him luck.\n\nThe 34-year-old democratic socialist, whose victory was hailed as a watershed moment for the progressive movement, has now begun the task of running the nation’s largest city: signing orders, announcing appointments, facing questions from the press — and answering for some of the actions he took in his first hours.\n\nBut first, the symbolism-laden day one commute.\n\nFlanked by security guards and a small clutch of aides on a Manhattan-bound train, he agreed to several selfies with wide-eyed riders, then moved to a corner seat of the train to review his briefing materials.\n\nWhen a pair of French tourists, confused by the hubbub, approached Mamdani, he introduced himself as “the new mayor of New York.” They seemed doubtful. He held up the morning’s copy of the New York Daily News, featuring his smiling face, as proof.\n\nMamdani, a Democrat, is hardly alone among city mayors in using the transit system to communicate relatability. His predecessor, Eric Adams, also rode the subway on his first day, and both Bill de Blasio and Michael Bloomberg made a habit out of it, particularly when seeking to make a political point.\n\nWithin minutes of Mamdani entering City Hall, the images of him riding public transit had lit up social media.\n\nIf the ride served as a well-timed photo-op, it also seemed to reflect Mamdani’s pledge, made in his inaugural speech, to ensure his “government looks and lives like the people it represents.”\n\nHis other early actions have also seemed to underscore that priority.\n\nAfter centering much of his campaign on making rent cheaper for New Yorkers, Mamdani raced from his inauguration ceremony Thursday to a Brooklyn apartment building lobby, drawing boisterous cheers from the tenants union as he pledged that the city would ramp up an ongoing legal fight against the allegedly negligent landlord.\n\nMamdani’s next action, meanwhile, showed the unusual scrutiny faced by his nascent administration, particularly around his criticism of Israel and outspoken support for the Palestinian cause.\n\nIn an effort to give his government a “clean slate,” he revoked a slate of executive orders issued by Adams late in his term, including two related to Israel: one that officially adopted a contentious definition of antisemitism that includes certain criticism of Israel, and another barring city agencies and employees from boycotting or divesting from the country.\n\nThe move drew swift backlash from some Jewish groups, including allegations from the Israeli government posted to social media that Mamdani had poured “antisemitic gasoline on an open fire.”\n\nWhen a journalist on Friday asked about the revoked orders, Mamdani read from prepared remarks, promising his administration would be “relentless in its effort to combat hate and division.” He noted that he had left in place the Mayor’s Office to Combat Antisemitism.\n\nMamdani also announced the creation of a “mass engagement” office, which he said would continue the work his campaign’s field operation did to bring more New Yorkers into the political fold.\n\nRinged by supporters and passersby who stood several rows deep, phones in the air, to catch a glimpse of the new mayor, Mamdani then acknowledged the weight of the current moment.\n\n“We have an opportunity where New Yorkers are allowing themselves to believe in the possibility of city government once again,” he said. “That is not a belief that will sustain itself in the absence of action.”\n\nAlso on Mamdani’s to-do list: Moving to the mayor’s official residence, a stately mansion in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, before the lease on his Queens apartment ends later this month.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets will play their Week 18 finale versus the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\nIt'll represent the last showing for a defense that must undergo a serious identity makeover in the offseason. Head coach Aaron Glenn will hire a new defensive coordinator. General manager Darren Mougey will also be tasked with acquiring more talented playmakers on defense. They are heavily outmatched heading into Sunday.\n\nUntil then, we've identified three potential X-factors for the Jets defense in Week 18.\n\nJermaine Johnson II hasn't recorded a sack in his latest six appearances. It's been tough sledding for the pass rusher who returned from a 2024 season-ending torn Achilles injury. Johnson continues playing with effort, so it would be nice to see him finish the season with a breakthrough.\n\nInterim defensive coordinator Chris Harris recently heaped praise on linebacker Jamien Sherwood. Sherwood leads the Jets in tackles by a longshot with 147 takedowns this season. Despite it being a lost season, he continues to compete to his full capabilities.\n\nVeteran defensive tackle Harrison Phillips has been a limited participant at practice this week. That indicates he's trending towards being available for Sunday's finale. The Jets need Phillips' run-stopping efforts against Josh Allen and James Cook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: New York Jets vs. Buffalo Bills: 3 X-factors on defense for Week 18",

    "description": "With a playoff berth already guaranteed, the Buffalo Bills are playing for health and seeding this weekend.",
    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills are headed to the playoffs, extending their franchise-record streak to seven consecutive seasons. The New York Jets, on the other hand, are going to miss the playoffs for the 15th straight season. I won’t kick them while they’re down — we know better than any fan base what it feels like to miss the playoffs for an absurd amount of years — but it’s wild to think that the Jets have been as bad as they’ve been for as long as they have been.\n\nSunday’s game not only brings the regular season to a close, but it also brings Highmark Stadium’s tenure as home of the Buffalo Bills to an end, as well. Barring something strange where the Bills host the AFC Championship Game, Sunday’s contest will be the final game played in the stadium before the Bills open their brand new facility in September. Fittingly, it’s the Jets coming in on Sunday to close the stadium, as the Jets were also the first opponent for a regular-season game in the stadium way back in 1973.\n\nThat game was a real barn-burner, as the Bills beat the Jets by a final score of 9-7. John Leypoldt hit three field goals, O.J. Simpson rushed for 124 yards, and the Buffalo defense withstood an Al Woodall 36-yard touchdown pass to Jerome Barkum in the fourth quarter to hold on for a win. While we’d hope the game on Sunday will feature more excitement than the first meeting in this building between these two teams, it’s possible that the game takes on the form of a preseason game given its lack of meaning in the standings for both clubs.\n\nBuffalo cannot win the AFC East, so they’ll either be the five, six, or seven seed depending on Sunday’s slate of results. The Jets, meanwhile, win by losing, as they can clinch the No. 2 overall pick with a loss and a New York Giants win. They could also drop out of the top three choices with a win and losses from some other eliminated franchises.\n\nHow do we pick players to watch for a game where we’re not even sure who’s going to play? Well, we make it up as we go along. Our five Bills to watch this week are below, but feel free to share yours in the comments.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nYes, I heard head coach Sean McDermott when he said that this week would be “business as usual” with the starters. I also heard when he said that quarterback Josh Allen is “in a better place” with his foot injury this week than he was last week. I’ve also seen Allen log “DNPs” at practice on both Wednesday and Thursday, and then a limited session on Friday. Allen is going to start the game. He might even play a drive or two as the team tries to ensure that he scores 40 total touchdowns for a record sixth consecutive season.\n\nIt’s going to be Trubisky time at some point in the afternoon, though, so I’m watching mostly to see how quickly the clock strikes “Mitch” in this game. Individual statistics are fun, but healthy players in the playoffs are much more important. Playing Trubisky for the majority of this game is the right thing to do.\n\nSpeaking of guys who will likely play a bunch on Sunday, Buffalo’s kickoff returner extraordinaire is likely in line for plenty of carries on Sunday. Davis has just 37 rushing attempts this season, and he hasn’t had more than nine carries in a game. He’s hit that threshold three times, with the first of those times coming against these Jets in September. Davis ran nine times for 24 yards against the Jets in the first meeting.\n\nI expect that he’ll have right around that carry figure, if not more, with more yards gained and greater efficiency this time around. Would it be great for James Cook III to win the rushing title? Absolutely. Is it worth risking him turning an ankle heading into the playoffs? It absolutely is not. Davis should see the lion’s share of the snaps on Sunday.\n\nEff it. If Coleman is going to log a snap-count number greater than his jersey number at any point, this weekend is the time to do it. If I’m the Bills, I make Coleman active and force-feed him targets all day. What do they have to lose? At best, Coleman looks great, it gives him and the team confidence that he can help this postseason, and it spurs him onward to a great run in January and February.\n\nMaybe Coleman looks good enough where the team can point to this performance during the offseason as a reason for another club to trade for Coleman, just as they can point to another Class of 2024 wideout — Adonai Mitchell — across the field on Sunday as an example of the power of a change of scenery. At worst, Coleman plays and looks like a total non-factor in a game that ultimately means nothing, and the Bills have all the data they need to give up on their 2024 second-round choice.\n\nThe reward of playing Coleman in this game outweighs the risk, in my eyes. I’d let him roll and see what the kid can do.\n\nAnother deep cut! Center Conor McGovern has been dealing with injuries all season long, and he’s gutted through them admirably. At some point on Sunday, I’d love to see the Bills give McGovern a break and go to their second-year man. This serves two purposes: for starters, it gives McGovern some rest. Secondarily, it gives Van Pran-Granger some in-game experience heading into an offseason where McGovern, starting left guard David Edwards, and top interior reserve Alec Anderson are all free agents.\n\nDo the Bills think SVPG has what it takes to step into the starting lineup next season? Or will they need to commit big resources to keeping the band together up front? And, if so, which linemen do they retain? There are some big offseason questions to answer along the offensive line, but for now, resting McGovern would be a good move.\n\nMany of us have been clamoring for the rookie to see the field more this season. Well, kid, Sunday should be the day it happens. Jordan Poyer is already hurt and out for Sunday, so we’ll probably see more Darnell Savage this week. Cam Lewis started in Poyer’s place last week, but given his tremendous role on special teams and in dime packages, the team will likely limit his snaps, as well. Cole Bishop is entrenched as a starter, but it wouldn’t be the worst idea to let him play a little less this week.\n\nDo the Bills want to use Hancock as a safety? Or, will they slot him in — pun intended — for nickel corner Taron Johnson? Playing Hancock more this week would be a good move, as it would give the rookie some much-needed in-game experience while also resting some key veterans.",

    "description": "Ultrawealthy tech investors like David Sacks and Peter Thiel are weighing their options ahead of California's proposed billionaire wealth tax.",
    "fullText": "Is Miami destined to be the new Wall Street, and Austin the next Silicon Valley? \"All-in\" podcaster and White House AI czar David Sacks thinks so.\n\nSacks kicked off a New Year's social media debate by declaring that Miami will overtake New York as the nation's financial capital — and that Austin is poised to replace San Francisco as the center of tech.\n\n\"As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital,\" Sacks wrote in a January 1 post on X that ricocheted through tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from defenders of the old hubs.\n\nLinda Yaccarino, the former CEO of X, responded to Sacks with the word \"Miami\" along with a fire emoji.\n\nGarry Tan, who runs Y Combinator, the influential startup accelerator behind Airbnb, Stripe, and Dropbox, weighed in, saying the firm hasn't expanded beyond San Francisco because founders are still much more likely to build successful, product-market-fit unicorns in the region.\n\nWe haven’t done it yet because it is much more likely that people create successful PMF unicorns staying in SF Bay Area at a rate of 2.5x more\n\nNYC is about 2x\n\nTan recently said he would consider opening an Austin outpost if California moves forward with a proposed billionaire tax. The ballot measure would impose a one-time 5% levy on California residents with assets exceeding $1 billion and could go before voters in November if it qualifies.\n\nSacks urged Tan to reconsider, arguing that a Y Combinator outpost in Austin could become a \"self-fulfilling prophecy.\" \"If YC and others support Austin, it will be successful,\" Sacks said.\n\nMusk replied simply, \"Yes.\" The Pittsburgh-based venture capitalist Brandon Brooks said an Austin outpost \"would be the biggest shift for the startup ecosystem in history.\"\n\nSacks is a venture capitalist, podcaster, and one of the earliest members of the so-called \"PayPal mafia,\" a group of PayPal employees who went on to positions of influence and power in Silicon Valley. His profile surged after he was appointed the Trump administration's artificial intelligence and crypto czar.\n\nSacks' own firm is already on the move. Craft Ventures said it opened an Austin office in December, with Sacks relocating to the city while the firm maintains offices in New York and San Francisco. Fellow Texans including Elon Musk, Michael Dell, and Joe Lonsdale, one of the cofounders of Palantir, welcomed him with posts.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe argument Sacks is making isn't new (one online poster on X even replied with a popular \"Grand Theft Auto\" video game meme showing the character saying \"here we go again.\")\n\nThe debate flared during the pandemic, when remote work drove waves of coastal workers to Texas and Florida in search of more space, lower taxes, and a cheaper cost of living. Austin, in particular, ascended as companies like Tesla and Oracle moved into the region, and giants like Google and Facebook expanded their office footprints.\n\nSacks has also been making the case that high taxes, heavy regulation, and a leftward political turn are driving talent and capital out of legacy power centers like San Francisco and New York.\n\nSacks posted his prediction the same day Zohran Mamdani was inaugurated as New York City's mayor, making history as the first socialist mayor to hold the office.\n\nLonsdale's venture firm, 8VC, moved from San Francisco to Austin in 2020. Lonsdale tweeted at the time that the firm was moving for several reasons, among them: \"Austin is far more tolerant of ideological diversity than SF.\"\n\nThe hype hasn't fully held. Some tech workers told Business Insider they later left or tried to leave Austin, citing brutal heat, traffic, overcrowding, and a tech scene that felt thinner than advertised.\n\nMeanwhile, Thiel Capital is expanding in Miami as California's proposed wealth tax looms.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thiel Capital, the private investment firm founded by the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel said it has opened a new office in Miami.\n\nIf the proposal passes, the tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Good morning Gang Green Nation! The New York Jets will be on the road to face the Buffalo Bills in the last game of the regular season on Sunday. Josh Allen has not been practicing this week and is not expected to play on Sunday. For tank commanders that may cause some concern. Certainly the Jets’ chances of an upset improve with Allen out. However, the Bills still have a substantial edge at quarterback with Mitchell Trubisky under center compared to the Jets with Brady Cook under center. Unless the Bills play all their third string players and practice squad call-ups, they should still be handily favored at home. Even if that were to transpire, we should not underestimate how low this Jets team has sunk. An upset is always possible, but for now betting on the Jets to complete their tank on Sunday seems the safer bet.\n\nHere are your links to your New York Jets this glorious Friday in January:\n\nSusanna Weir – Jets-Bills Game Preview | Aiming to End 2025 Season on a High Note in Buffalo\n\nJack Bell – Jets DL Jowon Briggs: ‘You Can Be Selfish or Selfless’\n\nJohn Pullano – Stock Report 📈 | Punter Austin McNamara Looking to Finish Atop League in Key Category\n\nBrian Costello – Tanner Engstrand believes Jets offense has ‘good foundation’ in place despite brutal season\n\nNick Wojton – 2026 NFL draft: Where are the Jets’ Round 1 picks before Week 18?\n\nNick Wojton – Jets at Bills: 5 storylines to watch for during lead up to Week 18\n\nJustin Melo – 5 pending free agents who won’t return to the Jets defense in 2026\n\nNick Wojton – Jets handed poor update relating to 2026 NFL draft ahead of Week 18\n\nNick Wojton – Brady Cook named Jets’ starting QB for season finale, here’s why\n\nDharya Sharma – Jets 2026 mock draft: New York predicted to use pick from Sauce Gardner trade on SEC quarterback\n\nJustin Fried – Jets’ tank plans may have just gotten more complicated in Week 18\n\nJustin Fried – Jets’ intentions with Breece Hall are becoming clear as free agency nears\n\nJustin Fried – Every Jets player entering their final game under contract in Week 18\n\nHere are your missed connections from yesterday.",

    "fullText": "Mets get matter-of-fact update on Cody Bellinger in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCody Bellinger seems likely to spend 2026 in the Big Apple.\n\nThe New York Yankees are in the running to bring Bellinger back after a prodigious 2025 season.\n\nThe New York Mets appear the biggest threat to steal Bellinger away from the Bronx.\n\nMLB.com's Mark Feinsand reported as much in a new article on Thursday night. He sees these as the two ballclubs leading the pursuit of Bellinger.\n\n\"The Mets have been among the teams most often connected to Bellinger, and after trading Brandon Nimmo and Jeff McNeil, the need for an outfielder (or two) is clear,\" Feinsand writes. \"The two New York teams seem like the obvious fits for Bellinger, though the Angels, Blue Jays and Dodgers remain in the mix.\"\n\nMORE: Team USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nFeinsand also provided an update on the potential timeline for a Bellinger contract.\n\n\"Bellinger settled on a shorter-term deal the last time he hit the free-agent market, but with no qualifying offer attached to him as he enters his age-30 season, he’s likely to wait as long as he can until he finds the long-term deal that has evaded him,\" Feinsand wrote.\n\nThat could be a way for the Mets to differentiate themselves. If they come to the table with a longer-term deal for Bellinger, that could accelerate the wait time to getting a signature.\n\nNothing is a given. Bellinger may decide he doesn't want to leave Yankee Stadium. But if he wants to try somewhere new, Queens may hold the answer.\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nReds have a promising prospect named Ichiro Cano\n\nIt's a good day to remember Bob Feller's brilliance and his time in the U.S. Navy\n\nHow Aroldis Chapman is able to pitch for Great Britain in the WBC\n\nAlex Bregman has a key free agent preference\n\nYankees' pitcher leaving MLB to sign in Japan",

    "description": "New York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, tackles the housing crisis on day one with executive orders targeting landlords and bankruptcy case intervention.",
    "fullText": "Sworn in at midnight and again hours later publicly, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani used his first day in office Thursday to hit the ground running with new executive orders targeting city landlords and housing development. And he said the city will take what he called \"precedent-setting action\" to intervene in a private landlord bankruptcy case he said was tied to 93 buildings.\n\n\"Today is the start of a new era for New York City,\" Mamdani said. \"It is inauguration day. It is also the day that the rent is due.\"\n\nSpeaking at a Brooklyn apartment building, Mamdani framed the moves as an early test of whether city government will directly confront landlords over housing conditions and step into court cases that could determine whether tenants remain in their homes.\n\nMamdani said New Yorkers who attended his inauguration were returning to apartments where, he said, \"bad landlords do not make repairs,\" rents rise and residents deal with issues like cockroaches and a lack of heat.\n\nZohran Mamdani Will Be First Mayor To Be Sworn In On Quran During New York City Inauguration\n\nThe mayor said the new administration \"will not wait to deliver action\" and \"will stand up on behalf of the tenants of this city.\"\n\nMamdani announced three housing-related executive orders, starting with the revival of the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants, which he said will focus on resolving complaints and holding landlords accountable for hazardous conditions.\n\n\"We will make sure that 311 violations are resolved,\" Mamdani said, adding that the administration will hold \"slumlords\" accountable for \"hazardous and dangerous threats\" to tenant well-being.\n\nMamdani Taps Controversial Lawyer Who Defended Al Qaeda Terrorist For Top Role: 'Powerful Advocate'\n\nMamdani said the second executive order creates a LIFT task force, or a land-inventory effort designed to leverage city-owned land and accelerate housing development. He said the task force will review city-owned properties and identify sites suitable for housing development no later than July 1.\n\nThe third executive order creates a SPEED task force, which Mamdani said stands for Streamlining Procedures to Expedite Equitable Development. He said the task force will work to remove permitting barriers that slow housing construction.\n\nBoth task forces will be overseen by Deputy Mayor for Housing and Planning Lila Joseph, he said.\n\n\"These are sweeping measures, but it is just the beginning of a comprehensive effort to champion the cause of tenants,\" Mamdani said.\n\nFlashback: Inside The Political Movement That Put A Socialist In Charge Of New York City\n\nEarlier in the day, Mamdani signed executive order No. 1, which revoked all prior mayoral executive orders under former Mayor Eric Adams issued on or after Sept. 26, 2024, unless they were specifically reissued by Mamdani's administration.\n\nMamdani signed a second executive order setting the structure of his administration, including five deputy mayors and their oversight responsibilities.\n\nThe mayor made the announcement at 85 Clarkson Ave., a rent-stabilized building he said is owned by Pinnacle Realty, which he described as a \"notorious landlord.\"\n\nMamdani said tenants in the building have dealt with issues, including roaches and a lack of heat.\n\nMamdani said the building is one of 93 properties connect to the same landlord, and the portfolio is in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nMAMDANI PICKS EDUCATOR WHO WORKED TO DISMANTLE GIFTED & TALENTED PROGRAM AS NYC SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR\n\nThe mayor said the buildings will be auctioned to a different landlord he claimed ranks No. 6 on New York City’s worst landlord list, adding the buildings collectively have more than 5,000 open hazardous violations and 14,000 complaints.\n\n\"This is an untenable situation,\" Mamdani said. \"So, today we are announcing that we will be taking action in the bankruptcy case and stepping in to represent the interests of the city and the interests of the tenants.\"\n\nMamdani said he directed his nominee for corporation counsel, Steve Banks, to take what he called \"precedent-setting action\" in the case.\n\n\"We are a creditor and interested party,\" Mamdani said, adding that the city is owed money and will fight for \"safe and habitable homes\" while working to \"mitigate the significant risk of displacement\" that tenants face.\n\nA tenant speaker at the event described unsafe conditions in Pinnacle buildings and said a section of hardwood floor in the speaker’s mother’s apartment had remained unrepaired for seven years.\n\n\"When they filed for bankruptcy this spring, Pinnacle gambled on making our housing less affordable and our lives more miserable,\" the speaker said.\n\nThe mayor said the moves mark the start of a more aggressive use of executive power on housing issues, beginning on his first day in office.\n\nMamdani's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nOriginal article",

The mercury stood at a chilly 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14.4 degrees Celsius) at the 8 a.m. start of the parade.\n\nAcross the country, in New York City, hats and gloves were as necessary as noisemakers at the city's New Year's Eve ball drop, where temperatures near freezing appeared to be the coldest in 10 years.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people gather along the nearly six-mile (10-kilometer) route in Pasadena, where the two-hour parade kicked off. Millions more watch on national television. Organizers at the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, the group that organizes the parade ahead of the Rose Bowl college football game, said they made only small changes to accommodate the weather, such as the tops being up on convertibles carrying grand marshal Earvin “Magic” Johnson and other VIPs.\n\nRain forecasts for the Rose Parade, which had been dry for 20 years, grew all week. On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for all California counties and a coastal flood advisory through Sunday afternoon along much of the Pacific Coast near San Francisco.\n\nMeanwhile, residents in the areas hit hardest by last year's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires were under evacuation warnings.\n\nIn New York City, the sun came out ahead of Mayor Zohran Mamdani's inaugural celebration, but other areas of the Northeast and Midwest were hit by an Alberta clipper storm and trailing Arctic front that brought snow squalls and high winds.\n\nConditions varied widely — from snow showers to heavier squalls — from Wisconsin through northern Illinois and Michigan and into northern New Jersey, southeastern New York and New England.\n\nAbout a quarter of flights were delayed out of both San Diego International Airport and Boston Logan, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.",

    "fullText": "New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart closed out 2025 with unshakeable belief in a rapid turnaround, pointing to the team's talent and near-misses as proof that contention is close.\n\n\"No,\" Dart said when asked if the Giants are far from turning it around. \"I mean, we've got the pieces. This is not an excuse, but obviously, we've had a tough schedule, and we've been in really tight games where this season could completely flip. So that's kind of just the league. It's those one-score games and who can capitalize on those moments.\n\n\"We've got a lot of talent. We have some good vets, and we have a ton of young guys who are going to continue to thrive. I’ve said this a lot, we just have a ton of excitement for the future because we know what this thing can do and how we can flip this around.\"\n\nCentral to that vision is reuniting with star wide receiver Malik Nabers, sidelined for more than half the season with a torn ACL.\n\n\"We'll for sure continue to be together and light it up,\" Dart said. \"I'm excited. Those are conversations that we have a lot, and we're two of some of the younger guys in the entire league at 22, so we've got a long future together, and there's going to be a lot of great moments. I know that he's been attacking this recovery process, and he's going to come back stronger and better, and he's going to be hungry for sure.\"\n\nDart admitted Nabers' absence stung deeply.\n\n\"He’s an incredible talent. He could beat anybody in the world. When you have a guy like that out there, he's a safety guy who's going to come down with the ball at all costs,\" Dart said.\n\nWith a young core headlined by the Dart-Nabers connection, the quarterback sees winning -- and plenty of it -- on the horizon.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Jaxson Dart bullish on Giants' future, excited for Malik Nabers' return",

    "description": "Yasser Salem has built a business council to advise Mamdani if he wins. The McKinsey alum explains that bosses are open to free childcare.",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: This piece originally ran on November 4, 2025, ahead of Zohran Mamdani's electoral win. We are resharing the story on January 1, when he will be sworn in as mayor of New York City.\n\nIf you read the tabloids, the eve of a potential Zohran Mamdani mayorality has turned Billionaire's Row into 1975 Saigon, with everyone looking to hitch the last flight to Palm Beach.\n\nTo put it more bluntly, the city's wealthiest and most powerful business leaders have some qualms with Mamdani's socialist platform.\n\nHowever, the story is not so simple, says Yasser Salem, a former McKinsey executive building a business council to advise Mamdani if he wins the mayoral election. Sure, the word socialism can cause some tension, Salem, the head of OneNYC, a pro-Mamdani PAC, said, but there are some surprising areas of overlap.\n\nSome, like Jamie Dimon, have softened their message in public as they've gotten to know the candidate. Similarly, in conversations with more than 70 CEOs, Salem told Business Insider that some platform planks, such as universal childcare, are acceptable to many in the city's business community.\n\n\"Some of them have said from the beginning that they understand policies like free childcare as a way to lower the burden of worry, concern, and issues that their employees have that prevent them from being productive at work,\" Salem said. Others took more time, but the affordability crisis is unavoidable.\n\nAccording to a recent study of public data released by his PAC, the average New York family spends over 25% of its income on care for just one child. The group proposes several public-private models for childcare, including some where the costs are shared by the government and the employer — an idea, Salem said, that has \"widespread support.\"\n\nBusiness leaders' main concerns aren't surprising: Mamdani's public safety plans will make the city less safe, and housing proposals will exacerbate the city's housing crisis.\n\nHowever, even in housing, there are areas of agreement, Salem said.\n\nBusiness leaders criticized Mamdani's plan to freeze the rent for rent-stabilized apartments, arguing it would worsen shortages, noting that Mayor de Blasio had tried rent freezes that failed to address the long-term crisis.\n\nStill, both sides agree the long-term fix is boosting supply, Salem said.\n\nThe difference between the business community and Mamdani is in their time horizon. Mamdani's rent-freeze message could help lower rents now and satisfy voters, while his plans for zoning reform and building 200,000 \"truly-affordable\" apartments can solve the deeper problem over time.\n\n\"Are we solving for rent prices going down in four years? Are we solving for rent prices going down today?\" said Salem. \"Because if you're solving for rent prices going down today, supply is not going to do it.\"\n\nAs far as public safety, Salem said the announcement that Mamdani would seek to keep Jessica Tisch on as NYPD commissioner has helped alleviate fears that the city would become more dangerous under Mayor Mamdani.\n\nBusiness leaders also wanted to know how Mamdani's new Department of Community Safety, which would deploy civilian mental health responders to subway stations and to answer some emergency calls, would work.\n\n\"For example, a McDonald's owner in a tough neighborhood gets somebody coming in causing trouble,\" Salem said. \"Do they call 911 and get a mental health worker rather than a police officer?\"\n\nThe answer, Salem told Business Insider, is that these changes will be \"additive\" and that mental health workers will join \"alongside, not replacing the officers on the scene.\"\n\nSurprisingly, he said, taxes don't come up as a big fear. CEOs told them they're willing to pay more if they \"feel that New York is a better place to live as a result.\"\n\nThe announcement that Tisch was staying on helped alleviate some of the more intangible fears of the city's business elite, too, said Salem, such as Mamdani's inexperience or his ideological commitments to socialism, or to the pro-Palestine cause.\n\nAnd Salem, who doesn't consider himself a socialist but instead a \"pro-responsible capitalist,\" also said that he would try to get CEOs to focus on their specific disagreements with Mamdani's policies, rather than focusing on \"labels\" like socialism.\n\nSalem tells CEOs that Mamdani is looking to expand the social safety net, not expropriate their wealth.\"He's not saying we're going to go from the corporate tax rate being 25% to being 75%,\" Salem said.",

    "description": "A New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.",
    "fullText": "United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addresses a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025 \n\nA New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart during which he seemed much more concerned with his appearance than policy.\n\nThe Times published a comprehensive story about the Trump administration’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday in which it suggested that Hegseth began his tenure at the Pentagon “as something of a blank slate on the war.”\n\n“He didn’t have any of his own thoughts on Russia and Ukraine,” an ex-Pentagon official told the Gray Lady. “But he had civilian advisers who did.”\n\nOn Day 4, the freshly minted defense secretary sat at a Pentagon conference table as one of his coterie of advisers argued for an immediate U-turn.\n\nThe ideological godfather of the group was Elbridge A. Colby, grandson of the Nixon-era C.I.A. director William E. Colby. The younger Mr. Colby and Mr. Vance had been introduced in 2015 by an editor at National Review who thought they were like-minded. Nearly nine years later, as Mr. Biden poured billions of dollars into arming Ukraine, Mr. Colby argued that “we would have been better served to put a lot more of that money to use in the Pacific.”\n\nNow, it was one of his disciples, Dan Caldwell, presenting the group’s recommendations to Mr. Hegseth, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other military leaders.\n\nThe Pentagon, Mr. Caldwell argued, should pause delivery of certain munitions that the Biden administration had promised to Ukraine, because, he believed, existing stocks were insufficient to execute America’s war plans around the world. Nor should it use the additional $3.8 billion left unspent by the Biden administration to buy weapons for Ukraine.\n\nGeneral Brown did not speak as Mr. Caldwell wrapped up. He simply shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\n\nDuring a trip to Europe the next month, Hegseth reportedly made sure to powder his nose for the cameras, but declined to answer Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov’s queries:\n\nThe Ukrainians had repeatedly requested a proper sit-down. Instead it would be a brief stand-up affair in an anteroom.\n\nBeforehand, according to an American official present, Mr. Hegseth dabbed his nose with powder from a small compact. “Look commanding,” he told one aide. The handshake with the Ukrainian might be shown on Fox; the president might be watching.\n\nThen the standing meeting began, Mr. Umerov coming in close, taking his voice down to a whisper, assuring the secretary that he knew America’s political and security agenda might be changing. He didn’t ask for new aid. He just needed to know one thing: Would the U.S. military continue to supply the munitions Ukraine was counting on, the ones approved by Mr. Biden? Every delivery sustained the lives of Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines; every delivery that didn’t arrive one day meant those soldiers would die the next.\n\nAgain and again, Mr. Umerov repeated his plea: “I just need you to be honest with me. Just be honest with me.”\n\nHegseth allegedly offered Umerov only nodding.\n\n“He wasn’t pleading for the answer that he wanted, but just for honesty, some indication,” observed one U.S. official. “He was saying: You can trust me; you can trust us. Just tell me what you guys are thinking.”\n\nThe post New York Times Deep Dive Alleges Pete Hegseth Donned Makeup for Ukraine Photo Op — Then Ignored Counterpart first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — CAPITALS 6, RANGERS 3\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Tom Wilson had two goals and an assist to lead Washington past New York.\n\nWilson, who earlier in the day was named a member of Canada’s Olympic roster, got into a fight with Sam Carrick in the second period for at least his second Gordie Howe hat trick — a goal, an assist and a fight — since March 3, 2025.\n\nJustin Sourdif also had two goals and Anthony Beauvillier and Aliaksei Protas each scored for the Capitals, who have won two of the last three games.\n\nAdam Fox, making his return from long-term injured reserve, had a goal and an assist for the Rangers, who have lost three straight. Vincent Trocheck and Braden Schneider also scored.\n\nWith the Capitals tied 1-1 and needing a spark in the second, Wilson rose to the occasion. The 28-year-old came streaking up ice and leveled Noah Laba before getting to the front of the net and roofing a feed from Connor McMichael to restore Washington’s lead as he became the first Capital to hit the 20-goal mark this season. Minutes later, he answered for Laba’s hit, fighting Carrick.\n\nThe fight, initiated by Carrick, put the Capitals on the power play. Sourdif snuck a loose puck past Jonathan Quick, who had 21 saves, to end a 16-game goal drought to make it 3-1.\n\nFox responded with a power-play goal of his own soon after to pull things to 3-2 going into the third.\n\nProtas and Wilson, netting his 200th career goal, added insurance tallies late to cushion the lead.\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) — Steven Stamkos scored his 600th career goal and Nashville beat the Vegas.\n\nThe Predators, in the middle of a season-long seven-game road trip, won for the 12th time in 17 games, including the third of their first four on the trip.\n\nThe win put the Predators (18-17-4) above .500 for the first time since Oct. 16, just five games into the season, when they were 2-1-2.\n\nVegas, meanwhile, lost for the sixth time in seven games. The Knights closed their four-game homestand with a 1-2-1 mark.\n\nNow in his 18th season, Stamkos scored his 18th of the season and ninth against the Golden Knights since they entered the league in 2017. The game-tying goal was part of an unanswered three-goal spurt over five minutes that turned a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 lead for the Predators.\n\nNick Perbix, Reid Schaefer and Michael Bunting also scored for the Predators. Justus Annunen made 29 saves.\n\nFormer Knight Erik Haula, who is two games shy of skating in his 800th game, registered the 200th assist of his career on Bunting’s goal.\n\nMark Stone, who earlier in the day was named to Canada’s Olympic roster, scored his 10th goal of the season, while Ben Hutton added his sixth for the Knights. Akira Schmid stopped 15 shots before being pulled late in the third period for an extra skater.\n\nVegas forward Mitch Marner and defenseman Shea Theodore were also named to Canada’s team. All three of the Knights represented their homeland in the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off.\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Darren Raddysh scored midway through overtime, and Tampa Bay blew three one-goal leads before beating Anaheim for its fifth consecutive victory.\n\nTampa Bay coach Jon Cooper celebrated his 1,000th regular-season game in charge with his 595th victory as the longest-tenured bench boss in the NHL. The Lightning’s coach since March 2013 has also led them in 155 playoff games, won two championships and reached four Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nNikita Kucherov had a goal and an assist as the Lightning skated off with a win in the opener of their three-game California road trip when Raddysh converted a pass from Brandon Hagel, who had three assists.\n\nJ.J. Moser and Brayden Point also scored for Tampa Bay, and Andrei Vasilevskiy made 24 saves.\n\nMason McTavish tied it on a power play with 6:58 left in regulation for the Ducks, who have lost four straight and eight of 10. Jansen Harkins and Beckett Sennecke also scored, and Lukas Dostal stopped 24 shots as the Ducks earned a point for only the second time in six games.\n\nMoser opened the scoring in the first period with his first goal since agreeing to an eight-year, $54 million contract extension last weekend.\n\nAnaheim scored its first two goals off turnovers, with the 19-year-old Sennecke getting the 12th of his rookie season early in the third period.\n\nKucherov scored his 18th goal on a cross-ice pass from Hagel during a power play four minutes later, but the Ducks evened it again when Pavel Mintyukov made an exceptional play at the blue line to set up McTavish for his 10th goal.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Macklin Celebrini had a goal and an assist hours after being selected to play for Team Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics, and San Jose beat Minnesota in a shootout.\n\nCelebrini and William Eklund scored for the Sharks in the tiebreaker, while Minnesota failed to convert on either of its two attempts. San Jose has won three straight following a three-game slide.\n\nIgor Chernyshov had a goal and two assists, and Jeff Skinner also scored for the Sharks. The 19-year-old Celebrini got his 40th assist of the season, passing Mikko Rantanen for second-most in the NHL. Yaroslav Askarov finished with 20 saves.",

    "description": "If the Boston Cetics want to win the Eastern Conference, they will probably have to go through the Knicks",
    "fullText": "Heading into the 2025-26 NBA season, the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers were consensus favorites in the Eastern Conference. With two months of the season in the history books, the Cavaliers no longer appear to be a viable threat, and the Knicks are still coming to grips with Mike Brown's movement-heavy system.\n\nHowever, New York still has all the tools it needs to be a serious playoff contender. As such, if the Celtics do embark on a deep playoff run, they may find themselves facing off against the Knicks for the second straight season. Even though Boston is playing some inspired basketball, New York would undoubtedly have the talent advantage at almost every position.\n\nStill, the Celtics have been outperforming expectations and have proven that a never-say-die attitude can work wonders. That's why the \"First To The Floor\" podcast recently spent some time discussing how much of a threat the Knicks are to the Celtics' chances of postseason success this season, and whether New York should fear a potential trap series against Joe Mazzulla's team.\n\nYou can watch the full podcast episode by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: The Knicks may need to fear the Celtics",

    "description": "Miami, Seattle, and Dallas are shaping the new creator economy landscape as influencers spread out from LA and NY.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood remains the world's entertainment nexus, but many next-gen creators have decided they don't need a Los Angeles address to make it big.\n\nMiami, Las Vegas, and Seattle all attract more top Instagram influencers per capita than LA, according to new research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm.\n\nThe top two by total creator count were LA (over 12,000) and New York (nearly 11,000), followed by Miami (about 6,000).\n\nOther major creator communities have formed in established film markets, such as Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas, which have emerged due to their lower cost of living and production tax incentives. But other top creator cities — Seattle, Las Vegas, Philadelphia — lie outside those secondary film markets.\n\nThe ability to create content for social platforms from anywhere means creators can build a livelihood from just about anywhere. Talent managers say that, apart from when they want a creator to attend an in-person event, brands rarely request a city-specific creator when seeking a partner.\n\n\"You do have people in LA and New York making the lion's share of the dollars. But now they're increasing everywhere else,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. \"Eventually, there will be a hot influencer in Idaho.\"\n\nLooking at cities by concentration of creators, Miami comes in No. 1, outranking LA and NYC.\n\nSome creators are drawn to places that already have a robust creative community, like Nashville or Las Vegas. Others want to be near fashion and retail, which fuels a lot of the creator economy. LTK, a major e-commerce platform that connects influencers to shoppers, is based in Dallas, as was Neiman Marcus for a long time. Dude Perfect, a superstar creator group known for sports-focused stunt videos, is based in nearby Frisco. Miami, where Alix Earle gained social media fame and often appears, experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes.\n\nCreators also move to be near family and for a lower cost of living. It makes sense for people building a brand based on themselves to work in areas that reflect their identity. The biggest YouTuber by subscriber count, Jimmy Donaldson, a.k.a. MrBeast, chose his hometown of Greenville, NC, as his base.\n\nDude Perfect has recently embarked on a major expansion in Texas. CEO Andrew Yaffe said there's no need to be in LA with access to top brands and talent there.\n\n\"We'll be here as far in the future as we can see,\" he previously told Business Insider. \"There's no shortage of opportunity for us here.\"\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.",
