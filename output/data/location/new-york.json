PepsiCo said it will use the savings to invest in marketing and improved value for consumers.

    "fullText": "Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, Ohio State QB Julian Sayin, Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love are headed to New York City for the Heisman Trophy presentation.\n\nHere’s a look at all four players through the recruiting process:\n\nAn industry three-star quarterback, Mendoza was originally committed to Yale but got a late offer from Cal and took it. The Miami (Fla.) Columbus prospect didn’t have an exceptional senior year of high school, either, throwing for just about 1,100 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nHe redshirted in Berkeley in 2022 and was the backup for the first half of the 2023 season until getting his first opportunity in Week 6 against Oregon State and never looking back.\n\nAfter throwing for 3,000 yards and 16 touchdowns in 2024, Mendoza hit the transfer portal and has starred at Indiana this season leading the Hoosiers to an undefeated regular season and then beating Ohio State in the Big 10 championship.\n\nIf Justyn Martin from Inglewood, Calif., did not de-commit from the Golden Bears in late September, one wonders if Mendoza would have ever been offered by Cal at all – and whether Yale would have had a Heisman frontrunner on its hands.\n\nRated as the second-best quarterback behind only Florida’s DJ Lagway as a five-star prospect, Sayin committed to Alabama over Georgia and LSU as Michigan, Notre Dame and others were involved earlier but the Carlsbad, Calif., standout shied away from playing in the cold weather.\n\nPlaying for coach Nick Saban – and offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien – were huge draws for Sayin to pick the Crimson Tide but a few short weeks after arriving in Tuscaloosa, Saban retired and O’Brien left for Boston College.\n\nThen-Washington coach Kalen DeBoer got the Alabama job and according to the book The Price: What it Takes to Win in College Football’s Era of Chaos, the new Crimson Tide coach made Sayin wait to meet him and then acted like he didn’t know who he was during the short meeting.\n\nThe former five-star transferred to Ohio State, sat behind Will Howard last season as the Buckeyes won the national championship and then Sayin won the starting job leading Ohio State to the No. 2 overall ranking in the College Football Playoff.\n\nSo far this season, Sayin has thrown for 3,323 yards with 31 touchdowns and six interceptions.\n\nA three-star junior college prospect at New Mexico Military Institute, Pavia then transferred to New Mexico State where in 2023 he led the Aggies to a shocking 31-10 win at Auburn and emerged as one of the hottest quarterbacks in the transfer portal after that season.\n\nAfter two seasons at New Mexico State, Pavia has now spent two seasons at Vanderbilt and the Commodores at 10-2 have their first double-digit winning season in program history dating back to 1902.\n\nPavia in many ways has taken the college football world by storm over the last two years and he also had at least a part – either by publicly talking about him or showing what Vanderbilt football is capable of – of landing five-star quarterback Jared Curtis, who flipped from Georgia around National Signing Day.\n\nHe’s thrown for 2,924 yards with 26 touchdowns and six picks this season and also leads the Commodores with 661 rushing yards and eight TDs.\n\nRanked as the fifth-best running back in the 2023 class, Love chose Notre Dame over Alabama, Michigan, Texas A&M, Oregon and others midway through his senior season.\n\nAt the time of his pledge, the Irish also had running back pledges from Dylan Edwards, who has had a wild recruitment and college career of changing schools, along with Jayden Limar.\n\nThe Christian Brothers standout was the second St. Louis standout who was in that Notre Dame class along with four-star DB Christian Gray who played at De Smet.\n\nLove has rushed for more than 1,000 yards in each of the last two seasons and would be the first running back to win the Heisman Trophy since Derrick Henry in 2015. The former four-star has rushed for 1,372 yards and 18 touchdowns this season and those will be his final stats since the Irish turned down a bowl game bid.",

    "title": "A Rivian spin-off is betting $305 million on e-bikes. I rode it around New York City, and it felt natural — and powerful.",
    "description": "I use my steel Fuji road bike for everything. So when I heard about a new e-bike from Rivian spin-off Also, I couldn't resist trying it out.",
    "fullText": "Many Americans view cars as a necessity. But for me, and millions of other people, bikes are how we get where we need to go.\n\nMy steel Fuji road bike is like another limb. I use it to get to work, grab groceries, and pedal to see my friends. I can haul it onto the subway if I get tired, or if the weather takes a surprise turn for the worse. It's cheap to maintain, and I can use it in place of a gym membership.\n\nIn New York City, where I live, e-bikes — the road bike's zoomier cousin — are everywhere. They're not just popular with the 135,000 members of Citibike, our city's bike-share program; businesses have also embraced them. Many delivery workers use e-bikes to avoid our city's awful traffic snarls, and giants like Amazon use them to drop off packages and reduce emissions.\n\nSo when one of my colleagues told me they'd been getting emails from Also, a new e-bike company, I couldn't resist hopping in the saddle. I've been thinking about buying an e-bike, and the emails said Also's bike, the TM-B, had some unique features. The fact that it had been spun out of Rivian, a $21 billion electric vehicle company, intrigued me.\n\nRivian has retained a minority stake in Also — as in, \"you can drive a car, and you can also ride a bike.\" Also uses the same battery cells as Rivian's autos, and takes inspiration from the carmaker's drive for simplicity. While many e-bikes are manufactured by traditional bike makers, Also sticks exclusively with electric-powered products. It has raised $305 million, according to Pitchbook.\n\nJust before Thanksgiving, I met up with Saul Leiken, Also's director of product, to learn about the new $4,500 TM-B and take it for a spin around Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood.\n\nI came away surprised at how flexible it was, and thinking it could be a good add-on — or primary method of transportation — for many households across the US.\n\nAll e-bikes are complex pieces of machinery compared to normal bikes. In pedal-assist modes — when the motor only kicks in when you turn the pedals — the bike needs some way to process and interpret how hard you're pedaling to decide how much to help you. Those sensors need to be able to \"talk\" to the motor.\n\nThe TM-B, which stands for \"Transcendant Mobility Bike,\" operates on an entirely different level from your typical e-bike. The pedals don't connect to a chain; they power a generator and provide input to a computer system that tells the motor how much juice to give the bike, a system the company calls \"DreamRide.\" If there are updates, they'll be delivered over-the-air, like with your smartphone — or, increasingly, your car.\n\n\"Everything's software-defined,\" said Leiken, who also joined me on a test ride.\n\nIt struck me how digitized everyday transportation is becoming. Even gas-burning cars don't have direct, mechanical links between the steering wheel and the wheels or even the gas pedal and the engine. It's all digital, or \"drive by wire.\" That makes the TM-B \"pedal by wire.\"\n\nI started out riding the TM-B in \"All Purpose\" mode. I relied on pedal assist, and I changed the levels by tapping a small screen at the top of the bike's head tube. It didn't feel like I was giving instructions to a computer; it felt like I was pedaling.\n\nThe part of Manhattan we were riding in was pretty flat, and it was a somewhat chilly day. Even if I'd been using a normal bike, I probably would not have broken a sweat. But the assist from the DreamRide would be welcome on a warmer day, and I could see it propelling me over the Manhattan Bridge if I wanted to get to Brooklyn without much effort.\n\nLater on, we tried the TM-B's \"Sport\" mode, which approximates the experience of a standard, geared bicycle. There's no chain to clank around to let you know you've switched gears, but there is haptic feedback, just like on your smartphone, that courses through the pedals.\n\nState and local e-bike regulations are evolving, but in most states, there are three classes of e-bike, and the TM-B is what's called a \"Class 3\" e-bike, capable of hitting speeds up to 28 miles per hour. That's about as fast as a car will ever go in most places in New York City, except for a highway or a boulevard in one of the outer boroughs — in the middle of the night.\n\nI inched toward that top speed at a couple of points during our 30-minute ride. Once, early on, I cranked the pedal-assist level to its max. I was only going in the mid-20s, but still beating traffic because bikes are simply more nimble than cars, until we hit a red light.\n\nLater, when we were going west along a large block, I remembered to hit the throttle — a little orange button near my right thumb designed to take me up to 20 miles per hour.\n\nIt gave me a real rush; it felt almost like riding a motorbike, which I hadn't done in years. At the same time, I knew I had to be attentive, for my own safety and that of others.\n\nNationwide, estimated e-bike sales are between 1 million and 2 million a year. It's hard to be precise, partly because the market has so many players, and partly because customs data is incomplete and lumps e-bikes into a larger category of imports, according to eCycle Electric, a consulting firm. What's clear is that it's growing: eCycle predicts that sales will grow 14% to 25% per year until 2030.\n\nSome e-bike companies have run into trouble. Recently, Techcrunch reported that Rad Power Bikes, which says it has 680,000 customers, could run out of money by January 2026. VanMoof, a Dutch e-bike brand whose sleek rides stood apart from competitors with chunky batteries and conspicuous wiring, went bankrupt in 2023, and its new owners are trying to reestablish themselves.\n\nWhen I asked Leiken about this, he said Also's timing was better — some e-bike companies built too much during the pandemic and were desperate to unload inventory afterward — and its business model is less reliant on partners. The bike's adaptability struck me as a potential selling point, too: It can ride on roads, rutted streets, and trails, and can be used for a workout or a quick errand.\n\nSome things about the bike weren't final. The bell is digital, emitted by a speaker, and Leiken told me they were considering tweaking the tone and modifying it so that, if you hit it hard, it would sound like a car horn. It reminded me of how electric car manufacturers have created custom sounds to alert pedestrians at low speeds, as required by federal regulations.\n\nAlso has also rolled out a helmet, called the Alpha Wave. It has built-in front and rear lights meant to catch drivers' attention, speakers, and a noise-cancelling mic. While simple bike helmets provide some degree of protection in case of a collision, Also's helmet has a new technology called the Release Layer System that's meant to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury.\n\nThere's a learning curve to bike ownership, and Also seems focused on flattening that curve.\n\nWhile I didn't have the controls down pat in a roughly 30-minute ride, I felt completely safe the whole time, and I'm sure I would've gotten the hang of it in another hour. For a novice rider, it might take longer, and it would be smart to start in a park or a parking lot before mixing with traffic.\n\nOne of the more intriguing aspects of the bike was its swappable \"top frames.\" With a couple of taps, you can replace the seat with one for a much larger or much smaller rider. You can also swap in a roomier bench seat, or a seat with a utility rack to schlep cargo or a kid. It slots in like a ski boot, with a mechanical lock and an electrical connection to power the back lights on the bike. I'm not aware of any e-bikes with a similar feature.\n\nThe point of the TM-B wasn't just to create a fun ride, Leiken said. It was to further the idea of \"bikes as transportation\" — as something that can actually replace a car for local trips. While $3,500 is nothing to sneeze at, Leiken said the company wanted to bring a \"super-premium feature set and experience\" to riders. He said bikes with similar features are usually more like $8,000. Besides, a used car will set you back $25,000 on average, and an average new car is $50,000.\n\nI've long thought that e-bikes are generally good to have in society, and that they could replace a great deal of car trips. I've occasionally mulled buying one, but I feel like, as a fit person in my 30s, it might be overkill.\n\nThe TM-B didn't radically change my mind. I'm still undecided on buying an e-bike — I really love my Fuji road bike — but it could be good for someone who wants an e-bike that can do it all. It's a flexible workhorse, and given how pricey cars are getting, I think a lot of people could justify the price tag.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Moments after Luigi Mangione was handcuffed at a Pennsylvania McDonald’s, a police officer searching his backpack found a loaded gun magazine wrapped in a pair of underwear.\n\nThe discovery, recounted in court Monday as Mangione fights to keep evidence out of his New York murder case, convinced police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, that he was the man wanted in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan five days earlier.\n\n“It's him, dude. It's him, 100%,” an officer was heard saying on body-worn camera video from Mangione’s Dec. 9, 2024 arrest, punctuating the remark with expletives as the officer combing the bag, Christy Wasser, held up the magazine.\n\nWasser, a 19-year Altoona police veteran, testified on the fourth day of a pretrial hearing as Mangione sought to bar prosecutors from using the magazine and other evidence against him, including a 9 mm handgun and a notebook found during a subsequent bag search.\n\nThe testimony shed light on the critical minutes after Mangione was spotted at the McDonald’s and the sometimes unusual steps police officers took in collecting evidence critical to tying him to the crime.\n\nWhy the defense says the evidence shouldn't be used at trial\n\nMangione’s lawyers argue the items should be excluded because police didn’t have a search warrant and lacked the grounds to justify a warrantless search. Prosecutors contend the search was legal and that police eventually obtained a warrant.\n\nWasser, testifying in full uniform, said Altoona police protocols require promptly searching a suspect’s property at the time of an arrest, in part for dangerous items.\n\nOn body-worn camera video played in court, Wasser was heard saying she wanted to check the bag for bombs before removing it from the McDonald’s. Despite that concern, she acknowledged in her testimony Monday that police never cleared the restaurant of customers or employees.\n\nMangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. He appeared in good health on Monday, pumping his fist for photographers and chatting with his lawyers as testimony resumed.\n\nThe hearing, which was postponed Friday because of Mangione’s apparent illness, applies only to the state case. His lawyers are making a similar push to exclude the evidence from his federal case, where prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.\n\nWhy prosecutors say jurors should be able to see the evidence\n\nProsecutors have said the handgun found in the backpack matches the firearm used in the killing and that writings in the notebook showed Mangione’s disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference.\n\nThompson, 50, was killed as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for his company’s investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.\n\nMangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west of Manhattan, after police there received a 911 call about a McDonald’s customer resembling the suspect.\n\nWasser testified that she went to the McDonald’s on her own to assist another officer, Joseph Detwiler. Before that, she said, she had seen some coverage of Thompson’s killing on Fox News, including the surveillance video of the shooting and images of the suspected shooter.\n\nWasser began searching Mangione’s bag as officers took him into custody on initial charges of forgery and false identification, after he acknowledged giving them a bogus driving license, police said. The same fake name was used by the alleged gunman used at a Manhattan hostel days before the shooting.\n\nWasser told another officer she wanted to check the bag for a bomb before leaving the McDonald’s because she didn’t want to repeat an incident in which another Altoona officer had inadvertently brought a bomb to the police station.\n\nWhat did police find in Mangione's bag?\n\n“Did you call the bomb squad?” Mangione lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo asked.\n\n“No. I didn’t find a bomb yet,” Wasser responded.\n\nAccording to body-worn camera video, the first few items Wasser found were innocuous: a hoagie, a loaf of bread and a smaller bag containing a passport, cellphone and computer chip.\n\nThen she pulled out a gray pair of underwear, unwrapping them to reveal the magazine.\n\nSatisfied there was no bomb, she suspended her search and placed some of the items back in the bag. Some evidence, including Mangione’s laptop computer, was transported to the police station in a brown paper McDonald’s takeout bag, body-worn camera video showed.\n\nWasser resumed her search after an 11-minute drive to the police station and almost immediately found the gun and silencer — the latter discovery prompting her to laugh and exclaim “nice,” according to body-worn camera footage. Wasser said the gun was in a side pocket that she hadn't searched at McDonald’s.\n\nLater, while cataloging everything in the bag in what's known as an inventory search, she found the notebook and other notes, including what appeared to to-do lists and possible getaway plans.\n\n“Isn't it awesome?” Wasser said at one point during the search, according to the body-worn camera video.\n\nAsked to explain, she told Friedman Agnifilo on Monday that she was proud of her police department’s work in helping to capture Thompson’s suspected killer.\n\nA Blair County, Pennsylvania, prosecutor testified that a judge later signed off on a search warrant for the bag, a few hours after the searches were completed. The warrant, she said, provided a legal mechanism for Altoona police to turn the evidence over to New York City detectives investigating Thompson’s killing.\n\nAs he has throughout the case, Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann described Thompson’s killing as an “execution” and referred to his notebook as a “manifesto” — terms that Mangione’s lawyers said were prejudicial and inappropriate.\n\nJudge Gregory Carro said the wording had “no bearing” on him, but warned Seidemann that he’s “certainly not going to do that at trial” when jurors are present.",

    "fullText": "The first two officers arriving at the McDonald's on December 9, 2024 — the fifth day of the nationwide manhunt — had not been expecting much.\n\nNo one believed Thompson's shooter would be in the restaurant — not the two cops, not their supervisor, not even the store manager who'd reluctantly called 911 at their customers' insistence. The call had been dispatched as \"Priority: Low.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\" one of the officers asked, approaching Mangione at the back of the restaurant. \"Uh, Mark,\" Mangione answered, according to sealed police bodycam footage shown in court. He told them he was homeless.\n\nHe then handed over this New Jersey license — listing his name as \"Mark Rosario.\"\n\nMangione was then asked to pull down his blue-and-white paper medical mask, which Altoona patrolman Joseph Detwiler said made Mangioni stand out.\n\n\"We don't wear masks,\" Detwiler told the jury. \"We have antibodies.\"\n\nWhen Mangione's mask was lowered, everything changed. \"I knew it was him immediately,\" testified Detwiler. \"I stayed calm.\"\n\nBodycam footage showed the officer whistling along as Jingle Bell Rock played on the McDonald's sound system — to keep Mangione calm as well, as they ran his license, he told the judge.\n\nDetwiler had closely followed the manhunt for Thompson's killer, the veteran patrolman told New York Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro from the witness stand.\n\nHe'd said he'd seen NYPD social media postings publicizing the as-yet-unnamed shooting suspect's face. Elsewhere online, he had seen surveillance footage of the shooting, which was played in court.\n\n\"I knew in New York that they hadn't found the firearm,\" Detwiler testified. Safety, he explained, was behind the decision to frisk Mangione and search his backpack before arresting him on the initial Pennsylvania charges of forgery and providing a false ID to law enforcement.\n\nOnce at the Altoona Police station, a more thorough search of Mangione's backpack, pockets, clothing, and other belongings was conducted. Officers found this folded scrap of lined paper, filled with writing and diagrams in pencil.\n\nPart doodled map, part to-do list, it is filled with dates and tasks, only some of which were accomplished. Under \"12/8,\" the words \"Best buy\" had been crossed off, as were mentions of a USB drive, \"digital cam,\" and \"light source.\"\n\n\"Hot meal\" and \"water bottles\" were also crossed off.\n\nOther items on the list — including \"AAA bats\" and \"survival kit,\" under the date 12/9, the day of his arrest — were not crossed out.\n\nAt the Altoona police station, cops recovered $7,800 in large bills and currency from Thailand, Japan, and India, totaling $1,620, from Mangioni's backpack. \n\n\"There's a weapon,\" Patrolwoman Christy Wasser is heard saying soon after, in footage showing her continuing to search Mangione's backpack.\n\nGiven the gun and the at-first-overlooked knife, the decision was made to strip-search Mangione.",
