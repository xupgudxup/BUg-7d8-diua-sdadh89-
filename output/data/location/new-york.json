    "fullText": "It wasn’t pretty, but the New York Rangers came away with a 2-1 win over the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night.\n\nGoing into this matchup, the Rangers had lost two consecutive games while only scoring one goal in the process.\n\nMike Sullivan’s response was to call up Gabe Perreault and Brennan Othmann from the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League, who both slotted into the lineup.\n\nDespite a strong first period where the Rangers led 10-5 in shots and dominated possession time for the most part, an offensive zone turnover led to a goal from Jonatan Berggren, putting the Blueshirts in an early 1-0 hole.\n\nThe Rangers came out aggressive in the second period, and on the power play, Will Cuylle took a shot that deflected off of Perreault’s foot for his first career NHL goal.\n\n“I kind of blacked out,” Perreault said about his goal. “Pretty lucky one, but feels good to get the first one.”\n\nAfter 40 minutes, the Rangers held a 25-15 edge in shots and felt they were outplaying the Blues.\n\n“I thought for the first two periods, we did a really good job,” Sullivan said. “I thought we were playing on top of them. We established a lot of offensive zone time.”\n\nThe Rangers’ game began to falter in the third period.\n\nSt. Louis began dictating the pace of play, creating multiple high-quality scoring chances, which put the Rangers on their heels for the majority of the final frame.\n\nIt was the heroics of Igor Shesterkin that helped the Rangers escape into overtime. Shesterkin made 11 critical saves down the stretch, and when the Blueshirts broke down defensively, their superstar goalie was there to bail them out.\n\n“It’s great,” J.T. Miller said of having Igor Shesterkin in net. “We talk about it all the time, it’s such a luxury to have. Even when it’s Quick in there, we are so lucky to have those guys, and obviously total confidence in them. It was on display again tonight.”\n\nShesterkin made 26 saves on the night, and his performance left Blues head coach Jim Montgomery nothing but impressed.\n\n\"Shesterkin's an elite goaltender in this league,” Montgomery said. “He showed that tonight.”\n\nIn overtime, Miller buried the game-winning goal to propel the Rangers to a hard-fought victory.\n\nMiller has recorded three overtime goals this season, joining Tomas Sandstrom, Adam Graves, and Marian Gaborik as the only Rangers players to accomplish this feat.\n\n“It's good for the confidence,” Miller said of his three overtime goals. “Last couple weeks, I feel like my games there. I don't think it's kind of back to the same as the beginning of the year. It's like not getting as much as I'd like, I think, on the scoresheet. But I got to believe that if you just play like that most games than not over the course of the season, good things will happen. Just try to be confident.”\n\nAdam Fox Returns To Practice For The First Time Since Suffering Injury It appears as if Adam Fox is making strides in his recovery from an upper-body injury.&nbsp;\n\nWhile this performance certainly wasn’t anything to write home about, Sullivan was pleased with the way his team played, specifically from the standpoint of playing with the right intentions in the offensive zone.\n\n“I thought our intentions as far as getting to the net front, getting inside a little bit more was better tonight,” Sullivan emphasized. “I thought we had more looks just by getting inside and trying to create off the shot. I do think the guys are listening in that regard, just trying to create more off the shot.”\n\nThe Rangers will be back in action on Saturday afternoon against the Philadelphia Flyers.",

    "description": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game.",
    "fullText": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game on April 15, as he announced on SI Media with Jimmy Traina. This marks Buck’s second consecutive year being part of ESPN’s first broadcast.\n\nDespite ESPN and Major League Baseball reaching a deal to air 30 regular-season games, Buck is only scheduled to call the Dodgers-Mets game. Last season marked the first time Buck called a nationally broadcasted baseball game since 2021, after leaving Fox for ESPN.\n\nIn 2022, Buck and Troy Aikman signed a multiyear deal with ESPN to become the voices of Monday Night Football. Despite shifting his focus mostly to the NFL, Buck returned for an MLB game alongside Chip Caray in the St. Louis Cardinals' booth in 2024.\n\nBuck and Caray also have fathers who were sports broadcasters. Joe Buck worked alongside his father, Jack, as a Cardinals radio and television broadcaster from 1991 to 2007.\n\nHe also called the PGA Tournament and hosted an alternate broadcast in 2022. The 56-year-old broadcaster prefers calling baseball games earlier in the season because he feels more prepared.\n\n“For someone who hasn’t been involved in the game for four years, and I did Opening Day last year, I think it’s easier to launch off the beginning of the season because it’s not looking back,” Buck told Traina.\n\nBuck also believes calling a game featuring the back-to-back World Series champions will make his job easier.\n\n“It’s a Dodger game, I think it’s Dodger-Mets so, there’s a lot to talk about. I mean, I could probably do it right now. The Dodgers, half their lineup’s going to end up in the Hall of Fame. They’re easy names.”\n\nWhile Buck didn’t officially rule out calling a game later in the season or during the playoffs, he acknowledged it would be much more challenging.\n\n“I’m not prepared to do that without putting myself in solitary confinement for a month and trying to catch up with everything that’s gone on,” Buck said.\n\nBefore Buck’s four-year absence from baseball, he was one of the most recognizable voices in the sport. He served as Fox’s lead play-by-play announcer from 1996 to 2021. During that time, Buck called 23 World Series and 21 All-Star Games, the most by any play-by-play announcer on network television.\n\nBuck will receive the 2026 Ford C. Frick Award, which is presented annually to a broadcaster for major contributions to baseball. Buck and his father will become the first father-son duo to receive the award.",

    "description": "I rode in business class on the Amtrak NextGen Acela train from NYC to Washington, DC, for $180. It was a great experience, but not worth the price.",
    "fullText": "The Amtrak Acela is an express service between Boston and Washington, DC. The train line introduced a new fleet on the route in August 2025, known as NextGen Acela.\n\nIn addition to being the fastest Amtrak train with a top speed of 160 miles per hour, the NextGen Acela has modern interiors and high-tech amenities.\n\nThe Amtrak Acela trains only have two classes — business and first. I booked my business-class ticket for $180.\n\nOut of curiosity, I looked at the pricing for coach seating on the regional Amtrak train, which is 30 minutes slower than the Acela. It was $40.\n\nMy train was scheduled to leave at 10 a.m., but there was a 90-minute delay. Since I was stuck at the station for longer than anticipated, I briefly considered going to the Metropolitan Lounge, an elevated space overlooking the train hall with cozy seating and complimentary refreshments.\n\nFirst-class passengers and those traveling in sleeper accommodations can get into the lounge for free, but other Amtrak riders have to pay $50 to access it.\n\nSince I'd already splurged on the business-class ticket, I decided to skip the lounge and head to the standard waiting room instead, but it was full. I finally settled for a seat on the floor against the wall until it was time to board.\n\nWhen I got in line to board, I was reminded that business class is just a standard ticket on the Amtrak Acela. Unlike business-class rides I've taken that also had coach seating, this trip didn't include the perk of priority boarding.\n\nSoft, cushy, spacious, supportive — these are the words that popped into my head when I settled into my business-class seat. A reclining function and footrest made the ride even more comfortable.\n\nPower outlets, USB ports, and a reading light were all conveniently located on the side of the seat. In front of me was a tray table and a fold-out cupholder.\n\nMost Amtrak trains I've been on have had WiFi, but in my experience, the connection has typically been too weak for much more than a Google search.\n\nI was stoked when the NextGen Acela's 5G WiFi was fast enough to stream YouTube videos without any issues. I passed the time by watching live sessions of my favorite bands.\n\nI've learned to set the bar low for train bathrooms. Stocked toilet paper, soap, and paper towels are not a given. Cleanliness and extra space aren't either. In my experience, some business-class bathrooms are no different from those in coach.\n\nSo I was ecstatic when I stepped inside the lavatory on the NextGen Acela. The automatic door opened into a spotless space that felt big enough for two people to do jumping jacks simultaneously.\n\nI found it aesthetically pleasing too, with bold red accents and trendy touches, from the shelf to the mirror.\n\nI also appreciated the touchless water, soap, and dryer functions on the sink.\n\n\"Amtrak travelers always have their preference,\" an Amtrak representative wrote in an email to Business Insider. \"If they want to experience these premium trains with enhanced amenities, they can. Or, if they prefer convenient and affordable downtown-to-downtown service up and down the Northeast Corridor, Northeast Regional trains offer a comfortable and enjoyable way to travel throughout the Northeast Corridor and points beyond.\"\n\nThe next time I take an Amtrak train, I'll miss the cozy seat, elevated bathroom, high-speed WiFi, and shorter travel time. Still, these perks weren't enough for me to consider Acela's business class to be worth more than quadruple the price of a coach ticket.",

    "fullText": "Study author says tech companies are reaping benefits of artificial intelligence age but society is left to pay cost\n\nThe AI boom has caused as much carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere in 2025 as emitted by the whole of New York City, it has been claimed.\n\nThe global environmental impact of the rapidly spreading technology has been estimated in research published on Wednesday which also found that AI-related water use now exceeds the entirety of global bottled-water demand.\n\nThe figures have been compiled by the Dutch academic Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of Digiconomist, a company that researches the unintended consequences of digital trends. He claimed they are the first attempt to measure the specific effect of artificial intelligence rather than datacentres in general as the use of chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini soared in 2025.\n\nThe figures show the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from AI use are also now equivalent to more than 8% of global aviation emissions. His study used technology companies’ own reporting and he called for stricter requirements for them to be more transparent about their climate impact.\n\n“The environmental cost of this is pretty huge in absolute terms,” he said. “At the moment society is paying for these costs, not the tech companies. The question is: is that fair? If they are reaping the benefits of this technology, why should they not be paying some of the costs?”\n\nDe Vries-Gao found that the 2025 carbon footprint of AI systems could be as high as 80m tonnes, while the water used could reach 765bn litres. He said it was the first time AI’s water impact had been estimated and showed that AI water use alone was more than a third higher than previous estimates of all datacentre water use.\n\nThe figures are published in the academic journal Patterns. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said earlier this year that AI-focused datacentres draw as much electricity as power-thirsty aluminium smelters and datacentre electricity consumption is expected to more than double by 2030.\n\n“This is yet more evidence that the public is footing the environmental bill for some of the richest companies on Earth,” said Donald Campbell, the director of advocacy at Foxglove, a UK non-profit that campaigns for fairness in tech. “Worse, it is likely just the tip of the iceberg. The datacentre construction frenzy, driven by generative AI, is only getting started.\n\n“Just one of these new ‘hyperscale’ facilities can generate climate emissions equivalent to several international airports. And in the UK alone, there are an estimated 100-200 of them in the planning system,” said Campbell.\n\nThe IEA has reported that the largest AI-focused datacentres being built today will each consume as much electricity as 2m households with the US accounting for the largest share of datacentre electricity consumption (45%) followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%).\n\nThe largest datacentre being planned in the UK, at a former coal power station site in Blyth, Northumberland, is expected to emit more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 a year when at full operation – the equivalent to the amount produced by more than 24,000 homes.\n\nIn India, where $30bn (£22.5bn) is being invested in datacentres, there are growing concerns that a lack of reliability from the National Grid will mean the construction of huge diesel generator farms for backup power, which the consultancy KPMG this week called “a massive … carbon liability”.\n\nTechnology companies’ environmental disclosures are often insufficient to assess even the total datacentre impact, never mind isolating AI use, said De Vries-Gao. He noted that when Google recently reported on the impact of its Gemini AI, it did not account for the water used in generating the electricity needed to power it.\n\nGoogle reported that in 2024 it managed to reduce energy emissions from its datacentres by 12% due to new clean energy sources, but it said this summer that achieving its climate goals was “now more complex and challenging across every level – from local to global” and “a key challenge is the slower-than-needed deployment of carbon-free energy technologies at scale”.\n\nGoogle was approached for comment.",

Several churches in the Lower Hudson Valley and across the state have filed for bankruptcy or sold their properties to make up for the money.\n\n“As we have repeatedly acknowledged, the sexual abuse of minors long ago has brought shame upon our church,” Dolan said Monday, according to the New York Post. “I once again ask forgiveness for the failing of those who betrayed the trust placed in them by failing to provide for the safety of our young people.”\n\nThe Archdiocese of New York has not yet responded to comments regarding the retirement or replacement claims.\n\nContributing: lohud's Nancy Cutler\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rockland/Westchester Journal News: Why did Cardinal Dolan resign?

    "fullText": "When New York State banned phones in public schools from bell to bell this past September, the goal — according to the ban’s champion, Governor Hochul — was undistracted learning. But within weeks of the Great Phone Lockup, teachers began to notice an incidental (and arguably even more compelling) benefit: The teens were talking to one another as if they were in a Brat Pack movie. Sure, there’s been grumbling and some burner phones and scrolling in the bathroom. At one high school, an entrepreneurial senior even bought a pouch-unlocking magnet on Amazon and tried to charge classmates a dollar per jailbreak. But generally, with phones off-limits, the atmosphere feels different. There’s a pleasant buzz in the lunchroom, chatter in the hallways, and an alphabet of new analog hobbies popping up just about everywhere. “We’ve had a lot more school spirit,” says Rosalmi, a senior at New Heights Academy Charter School in Harlem. “People are more willing to do stuff.”\n\nWhat stuff are they doing? At many schools, teachers have made cards, board games, and sports equipment available during free time, and the kids have deigned to use them. Kevin Casado, a coach and teacher at Math, Engineering, and Science Academy Charter High School in Bushwick, hands out volleyballs every lunch period. He says a lot more kids are playing this year than were last year. “It’s no net, open space, forming their own circles of ten or 12 kids, hitting it up to each other, an equal number of girls and boys,” he adds. Aidan Amin, a ninth-grader at Hunter College High School, is in a friend group that congregates in the school foyer to stack OK Play tiles and compete at Sorry! and other tabletop games during lunch. “I’d say it’s made us closer. Honestly, half the people I’m playing board games with I didn’t know at all before this,” Aidan says.\n\nAt Rosalmi’s school, dominoes rule the cafeteria. “Dominoes is really a staple Dominican game. People get passionate. You have to slam that first piece down on the table!” she says, adding that there’s trash talk “but it’s game trash talk. It’s really funny.” About 11 miles south, at Brooklyn Technical High School, the name of the game is poker, the trash talk is (sometimes) in Russian, and instead of chips or cash, the kids bet with hair ties. Josh (not his real name), a junior there, says about half a dozen games go on during free periods. He tends to play Texas Hold’em with a group of friends he made this year. Their antics draw spectators and even side wagers: “We have one player who is probably the least skilled, but a lot of people bet on him because he has absurd luck,” he says. “He pulled our group’s first-of-the-year full house with pocket aces. He’s very entertaining.”\n\nOther students have discovered vintage technology like Game Boys and mp3 players. Alexei Kotov is a sophomore at Aviation High School in Queens. He bought a CD Walkman on Amazon last year, and since the phone ban started, he has been packing his dad’s old CDs — the Doors, Weezer — in his backpack. “My favorite one’s probably No Doubt’s Tragic Kingdom,” Alexei says. “I like the vocals. It’s, like, really emotional.” He shares his earbuds at lunch and swaps recommendations with friends. “One of them is really into Queen,” he says.\n\nNoshin Sayira is a junior at Stuyvesant High School, meaning she’s in the middle of the highest-pressure year at what may be one of the highest-pressure high schools in the country. She tells me that students’ top objection to the phone policy is that it’s become cumbersome to do homework between classes or to quickly study in the hallway before a test. But Noshin recently started printing out her study guides and has found that reviewing on paper actually works better: “I don’t get distracted by notifications,” she says. She and her friends have developed a stress-relieving free-period ritual: They sketch one another’s outfits. “One of my friends usually has supplies like colored pencils and proper paper,” she says.\n\nTokyo Levy, a seventh-grader at I.S. 318 in Williamsburg, is a discernibly different kid than he was in his phone-carrying days, at least according to his mother, Krystyna Printup, an art teacher at the Brooklyn School for Social Justice in Bushwick. “He was forced into the rapid learning and usage of technology during COVID when he had to attend school from home via Zoom,” she says. That led to a fixation on video and computer games — Minecraft, Clash Royale — then social media. “Now, his phone is no longer clutched by his side to run to after dinner or before bed. There have even been a couple days where he’s left his phone accidentally at home.” At school, after noticing kids gathered around chess boards during lunch, he decided to “I’ve always thought of people who played chess as really intelligent people. I see other people play, and it has really motivated me to try it out for myself,” he says. Participating in soccer in the schoolyard at recess inspired him to join a soccer league in his neighborhood, too.\n\nLately, he’s been bugging his parents not for a new video game or an upgraded phone but for a mainstay of their own childhoods: a bicycle. He wants to hang out with the new friends he’s made at school on the weekends.",

However, New England will need to wait for the outcome of the last two weeks, which will be determined by division opponents, to see if it can clinch the AFC East title.\n\nNew England currently has an 11-3 record, while Buffalo is at 10-4. If the Patriots win their remaining games, they will secure the AFC East title. However, after losing to Buffalo in Week 15, they lost the head-to-head tiebreaker, as the Patriots and Bills split their matchups this season.\n\nThe next tiebreaker is based on wins against division opponents. The Patriots have a 3-1 record, while the Bills are 3-2 following their loss to the Dolphins.\n\nEven if the Patriots lose to the Ravens but defeat the Jets and Dolphins, New England will still claim the AFC East title, even if the Bills win all their remaining games.\n\nPatriots-Ravens Injury Report: Lamar Jackson Among Starters Missing On Both Sides",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "description": "Manhattan federal prosecutors have charged Tricolor execs Daniel Chu and David Goodgame of scheming to defraud banks and private credit lenders.",
    "fullText": "Founder Daniel Chu and the company's Chief Operating Officer David Goodgame, who were arrested and charged with bank fraud and wire fraud on Wednesday, planned to frighten at least one lender into a favorable deal, prosecutors allege. According to the indictment, the executives discussed telling a lender that the company might otherwise implode, much like the energy trading firm Enron in 2001, if a deal wasn't reached. This would be bad for the lender because it would put them at risk of losing everything.\n\n\"Enron obviously has a nice ring to it, right?\" Chu said when discussing with other Tricolor executives how to deal with one particular lender who had figured out the double-pledging issue.\n\n\"I mean, Enron, Enron raises the blood pressure of the lender when they see that. It, it has to, right?\" Chu said while laughing, documents show.\n\nIt's just one of several recorded conversations that emerged as part of a newly unsealed indictment against Chu and Goodgame. The indictment accused the men of orchestrating a years-long scheme to defraud banks and other private credit providers.\n\nChu is expected to be presented in a Florida court on Wednesday. Goodgame should be presented in a Texas court on Thursday. The men could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nTricolor rocked the banking industry when it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September, leaving lenders like JPMorgan, Fifth Third Bank, and Jefferies exposed.\n\nAt the time of the company's September 10 bankruptcy, its largest lenders were owed more than $900 million \"as a result of the fraudulent double-pledging and collateral manipulation schemes\" orchestrated by Chu and supported by Goodgame, the feds said.\n\nBut that didn't stop Chu from using company money to enrich himself, according to prosecutors. They said Chu directed another executive to pay him the final installments of a $15 million bonus as the company approached bankruptcy, resulting in two payments from Tricolor totaling $6.25 million. Chu then used some of this money to purchase a multimillion-dollar property in Beverly Hills, California — weeks before Tricolor filed for Chapter 7, the feds said.\n\nThe back-to-back bankruptcies of Tricolor and auto parts company First Brands have raised questions about the health of the credit market, prompting JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon to tell investors that he has his \"antenna\" up.\n\n\"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,\" Dimon said on the bank's third-quarter earnings call with analysts.",

He has not yet made a formal announcement.\n\nTo back the claims, however, the newspaper’s sources further revealed that Bongino has begun shipping office “knick-knacks” and other personal belongings back to Florida, where he plans to resume his broadcasting career in time for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nSources told Fox News Digital on Monday that Bongino had not made a final decision and denied his office was empty, but did add that he was expected to declare his intentions in the coming weeks.\n\nThe former podcaster arrived at the FBI this year promising disruption and ideological clarity, after President Donald Trump nominated him.\n\nHowever, the Times reported that earlier this month, Bongino floated the idea of choreographing his exit around a major law enforcement moment to associates. He allegedly said he may announce his resignation at a press conference tied to the investigation into who planted pipe bombs near Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the January 6 riots in 2021.\n\nThe newspaper added that behind-the-scenes, Bongino has also made a point of repairing relations with Attorney General Pam Bondi, whom he had accused of mishandling the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein in July.\n\nAt that time, he reportedly threatened to resign after Bondi’s department released a memo concluding that the much-hyped “Epstein client list” did not, in fact, exist – a topic that had been a focus of Bongino’s podcast before his tenure.\n\nThe post Dan Bongino Clearing Out His Office in Preparation for FBI Exit: NY Times first appeared on Mediaite.",

The BBC reported on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.\n\nThe agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The New York Times first reported British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.\n\n“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.\n\nThe Trade Representative’s office said in a post on Twitter/X that these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.\n\n“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.\n\nThomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to the New York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.\n\nThe retaliation by the US follows a $140m fine slapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.",

    "description": "Trump’s AI “Manhattan Project” will fail if DOGE cuts are kept, critics say.",
    "fullText": "Described as a “historic national effort” to “invest in AI-enabled science to accelerate scientific advancement,” Trump claimed his mission would address key challenges to American energy dominance, innovation, and national security.\n\nThis mission, Trump boasted, would be a game-changer to science akin to putting a man on the moon or firing the first nuclear weapons. By building “an integrated AI platform” trained on “the world’s largest collection” of federal scientific data sets, he promised, the government could set off cascades of scientific breakthroughs.\n\nAccess to such a platform, Trump imagined, would supercharge top US labs, powering AI agents to do tasks like quickly test hypotheses and automate research workflows to speed up discoveries.\n\nHowever, the mission crucially depends on strengthening collaboration between public, private, and academic sectors. And Trump’s order is concerningly vague on how those partnerships will be structured and funded at a time when many scientists have been sidelined due to a flurry of Trump orders earlier this year that eliminated their funding or removed them from their labs.\n\nTo critics, including scientists, policy experts, advocates, and historians, Trump’s order seems divorced from reality, given that he spent the past year attacking some of the very institutions the Genesis Mission would seem to depend on. Trump also seemed unclear about what can be achieved with AI and confused about how scientific progress is actually made, some critics suggested.\n\nAmong the critics was Arati Prabhakar, who served as the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden administration. Prabhakar told Ars that Trump’s crippling cuts to government science agencies, research grant funding freezes, and attacks on universities must be repaired or his mission will fail.\n\n“After the Trump administration has inflicted so much damage to valuable datasets and publicly funded research, the new executive order is a Band-Aid on a giant gash,” Prabhakar said.\n\nAlso skeptical of Trump’s plans is Kathryn Kelley, executive director for the Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation, an educational nonprofit representing more than 100 of “the nation’s most forward-thinking universities and computing centers,” CASC’s LinkedIn said.\n\nHer group is specifically dedicated to Genesis Mission-aligned goals, “advocating for the use of the most advanced computing technology to accelerate scientific discovery for national competitiveness, global security, and economic success.” And while Trump’s initiative could be considered “a step in the right direction,” Kelley told Ars that she shares Prabhakar’s concerns.\n\n“Many research institutions and national laboratories continue to experience funding uncertainty, program disruptions, and workforce instability stemming from earlier cuts,” Kelley told Ars.\n\nParticular pain points considered critical to address for Genesis Mission to move forward include reversing “impacts on staffing, ongoing research, and student pipelines,” she suggested.\n\nIn one prominent example, some Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts targeting workers at the National Science Foundation hit hardest in the branch designed to accelerate technology development across a wide range of research settings in the US. DOGE slashed workers there simply because it was the youngest directorate at NSF with the most workers in transition when Trump took office. As courts weighed legal challenges to cuts, whistleblowers warned that Trump was aiming to politicize and dismantle NSF.\n\n“Large-scale initiatives like Genesis rely on highly skilled personnel, robust infrastructure, and sustained program support—some of the very resources at NSF and other federal agencies that were disrupted,” Kelley told Ars. “Rebuilding trust, re-establishing lost programs, and stabilizing the research workforce will be essential to make this mission feasible.”\n\nCritics urged that Trump’s attacks on science also included messing with government datasets that scientists depend on. Since Trump’s second term started, scientists have watched valuable data get censored or scrubbed from government websites. Some researchers have rushed to recreate datasets independently with the help of the Internet Archive.\n\nPrabhakar pointed out that some “datasets that could improve health and prevent disasters are eroding or even disappearing due to this administration,” while universities training “the next generation of great researchers and innovators have reduced or even stopped graduate admissions because of Trump’s assault.”\n\nWithout a massive undertaking to undo moves that critics have said undermined both US science and trust in it, Trump’s dreams of launching AI models that would propel a million moonshots could go down in history as merely hype.\n\n“Without robust data and research and without people’s trust, America won’t lead in AI,” Prabhakar said.\n\nFor people in the science community, it’s hard to square Trump’s aggressive cuts from earlier this year with the broad ambition of Genesis Mission. Frustratingly, the president demands that scientists make discoveries on his timeline, without acknowledging AI’s limitations or how his attacks on science could be driving away talent that could help labs advance AI.\n\nIn many fields, scientists are still exploring how AI can aid research. Trump’s order appears to politicize science by focusing on areas he favors—like critical materials, nuclear energy, biotechnology, and quantum computing—despite their limited AI applications or data-quality challenges. Meanwhile, critics noted that it overlooks areas where “supercharging” AI could perhaps be more impactful—but where Trump notably does not want to leave his mark—like climate science or vaccine research.\n\nIt also lays out aggressive timelines for results, demanding that the Department of Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, “demonstrate an initial operating capability of the Platform for at least one of the national science and technology challenges” identified in less than a year (270 days). Ideally, Trump’s mission will have generated significant discoveries in key fields within the next three years before he leaves office, his order outlined.\n\nPaul Josephson, a Colby College professor and expert in the history of 20th-century science and technology, told Ars that Genesis Mission deadlines differ from John F. Kennedy’s 10-year timeline to reach the moon.\n\nTrump’s order “shows tremendous ignorance of how science and technology work,” Josephson said. The White House is saying, “Tell me what your discoveries will be and how many there will be in three years,” Josephson said, expecting that “we can pick the places where we want discoveries and make them happen.”\n\n“That’s not anything like how science works,” Josephson told Ars, reducing Genesis Mission to “a vision without policy” and “a hope without funding.”\n\nTo Josephson, Trump’s order sounded “more like it came out of Silicon Valley” than out of talks with government scientists, seemingly rushing approvals of industry partnerships and incentives without mentioning what resources would be available to fund gutted labs or train the next generation of scientists. It’s perhaps notable that the order is DOE-centric and does not place the same emphasis on contributions from universities or national labs funded by NSF and the National Institutes of Health as it does on industry partners.\n\nKelley told Ars that “many public datasets are already being used effectively in research and industry” in the ways that Trump intends his AI platform to amplify. However, “there are areas—such as advanced nuclear research or emerging energy technologies—where datasets are limited.” And Trump risks reducing Genesis Mission to bluster by claiming that an AI platform could drive breakthroughs to the major challenges he flagged in the short term.\n\n“There is a real risk that the EO’s ambitious framing could overpromise what AI can achieve in the near term without addressing foundational data gaps,” Kelley told Ars. “That said, even partial progress in these areas could provide valuable insights, but expectations need to be realistic.”\n\nJust as important as asking where Genesis Mission funding is coming from or who the funding is going to, Chris R. Glass asks: “Where’s the talent coming from?”\n\nTrump’s order does not forecast that, only vaguely referencing support for universities training scientists. This comes, of course, after the administration revoked an estimated $1.5 billion in federal grant money in 2025. Those grant cuts shrank the pipeline for PhD students at an “unprecedented rate,” Axios reported.\n\nA Boston College professor who researches global student mobility and the impact of emergent technology on learning, Glass told Ars that Trump has notably left international talent out of his AI plans, despite the prominent roles that both “domestic and international scientists play in our current leadership” in AI.\n\nIn a recent Washington Post op-ed, Glass warned that “America is losing research scientists,” who are seeking more stable environments to set up their lives and conduct long-term studies.\n\nAs the Trump administration has attacked immigrants, other governments like the European Union and China have benefited by offering friendlier visa systems to attract the best and brightest minds graduating from US universities. Of course, of the two, China is America’s bigger AI rival. Earlier this year, China began heavily recruiting American scientists spooked by Trump’s grant funding cuts, and Glass confirmed that China has continued those efforts with the AI race heating up. Meanwhile, Trump appears to be going the other direction, recently requiring a $100,000 payment for some skilled workers seeking non-immigrant visas.\n\nThroughout 2025, US universities’ ability to attract international students showed resilience, but “we’re on thin ice,” Glass told Ars, with that resilience “waning.”\n\nCurrently, the US “is ranked the lowest among top destinations for its safety and welcoming and the lowest for its post-graduation visa policies,” Glass said, noting that doctoral students must affirm that they do not intend to immigrate, even though the majority of STEM PhD students stay in the US after graduating.\n\n“They want to stay, and we want them to stay,” Glass told Ars.\n\nAnother concerning outcome of Trump cuts that could hamper Genesis Mission: Entire research groups at many institutions were “displaced”—removed from their labs and left to work in cubicles without access to their equipment, Glass told Ars.\n\n“I think scientists want to go where the best sciences are being done, but eventually these kinds of friction points and these hostile policies make them redirect elsewhere, even temporarily redirect, earn their doctorate in Europe and hope that the policy environment in the US changes,” Glass said.\n\nTo turn it around, Glass made several recommendations in his op-ed to help retain PhD graduates and create stable pathways for high-value talents. That includes suggesting that the Trump administration consider fast-tracking green cards for students in fields that Genesis Mission depends on, including AI and machine-learning researchers, quantum computing scientists, and semiconductor engineers.\n\nHe also thinks the US should “unlock the O-1A visa for researchers and entrepreneurs” by redefining what makes someone an “extraordinary” talent and creating dedicated “founder tracks” for international talent, as Britain and Singapore do. That visa is “uncapped yet underused,” Glass said, only approving 4,500 STEM candidates in 2023.\n\nWithout changes to the visa system, the US “risks redirecting those talent flows,” he said. “And like a river, once those talent flows get redirected, they are very difficult to reverse.”\n\nAnd it won’t just be international talents jumping ship, Glass suggested, but also possibly US scientists forced to continue navigating potentially more of Trump’s cuts and indirect costs in the coming years.\n\n“I think that’s the kind of thing that slowly eats away at someone’s desire to continue to do science in the United States,” Glass said.\n\nGlass told Ars that he expects the US to stay on a “downward trajectory,” driving away talent in 2026, which Josephson suggested “will damage science both for the short and long term.”\n\n“Many universities figured out a one-year contingency plan, but reality will set in if funding continues to be cut,” Glass said.\n\nCASC’s Kelley told Ars that like university international student recruitment, “the US research ecosystem continues to be resilient, but the gap between ambitious goals and the current capacity must be carefully managed.”\n\n“While the Genesis Mission signals strong intentions to invest in science and technology, its success will depend on aligning resources, rebuilding workforce capacity, and thoughtfully integrating AI and data capabilities where they are most effective,” Kelley said.\n\nA scientist might be best positioned to understand the nuance that requires, but Josephson noted that Trump tasked his Science Advisor, Michael Kratsios, with leading the initiative. Unlike prior officials serving in that role, Kratsios is not a scientist and has no PhD, earning his BA in politics. Instead, Kratsios has strong industry ties, previously serving as chief of staff for venture capitalist Peter Thiel and managing director of a company called Scale AI.\n\nTo Josephson, Kratsios as head of the mission—which “seems to be totally based on faith in AI and datasets to do everything”—makes the initiative seem more aligned with Silicon Valley ambitions than public good. That could be a problem since historically, it has never worked when governments attempt to “pick winners” or pass industrial policy with claims that “if we do this, we will come out on top.”\n\n“It’s a belief in AI as the cure or the panacea for all the world’s problems to ensure we’re a dominant technological power, but ignoring climate change, race, gender, anything that is important in daily life,” Josephson said.\n\nJosephson is also an expert in Russian and Soviet history, explaining that precedent shows there are “tremendous dangers” of governments controlling which sciences are funded. In some ways, he thinks Genesis Mission “smells of Putin,” he told Ars, warning that Trump’s attempts to hoard and censor science in 2025 have been “as damaging to science and technology in the world’s leading centers as totalitarian regimes have been.”\n\n“It reflects the general timbre of the Trump administration toward the scientific enterprise,” he suggested, saying that the president has embraced the “authoritarian view” that he “has the right to pick and choose which fields and which branches merit more support and which should not be funded at all.”\n\nJules Barbati-Dajches, an analyst for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), told Ars that in addition to cuts, Trump recently “weakened federal agency policies (called scientific integrity policies) that were specifically in place to protect federal agency science from political interference.” This further threatens scientific integrity, Barbati-Dajches warned in August.\n\nUCS has tracked “instances of science being sidelined, ignored, or misused by the federal government” across “multiple presidential administrations” for two decades, Barbati-Dajches told Ars. And although their methodology was recently updated, the current Trump administration stands out, as “the rate and impact of attacks on science we’ve observed over the past nine months far outpace anything UCS has tracked before,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nAdditionally, UCS has documented “cases of the administration using AI in their reports and research that raise concern” that AI initiatives like Genesis Mission may promote dubious claims to serve “politicized” outcomes, Barbati-Dajches said.\n\n“This altogether paints a very troubling picture,” Barbati-Dajches said. “Scientific innovation and discovery are exciting, important, and can help inform federal policy and guidance. But as history tells us (and recent history even more so), science in the federal government needs protective guardrails to keep it independent and free from undue influence.”\n\nWith Trump pushing for rapid buildouts of AI data centers—sparking widespread backlash among Americans—Barbati-Dajches noted that UCS has documented his administration making “policy choices and decisions that benefit favored interests (including tech and fossil fuel companies) over the health and safety of the public and planet.” Genesis Mission appears to follow that trend, critics suggested, along with Trump’s most recent executive order threatening to block state AI laws, which many consider a gift to the tech industry.\n\n“And meanwhile, most Americans are clear they don’t trust AI and want it regulated—but this administration has opposed even basic guardrails,” Prabhakar said.\n\nPlanning to closely monitor Genesis Mission, UCS is keen to get answers to many questions, such as “who will have access to the platform that’s being created as part of this initiative” and “who will own or will benefit from the outputs of this type of program?”\n\nJosephson said that it’s unlikely Genesis Mission will advance much before the midterm elections. In the next steps, Congress will have to approve funding for the mission, as its broad ambitions, if supported, would surely require structure to continue across multiple administrations.\n\nTo Barbati-Dajches, it’s critical that Genesis Mission is “viewed in the context of [the Trump administration’s] pattern of anti-science actions.”\n\n“One of my main concerns is that this type of mission is being funded in the name of science and innovation when the administration has continuously and methodically attacked federal scientific systems since Inauguration Day,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Genesis Mission will amount to anything but hype. But Josephson noted that perhaps the most blustery part of Trump’s order was a claim that “from the founding of the Republic, scientific discovery and technological innovation have driven American progress and prosperity.”\n\nThe US only began funding research in the back half of the 19th century, Josephson said, “but the amount of money coming from the federal government to the sciences was limited until the Manhattan Project.” After that, the US emerged as a “leading scientific power” in the Cold War, not by racing for “global technology dominance,” as Trump wants, but by embracing science as a “national good.”\n\nAs it stands now, Genesis Mission’s biggest flaw might stem from Trump’s disdain for DEI, which fueled his attacks on science and universities all year, Josephson suggested.\n\n“Funding science and technology and allowing the scientific community through peer review to determine what is the best science and to give funding to encourage young people to enter the science pipeline and to ensure that there are more women and people of color in the scientific community, so that more and more brains are taking part—there’s none of that in the Genesis Mission,” Josephson said.",

Carter was standing atop a blue, double-decker bus, waiting for their parade to begin, when she noticed a young fan in the crowd.\n\nThe fan stood in the cold, beaming with excitement, holding a sign not meant for Carter, but Gotham’s goalkeeper and Carter’s fiancée, Ann-Katrin Berger.\n\n“He was just so excited to see us, but it wasn’t to see us, it was to see Ann,” Carter told The Athletic on a recent video call, with a proud smile. “We’ve always talked about inspiring little girls, but that’s a little boy, and he’s looking up to us and thinking that this is something he could do. That was a really beautiful moment.”\n\nGotham’s celebrations punctuated the end of a grueling season for the 28-year-old defender. In a span of 181 days, Carter won three major titles for both club and country: the inaugural Concacaf W Champions Cup with Gotham in May, the European Championship with England in July, and, last month, she helped Gotham win their second NWSL title.\n\n“Winning with England is always incredible, and getting to win this trophy here with Gotham has been amazing,” Carter said. She laughed, then continued, “I’m still trying to understand this league (the NWSL). But being part of it and seeing how special the championship is, and how much it means to everyone, is incredible. This team, they’re great people. So, getting to do it with them was even better.”\n\nCarter signed with Gotham last summer after six years at Chelsea. The five-time Women’s Super League champion, already one of the best defenders in the world, quickly became a vital part of the NWSL club’s backline.\n\n“The athleticism here is unmatched,” Carter said. “It’s like nothing I’ve ever experienced before, on a regular basis. Everybody seems to be super strong and super fast and super fit, whereas when I played in Europe, I felt I was competing more comfortably for strength and for pace with a lot of players. Here, everything has to be spotless; otherwise, you get punished.”\n\nWhile the WSL remains more tactical, the style of play in NWSL is rapidly evolving, Carter said.\n\n“Even since I’ve been here just over a year, teams that maybe would have traditionally gone a bit more direct are now trying to play out through the back, and they’re trying to build and (be) more technical and tactical,” she said. “That’s coming into the NWSL a lot more. I think having a lot of players from all over the world is what contributes to that.”\n\nFor Carter, the celebrations in Manhattan doubled as a belated celebration for winning a second consecutive Euros with England over the summer. She missed out on the massive homecoming her national team received in London after topping Spain in the final, opting instead to fly back to the United States early to rejoin Gotham.\n\nComing back served as a necessary reset for Carter, who was targeted by online racist abuse from the start of the tournament. Two days before England’s semifinal against Italy, Carter shared a statement on Instagram condemning the abuse. She said she would be stepping away from social media as a result.\n\n“It was really tough,” Carter said. “I’m not someone who would speak out about something like that. I’m happy to ask for help, but I don’t think I really realized how much I needed support at the time. A lot of people are taught from young to ignore it and move on and rise above it. And it’s, like – actually, why? Why should we not speak about it?”\n\nAt first, Carter ignored the abuse and moved on, believing any response would be giving in. But the hate didn’t stop.\n\n“You don’t want to let those people win,” she said. “It’s only getting worse and worse in the women’s game, and that’s something that we don’t want to be part of our game.”\n\nCarter’s sister encouraged the defender to speak out, asking her to consider how she would feel if this were happening to her nieces or nephews, or her teammates.\n\n“There’s a lot of stuff that happens in football that you just have to get on with, but my sister was like, ‘If this was Khiara (Keating), LJ (Lauren James), me – if this was them it was happening to, you’d want to be able to support them. You’d want them to speak up about it.’ I was like, ‘Yeah, of course I would.’\n\n“I’ve got mixed-race nieces and nephews. It’s not just about me. It’s for all the little boys and girls looking up to me or trying to find anybody that looks like them. It’s really hard to find anyone that looks like me trying to do my job, and the fact that I can be that for someone else, I owe it to myself and to them to continue to fight.”\n\nThere was an immediate outpouring of support for Carter, from her coach, Sarina Wiegman, and her teammates, to the global soccer community. “But then on the other side of it, I got more abuse for attention seeking and lying or bringing that negative attention on the team,” Carter said. “It’s like, you could have 1,000 positive comments, but there’s one or two, still, I think (that) hurt more than the 1,000 positive.”\n\nTwo men have been arrested in relation to the online racist abuse sent to Carter, which she sees as an important step toward meaningful change. The matter remains ongoing. The BBC reported earlier this week that one man will be summoned to court, with police telling the publication he would be charged with making malicious communications.\n\n“A lot of reasons why people don’t speak up when they face any abuse, is because, well, what’s it going to do? (They think that) nothing’s going to happen. … When people see there’s repercussions to their actions, they just might second-guess what they say or what they do,” Carter said. “Holding people accountable is the biggest step in trying to keep the women’s game as clean as possible.”\n\nCarter was with the Lionesses when they won their first-ever Euros championship in England. They overcame eight-time champions Germany in the final in extra time. But this summer, when they defeated World Cup winners Spain, it felt different for Carter, who played a bigger role on the pitch for their 2025 championship.\n\nCarter remembers how “up and down” the tournament felt for England, which opened the competition with a stunning loss to France, followed by a 4-0 bounce-back victory against the Netherlands.\n\n“What I’m most proud of is staying true to myself in that whole experience of the Euros,” Carter said. “For me, it’s about: how do we rise above it and show what I can do and continue to persevere and grow? That’s the biggest thing that I took away from the Euros. It’s not even just the win. It’s the fight, the determination, that all of us showed.”\n\nEngland’s path to victory parallels Gotham’s journey to its second NWSL crown in three seasons. The team entered the postseason in the final qualifying spot. They orchestrated the biggest upset of the year when they defeated Kansas City Current – statistically, the best team to ever play in the league – in the quarterfinals.\n\nGotham went on to defeat the Washington Spirit in the championship match. Last year, Gotham was left heartbroken when the Spirit defeated them in the 2024 semifinals after a penalty kick shootout.\n\nGotham’s Championship win happened on a Saturday night in San Jose. By Monday morning, the team was back on the East Coast, standing atop those blue buses as they prepared to roll down Broadway. The celebration felt like it was owed to Gotham and its fanbase after their 2023 championship was met with far less fanfare. The club and city officials made it happen, with 36 hours between Gotham lifting the NWSL trophy in PayPal Park and receiving the keys to New York City on the steps of City Hall.\n\nThis year, Carter has become a more visible face for brands around the world, including e.l.f. Cosmetics in the United States. The makeup company spotlighted Carter as one of their chosen trailblazers in a documentary-style campaign series.\n\nShe plans to enjoy downtime and visit family in England and Germany. Then she will be “ready to go again.” “It’s been nice to switch off from football, that’s for sure,” Carter said.\n\nGotham has a short offseason, with the inaugural FIFA Women’s Champions Cup fast approaching. When Gotham won the Concacaf W Champions Cup in May, they qualified as the reigning continental champions to FIFA’s new global club competition. They will play Brazilian club Corinthians in the tournament’s semifinal on Jan. 28 at the Brentford Community Stadium in west London. The winner then heads to Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium for the final on Feb. 1.\n\n“Sometimes I wish it was somewhere else, because I know London,” Carter said, with a laugh. “But at the same time, the NWSL deserves to be recognized, and it’s a great opportunity for us to do that in London. Women’s football is excellent in England, and hopefully a lot of women’s football fans turn out and want to come and watch.”\n\nMaybe there will be another young fan in the crowd who will catch Carter’s attention. “When I think about how I’d speak to my younger self, or the younger boys or younger girls, it’s just about staying true to yourself,” Carter said. “I don’t think people realize what you’re capable of, until you’re really put in those tough situations.”\n\nShe is capable of plenty, including a few championships in a span of 181 days.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nEngland, Gotham FC, NWSL, Women's Soccer, Women's Euros\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "New York Jets fans thought the Aaron Rodgers era was bad. Then, the year 2025 was like, hold my beer.\n\nThe truth is, everything that could go wrong, has gone wrong for the Jets in Aaron Glenn’s first season as head coach. After their 48-20 loss to the Jaguars on Sunday, the 3-11 Jets enter their Week 16 matchup against the New Orleans Saints ranking 27th in scoring and 30th in points allowed.\n\nNow, one of their players has decided he’s had enough.\n\nAccording to Jordan Schultz, wide receiver Allen Lazard has requested his release from the team. On Tuesday, the Jets granted Lazard’s request by placing the 30-year-old receiver on release waivers.\n\nAny team can now claim the 6-foot-5 receiver, and the Pittsburgh Steelers are one to keep an eye on, thanks to Lazard’s relationship with Aaron Rodgers after being teammates for eight combined seasons with the Green Bay Packers and Jets.\n\nThough, Lazard hasn’t been particularly productive in New York this season (who has?). He’s been active for ten games, receiving two starts along the way. Yet, he’s only recorded 10 receptions on 18 targets, taking them for 70 yards and a touchdown.\n\nTeams will now have the opportunity to claim the remainder of Lazard’s $2.25 million contract, though he’s reportedly prioritizing the chance to join a contending team, which could put the 8-6 Steelers in play.\n\nMLB Rumor Opens Door To NY Mets, NY Yankees Landing Major Free Agent on Cheap Deal\n\nCanadiens Preview: Fowler Set To Start First Game At Bell Centre\n\n3 Interesting Ohio State Replacements for Caleb Downs and Carnell Tate Emerge in Transfer Portal",

    "description": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing […]",
    "fullText": "An interesting MLB rumor seems to open the door to either the New York Mets or New York Yankees landing a notable free agent they have been linked to for a very team-friendly rate.\n\nThe Mets and Yankees had very different results in their 2025 MLB campaigns. While both clubs entered the year as serious World Series contenders and were two of the best teams in the league during the first half, the club from Queens shockingly collapsed in September and missed the playoffs. Although the Yanks got to the playoffs, they were ousted in the divisional round by the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nAfter seasons that fell well below expectations, both clubs have been active this offseason as they look to improve their roster. Oddly enough, they are also in the market for the same positions. Each team is looking to bolster its rotation and is reportedly pursuing Michael King. They are also looking for new first basemen.\n\nTo the chagrin of Mets fans, the team lost home run king Pete Alonso in free agency to the Baltimore Orioles. While the Yankees are expected to move on from Paul Goldschmidt. Unsurprisingly, they have both been linked to Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami. A player whose market is reportedly weaker than he and his reps expected.\n\nRecent reports have suggested the corner infielder’s market has been weak as he closes in on the Dec. 22 deadline for him to sign with an MLB team. It has created some speculation that he might just end up returning to Japan if he doesn’t get the sort of offer he is looking for. However, Ken Rosenthal doesn’t buy into that discourse.\n\nIn a new report, he spoke about how Murakami’s swing and miss rate is believed to be the big reason why some teams are balking at giving the 25-year-old a big long-term contract. Rosenthal believes that the issue is overblown, and Shohei Ohtani had a higher rate before he made the move from Japan in 2018. The MLB insider firmly believes Murakami will be playing in the MLB next season.\n\nMunetaka Murakami stats: 69 G, .286 AVG, .392 OBP, .659 SLG, 1.051 OPS, 24 HR, 52 RBI, 40 R\n\nThat is very good news for the Mets and Yankees. Despite the questions about his defense and swing and miss rate, he is one of the greatest home run hitters in Japanese baseball history, and still hasn’t even hit his prime. With far fewer teams expected to be in on him, the pair of New York clubs could get a young player with huge upside at a far cheaper rate than they expected a month ago, or for fewer years.\n\nNew York Jets Player Requests Release From Team After 28-Point Loss\n\nCanadiens Preview: Fowler Set To Start First Game At Bell Centre\n\n3 Interesting Ohio State Replacements for Caleb Downs and Carnell Tate Emerge in Transfer Portal",

    "fullText": "Are the Yankees considering a Michael King reunion?\n\nThe Boston Globe's Peter Abraham reported this week that New York, the Orioles and Red Sox \"are competing for\" the free-agent right-hander, whose \"decision is not necessarily soon.\"\n\nThe New York Post's Greg Joyce added that the Yankees are \"open to\" reuniting with King, 30, whom they dealt among others to the Padres in their December 2023 trade with San Diego for outfielders Juan Soto and Trent Grisham.\n\n\"The thing about Kinger is he's got obviously great stuff and a great arsenal,\" New York manager Aaron Boone said last week at the 2025 MLB Winter Meetings in Orlando, Fla., according to Joyce. \"He’s really smart and has a real good understanding of that stuff. It's allowed him to evolve as a pitcher, coupled with his confidence.\"\n\nStarting 45 of 46 regular-season games for the Padres from 2024-25, King went 18-12 with a 3.10 ERA and 1.194 WHIP in 247 IP. He battled injuries during his second year in San Diego, limiting him to 73.1 IP over 15 starts.\n\n\"We are playing around with a lot of different ideas and seeing if it takes us anywhere,\" Yankees general manager Brian Cashman told YES Network last week.\n\nKing transitioned from reliever to starter at the end of his time in New York, a chapter that spanned five MLB seasons (2019-23). He made his MLB debut Sept. 27, 2019, with the Yankees, who landed him from the Miami Marlins in a November 2017 trade.\n\nThe Marlins originally selected King from Boston College with the No. 353 overall pick in the 12th round of the 2016 MLB Draft. The Rochester, N.Y., native played at Warwick (R.I.) Bishop Hendrickson High School before heading to Boston College from 2014-16.",

    "description": "The former New York Ranger of 13 years took his first steps in the visitor's locker room at Madison Square Garden, as Kreider looked forward to tonight's game with his new Anaheim teammates in New York.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK – Chris Kreider mulled the question as he stood outside the visitor’s locker room at Madison Square Garden as an opposing player for the first time.\n\n“Is there one moment that stands out from his 13 years as a Ranger?\"\n\n“That’s a hard one,’’ he said with a smile. “I don’t know.”\n\nNo surprise there as there are countless possibilities for such an answer: his 2012 postseason burst as a rookie playing for John Tortorella, an playoff overtime goal against Boston in 2013, the team's run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2014 – not to mention Kreider's 326 career goals which third-most behind Hall of Famers Rod Gilbert and Jean Ratelle.\n\nKreider on Monday night will be wearing jarring-to-New York-fans Anaheim Ducks orange. He was trying his best to play it cool before what has to be as emotionally charged a return as a former Ranger has experienced since Mark Messier came back to the Garden as a Vancouver Canuck in 1997.\n\n“I'm trying to go in with no expectations and just get ready to play a hockey game. But it's a passionate fan base. It's a place that I've spent the majority of my life, so I'm sure it'll be emotional for me. To what extent, I don't know. I'm just trying to worry about the game.\"\n\nFormer #NYR Chris Kreider addresses the media ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/hqOxVWNewQ\n\n— Mollie Walker (@MollieeWalkerr) December 15, 2025\n\nKreider will be joined in returnee (and likely video tribute) land by former Rangers captain Jacob Trouba who is also playing his first game back since he was traded to Anaheim just over a year ago. Trouba’s road out of New York was rocky and since the physical defenseman played six seasons for Winnipeg, he doesn’t have the lifetime Ranger vibe Kreider possessed until last June when the 2009 Rangers first-round draft pick  was shipped to the Ducks to reunite with Trouba in sunny California.\n\n“I think coming back and seeing familiar faces and seeing friends in the city, that's all great,'' Trouba said. \"I think there's obviously the emotions that come with it. There's not really a playbook for that and how to deal with it. I think I'll also be excited when it's over.\"\n\nKreider and Trouba will be joined by two more former Rangers with the Ducks – Ryan Strome and Frank Vatrano – both key factors in New York’s run to the 2022 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nOne key figure in Monday night’s hockey drama – Kreider’s best friend as Ranger Mike Zibanejad – will not be on the ice as he will be scratched for missing a team meeting. Kreider and Zibanejad were teammates for nine seasons.\n\nDucks coach Joel Quenneville has repeatedly praised the presence of Kreider, 34, and Trouba, 31, on the same roster with young Ducks such as 19-year-old Beckett Sennecke, the team’s 20-year-old leading scorer Leo Carlsson and rising defenseman Jackson LaCombe, 24.\n\n\"They have both brought a lot to the table this year. They have played extremely well” Quenneville said of Trouba and Kreider and their vast wealth of big-game experience. “They come to play hard and it's appreciated. Trouba has logged way more minutes than we would have thought early in the year and Kreids gives us that netfront presence that was lacking last year.”\n\nAs far as the invariable emotional swirl that comes on a night wearing opposing colors on Garden ice for the former Rangers – particularly Kreider who also played 123 playoff games (with 48 goals) as a Ranger – the veteran coach knows what to expect.\n\n“Internally I’m sure they can’t wait to get this one started,’’ he said. “Fans here are great. They are supportive in a lot of ways and I’m sure it will be special for them. It’s a meaningful game for us too … I’m sure both teams will be excited to play this game.”\n\nAllan Kreda is a New York-area sportswriter with bylines at The Associated Press and formerly of the New York Times.",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Niky Sal, an influencer leading an effort to catch alleged child predators online in Western New York, was hospitalized after being stabbed in his latest encounter in Jamestown.\n\nWIVB News 4 sat down with Niky earlier this month after footage of an earlier encounter at the Walden Galleria in Cheektowaga went viral on social media.\n\nThe effort’s like a modern-day version of the old reality show, “To Catch a Predator.” Alongside his associates, Paul Oyer and Ethan Haskins, Niky operates undercover on social media posing as underage children in an attempt to catch adults who prey upon minors.\n\n“What we do is we have decoy accounts,” Niky said in an earlier interview with News 4. “We kind of just have them there, and we never send the first message. Nine times out of 10, once that first message is sent, it goes downhill very quick, especially once we age-drop and they know how old the minor is.”\n\nNiky explained in our interview earlier this month how this effort, for him, is personal.\n\n“When I was 9 years old I was a victim,” Niky said at the time. “I guess that kind of drove me to do what I do today.”\n\nOn Saturday, things took a violent turn after Niky and his team met up with a man in Jamestown who they say believed he was there to meet a 14-year-old girl.\n\nNiky suffered a large laceration to his arm and ended up in the hospital.\n\n“He was released from the hospital,” Oyers said. “We got back home, and he couldn’t move his fingers, couldn’t move his hand.”\n\nAn artery was severed in the attack, leaving Niky with no feeling in his arm. Now, he needs surgery.\n\n“There’s pretty extensive damage to the arm where he was got,” Haskins said. “We’re kind of worried about that, mobility and things.”\n\nJames Morris, 43, was arrested in connection with the incident on several charges, including first-degree assault, according to Jamestown Police. He was arraigned and remanded to the Chautauqua County Jail.\n\nNow, moving forward, Niky’s team says, while the road to recovery might end up being a long one, once Niky’s back on his feet, there won’t be any slowing him down.\n\n“When we saw him last night at the hospital, at this time there isn’t any signs of it slowing him down, it stopping him,” Haskins said. “We got to get through this recovery thing, and then it’s hit the ground running and keep going and fighting the good fight.”\n\nA gofundme page has been set up to help with medical expenses as Niky continues to recover from his injuries.\n\nRob Petree is an anchor and reporter who joined the News 4 team in 2025.

    "fullText": "The New York Jets barely showed up on Sunday in a disgraceful display of football ineptitude. The Jacksonville Jaguars moved the ball at will against a no show Jets defense. The game turned into a rout early. It was over by halftime, with the second half functioning as extended garbage time. The Jaguars were so dominant they pulled their starters early in the fourth quarter as they cruised to a 48 – 20 blowout victory over a lifeless and seemingly disinterested Jets team. With the Jets eliminated from playoff contention, a large and growing list of injured players, and many of the remaining players looking like they have checked out for the season, these last three games are likely to be rough sledding.\n\nNext week the Jets go on the road to face a 4-10 New Orleans Saints team that has shown some life of late, winning three of their last five games, including a season sweep of the Carolina Panthers. The Saints are not a good football team, but they seem to be improving, and they certainly have not matched the Jets’ level of ineptitude lately.\n\nLet’s take a look at the current odds for this game according to FanDuel Sportsbook. The current line has the Jets road underdogs by 4.5 points. The game has an over/under of 40.5 points. On the moneyline the Jets are +176 and the Jaguars are -210. It is a mark of the depths to which the Jets have fallen that they are substantial underdogs to a Saints team that has scored more than 19 points just three times all year.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A JetBlue flight from the small Caribbean nation of Curaçao halted its ascent to avoid colliding with a U.S. Air Force refueling tanker on Friday, and the pilot blamed the military plane for crossing his path.\n\n“We almost had a midair collision up here,” the JetBlue pilot said, according to a recording of his conversation with air traffic control. “They passed directly in our flight path. ... They don’t have their transponder turned on, it’s outrageous.”\n\nThe incident involved JetBlue Flight 1112 from Curaçao, which is just off the coast of Venezuela, en route to New York City's JFK airport. It comes as the U.S. military has stepped up its drug interdiction activities in the Caribbean and is also seeking to increase pressure on Venezuela's government.\n\n“We just had traffic pass directly in front of us within 5 miles of us — maybe 2 or 3 miles — but it was an air-to air-refueler from the United States Air Force and he was at our altitude,” the pilot said. “We had to stop our climb.” The pilot said the Air Force plane then headed into Venezuelan air space.\n\nDerek Dombrowski, a spokesman for JetBlue, said Sunday: “We have reported this incident to federal authorities and will participate in any investigation.\" He added, “Our crewmembers are trained on proper procedures for various flight situations, and we appreciate our crew for promptly reporting this situation to our leadership team.”\n\nThe Pentagon referred The Associated Press to the Air Force for comment. The Air Force didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration last month issued a warning to U.S. aircraft urging them to “exercise caution” when in Venezuelan airspace, “due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela.”\n\nAccording to the air traffic recording, the controller responded to the pilot, “It has been outrageous with the unidentified aircraft within our air.”",

    "title": "2026 NFL Draft Order: NY Giants still hold No. 1 overall pick",
    "description": "The NY Giants hold the No.1 pick after their eighth consecutive loss.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants suffered a frustrating 29-21 loss to the Washington Commanders on Sunday as they returned from their bye week. As a result, the Giants continued to hold the No.1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThere were some flashes, like Abdul Carter having a breakout game, big plays from tight ends Daniel Bellinger and Theo Johnson, DB Dru Phillips, and RB Tyrone Tracy. But there were simply too many miscues and missed opportunities to overcome with late magic. But ultimately it was too little, too late for the Giants and their frantic comeback fell short.\n\nThe loss also highlighted the shortcomings of the Giants’ roster, as the receivers consistently failed to get open, once again forcing Jaxson Dart to hold the ball or take a big hit when scrambling, and struggled to hang onto the ball when they did find separation. This was also (probably) Jermaine Eluemunor’s worst game of the season, as he struggled against veteran pass rusher Von Miller, and the Giants struggled to consistently move the ball in short-yardage situations on the ground.\n\nThe Giants’ eighth-consecutive loss comes one day after Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThat brings us to the upside of the loss for the Giants: there are a number of quarterback-needy teams in the Top 10 of the draft, and it’s possible that Mendoza will be the only highly-regarded quarterback to come out this year. That could make the first overall pick highly valuable if teams like the New York Jets, Las Vegas Raiders, Cleveland Browns, and New Orleans Saints are all vying for the top quarterback prospect.\n\nNobody wants to see the Giants lose, but trading the first overall pick could net valuable assets to fill multiple holes in the first two or three rounds. The Giants could use a highly-drafted receiver as well as a long-term answer at right tackle. Likewise, the Giants need a long-term answer at right guard and an infusion of youth and athleticism at linebacker.\n\nMost early mock drafts have the Giants drafting a wide receiver or an offensive tackle with their first pick. A sizeable haul of picks could allow them to address both positions with high picks, as well as add one of the talented linebackers or defensive backs in this class.\n\nIt remains to be seen who will make that pick, but the Giants could have a tremendous amount of capital to go with a young roster.\n\nThe Giants’ road to the first overall pick is a tight one. They share a 2-12 record with the Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders (who they play in two weeks). The Jets, Browns, and Arizona Cardinals are also each a game out of the first pick at 3-11, though the Saints managed to beat the Carolina Panthers and improve to 4-10 on the season.\n\nNew York still has games against the Minnesota Vikings, the afore-mentioned Raiders, and the Dallas Cowboys to end the season. They remain a team that can compete with any in the NFL, as well as lose to any in the NFL, so no outcome between 1st and 10th overall is out of the question.",

Among the casualties was Rabbi Eli Schlanger, the assistant rabbi at the Chabad of Bondi, a Chabad official told the New York Times.\n\n“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy,” said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. He added: “An attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian.”\n\nThe two shooters were a 50-year-old man who was fatally shot by police and a 24-year-old man who suffered “critical injuries,” police said.\n\nGunfire was heard on the popular beachfront around 6:47 p.m. local time Sunday, authorities said. Witnesses told the Daily Mail that they saw two men exit a vehicle close to the waterfront and begin firing dozens of rounds at beachgoers.\n\nNSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said that more than 1,000 people were at the Hannukkah event at Archer Park on the northern end of the beach when the shooting took place. “As a result of the circumstances of the incident tonight, at 9:36 p.m. this evening, I declared this to be a terrorist incident,” Lanyon said.\n\nFootage widely shared on social media shows a bystander tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the weapon from his hands, and then turning it back on him, forcing the attacker to retreat.\n\n“It’s the most unbelievable scene I’ve ever seen,” NSW Premier Chris Minns said in a late-night press conference. “Walking to a gunman… and singlehandedly disarming him, putting his own life at risk... that man is a genuine hero and I’ve got no doubt there are many, many people alive due to his bravery.\"\n\nExtraordinary vision reportedly taken from the scene of the Bondi Beach shooting appears to a show a man heroically tackling and disarming one of the shooters.\n\nVision circulating social media shows an unidentified bystander approaching the gunman, who had just discharged his… pic.twitter.com/GJIRYJcD0W\n\n— 10 News (@10NewsAU) December 14, 2025\n\nThe hero bystander was identified by relatives as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed.

He’s a hero 100 percent.”\n\nIn separate footage, two men can be seen standing on a passenger bridge while firing multiple shots into the parkland that surrounds the beach.\n\n“This cowardly act of terrifying violence is shocking and painful to see and represents some of our worst fears about terrorism in Sydney,” Minns added.\n\n“This attack was designed to target Sydney’s Jewish community on the first day of Hanukkah, what should have been a night of peace and joy celebrated in that community with families and supporters, has been shattered by this horrifying, evil attack.”\n\nBondi is an area of the city with a large Jewish population, and Sunday marks the first day of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.\n\nA “Chanukah by the Sea” event, planned for Sunday, began at 5 p.m. local time on the beach where community members were set to light the first candle on a giant Menorah, enjoy a petting farm, and receive free face painting.\n\n“Join Chabad of Bondi for our Annual Chanukah Festival as We Celebrate Jewish Life by lighting up the Iconic Bondi Beach,” the event information page reads.\n\n“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added at the press conference. “This is an act of evil antisemitism terrorism that has struck the heart of our nation.”\n\n“Every Australian tonight will be like me, devastated over this attack on our way of life. There is no place for this hate, violence and terrorism in our nation. Let me be clear, we will eradicate it.”\n\nTension between community groups has been increasingly strained in Australia following the outbreak of the war in Gaza in 2023.\n\nSydney has been the site of numerous pro-Palestine protests, including one demonstration in August that saw an estimated 90-300,000 people march across the famous Harbour Bridge.\n\n“The events at Bondi Beach are an absolute atrocity. A horror for the victims and a massive escalation of the hatred directed at Australia’s Jewish community,” former conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbot said on X.\n\n“There should be no place in Australia for the kind of evil we’ve seen this evening,” he added. “Thank God one bystander heroically intervened showing the good side of our country.”\n\nBondi Beach is one of the world’s most iconic beaches and a central hub of Sydney life. With close proximity to the CBD, a vibrant community, and world-class surf, this waterfront neighbourhood is known for its luxury properties and upper-class living.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the beach was packed with holidaymakers and locals cooling off in the water from the 90-degree heat when the shooting began.\n\nVideo footage of the incident shows hundreds of people sprinting across the white sand for cover as shots ring out in the background.\n\nWitnesses say dozens of shots were fired, while other imagery shows bullets and casings from high-powered rifle weaponry on the floor.\n\n“For twenty minutes, they shoot, shoot. Change magazines and just shoot,” one Israeli eyewitness told a 7 News journalist who was on the scene.\n\n“It’s terrible. In the middle of Bondi. It’s terrible.”\n\nThis community is no stranger to tragedy. The Bondi neighborhood was the subject of a mass stabbing incident in April of last year, with six people stabbed to death and 12 people injured at the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping centre. That incident was not considered a terror attack.\n\nMass shootings are rare in Australia following the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania in 1996 in which 35 people were shot dead and a further 23 wounded. In the immediate aftermath of that event, then Prime Minister John Howard implemented a mandatory firearm buyback scheme which saw 650,000 newly prohibited firearms removed from circulation in Australia.",

    "fullText": "Victor Wembanyama made a triumphant return from injury to lead the San Antonio Spurs to a stunning NBA Cup semi-final upset of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday as the New York Knicks downed the Orlando Magic to book their place in the final.\n\nFrench prodigy Wembanyama, who has missed the Spurs' last 12 games after suffering a left calf strain last month, produced a dominant performance at both ends of the court to set up a thrilling 111-109 victory at Las Vegas's T-Mobile Arena.\n\nThe 7ft 4in (2.24m) 21-year-old finished with 22 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in 21 minutes on court, helping the Spurs climb out of a 16-point hole in the second quarter to inflict only the second Oklahoma City defeat this season.\n\nNBA champions Oklahoma City had gone into the game on the back of a 16-game winning streak, boasting a 24-1 record for the season that had prompted talk of them breaking Golden State's record 73-win season.\n\nBut after making a smooth start to control the game, Wembanyama began to make his presence felt off the bench in the second quarter to breathe new life into the San Antonio ranks.\n\n\"I knew I had limited minutes so I had to make the most out of it,\" Wembanyama said.\n\n\"Winning against a team like this, it might seem like it's just a game but it's a collective effort and it's not an easy thing.\n\n\"It's only their second loss of the season. It means something.\"\n\nWembanyama was one of four San Antonio players to finish with double figures, with Devin Vassell scoring 23, and Stephon Castle and De'Aaron Fox adding 22 apiece.\n\n\"It says a lot. And it says a lot about where this team is going to be in the future,\" he said.\n\nReigning NBA Most Valuable Player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder scoring with 29 points, while Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren added 17 points each.\n\nIn Saturday's other semi-final, Jalen Brunson scored 40 points to power the New York Knicks to their first NBA Cup final with a 132-120 win over the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe Knicks' in-form offense proved too hot for injury-hit Orlando as New York took their recent streak to nine wins from 10 games.\n\n\"We came out here and did exactly what we said we wanted to do, which was play Knicks basketball,\" said Karl-Anthony Towns, who backed Brunson with 29 points.\n\nThe Magic had led 36-33 after making a rapid start to a breathless opening quarter -- earning the Knicks players some harsh and fiery words from coach Mike Brown in an early timeout.\n\n\"The way they came out, physicality-wise, we weren't ready for it,\" said Brunson.\n\n\"We bounced back and responded to that, and the way we played the rest of the game is a testament to that first timeout.\"\n\nNew York went on a tear at the start of the second quarter, capitalizing on a missed floating jump shot from Desmond Bane to take the lead through Josh Hart.\n\nThe Knicks briefly relinquished their advantage soon after half-time, when Bane put the Magic back ahead with a running layup.\n\nBut Orlando ultimately could not keep pace with Brunson, who late in the third quarter left opposing guard Anthony Black sitting helplessly on the floor before executing a three-point step-back jumpshot.\n\nOrlando's Jalen Suggs managed a team-high 26 points, but failed to complete the game after suffering with an apparent injury to his left side.\n\nThe Magic also felt the absence of Franz Wagner, their leading scorer this season.\n\nThe NBA Cup, a mid-season knockout tournament now in its third year, is proving a hit with audiences and players.\n\nIt now offers a tantalizing opportunity for the Knicks to win their first overall trophy since 1973.",

Miller scored his second goal of the game on a power play at 2:56 of overtime as the New York Rangers rallied to beat the Montreal Canadiens 5-4 on Saturday night.\n\nWill Cuylle, Noah Laba and Artemi Panarin also scored to help the Rangers snap a three-game skid (0-1-2).

    "title": "New York Giants mailbag: Joe Schoen, Brandon Brown, next coach, more",
    "description": "The mail’s here! And, the mailbag is again overflowing.",
    "fullText": "Jeffrey Jacobs asks: Hope you were able to enjoy a Giants-free weekend. I have another Joe Schoen question. Could you give us a peak behind the curtain as to how the Giants divide responsibilities between Schoen and his assistant GM Brandon Brown? What exactly does the Assistant GM do – is he like the Vice President who basically sits around and waits for the President to give him a task, or does he have a specific area of responsibility? While watching the train wreck that was ‘Hard Knocks’ last year, I came away impressed with Brown and have thought that if/when Schoen gets fired the Giants might just promote Brown to the top spot which would insure some level of continuity (arguably that might not be as good thing, but that’s a whole other question). I do feel that Joe Schoen needs to go, with his biggest failure being an almost criminal lack of depth on the roster – as soon as a starter goes down, that unit is basically doomed.\n\nEd says: Jeffrey, I don’t know the nitty-gritty details of what Brown does every day. I know that when Schoen was hired by the Giants he credited Buffalo Bills GM Brandon Beane with preparing him for the job by letting him on every aspect of it, not hiding any information from him or keeping him from learning every piece of the GM role. He promised to do the same for Brown.\n\nWhen he was hired, Brown described his job this way:\n\nWith the Giants, Brown described his job in two words: “football solutions.”\n\n“It’s overseeing the pro personnel department, the college scouting department and also just being the checks and balances with Joe on the football operations side,” Brown said.\n\nBrown takes part in all of the major decision-making discussions. He makes a lot of scouting trips, sometimes with Schoen and sometimes without him. He has a voice in everything, he just doesn’t get to make any of the final decisions.\n\nDennis Norton asks: If the decision is made to replace Joe Schoen, why not Brandon Brown? Brown has interviewed for other GM positions in the past and is seen as an up and comer. Brown’s elevation would not disrupt the this year’s scouting process and would provide for an easier transition to a new regime. I realize the argument against Brown is that he may be part of the problem. However, his experience as Assistant GM and time spent with the Eagles lead me to believe that his time has come. Elevate him and let him be part of the process to hire a new Coach. Your thoughts?\n\nEd says: Dennis, that is a natural question. Brown has gotten some interviews for other general manager openings.\n\nYou actually, though, answered your own question. We don’t know how much influence Brown has had on many of the biggest decisions that have been made the past few years. What has he agreed with? What has he not agreed with? What would he have done differently? Maybe ownership knows the answer because Brown does have a voice in the organization and is involved.\n\nIf ownership feels Brown would have made some different decisions in the past, and is better-suited to be the decision-maker going forward, fine. But, we can’t know for sure he is or isn’t “part of the problem,” to use your words.\n\nJohn Fritz asks: My question is with JS future uncertain with the Giants if there are or aren’t any moves during their bye week be it player extensions or any additions, would that tip where ownership is leaning?\n\nEd says: John, I don’t think anything that did or did not happen during the bye week gives us any insight. I think that what happens over the final four weeks, when the Giants don’t play a single team that has a winning record, will be something that might weigh into ownership’s thinking. Especially if the Giants don’t win a couple of those games.\n\nGino P. asks: You explained well why the hit on Olszewski was not a helmet to helmet penalty.  My question is if that WAS called a penalty, would that override the turnover?  I have not seen that situation arise in a game before.\n\nEd says: This is a good question. As I often do with rules questions, I turned to Cyd Ziegler of Outsports.com for clarification. Cyd has refereed games at the high school and college levels.\n\n“Yes, the offense keeps the ball. The offense may need to accept the penalty – which they obviously would – and the enforcement spot would be the spot of the foul, given it was during a “running play.” I’m not sure there’s a specific “if the fumble is caused by a foul the fouled team keeps it,” but if you think about it, a foul before the change of possession… everything that happens after that foul is moot as long as the penalty is accepted.”\n\nSo, had a penalty been called the Giants would have maintained possession.\n\nRobert Forgione asks: How much can Schoen and the ownership “search” for a new coach as the season is still going on. I thought you could only talk to coaches that were eliminated from playoffs or on a bye? What exactly are they doing if not able to talk to potential coaches.\n\nEd says: Robert, interviews with candidates already employed by other teams cannot be conducted until after the season or during designated windows during the playoffs. That is correct. That doesn’t mean back-channel calls to intermediaries, like agents, can’t be made to get an idea who might or might not be interested in the job. It also doesn’t mean some vetting of people you might have interest in can’t occur.\n\nEdward McGowan asks: In listening and watching the Giants’ games this year, I heard a lot about how Dexter Lawrence has faced a double team in over 70% of the plays he has been involved with. I never gave it much thought. Then, I watched how Steve Spagnuolo schemed to get Chris Jones single covered and basically take over the second half of the game for the Kansas City Chiefs. OK, the Chiefs didn’t win but Jones was dominant. Is this a failure of the defensive coordinator? Standing by and letting the other team take away your best defensive player or did Bowen think this was a good use of Lawrence. I know Dexter was much better last year and he was probably double-teamed just as much, but it seems to me this is a clear indictment of Bowen’s inability to leverage the pieces of his defense. I know he’s gone, but Monday night made me resent him all over again.\n\nCan we expect to see any changes in scheme that might light a spark on the defensive side or it too late in the season to change what has been baked into Bowen’s defensive strategy?\n\nEd says: Edward, the only thing I can say is I guess we will find out over the next four weeks. Interim defensive coordinator Charlie Bullen can’t throw everything out and install a new scheme. He can turn to some unused pages in the playbook and call things differently than Bowen did. He showed a willingness to do that against the Patriots, dialing up some blitz packages and efforts to disguise coverages or who was/was not rushing that we did not see from Bowen.\n\nCan he create more one-on-one opportunities for Lawrence? It will certainly help if Kayvon Thibodeaux comes back and Abdul Carter starts making the kind of plays he was drafted to make. Those developments might force offense to make more decisions about allocating blocking resources.\n\nOne thing about Chris Jones is that he is much smaller than Lawrence, which gives the Chiefs the ability to align him in more places than the Giants can align Lawrence. Kansas City has used Jones as an edge or defensive end more than 200 times this season. I don’t think you can do that with a 350-pound man.\n\nChristopher Trappe asks: Given your journalistic experience covering the Giants, your proximity to the team and your knowledge of Giants operations, do you think the 2025 Giants are better than last year’s team?\n\nEd says: Christopher, I think they should have been better. I think the pieces were, and in many ways still are, there for them to be better. I think all the blown double-digit leads they have blown tell you the opportunity was there for them to be better.\n\nI think, though, that Jermaine Eluemunor’s answer to this question was the right one.\n\n“2-11 sucks, period. I’m not going to look at this record and be like, yeah, we’re 2-11 now, we’re 2-11 last year but it’s different. No, it’s not different. It’s the same. We’re 2-11,” Eluemunor said earlier this week. “Like, you did things last year that got you to 2-11. We did things this year that got us to 2-11. I can say that our play is different. We’re in close games, but we didn’t finish those games. I’m not the type of cherry-pick at things and look at the positives. I’m a positive guy by nature, but at the same time we are 2-11 still. So, obviously there’s a lot of things for us to improve as a team and me individually, but there’s no cherry-picking at the record. I feel like that’s kind of like a losing mentality to be like, oh yeah, let’s look at this, look at that. No, we’re 2-11.”\n\nDon Barone asks: Just want to get your opinion on the head coach search. Many are saying two things I disagree with. One, that it needs to be an offensive minded coach to develop Jaxon Dart. Two that Dart or any other player should have a big say on who the choice should be. I couldn’t disagree more. I think it should be a CEO type to oversee the entire operation. Discipline and structure top my list. Let the OC and QB coach develop Dart. Two, the inmates are already running the asylum.  Please let the qualified people within the front office and ownership make the right choice. I get it that they’re hard to trust but they are more qualified than a 22-year-old player who’s been with the team for nine months.\n\nEd says: Don, where did this idea come from that Jaxson Dart is going to get to pick his next head coach? I know that isn’t fully what you are saying, but it seems to be what some fans think.\n\nDart has been an NFL player for less than a year. He has won TWO games. In no way is he picking the next head coach. Now, how the next head coach fits with Dart, whether or not he is all-in on Dart as the guy to build around, what his plan is for developing Dart and running an offense with him at the center of it, is critically important. Dart is the biggest piece of the Giants’ puzzle.\n\nFinding the right head coach is not about which side of the ball he comes from. It is about whether he can lead men. Can he put a structure in place and hold players to a standard? Does he understand the kind of football the Giants have always won with? Can he excite quality assistant coaches and get them to come work for him?\n\nEd Helinski asks: What should Santa bring the Giants this Christmas? And who might be in line for coal in their stocking?\n\nEd says: Ed, it will be a late Christmas present but the Giants should hope Santa brings them the right head coach. Oh, and good health news for John Mara.\n\nCoal in their stocking? The easy answer is Eagles fans.\n\nRoger Mazone asks: Giant 2026 Draft Needs?\n\nThe Giants have many holes to fill going into next season, many of these needs outside of the quarterback position, are the same needs the Giants had last year. On defense, a defensive tackle to aid Dexter Lawerence to help the run defense, more athletic inside linebackers for the same purpose, and help on the backend with a topflight cornerback.\n\nOn offense we need a 1B/2 WR (not sure how effective Nabers will be coming off a major injury especially early next season) and an interior offensive lineman/guard to compete with Van Roten. Also, the Giants need a new placekicker for the 2026 season.\n\nObviously, some of these needs can be met on the free agent market, but the GM hasn’t had a stellar record with free agent acquisitions on defense.\n\nWhat positions would you prioritize in the draft based on this large requirement list?\n\nEd says: Roger, I think it is too early to set priorities in any type of order.\n\nIt is apparent that on offense the Giants are likely to need wide receiver and interior offensive line help. They might need tackle help, too, if they decide not to pay Jermaine Eluemunor.\n\nOn defense, they need help everywhere except edge. Defensive line, off-ball linebacker, cornerback, safety if the right one is available.\n\nAll of this, though, is putting the cart before the horse. We don’t know who the coach will be. We don’t know if there will be a new GM. Thus, we don’t know what the decision-makers will think of the existing roster, and how deeply they will cut into it.\n\nAlso, as you said, free agency comes first. The priorities will shift based on what happens in that market.\n\nJason Brown asks: I notice that some players may be considered a ‘bust’ while with one team, then thrive on another team after the original team moves on from them. Is it the fault of coaches on the original team for not being able to tap into the player’s ability or is it really change of scenery in some cases? I’m asking this in the event the Giants move on from Evan Neal and somehow he does well in his eventual landing spot.\n\nEd says: Jason, there is no one size fits all answer to that question. It might be coaching. It might be that a player is just not a fit and does not feel comfortable with a certain team or in a location. Sometimes, a coaching change leads to a player not fitting with the new staff. Sometimes, it is on the player for faulty work habits or lack of maturity. Sometimes a guy accepts a position change to keep his career going in a new location that he might not have been willing to accept from his original team.\n\nI can tell you the Giants are aware they could end up with egg on their faces if Neal goes somewhere else and plays well. But, they tried to make it work for almost four years in New York and it just didn’t.\n\nKen Moskowitz asks: Ed, I’ve been a die hard Giants fan for over 50 years. If a team does not provide the supporting cast around the QB, it doesn’t matter who is back there. Daniel Jones never had the support from both coaching and personnel to give him a chance to be successful. The decision to keep Daboll after he treated Daniel Jokes the way he did shows a lack of leadership by both ownership and the GM. This organization has taken a turn in the wrong direction from all levels. What is your thoughts as to what really needs to happen to get them back on track?\n\nEd says: Ken, I hate to oversimplify this but they need the right coach. They need a guy who is going to set an standard, hold players accountable, build a clear identity and be there for 8-10 years to establish some consistency.\n\nWhen you keep changing … and changing … and changing some more you don’t get where you want to go. You just keep going back to the beginning and starting over.\n\nLawrence Kenney asks: I’ve continued to read the commentary about changing Dart’s style of play, but I’m of the opinion that there’s only so much that can be done in season\n\nDuring the offseason, whoever is coach should mandate that Dart watch tape of Patrick Mahomes. He is, arguably, the best quarterback in the league and has a tremendous talent for knowing when to slide and/or step out of bounds without significant contact.\n\nEd says: Lawrence, if you have listened to Dart speak he is already well aware of Mahomes’ play style. He has already spent considerable time studying Mahomes and other top quarterbacks.\n\nI worry about Dart’s future, but I quite honestly think that the narrative around him has jumped the shark and is really becoming a lot of noise. Yes, everybody would like to see him choose to protect himself a little more often. But, do you want all the constant headlines and chipring about his play style to change who he is, to make him hesitant, to take away the competitiveness and play-making ability that can make him special?\n\nHe is a 22-year-old kid. He will learn. As his career moves along, he will run less often. He will gain more understanding of what plays he can and cannot make. Hopefully, the Giants will also continue to build around him so he doesn’t feel he needs to do so much by himself.\n\nChris Butters asks: I think we can all agree the season is over, and Kafka probably isn’t getting the H/C gig.\n\nIn your opinion is there now some merit to giving rookie/2nd year players some game time to see what we’ve got? I was thinking about Mbow and Alexander specifically.\n\nEd says: Chris, this “play the young players” stuff is a typical narrative at the end of a losing season. Tell me, though, aside from Marcus Mbow what young player who should be playing is not already getting significant snaps?\n\nThe quarterback is a rookie. Darius Alexander, a third-round pick, sees significant snaps most weeks. Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo are hurt. John Michael Schmitz, Tyrone Tracy, Abdul Carter, Cor’Dale Flott, Tyler Nubin, Deonte Banks, Dane Belton, Dru Phillips, and Korie Black are all getting a lot of playing time. Micah McFadden and Darius Muasau are hurt.\n\nAs for Mbow, that is a tricky one. Jermaine Eluemunor is having an outstanding season. If you bench him now to “see what you have” in Mbow, I can almost guarantee that Eluemunor will sign elsewhere in the offseason. If that is the outcome you want, fine. But, you have to understand that. Eluemunor is a proud man who has fought through a lot to become a very good NFL right tackle. If you insult him, there will be plenty of other teams happy to have him at right tackle.\n\nCan Mbow play guard? Maybe in the long term, but I have no idea if he has being taking guard reps in practice. He is small for a guard, just 300 pounds, and the reality that his play strength was a question even before the draft indicates he would need to add bulk and strength to play in there.\n\nSo, again, what young players aren’t already getting significant opportunities?\n\nDouglas Furth asks: If Phillip Rivers is not on the Hall of Fame ballot this year, does that improve Eli’s chances?\n\nEd says: Douglas, I wish I believed it did. No one will ever convince me that Eli Manning does not belong in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. If the playoffs and Super Bowl are more important than the regular season, which they are, what Manning did when given an opportunity in the postseason must be weighted more heavily than perceived regular season mediocrity.\n\nI don’t think that Rivers, if he ends up on the Indianapolis Colts’ 53-man roster, being off the ballot is going to matter. Drew Brees is on the ballot, and I can almost guarantee Brees will get more support than Manning. With the limited number of players enshrined each year (four to eight) I seriously doubt two quarterbacks would be voted in.\n\nRonald Buchheim asks: Koo claimed the ball was wobbling so he pulled up and didn’t kick. Let’s disregard the fact that the ball was ultimately stable after wobbling slightly. Why didn’t this highly experienced professional attempt the kick regardless of the ball’s motion? Doesn’t he understand that a poor kick is better than no kick at all? Isn’t he coached on what to do in this common situation? Did anyone ask him or his coach about this? Is it another reason, along with the other special team failures last week, to fire yet another coach?\n\nEd says: Ronald, if you watch the play back you clearly see that the hold by Jamie Gillan was not clean.\n\nYounghoe Koo 😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/09zQTT2CMf\n\n— Kenny Powers (@k3nnyp0w3rs) December 2, 2025\n\nNow, should Younghoe Koo followed through and kicked the ball, anyway? Probably. It looked ridiculous and Gillan ended up with a knee injury that to the end result.\n\nNow, as far as firing Michael Ghobrial I do hope you have calmed down since you sent this question. The Giants special teams have, for the most part been really good this season. The placekicker issue is not on Ghobrial, and the Week 13 game was not good overall.\n\nAll NFL teams absolutely practice what to do in situations like this. There are several things that could happen. Ghobrial addressed the play with Koo this week. Here is what he said\n\n“It doesn’t happen very often, but you do see missed snaps, you do see missed holds, and sometimes there’s just a variety of different outcomes when it comes to that. Sometimes the kicker sees that the ball is replaced and is able to kick through it. Sometimes they kick through it and it hits the o-linemen in the back of the head because it’s not placed the proper way. Sometimes there’s a fire drill where they’re obviously trying to just throw the pass and sometimes guys just dirt the ball. So, it does happen.”\n\nBob Conyea asks: How important do you feel it is for the next Giants head coach to have prior head coaching experience? The coordinator route seems to be very hit and miss. Some of these guys are great with the x’s and o’s but they lack the ability to run the whole program and often show little interest or ability with the “other side of the ball” (Daboll). In military parlance, good staff officers don’t necessarily make good commanders. Isn’t that ability perhaps one of the more important traits that Mike Kafka must demonstrate in his stint as interim head coach? The Giants need a leader more than they need a thinker.\n\nEd says: Bob, I fully agree that leadership — the ability to get dozens of well-paid men with fairly substantial egos to buy in to your message, to be accountable and toe the line of the standard you set, is more important than ability to scheme offense or defense.\n\nIt might be easier to know if a veteran coach does or does not have that ability. It does not, though, mean a first-time coach can’t have it. Bill Parcells had it. Dan Campbell has it. Sean McVay has it.\n\nBoth avenues can be hit and miss. To me, though, the leadership aspect is more important than the Xs and Os aspect.\n\nHave a Giants-related question?

    "title": "War of the words: Why Luigi Mangione's evidence hearing is more than a fight over a backpack",
    "description": "A fight over words like \"execution,\" \"manifesto\" and \"Faraday\" is the undercard bout at Luigi Mangione's ongoing evidence-suppression hearing in NYC.",
    "fullText": "Yes, it's a fight over a backpack — how it was seized, how it was searched, and whether the gun and notebook found inside will be tossed or kept as knockout-blow evidence in a future murder trial.\n\nBut Luigi Mangione's ongoing evidence suppression hearing, playing out for two weeks in a Manhattan courtroom, is more than that.\n\nThe serious legal battle features an often amusing undercard bout: repeated sparring over nothing more than the naming of things.\n\nWas UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson shot on a Midtown sidewalk last year? Or was he \"executed?\"\n\nIs the red notebook found inside Mangione's backpack a \"manifesto,\" or a \"journal?\"\n\nAnd is the aluminum-lined pouch found in Mangione's backpack a \"Faraday bag,\" meant to block his cellphone from being tracked during a five-day manhunt? Or was the bag simply \"waterproof?\"\n\nIt all depends on who is standing at the courtroom's podium: lead defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo or top prosecutor Joel Seidemann.\n\nThese pretrial rhetorical rumbles foreshadow how intensely these two adversaries — seasoned legal veterans with decadeslong experience — will fight next year, at a yet-scheduled trial in the same state-level courtroom.\n\nThe temperament of the judge is also being previewed. NY Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro has alternated between seeming mildly irked and utterly unfazed as he's refereed these sporadic wars of words over the past two weeks.\n\n\"Move on,\" Carro has said when the prosecutor and defense lawyer complain about each other — like when Friedman Agnifilo stood up on Thursday to say of Seidemann, \"He wants to play the word 'manifesto' over and over and over again!\"\n\nCarro's relative calm has only wavered once, on Monday, after the prosecutor repeatedly referred to Thompson's murder as an \"execution.\"\n\n\"You testified you were aware of the New York City shooting?\" prior to the arrest, Friedman Agnifilo had asked the third Altoona, Pennsylvania, cop to take the stand. (Mangione was arrested in a McDonald's there five days after Thompson's December 4, 2024, shooting, after being spotted by customers.) \"You were aware it did not involve a bomb?\" she asked, scoring a point.\n\n\"Were you aware it involved a premeditated execution?\" Seidemann clapped back minutes later, visibly eager to take that point back.\n\nThe judge's voice was sharp as he sustained Friedman Agnifilo's objection. Soon afterward, she stood to complain about the prosecutor's repeated references to \"manifesto\" and \"the execution of Mr. Thompson.\"\n\n\"He certainly won't do that at trial,\" the judge warned.\n\n\"I'll bear that in mind, your honor,\" the prosecutor answered.\n\nA small \"Faraday bag,\" featuring a protective lining that blocks electronic signals, triggered an extended semantic skirmish on Tuesday.\n\nBoth the lawyer and the prosecutor were asking a lot of questions at the time, about this one little pouch. The size of a business envelope, it held an Apple cellphone, Mangione's passport, and a small wallet with a driver's license and three charge cards inside.\n\nIn questioning the officer who first pulled it out of the backpack, Friedman Agnifilo referred to the pouch as \"a black bag that has Velcro.\"\n\nShe also called it a \"waterproof bag,\" noting that other items in the backpack had been damp that day. (The same cop had testified that inside the backpack she'd found a gun clip filled with nine hollow-point rounds — wrapped in a pair of gray underwear that was \"soaking wet.\")\n\nWeren't electronics and a passport \"items that you'd want to keep dry?\" Friedman Agnifilo asked. \"Yes,\" the officer answered.\n\n\"Is that a Faraday bag or a waterproof bag?\" the prosecutor asked on his next turn at the podium, pointing to an image of the pouch.\n\n\"It's a Faraday bag,\" the cop answered.\n\n\"And how do you distinguish a Faraday bag from a waterproof bag?\" Seidemann pursued.\n\n\"This bag had an aluminum lining,\" the cop answered.\n\n\"If we can continue,\" he then said, turning toward the audience with a slight smile.\n\nMangione's evidence suppression hearing is scheduled to conclude next week. The judge has yet to say when he will rule on the admissibility of the backpack and its contents.\n\nThe Baltimore native is challenging the admissibility of evidence in both his state and federal murder prosecutions. Trial dates have yet to be set in both cases.",

    "description": "A lack of lounges has long been JetBlue's glaring weak spot, but BlueHouse represents the airline's greater push to elevate its premium offering.",
    "fullText": "JetBlue Airways has finally added the one premium perk it's been missing for years.\n\nCome December 18, the low-cost carrier will open its first-ever airport lounge — a two-story, art-deco-inspired retreat called BlueHouse — at its New York-JFK Terminal 5 home base.\n\nA lack of lounges has long been JetBlue's glaring weak spot, but BlueHouse represents JetBlue's greater push to elevate its premium offerings.\n\nIt complements Mint, the airline's flagship business class, and the new domestic first-class seat set to arrive in 2026.\n\nI toured the 9,000-square-foot BlueHouse ahead of its opening, and it is quintessentially \"New York.\"\n\nThere's colorful artwork — including three pieces created by JetBlue employees — a ceiling mural painted as an ode to Grand Central Terminal, and a help desk adorned with a wall of vintage post office boxes (and they have little surprises inside if you ask).\n\nBlueHouse is a vibe closer to a boutique hotel lobby in Midtown than a traditional airline club. JetBlue envisions this as an exclusive spot to relax with a free drink or to work away from the busy terminal crowds.\n\nCompared to competitors' flashier lounges, the BlueHouse service has no showers or full buffets, which could disappoint some customers.\n\nStill, guests can enjoy complimentary hot and cold quick food like breakfast burritos, sandwiches, parfaits, and salads.\n\nI liked the food, but it's simple, and there are few options to start. It's more of a grab-and-go experience rather than a sit-down. But meal options may expand; JetBlue said a kitchen would open in 2026.\n\nThe lounge also sports social areas, private workspaces, power ports, a full lineup of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks across its two bars and coffee stations, and a dedicated game room for kids or families.\n\nBigger airlines have worked to satisfy their customers with lounges, and JetBlue's entry is erring on the side of small and exclusive.\n\nDuring the media walkthrough, JetBlue's head of loyalty, Ed Pouthier, said access will be intentionally limited at first to avoid overcrowding in the 140-person space. Think roughly the size of an average Trader Joe's.\n\nThe lounge is a perk for JetBlue's executive travelers and a way to entice more travelers to its new credit card. Only transatlantic Mint business class passengers, Mosaic 4 loyalty members (the highest tier of JetBlue's status ladder), and JetBlue Premium credit cardholders can enter. The latter two get one free guest; extra guests cost $39.\n\nNo Blue Basic passengers, which is JetBlue's budget, bare-bones fare, and no domestic Mint business class customers will be allowed in. And there is no reciprocal entry for United MileagePlus elites, despite the airlines' loyalty partnership.\n\n\"We promised ourselves when we came up with the idea that we would never have lines,\" Pouthier said.\n\nHe added that limited-access passes will be available for purchase starting in February for Mosaic 1, 2, and 3 loyalty members, JetBlue Plus and Business cardholders, and non-transatlantic Mint customers.\n\nThese early restrictions appear to be JetBlue's answer to the long queues that have plagued its competitors. It remains to be seen how the queue will look once JetBlue introduces paid access, especially with its smaller capacity.\n\nDelta's SkyClubs, for example, have become known for snaking queues, which prompted the airline to rewrite its own access rules in 2023. United Airlines similarly tightened its Club Lounge access in March by upping the price of membership.\n\nBlueHouse is the first of at least two JetBlue lounges, with Boston expected to follow in 2026. CEO Joanna Geraghty teased a potential Fort Lauderdale location at an industry conference last week.\n\nJetBlue President Marty St. George acknowledged that customers like consistency, but said future lounges depend on whether JetBlue can grow its base of Mosaic elites and premium credit card holders enough to justify the investment.\n\nThe $499-a-year JetBlue Premium credit card — launched in January — is already proving lucrative, with St. George saying JetBlue exceeded its 2025 sign-up goal by roughly 67%.\n\n\"We saw the lounge as being sort of the flagship benefit,\" he said.\n\nJetBlue Premium card benefits also include up to $300 in travel statements, free checked luggage, and access to the global airport lounge network, Priority Pass — a clever way for JetBlue to provide lounge access to more customers without building its own.\n\nBlueHouse is a significant step for JetBlue, finally giving it a stronger foothold in the premium space — and the news comes a day after Southwest Airlines' CEO, Bob Jordan, told CNBC that lounges would be a \"huge, next benefit\" for its customers.\n\nBoth low-cost airlines are trying to catch up to their legacy rivals.\n\nAmerican, Delta, and United operate extensive networks of lounges — sometimes running more than one in the same airport — that are increasingly designed like luxury hotels with full-service restaurants, wellness rooms, and chef-made menus.",

    "description": "Zohran Mamdani, currently a state assemblyman, is set to get a large raise when he takes office as mayor of New York City.",
    "fullText": "Zohran Mamdani is about to get a massive raise — and some swanky new accommodations.\n\nMamdani is set to earn a $258,750 annual salary as New York City mayor, a more than 80% increase from the $142,000 annual salary that he earns as a state assemblyman.\n\nHe's also set to move into Gracie Mansion, the official mayoral residence, where he will not have to pay rent.\n\nIn a statement released this week, Mamdani said the decision to move into Gracie Mansion \"came down to our family's safety and the importance of dedicating all of my focus on enacting the affordability agenda New Yorkers voted for.\"\n\nMamdani will take office on January 1, 2026.\n\nForbes has estimated that the state assemblyman's net worth is about $200,000. He currently lives in a rent-stabilized apartment in Astoria and has said that his monthly rent is $2,300.\n\nOn the one hand, Mamdani's hefty new salary shouldn't be a huge surprise: The demands and responsibilities of managing a city of more than 8 million people are far greater than representing roughly 140,000 people in Queens.\n\nAnd it's not the highest mayoral salary out there: The mayor of San Francisco earns a salary of more than $380,000, while the mayor of Los Angeles earns just over $300,000.\n\nStill, it's far more than the $174,000 annual salary earned by most rank-and-file US senators and House members.\n\nIt's also more than the $223,500 annual salary that House Speaker Mike Johnson earns, or the $246,400 annual salaries of President Donald Trump's cabinet secretaries.\n\nMike Bloomberg, a billionaire, notably declined to accept the full salary during his tenure as mayor from 2002 to 2013, choosing instead to accept a $1 salary.\n\nAlmost every New York City mayor has lived at some point in Gracie Mansion, a two-story home on the Upper East Side overlooking the East River.\n\nThe one exception: Bloomberg, who opted to live in his own mansion a few blocks away on East 79th Street.\n\nThe former mayor even said that his successors shouldn't live in the mansion, but that advice apparently went unheeded: Mayor Bill de Blasio moved into the house in 2014, and Mayor Eric Adams also opted to live there.\n\nThe mayor also receives security protection from the New York City Police Department and has access to benefits available to other city employees, including health insurance.\n\nIn his statement on his impending move out of Astoria, Mamdani said that he and his wife Rama would \"miss much about our home in Astoria,\" including \"cooking dinner side by side in our kitchen, sharing a sleepy elevator ride with our neighbors in the evening, hearing music and laughter vibrate through the walls of the apartment.\"\n\n\"I will be a mayor for the line cooks on Steinway, for the children swinging at Dutch Kills Playground, for the bus riders waiting for the Q101,\" Mamdani said. \"While I may no longer live in Astoria, Astoria will always live inside me and the work I do.\"",

    "description": "Stephen A. Smith forgot the 2020 MLB season was shortened due to Covid-19 when he claimed New York Mets star Pete Alonso was injured and barely played.",
    "fullText": "Stephen A. Smith seemingly forgot the 2020 MLB season was shortened due to Covid-19 when he claimed New York Mets star Pete Alonso was injured and barely played.\n\nOn Wednesday, ESPN’s Jeff Passan announced that Alonso agreed to a five-year, $155 million deal to join the Baltimore Orioles. Alonso, 31, played his first seven seasons in the MLB with the Mets and was considered one of the faces of the franchise.\n\nBREAKING: First baseman Pete Alonso and the Baltimore Orioles are finalizing a five-year, $155 million contract, sources tell ESPN. Alonso leaves the Mets to make a loaded AL East even better.\n\n— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) December 10, 2025\n\nHours later, Smith reacted to the news on The Stephen A. Smith Show. First, he lambasted the Mets for allowing star closer Edwin Diaz to sign with the rival Los Angeles Dodgers. He applied that same criticism to Alonso’s departure.\n\nWhile talking about Alonso’s stats, however, Smith appeared to overlook a vitally important piece of context:\n\nHe’s been in the league about seven years. Let’s look at him, alright? He got injured in year two. So, he hits 53 home runs and 120 RBIs his first year in 2019. Next year, he gets hurt, only played in 57 games. Still smacks 16 home runs, 35 RBIs. Next year, 37 home runs, 94 RBIs. The year after that, 2022, 40 home runs, 131 RBIs.\n\nTo Smith’s credit, he quickly realized his mistake with the 2020 season. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the MLB regular season was only 60 games. With 57 games played, Alonso appeared in nearly every game of that shortened season.\n\n“Actually, 2020 was Covid,” Smith clarified. “I apologize. You gotta remember that, because there was a truncated season because all the stuff that was going on in Covid.”\n\nUnfortunately for Smith, the damage was already done and social media users rushed to roast him for the error.\n\nStephen A Smith said Pete Alonso \"got hurt and only played in 57 games his 2nd season\", when really it was the 60 game shortened COVID season\n\n— Fuzzy (@fuzzyfromyt) December 11, 2025\n\nSAS and @ColinCowherd have made a fortune talking about sports despite knowing nothing about sports. It's legit impressive. https://t.co/sdFldE7oIR\n\n— Funhouse (@BackAftaThis) December 12, 2025\n\nHas anyone ever brought up the fact that these guys are simply on TV so often that it’s actually not shocking at all that they don’t follow sports? https://t.co/ZpAeKvuRDl\n\n— Tim Kalinowski (@TimmyKal12) December 12, 2025\n\nHighest paid sports \"commentator\" in the business btw https://t.co/fN2CvjZbgj\n\n— Dean Kremer Enjoyer (@DK_Enj) December 11, 2025\n\nThis clown is the highest paid employee at ESPN https://t.co/JgIjYkf17t\n\n— cg (@colingreten) December 12, 2025\n\nAnd to think Stephen A. Smith gets paid over $100 million to spew nonsense like this day in and day out, with no pushback from anyone with real power.

    "fullText": "Before Jalen Brunson, Knicks reportedly pulled out all the stops for Kevin Durant originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLong before Jalen Brunson, the New York Knicks swung and missed on countless attempts to lure another superstar to the Big Apple. The Carmelo Anthony-Amar’e Stoudemire days were long gone, and the Kristaps Porzingis era never truly took off.\n\nBack in 2019, the Knicks had a perfect opportunity to make a statement. Kevin Durant was going to be a free agent, and the open secret around the league was that he wanted to move to New York City, where his company had its headquarters.\n\nWith that in mind, Knicks owner James Dolan made sure to get his best people on the job. As revealed by investigative journalist Pablo Torre on his “Pablo Torre Finds Out” podcast, the Knicks actually hired the Wu-Tang Clan to record a recruiting song and video to get the future Hall of Famer on the team.\n\nWu-Tang Clan founding member Method Man confirmed that the legendary hip-hop band was gladly on board with the idea, since they knew Durant wanted to be in New York and they’re all Knicks fans:\n\n“I don’t remember the track, but I remember we shot a visual for it,” Method Man said. \"We really wanted KD to come, and I knew that KD wanted to come to New York. He just wasn't clear on where he wanted to go.\"\n\nThe video, dubbed  \"The Multi-Million Dollar Wu-Tang Clan Music Video Meant for One Person,” showed Wu-Tang Clan members wearing Durant’s Knicks jersey, and it featured an epilogue in which several members of the band made their pitches to lure the two-time NBA champion to Madison Square Garden.\n\nDurant ultimately headed to New York, but he signed with the Brooklyn Nets instead. He teamed up with Kyrie Irving and hoped to take the Eastern Conference by storm, but it didn’t take long before that team imploded.\n\nDespite having a plethora of All-Stars along the way, such as James Harden and then Ben Simmons, injuries and their dysfunctional nature ultimately doomed the Nets, and they’re still trying to work their way back up.\n\nAs for the Knicks, they wound up trading for Jalen Brunson a couple of years later. He’s now become the face of the franchise, and with fellow Villanova stars Mikal Bridges and Josh Hart, plus Karl-Anthony Towns and OG Anunoby, they have one of the strongest teams in the East.\n\nDurant, on the other hand, is now on his third team after leaving Golden State, and he has yet to return to the NBA Finals.",

The real-time 2026 NFL draft order is becoming clearer every week.\n\nThe Jets are slated to possess two first-round picks in 2026, their own and the one originally belonging to the Indianapolis Colts, as a result of the Sauce Gardner blockbuster trade. New York entered the weekend with their own selection at No. 7 overall and it did not change following Sunday's results.\n\nFive 3-10 teams are currently scheduled to own picks 4-8, and head coach Aaron Glenn's squad has the second-best strength of schedule (.541) among that group.\n\nThe Jets stay at No. 7 in the draft order, per ⁦@tankathon⁩ pic.twitter.com/M3Sl1GqZk7\n\n— Brian Costello (@BrianCoz) December 8, 2025\n\nIn better news, the pick originally belonging to the Colts was slated for 23rd overall entering Week 14. Following the Colts' blowout loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, it has improved to No. 21. Starting quarterback Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles injury and Indianapolis fell to third place in the AFC South.\n\nThe Jets still don't own a top-five selection. If quarterbacks Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields aren't able to return following their Week 14 injuries, it's difficult to imagine the Jets winning a game with rookie undrafted QB Brady Cook in the lineup.

    "fullText": "The New York Times said on Wednesday that it would not “be deterred by false and inflammatory language” in response to President Donald Trump’s latest claim that the outlet’s reporting on his age was an attempt to “libel and demean” him.\n\nThe paper said its audience deserved “in-depth reporting and regular updates about the health of the leaders they elect.” The statement came in response to Trump’s Tuesday attack against the paper, apparently over a November article focused on his declining energy, which argued the Times should “cease publication because they are a horrible, biased, and untruthful ‘source’ of information.”\n\n“Mr. Trump welcomed our reporting on the age and fitness of his predecessors; we’re applying the same journalistic scrutiny to his vitality,” spokesperson Nicole Taylor wrote in a statement. “Our reporting is heavily sourced, based on interviews with people clsoe to the president and with medical experts. We won’t be deterred by false and inflammatory language that distorts the role of a free press.”\n\nStill, such an approach to news coverage didn’t seem to resonate with Trump, who claimed again that his cognitive test results were something few people, “including those working at The New York Times,” could do very well.\n\n“Despite all of this, the time and work involved, The New York Times, and some others, like to pretend that I am ‘slowing up,’ am maybe not as sharp as I once was, or am in poor physical health, knowing that it is not true, and knowing that I work very hard, probably harder than I have ever worked before,” Trump wrote. “I will know when I am ‘slowing up,’ but it’s not now! After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe it’s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean  ‘THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.’ They are true Enemies of the People, and we should do something about it.”\n\nThe Times’ Katie Rogers and Dylan Freedman reported last month that Trump has started his events later in recent months and his public appearances had decreased. They wrote that, while “Trump and the people around him still talk about him as if he is the Energizer Bunny of presidential politics,” “the reality is more complicated.”\n\nTrump lashed out at the paper hours after the story published, calling Rogers “ugly, both inside and out” for writing the story and claimed then that the paper was an “ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.”\n\nThe post New York Times Blasts Trump’s ‘False and Inflammatory’ Claim That Reporting on His Health Could Be Libelous appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 75-year-old Laurence Gerowitz, a real estate litigator, about his move into a larger condo in New York City. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI lived on the Upper East Side for most of my adult life: about 48 years, starting in the late 1970s. My wife and I bought into a co-op on 85th Street in 1999 for $265,000 and lived on the third floor of the five-story walk-up.\n\nOur apartment was 1,200 square feet and had a very nice layout, as well as a working fireplace. The building had no amenities whatsoever, but we were still very happy to be there. We lived there for 25 years and essentially raised our son in that apartment.\n\nIn 2008, he moved to Villanova, Pennsylvania — near Philadelphia — for college, and over the years it became clear he was never moving back to New York. He's now married and they live there with their two young children.\n\nNew York suits me just fine, but not so much for my son — between the impossible parking and our three-story walk-up, he wasn't interested.\n\nI understand why. When he used to visit, I'd have to go downstairs to help him haul everything up. We did have two bedrooms, which is a luxury in Manhattan, but there still wasn't a comfortable place for him and his family to sleep, and I'd end up on a blow-up mattress.\n\nIt was just untenable; they didn't enjoy visiting.\n\nAbout two years ago, my wife noticed that a new complex was being built around the corner from us called the Harper. She's a painter and interior decorator, so she wanted to take a look.\n\nWe toured a two-bedroom apartment, which we thought was very nice, but it was also small. Still, we thought the building's amenities were fantastic. They have a gym, music room, game room, playroom, and creative studio — which we thought would be great for our grandkids.\n\nWe sat with the idea for a while. A couple of months later, we went back to see a larger unit — a model of about 1,853 square feet with an 80-square-foot terrace and three bedrooms, one of which could be used as an office.\n\nAfter that tour, it didn't take us long to decide to move to the Harper. In the end, it took a couple of months to stage our old co-op, and then a few more months to sell.\n\nThe best things I've ever done in my life are being a good father and grandfather. My son texts or calls me at least once a day, and that's my proudest accomplishment — even more than being admitted to the bar at 48 after going to night school for four years while supporting a family.\n\nA big reason we decided to upsize and buy the condo was that my wife and I love being around my son and his family, and we really wanted to create a place where the kids would want to come visit.\n\nWe moved into the Harper in March 2024. It's just around the corner from our old place. It wasn't a far move, but we've spent decades living on the Upper East Side for a reason — we love the neighborhood.\n\nOur new condo has a really well-thought-out layout. We have three bedrooms, including a home office, and two-and-a-half bathrooms. When you walk in, you can turn left into one wing, down that hall are the primary closet, the primary bedroom and bathroom, and the terrace.\n\nIf you go to the right instead, a quick left takes you into the kitchen and great room. Further to the right are the guest bedroom and bathroom, a third bedroom that I use as my office, and a small laundry area.\n\nBesides having a larger apartment and living in a building that actually has an elevator, we're especially happy about the amenities. It's such a contrast to our old place, where the only extra space was the boiler room.\n\nOur grandkids especially love the building's music room. They can bang on the drums, sing into the microphone, and strum a guitar. There's also a playroom with a ball pit.\n\nIn the beginning, whenever the grandkids would come over, they would go down to the ball pit three times a day. In the mornings, I'd have to plead with them to finish their breakfast before heading down to play.\n\nIt's obvious they love visiting our new home. The grandkids talk about it all the time, and it's cute to see them arrive, dragging their little suitcases, already excited to play.\n\nI have very fond memories of our old place — it was the first home I ever bought. But over time, living there became stressful.\n\nI was on the board, constantly worrying about the building — especially whether the boiler would work. It was an older property with no central air, just radiators, so there were always issues with the heat.\n\nHere at the Harper, it's a completely different experience. Everything works, we have three separate HVAC zones that you can set to the exact degree, and the staff is great. My biggest dilemma now is whether to go to my gym on 91st Street or just head downstairs.\n\nI think upsizing later in life is a good thing if you're in a position where it makes sense for you.\n\nIf it's within your means to make that choice, do it. You're not just gaining more physical space; you're also giving yourself and your family more options.\n\nWhen my son and his family visit, they have their own rooms and are well taken care of. I think they genuinely enjoy coming now; it no longer feels like an obligation.",

    "fullText": "Mets slammed as “doomed” by former MLB execs after Alonso news originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt took less than a day for the mood of New York Mets’ observers to hit rock bottom. After losing All-Star closer Edwin Diaz to the Los Angeles Dodgers, former MLB general managers Jim Duquette, Jim Bowden and Steve Phillips spent the morning on MLB Network Radio suggesting the New York Mets should be “panicked.” Hours later, it was reported that Pete Alonso agreed to a five-year, $155 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles, and the same group reportedly shifted their tone to “doomed.”\n\nSNY broadcaster and former Met Ron Darling on MLB Network’s MLB Tonight said he was “flabbergasted.”\n\nAlonso’s departure is not only a big blow to the Mets’ offseason plans, but it ends a franchise era.\n\nAlonso, who turned 31 Sunday,  hit .272 with 38 home runs, 126 RBI and an .871 OPS over 162 games last season. He finishes his Mets tenure with 264 career home runs, the most in franchise history, along with 712 RBI and a .253 career batting average.\n\nThat’s elite middle-of-the-order production vanishing overnight.\n\nNew York also missed on a potential left-handed power fit when Kyle Schwarber re-signed with Philadelphia.  Brandon Nimmo’s departure via trade to the Texas Rangers for Marcus Semien creates even more questions for the Mets.\n\nEven at closer, the Mets are asked to trust Devin Williams, a new arrival and high-pressure answer after Diaz left for Los Angeles on a three-year, $69 million deal. Mets GM David Stearns said they think that Williams’ career-worst year against the Mets in 2025 was because he was “unlucky.”\n\nWith the biggest names gone, Stearns must get creative. Options remain, but none come without risk — and none replace Alonso’s presence by themselves.\n\nHere are the most realistic paths still on the board:\n\nCody Bellinger\nA lefty bat with defensive flexibility in the outfield and at first base. Once an MVP-caliber slugger, he hit .272 with 29 homers last season.\n\nOne of the few impact bats left on the market after 2025: last season he hit .266 with 22 home runs, 73 RBI, 91 runs scored, and compiled an .841 OPS in 136 games.\n\nAlex Bregman\nA high-floor infielder who could stabilize the batting order, but doesn’t replace pure first-base power. He’s one of the bigger bats still available.\n\nBo Bichette\nMore contact hitter than slugger, but an impact offensive piece who could reshape the overall lineup profile.\n\nThose names provide lineup value, but the Mets lost production and popular players.\n\nAlsono was not only a durable first baseman who has led the MLB in home runs since his debut. Diaz was a closer who electrified Citi Field with his entrances and dominated in high leverage.  Fans identified with them, and their teammates reportedly embraced them.\n\nThe former GMs on MLB Network Radio have seen enough offseasons to know when desperation is creeping in. Two franchise pillars are gone. The division remains brutal. And the fan base just watched its most iconic slugger pack for Baltimore.\n\nDarling was blunt in his assessment, too.\n\n\"This is a real loss for the New York Mets,\" Darling said.\n\nIf the Mets don’t respond aggressively and fast, this winter may be remembered not as a turning point but as a full-scale collapse.",

The news comes a day after the Mets’ long-term closer, Edwin Díaz, reached a three-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe 31-year-old slugger had been unable to find a long-term deal last season and returned to the Mets on a shorter contract, which he opted out of after this year’s World Series. While the Mets were interested in re-signing him they reportedly never made an offer once other teams were willing to offer longer, more valuable deals to the the first baseman.\n\nAlonso has spent his entire MLB career with the Mets, and last season broke Darryl Strawberry’s franchise record for home runs. He ends his Mets career with 264 home runs. He was also incredibly popular with the team’s fans due to his good-nature and power, earning the nickname Polar Bear. The Mets also lost another long-term popular player, Brandon Nimmo, last month in a trade with the Texas Rangers.\n\nAlonso had one of the best offensive seasons of his career in 2025 – he hit .272 with 38 home runs and 126 RBIs – but there are concerns about his defense, a weak point for the Mets, and base running, and the Mets appeared reluctant to give him a multi-year deal when they have already have Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor on expensive, long-term contracts.",

    "fullText": "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — Brady Cook will take the snaps with the New York Jets' starters at practice Wednesday, opening the possibility the undrafted rookie quarterback could start Sunday at Jacksonville.\n\nCoach Aaron Glenn said neither Tyrod Taylor nor Justin Fields will participate on the field while dealing with injuries, and the team will see how both quarterbacks feel as the week progresses.\n\n“There's a plan for the quarterbacks,” Glenn said. “Either way it works out during the week, we've got all our bases covered.”\n\nTaylor made his third straight start for the benched Fields last Sunday before injuring his groin late in the first quarter of the Jets' 34-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins. Cook, who was Taylor's backup because Fields was ruled out ahead of the game with knee soreness, filled in and went 14 of 30 for 163 yards and two interceptions in his NFL regular-season debut.\n\n“I thought he did a pretty good job,” Glenn said of Cook’s performance. “It was a tough situation for him with Tyrod going down and him not getting all the reps with the first team.”\n\nNew York also signed Adrian Martinez to the practice squad after he was released Tuesday by San Francisco. Martinez, the 2024 UFL MVP and UFL championship game MVP, was with the Jets through training camp this past summer.\n\nCook, who was sacked six times and came up limping slightly at one point in the game against the Dolphins, will be listed on the injury report but Glenn said he'll be fine. The coach was looking forward to Cook getting snaps with the starters Wednesday.\n\n“Man, that does a lot for every quarterback, especially if we're getting him to building continuity with the rest of the guys,” Glenn said.\n\nCook, who threw for 9,008 yards and 49 touchdowns with 15 interceptions in five seasons at Missouri, was signed to the active roster Saturday. He had been promoted from the practice squad for two previous games this season, but hadn’t played in the regular season.\n\nCook was 25 of 38 for 235 yards and a touchdown with one interception in three preseason games.\n\nThe Jets (3-10), who were eliminated from playoff contention for the 15th straight season, are dealing with several other injuries.\n\nGlenn said running back Breece Hall, tight ends Mason Taylor and Stone Smartt, defensive lineman Harrison Phillips, linebackers Quincy Williams and Kiko Mauigoa, and cornerback Azareye'h Thomas won't practice as they deal with various ailments. Glenn added that some of the players are simply being rested.\n\nStar wide receiver Garrett Wilson is eligible to come off injured reserve after sitting four games with a knee injury, but Glenn said he hasn't yet been cleared to practice.\n\nThe Jets signed defensive lineman Eric Watts to the active roster and placed rookie D-lineman Tyler Baron on injured reserve after he hurt a knee against Miami.\n\nTight end Nick Muse, a seventh-round draft pick out of Minnesota in 2022, was signed to the practice squad. He was most recently with the Los Angeles Rams, who released him Tuesday, and also had stints with Philadelphia and Arizona.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "title": "Look inside the Armour-Stiner Octagon House, an ornate 19th-century mansion in New York, decorated for the holidays",
    "description": "The Armour-Stiner Octagon House in Irvington, New York, is a whimsical example of a 19th-century, eight-sided mansion.",
    "fullText": "In the mid-19th century, the concept of octagon houses was all the rage among fashionable Americans.\n\nIts popularity was attributed to a best-selling 1848 book by Orson Squire Fowler, a phrenologist, sexologist, and amateur architect, called \"The Octagon House: A Home For All.\"\n\nFowler championed eight-sided houses because they received twice as much light as a traditional four-sided property and allowed owners to view the grounds from all angles.\n\nThe Armour-Stiner Octagon House in the New York City suburb of Irvington-on-Hudson, around 18 miles from the northern tip of Manhattan, is a prime example of the genre.\n\nUnusually for an octagon house, it features a giant dome, added by its second owner, Joseph H. Stiner, a wealthy tea and coffee merchant who bought the property in 1872.\n\nThe result is a fairytale residence that its current owner, Joseph Pell Lombardi, lovingly restored, beginning in 1978. The preservation architect purchased it from the National Trust for Historic Preservation for $75,000 (equivalent to $387,300 today), with certain conditions, including stabilizing the structure and dome.\n\nIn his book, \"The Armour-Stiner (Octagon) House,\" Lombardi said his goal was \"to hold together the fragile exotic beauty of this lyrical home.\"\n\nThe 8,000-square-foot property, which was restored to its original 1870s glory, is open to the public through private tours that must be reserved in advance.\n\nTake a look inside the residence while it is decked out for a Victorian-style Christmas.\n\nThe octagonal mansion began life as a flat-roofed, two-story building with a raised basement commissioned by New York City banker Paul J. Armour.\n\nArmour died in 1866, just six years after buying the house. His widow, Rebecca, went on to sell it to Stiner for $27,000 in 1872.\n\nThe Hungarian-born businessman, who made his fortune from importing products such as tea, coffee, and cocoa, rebuilt his summer and weekend retreat in the form of an ancient classical temple with more than 20 rooms.\n\nStiner, a father of six, whose family lived in the house for only 10 years, built the 56-column veranda that surrounds the first story, resembling a fairground carousel.\n\nGuests are greeted by cast-stone lions flanking the sweeping stairs that lead to the structure, which features elaborate gas lamps and a cast-iron railing.\n\nIt allows visitors to view the grounds from every perspective, offering sun and shade depending on where they choose to sit and the time of day.\n\nTour guide Kate Mincer, who greeted our group of four at the door, explained how Stiner turned the house into a \"temple of whimsy\" by bringing in interesting motifs and designs from around the world.\n\nThe walls of the entry hall are adorned with silver leaf and stenciled decorations in trompe l'oeil neo-Baroque frames.\n\nMincer also highlighted the miniature antique Christmas tree, made from goose feathers dyed green, with traditional, hand-blown glass ornaments from Germany.\n\nStiner's wife, Hannah, impressed visitors with her immaculate salon, which featured a bay window that flooded the room with light.\n\n\"Hannah's era was the lead-up to the really showy time period of the Gilded Age,\" Mincer said. \"But this room has the kind of detail you would see in opera houses in Europe, not necessarily in private summer cottages.\"\n\nThe space features a parlor suite by the renowned 19th-century furniture maker John Jelliff, which includes two sofas, an armchair, and an armless chair designed to accommodate ladies' skirts.\n\nFor the holiday season, the Christmas tree in the salon is covered in colorful ornaments, including layered decorations crafted from embossed cardboard, foil, and paper, accented with antique trimmings.\n\nMany were handmade by Jessica Lombardi, the museum director, and a team of docents who copied the Dresden style of ornament making, which originated in Germany in the late 19th century.\n\nThe Stiners, who eventually moved into the house year-round, supported landscape painters from the 19th-century Hudson River School of Art.\n\nMost of the images are local to Irvington-on-Hudson, with views of the Palisades along the Hudson River and a particularly wide section of the river known as the Tappan Zee.\n\nAn oil canvas by Robert Havell Jr. is a 1866 depiction of the nearby Old Dutch Church, made famous by author Washington Irving's \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\"\n\nThe dining room is the only room in the Octagon House with a rounded space, inspired by the theme of a Roman temple.\n\nIt contains a Renaissance Revival walnut dining table with semi-circular ends, adding an unusual touch.\n\nMuseum staff have meticulously set the table for Christmas Day, 1872, the year Stiner bought the property. The dining table features a menu that lists dishes such as roast goose or croquettes wrapped in bacon, finishing with plum pudding.\n\nThe silverware is Reed & Barton Roman Medallion 1870s flatware, featuring a Roman centurion's head at its base.\n\nCurrent owner Joseph Pell Lombardi discovered one of the pieces at the bottom of a dumbwaiter in 1978. It led to a two-decade search to acquire the complete set.\n\nThe triangular-shaped pantry includes original cabinets, a dumb waiter, and a soft copper sink, designed to minimize the risk of damage to crockery during the washing up.\n\nThe first-floor kitchen, with its writing desk for planning menus and a cast-iron stove, was designed for the lady of the house, despite the servants she employed.\n\nMincer explained how, within the era, the writers Harriet Beecher Stowe and her sister, Catharine Beecher, suggested that gentlewomen should take an active role in household proceedings.\n\n\"Most of the cooking was done elsewhere, but this was Mrs. Stiner's hub,\" the guide said.\n\nThe kitchen contains a selection of Joseph Stiner & Co. Importers' tea and coffee tins, including one that lists the merchant's chain of shops in Manhattan.\n\n\"At the height of his success, Mr. Stiner was basically Starbucks before Starbucks,\" Mincer joked.\n\nThe second story of the house was reserved for the Stiner family, who would relax and sleep there. It felt more cozy than downstairs.\n\nThe color palettes are softer, but the gasolier in this particular room, the former primary bedroom, is no less ornate.\n\nOne bedroom visible on the tour has a set of so-called \"cottage furniture,\" made by Hart, Ware & Co. Their designs became a fad in the mid-19th century.\n\nA more affordable type of wood, such as pine, was painted to resemble the look of ebony. The Armour-Stiner Octagon House pieces — including the bed, dresser, and side tables — come with gold filigree and river scenes.\n\nAnother interesting detail is the stretch of fabric that conceals the otherwise unattractive mechanism connecting the gasolier to the ceiling.\n\nLombardi turned one of the children's bedrooms into a curio room — basically a home museum — to reflect the Victorian obsession with natural specimens, such as mounted butterflies.\n\nIt also houses a 19th-century, patented Wooton desk with numerous drawers and nooks and crannies for ordering and storing items of interest.\n\nThe old-fashioned greeting cards are in the style of the illustrator Louis Prang, who popularized their distribution by mail. He became known as \"the father of the American Christmas card.\"\n\nMany depict flowers such as peonies and roses, while the later versions show wintry scenes trimmed with lace.\n\n\"We have images of St. Nicholas wearing purple, green, and brown instead of the iconic red suit,\" Mincer told our group, adding that Santa Claus had yet to solidify into the familiar character we now know.\n\nThe solo children's bedroom on the tour is situated on the third floor of the house. It has a homely feel with a spruce floor and porcelain doorknobs.\n\nOld-fashioned toys in the room include a teddy bear and dolls dressed in Victorian attire.\n\nLong shelves in the child's bedroom house Lionel train sets dating from 1910, depicting 1870s luxury Pullman passenger cars.\n\nThey were collected for display, along with the period lithograph prints of the actual trains, which ran on the Hudson River Railroad and were the height of luxury during the Stiners' time.\n\nMincer said the mistress of the house practiced dancing and watercolors in the high-ceilinged room with large, north-facing windows.\n\nIt contains a complete Egyptian Revival furniture set created by the prestigious New York manufacturers Pottier & Stymer, who were highly sought after in the 1870s.\n\nThe Lombardi family visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art to photograph the company's rare examples of Egyptian Revival art on display. They spent months recreating the designs to fit the suite. Its upholstery was woven in the Aubusson style.\n\nThe Egyptian Revival spinet piano brought music to the room. It is adorned with Egyptian hieroglyphics. \"The designs weren't accurate, but resembled how people from that era thought they looked,\" Mincer said.\n\nThe table opposite the piano displays a silver menorah on top, reflecting the Stiner's Jewish faith ahead of Hanukkah.\n\nThe fourth and fifth floors of the house are off-limits to visitors, partly because the steep stairs don't meet current building codes.\n\nOn a previous visit, before the code was introduced, I toured the unpartitioned dance room, which features eight windows and a spiral staircase up to the observatory. It commands beautiful views of the Hudson River.\n\nThe holiday tours take place during the day, but it's possible to see the house festively lit up at night from the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail, which borders the property.\n\nI made a quick return visit to see the exterior lights on the night of my tour and was reminded of the splendor inside.\n\nLombardi certainly stayed true to that ambitious pledge of holding \"together the fragile exotic beauty of this lyrical home.\"",

    "description": "The Kansas City Chiefs will have needs at both running back and wide receiver to address during the offseason. As a result, an ESPN insider named Kansas City as a possible landing spots for Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets and Jacksonville Jaguars free agents.",
    "fullText": "ESPN insider names Chiefs as landing spot for Colts, Jets, Jaguars pending free agents originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTwo positions the Kansas City Chiefs will have to take a long, hard look at this coming offseason are running back and wide receiver.\n\nAt running back, both Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco are pending free agents, and neither one has been that good this season, so the Chiefs could use an upgrade.\n\nAt wide receiver, Kansas City desperately needs to add a deep threat to bring some explosiveness to an offense that has lacked it since Tyreek Hill was traded.\n\nIn their weekly NFL buzz article, ESPN's Dan Graziano and Jeremy Fowler agree that the Chiefs need to make a move at both positions.\n\nAs a result, Fowler suggests the Chiefs as possible landing spots for New York Jets running back Breece Hall, Jacksonville Jaguars rusher Travis Etienne, and Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Alec Pierce.\n\nThe Chiefs and Ravens are both teams that need a classic boundary receiver on the outside and could address that with one big move in free agency. George Pickens would be a significant upgrade in Baltimore, and Alec Pierce would satisfy that need in Kansas City, which has been starved for explosive playmaking on the outside since Tyreek Hill was traded after the 2021 season.\n\nBoth would be costly, and Pickens might be franchise tagged by Dallas. But if available, the Ravens could use some of their $40 million in 2026 cap space on Pickens, knowing John Harbaugh is good at managing big personalities. The Chiefs are much lower on space, sitting at minus-$42.8 million, but cuts are on the way for a team that might look drastically different this time next year. Also, adding an explosive running back such as Breece Hall or Travis Etienne Jr. is worth exploring for Kansas City.\n\nOf course, all three of those players are pending free agents, but we wouldn't expect all three to actually hit the open market.\n\nHall is the one we could see getting the franchise tag, which would enable the Jets to get something for him via trade instead of letting him walk for nothing.\n\nWe wouldn't rule out the Jets extending him, either, although Hall might not be amenable to that and could want a change of scenery from the lowly Jets.\n\nAdding Hall would be a great move for Kansas City, as the veteran rusher can add a much-needed explosive element to the Chiefs' offense, both as a runner and pass-catcher, thanks to his home-run ability.\n\nAs fun as it would be to see Hall, who drew interest from the Chiefs at the trade deadline last month, playing in Andy Reid's offense, we would consider that happening highly unlikely.\n\nNot only would the Chiefs have to give up draft capital to acquire Hall, assuming he gets the franchise tag, they would also have to pay him a lucrative, long-term deal that Spotrac projects will cost around $10.4 million annually.\n\nWe just don't see the Chiefs jumping through all those hoops. Now, if Hall hits free agency and Kansas City can sign him outright, that changes things.\n\nEtienne is the more realistic target, as he will hit the open market, barring the Jags extending him beforehand, which remains a possibility after what has been a bounce-back year for him.\n\nBut the Jaguars also invested a fourth-round pick in Bhayshul Tuten and the team is only projected to have $9.4 million in cap space, so they might opt to take the cheaper route at running back.\n\nSpotrac projects a much more reasonable contract for Etienne at $6.6 million per year over two years. That is much \n\nEtienne isn't as explosive as Hall, but he'd still provide a sizeable upgrade over Hunt and Pacheco, both as a rusher and pass-catcher.\n\nAs for Pierce, he'd be exactly what the doctor ordered for the Chiefs' passing attack, as he's one of the best big-play weapons in the NFL, as evidenced by his league-leading 20.2 yards per reception this season.\n\nPierce, who is in the midst of a career-best season and is only 25, has never posted elite production, but that will also help keep his price down a bit.\n\nSpotrac projects Pierce will land a four-year, $63.9 million contract, which amounts to $16 million annually. That would be a fair price for a receiver who would check a huge box for KC while providing a perfect complement to Rashee Rice.\n\nThe Colts are going to be keen on keeping Pierce, though, and unlike the Chiefs, Indy is going to have plenty of funds to keep him around.\n\nRavens named possible landing spot for Cowboys' pending free agent\n\nBroncos have six ways to clinch a playoff berth in Week 15\n\nPatriots AFC East, playoff-clinching scenarios for Week 15\n\nFun age-related Philip Rivers facts as QB comes out of retirement\n\nCowboys' updated outlook in NFC East after Eagles' loss\n\nPhilip Rivers' first child is older than this many Colts players",

Columbus prospect didn’t have an exceptional senior year of high school, either, throwing for just about 1,100 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nHe redshirted in Berkeley in 2022 and was the backup for the first half of the 2023 season until getting his first opportunity in Week 6 against Oregon State and never looking back.\n\nAfter throwing for 3,000 yards and 16 touchdowns in 2024, Mendoza hit the transfer portal and has starred at Indiana this season leading the Hoosiers to an undefeated regular season and then beating Ohio State in the Big 10 championship.\n\nIf Justyn Martin from Inglewood, Calif., did not de-commit from the Golden Bears in late September, one wonders if Mendoza would have ever been offered by Cal at all – and whether Yale would have had a Heisman frontrunner on its hands.\n\nRated as the second-best quarterback behind only Florida’s DJ Lagway as a five-star prospect, Sayin committed to Alabama over Georgia and LSU as Michigan, Notre Dame and others were involved earlier but the Carlsbad, Calif., standout shied away from playing in the cold weather.\n\nPlaying for coach Nick Saban – and offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien – were huge draws for Sayin to pick the Crimson Tide but a few short weeks after arriving in Tuscaloosa, Saban retired and O’Brien left for Boston College.\n\nThen-Washington coach Kalen DeBoer got the Alabama job and according to the book The Price: What it Takes to Win in College Football’s Era of Chaos, the new Crimson Tide coach made Sayin wait to meet him and then acted like he didn’t know who he was during the short meeting.\n\nThe former five-star transferred to Ohio State, sat behind Will Howard last season as the Buckeyes won the national championship and then Sayin won the starting job leading Ohio State to the No. 2 overall ranking in the College Football Playoff.\n\nSo far this season, Sayin has thrown for 3,323 yards with 31 touchdowns and six interceptions.\n\nA three-star junior college prospect at New Mexico Military Institute, Pavia then transferred to New Mexico State where in 2023 he led the Aggies to a shocking 31-10 win at Auburn and emerged as one of the hottest quarterbacks in the transfer portal after that season.\n\nAfter two seasons at New Mexico State, Pavia has now spent two seasons at Vanderbilt and the Commodores at 10-2 have their first double-digit winning season in program history dating back to 1902.\n\nPavia in many ways has taken the college football world by storm over the last two years and he also had at least a part – either by publicly talking about him or showing what Vanderbilt football is capable of – of landing five-star quarterback Jared Curtis, who flipped from Georgia around National Signing Day.\n\nHe’s thrown for 2,924 yards with 26 touchdowns and six picks this season and also leads the Commodores with 661 rushing yards and eight TDs.\n\nRanked as the fifth-best running back in the 2023 class, Love chose Notre Dame over Alabama, Michigan, Texas A&M, Oregon and others midway through his senior season.\n\nAt the time of his pledge, the Irish also had running back pledges from Dylan Edwards, who has had a wild recruitment and college career of changing schools, along with Jayden Limar.\n\nThe Christian Brothers standout was the second St. Louis standout who was in that Notre Dame class along with four-star DB Christian Gray who played at De Smet.\n\nLove has rushed for more than 1,000 yards in each of the last two seasons and would be the first running back to win the Heisman Trophy since Derrick Henry in 2015. The former four-star has rushed for 1,372 yards and 18 touchdowns this season and those will be his final stats since the Irish turned down a bowl game bid.",

    "title": "A Rivian spin-off is betting $305 million on e-bikes. I rode it around New York City, and it felt natural — and powerful.",
    "description": "I use my steel Fuji road bike for everything. So when I heard about a new e-bike from Rivian spin-off Also, I couldn't resist trying it out.",
    "fullText": "Many Americans view cars as a necessity. But for me, and millions of other people, bikes are how we get where we need to go.\n\nMy steel Fuji road bike is like another limb. I use it to get to work, grab groceries, and pedal to see my friends. I can haul it onto the subway if I get tired, or if the weather takes a surprise turn for the worse. It's cheap to maintain, and I can use it in place of a gym membership.\n\nIn New York City, where I live, e-bikes — the road bike's zoomier cousin — are everywhere. They're not just popular with the 135,000 members of Citibike, our city's bike-share program; businesses have also embraced them. Many delivery workers use e-bikes to avoid our city's awful traffic snarls, and giants like Amazon use them to drop off packages and reduce emissions.\n\nSo when one of my colleagues told me they'd been getting emails from Also, a new e-bike company, I couldn't resist hopping in the saddle. I've been thinking about buying an e-bike, and the emails said Also's bike, the TM-B, had some unique features. The fact that it had been spun out of Rivian, a $21 billion electric vehicle company, intrigued me.\n\nRivian has retained a minority stake in Also — as in, \"you can drive a car, and you can also ride a bike.\" Also uses the same battery cells as Rivian's autos, and takes inspiration from the carmaker's drive for simplicity. While many e-bikes are manufactured by traditional bike makers, Also sticks exclusively with electric-powered products. It has raised $305 million, according to Pitchbook.\n\nJust before Thanksgiving, I met up with Saul Leiken, Also's director of product, to learn about the new $4,500 TM-B and take it for a spin around Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood.\n\nI came away surprised at how flexible it was, and thinking it could be a good add-on — or primary method of transportation — for many households across the US.\n\nAll e-bikes are complex pieces of machinery compared to normal bikes. In pedal-assist modes — when the motor only kicks in when you turn the pedals — the bike needs some way to process and interpret how hard you're pedaling to decide how much to help you. Those sensors need to be able to \"talk\" to the motor.\n\nThe TM-B, which stands for \"Transcendant Mobility Bike,\" operates on an entirely different level from your typical e-bike. The pedals don't connect to a chain; they power a generator and provide input to a computer system that tells the motor how much juice to give the bike, a system the company calls \"DreamRide.\" If there are updates, they'll be delivered over-the-air, like with your smartphone — or, increasingly, your car.\n\n\"Everything's software-defined,\" said Leiken, who also joined me on a test ride.\n\nIt struck me how digitized everyday transportation is becoming. Even gas-burning cars don't have direct, mechanical links between the steering wheel and the wheels or even the gas pedal and the engine. It's all digital, or \"drive by wire.\" That makes the TM-B \"pedal by wire.\"\n\nI started out riding the TM-B in \"All Purpose\" mode. I relied on pedal assist, and I changed the levels by tapping a small screen at the top of the bike's head tube. It didn't feel like I was giving instructions to a computer; it felt like I was pedaling.\n\nThe part of Manhattan we were riding in was pretty flat, and it was a somewhat chilly day. Even if I'd been using a normal bike, I probably would not have broken a sweat. But the assist from the DreamRide would be welcome on a warmer day, and I could see it propelling me over the Manhattan Bridge if I wanted to get to Brooklyn without much effort.\n\nLater on, we tried the TM-B's \"Sport\" mode, which approximates the experience of a standard, geared bicycle. There's no chain to clank around to let you know you've switched gears, but there is haptic feedback, just like on your smartphone, that courses through the pedals.\n\nState and local e-bike regulations are evolving, but in most states, there are three classes of e-bike, and the TM-B is what's called a \"Class 3\" e-bike, capable of hitting speeds up to 28 miles per hour. That's about as fast as a car will ever go in most places in New York City, except for a highway or a boulevard in one of the outer boroughs — in the middle of the night.\n\nI inched toward that top speed at a couple of points during our 30-minute ride. Once, early on, I cranked the pedal-assist level to its max. I was only going in the mid-20s, but still beating traffic because bikes are simply more nimble than cars, until we hit a red light.\n\nLater, when we were going west along a large block, I remembered to hit the throttle — a little orange button near my right thumb designed to take me up to 20 miles per hour.\n\nIt gave me a real rush; it felt almost like riding a motorbike, which I hadn't done in years. At the same time, I knew I had to be attentive, for my own safety and that of others.\n\nNationwide, estimated e-bike sales are between 1 million and 2 million a year. It's hard to be precise, partly because the market has so many players, and partly because customs data is incomplete and lumps e-bikes into a larger category of imports, according to eCycle Electric, a consulting firm. What's clear is that it's growing: eCycle predicts that sales will grow 14% to 25% per year until 2030.\n\nSome e-bike companies have run into trouble. Recently, Techcrunch reported that Rad Power Bikes, which says it has 680,000 customers, could run out of money by January 2026. VanMoof, a Dutch e-bike brand whose sleek rides stood apart from competitors with chunky batteries and conspicuous wiring, went bankrupt in 2023, and its new owners are trying to reestablish themselves.\n\nWhen I asked Leiken about this, he said Also's timing was better — some e-bike companies built too much during the pandemic and were desperate to unload inventory afterward — and its business model is less reliant on partners. The bike's adaptability struck me as a potential selling point, too: It can ride on roads, rutted streets, and trails, and can be used for a workout or a quick errand.\n\nSome things about the bike weren't final. The bell is digital, emitted by a speaker, and Leiken told me they were considering tweaking the tone and modifying it so that, if you hit it hard, it would sound like a car horn. It reminded me of how electric car manufacturers have created custom sounds to alert pedestrians at low speeds, as required by federal regulations.\n\nAlso has also rolled out a helmet, called the Alpha Wave. It has built-in front and rear lights meant to catch drivers' attention, speakers, and a noise-cancelling mic. While simple bike helmets provide some degree of protection in case of a collision, Also's helmet has a new technology called the Release Layer System that's meant to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury.\n\nThere's a learning curve to bike ownership, and Also seems focused on flattening that curve.\n\nWhile I didn't have the controls down pat in a roughly 30-minute ride, I felt completely safe the whole time, and I'm sure I would've gotten the hang of it in another hour. For a novice rider, it might take longer, and it would be smart to start in a park or a parking lot before mixing with traffic.\n\nOne of the more intriguing aspects of the bike was its swappable \"top frames.\" With a couple of taps, you can replace the seat with one for a much larger or much smaller rider. You can also swap in a roomier bench seat, or a seat with a utility rack to schlep cargo or a kid. It slots in like a ski boot, with a mechanical lock and an electrical connection to power the back lights on the bike. I'm not aware of any e-bikes with a similar feature.\n\nThe point of the TM-B wasn't just to create a fun ride, Leiken said. It was to further the idea of \"bikes as transportation\" — as something that can actually replace a car for local trips. While $3,500 is nothing to sneeze at, Leiken said the company wanted to bring a \"super-premium feature set and experience\" to riders. He said bikes with similar features are usually more like $8,000. Besides, a used car will set you back $25,000 on average, and an average new car is $50,000.\n\nI've long thought that e-bikes are generally good to have in society, and that they could replace a great deal of car trips. I've occasionally mulled buying one, but I feel like, as a fit person in my 30s, it might be overkill.\n\nThe TM-B didn't radically change my mind. I'm still undecided on buying an e-bike — I really love my Fuji road bike — but it could be good for someone who wants an e-bike that can do it all. It's a flexible workhorse, and given how pricey cars are getting, I think a lot of people could justify the price tag.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Moments after Luigi Mangione was handcuffed at a Pennsylvania McDonald’s, a police officer searching his backpack found a loaded gun magazine wrapped in a pair of underwear.\n\nThe discovery, recounted in court Monday as Mangione fights to keep evidence out of his New York murder case, convinced police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, that he was the man wanted in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan five days earlier.\n\n“It's him, dude. It's him, 100%,” an officer was heard saying on body-worn camera video from Mangione’s Dec. 9, 2024 arrest, punctuating the remark with expletives as the officer combing the bag, Christy Wasser, held up the magazine.\n\nWasser, a 19-year Altoona police veteran, testified on the fourth day of a pretrial hearing as Mangione sought to bar prosecutors from using the magazine and other evidence against him, including a 9 mm handgun and a notebook found during a subsequent bag search.\n\nThe testimony shed light on the critical minutes after Mangione was spotted at the McDonald’s and the sometimes unusual steps police officers took in collecting evidence critical to tying him to the crime.\n\nWhy the defense says the evidence shouldn't be used at trial\n\nMangione’s lawyers argue the items should be excluded because police didn’t have a search warrant and lacked the grounds to justify a warrantless search. Prosecutors contend the search was legal and that police eventually obtained a warrant.\n\nWasser, testifying in full uniform, said Altoona police protocols require promptly searching a suspect’s property at the time of an arrest, in part for dangerous items.\n\nOn body-worn camera video played in court, Wasser was heard saying she wanted to check the bag for bombs before removing it from the McDonald’s. Despite that concern, she acknowledged in her testimony Monday that police never cleared the restaurant of customers or employees.\n\nMangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. He appeared in good health on Monday, pumping his fist for photographers and chatting with his lawyers as testimony resumed.\n\nThe hearing, which was postponed Friday because of Mangione’s apparent illness, applies only to the state case. His lawyers are making a similar push to exclude the evidence from his federal case, where prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.\n\nWhy prosecutors say jurors should be able to see the evidence\n\nProsecutors have said the handgun found in the backpack matches the firearm used in the killing and that writings in the notebook showed Mangione’s disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference.\n\nThompson, 50, was killed as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for his company’s investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.\n\nMangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west of Manhattan, after police there received a 911 call about a McDonald’s customer resembling the suspect.\n\nWasser testified that she went to the McDonald’s on her own to assist another officer, Joseph Detwiler. Before that, she said, she had seen some coverage of Thompson’s killing on Fox News, including the surveillance video of the shooting and images of the suspected shooter.\n\nWasser began searching Mangione’s bag as officers took him into custody on initial charges of forgery and false identification, after he acknowledged giving them a bogus driving license, police said. The same fake name was used by the alleged gunman used at a Manhattan hostel days before the shooting.\n\nWasser told another officer she wanted to check the bag for a bomb before leaving the McDonald’s because she didn’t want to repeat an incident in which another Altoona officer had inadvertently brought a bomb to the police station.\n\nWhat did police find in Mangione's bag?\n\n“Did you call the bomb squad?” Mangione lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo asked.\n\n“No. I didn’t find a bomb yet,” Wasser responded.\n\nAccording to body-worn camera video, the first few items Wasser found were innocuous: a hoagie, a loaf of bread and a smaller bag containing a passport, cellphone and computer chip.\n\nThen she pulled out a gray pair of underwear, unwrapping them to reveal the magazine.\n\nSatisfied there was no bomb, she suspended her search and placed some of the items back in the bag. Some evidence, including Mangione’s laptop computer, was transported to the police station in a brown paper McDonald’s takeout bag, body-worn camera video showed.\n\nWasser resumed her search after an 11-minute drive to the police station and almost immediately found the gun and silencer — the latter discovery prompting her to laugh and exclaim “nice,” according to body-worn camera footage. Wasser said the gun was in a side pocket that she hadn't searched at McDonald’s.\n\nLater, while cataloging everything in the bag in what's known as an inventory search, she found the notebook and other notes, including what appeared to to-do lists and possible getaway plans.\n\n“Isn't it awesome?” Wasser said at one point during the search, according to the body-worn camera video.\n\nAsked to explain, she told Friedman Agnifilo on Monday that she was proud of her police department’s work in helping to capture Thompson’s suspected killer.\n\nA Blair County, Pennsylvania, prosecutor testified that a judge later signed off on a search warrant for the bag, a few hours after the searches were completed. The warrant, she said, provided a legal mechanism for Altoona police to turn the evidence over to New York City detectives investigating Thompson’s killing.\n\nAs he has throughout the case, Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann described Thompson’s killing as an “execution” and referred to his notebook as a “manifesto” — terms that Mangione’s lawyers said were prejudicial and inappropriate.\n\nJudge Gregory Carro said the wording had “no bearing” on him, but warned Seidemann that he’s “certainly not going to do that at trial” when jurors are present.",

    "fullText": "The first two officers arriving at the McDonald's on December 9, 2024 — the fifth day of the nationwide manhunt — had not been expecting much.\n\nNo one believed Thompson's shooter would be in the restaurant — not the two cops, not their supervisor, not even the store manager who'd reluctantly called 911 at their customers' insistence. The call had been dispatched as \"Priority: Low.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\" one of the officers asked, approaching Mangione at the back of the restaurant. \"Uh, Mark,\" Mangione answered, according to sealed police bodycam footage shown in court. He told them he was homeless.\n\nHe then handed over this New Jersey license — listing his name as \"Mark Rosario.\"\n\nMangione was then asked to pull down his blue-and-white paper medical mask, which Altoona patrolman Joseph Detwiler said made Mangioni stand out.\n\n\"We don't wear masks,\" Detwiler told the jury. \"We have antibodies.\"\n\nWhen Mangione's mask was lowered, everything changed. \"I knew it was him immediately,\" testified Detwiler. \"I stayed calm.\"\n\nBodycam footage showed the officer whistling along as Jingle Bell Rock played on the McDonald's sound system — to keep Mangione calm as well, as they ran his license, he told the judge.\n\nDetwiler had closely followed the manhunt for Thompson's killer, the veteran patrolman told New York Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro from the witness stand.\n\nHe'd said he'd seen NYPD social media postings publicizing the as-yet-unnamed shooting suspect's face. Elsewhere online, he had seen surveillance footage of the shooting, which was played in court.\n\n\"I knew in New York that they hadn't found the firearm,\" Detwiler testified. Safety, he explained, was behind the decision to frisk Mangione and search his backpack before arresting him on the initial Pennsylvania charges of forgery and providing a false ID to law enforcement.\n\nOnce at the Altoona Police station, a more thorough search of Mangione's backpack, pockets, clothing, and other belongings was conducted. Officers found this folded scrap of lined paper, filled with writing and diagrams in pencil.\n\nPart doodled map, part to-do list, it is filled with dates and tasks, only some of which were accomplished. Under \"12/8,\" the words \"Best buy\" had been crossed off, as were mentions of a USB drive, \"digital cam,\" and \"light source.\"\n\n\"Hot meal\" and \"water bottles\" were also crossed off.\n\nOther items on the list — including \"AAA bats\" and \"survival kit,\" under the date 12/9, the day of his arrest — were not crossed out.\n\nAt the Altoona police station, cops recovered $7,800 in large bills and currency from Thailand, Japan, and India, totaling $1,620, from Mangioni's backpack. \n\n\"There's a weapon,\" Patrolwoman Christy Wasser is heard saying soon after, in footage showing her continuing to search Mangione's backpack.\n\nGiven the gun and the at-first-overlooked knife, the decision was made to strip-search Mangione.",
