    "title": "New York Yankees' Kyle Tucker Hopes Slammed With Awful News",
    "description": "The New York Yankees are apparently pursuing Kyle Tucker, but they just received some bad news in that department.",
    "fullText": "The New York Yankees have reportedly moved away from Cody Bellinger and have pivoted to other options in MLB free agency. One of those options? Kyle Tucker.\n\nTucker is the jewel of this year's free-agent class and was viewed as a potential fit for the Yankees heading into the winter, but it didn't appear that New York had much interest in the four-time All-Star.\n\nHowever, recent events may have changed things for the Bronx Bombers, as Bellinger seems to be asking for $36-37 million annually, a rather steep price for a merely good — not great — 30-year-old player with an injury history.\n\nAs a result, the Yankees have evidently decided to turn their attention to Tucker, who was said to be seeking a $400 million contract at the outset of he offseason, but may have reduced his demands as a result of a slow market.\n\nBut unfortunately, it does not appear that New York is one of the favorites to sign him.\n\nFormer MLB general manager Jim Duquette has revealed that the Toronto Blue Jays, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets are the three teams most connected to Tucker and have all met with the outfielder either in person or via video call.\n\nDuquette wondered if any one of those three ballclubs would \"increase\" their offers, indicating that each of those teams have already made overtures to Tucker.\n\nSo, where do the Yankees fit in all of this? Have they made Tucker an offer? Are they laying in the weeds? Are they really not that interested in the former Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs star?\n\nIt's also entirely possible that Alex Bregman's recent five-year, $175 million contract with the Cubs has rejuvenated Tucker's market and, therefore, his asking price, which may have caused the Yanks to bow out of the process.\n\nNew York has not made a single notable addition this winter. The Yankees are supposedly trying to make a trade for a starting pitcher, but things appear to be moving at a snail's pace on that front.\n\nAs far as signing big-name free agents? Outside of Bellinger, New York has not seemed serious about anyone. It was also linked to Bo Bichette, but it seems hard to imagine the Yanks meeting his asking price, especially considering how bad he is defensively.\n\nIf the Yankees really want Tucker, they better jump in now, because all three of the teams mentioned have deep pockets and are clearly not afraid to spend.",

    "fullText": "It was a fine frenzy in East Rutherford this past season, with the NFL slapping the New York Giants organization, coaches, and players with fines totalling nearly $500,000. That represents roughly 12.5% of the average yearly total across the league ($4 million).\n\nBut it all goes to a good cause:\n\nThe fines collected are donated to the Professional Athletes Foundation to support Legends in need and the NFL Foundation to further support the health, safety and wellness of athletes across all levels, including youth football and the communities that support the game.\n\nThe following data was accumulated through the NFL's operations department, compiled as part of their gameday accountability tracker. It does not include or account for any private appeals and their subsequent results.\n\nHere's a look at all fines levied against the Giants in 2025:\n\nOL James Hudson, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/kneeing): $12,172\n\nLB Brian Burns, unsportsmanlike conduct (taunting): $11,593\n\nGiants organization, violating concussion protocol: $200,000\n\nHC Brian Daboll, conduct detrimental to the league: $100,000\n\nRB Cam Skattebo, conduct detrimental to the league: $15,000\n\nS Tyler Nubin, unnecessary roughness (hip-drop tackle): $10,324\n\nRB Cam Skattebo, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/tripping/kneeing): $6,157\n\nRB Tyrone Tracy Jr., unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $5,731\n\nDT Rakeem Nunez-Roches, unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $23,186\n\nS Dane Belton, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/tripping/kneeing): $7,201\n\nLB Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles, unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $7,292\n\nTE Theo Johnson, unnecessary rough (late hit): $6,488\n\nCB Dru Phillips, unnecessary roughness (hit on defenseless player): $7,292\n\nCB Dru Phillips, unnecessary roughness (pulling player off a pile): $7,293\n\nDB Raheem Layne, unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $5,722\n\nS Tyler Nubin, unsportsmanlike conduct (illegal celebration and vulgar acts): $10,324\n\nCB Rico Payton, unnecessary roughness (late hit): $5,333\n\nCB Rico Payton, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/tripping/kneeing): $5,333\n\nCB Dru Phillips, unnecessary roughness (late hit): $7,293\n\nIndividual franchise/coach/player fines: 14\n\nPlayer fined most times: S Dane Belton (3)\n\nLargest fine: Giants organization ($200,000)\n\nPlayer with highest fine total: DT Rakeem Nunez-Roches ($23,186)\n\nPlayer with largest fine: DT Rakeem Nunez-Roches ($23,186)\n\nCumulative fine total: $453,734\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants racked up nearly $500,000 in fines from NFL in 2025",

    "description": "Miles Guo was convicted of fraud. Now his formerly luxurious lifestyle is being broken down and sold for parts in bankruptcy court.",
    "fullText": "Miles Guo's home these days is a federal jail in Brooklyn. His life was once dizzyingly more fabulous.\n\nThe fraud-convicted one-time billionaire sailed on a gleaming superyacht, wore custom-tailored Brioni suits, and strode through his Gilded Age mansion on a million-dollar cushion of Chinese and Persian carpets.\n\nSince 2022, the cash, homes, luxury cars, and private jets of Guo's suptuous former life have been picked over by prosecutors, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a federal bankruptcy trustee — all trying to claw back money for thousands of creditors and victims in one of the most sprawling fraud cases in recent history.\n\nGuo — aka Ho Wan Kwok and Guo Wengui — lived so lavishly that the liquidation process has taken three years and counting.\n\nHere's a look at some of the priciest assets that, piece by extravagant piece, are being sold off as part of Guo's ongoing 2022 federal bankruptcy case.\n\nFederal prosecutors say Guo starred in Mandarin-language music videos and livestreams that enticed victims from around the world into investing $1.3 billion in his various anti-China and cryptocurrency schemes.\n\nMany of the videos show him in his 15-room Manhattan penthouse, gazing triumphantly at the city from either of two terraces overlooking Central Park.\n\nThe 7,000-square-foot home occupies the entirety of the 18th floor of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue, and is now being sold off as part of the bankruptcy.\n\nBrokers at Compass are asking $12 million — far less than the $67.5 million Guo paid for it in 2015, shortly upon his arrival from China on the heels of a corruption investigation there.\n\nIt was here that Guo was arrested by federal agents in 2023.\n\nConvicted in Manhattan of federal racketeering conspiracy in 2024, Guo's sentencing and a final ruling on forfeiture have been delayed five times, in part due to the complexity of his finances.\n\nGuo's Greenwich, Connecticut, mansion was sold for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate in 2024 for $7.2 million.\n\nThe 21-room, seven-bedroom home, which Guo bought for $4.6 million in 2020, borders the Stanwich Club golf course. Real estate listings feature tennis courts, an in-ground pool, a six-car garage, a billiards room, a gym, and a movie theater. Well-trimmed ivy climbs the stone and wood-shingled exterior.\n\nFederal prosecutors say the home featured bulletproof glass and that Guo employed round-the-clock security in the three years he lived there.\n\nLocated 25 miles from New York City in Mahwah, New Jersey, the historic Crocker-McMillin mansion is the last and most elaborate of the three addresses Guo purchased and then lost control of in the ongoing bankruptcy litigation.\n\nThe home's ceiling murals, elaborately carved railings, and other Gilded Age vestiges can be seen in real estate listings; brokers at Compass are asking $19 million.\n\nAccording to court filings and other online records, Guo bought the 21-bedroom estate for $26 million in 2022.\n\nHe was in the midst of spending another $18 million renovating and furnishing the Jacobean-styled home — built in 1907 by railroad heir George Crocker and modeled after England's Bramshill House — when he was arrested.\n\nGuo's plans included outfitting separate wings for his wife, his son, and his daughter. Federal prosecutors say he'd already purchased $978,000 in carpets, a $62,000, eight-foot-diameter Samsung television, and something his indictment called a $53,000 \"Louis XV-style gilt bronze fireplace log cradle.\"\n\nThe filings don't say if Guo intended to keep the mansion's floor-to-ceiling pipe organ, which likely came in handy during the seven decades the home was a Catholic seminary.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Guo's Cirrus SF50 Vision Jet — a seven-seater he'd purchased in 2019 — was sold back to Cirrus as part of the bankruptcy, for $3.5 million. A second private jet, a Bombardier Global XRS, netted some $12 million.\n\nThe estate has yet to sell Guo's third and last personal aircraft, a four-seat Cirrus SR22 single-engine propeller plane.\n\nGuo's ground-transportation options were also lavish, including a dozen top-end motorcycles and luxury cars, also being litigated for sale in the bankruptcy.\n\nA Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Roadster was seized by the feds from the six-car garage at the Connecticut mansion. And his videos still show him tooling around in his $3.5 million red Ferrari.\n\nThe most expensive of the cars is a $4.4 million custom Bugatti Chiron Super Sport.\n\nGuo's motor yacht, the Lady May, was the first big-ticket item to go on the auction block — in all her shimmering aluminum, white marble, and Macassar ebony glory.\n\nHe spent 41 million euros in fraud proceeds (worth $48 million today) to buy the vessel in 2018. The bankruptcy trustee recovered half that sum — $23 million — three summers ago, selling it, according to bankruptcy filings, to New England auto dealership magnate Herb Chambers.\n\nThe boat boasts five staterooms that can sleep 10 guests, including an owner's cabin with a spacious dressing room and his-and-hers en-suite bathrooms.\n\nGuo's pal and business partner, Steve Bannon, was infamously arrested on board in August 2020.\n\nYacht lovers who missed the 2023 bankruptcy sale have another chance to own it. Now refurbished, renamed \"Excellence V,\" and docked in Fort Lauderdale, the Lady May is listed for sale by yacht brokers Edmiston & Company for $29 million.\n\nGuo's videos, still online, show him stalking the yacht's bleached teak decks as he smokes cigars, raps in Mandarin about his wealth, and aims martial arts kicks at the camera.\n\nIn June, a hodge-podge of furniture, light fixtures, wall hangings, tableware, and knickknacks — 156 items, all from the Manhattan penthouse — were put on the virtual auction block in Connecticut.\n\nThe sale included an ornate mahogany chest of drawers that had been cryptically referred to in Guo's criminal file as \"A Louis XV Style French Ormolu-Mounted Mahogany Commode by Joseph Emmanuel Zweiner.\" \"Veneer damage\" and \"right and left side cracking,\" the auction listing read.\n\nA collection of six small ceramic figurines was listed together as \"Misc. Oriental Items\" and included a \"Damaged & Broken Pig.\" Even a \"Lot of (2) small trash cans\" was up for bidding.\n\nThe bankruptcy file sheds no light on the fate of the racks of hand-tailored Italian suits Guo spoke of while sitting in the library of his penthouse during a 2018 interview with the New York Post.\n\n\"I have 60 custom-made Brioni suits and handmade Louis Vuitton shoes,\" he told the tabloid, which said he added, \"I don't care about things. I'm a Buddhist.\"",

    "title": "I visited Nespresso's NYC flagship, with free coffee and a speakeasy. It showed me how brands want to be our identity.",
    "description": "The nearly 14,000 square-foot store offers free coffee and a place to hang out, but I probably won't be back.",
    "fullText": "At 4:45 pm on Wednesdays, I'm used to hearing my editors discuss the evening's stories. This week, I eavesdropped on a conversation about the similarities between a coffee pod and an oxidized avocado.\n\nI was visiting Nespresso's new flagship location in Manhattan's tourist-heavy Flatiron district, a well-lit, open-air space that feels almost like an Apple store. The Nestlé-owned coffee company opened the nearly 14,000 square-foot store in December, billing its now-largest retail space as \"a destination for modern coffee culture\" in a press release.\n\nPart of the store's big draw is the free coffee, and the self-service station features shiny machines and a wide array of pods. An extremely friendly employee approached me asking if I have a Nespresso — I don't — before explaining how the \"bright, citrusy\" Tanzania coffee pod compares to Velluto, which is like \"the house wine of coffee.\" She gave me instructions for using the machine, displaying the patience and helpful rhyming tips befitting a kindergarten teacher as I somehow fumbled with the two buttons.\n\nAfter having my double shot of Tanzania, which actually was quite bright and citrusy, I wandered over to the smelling station, where you can sniff 12 different brews. As I determined my favorite scent, I kept thinking about something that chef and restaurateur Jeremy Fall, the man behind this summer's viral Hamptons smoothie, told me a few months ago: \"The way people look at drinks is that they sort of say a lot about their identity.\"\n\nThe store also tries to make Nespresso part of customers' identity, with its push toward personalization and finding your signature blend. After helping me make coffee, the employee made sure to tell me that if I buy a glass cup, I can get it engraved with any personal message for free.\n\n\"If it's free, it's for me!\" she told me. The store emphasizes its free offerings, including a barista class and complimentary coffee, yet I couldn't shake my awareness that the whole point is to make me buy stuff. The walls are lined with mugs, nanofoamers, barista recipe makers, flavored syrups, Nespresso machines, pod holders, and even bag charms à la Labubu.\n\nYet there is also the genuine possibility of simply hanging out. Two employees let me know that the store's secret, hidden coffee speakeasy opened at 5 pm, tucked behind a painting on the lower level.\n\nI stepped inside around 5:15 pm, and a line had formed by 5:20 pm. The mocktail bar offered three drinks, and I went with \"The Hidden Fizz\" after the bartender said it was the most refreshing. The $15 drink was the only item I paid for during my visit.\n\nDespite the trappings of a speakeasy, the space didn't feel private, especially since multiple employees told me to visit. In the dim lighting and over an unidentifiable jazz song, people took pictures or chatted quietly.\n\nThough I generally avoid fruit-coffee combos, I liked the drink more than expected. I forced my coworkers, Henry and Ana, to meet me at the store and try it, too. Henry agreed that it was OK if a little too sweet, and didn't realize it had any coffee; Ana was \"literally obsessed.\"\n\nThere's also a lounge downstairs, with self-service coffee, couches, a chessboard, and a record player. When I walked in, an employee, dressed in the store's characteristic beige, stood at a counter reading \"How to Taste Coffee.\" Other books dotted the space, many of them focused on nature despite our being underground in New York City: multiple editions of \"Great Escapes,\" a photography collection featuring outdoor athletes, and a selection of works by the chronically outside painter Monet.\n\nMuch like Starbucks, it seems that the Nespresso flagship wants to be a third space, an informal social place beyond home or work. And to an extent, it accomplishes the goal — two guys at the chess table sat discussing H-1B visas, while two women huddled on a couch without even holding coffee cups.\n\nI don't see myself coming back, mainly because I'd prefer to spend my time in a smaller, local New York City café, but partly because of the not-so-subtle push to make me identify with, and identify myself by, the brand. Yet for those who don't mind that and can fight the impulse to buy Nespresso products, the store can serve as a rare spot to get a free coffee and sit on a plush sofa.",

After the Rangers scored their first goal…\n\n…The Boston Bruins put belt to ass for 60 straight minutes. 10-2 Bruins Win!\n\nYour TOI Leader was Charlie McAvoy, who had 21:26 logged last night.\n\nThe Bruins got to see what the New York Rangers are without their vaunted goaltender Igor Sheshterkin, and as it turns out, the New York Rangers suck out loud. The Bruins were allowed gorgeous opportunities to score all night, and with Sheshterkin out, the Rangers defense was effectively bullied all night, forcing a goalie change and a historic night in Boston.\n\nKhusnutdinov and Pavel Zacha had hat tricks tonight; as I’m sure you’ve read this is the first time since 1964 since the Bruins have ever had two players record double hatties on home ice.\n\nIn the middle of all this it can be easy to lose the guys who didn’t get hat tricks, but this was a phenomenal night for Fraser Minten, who got two goals, and Charlie McAvoy, who got his 2nd of the year. Good for both of them!\n\nDavid Pastrnak had the first 6 point game in almost 50 years for the Boston Bruins, joining Ken Hodge and Bobby Orr as the only players in team history to do such a thing. Just another moment on the pile for the legend. What a special player.\n\nI’m sure this game will produce some all-timer whining from JT Miller.\n\nJeremy Swayman, now properly rested and to be clear, was not doing nothing all game, had a pretty good finish; .931 SV% on 29 shots is nothing to sneeze at. Now, let’s make absolutely sure Korpi starts today. Okay?\n\nThe last time the Bruins scored 10 in a game was back in 1988, when they absolutely pasted the Blackhawks in a 10-3 contest. That game featured Cam Neely with a 7 point night, Craig Janney with a 3 assist night, Steve Kasper with two goals, and 5 other Bruins scoring in that contest. Tidy bit of work by the B’s tonight. Tidy bit indeed.\n\nThe Bruins continue things on today against the Pens! That game is at 5pm EST.",

    "fullText": "Friday's usual \"Ask The Maven\" was on holiday but  \"ATM\" is running today. This week's question comes from City Island, New York. Jack Gumpert asks:\n\nHOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HOW THE TV MEDIA IS HANDLING THE RANGERS SITUATION?\n\nThe Maven replies: You have to start with the fact that whether the Blueshirts win or lose, it's all there for the public to see on the screen, in person as well as all the replays available.\n\nThere can be no cheating the viewing public.\n\nMSG Networks' analyst styles vary. Sam Rosen and Joe Micheletti, for example, were more –  shall I say – temperate in their handling of a non-playoff team. They were professional and rational which were fair enough and the fans adored them.\n\nThe very able replacements, Kenny Albert and Dave Maloney, have brought their pungent-no-kidding-around radio styles superbly to television and – I'm certain – fans find it most refreshing.\n\nEmotional – in a fan kind of way – Maloney reacts more forcefully than Micheletti while Albert\n\ncontinues to be the best play-by-play man for which a Rangers fan can root. MSG Networks employs a variety of other analyst types and some penetraiting ones.\n\nI was intrigued with a post-game schmooze the other night between the very insightful John Gianonne and Steve Valiquette. It was very revealing in terms of Vally's comments about some of the Rangers. Take a look:\n\n\"Now is the time of year where you start sitting people,\" Valiquette asserted. \"You have to get everybody's attention. You start with Lafreniere; he's pacing for 16 goals. Terrible giveaway (late vs. Buffalo) again; getting less than 15 minutes of ice time right now. You have to get more from him.\n\n\"You need to get more from your top six and I think that it sends a message to everybody that they can be next. One of the biggest challenges NHL teams have is that guys make a lot of money and you can't shame or blame a millionaire. But you can embarrass them by taking away their ice time. That's the only thing you can control.\n\nRemembering Glenn Hall Against The Rangers I have to admit that The Maven has taken the passing of Hall of Fame goalie Glenn Hall hard. Tearful hard.\n\n\"You can control the narrative in your room if you do that. You can go there. Sometimes during a game, you miss a shift. Panarin not backchecking on the empty net goal should cost  PP time in the next game.\n\n\"You have a meeting with him (and say) 'Look, you didn't skate at the end of the game on the PP.'\"\n\nToday, we'll see who comes through and who doesn't and I expect that the MSG Networks' pros will tell us what we need to know!\n\nOh, yeah, by the way, they need two points!",

    "fullText": "Following the publication of a report in The New York Times on Friday night revealing that the Washington National Opera will be leaving the Kennedy Center, members of the Trump administration immediately began scrambling to reframe the news as not only a positive, but their idea.\n\nKennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi, who has been hard at work lashing out at artists for canceling scheduled performances at the once-revered venue, posted a statement to X claiming that the center’s relationship with the opera group has “presented ongoing financial challenges for well over a decade” that “long predate the current leadership.”\n\n“Given the longstanding financial strain, it has become necessary for us to part ways to protect the best interests of the Center,” Daravi wrote.\n\nThe statement was then amplified by the venue’s Donald Trump-appointed executive director Richard Grenell, who elaborated on the difficulties surrounding exclusivity agreements.\n\n“Having an exclusive relationship has been extremely expensive and limiting in choice and variety,” Grenell wrote on X. “We approached the Opera leadership last year with this idea and they began to be open to it.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, he wrote, “The exclusive Opera contract cost the Trump Kennedy Center $64 million over the last 10 years—with their expenses being double their revenues.”\n\n“We were very pleased that the current Opera leadership was so willing to end their exclusivity,” he noted.\n\nThe New York Times report states that the decision to sever ties was made by the Washington National Opera, with the board of trustees approving a resolution on Friday that will enable the group to terminate its agreement with the venue.\n\n“Today, the Washington National Opera announced its decision to seek an amicable early termination of its affiliation agreement with the Kennedy Center and resume operations as a fully independent nonprofit entity,” a statement provided to The New York Times said.\n\nOpera officials told the paper that new venues in Washington D.C. have been lined up but that no leases have been signed. They declined to name specific venues.\n\nWith the passing of the resolution, the WNO will now seek to move its performances out of the center’s opera house and reduce the number of performances staged there.\n\nThe decision marks the end of a partnership between the Kennedy Center and the WNO that dates back to 1971.\n\nWhile the WNO did not mention the Kennedy Center’s MAGA rebrand as the reason for its departure, they have noted disagreements with new requirements that have been made under the cultural center’s new management.\n\nSeveral well-known performers have canceled planned events since President Donald Trump’s takeover of the center, which saw him fire the board in order to populate it with his allies and install himself as chair.\n\nTrump further ignited tensions when he attempted to rebrand the center to bear his name, ignoring the fact that any formal change requires congressional action. A lawsuit was filed shortly after, challenging the rebrand.\n\nIn response to Trump’s actions, several artists have canceled planned appearances at the performing arts venue, including comedian Issa Rae, folk act Rhiannon Giddens, musician Kristy Lee, trumpeter Wayne Tucker, and Grammy-winning bluegrass performer Béla Fleck.\n\nOn Thursday, singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos canceled her Feb. 7 performance at the Kennedy Center, citing her Mexican heritage and the Trump administration’s immigration policies as the reasons behind her decision.\n\n“As an artist, I treasure the freedom to create and share my music, and for many years I have used this privilege to uplift the stories of immigrants in this country,” the Grammy-nominated musician wrote on Thursday. “Unfortunately, I do not feel that the current climate at this beloved venue represents a welcoming space for myself, my band, or our audience.”",

    "description": "Former New York Times writer Harvey Araton's novel reveals a raucous life of a youth athlete, and lessons we can all learn from it.",
    "fullText": "It’s a statement but also a question we can ask ourselves as sports parents.\n\nIt’s driven into our kids very early, often by us.\n\nOr is it to just enjoy the experience?\n\n“Dad, according to Mom, asked the parents in our group not to worry about how good we were, or weren’t,” writes author Harvey Araton, through the eyes of a kid named “Z,” in a new middle-grade novel.\n\nZ’s dad was the coach of the boy’s first soccer team. It’s a neighborhood collection of grade school buddies. Dad didn’t just roll out the ball, though. He orchestrated drills that mimicked game situations that gave everyone a shot at the action.\n\n“You scrimmage too much, and the same kids, the stronger players, will dominate the ball, and then how do the other kids get better?” Z overhears his dad telling his mom early in the book.\n\nEveryone notices, in fiction and reality, when others don’t have this growth mentality.\n\nZ and his teammates hear opposing parents scream for blood, or at least a foul, when his team, once a doormat, incrementally starts to get better and begins to dominate.\n\nThe kids of manic youth sports parents, one of whom Araton admits to once being himself, is whom he wants to reach. The veteran sportswriter, most recently with The New York Times for 25 years, covered the Danny Almonte age scandal at the 2001 Little League World Series, and the ensuing escalation of Little League World Series coverage into American living rooms.\n\nHe has pondered or written about (or both) kids choosing between club and high school soccer and early sports specialization.\n\nHe also played the role of sports dad to two now-grown sons (36 and 32).\n\n“Kids learn playing sports,” Araton tells USA TODAY Sports. “I think there's a joy in that. I just feel, especially at these early years, it's becoming infected with this ambition that there could be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and I think too many parents become obsessed with turning their children into potential cash machines.”\n\nAraton launched the book last week with a signing at his local bookstore in Montclair, New Jersey. He made sure to also include a panel discussion about youth sports. He spoke with us about how his novel imitates the raucous life America lives within it, and the lessons he has gleaned from it.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nAraton is from Staten Island, which he describes as New York City’s last developed borough. It still has large swaths of parks and fields, where his story is set.\n\nHe had grown up on the basketball courts near his public housing development. The free play felt natural as it took him to the local Jewish community center and high school. He eventually played at a health club in Brooklyn as an adult and even worked in Madison Square Garden, where he covered the Knicks, the team he had idolized as a kid.\n\nHis competitive juices carried him into fatherhood when his older son, Alex, was in first grade and had the option of going out for a travel team. It’s a decision many of us have faced.\n\n“I remember asking him if he wanted to try out,” Araton says. “And he was kind of a naturally cautious kid and said, ‘Not really,’ and I remember being disappointed, a little deflated. Maybe I already was thinking, ‘If he doesn't go into this next level, he'll fall behind and never catch up, (and) there will go any chance of playing in high school.’ I mean, I could look at my kids, look at their size even at that age and know that they weren't likely to be D1 college athletes.\n\n“But I remember being disappointed and over the next couple of weeks, I came up with five or six different ways to pose the same question. Well, Nick's trying out, you sure you don't want (to)? And he kept saying no. And then the last time that I asked, he said, ‘No, dad.’ And then he looked at me and said, ‘But if I don't play travel, can I still play in the town league?’\n\n“And I remember feeling this sensation of shame because I realized in that moment that I was projecting my own ambitions and my own sports values onto this 6-year-old kid. And all he wanted to do at that point in his life was just run around and play with a bunch of kids he knew and maybe take one or two things out of any game and feel good about himself and look forward to the snacks.”\n\nThe book’s central character, who tells the story in the first person, is a combination of Araton’s two sons. Charly, Alex’s younger brother, was 4-foot-11 when he entered high school but played on the basketball team for four years.\n\nZ is left-footed with really good field vision like Alex and he’s small and feisty like Charly was. It doesn’t seem to bother Z when his young team is losing because he knows he will celebrate the things they all did well, or at least enjoyed, at Big Mitch’s restaurant afterward.\n\nBig Mitch is the father of his friend and teammate, Lloyd.\n\n“You only let in, like, seven or eight goals on an undefeated travel team,” he tells Lloyd, the team’s goalie, in the book. “Do you think a kid who was out of shape could do that?”\n\nZ becomes less comfortable when sports becomes more and more competitive. His father has a horrific accident and the team eventually gets a coach from England, who adopts a similar skills-first mindset with the kids. Kevin, the coach, who has also had a traumatic experience with his father, takes Z under his wing.\n\nAs the boys and girls on the team continue to rise in competition level, and travel further and further away from Staten Island, Z gets a much more transactional coach.\n\nHe feels himself immersed in a world over which he has less and less control, similar to the experiences Araton observed and felt as a soccer dad.\n\n“The reason why I chose soccer is because I probably was most closely involved with that, whether it was as coaching them in the early grades or just being at the games and kind of like, living for it a little bit,” he says. “I understand why parents are so heavily involved. After a week of work you really look forward to the experience of the games. It's like an adrenaline rush but also I think, it created a whole social network with the parents of their teammates and friends and everything. So I get the temptation, and the seductiveness, of it all, but (it) all got completely out of control, as well.”\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nWhile Araton was growing up on Staten Island, the borough’s Mid-Island Little League won it all in Williamsport. Years later, as a sportswriter, Araton caught up with Danny Yaccarino, who came within one strike of a perfect game during that 1964 Little League World Series against Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nHe wrote a column, (‘After Perfection at the Age of 12, What's Next?’) detailing how Yaccarino became a very good high school pitcher and reached the Baltimore Orioles organization and yet, he was always haunted by the feeling of coming so close to near-perfection as a Little Leaguer and not getting it.\n\n“Not only did he get a lot of bench jockeying and all that stuff throughout his career, but he also put incredible pressure on himself,” Araton says. “He turned out to be a minor league pitcher and he never went very far. But he told me that he finished his career feeling like an abject failure.”\n\nZ feels an emptiness, too, at the climax of the book. It's a feeling that can be induced by us.\n\n\"Parents, being vulnerable, and easily manipulated into spending vast sums of money, (wind) up treating their children like they are speculating on a stock, an investment,\" Araton says. \"They're not stocks that will pay off at 8 or 9 or 10 years; they're developing human beings.\"\n\n“Z, we’re running behind,” his mother yells upstairs, trying to get him moving for his U-13 fall season-opening game. She’s now the team’s driven parent-manager.\n\n“The construction of this story is really about Z coming to an understanding of what role sports should play in his life,” Araton says. “And when I say that, I mean, at that particular time, kids are always subject to change. He's at a point in his life where he's experienced family trauma, and, when he looks around, he doesn't see the friends who he loves, the kids that he grew up playing with. He sees a lot of strange kids. And that's not what he wants. More than playing at an elite level, he wants to play with kids who know him, who know what he's gone through.\n\n“He realizes that he still loves the game, but will only play it under his terms.”\n\nIsn’t that what we all want? What about our kids, too?\n\n“You could offer them the higher-level stuff,” Araton says, “but if it's being forced upon them, and if you're calling up to their bedroom every time there's practice, then it's clear that they don't really want to do it.\n\n“I wouldn't deny an exceptional child that kind of pathway any more than you would, say, if you had a child who (was) a mathematical genius or a classical violinist, you would want them to have the best teachers to best capitalize on their special talent. But the temptation is so great because sports is the most visible thing in the community. …\n\n\"It'll become pretty obvious to a parent if they have someone special. But this whole notion that they can create one by spending significant sums of money, I think it's really overstated.”\n\nAraton points to another interview he did, with Yael Averbuch, the general manager of the New Jersey/New York Gotham FC of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). She played for an exclusive club team in high school, won two national championships playing for the University of North Carolina and was drafted professionally.\n\nHer mother said she never had to yell upstairs for practice. Yael was the one yelling to them.\n\nAraton’s sons, like Z, had to figure out where sports fit into their lives. It worked out for them, too.\n\nAlex, who played high school soccer, is a special education teacher and Charly, the high school basketball player (who has grown to about 5-foot-9 today), works in marketing strategies for a fashion brand. He still plays in men’s leagues.\n\nAraton says those middle-grade age groups – 8 to 12, give or take – are the ages where people know the least amount about who their children are as athletes.\n\n“Don’t be disappointed if at the age of 8, they are not willing to do all this stuff and make all that sacrifice,” he says. “They might be ready when they're 11. Kids do things on their own time schedules. So just accept who they are and let them experience sports in the way they want to. They’ll enjoy it more and get more out of it.\n\n“If they're not playing for the idea of feeling good about themselves, about learning to be a coachable kid, and be a good teammate, to play with kids from all different backgrounds and develop their skills at the fundamental level at the age of 7, 8, 9, 10,” Araton says, “then they're playing for the wrong reasons.\n\n“Each shall develop at their own rate. I just think that parents have to chill and let the kids experience it for themselves.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "fullText": "New York Giants fans have experienced growing frustration over the past decade as the once-successful organization has regressed into one of the league's worst. That frustration has led to some protests, including various banners demanding change being flown over MetLife Stadium.\n\nOther fans have taken their anger directly to the desk of Giants co-owner John Mara, writing him letters of disgust -- something he, like his late father, will often read and respond to, personally.\n\nThat frustration continued to grow in 2025, but with one caveat: In September, Mara revealed he had been diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"I have recently been diagnosed with cancer and have been following the treatment plan recommended by an outstanding team of doctors,\" Mara said in a statement. \"I'm feeling strong and optimistic, and I'm committed to seeing this through to a positive outcome.\n\n\"I plan to remain active with the team throughout my treatment, and I'm fortunate to be surrounded by incredible support -- personally, professionally, and medically. I ask that you respect my privacy and my family’s privacy at this time.\"\n\nAs he battled cancer, Mara was less visible around the team.

    "description": "Chrissy Traore and her husband Ben started a bakery in New York. When they needed more space, they turned to shipping containers as the solution.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chrissy Traore, 41, who opened See & Be Kitchen with her husband Ben Salif Traore in Cairo, New York, about 40 miles from Albany, New York. When their business expanded quickly, they began running parts of it out of shipping containers on their property. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBen and I met while I was a chef and he was a baker. We worked at the same restaurant — they had a bakery and a restaurant right next door, and I was their pizza chef and he was their head baker. I had to mix my pizza dough in his mixer and that's kind of how we met.\n\nBefore, I worked on Madison Avenue in marketing and brand strategy, and in 2008, the economy crashed and my job crashed too. When that happened, I moved into food. I took a job on an ice cream truck and just fell in love with food work.\n\nI was in the food industry in various ways in New York City from about 2008 until 2017.\n\nWhile working in the industry, I was unhappy with the way that they treated employees. I was in management at the time, so I could see the full round numbers.\n\nI thought, \"There has to be a better way, but it's not my job to change this business owner or this business.\"\n\nBen and I talked a lot about it, and we were going upstate frequently — I was working at a place upstate as their first chef.\n\nI said, \"We should really move upstate.\" It's more our speed. We like the outdoors. We like having space. The quality of life is better. We love farming and being close to what's happening on the ground, literally. In 2017 we said, let's get out of the city.\n\nWe didn't have a ton of money, and we had to be scrappy and thoughtful about how we deployed the resources that we had saved. We wanted a place where we could live and work, so we wanted property and land — that was important to us.\n\nWe found a property in Cairo, New York, and it had been a bar and a hotel, so it was already grandfathered in on DOH, and had some structures there. We have 11 acres, and the house was practically falling apart, so we could afford it. We paid $189,900, and that was it. We went all in.\n\nWe knew we wanted to open our own place and we were trying to discover what that was. We knew it would involve Ben's bread and my cooking.\n\nWe started renovating the property and doing farmers markets, and that's how we got to know the community that we were in.\n\nWe came in quietly, like, \"Let's see what's already here and get to know people before we just bash them over the head with what we do.\" Let's see what they want, because ultimately we're entering a community that's not necessarily ours yet.\n\nWe were moving from Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn, and part of the reason we moved out was we saw that happening. People were moving in and they would say, \"We need to fix this. This is broken.\" And I'm like, \"What is broken? This is a wonderful community. Please stop.\"\n\nSometime in 2018, we turned into See & Be. Then, from there, we really got some traction at farmers markets.\n\nWe were doing porch pickups — people could pick up their orders at a local massage therapist's house — so we had started operating, but we didn't have a physical space yet.\n\nWe were still building out the cafe in the very small already existing structure on our property. We had one oven, with one proofer, a little cooktop that I would do the sandwiches on, and a coffee station with this beautiful wooden bar that people could sit at. And we opened that in February of 2019. Ben baked everything; I ran the front of house.\n\nWe had a five-year plan and it went into overdrive. Soon, we needed more space, and I could not get a building up fast enough. With traditional buildings, we looked at it and we thought it was going to take a year and a half to two years. We couldn't do that. We needed space like tomorrow.\n\nI had worked for a company while in Brooklyn that was actually my first shipping container job. That was at the DeKalb Market, and it was all built out of shipping containers.\n\nI realized there was no way to get a building through the planning board and everything quickly enough — but I could get a shipping container.\n\nI looked at Ben and I said, \"The fastest way we can do this is to get a shipping container.\" And he said, \"Are you kidding?\" I said, \"No.\"\n\nWe really bootstrapped our business from day one. We had a $10,000 investment in building out the space over time. We costed it out, and we could afford it with what we had already made in the business.\n\nWe got our approval and I was so excited. I posted it on our Facebook page and we got over 4,000 interactions. We couldn't not open.\n\nOur first shipping container was a regular shipping container — a 40' by 20' high cube. We placed it on wooden rail ties, which was not great — those degraded over the years, especially with heavy usage.\n\nWe thought of ourselves as scrappy: \"Well, we did the cafe, we can do this ourselves. So why would I pay to have a spray foam? We'll do that ourselves.\" That was terrible idea.\n\nI think we bought every spray foam insulation canister in a 200-mile radius of here from Home Depot and Lowe's. We didn't know what we were doing. We were just trying to figure it out. The walls were uneven and it worked, but it wasn't a great solution.\n\nThen we pushed out of that shipping container and needed even more space. At that point, we needed more cold storage. I started doing more research into shipping containers and came across decommissioned reefers.\n\nThey're pre-insulated and have steel walls. And unlike a regular shipping container that has a wood floor, this has a steel flat floor. So it's already food-ready.\n\nWe bought the first container for $6,000 painted and delivered. And then we spent another couple thousand dollars in spray foam. God only knows how much the labor was, because we did it ourselves and that took forever.\n\nWe have running water and electric in the containers, but most of the mixing happens in our original building.\n\nThat following year, as our business grew and began to quickly scale, we kept outgrowing our space and needing more and more room. Once we saw how quickly we could get a shipping container in place — about a month — it was easy to go, \"OK, well, gee, trucks can double my space in a month.\"\n\nThe second container was much faster and easier to set up. I bought that directly through a broker at the port. We paid $8,500 for that one.\n\nWhen we installed the second container, we leveled the ground, put in concrete pillars, and the cranes came in and moved the original container and did that whole process. Then, with the third container, it was very easy to attach it because the ground was already graded and leveled.\n\nIt cost about $7,500 to $15,000 per container at the end of the day, because we had to get the crane to get them moved, and we had to get them welded together.\n\nIt's always funny when someone comes up to the building for the first time, and they're just like, \"What is this? Where is the bakery?\" And then they knock on a shipping container door.\n\nPeople are always shook to see that it's a real production. They think we're winging this or pretending because there's these shipping containers. But when you walk in, you forget you're in a shipping container.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A judge’s ruling that a Trump administration prosecutor in upstate New York was serving unlawfully has spilled into another case — with the same judge saying he can’t obtain tax return information in a criminal investigation because he lacks authority.\n\nThe ruling Thursday against prosecutor John Sarcone from U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield came the same day the judge disqualified Sarcone from overseeing investigations into Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. In that case, Schofield ruled that Sarcone was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York and that any “of his past or future acts taken in that capacity are void or voidable.”\n\nSarcone is among the prosecutors around the country found by federal judges to lack authority after the Republican administration used unusual maneuvers to place them or keep them in their posts without U.S. Senate confirmation.\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, said Schofield's ruling was consistent with previous decisions.\n\n“It does seem like more and more courts are coming around to this view,” he said.\n\nIn a separate ruling Thursday, Schofield denied Sarcone's application for a court order directing the IRS to disclose tax return information for a limited liability company as part of a criminal investigation. The application remains sealed and it's not clear who filed the tax returns sought in the Oct. 2 request.\n\nApplications for that tax information can only be made by officials holding specific positions, such as U.S. attorneys. The Manhattan judge said Sarcone lacked authority to authorize the application because he was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney — mirroring her reasoning in the case involving James.\n\nAn email seeking comment was sent to the northern district.\n\nCourts in New Jersey, Nevada and California have held that similarly installed acting U.S. attorneys lacked lawful authority. Trump’s former personal attorney, Alina Habba,resigned as the top federal prosecutor for New Jersey in December after an appeals court said she had been serving unlawfully.",

    "description": "The president uses digital media to get his message across — but he really loves old media like newspapers and cable TV.",
    "fullText": "Last fall, Donald Trump filed a $15 billion defamation suit against The New York Times. That suit is still ongoing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sat down with Times reporters at the White House for a 2-hour interview, where he expounded on his worldview, conducted an off-the-record conversation with the president of Colombia, and showed off new plans to renovate the West Wing.\n\nIf that surprises you, it shouldn't. Trump, and the rest of his administration, love to complain about the Times and other big, mainstream media outfits. They also love talking to them.\n\nEarlier this week, for instance, key Trump advisor Stephen Miller appeared on CNN for a much-discussed interview with Jake Tapper, where he laid out a bellicose view of America's role in the world.\n\nA few days before that, Trump talked to The Wall Street Journal — another publication he's currently suing — for a story about his health and fitness.\n\nAnd last month Vanity Fair published a lengthy profile of Susie Wiles, Trump's chief of staff, which involved multiple interviews with Wiles and portraits of her and other Trump officials, including Miller, Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nTrump has made mainstream media a target since he started running for president in 2015, calling reports he doesn't like \"fake news,\" and labeling journalists \"enemies of the people.\" He's called for a change in US libel law, so he can more easily punish journalists, and he often insists that TV networks that irk him should have their broadcast licenses revoked.\n\nAnd his rhetoric and actions have ramped up in his second term, where he has banned the Associated Press from events in the Oval Office, stocked the White House briefing room with Trump-friendly outlets, and pushed out all mainstream reporters from the Pentagon.\n\nAll of that should worry anyone who cares about press freedom — or in less lofty terms, the ability of the press to accurately tell you what's happening in the federal government.\n\nThe flip of that is quite simple: Trump is a man who grew up in a world dominated by traditional media — newspapers and television — and he still cares very much about what traditional media says about him, no matter what he says. That's why he delights in constant press appearances in the White House, aboard Air Force One, and anywhere else reporters have cameras, microphones, and notepads.\n\nI often think of an AP photo from last spring, shortly after he'd announced his initial, chaotic tariff plan, that shows him perusing the New York Post's coverage of that plan in the back of his limousine. We focus a lot of attention on Trump's ability to use Twitter, YouTube, podcasts, and other digital media to shape public perception. But he's very much an old media guy — print, broadcast, cable.\n\nAnd as long as those things still exist, Trump will want to be in them and flattered by their coverage. Which explains why he can sue them and invite them into his office at the same time.",

    "title": "I run alcohol-free nightlife events in NYC. Most of my guests aren't sober — they just don't want to drink.",
    "description": "Sam Bail, the founder of Bright Nights Social, told Business Insider that demand is booming for her alcohol-free nightlife events in New York.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Bail, a data engineer and the founder of the alcohol-free pop-up event company, Bright Nights Social. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThree years ago, I had the idea to open an alcohol-free bar in New York City.\n\nI don't drink, but I still wanted nightlife — dancing, music, meeting new people, getting out of the house on a Friday or Saturday night. What I didn't want was another alcohol-free space that was centered on wellness, meditation, or yoga. I wanted something that still felt like real nightlife, just without booze being the main event.\n\nInstead of signing a lease, I started testing the idea by hosting pop-up events. I'd take over coffee shops or other venues at night and turn them into alcohol-free bars for the evening.\n\nWhat started as an experiment quickly took on a life of its own.\n\nOver the past three years, I've collaborated with tons of venues, experimented with a variety of new formats, and thousands of people have come through our doors. That's been the most surprising part of all of this: the demand.\n\nWhat's even more interesting? Most of the people who attend my events aren't even sober.\n\nWhen people hear \"alcohol-free event,\" they often assume the crowd is made up entirely of sober or sober-curious people. That hasn't been my experience at all. Based on conversations with guests, I estimate that at least 75% of the people who attend my events don't identify as sober or even sober-curious.\n\nThey're mostly in their mid-20s to early 30s — older Gen Z and very young millennials. Gender splits depend on the event, but many of my parties are close to 50-50 men and women. What they have in common is that they want to go out, socialize, and have fun without making drinking the center of their entire social life.\n\nI'm 40, so I'm an elder millennial who's already done the heavy partying phase and is over it. But many of the people who come to Bright Nights Social are younger than me and feel the same way. They'll tell me things like, \"I still drink sometimes, I just don't want to do it every time I go out,\" or \"Alcohol makes me feel terrible the next day.\"\n\nThey're not abstaining out of moral opposition to alcohol or because of addiction. They're opting out because they don't like the cost, the hangovers, or the way drinking dominates social life in cities like New York.\n\nWhat I see aligns with a broader shift happening right now, especially among younger people. There's a growing focus on experiences rather than just going to a bar and spending money on drinks. In New York City, you can see it everywhere: pottery classes, cooking classes, rug tufting, late-night library events, group reading clubs.\n\nSome of my favorites have been hosting cooking classes and our crafting events, like rug-making. Coming up this month, we have a tea bar, a bagel-making (and eating!) class, and a full-on dance party, complete with DJs and a full non-alcoholic bar, to close out Dry January.\n\nPeople want to do something. They want to make memories. They just don't want to wake up feeling awful the next day.\n\nCost is also a big factor. When cocktails are $15 or $20 each, it doesn't take long for a casual night out to become extremely expensive. A lot of people tell me they'd rather spend their money on an experience than on alcohol that doesn't even make them feel good.\n\nThat doesn't mean Gen Z isn't drinking at all. In fact, some recent data suggests younger people are actually drinking more now than they were a year or two ago. I think part of that is a post-pandemic catch-up effect — many Gen Zers reached legal drinking age during lockdowns and simply didn't have the chance to go out.\n\nWhat I see on the ground is moderation. People might have one drink at dinner and then switch to a nonalcoholic beer. Or they'll alternate between alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks throughout the night — what some people call \"zebra striping.\" They're being much more intentional about how and when they drink.\n\nAnother huge shift I'm seeing is the role of legal THC. I don't serve THC products at my events, but I don't stop anyone from having one before they come, and I hear about them constantly from guests and friends who work at nonalcoholic bottle shops. THC drinks are some of the best-selling products in those stores.\n\nPeople understand what THC does. They say it helps with social anxiety, takes the edge off, and feels more manageable than alcohol when used in moderation. Compared to that, there's still skepticism around functional or adaptogenic drinks — things with nootropics, ashwagandha, or functional mushrooms. Many people aren't convinced that those drinks actually do anything beyond being a placebo.\n\nThat said, I think we're still early. As people learn what works for their own bodies — whether that's L-theanine, lion's mane, or something else — those functional beverages may gain more traction.\n\nAt the same time, I'm also seeing conversations online about people pulling back from THC after overdoing it, so I think we'll see a similar trend as people try to find nightlife events that best suit their needs.\n\nI don't think most people want to be completely sober forever, but they are actively experimenting with what moderation looks like.\n\nThe biggest misconception about alcohol-free nightlife is that it's boring or restrictive. What I've learned is that people don't want to be told what not to do — they just want more options.\n\nBright Nights Social isn't about sobriety as an identity. It's about creating a space where alcohol isn't the default. You can still dance, flirt, meet strangers, and stay out late. The only difference is that you're not expected to drink to participate.\n\nThe fact that so many non-sober people show up tells me this isn't a niche idea anymore. Alcohol-free nightlife isn't just for people who've quit drinking entirely. It's for anyone who wants to go out — and wake up the next day feeling like themselves.\n\nDo you host or attend alternative nightlife events? Contact this reporter at ktl@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Nearly 16,000 nurses set to join union-led strike Monday to demand large hospitals across NYC ‘put patients over profit’",
    "fullText": "Nearly 16,000 nurses in New York City are set to strike on Monday amid a battle over pay during contract negotiations.\n\nThe action, due to take place across five large hospitals, is being organized by the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA), which is demanding the hospitals put patients over profit.\n\nThe hospitals insist they continue to bargain in good faith, and have accused the union of trying to disrupt patient care.\n\nCEO compensation at three hospitals – Montefiore, Mount Sinai, and New York Presbyterian – is nearly 12,000 times more than that of the average nurse, according to the union.\n\nNancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, who has worked at Maimonides medical center in Brooklyn for over 30 years, told the Guardian that the hospitals are pushing to scale back safe staffing ratios, refusing to guarantee healthcare benefit coverage for nurses, and declining to address workplace safety issues.\n\nThree of the major hospitals involved in contract negotiations have $1.6bn cash or cash equivalent on hand, according to the union, which said they have already started hiring travel nurses to replace those striking in preparation for a strike.\n\n“What we are asking them is to take those millions and invest it into the community so we could continue to work to care for our patients, invest it into staffing, invest those millions into our medical coverage so we could come to work,” said Hagans. “We’re not taking this lightly. We’re not asking to strike. Management is the one who’s telling us that we need to strike. They are the ones putting us on the picket line.”\n\nShe cited safety issues that stem from a drastic increase of assaults on healthcare workers since the Covid-19 pandemic, and an active shooter incident at Mount Sinai last November, where three nurses were reportedly disciplined for speaking out afterwards.\n\n“The large, wealthy hospitals are much better off financially than they were three years ago, but yet they’re asking for takeaways,” claimed Hagans. “They told us to choose between our wages or keeping our healthcare and safe staffing, because we cannot have it all. The safety of a patient should never be a bargaining chip. Nurses will not cut corners on patients and their safety. Nurses are just demanding that New York City private hospitals put patients over profit.”\n\nNurses represented by NYSNA issued 10-day strike notices on 2 January at a string of New York hospitals. On Tuesday, seven of the smaller hospitals moved forward in contract negotiations, with the union rescinding their strike notice.\n\nAbout 1,000 nurses at three Northwell hospitals in Long Island have also issued strike notices.\n\n“Our nurses have been at the bargaining table since September 2025 with little to no movement,” said Simone Way, a member of the NYSNA executive committee, and a nurse at Mount Sinai Morningside hospital. “Even though we started this process in September, there have been committees in the hospital having these same discussions on staffing since January 2025, so it’s no surprise to our management the things nurses feel we need.”\n\nWay also criticized hospital management’s efforts to blame the strike on nurses, claiming they are putting patients at risk and asking for too much. “They do have the money, but they don’t appear to be willing to invest that money in their nurses or into the ability for us to provide the best care humanly possible to our patients,” she said.\n\nMount Sinai denied retaliation claims against nurses following November’s active-shooter incident, and denied attempting to take away healthcare benefits for nurses. A spokesperson said: “We are continuing to bargain in good faith in the hopes of reaching an agreement that is fair, reasonable, and responsible, but unfortunately just a week before a potential strike NYSNA has refused to move off of its extreme economic proposals that demand hospitals like ours spend billions of dollars on increased nursing compensation and additional hires.”\n\nThey claimed “most of the union’s claims about bargaining are untrue”, and confirmed that the hospital is taking steps to prepare in case of a strike.\n\nNew York Presbyterian blamed the union for not budging on wages. “NYSNA’s threatened strike is intended to disrupt patient care across the city,” a spokesperson said. “We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that our patients will continue to receive safe, exceptional care. We will always meet our fundamental obligation to the communities we serve.”\n\nMontefiore did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "GUATIRE, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela released citizens and foreigners from its prisons on Thursday in what a top government official described as a gesture to “seek peace” less than a week after former President Nicolás Maduro was captured by U.S. forces to face federal drug-trafficking charges in New York.\n\nJorge Rodríguez, brother of acting President Delcy Rodríguez and head of the National Assembly, said a “significant number” of people would be freed, but he was not specific about how many or provide names.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have freed political prisoners before, but the releases on Thursday were the first since Maduro was deposed. Human rights groups were encouraged by the releases, though it wasn’t clear yet whether this might represent the early stages of a government in transition or was more of a symbolic effort to please the Trump administration, which has allowed Maduro’s loyalists to stay in control even as it exerts political pressure through crippling sanctions.\n\nJournalists, lawyers and human rights activists were among those freed on Thursday, and families waited outside a notorious prison in hopes their loved ones would be among the detainees released.\n\n“Consider this a gesture by the Bolivarian government, which is broadly intended to seek peace,” Rodríguez said in an announcement publicized over TV.\n\nNGO: 863 detained for ‘political reasons’\n\nAlfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, an advocacy group for prisoners based in Caracas, praised Thursday’s release as “good news” that lifted Venezuelans’ hopes that all political detainees in the country may walk free.\n\nBut he stressed that he wanted this to become “the beginning of the dismantling of the repressive system” of Maduro’s government and not remain “a mere gesture, a charade of releasing some prisoners and incarcerating others.”\n\nDespite a widespread crackdown during the tumultuous 2024 election – in which the government said it detained 2,000 people – Venezuela's government denies that there are “political prisoners” and accuses those detained of plotting to destabilize Maduro’s government.\n\nRomero's organization said that as of Dec. 29, 2025, there were 863 people detained in Venezuela “for political reasons.”\n\nThe Spanish government announced Thursday that five Spanish citizens were among those released in Venezuela and would soon return to Spain.\n\nForeign Minister José Manuel Albares confirmed the group includes prominent Venezuelan-Spanish lawyer and human rights activist Rocío San Miguel. Speaking to Spanish broadcaster RNE, he also confirmed that Spanish citizens Andrés Martínez, José María Basoa, Ernesto Gorbe and Miguel Moreno were freed.\n\nBasoa and Martínez were arrested in Venezuela in September 2024, accused by officials of being involved in a plot to destabilize Maduro’s government as Spanish intelligence agents, allegations that Spanish authorities denied at the time. Spain’s El País newspaper reported Thursday that Gorbe had been living in Venezuela and was arrested in 2024, accused of being in the country illegally with an expired visa.\n\nA number of families of those detained rushed to wait outside of a number of Venezuelan prisons on Thursday, hoping to reunite with their loved ones.\n\nPedro Durán, 60, was among those hoping to wrap his arm around his brother Franklin Durán as he waited outside a prison in the town of Guatire, around 25 miles (43 kilometers) outside of Caracas. Durán said his brother was detained in 2021 on charges of trying to overthrow Maduro’s government — an accusation the family fiercely denies.\n\nDurán, who has been living in Spain, heard rumors that the government may be releasing a number of detainees on Wednesday and immediately bought a plane ticket from Madrid to Caracas to find his brother.\n\n“I don’t have words to express the emotion I’m feeling,” Durán said. “We’re feeling a lot of hope ... We’re just waiting now.”\n\nDespite the anticipation, fear persists in parts of the South American country as residents brace for an uncertain future.\n\n“Of course everyone here is very scared, but what more could (the government) do to us that they haven’t done already,” he said.\n\nRonal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuelan Observatory at the University of Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia, said the government periodically releases prisoners at politically strategic moments.\n\nIn July last year, Venezuela released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in exchange for getting home more than 200 migrants deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador, where they were held in a prison built to hold alleged gang members.\n\n“The regime uses them (prisoners) like a bargaining chip,” he said, adding that he and other observers will be watching not just how many people the government releases, but also whether high-profile individuals are included or if they're being released under a condition of house arrest.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration sought to assert its control over Venezuelan oil, seizing a pair of sanctioned tankers transporting petroleum and announcing plans to relax some sanctions so the U.S. can oversee the sale of Venezuela’s petroleum worldwide.\n\nBoth moves reflect the administration’s determination to make good on its effort to control the next steps in Venezuela through its vast oil resources after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged after the capture of Maduro that the U.S. will “run” the country.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "title": "New York Jets - Picking 16: A Preliminary View",
    "description": "An Early Look At The Four Most Mocked Players The Jets Could Select With The 16th Pick",
    "fullText": "Well, the season is over. The tank is complete, and after weeks of speculation, the Jets will be picking No. 2 overall.\n\nAt No. 2, there are still plenty of questions about what direction they take. If Dante Moore declares, the debate will almost certainly center on whether the Jets go quarterback, trade back, or simply take the best player on the board. That discussion is fairly straightforward and will dominate much of the early draft conversation.\n\nHowever, there’s another pick the Jets own that isn’t getting nearly the same level of attention.\n\nThanks to the Colts’ collapse down the stretch and their failure to make the playoffs, the pick they traded to the Jets now lands in the top half of the draft. For a team with holes all over the roster, that’s a massive asset.\n\nWe’ll dive much deeper into these prospects as we get closer to April, and it’s important to note that draft boards can change rapidly between January and draft night. But for now, let’s take a brief look at the four most popular players players mocked to the Jets with this pick:\n\nBailey immediately emerges as a popular potential target for the Jets.\n\nA four-year senior who began his career at Stanford before transferring to Texas Tech, Bailey has been on draft radars for the better part of the last two years. However, it was his senior season that truly launched his draft stock. After entering the year viewed as more of a mid–second-round prospect, Bailey has climbed to consensus No. 11 overall on most big boards.\n\nThe book on Bailey is fairly simple: he’s an elite college pass rusher.\n\nAfter two solid seasons at Stanford, Bailey took a major leap in his junior year, becoming one of the highest-graded pass rushers in the country. With a larger national stage at Texas Tech, he only continued that ascent, arguably becoming the most dominant pass rusher in college football this past season. With better coverage behind him, his sack total also exploded with 15 sacks this past year.\n\nBailey is the highest-graded pass rusher in the country on both true pass sets and overall snaps. He leads the nation in PRP—a PFF metric that combines sacks, hits, and hurries relative to pass-rush opportunities—and also ranks first in win rate on true pass sets, measuring how often he beats his blocker on non-penalty pass-rush snaps.\n\nThe athletic profile jumps off the page as well. Bailey is fast, explosive, and incredibly productive. He reportedly bench-pressed 405 pounds, squatted 550, and has been clocked at 22.16 mph. There’s a lot to like.\n\nThe concerns, however, are also easy to spot.\n\nBailey is undersized, listed at 250 pounds (a number that appears generous given he doesn’t look much different from the 240 pounds he was listed at during his Stanford days). That size raises legitimate questions about his ability to set the edge, hold up against the run, and rein in some of his more reckless tendencies.\n\nUltimately, there are two very different ways to view Bailey depending on the story you are going to tell yourself. On one hand, you’re getting a freaky, explosive, highly productive pass rusher, something the Jets desperately need. On the other, you may be drafting a situational edge defender who can’t consistently stay on the field for all three downs due to size limitations.\n\nWith Will McDonald already on the roster and facing similar concerns, it remains to be seen whether the Jets would be willing to take another swing on this type of profile.\n\nKeldric Faulk:\n\nWe’ll continue the trend of examining potential pass rushers at pick No. 16, but this one couldn’t be more different from David Bailey.\n\nKeldric Faulk is a specimen. If you were designing an NFL edge rusher in a lab, it would look a lot like Faulk. He stands 6’6”, carries long arms, and weighs in at 285 pounds a drastically different body type than the Jets’ current edge rushers in Will McDonald and Jermaine Johnson.\n\nFaulk is also a completely different type of player than Bailey. While Bailey lined up almost exclusively outside the offensive tackle, Faulk has been used all over the front. Over the past two seasons, he’s aligned outside the tackle roughly 55–60% of the time, but Auburn has also deployed him over tackles and even inside over guards. He’s been asked to do everything.\n\nThat versatility shows up most clearly against the run. Faulk has graded extremely well in run defense, ranking in the top 25 in both stop rate and run-defense grade in each of the last two seasons. What makes that even more impressive is his age, he’s been doing this at 19 and 20 years old in the SEC.\n\nThe pass-rushing profile, however, is very much a work in progress and that’s where the concerns begin.\n\nMost notably, Faulk took a step back as a pass rusher this season. After recording nine sacks as a 19-year-old sophomore, his sack total dropped to just two this past year. His underlying metrics tell a similar story, as he ranked outside the top 50 in both pressure rate and win rate. There is an important caveat here: pressure and win rates tend to decline when a player isn’t used primarily as a stand-up edge rusher outside the tackle. Still, the pass-rush skill set clearly needs refinement.\n\nFaulk will be one of the more fascinating evaluations in this class, particularly depending on how he tests. On first glance, he appears plenty athletic (especially for his size) and it’s notable how well he already carries his frame at just 20 years old. It’s easy to see why he’s been viewed as a mid–first-round pick at worst for much of the year.\n\nThe questions, however, are largely tied to projection.\n\nThe best-case scenario is a complete edge defender: a powerful run stopper who leverages his size and athleticism into becoming a legitimate plus pass rusher at the next level. The concern is more straightforward, he never fully develops the pass-rushing tools needed to consistently win in the NFL.\n\nThat variance is what makes Faulk such a fascinating, and potentially polarizing, option for the Jets at No. 16.\n\nMoving away from edge rusher to another position of need, wide receiver will undoubtedly be one of the most talked-about spots to address in this year’s draft especially if the Jets do select a quarterback at pick No. 2. Makai Lemon, by all accounts, appears to be a very legitimate option considering where he ranks on consensus big boards. Over the last three months of the draft process, Lemon has hovered anywhere from the early 20s to as high as No. 16, where he currently sits on several boards.\n\nLemon is a fascinating evaluation. From a production standpoint, it’s hard to find many receivers as consistently productive as he’s been. After entering USC as a highly rated recruit, Lemon broke out during his sophomore season, finishing with 52 catches for 764 yards and three touchdowns on 67 targets. From an efficiency perspective, he was outstanding—posting a high catch rate while adding an elite 3.03 yards per route run.\n\nAt just 21 years old, Lemon took another leap as a junior and emerged as one of the best wide receivers in college football. He finished the season as the highest-graded receiver in the country, totaling 79 catches, 1,156 yards, and 11 touchdowns. Among qualified Power Four receivers, he ranked third nationally in yards per route run and finished top 10 in missed tackles forced, drop rate, and passer rating when targeted. Any way you slice it, Lemon was both dominant and efficient.\n\nThe main concern with Lemon, (and the first thing evaluators will point to) is his size. Listed at 5’11”, 195 pounds, Lemon spent most of his time at USC operating out of the slot. While he did expand his role this season, he still lined up outside on just 28% of his snaps.\n\nThat leads to the obvious questions: can Lemon consistently beat press man coverage at the NFL level against bigger, more physical defensive backs? And does the lack of true top-end speed (he’s rumored to run in the 4.45–4.50 range) cap his upside? Those answers will come with time.\n\nThe Jaxson Smith-Njigba comparison is going to come up frequently throughout this draft cycle given how similar their profiles are in terms of size, production, usage, and athleticism. But one thing is clear: if you’re looking for an advanced route runner with elite production, there simply aren’t many better options in this draft than Makai Lemon.\n\nWe’ll close out this article with our final player and undoubtedly the most polarizing name on the list: Peter Woods.\n\nWoods has been in the spotlight for a long time now. The buzz around him has been loud for nearly two years, dating back to when he burst onto the scene at Clemson as a true freshman. From the very beginning, Woods was a very good player.\n\nAt just 18 years old, Woods made an immediate impact. During his freshman season, while primarily playing as a 1-tech and 3-tech, he established himself as an elite run defender. He finished as a top-eight run defender in the country by PFF grade and ranked second nationally among all defensive linemen in stop rate. For an 18-year-old freshman playing in the Power Four, that level of production is remarkable.\n\nHe followed up his breakout freshman year with another strong campaign as a sophomore. Clemson used him differently, lining him up more frequently as a traditional defensive end and even placing him outside the tackles at times. As a result, his pass-rush metrics took a step forward. Despite still spending the majority of his snaps inside, Woods graded well as a pass rusher when asked to attack the quarterback. His win rate ranked top 10 nationally among non-edge rushers, and in true pass sets—albeit on a smaller sample—he finished top 15 at the position.\n\nBecause of that trajectory, Woods entered the season as a consensus top-five prospect. He also earned a spot on Bruce Feldman’s Freaks List, where Feldman wrote:\n\n“His latest body composition scans prior to camp showed that 240 of his 310 pounds are lean muscle mass. He’s a rare combination of power and speed for a 300-plus-pounder. This offseason, Woods bench pressed 490 pounds and did 34 reps of 225. He squatted 700 pounds and power cleaned 385, ran a 4.86 40-yard dash and vertical jumped 33 inches.”\n\nUnfortunately, Woods’ junior season was a clear disappointment. He moved back exclusively to the interior, and his production and grading took a noticeable step back. From a win-rate and pressure standpoint, he fell outside the top 50 among qualified defensive linemen. It’s fair to note that producing high pressure and win rates is more difficult when playing nose tackle and interior defensive line, but even accounting for alignment, his results were underwhelming compared to peers in similar roles. The dominant run defense he showed early in his career also regressed.\n\nAs a result, Woods has slid from being a consensus top-five player on big boards to someone who could legitimately fall out of the top half of the first round on draft night.\n\nWoods remains a fascinating evaluation. From a size and athleticism standpoint, he checks every box at 6’3”, 315 pounds. He’s shown flashes of high-level play as both a run defender and a pass rusher. But it’s impossible to ignore the step back in performance this past season. Simply put, he’s well behind the sack and tackle-for-loss production you’d typically expect from a defensive lineman selected in the middle of the first round. A concern to say the least.\n\nAs previously mentioned, these rankings are cyclical by nature. While these four players are the most commonly mocked to the Jets at this point in the process, it’s unlikely they’ll be the same names we’re seeing come April once testing results and additional information start to reshape boards.\n\nWe’ll continue to monitor the class and take a deeper look at all of these prospects (including those listed above) over the coming months.",

Right there. Pulitzer Prize! He got one for the bullet,” Trump said, drawing applause from the crowd.\n\n“These are the ones that take the pictures. Make me look thin for a change, Doug,” he quipped. “You’re making me look a little bit heavy. I’m not happy about it.”\n\nBut Democrats think there’s little photographers can do to help the president.\n\nNot the photographers' fault https://t.co/EI8nukJYJK pic.twitter.com/oggK2CqUXd\n\n— Democrats (@TheDemocrats) January 6, 2026\n\n“Not the photographers’ fault,” they wrote in an X post, attaching candid images of Trump taken from less-than-flattering angles.\n\nTrump, a high-flying socialite and TV personality before he entered the White House, has long been conscious of his public image.\n\nIn October, he threw a Truth Social meltdown after TIME magazine put him on the cover using a photo taken from a low angle, which highlighted the drooping skin on his neck. It didn’t help that his hair practically disappeared into the sky above him.\n\n“They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one,” Trump wrote. “Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?”\n\nThe aging president is 6’ 3” and weighs 224 pounds, according to the results of his annual physical exam released last April. His BMI puts him in the overweight category, though the president’s physician Sean Barbabella has repeatedly cleared Trump as being in “excellent health.”\n\nTrump’s fast-food-heavy diet and love for Diet Coke are unlikely to see him shed pounds soon. Florida state senator Joe Gruters once said he saw Trump eat McDonald’s fries, a Filet-O-Fish, a Quarter Pounder, and a Big Mac all in one sitting.\n\nAs for exercise, Trump doesn’t care for much physical activity outside of the golf course.\n\n“I just don’t like it. It’s boring,” Trump told The Wall Street Journal about his opinion of exercise. “To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that’s not for me.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment about the Democratic Party’s post.",

    "description": "Growing up in Fort Lauderdale and moving to New York City has taught me that the cities we dream of won't always meet our expectations, and that's OK.",
    "fullText": "For nearly 20 years of my life, I lived in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe beaches, palm trees, and Pub Subs (sub sandwiches from Publix, for those unfamiliar) that were part of other people's vacations were staples of my everyday life.\n\nMaybe that's why I started yearning for somewhere that wasn't as calm and steady as I was used to — somewhere like New York City.\n\nI visited NYC for the first time in 2016, and four visits later, I made it my goal to live there one day.\n\nEach trip welcomed me with new experiences and places to explore. Getting to walk out of my hotel with no set itinerary and discover local coffee shops or pocket parks was a feeling I genuinely believed couldn't be replicated elsewhere.\n\nUnlike my days in Florida, which sometimes felt repetitive, New York always felt fresh.\n\nSo, in July, I made the leap and moved to the Big Apple. Like other transplants in their early 20s, I wanted to feel like I was living in a place that mattered, and the city's energy was intoxicating.\n\nDay by day, since moving to New York City, I've become more aware of the realities that come with actually living in the place I dreamed of.\n\nAs a tourist, I curated my experiences, planned my trips around perfect weather, and was able to appreciate a slowed-down version of the city.\n\nBut living in the city comes with a pace that's impossible to ignore.\n\nPublic transportation is crowded, fast-paced, and something I've learned to take into account when planning my days. I've had to learn to make decisions faster, leave earlier than necessary, and accept that even the smallest disruptions can throw off my entire day.\n\nPlus, the so-called \"New York tax\" that forces me to spend at least $30 the moment I walk out the door has been a humbling dose of reality.\n\nMoments like schlepping groceries in bad weather have made me miss how South Florida provides more space to slow down, too.\n\nI used to see New York City as a fantasy, but as a resident, I'm realizing that maybe that was the version I created for the \"me\" who was just passing through.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still see New York City's appeal — just not in the ways I used to. In the same way tourists flock to the beaches I grew up on, I now see NYC as a destination people project their biggest hopes onto.\n\nAfter months of living here, I've come to realize that the mundane aspects of everyday life are what make the city feel like home, from catching an express train just before it leaves the station to waving to my building's super.\n\nAnd now, I'm able to take these lessons home to Fort Lauderdale when I visit, which I've come to see in a whole new light.\n\nOn my first trip home, the beaches I used to visit every other month, and the constant hot weather I'd tried to avoid, carried a sense of charm I had really never appreciated growing up.\n\nExperiencing it from the perspective of someone who left made me feel grateful for all the little details I used to overlook.\n\nAfter that visit, I finally understood: A place can lose its appeal once it becomes familiar, but that doesn't mean it's no longer special. A dream city may never truly live up to the images we create of it, and that's OK.\n\nI'm learning to love New York's imperfections and am enjoying rediscovering the beauty of South Florida as well.\n\nBut moreover, I'm learning to accept that home doesn't have to be a place that constantly amazes me. It's where I choose to keep building, flaws and all — and for now, that place is New York City.",

Its ranking also considered factors like housing availability, whether the city had a community of young people, the average estimated commute time, and affordability, which was weighted as one of the most important factors in Realtor.com's analysis.\n\nAffordability remains one of the largest barriers to Americans trying to break into the housing market for the first time.\n\nThe 30-year mortgage rate clocked in at around 6.15% in the last week of 2025, according to data from Freddie Mac — still elevated compared to levels over the last decade, particularly during the pandemic, when many home loans were going for under 3%.\n\nThe median sales price of a US home, meanwhile, hovered around $410,800 in the second quarter of last year, according to US Census data, close to a record high.\n\nHere are the cities where Realtor.com thinks first-time buyers could catch a break.\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 21.3%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 21 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 23\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 19.9%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 23 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 37.9\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 13.0%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 25 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 47.8\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 18.9%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 24 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 43.5\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 17.4%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 23 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 39.2\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 20.4%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 20 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 21.0\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 19.1%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 31 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 52.6\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 25.2%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 22 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 42.4\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 23.5%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 25 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 33.7\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 12.4%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 24 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 50.2",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — Pamela Smart, who is serving life in prison for orchestrating the murder of her husband by her teenage student in 1990, is seeking to overturn her conviction over what her lawyers claim were several constitutional violations.\n\nThe petition for habeas corpus relief was filed Monday in New York, where she is being held at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, and, in New Hampshire, where the murder happened.\n\n“Ms. Smart’s trial unfolded in an environment that no court had previously confronted — wall-to-wall media coverage that blurred the line between allegation and evidence,” Jason Ott, who is part of Smart’s legal team, said in a statement. “This petition challenges whether a fair adversarial process took place.”\n\nThe move comes about seven months after New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte rejected a request for a sentence reduction hearing. Ayotte said she reviewed the case and decided it was not deserving of a hearing.\n\nA spokesman for the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision said it would have no comment about the petition.\n\nA spokeman for New Hampshire’s attorney general said it would not comment on pending litigation “other than to note that the State maintains Ms. Smart received a fair trial and that her convictions were lawfully obtained and upheld on appeal.”\n\nIn their petition, lawyers for the 57-year-old Smart argue that prosecutors misled the jury by providing them with inaccurate transcripts of surreptitiously recorded conversations of Ms. Smart that included words that were not audible on the recordings. Among the words they claim weren't audible but in the transcript were the word killed in the sentence “you had your husband killed,\" the word busted in the sentence “I'm gonna be busted\" and the word murder in the sentence “this would have been the perfect murder.”\n\n“Modern science confirms what common sense has always told us: when people are handed a script, they inevitably hear the words they are shown,” Smart’s attorney, Matthew Zernhelt, said in a statement. “Jurors were not evaluating the recordings independently — they were being directed toward a conclusion, and that direction decided the verdict.”\n\nLawyers also argued the conviction should be overturned because the verdict was tainted by the media attention and due to faulty instructions to the jury. They argued jurors were told they must find that Smart acted with premeditation, not told they must consider only evidence presented at trial.\n\nThey also argued the trial court gave her a mandatory life sentence without parole for being an accomplice to first-degree murder, despite New Hampshire not mandating that sentence for the charge.\n\nSmart was a 22-year-old high school media coordinator when she began an affair with a 15-year-old boy who later fatally shot her husband, Gregory Smart, in Derry. The shooter was freed in 2015 after serving a 25-year sentence. Although Smart denied knowledge of the plot, she was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and other crimes and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nIt took until 2024 for Smart to take full responsibility for her husband’s death. In a video released in June, she said she spent years deflecting blame “almost as if it was a coping mechanism.”\n\nSmart’s trial was a media circus and one of America’s first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school employee and a student. The student, William Flynn, testified that Smart told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything if they divorced and that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. Flynn and three other teens cooperated with prosecutors and all have since been released.\n\nFlynn and 17-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts’ Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man’s throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. Both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and were sentenced to 28 years to life. They were granted parole in 2015. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released.\n\nThe case inspired Joyce Maynard’s 1992 book “To Die For” and the 1995 film of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix.",

He has also spoken up when he believes lawyers are not ⁠best serving their clients.\n\nIn a 2013 law review article, ‌he wrote that some lawyers were \"outraged\" and accused him of \"arrogation of power\" when he rejected a $675 million settlement negotiated between New York City and injured first responders who raced to the World Trade Center after the attacks of ‍September 11, 2001.\n\nHellerstein concluded that, while no statute or rule clearly addressed whether the deal needed his blessing, he had inherent authority to reject it as inadequate.\n\nThe attorneys ended up presenting Hellerstein with a new settlement that added $125 million for victims.\n\nHellerstein \"is a man of strongly held convictions and he seeks to find a way to harmonize ​the law with his understanding of justice,\" said Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who has observed Hellerstein on the bench.\n\nHellerstein has spoken ‌candidly about how his Jewish values affect his decision-making.\n\n\"As a judge, and as a Jew, I consider that everything I do reflects God and affects His image,\" he wrote in the 2013 article.\n\nIn the 2020 podcast, Hellerstein said he believes he was \"the first Orthodox boy employed by a gentile or Jewish firm in New York City.\"\n\n\"I'm pleased to say that after me there were others, and some credited me with having broken the precedent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nHellerstein already had a long career before President Bill Clinton nominated him to the federal bench in 1998.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1960, Hellerstein served in the ⁠Judge Advocate General's Corps, the legal arm of the United States Army.\n\nIn 1960, Hellerstein ​joined the now-defunct firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, where he ended up practicing for much ​of his career.\n\nA HISTORY OF REBUKING TRUMP'S LEGAL GAMBITS\n\nIn a high-profile case in 2020, Hellerstein ordered the release of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen, after Trump's Justice Department tried to revoke his home confinement and return him to jail.\n\nHellerstein ‍concluded Trump's administration was retaliating against Cohen ⁠for writing a book.\n\nIn 2023, Hellerstein denied a request by Trump to move to federal court his New York criminal case relating to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was tried in state court and found guilty of 34 felony ⁠counts.\n\nIn May 2025, Hellerstein rejected an effort by the Trump administration to use a wartime law to send alleged gang members to Venezuela, saying the men had been improperly denied ‌their day in court.\n\n“This is the United States of America,\" he said. \"People are being thrown out of the country because of ‌their tattoos.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nA potential New York bidding war could be forming around Kyle Tucker, and if the market goes that way, the New York Yankees and New York Mets could find themselves battling it out.\n\nEarly predictions had Tucker in the $400 million range, but as the offseason has unfolded, that no longer feels safe to say, and that matters for two teams that are always willing to spend some money when it matters most.\n\nTucker is still viewed as one of the best players in baseball. He impacts the game on both sides of the baseball, can really swing it, and fits most lineups.\n\nFor the Yankees, he’d provide another middle-of-the-order presence with Aaron Judge. For the Mets, he’d represent another franchise bat to pair with Juan Soto.\n\nBoth New York teams have shown a willingness to spend, and both could use a player of his caliber after disappointing years a season ago.\n\nAccording to Jon Heyman, both squads have checked in on the left-handed hitting slugger.\n\n“Though he might not reach the early $400M predictions after his typically excellent but ultimately unsatisfying platform season with the Cubs, the all-around star (he, Mookie Betts, Aaron Judge, Juan Soto and José Ramírez are the only players to post a 4 WAR the past five seasons) should still be worth $300M-plus based on past deals and comps. But if he doesn’t mind resetting, the Dodgers could become an option for a short term and high AAV. The Yankees and Mets (and all big-market teams) have checked in, but Cody Bellinger’s versatility and lower price tag make him the New York mark — at least for now,” he wrote.\n\nIf Tucker’s asking price continues to come down, don’t be surprised if New York City turns into the center of his free-agency race.\n\nKyle Tucker now viewed as ‘fallback option’ for Yankees amid Cody Bellinger rumors\n\nAmid Jazz Chisholm rumors, Yankees predicted to sign Blue Jays’ Bo Bichette to $180 million contract\n\nRed Sox have shown interest in an All-Star the Yankees have been linked to in trade talks\n\nMariners reportedly willing to move top prospects for Yankees trade target, possibly take New York out of contention\n\nCubs predicted to make a deal for former Yankees dud and Blue Jays infielder who ruined World Series\n\nEx-Yankees fan favorite and top prospect linked to American League contender after hitting .318 last season",

    "description": "Former Arizona Cardinals head coach will apparently get a look from New York.",
    "fullText": "Kliff Kingsbury is leaving his job as Washington Commanders offensive coordinator to “pursue other opportunities.” One of those opportunities is likely to be with the New York Giants, where Kingsbury is expected to interview for the team’s vacant head-coaching position.\n\nKingsbury was offensive coordinator with Washington the past two seasons. His parting with the Commanders was described as a mutual decision between Kingsbury and Washington head coach Dan Quinn.\n\nKingsbury was praised for his work with the Commanders during Jayden Daniels’ 2024 rookie season as Washington went to the playoffs and had one of the league’s better offenses. With Daniels suffering through an injury-plagued 2025, the Commanders won just five games and Kingsbury’s offense was not nearly as prolific.\n\nDaniels and other Commanders players are apparently not happy with Kingsbury’s exit.\n\nKingsbury was head coach of the Arizona Cardinals for four seasons, from 2019-2022. He compiled a 28-37-1 (.432 winning percentage). His best season was 2021, when the Cardinals went 11-6 and lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams.\n\nPrior to Arizona, Kingsbury went 35-40 (.467) in six seasons as head coach at Texas Tech.\n\nI discussed Kingsbury with David Harrison, Commanders insider for Locked on Commanders, recently. Harrison said he would “lean to the side of no,” when I asked him if he thought Kingsbury should be in the conversation for the Giants.\n\n“I think that to be fair, like I don’t get to see, and you know this obviously, but to those who don’t, I don’t get to see Cliff do his day-to-day job and and all those things and full interaction with the players. So there there’s got to be a big grain of salt taken with I think any media member’s opinion on whether or not a guy would be a good head coach,” Harrison said. “But just looking at some of the things I can look at, Cliff still seems to be a guy who is very much kind of stuck in his way.\n\n“Kliff Kingsbury at the end of the day when he feels the he has the excuse, when he feels he has the reason, he’s going to revert back to what he wants to do. It’s not really about what is best for my team. It’s not and and don’t me wrong, like he thinks it’s best for his team, right? I should I should definitely put that in there. It’s not like he’s saying, “I don’t care that that’s what’s best. I want to do what I want to do.” Like, he thinks it’s best for his team. But what he doesn’t have is the situational awareness to understand that like, ‘No, it’s not’.\n\n“… until the head man says, “Hey dude, this is what we’re going to do.” He’s not going to see it himself. And if I’m hiring a head coach, I need a guy that can see the picture for what it is, not see the confirmation bias, that he wants to tell himself that he’s right all the time. And I just don’t think that Cliff is there.”",

    "fullText": "A new study has bolstered a scathing dissent from liberal Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that warned the court appeared to favor the rich.\n\nThe study, published Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research, investigated whether the Supreme Court has contributed to rising income inequality by ruling in favor of policies that favor wealthy parties.\n\nIts authors—two academics from Columbia University in New York and one from Yale University—found that in cases pitting the rich against the poor, Republican appointees were far more likely than their Democratic colleagues to side with the wealthier party.\n\nBack in 1953, Democratic and Republican appointees were statistically indistinguishable on the issue, with justices appointed by members of both parties favoring the rich in 45 percent of cases on average.\n\nThe average Democratic justice cast a “pro-rich” vote—which was defined as a vote that would directly shift resources to the party that was more likely to be wealthy, including votes that supported businesses over consumers or workers—just 35 percent of the time.\n\n“The results reveal a steady increase in polarization, mostly due to Republican appointees whose decisions rise from about 50 percent pro-rich share to a 70 percent pro-rich share over the course of 70 years,” the study’s authors, Andrea Prat, a Columbia economics professor, Jacob Spitz, a Columbia PhD student, Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, and wrote.\n\nThe findings also supported a June dissent authored by Brown Jackson, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe justices held 7-2 that oil and gas companies had legal standing to challenge California’s environmental regulations requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered ones.\n\n“This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens,” Brown Jackson wrote. “I worry that the fuel industry’s gain comes at a reputational cost for this Court, which is already viewed by many as being overly sympathetic to corporate interests.”\n\nThat perception could be contributing to an overall drop in public confidence in the court, according to the Times. The Daily Beast has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.\n\nThe court’s favorability rating has plunged by 22 points over the past five years, from 70 percent in 2020 to a near-record low 48 percent late last year, the Pew Research Center reported in September.\n\nAnd although a vast majority of Americans, or 86 percent, think the justices should be non-partisan, 56 percent said the justices were doing only a fair or poor job of keeping their political views out of their legal decision-making.",

    "description": "The New York Rangers’ 3-2 loss to the Utah Mammoth was overshadowed by Igor Shetserkin’s injury scare.",
    "fullText": "The New York Rangers’ 3-2 loss to the Utah Mammoth was overshadowed by Igor Shetserkin’s injury scare.\n\nIn the first period, with JJ Peterka driving to the net, Shesterkin’s leg seemed to get caught in an awkward position.\n\nAfter lying on the ice in agony for over a minute, Shesterkin made his way to the locker room with the help of a trainer, unable to put any weight on his leg.\n\nMike Sullivan confirmed that Shesterkin is being evaluated for a lower-body injury, but he did not delve into much detail regarding his long-term status.\n\n“I mean, obviously we don't want him to get hurt,” Sullivan said. “He's an important part of this team, and hopefully it's not too serious. I don't have an answer for you because obviously they're gonna do more more testament right now he's being evaluated.”\n\nWhile it’s never safe to assume anything, Shesterkin’s injury certainly did look concerning, and if he is indeed slated to miss a long period of time, the Rangers are in a heap of trouble.\n\nShesterkin serves as the Rangers’ engine, and his loss for any period of time is extremely problematic for the Blueshirts.\n\n“There are certain guys that drive your team. He's one of them for us,” Sullivan said of Shesterkin. “He's an elite player at his position. I think he's one of the very best in the game. When you lose a player like that for any length of time, those types of players are difficult to replace.”\n\nJonathan Quick ultimately filled in for the injured Shesterkin and recorded 14 saves on 17 shots. He set the tone, making some crucial stops while also showing a level of passion, specifically when Daniil But bumped into him, and decided to go after him.\n\nIf Shesterkin is to miss time, the Rangers will be forced to rely on the 39-year-old Quick.\n\n“He's a fierce competitor. He's still an excellent goalie,” Sullivan said of Quick. “He's one of the leaders in that room, for good reason. His body of work speaks for itself. If you ask my opinion, I think he's a first ballot Hall of Famer with what he's accomplished in the game. He loves the game, and he loves to compete, and he's very capable.”\n\nThe game, in which the Rangers were unable to hold onto a one-goal lead in the third period, en route to an overtime loss, feels meaningless due to what could possibly be at stake with Shesterkin’s injury and the ripple effect it would have on the rest of the team.\n\nAs it stands right now, the Rangers are three points out of a wild-card spot with three games in hand as it will be a dog fight to make the playoffs.\n\nIgor Shesterkin Exits Game Against Mammoth After Suffering Scary-Looking Injury In the first period of the New York <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/new-york-rangers\">Rangers</a>’ Monday night game against the Utah Mammoth, Igor Shesterkin suffered a scary-looking lower-body injury.&nbsp;\n\nThe direction Blueshirts’ general manager Chris Drury will go at the trade deadline would drastically change if Shesterkin’s injury were to be serious.\n\nWhen talking on WFAN Radio, Rangers owner James Dolan gave a vote of confidence to Drury, preaching patience as the team tries to build a culture under Sullivan, essentially ensuring Drury is not on the hot seat despite the team’s disastrous 2024-25 campaign and inconsistencies through the first half of this season.\n\nStaying a float in the Eastern Conference is a difficult task without Shesterkin.\n\nIf Shesterkin is out for a long period of time, Drury may be forced to take a selling approach at the trade deadline, directly impacting Artemi Panarin, who is set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer and is still without a long-term contract extension past the 2025-26 season.\n\nThere’s a lot that hinders on Shesterkin, and the severity of his injury will in all likelihood be revealed within the next couple of days.",

    "fullText": "Knicks owner crushes dreams of fans hoping for Giannis Antetokounmpo trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNew York Knicks fans hoping that the team will trade for disgruntled Milwaukee Bucks star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo will be disappointed by recent comments from Knicks owner James Dolan.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on The Carton Show, Dolan said that the organization is very happy with the roster as currently constructed and doesn’t see any major moves on the horizon.\n\n“We love our team right now. They have chemistry. They all like each other,” Dolan said. “I’ve never seen a locker room more copacetic. There’s a lot of energy in there. Leon [Rose] can always overrule me, but I don’t see us making a big change. This group can win a championship. I believe that.”\n\nLast year, the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2000, and they're looking to improve upon that finish this season. Dolan seems to believe that health and continuity is what the Knicks need to take the next step, not a major shakeup.\n\n“Look how far we got with our group last year,” Dolan said. “Then take a look at who was playing and who wasn’t. We had injuries. Now we’re going into the second half of the season with more depth. If we stay healthy, we’ll go into the playoffs in much better condition.”\n\nThe trade deadline is about a month away, and New York has been frequently mentioned as a potential landing spot for Antetokounmpo. But, if Dolan is to be taken at his word, that won’t be happening any time soon.\n\nPerhaps if the Knicks have an early exit from the postseason, Dolan could change his stance regarding the roster over the offseason. But for now, Knicks fans shouldn’t hold their breath for an Antetokounmpo trade.\n\nNew York Knicks owner shares harsh criticism of Tom Thibodeau\n\nJames Dolan explains why Knicks won't hang NBA Cup banner",

    "description": "After President Donald Trump stunned the world by saying the US plans to “run” Venezuela, uncertainty over what that means and who is in charge loomed over the South American nation.  Ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was an indicted prisoner on a flight bound for New York by the time his Vice President Delcy Rodríguez — who Trump said would partner with Washington to “make Venezuela great again” — denounced the intervention as “barbaric” and a “kidnapping.” Adding to the confusion was that the White House offered few details about what running an oil-producing nation of about 30 million people would entail. Bloomberg News National Security Team Leader Nick Wadhams joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss.

    "description": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had a lot to say during his first Manhattan federal court appearance.",
    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro defiantly proclaimed his innocence in a Manhattan federal court Monday morning during his and his wife's first public appearance since US forces captured them in a dramatic military raid on Caracas over the weekend.\n\n\"I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country,\" Maduro told the judge through an interpreter when asked for his plea on narco-terrorism and weapons charges.\n\nHe was then interrupted by the judge, who interjected, \"A not guilty plea will be entered on behalf of Mr. Maduro.\"\n\nIt was one of several dramatic moments during the roughly 30-minute hearing, which Maduro used to protest his capture by US forces.\n\nWhen he entered the courtroom, flanked by US marshals, he wished everyone a \"Happy New Year\" in English and locked eyes with members of the press sitting in the back of the courtroom.\n\nLater, as the hearing wrapped up, a person sitting in the fourth row of the courtroom gallery stood to say Maduro would pay in the name of the Venezuelan people.\n\n\"I am a man of God, and I am a war prisoner,\" Maduro responded in Spanish as US marshals escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were arraigned on an indictment alleging a conspiracy to import cocaine and a related conspiracy to possess machine guns and other \"destructive devices\" in furtherance of drug trafficking. Maduro also faces a narco-terrorism conspiracy charge.\n\nThe two wore standard-issue jail garb of navy smocks over orange long-sleeve shirts with khaki pants. At their seats in the courtroom, they wore headphones to listen to their court-appointed translators.\n\nWhen he stood to address the judge, Maduro held on to the arms of his chair as he rose unsteadily. Flores, her blonde hair tied back in a bun, had several small bandages on her face. She sustained injuries during her \"abduction\" in Caracas, one of her attorneys said.\n\nDuring the packed noon hearing, US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein read the couple a summary of their charges and informed the Venezuelan president and first lady of their rights before the pair entered not guilty pleas. He addressed them as \"Mr. Maduro\" and \"Ms. Flores.\"\n\nWhen asked to confirm his identity at the start of the hearing, Maduro began by stating in firmly spoken Spanish that he is \"Presidente constitutional de la Republica Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I am here, kidnapped, since January 3, Saturday,\" Maduro said. I was captured in my home in Caracas, Venezuela.\"\n\n\"There will be a time and place to go into all this,\" the judge interrupted.\n\nAsked for her plea, Flores spoke in a quiet, hoarse voice.\n\n\"Not guilty. Completely innocent,\" she said through a court interpreter.\n\nBoth Maduro and Flores are facing health issues and will need medical attention while awaiting trial, their lawyers said.\n\n\"Miss Flores, during her abduction, sustained significant injuries, as you can see today here in court,\" defense lawyer Mark Donnelly told the judge. \"There's a belief that she may have a fracture or severe bruising on her ribs,\" the lawyer added.\n\nThe 25-page indictment filed against Maduro, his wife, son, and three others alleges that for over 25 years, Venezuelan leaders \"have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.\"\n\nMaduro was represented in court by Barry Pollack, an attorney best known for also representing WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange. Flores was represented by the Texas-based attorney Mark Donnelly and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.\n\nThe attorneys said they would not seek bail for Maduro or Flores on Monday, but reserved the right to seek it at a later date. Pollack told Hellerstein he anticipated \"voluminous and complicated legal practice.\"\n\n\"Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,\" Pollack said. \"He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.\"\n\nHellerstein scheduled the next court hearing for March 17.\n\nMaduro has long been a target of the US Justice Department. Manhattan federal prosecutors first indicted him in 2020, accusing him of heading the drug-trafficking network, the Cartel de los Soles.\n\nIn 2015, the nephews of Maduro's wife, Flores, were arrested in Haiti and charged with drug trafficking by the same office handling the Maduro case.\n\nThe indictment says Maduro is \"at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.\"\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump said the US captured the Venezuelan president following large-scale strikes on the South American nation.\n\nTrump said the US will \"run\" Venezuela until a \"safe, proper, and judicious transition\" can be facilitated. It remains unclear how the Trump administration would carry out this plan and for how long.",

    "fullText": "What could have been for the New York Giants in Week 18...\n\nAfter losing control of the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL draft following a Week 17 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, the Giants still had an opportunity to secure the top spot this past Sunday -- with some help.\n\nA loss to the Dallas Cowboys and an unlikely Raiders win (with a few other dominoes that ultimately fell into place), the Giants would have picked first overall in April. And as fate would have it, the stars aligned with a single exception: Big Blue themselves.\n\nThe Giants came out on fire and dismantled the Dallas Cowboys, 34-17, ending any hope of securing No. 1 overall before the Raiders even played. And perhaps that's why the outcomes of the afternoon slate of games sting a bit.\n\nUltimately, the Raiders did their part. They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, 14-12, and did so in a way that is ironic for the Giants.\n\nSince 2014, 21% of all 60-plus-yard field goals have come against the Giants. All 21% have come late in the fourth quarter or in overtime. So it's only fitting that Las Vegas picked up their victory with a 60-yard field goal -- a career-long for kicker Daniel Carlson.\n\nWowza. #Raiders K Daniel Carlson just drilled a 60-yard FG for the win.\n\nRaiders will still have the No. 1 overall pick. The Chiefs draft position will also improve.pic.twitter.com/cQKPA1Wf0V\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) January 5, 2026\n\nUnderstandably, Giants fans reacted with frustration as the kick sailed through the uprights.\n\nIn the end, the kick and the Raiders' victory meant nothing for the Giants because the \"damage\" had already been done. Still, for Giants Nation, being on the positive end of a 60-yard field goal would have been a nice change of pace.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Another 60-plus-yard field goal taunts New York Giants fans",

    "description": "The Giants wrap up their 2025 season Sunday.",
    "fullText": "The Giants finish yet another miserable season Sunday, when they host the Cowboys.\n\nSo which Giants players — including injured guys who won’t play Sunday — will not return to the team in 2026?\n\nLet’s take a look at the players who definitely will be gone and those who are on the fence, as general manager Joe Schoen (who has overseen so much losing) is somehow trending toward returning.\n\nCUT CANDIDATES WHO LIKELY WON’T RETURN\n\nRB Devin Singletary, K Graham Gano, OT James Hudson, WR Jalin Hyatt\n\nAnalysis: The Giants have their young running back duo for 2026 (Cam Skattebo and Tyrone Tracy). They’d free up $5.25 million in salary cap space by cutting Singletary. Gano is a no-brainer cut ($4.5 million savings). Ditto for Hudson ($5.5 million savings).\n\nHyatt can’t even get on the field. A brutal third-round pick by Schoen. His cap number for 2026 isn’t crazy ($1.7 million), but the Giants would free up $1.5 million of that by releasing him. Why bother retaining him?\n\nMLB Bobby Okereke, LG Jon Runyan\n\nAnalysis: The main issue here is that the Giants would need to find quality replacement starters. The four guys in that first group are much more expendable. But releasing Okereke and Runyan is tempting if only because of the cap savings — $9 million and $9.25 million, respectively.\n\nPENDING FREE AGENTS WHO LIKELY WON’T RETURN\n\nQB Russell Wilson, OL Evan Neal, DT Rakeem Nunez-Roches, RG Greg Van Roten, OL Josh Ezeudu\n\nAnalysis: The Wilson signing failed spectacularly. (Expect him to retire.) Ditto for Schoen drafting Neal (seventh overall) and Ezeudu (third round) in 2022. Two more wasted picks. Nunez-Roches, who turns 33 in July, can no longer stop the run. Van Roten is solid but not spectacular ­— and about to turn 36. The Giants need a younger right guard.\n\nPENDING FREE AGENTS ON THE FENCE\n\nRT Jermaine Eluemunor, WR Wan’Dale Robinson, TE Chris Manhertz, LS Casey Kreiter, CB Cor’Dale Flott, WR Gunner Olszewski, TE Daniel Bellinger, S Dane Belton, ILB Micah McFadden, DT D.J. Davidson\n\nAnalysis: Robinson and Flott are the Giants’ top in-house free agents, and Schoen should work hard to re-sign both. Robinson gives the Giants a slippery presence in the slot, while Flott blossomed into a very good outside corner in 2025. Both would be significant losses if they depart.\n\nEluemunor is a bit trickier, since he is 31. But he pass-blocked well while playing on a two-year contract from 2024-25. You could make a legit case for bringing him back with a short-term commitment.\n\nThe other guys here are lower-profile players.\n\nBellinger lost his starting job to Theo Johnson in 2024, so he probably doesn’t even want to come back. Manhertz is a solid veteran presence. He is worth keeping as a backup, especially since he won’t be expensive. Kreiter will provide special teams consistency with Gano out the door.\n\nOlszewski is an OK returner, but not great. Belton has turned into a strong special teams player, though he isn’t starter material on defense. The Giants could easily move on from Davidson, who is inconsistent. McFadden was trending upward, but he got hurt in Week 1 and missed the season.\n\nCowboys vs. Giants free live stream: How to watch NFL game online (1/4/26)\n\nWhere to watch Cowboys vs. Giants free live stream today (1/4/26) without Streameast\n\nHow to watch NFL RedZone online without cable for Week 18 (1/4/26) | Free trials, live stream, cost\n\nGiants-Cowboys weather: Ice, wind and injuries loom over showdown at MetLife Stadium",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees have not made any major moves this offseason, whether it's a trade or a free agent deal.\n\nBut the offseason can move quickly, and a new rumor is drawing up some hype for the Yankees in their next potential move this winter.\n\nAccording to Ken Rosenthal and Chris Kirschner of The Athletic, the Yankees are reportedly in trade talks with the Miami Marlins over a 6'5'' right-hander who would be an incredible pickup for New York.\n\n\"With uncertainty around their starting rotation to begin the season,\" The Athletic duo report, \"the New York Yankees are talking to the Miami Marlins about a potential trade for starting pitcher Edward Cabrera, league sources told The Athletic.\"\n\nEdward Cabrera is an interesting right-handed starter who is 27 years old and under control through the 2028 MLB season.\n\nThis report from Rosenthal and Kirschner is a big one, as the Yankees, for the first time in a while, are seemingly making progress towards a big offseason move.\n\nAfter not showing interest in retaining Devin Williams and Luke Weaver, and plenty of other op names sign with new teams this offseason, there was concern about what the Yankees would do this winter.\n\nMore: Yankees officially announce signing of veteran infielder\n\nFortunately, this update from The Athletic is a bit of good news, as Cabrera, a right-handed starter, would be an incredible pickup if the Yankees can make a deal work.\n\nHe's coming off a strong 2025 campaign, where he had a 3.53 ERA in 26 starts with 2.8 bWAR, and 150 strikeouts in 137.2 innings pitched.\n\nWhile he's not pitched a full 32-game season, and has dealt with some injuries and inconsistencies in his big-league career, the promise he's shown is more than worth investing in.\n\nCabrera is one of the top starters who could be dealt this offseason, and if the Yankees, now in talks with the Marlins, can make this deal work, it would be a huge coup for New York after a lackluster offseason to this point.\n\nYankees' Cody Bellinger free agent rumor is bad news for potential re-signing\n\nYankees' young slugger named potential 'breakout candidate' for 2026\n\nYankees could pursue Nationals' 'ace potential' All-Star\n\nAngels sign ex-Yankees, Braves, Padres reliever to one-year deal\n\nEx-Yankees fan favorite and top prospect linked to American League contender after hitting .318 last season",

Whether you're pessimistic or optimistic, it's definitely not the good kind of history either.\n\nThe Jets will play the Bills at 4:25 P.M. today, and if they do not get an interception against Josh Allen, they will have gone through the entire season without getting a pick against an opposing quarterback. Making them the first team in NFL history to do so.\n\nThe projected starters this week do not necessarily have a history of turning the ball over, as the starters against the Bills have accounted for only 11 turnovers across their careers. Interceptions have been a bit of a foreign concept for the New York Jets for several years, but to go an entire season without having an interception is definitely something worth noting.\n\nThis offseason, the Jets will not focus solely on defense. Still, the franchise is aware of the shortcomings in competing in the NFL: being physical, playing fast, and forcing turnovers will be a priority in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: New York Jets are on the brink of history, and not the good kind",

    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores are reportedly awaiting their first court appearance at a Brooklyn jail famous for its poor conditions.\n\nNumerous publications, including The Wall Street Journal, have reported that the pair were escorted to the Metropolitan Detention Center late Saturday after arriving by plane in New York.\n\nMDC, which has yet to confirm the transfer to Business Insider, has been home to numerous high-profile defendants facing trial in New York City, including music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of fallen bitcoin exchange FTX, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of aiding the sex trafficking operation of the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nLuigi Mangioni has been housed at MDC while awaiting trial for the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe jail has been widely criticized over the years for its poor conditions, having been described as \"inhumane\" and \"hell on earth.\"\n\nLast year, the Legal Aid Society issued a press release lamenting the jail's \"documented history of violence, medical neglect, and human and civil rights violations.\" It cited reports of no heat during the winter and \"maggot-infested food.\"\n\nIn 2024, a federal judge in Brooklyn made headlines when he carved out a special exemption during sentencing to help a defendant avoid the MDC. The judge ruled that if the 74-year-old, convicted of tax fraud, were assigned to the MDC, he could serve his time under house arrest, The New York Times reported.\n\nIn March, Brooklyn federal prosecutors announced charges against 25 defendants in 12 separate cases tied to violence and contraband smuggling at the jail, which is located in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn.\n\n\"Over the years, MDC has become synonymous with egregious neglect and abuse with the people incarcerated,\" the Legal Aid Society said in a June press release opposing ICE detentions at the jail.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shocked the world on Saturday when he announced that the US had captured the Venezuelan president and his wife after a \"large-scale strike\" on Venezuela.\n\nTrump has said the US is \"going to run the country\" until it can facilitate a safe transition of power, and that US oil companies will now be free to \"spend billions\" on development in the South American nation.\n\nMaduro has been in the US Department of Justice's crosshairs for years, and in 2020, Manhattan federal prosecutors indicted him as a leader of the Cartel de Las Soles, its name for the alleged drug-trafficking organization run by Venezuela's military and political elite.\n\nAn expanded indictment unsealed on Saturday added as defendants Maduro's wife and son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra, identified in the indictment as \"The Prince.\" It accused them of participating in a wide-ranging effort to traffic drugs to the US to enrich themselves.",

    "fullText": "Less than 24 hours after throngs of ecstatic supporters poured into Manhattan for his history-making inauguration, Zohran Mamdani began his first full day of work with a routine familiar to many New Yorkers: trudging to the subway from a cramped apartment.\n\nBundled against the frigid temperature and seemingly fighting off a cold, he set out Friday morning from the one-bedroom apartment in Queens that he shares with his wife. But unlike most commuters, Mamdani’s trip was documented by a photo and video crew, and periodically interrupted by neighbors wishing him luck.\n\nThe 34-year-old democratic socialist, whose victory was hailed as a watershed moment for the progressive movement, has now begun the task of running the nation’s largest city: signing orders, announcing appointments, facing questions from the press — and answering for some of the actions he took in his first hours.\n\nBut first, the symbolism-laden day one commute.\n\nFlanked by security guards and a small clutch of aides on a Manhattan-bound train, he agreed to several selfies with wide-eyed riders, then moved to a corner seat of the train to review his briefing materials.\n\nWhen a pair of French tourists, confused by the hubbub, approached Mamdani, he introduced himself as “the new mayor of New York.” They seemed doubtful. He held up the morning’s copy of the New York Daily News, featuring his smiling face, as proof.\n\nMamdani, a Democrat, is hardly alone among city mayors in using the transit system to communicate relatability. His predecessor, Eric Adams, also rode the subway on his first day, and both Bill de Blasio and Michael Bloomberg made a habit out of it, particularly when seeking to make a political point.\n\nWithin minutes of Mamdani entering City Hall, the images of him riding public transit had lit up social media.\n\nIf the ride served as a well-timed photo-op, it also seemed to reflect Mamdani’s pledge, made in his inaugural speech, to ensure his “government looks and lives like the people it represents.”\n\nHis other early actions have also seemed to underscore that priority.\n\nAfter centering much of his campaign on making rent cheaper for New Yorkers, Mamdani raced from his inauguration ceremony Thursday to a Brooklyn apartment building lobby, drawing boisterous cheers from the tenants union as he pledged that the city would ramp up an ongoing legal fight against the allegedly negligent landlord.\n\nMamdani’s next action, meanwhile, showed the unusual scrutiny faced by his nascent administration, particularly around his criticism of Israel and outspoken support for the Palestinian cause.\n\nIn an effort to give his government a “clean slate,” he revoked a slate of executive orders issued by Adams late in his term, including two related to Israel: one that officially adopted a contentious definition of antisemitism that includes certain criticism of Israel, and another barring city agencies and employees from boycotting or divesting from the country.\n\nThe move drew swift backlash from some Jewish groups, including allegations from the Israeli government posted to social media that Mamdani had poured “antisemitic gasoline on an open fire.”\n\nWhen a journalist on Friday asked about the revoked orders, Mamdani read from prepared remarks, promising his administration would be “relentless in its effort to combat hate and division.” He noted that he had left in place the Mayor’s Office to Combat Antisemitism.\n\nMamdani also announced the creation of a “mass engagement” office, which he said would continue the work his campaign’s field operation did to bring more New Yorkers into the political fold.\n\nRinged by supporters and passersby who stood several rows deep, phones in the air, to catch a glimpse of the new mayor, Mamdani then acknowledged the weight of the current moment.\n\n“We have an opportunity where New Yorkers are allowing themselves to believe in the possibility of city government once again,” he said. “That is not a belief that will sustain itself in the absence of action.”\n\nAlso on Mamdani’s to-do list: Moving to the mayor’s official residence, a stately mansion in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, before the lease on his Queens apartment ends later this month.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Identifying three potential X-factors for the New York Jets defense against the Buffalo Bills in Week 18.",
    "fullText": "The New York Jets will play their Week 18 finale versus the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\nIt'll represent the last showing for a defense that must undergo a serious identity makeover in the offseason. Head coach Aaron Glenn will hire a new defensive coordinator. General manager Darren Mougey will also be tasked with acquiring more talented playmakers on defense. They are heavily outmatched heading into Sunday.\n\nUntil then, we've identified three potential X-factors for the Jets defense in Week 18.\n\nJermaine Johnson II hasn't recorded a sack in his latest six appearances. It's been tough sledding for the pass rusher who returned from a 2024 season-ending torn Achilles injury. Johnson continues playing with effort, so it would be nice to see him finish the season with a breakthrough.\n\nInterim defensive coordinator Chris Harris recently heaped praise on linebacker Jamien Sherwood. Sherwood leads the Jets in tackles by a longshot with 147 takedowns this season. Despite it being a lost season, he continues to compete to his full capabilities.\n\nVeteran defensive tackle Harrison Phillips has been a limited participant at practice this week. That indicates he's trending towards being available for Sunday's finale. The Jets need Phillips' run-stopping efforts against Josh Allen and James Cook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: New York Jets vs. Buffalo Bills: 3 X-factors on defense for Week 18",

    "description": "With a playoff berth already guaranteed, the Buffalo Bills are playing for health and seeding this weekend.",
    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills are headed to the playoffs, extending their franchise-record streak to seven consecutive seasons. The New York Jets, on the other hand, are going to miss the playoffs for the 15th straight season. I won’t kick them while they’re down — we know better than any fan base what it feels like to miss the playoffs for an absurd amount of years — but it’s wild to think that the Jets have been as bad as they’ve been for as long as they have been.\n\nSunday’s game not only brings the regular season to a close, but it also brings Highmark Stadium’s tenure as home of the Buffalo Bills to an end, as well. Barring something strange where the Bills host the AFC Championship Game, Sunday’s contest will be the final game played in the stadium before the Bills open their brand new facility in September. Fittingly, it’s the Jets coming in on Sunday to close the stadium, as the Jets were also the first opponent for a regular-season game in the stadium way back in 1973.\n\nThat game was a real barn-burner, as the Bills beat the Jets by a final score of 9-7. John Leypoldt hit three field goals, O.J. Simpson rushed for 124 yards, and the Buffalo defense withstood an Al Woodall 36-yard touchdown pass to Jerome Barkum in the fourth quarter to hold on for a win. While we’d hope the game on Sunday will feature more excitement than the first meeting in this building between these two teams, it’s possible that the game takes on the form of a preseason game given its lack of meaning in the standings for both clubs.\n\nBuffalo cannot win the AFC East, so they’ll either be the five, six, or seven seed depending on Sunday’s slate of results. The Jets, meanwhile, win by losing, as they can clinch the No. 2 overall pick with a loss and a New York Giants win. They could also drop out of the top three choices with a win and losses from some other eliminated franchises.\n\nHow do we pick players to watch for a game where we’re not even sure who’s going to play? Well, we make it up as we go along. Our five Bills to watch this week are below, but feel free to share yours in the comments.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nYes, I heard head coach Sean McDermott when he said that this week would be “business as usual” with the starters. I also heard when he said that quarterback Josh Allen is “in a better place” with his foot injury this week than he was last week. I’ve also seen Allen log “DNPs” at practice on both Wednesday and Thursday, and then a limited session on Friday. Allen is going to start the game. He might even play a drive or two as the team tries to ensure that he scores 40 total touchdowns for a record sixth consecutive season.\n\nIt’s going to be Trubisky time at some point in the afternoon, though, so I’m watching mostly to see how quickly the clock strikes “Mitch” in this game. Individual statistics are fun, but healthy players in the playoffs are much more important. Playing Trubisky for the majority of this game is the right thing to do.\n\nSpeaking of guys who will likely play a bunch on Sunday, Buffalo’s kickoff returner extraordinaire is likely in line for plenty of carries on Sunday. Davis has just 37 rushing attempts this season, and he hasn’t had more than nine carries in a game. He’s hit that threshold three times, with the first of those times coming against these Jets in September. Davis ran nine times for 24 yards against the Jets in the first meeting.\n\nI expect that he’ll have right around that carry figure, if not more, with more yards gained and greater efficiency this time around. Would it be great for James Cook III to win the rushing title? Absolutely. Is it worth risking him turning an ankle heading into the playoffs? It absolutely is not. Davis should see the lion’s share of the snaps on Sunday.\n\nEff it. If Coleman is going to log a snap-count number greater than his jersey number at any point, this weekend is the time to do it. If I’m the Bills, I make Coleman active and force-feed him targets all day. What do they have to lose? At best, Coleman looks great, it gives him and the team confidence that he can help this postseason, and it spurs him onward to a great run in January and February.\n\nMaybe Coleman looks good enough where the team can point to this performance during the offseason as a reason for another club to trade for Coleman, just as they can point to another Class of 2024 wideout — Adonai Mitchell — across the field on Sunday as an example of the power of a change of scenery. At worst, Coleman plays and looks like a total non-factor in a game that ultimately means nothing, and the Bills have all the data they need to give up on their 2024 second-round choice.\n\nThe reward of playing Coleman in this game outweighs the risk, in my eyes. I’d let him roll and see what the kid can do.\n\nAnother deep cut! Center Conor McGovern has been dealing with injuries all season long, and he’s gutted through them admirably. At some point on Sunday, I’d love to see the Bills give McGovern a break and go to their second-year man. This serves two purposes: for starters, it gives McGovern some rest. Secondarily, it gives Van Pran-Granger some in-game experience heading into an offseason where McGovern, starting left guard David Edwards, and top interior reserve Alec Anderson are all free agents.\n\nDo the Bills think SVPG has what it takes to step into the starting lineup next season? Or will they need to commit big resources to keeping the band together up front? And, if so, which linemen do they retain? There are some big offseason questions to answer along the offensive line, but for now, resting McGovern would be a good move.\n\nMany of us have been clamoring for the rookie to see the field more this season. Well, kid, Sunday should be the day it happens. Jordan Poyer is already hurt and out for Sunday, so we’ll probably see more Darnell Savage this week. Cam Lewis started in Poyer’s place last week, but given his tremendous role on special teams and in dime packages, the team will likely limit his snaps, as well. Cole Bishop is entrenched as a starter, but it wouldn’t be the worst idea to let him play a little less this week.\n\nDo the Bills want to use Hancock as a safety? Or, will they slot him in — pun intended — for nickel corner Taron Johnson? Playing Hancock more this week would be a good move, as it would give the rookie some much-needed in-game experience while also resting some key veterans.",

    "description": "Ultrawealthy tech investors like David Sacks and Peter Thiel are weighing their options ahead of California's proposed billionaire wealth tax.",
    "fullText": "Is Miami destined to be the new Wall Street, and Austin the next Silicon Valley? \"All-in\" podcaster and White House AI czar David Sacks thinks so.\n\nSacks kicked off a New Year's social media debate by declaring that Miami will overtake New York as the nation's financial capital — and that Austin is poised to replace San Francisco as the center of tech.\n\n\"As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital,\" Sacks wrote in a January 1 post on X that ricocheted through tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from defenders of the old hubs.\n\nLinda Yaccarino, the former CEO of X, responded to Sacks with the word \"Miami\" along with a fire emoji.\n\nGarry Tan, who runs Y Combinator, the influential startup accelerator behind Airbnb, Stripe, and Dropbox, weighed in, saying the firm hasn't expanded beyond San Francisco because founders are still much more likely to build successful, product-market-fit unicorns in the region.\n\nWe haven’t done it yet because it is much more likely that people create successful PMF unicorns staying in SF Bay Area at a rate of 2.5x more\n\nNYC is about 2x\n\nTan recently said he would consider opening an Austin outpost if California moves forward with a proposed billionaire tax. The ballot measure would impose a one-time 5% levy on California residents with assets exceeding $1 billion and could go before voters in November if it qualifies.\n\nSacks urged Tan to reconsider, arguing that a Y Combinator outpost in Austin could become a \"self-fulfilling prophecy.\" \"If YC and others support Austin, it will be successful,\" Sacks said.\n\nMusk replied simply, \"Yes.\" The Pittsburgh-based venture capitalist Brandon Brooks said an Austin outpost \"would be the biggest shift for the startup ecosystem in history.\"\n\nSacks is a venture capitalist, podcaster, and one of the earliest members of the so-called \"PayPal mafia,\" a group of PayPal employees who went on to positions of influence and power in Silicon Valley. His profile surged after he was appointed the Trump administration's artificial intelligence and crypto czar.\n\nSacks' own firm is already on the move. Craft Ventures said it opened an Austin office in December, with Sacks relocating to the city while the firm maintains offices in New York and San Francisco. Fellow Texans including Elon Musk, Michael Dell, and Joe Lonsdale, one of the cofounders of Palantir, welcomed him with posts.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe argument Sacks is making isn't new (one online poster on X even replied with a popular \"Grand Theft Auto\" video game meme showing the character saying \"here we go again.\")\n\nThe debate flared during the pandemic, when remote work drove waves of coastal workers to Texas and Florida in search of more space, lower taxes, and a cheaper cost of living. Austin, in particular, ascended as companies like Tesla and Oracle moved into the region, and giants like Google and Facebook expanded their office footprints.\n\nSacks has also been making the case that high taxes, heavy regulation, and a leftward political turn are driving talent and capital out of legacy power centers like San Francisco and New York.\n\nSacks posted his prediction the same day Zohran Mamdani was inaugurated as New York City's mayor, making history as the first socialist mayor to hold the office.\n\nLonsdale's venture firm, 8VC, moved from San Francisco to Austin in 2020. Lonsdale tweeted at the time that the firm was moving for several reasons, among them: \"Austin is far more tolerant of ideological diversity than SF.\"\n\nThe hype hasn't fully held. Some tech workers told Business Insider they later left or tried to leave Austin, citing brutal heat, traffic, overcrowding, and a tech scene that felt thinner than advertised.\n\nMeanwhile, Thiel Capital is expanding in Miami as California's proposed wealth tax looms.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thiel Capital, the private investment firm founded by the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel said it has opened a new office in Miami.\n\nIf the proposal passes, the tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Good morning Gang Green Nation! The New York Jets will be on the road to face the Buffalo Bills in the last game of the regular season on Sunday. Josh Allen has not been practicing this week and is not expected to play on Sunday. For tank commanders that may cause some concern. Certainly the Jets’ chances of an upset improve with Allen out. However, the Bills still have a substantial edge at quarterback with Mitchell Trubisky under center compared to the Jets with Brady Cook under center. Unless the Bills play all their third string players and practice squad call-ups, they should still be handily favored at home. Even if that were to transpire, we should not underestimate how low this Jets team has sunk. An upset is always possible, but for now betting on the Jets to complete their tank on Sunday seems the safer bet.\n\nHere are your links to your New York Jets this glorious Friday in January:\n\nSusanna Weir – Jets-Bills Game Preview | Aiming to End 2025 Season on a High Note in Buffalo\n\nJack Bell – Jets DL Jowon Briggs: ‘You Can Be Selfish or Selfless’\n\nJohn Pullano – Stock Report 📈 | Punter Austin McNamara Looking to Finish Atop League in Key Category\n\nBrian Costello – Tanner Engstrand believes Jets offense has ‘good foundation’ in place despite brutal season\n\nNick Wojton – 2026 NFL draft: Where are the Jets’ Round 1 picks before Week 18?\n\nNick Wojton – Jets at Bills: 5 storylines to watch for during lead up to Week 18\n\nJustin Melo – 5 pending free agents who won’t return to the Jets defense in 2026\n\nNick Wojton – Jets handed poor update relating to 2026 NFL draft ahead of Week 18\n\nNick Wojton – Brady Cook named Jets’ starting QB for season finale, here’s why\n\nDharya Sharma – Jets 2026 mock draft: New York predicted to use pick from Sauce Gardner trade on SEC quarterback\n\nJustin Fried – Jets’ tank plans may have just gotten more complicated in Week 18\n\nJustin Fried – Jets’ intentions with Breece Hall are becoming clear as free agency nears\n\nJustin Fried – Every Jets player entering their final game under contract in Week 18\n\nHere are your missed connections from yesterday.",

    "fullText": "Mets get matter-of-fact update on Cody Bellinger in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCody Bellinger seems likely to spend 2026 in the Big Apple.\n\nThe New York Yankees are in the running to bring Bellinger back after a prodigious 2025 season.\n\nThe New York Mets appear the biggest threat to steal Bellinger away from the Bronx.\n\nMLB.com's Mark Feinsand reported as much in a new article on Thursday night. He sees these as the two ballclubs leading the pursuit of Bellinger.\n\n\"The Mets have been among the teams most often connected to Bellinger, and after trading Brandon Nimmo and Jeff McNeil, the need for an outfielder (or two) is clear,\" Feinsand writes. \"The two New York teams seem like the obvious fits for Bellinger, though the Angels, Blue Jays and Dodgers remain in the mix.\"\n\nMORE: Team USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nFeinsand also provided an update on the potential timeline for a Bellinger contract.\n\n\"Bellinger settled on a shorter-term deal the last time he hit the free-agent market, but with no qualifying offer attached to him as he enters his age-30 season, he’s likely to wait as long as he can until he finds the long-term deal that has evaded him,\" Feinsand wrote.\n\nThat could be a way for the Mets to differentiate themselves. If they come to the table with a longer-term deal for Bellinger, that could accelerate the wait time to getting a signature.\n\nNothing is a given. Bellinger may decide he doesn't want to leave Yankee Stadium. But if he wants to try somewhere new, Queens may hold the answer.\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nReds have a promising prospect named Ichiro Cano\n\nIt's a good day to remember Bob Feller's brilliance and his time in the U.S. Navy\n\nHow Aroldis Chapman is able to pitch for Great Britain in the WBC\n\nAlex Bregman has a key free agent preference\n\nYankees' pitcher leaving MLB to sign in Japan",

    "description": "New York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, tackles the housing crisis on day one with executive orders targeting landlords and bankruptcy case intervention.",
    "fullText": "Sworn in at midnight and again hours later publicly, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani used his first day in office Thursday to hit the ground running with new executive orders targeting city landlords and housing development. And he said the city will take what he called \"precedent-setting action\" to intervene in a private landlord bankruptcy case he said was tied to 93 buildings.\n\n\"Today is the start of a new era for New York City,\" Mamdani said. \"It is inauguration day. It is also the day that the rent is due.\"\n\nSpeaking at a Brooklyn apartment building, Mamdani framed the moves as an early test of whether city government will directly confront landlords over housing conditions and step into court cases that could determine whether tenants remain in their homes.\n\nMamdani said New Yorkers who attended his inauguration were returning to apartments where, he said, \"bad landlords do not make repairs,\" rents rise and residents deal with issues like cockroaches and a lack of heat.\n\nZohran Mamdani Will Be First Mayor To Be Sworn In On Quran During New York City Inauguration\n\nThe mayor said the new administration \"will not wait to deliver action\" and \"will stand up on behalf of the tenants of this city.\"\n\nMamdani announced three housing-related executive orders, starting with the revival of the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants, which he said will focus on resolving complaints and holding landlords accountable for hazardous conditions.\n\n\"We will make sure that 311 violations are resolved,\" Mamdani said, adding that the administration will hold \"slumlords\" accountable for \"hazardous and dangerous threats\" to tenant well-being.\n\nMamdani Taps Controversial Lawyer Who Defended Al Qaeda Terrorist For Top Role: 'Powerful Advocate'\n\nMamdani said the second executive order creates a LIFT task force, or a land-inventory effort designed to leverage city-owned land and accelerate housing development. He said the task force will review city-owned properties and identify sites suitable for housing development no later than July 1.\n\nThe third executive order creates a SPEED task force, which Mamdani said stands for Streamlining Procedures to Expedite Equitable Development. He said the task force will work to remove permitting barriers that slow housing construction.\n\nBoth task forces will be overseen by Deputy Mayor for Housing and Planning Lila Joseph, he said.\n\n\"These are sweeping measures, but it is just the beginning of a comprehensive effort to champion the cause of tenants,\" Mamdani said.\n\nFlashback: Inside The Political Movement That Put A Socialist In Charge Of New York City\n\nEarlier in the day, Mamdani signed executive order No. 1, which revoked all prior mayoral executive orders under former Mayor Eric Adams issued on or after Sept. 26, 2024, unless they were specifically reissued by Mamdani's administration.\n\nMamdani signed a second executive order setting the structure of his administration, including five deputy mayors and their oversight responsibilities.\n\nThe mayor made the announcement at 85 Clarkson Ave., a rent-stabilized building he said is owned by Pinnacle Realty, which he described as a \"notorious landlord.\"\n\nMamdani said tenants in the building have dealt with issues, including roaches and a lack of heat.\n\nMamdani said the building is one of 93 properties connect to the same landlord, and the portfolio is in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nMAMDANI PICKS EDUCATOR WHO WORKED TO DISMANTLE GIFTED & TALENTED PROGRAM AS NYC SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR\n\nThe mayor said the buildings will be auctioned to a different landlord he claimed ranks No. 6 on New York City’s worst landlord list, adding the buildings collectively have more than 5,000 open hazardous violations and 14,000 complaints.\n\n\"This is an untenable situation,\" Mamdani said. \"So, today we are announcing that we will be taking action in the bankruptcy case and stepping in to represent the interests of the city and the interests of the tenants.\"\n\nMamdani said he directed his nominee for corporation counsel, Steve Banks, to take what he called \"precedent-setting action\" in the case.\n\n\"We are a creditor and interested party,\" Mamdani said, adding that the city is owed money and will fight for \"safe and habitable homes\" while working to \"mitigate the significant risk of displacement\" that tenants face.\n\nA tenant speaker at the event described unsafe conditions in Pinnacle buildings and said a section of hardwood floor in the speaker’s mother’s apartment had remained unrepaired for seven years.\n\n\"When they filed for bankruptcy this spring, Pinnacle gambled on making our housing less affordable and our lives more miserable,\" the speaker said.\n\nThe mayor said the moves mark the start of a more aggressive use of executive power on housing issues, beginning on his first day in office.\n\nMamdani's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nOriginal article",

The mercury stood at a chilly 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14.4 degrees Celsius) at the 8 a.m. start of the parade.\n\nAcross the country, in New York City, hats and gloves were as necessary as noisemakers at the city's New Year's Eve ball drop, where temperatures near freezing appeared to be the coldest in 10 years.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people gather along the nearly six-mile (10-kilometer) route in Pasadena, where the two-hour parade kicked off. Millions more watch on national television. Organizers at the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, the group that organizes the parade ahead of the Rose Bowl college football game, said they made only small changes to accommodate the weather, such as the tops being up on convertibles carrying grand marshal Earvin “Magic” Johnson and other VIPs.\n\nRain forecasts for the Rose Parade, which had been dry for 20 years, grew all week. On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for all California counties and a coastal flood advisory through Sunday afternoon along much of the Pacific Coast near San Francisco.\n\nMeanwhile, residents in the areas hit hardest by last year's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires were under evacuation warnings.\n\nIn New York City, the sun came out ahead of Mayor Zohran Mamdani's inaugural celebration, but other areas of the Northeast and Midwest were hit by an Alberta clipper storm and trailing Arctic front that brought snow squalls and high winds.\n\nConditions varied widely — from snow showers to heavier squalls — from Wisconsin through northern Illinois and Michigan and into northern New Jersey, southeastern New York and New England.\n\nAbout a quarter of flights were delayed out of both San Diego International Airport and Boston Logan, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.",

    "fullText": "New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart closed out 2025 with unshakeable belief in a rapid turnaround, pointing to the team's talent and near-misses as proof that contention is close.\n\n\"No,\" Dart said when asked if the Giants are far from turning it around. \"I mean, we've got the pieces. This is not an excuse, but obviously, we've had a tough schedule, and we've been in really tight games where this season could completely flip. So that's kind of just the league. It's those one-score games and who can capitalize on those moments.\n\n\"We've got a lot of talent. We have some good vets, and we have a ton of young guys who are going to continue to thrive. I’ve said this a lot, we just have a ton of excitement for the future because we know what this thing can do and how we can flip this around.\"\n\nCentral to that vision is reuniting with star wide receiver Malik Nabers, sidelined for more than half the season with a torn ACL.\n\n\"We'll for sure continue to be together and light it up,\" Dart said. \"I'm excited. Those are conversations that we have a lot, and we're two of some of the younger guys in the entire league at 22, so we've got a long future together, and there's going to be a lot of great moments. I know that he's been attacking this recovery process, and he's going to come back stronger and better, and he's going to be hungry for sure.\"\n\nDart admitted Nabers' absence stung deeply.\n\n\"He’s an incredible talent. He could beat anybody in the world. When you have a guy like that out there, he's a safety guy who's going to come down with the ball at all costs,\" Dart said.\n\nWith a young core headlined by the Dart-Nabers connection, the quarterback sees winning -- and plenty of it -- on the horizon.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Jaxson Dart bullish on Giants' future, excited for Malik Nabers' return",

    "description": "Yasser Salem has built a business council to advise Mamdani if he wins. The McKinsey alum explains that bosses are open to free childcare.",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: This piece originally ran on November 4, 2025, ahead of Zohran Mamdani's electoral win. We are resharing the story on January 1, when he will be sworn in as mayor of New York City.\n\nIf you read the tabloids, the eve of a potential Zohran Mamdani mayorality has turned Billionaire's Row into 1975 Saigon, with everyone looking to hitch the last flight to Palm Beach.\n\nTo put it more bluntly, the city's wealthiest and most powerful business leaders have some qualms with Mamdani's socialist platform.\n\nHowever, the story is not so simple, says Yasser Salem, a former McKinsey executive building a business council to advise Mamdani if he wins the mayoral election. Sure, the word socialism can cause some tension, Salem, the head of OneNYC, a pro-Mamdani PAC, said, but there are some surprising areas of overlap.\n\nSome, like Jamie Dimon, have softened their message in public as they've gotten to know the candidate. Similarly, in conversations with more than 70 CEOs, Salem told Business Insider that some platform planks, such as universal childcare, are acceptable to many in the city's business community.\n\n\"Some of them have said from the beginning that they understand policies like free childcare as a way to lower the burden of worry, concern, and issues that their employees have that prevent them from being productive at work,\" Salem said. Others took more time, but the affordability crisis is unavoidable.\n\nAccording to a recent study of public data released by his PAC, the average New York family spends over 25% of its income on care for just one child. The group proposes several public-private models for childcare, including some where the costs are shared by the government and the employer — an idea, Salem said, that has \"widespread support.\"\n\nBusiness leaders' main concerns aren't surprising: Mamdani's public safety plans will make the city less safe, and housing proposals will exacerbate the city's housing crisis.\n\nHowever, even in housing, there are areas of agreement, Salem said.\n\nBusiness leaders criticized Mamdani's plan to freeze the rent for rent-stabilized apartments, arguing it would worsen shortages, noting that Mayor de Blasio had tried rent freezes that failed to address the long-term crisis.\n\nStill, both sides agree the long-term fix is boosting supply, Salem said.\n\nThe difference between the business community and Mamdani is in their time horizon. Mamdani's rent-freeze message could help lower rents now and satisfy voters, while his plans for zoning reform and building 200,000 \"truly-affordable\" apartments can solve the deeper problem over time.\n\n\"Are we solving for rent prices going down in four years? Are we solving for rent prices going down today?\" said Salem. \"Because if you're solving for rent prices going down today, supply is not going to do it.\"\n\nAs far as public safety, Salem said the announcement that Mamdani would seek to keep Jessica Tisch on as NYPD commissioner has helped alleviate fears that the city would become more dangerous under Mayor Mamdani.\n\nBusiness leaders also wanted to know how Mamdani's new Department of Community Safety, which would deploy civilian mental health responders to subway stations and to answer some emergency calls, would work.\n\n\"For example, a McDonald's owner in a tough neighborhood gets somebody coming in causing trouble,\" Salem said. \"Do they call 911 and get a mental health worker rather than a police officer?\"\n\nThe answer, Salem told Business Insider, is that these changes will be \"additive\" and that mental health workers will join \"alongside, not replacing the officers on the scene.\"\n\nSurprisingly, he said, taxes don't come up as a big fear. CEOs told them they're willing to pay more if they \"feel that New York is a better place to live as a result.\"\n\nThe announcement that Tisch was staying on helped alleviate some of the more intangible fears of the city's business elite, too, said Salem, such as Mamdani's inexperience or his ideological commitments to socialism, or to the pro-Palestine cause.\n\nAnd Salem, who doesn't consider himself a socialist but instead a \"pro-responsible capitalist,\" also said that he would try to get CEOs to focus on their specific disagreements with Mamdani's policies, rather than focusing on \"labels\" like socialism.\n\nSalem tells CEOs that Mamdani is looking to expand the social safety net, not expropriate their wealth.\"He's not saying we're going to go from the corporate tax rate being 25% to being 75%,\" Salem said.",

    "description": "A New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.",
    "fullText": "United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addresses a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025 \n\nA New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart during which he seemed much more concerned with his appearance than policy.\n\nThe Times published a comprehensive story about the Trump administration’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday in which it suggested that Hegseth began his tenure at the Pentagon “as something of a blank slate on the war.”\n\n“He didn’t have any of his own thoughts on Russia and Ukraine,” an ex-Pentagon official told the Gray Lady. “But he had civilian advisers who did.”\n\nOn Day 4, the freshly minted defense secretary sat at a Pentagon conference table as one of his coterie of advisers argued for an immediate U-turn.\n\nThe ideological godfather of the group was Elbridge A. Colby, grandson of the Nixon-era C.I.A. director William E. Colby. The younger Mr. Colby and Mr. Vance had been introduced in 2015 by an editor at National Review who thought they were like-minded. Nearly nine years later, as Mr. Biden poured billions of dollars into arming Ukraine, Mr. Colby argued that “we would have been better served to put a lot more of that money to use in the Pacific.”\n\nNow, it was one of his disciples, Dan Caldwell, presenting the group’s recommendations to Mr. Hegseth, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other military leaders.\n\nThe Pentagon, Mr. Caldwell argued, should pause delivery of certain munitions that the Biden administration had promised to Ukraine, because, he believed, existing stocks were insufficient to execute America’s war plans around the world. Nor should it use the additional $3.8 billion left unspent by the Biden administration to buy weapons for Ukraine.\n\nGeneral Brown did not speak as Mr. Caldwell wrapped up. He simply shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\n\nDuring a trip to Europe the next month, Hegseth reportedly made sure to powder his nose for the cameras, but declined to answer Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov’s queries:\n\nThe Ukrainians had repeatedly requested a proper sit-down. Instead it would be a brief stand-up affair in an anteroom.\n\nBeforehand, according to an American official present, Mr. Hegseth dabbed his nose with powder from a small compact. “Look commanding,” he told one aide. The handshake with the Ukrainian might be shown on Fox; the president might be watching.\n\nThen the standing meeting began, Mr. Umerov coming in close, taking his voice down to a whisper, assuring the secretary that he knew America’s political and security agenda might be changing. He didn’t ask for new aid. He just needed to know one thing: Would the U.S. military continue to supply the munitions Ukraine was counting on, the ones approved by Mr. Biden? Every delivery sustained the lives of Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines; every delivery that didn’t arrive one day meant those soldiers would die the next.\n\nAgain and again, Mr. Umerov repeated his plea: “I just need you to be honest with me. Just be honest with me.”\n\nHegseth allegedly offered Umerov only nodding.\n\n“He wasn’t pleading for the answer that he wanted, but just for honesty, some indication,” observed one U.S. official. “He was saying: You can trust me; you can trust us. Just tell me what you guys are thinking.”\n\nThe post New York Times Deep Dive Alleges Pete Hegseth Donned Makeup for Ukraine Photo Op — Then Ignored Counterpart first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — CAPITALS 6, RANGERS 3\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Tom Wilson had two goals and an assist to lead Washington past New York.\n\nWilson, who earlier in the day was named a member of Canada’s Olympic roster, got into a fight with Sam Carrick in the second period for at least his second Gordie Howe hat trick — a goal, an assist and a fight — since March 3, 2025.\n\nJustin Sourdif also had two goals and Anthony Beauvillier and Aliaksei Protas each scored for the Capitals, who have won two of the last three games.\n\nAdam Fox, making his return from long-term injured reserve, had a goal and an assist for the Rangers, who have lost three straight. Vincent Trocheck and Braden Schneider also scored.\n\nWith the Capitals tied 1-1 and needing a spark in the second, Wilson rose to the occasion. The 28-year-old came streaking up ice and leveled Noah Laba before getting to the front of the net and roofing a feed from Connor McMichael to restore Washington’s lead as he became the first Capital to hit the 20-goal mark this season. Minutes later, he answered for Laba’s hit, fighting Carrick.\n\nThe fight, initiated by Carrick, put the Capitals on the power play. Sourdif snuck a loose puck past Jonathan Quick, who had 21 saves, to end a 16-game goal drought to make it 3-1.\n\nFox responded with a power-play goal of his own soon after to pull things to 3-2 going into the third.\n\nProtas and Wilson, netting his 200th career goal, added insurance tallies late to cushion the lead.\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) — Steven Stamkos scored his 600th career goal and Nashville beat the Vegas.\n\nThe Predators, in the middle of a season-long seven-game road trip, won for the 12th time in 17 games, including the third of their first four on the trip.\n\nThe win put the Predators (18-17-4) above .500 for the first time since Oct. 16, just five games into the season, when they were 2-1-2.\n\nVegas, meanwhile, lost for the sixth time in seven games. The Knights closed their four-game homestand with a 1-2-1 mark.\n\nNow in his 18th season, Stamkos scored his 18th of the season and ninth against the Golden Knights since they entered the league in 2017. The game-tying goal was part of an unanswered three-goal spurt over five minutes that turned a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 lead for the Predators.\n\nNick Perbix, Reid Schaefer and Michael Bunting also scored for the Predators. Justus Annunen made 29 saves.\n\nFormer Knight Erik Haula, who is two games shy of skating in his 800th game, registered the 200th assist of his career on Bunting’s goal.\n\nMark Stone, who earlier in the day was named to Canada’s Olympic roster, scored his 10th goal of the season, while Ben Hutton added his sixth for the Knights. Akira Schmid stopped 15 shots before being pulled late in the third period for an extra skater.\n\nVegas forward Mitch Marner and defenseman Shea Theodore were also named to Canada’s team. All three of the Knights represented their homeland in the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off.\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Darren Raddysh scored midway through overtime, and Tampa Bay blew three one-goal leads before beating Anaheim for its fifth consecutive victory.\n\nTampa Bay coach Jon Cooper celebrated his 1,000th regular-season game in charge with his 595th victory as the longest-tenured bench boss in the NHL. The Lightning’s coach since March 2013 has also led them in 155 playoff games, won two championships and reached four Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nNikita Kucherov had a goal and an assist as the Lightning skated off with a win in the opener of their three-game California road trip when Raddysh converted a pass from Brandon Hagel, who had three assists.\n\nJ.J. Moser and Brayden Point also scored for Tampa Bay, and Andrei Vasilevskiy made 24 saves.\n\nMason McTavish tied it on a power play with 6:58 left in regulation for the Ducks, who have lost four straight and eight of 10. Jansen Harkins and Beckett Sennecke also scored, and Lukas Dostal stopped 24 shots as the Ducks earned a point for only the second time in six games.\n\nMoser opened the scoring in the first period with his first goal since agreeing to an eight-year, $54 million contract extension last weekend.\n\nAnaheim scored its first two goals off turnovers, with the 19-year-old Sennecke getting the 12th of his rookie season early in the third period.\n\nKucherov scored his 18th goal on a cross-ice pass from Hagel during a power play four minutes later, but the Ducks evened it again when Pavel Mintyukov made an exceptional play at the blue line to set up McTavish for his 10th goal.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Macklin Celebrini had a goal and an assist hours after being selected to play for Team Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics, and San Jose beat Minnesota in a shootout.\n\nCelebrini and William Eklund scored for the Sharks in the tiebreaker, while Minnesota failed to convert on either of its two attempts. San Jose has won three straight following a three-game slide.\n\nIgor Chernyshov had a goal and two assists, and Jeff Skinner also scored for the Sharks. The 19-year-old Celebrini got his 40th assist of the season, passing Mikko Rantanen for second-most in the NHL. Yaroslav Askarov finished with 20 saves.",

    "fullText": "Heading into the 2025-26 NBA season, the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers were consensus favorites in the Eastern Conference. With two months of the season in the history books, the Cavaliers no longer appear to be a viable threat, and the Knicks are still coming to grips with Mike Brown's movement-heavy system.\n\nHowever, New York still has all the tools it needs to be a serious playoff contender. As such, if the Celtics do embark on a deep playoff run, they may find themselves facing off against the Knicks for the second straight season. Even though Boston is playing some inspired basketball, New York would undoubtedly have the talent advantage at almost every position.\n\nStill, the Celtics have been outperforming expectations and have proven that a never-say-die attitude can work wonders. That's why the \"First To The Floor\" podcast recently spent some time discussing how much of a threat the Knicks are to the Celtics' chances of postseason success this season, and whether New York should fear a potential trap series against Joe Mazzulla's team.\n\nYou can watch the full podcast episode by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: The Knicks may need to fear the Celtics",

    "description": "Miami, Seattle, and Dallas are shaping the new creator economy landscape as influencers spread out from LA and NY.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood remains the world's entertainment nexus, but many next-gen creators have decided they don't need a Los Angeles address to make it big.\n\nMiami, Las Vegas, and Seattle all attract more top Instagram influencers per capita than LA, according to new research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm.\n\nThe top two by total creator count were LA (over 12,000) and New York (nearly 11,000), followed by Miami (about 6,000).\n\nOther major creator communities have formed in established film markets, such as Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas, which have emerged due to their lower cost of living and production tax incentives. But other top creator cities — Seattle, Las Vegas, Philadelphia — lie outside those secondary film markets.\n\nThe ability to create content for social platforms from anywhere means creators can build a livelihood from just about anywhere. Talent managers say that, apart from when they want a creator to attend an in-person event, brands rarely request a city-specific creator when seeking a partner.\n\n\"You do have people in LA and New York making the lion's share of the dollars. But now they're increasing everywhere else,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. \"Eventually, there will be a hot influencer in Idaho.\"\n\nLooking at cities by concentration of creators, Miami comes in No. 1, outranking LA and NYC.\n\nSome creators are drawn to places that already have a robust creative community, like Nashville or Las Vegas. Others want to be near fashion and retail, which fuels a lot of the creator economy. LTK, a major e-commerce platform that connects influencers to shoppers, is based in Dallas, as was Neiman Marcus for a long time. Dude Perfect, a superstar creator group known for sports-focused stunt videos, is based in nearby Frisco. Miami, where Alix Earle gained social media fame and often appears, experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes.\n\nCreators also move to be near family and for a lower cost of living. It makes sense for people building a brand based on themselves to work in areas that reflect their identity. The biggest YouTuber by subscriber count, Jimmy Donaldson, a.k.a. MrBeast, chose his hometown of Greenville, NC, as his base.\n\nDude Perfect has recently embarked on a major expansion in Texas. CEO Andrew Yaffe said there's no need to be in LA with access to top brands and talent there.\n\n\"We'll be here as far in the future as we can see,\" he previously told Business Insider. \"There's no shortage of opportunity for us here.\"\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.",

    "description": "The New York Giants are looking ahead to the 2026 NFL draft and here are some prospects they should scout during the New Year's Eve bowl games.",
    "fullText": "On New Year's Eve -- Wednesday -- bowl season kicks into high gear with five games, including the Cotton Bowl Classic, a College Football Playoff matchup. All 32 teams will have eyes on these games, including the New York Giants, who will have a top-7 pick in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nThe Giants could still climb up to No. 1 overall and are likely to trade down for additional draft assets should they pick somewhere in the top-3. Despite rumors and speculation, it's doubtful they target a quarterback with Jaxson Dart, a 2025 first-round pick, under center.\n\nWith limited games remaining, Giants scouts have one final major opportunity to evaluate top prospects in live game settings.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of the players the Giants should key in on today.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Iowa offensive lineman Gennings Dunker\n\nAlthough the Giants' offensive line improved in 2025, they still have some issues along the interior. Greg Van Roten is an impending free agent, and the team has an out in Jon Runyan Jr.'s contract should they decide to move on.\n\nWith that in mind, Gennings Dunker could intrigue them as a potential late-second-round pick.\n\nHere's what Bleacher Report had to say about Dunker:\n\nGennings Dunker is a rugged, powerful in-line blocker built with the right stuff, but will need to kick inside to guard to mitigate his middling movement skills. He has the traits to carve out a role and crack a lineup on his rookie deal in a run-first, play-action-heavy offense.\n\nDunker is a 6'5\", 315-pound offensive line prospect, who entered the Iowa program as a 3-star recruit in the 2021 class.\n\nDunker started 11 games in 2024 at right tackle, earning second-team All-Big Ten honors. He started 11 games at RT during the '23 season and one in '22 at right guard.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Texas tight end Jack Endries\n\nMichigan is a mess right now due to various off-field reasons, but that doesn't mean it will be devoid of prospect talent on Wednesday. The opt-outs on both sides will hurt, but there's still something to watch for.\n\nWhile the Giants don't necessarily need a tight end, they could look for some depth in the mid-rounds, and Jack Endries is an intriguing option.\n\nHere's what NFL Draft Buzz had to say about Endries:\n\nWhat separates Endries from typical move tight ends is his football instincts and technical refinement rather than raw athleticism. He finds soft spots in coverage with veteran-like instincts and has eliminated the concentration drops that plagued his freshman season, but his modest frame and average speed ceiling prevent him from becoming a true mismatch weapon against NFL athletes.\n\nEndries represents the modern evolution of the position where receiving ability often outweighs traditional tight end responsibilities, but his blocking limitations create roster construction challenges that could affect his draft stock. His consistent production and technical soundness suggest he'll find a role somewhere in the middle rounds, yet the inability to contribute meaningfully in run support may cap his upside as anything more than a situational contributor.\n\nMichigan RB Justice Haynes (may not play)\n\nGame notes: Michigan linebackers Derrick Moore and Jaishawn Barham, offensive lineman Gio El-Hadi, have opted out of this game. Meanwhile, Texas had 12 players enter the transfer portal, and several more opted out of this game. There are too many to list, so keep track here.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese\n\nThis is the big game of the day and one that will be heavily attended by NFL scouts. What makes it more notable for the Giants is that several top-end talents will fall right into their range (from No. 1 to No. 7) -- most of whom play positions of need. Moreover, several have already been mocked to the Giants.\n\nGiants Wire has covered safety Caleb Downs quite a bit, so we went with linebacker Arvell Reese in the player spotlight instead.\n\nHere's what Mel Kiper Jr. had to say about Reese:\n\nThis is a complete football player. Reese jumps off the Ohio State tape, playing the game like a veteran. I see natural instincts at the linebacker position that allow him to make plays most guys just can't make, and he has the burst to get home when turned loose as a pass rusher. Reese has been a big riser in this class.\n\nArizona State TE Chamon Metayer\n\nGame notes: Arizona State wide receiver Jordyn Tyson, cornerback Keith Abne, offensive lineman Max Iheanachor, and running back Raleek Brown won't play. Duke corner back Chandler Rivers, offensive lineman Brian Parker, and edge rusher Vincent Anthony will also sit out.\n\nGame notes: Utah offensive linemen Spencer Fano and Caleb Lomu, and edge rushers John Henry Daley and Logan Fano will not play in this game. Nebraska running back Emmett Johnson Jr. will also sit this one out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Prospects Giants should watch during New Year's Eve bowl games",

    "fullText": "Christmas and the NBA have been synonymous since the league’s inception. The very first Christmas Day game was played in 1947 at Madison Square Garden between the New York Knicks and Providence Steam Rollers. The Utah Jazz themselves have been a part of this great Christmas tradition, playing eight games on the beloved holiday.\n\nJazz fans have fond memories of the six wins and probably have forgotten the two losses they’ve sustained throughout, but which is the best Jazz Christmas game? To commemorate this holiday tradition, The Lead has done its research to rank these Jazz Christmas games from worst to best.\n\nDisclaimer: there are only a select few games that have footage to go with them. Each game was ranked by the story behind it, how the game played out, and what players made the biggest impact.\n\nWhen it came to the most lackluster of the games, the Jazz vs the Phoenix Suns was the worst.\n\nThe game was played on Dec. 25, 1982, and the Jazz found themselves struggling to defend throughout the game. At one point in the third quarter, they were down by at least 20. They did manage a small comeback, but it wasn’t enough with the score being 111-101, Suns.\n\nThe only bright spots in that game were the combined effort of Jeff Wilkins, Ben Poquette, and Danny Schayes, scoring 58 of the Jazz’s 101 points. Number seven is the Jazz vs the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe seventh-place game on this list was played on Dec 25, 1977, against the Spurs (one of the last years the Jazz were in New Orleans). This game was between two 70s basketball heavyweights, Pistol Pete Maravich and George Gervin.\n\nThough the Jazz were never really close to winning, they weren’t blown out, and it was a little closer in score. Maravich led the Jazz with 27 points, four steals, and four rebounds. Gervin led the Spurs with 31 points, two blocks, five assists, and one steal. The game also gets bonus points for being the last Christmas game for the Jazz before the move to Utah.\n\nPistol Pete Maravich scored 3,667 points in 83 games over 3 years at LSU.\n\nIf you took the nation's top 83 single-game scoring performances in the last 3 years(not including this season)you'd have a combined 3,465 total points pic.twitter.com/By7PJ7WoPh\n\n— BaseballHistoryNut (@nut_history) December 4, 2025\n\nFor it being the first Christmas Day game, one would think this game would be ranked higher. However, the games to come stand out \n\nThe Jazz had a record of 11-18, though it didn’t stop them from punching above their weight. What the game lacked in story points, it earned in style points – the game was a slugfest between the two teams.\n\nThe Jazz controlled the first half of the game, then the Rockets stormed back to take the lead in the third quarter. Magic happened in the fourth, and the Jazz squeaked by to secure the two-point win over the Rockets. Any game ending with a winning shot is worth watching. Sadly, there was no found footage of the game.\n\nThe leading scorer for the Jazz was Louie Nelson with 21 points, seven rebounds, and two assists. Maravich scored 19 points and added four assists to the cause.\n\nThe fifth pick barely passed the sixth pick by being the Jazz’s first Christmas win in the twenty-first century. The year 2018 marked a new beginning for the Jazz as Gordon Hayward left for Boston and Donovan Mitchell became Utah’s new star.\n\nOn Dec 25, 2018, the league decided to give this exciting young Jazz core a chance on Santa’s big day. They were paired with a Portland Trail Blazers team, looking to prove their dominance.\n\nStyle points for this game were quite low. The first half was quite close, with Damian Lillard putting the Blazers on his back. He ended up with a stat line of 20 points, four assists, and five rebounds.\n\nOnce the Jazz got control of the game in the second half, they didn’t look back. However, player contributions were quite huge.\n\nDefensive beast Rudy Gobert had 18 points, 14 rebounds, and seven blocks. He was aided by Mitchell’s 19 points, two assists, and two rebounds. Even NBA legend Joe Ingles contributed 15 points to the Jazz’s win. Any game with Ingles deserves to be higher on the list.\n\nThis next game had both Jazz and LA Lakers greats going toe-to-toe with each other. Even though it was a blowout victory, the Jazz beating the Lakers alone makes this game legendary.\n\nThe game was a precursor to an amazing Western Conference Semifinals series between the two bruisers that same year. Magic Johnson had a good game of 18 points, 10 assists, three steals, and five rebounds.\n\nKarl Malone showed the league he was Him with 31 points, two steals, and 12 rebounds. Current Jazz color analyst Thurl Bailey added 22 points and seven rebounds off the bench.\n\nNot only did fans see great individual performances, but they also got to see a shoving match between Malone and Johnson. This further added to this game’s repertoire.\n\nPlayed on Christmas Day 1979, the third spot is a story full of triumph and heartbreak.\n\nThe Jazz won pretty handily against their Rocky Mountain neighbors, the Denver Nuggets. How they did it was quite phenomenal. It was a tight game through the second and third quarters. With the game on the line, the Jazz had two heroes emerge to lead them to victory.\n\nThe first player was Jazz all-timer Adrian Dantley, who came in to score 27 points and four assists. The second player to make his impact was a little-known shooting guard named Terry Furlow, who ended up scoring 37 points, five assists, and two rebounds. It was the best game of Furlow’s career.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn’t the biggest impact he made on the league. In the waking hours of May 23, 1980, after partying, Furlow crashed into a utility pole, killing him on impact. Drugs were found in his system.\n\nLakers legend Johnson was a pallbearer at his funeral – a stark reminder of how fragile life is and how important the holidays are to see family members and friends.\n\nAt Terry Furlow’s funeral, stars like @MagicJohnson, Campy Russell, Greg Kelser, and George McGinnis were some of the pallbearers at New Jerusalem Church in Flint. See this vintage @flintjournal photo. He was truly one of the greats.\n\n— Eric Woodyard (@E_Woodyard) January 2, 2018\n\nThe second-best game was set at the height of the Jazz renaissance in the early 2020s.\n\nThe Jazz were set to face the Dallas Mavericks on Dec 25, 2021. Having their best record in years, the three-seeded Jazz were looking to show the league who they were. The Mavericks, on the other hand, were full of a young core trying to prove themselves.\n\nThe game was like two heavyweights dealing blows. The Mavericks would control the game, then the Jazz would make a run. Mitchell had a heyday even while being hampered by an injury, scoring 33 points, three assists, and three steals.\n\nKristaps Porzingis and Jalen Brunson feasted on smaller defenders, scoring a combined 54 points. It took a combined effort from Mitchell, the Flamethrower Jordan Clarkson, and the rest of the starting core to win in the fourth quarter.\n\nOut of all of the games, this was one of the most entertaining, with both teams having trouble keeping a lead. It also had great performances from individual players.\n\nIt was tough to decide between the number one and number two picks. Both were great games and featured great performances. However, number one was a better game with Jazz greats playing to their fullest. Much like pick two, the number one game was a back-and-forth conundrum.\n\nBoth the Jazz and Rockets were getting a piece of each other in the early half of the season. On Christmas Day, 1997, fans got to see a preview of an iconic playoff series. It wasn’t until the third quarter that the Jazz managed to keep a small lead.\n\nJohn Stockton robbed the world of a Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets NBA Finals.\n\nJordan, Pippen, Rodman vs. Olajuwon, Drexler, Barkley would’ve been must see TV and the Rockets owned the Bulls back then.\n\nRockets in 6 https://t.co/AEzZxM47rH pic.twitter.com/5ifMVJeO8I\n\n— V̷a̷t̷o̷r̷ (@VatorSports) May 28, 2023\n\nThe Rockets weren’t done and ended up coming back to tie the Jazz 101-101 in the fourth quarter. John Stockton took over and scored four major points to put the team ahead. Kevin Willis answered back with a tip-shot to put the Rockets within striking distance. Bryon Russell struggled off the bench but drew a foul to shoot two free throws to ice the game.\n\nStockton scored 24 points and tallied three assists, while Malone added 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Jeff Hornacek made a huge contribution as well with 20 points and nine assists.\n\nNot only did Stockton, Malone, and Hornacek outduel the likes of Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, and Willis, but it was a glimpse of a great Western Conference finals matchup, showing why this game is worthy of the number one pick.\n\nThe post What is the Best Christmas Day Game in Jazz History? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "fullText": "I'll never forget my first train cabin. Before I'd spent 140 hours on overnight trains in the US and Europe, I had no idea what to expect of my 30-hour journey from New York City to Miami in October 2021.\n\nFor my first overnight Amtrak trip, I was set on having a bed in a private space. So I spent $500 on a roomette accommodation — the cheapest private cabin I could find.\n\nThe 22.75-square-foot cabin contained two beds, a toilet, and basic amenities. Thanks to clever storage hacks, it felt like a tiny hotel room with no unused space.\n\nSee inside the most affordable Amtrak ride in a private cabin.\n\nInside the enclosed space with a sliding door, I found two seats, a table, and a bed above the seats that pulled down. The seats also pulled out into a bed.\n\nI thought this was a big step up from sitting in coach, where you get one train seat and sit with other passengers.\n\nI was also surprised to be able to control the temperature inside my roomette with a dial and air conditioning vents. I kept it cool, about 66 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFor dinner, I had braised short ribs, mashed potatoes, and a hard roll. While I didn't love the meal as it came, I made a little sandwich out of the ingredients, which tasted better to me.\n\nI decided to try sleeping on the top bed. I thought the available blankets wrapped in plastic were surprisingly soft and comfortable.\n\nWhile I found the train movement through the night a little unsettling, I appreciated the dim, blue light on the wall next to me. It was my favorite feature of the roomette because it reminded me of my colorful night light at home.\n\nAfter 30 hours in a roomette, I would book the accommodation again. But for those looking for more room to stretch out, I recommend the Amtrak bedroom.",

    "description": "New York Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka: \"I don't have any doubts\" that Jaxson Dart is a franchise quarterback.",
    "fullText": "New York Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka offered glowing praise for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart on Monday, declaring unequivocally that the young signal-caller has already established himself as the team's franchise quarterback.\n\n\"I don't have any doubts about that,\" Kafka said when asked if he believes Dart is a legitimate NFL franchise quarterback.\n\nDart, who entered the season as the backup before taking over as a starter, has impressed Kafka with his natural leadership that extends beyond the offense.\n\n\"I've seen Jaxson just become more comfortable in that role,\" Kafka said. \"It's not about forcing anything, it's just about being himself and leading the way that he sees it and bringing guys along with him. Those are the qualities that we've seen since the first day he's gotten here.\"\n\nKafka noted that Dart's influence has reached the defense, with players there citing his leadership.\n\n\"I don't think there's an age requirement for leadership, whether you're young or old or a veteran or one year or one month or however many,\" Kafka said. \"I just think if you have the leadership qualities, if you have the ability to, number one, lead yourself and then lead others, and guys will follow you based on how you operate and how you carry yourself, then I don't think there's necessarily like a prerequisite for that.\n\n\"I mean, Jaxson does a great job because he's just being himself and he's controlling what he can control. He's doing all the things that make him great and he's just being himself. He's not trying to be somebody else. He's just his genuine self.\"\n\nOn Dart's development, Kafka highlighted the typical leap from Year 1 to Year 2.\n\n\"I think you learn so much faster from year one to year two. You have that full season, you're in the NFL style, you kind of know how things operate. You've built somewhat of a framework of a routine on how you want to prepare yourself,\" he said. \"Now you have time after this season to go through, kind of refine the things that you want, how you want to operate in the offseason, and now you have some time to kind of look back and really dissect yourself and really can make some more steps to improvement.\"\n\nKafka, who has coached Dart since his rookie arrival, called him \"a pleasure to coach.\"\n\n\"He's been awesome. Learning every single day, absorbing as much information as he can, and then also putting his own fingerprint on things,\" he said. \"You see a player that's continuing to learn from the good, the bad, and then continuing to take steps forward... take ownership and take accountability and hold other guys accountable.\"\n\n\"I'm proud to be working with him and happy for him, and I'm excited to continue to do that,\" Kafka concluded.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Mike Kafka doesn't 'have any doubt' Jaxson Dart is a franchise QB",

    "title": "Backyard tiny homes are finally legal in New York City. They could be a boon for homeowners who can afford construction.",
    "description": "The NYC government has begun accepting applications from homeowners who want to build an ADU, including a backyard tiny home, on their property.",
    "fullText": "It's open season for some New York City homeowners interested in building a tiny home in their backyard.\n\nUnder a sweeping zoning reform Mayor Eric Adams signed into law late last year, the city made it legal for certain one- and two-family homeowners to add an additional home, also known as an \"ancillary dwelling unit\" or ADU, to their property.\n\nOn September 30, 2025, the city finalized its rules for backyard and attic ADUs and began accepting applications from homeowners, although the government is still working on the rules for basement units. The city estimates that the reform — part of its City of Yes for Housing Opportunity package — will help create about 25,000 new homes in backyard cottages and converted garages, attics, and basements over the next 15 years. But the success of the reform will depend in large part on homeowners navigating high construction costs and regulations.\n\nWil Fisher has spent the last year preparing for this. The former city government employee founded a Queens-based firm, Unit Two Development, that helps homeowners determine whether their property is eligible for an ADU and connects them with contractors and others who can help them build one. Fisher said he and his team have identified well over 100,000 eligible individual properties, and they've talked with more than 100 of these homeowners, who largely live in Queens and Staten Island.\n\n\"The rules of the road are now written,\" Fisher said. \"It was a long process, but for the most part we're off to the races.\"\n\nMost of the people Fisher has talked with are interested in adding an ADU to house a family member, including an aging parent or a relative with disabilities who needs care, or an adult child.\n\nMaggie Ornstein is one of these homeowners. Ornstein, 47, lives with her mother in a house in western Queens that has been home to five generations of her family since the 1800s. She hopes to build an ADU for her mother, who's undergoing treatment for cancer and is having difficulty navigating the stairs in their two-and-a-half-story home.\n\nOrnstein, a public health geographer, has consulted with Fisher and determined that she could legally convert her garage into a home.\n\n\"My dream for an ADU on my property would be something that would be accessible, but might also have a second floor where a family member could potentially stay if they wanted to visit, or if I wanted to be with my mom in the ADU,\" she said.\n\nAfter months of planning and big picture discussions with potential clients, Fisher is starting to nail down the specifics of what his clients could build and what it might cost.\n\n\"Now is sort of the pivot from the conceptual to here's exactly what it will take, and here are the cost implications of that,\" he said.\n\nOne inevitable obstacle homeowners face is the steep price of building in the city. Fisher estimates that adding a backyard unit or converting a garage will start between $300,000 and $400,000, depending on the project's size. That's compared to the city's median home price of $800,000.\n\nThe construction cost is out of reach for many homeowners who'd benefit most from adding an ADU to their property, said Thomas Yu, executive director of Asian Americans for Equality, an advocacy organization and affordable housing provider. Yu said there needs to be a much clearer and more affordable path to adding an ADU before the regulatory reform will unleash construction in lower and middle-income neighborhoods. He suggested tax abatements or grants for homeowners with more modest means.\n\nMany of the New Yorkers Yu and his team work with live in overcrowded homes with multiple generations of their family. They could benefit from having a home for an older relative or an adult child who couldn't otherwise afford to stay in the city.\n\n\"The ability for that generation to achieve independent homeownership is zero, particularly in New York City,\" Yu said of younger New Yorkers. \"So ADUs are the next half-step that's needed for that.\"\n\nOrnstein said she's been discouraged by the price tag on her potential project. She's also turned off by how extensive and involved the construction would likely be, especially given her work schedule and caregiving responsibilities. She's hoping to find some government funding to help pay for the project.\n\n\"It's so much more expensive than I would have anticipated,\" she said. \"On the one hand, you wouldn't be able to buy an apartment in New York City for what an ADU would cost to build. But on the other, it's really a lot of upfront cost.\"\n\nThe expense and hassle of adding an ADU might not make sense for homeowners who are just looking for rental income, Fisher said. But he expects the units will be easily rentable for those who want a tenant either immediately or in the future. Adding an ADU also tends to hike the property's resale value.\n\n\"As far as I'm seeing, construction costs are a little too high for them to be a slam dunk rental investment from day one,\" Fisher said. \"But for folks who have a relative or an immediate need that exists within their own family or social network, these are going to be good investments in the long term.\"\n\nADU construction is also limited by a slew of regulations. The units can't be bigger than 800 square feet or take up more than a third of a homeowner's backyard. The law also restricts basement ADUs in areas prone to flooding and prohibits them in attached homes, like townhouses.\n\nThe Regional Plan Association, a pro-housing nonprofit focused on the tri-state area, found that just 68,000 lots — 12% of the city's one- and two-family properties — are eligible to add an ADU.\n\nThe city says it's creating a \"one-stop shop\" full of information for homeowners interested in building an additional unit. The site will include a set of public, pre-approved backyard ADU designs submitted by architects, designers, and builders that homeowners can use to lower design costs and speed up the construction process.\n\n\"Efficiencies that can be built in are really going to be make or break for this market,\" Fisher said.",

    "fullText": "Mike Brown believes the New York Knicks have 'The Guy' to compete for a championship originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks are considered by the majority of the NBA as the favorite to win the Eastern Conference. Before the season even started, the expectations were high for the Knicks, considering the Indiana Pacers lost their superstar guard, Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nNow, the Knicks are not the number one seed, but they have the strongest chance of succeeding in the postseason. They also have a superstar who can carry them to victory in Jalen Brunson. With that kind of star power, it is hard to count out the Knicks in any game they play.\n\nDuring the Knicks' game against the New Orleans Pelicans, Jalen Brunson once again showcased his star power with 28 points and 10 assists. It was yet another superb performance by the Knicks, which is their third win in a row.\n\nWith that victory, they are only one game behind the Detroit Pistons, who are at the top of the Eastern Conference. The Pistons have lost two games in a row, which could mean the Knicks can keep fighting for the number one seed in the East.\n\nMore: Josh Hart's message fueled Knicks' historic Christmas comeback\n\nKnicks head coach Mike Brown always loves to hype up his players, including Brunson. He thinks that Brunson is good enough to be called one of the special players who can propel a team to a championship.\n\n\"You gotta have a guy. We're talking about a league MVP, and we have a guy. he definitely makes the game easier for everybody, for sure,\" Brown said after the game against the Pelicans.\n\nMoving forward, the Knicks will continue to fight in the upper echelon of the Eastern Conference. They are playing under heavy pressure because of their status as preseason favorites. The Cleveland Cavaliers have crumbled under that pressure this season, as the Knicks will hope to live up to the hype.\n\nWith how they have succeeded this season, including the NBA Cup victory, the Knicks can keep living up to expectations. It will be challenging, but Brown, Brunson, and the rest of the Knicks will do their best.\n\nMikal Bridges injury update: Latest news on Knicks guard's status vs. Pelicans\n\nKnicks star Is on pace to Join NBA’s elite crucial offensive stat\n\nNBA legend blasts Knicks decision not to hang NBA Cup banner: 'Celebrate the win'\n\nKnicks former NBA Draft pick gets granted four years of college eligibility\n\nSix New York Knicks featured in The Ringer's new Top 100",

    "fullText": "There could be two new starting quarterbacks entering the AFC East next season, as the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins could be looking for an upgrade.\n\nThe Dolphins decided to bench quarterback Tua Tagovailoa earlier this month, while the Jets’ signing of free agent quarterback Justin Fields did not pan out.\n\nNew York is in a much better position to draft a rookie quarterback in the first round of the 2026 NFL Draft, with it currently holding the No. 3 pick.\n\nDalton Wasserman from Pro Football Focus released a mock draft on Monday, predicting that the Jets will select Oregon quarterback Dante Moore.\n\n“The Jets’ passing game is in desperate need of improvement, so they select their new franchise quarterback, Oregon’s Dante Moore,” Wasserman wrote. “Moore enters the College Football Playoff quarterfinals with a 91.8 PFF passing grade and 28 big-time throws, both of which place him among the top three qualified quarterbacks in the nation.”\n\nMoore has appeared in 13 games this season, throwing for 3,046 yards and tallying 28 touchdowns, along with eight interceptions. Moore has only started one full season in college, which means he could decide to return to school next season to get more game action before heading to the NFL.\n\nPatriots’ Rival Listed As Best Trade Landing Spot For Maxx Crosby Next Season",

The Athletic’s James L. Edwards III broke down Hart’s lower-body setback on Saturday.\n\n“New York Knicks do-it-all guard Josh Hart will miss at least the next three games with a right sprained ankle,” Edwards reported.\n\n“Hart suffered the injury in the fourth quarter of New York’s Christmas Day victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.”\n\n“Hart, per league sources, is still undergoing further tests and will be reevaluated when the Knicks return from a three-game road trip that begins against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday and ends with the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.”\n\nThere’s no question it’ll be difficult for the Knicks to be the best version of themselves without Hart in the lineup.\n\nThe Villanova product is among the best rebounding guards in the league, always plays under control, is an underrated downhill attacker, and is a much-improved perimeter shooting threat.\n\nHart is averaging 12.3 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game with New York this season, shooting 49.8% from the field and 38.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nHopefully, Hart isn’t sidelined for an extended period.\n\nMore NBA: Golf could play surprising factor in Lakers' LeBron James' retirement decision",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf the New York Yankees are serious about landing another ace-caliber arm, Hunter Greene is the type of guy who fits exactly what they’d be looking for. He’s 26 years old, has elite stuff, and is under team control until 2029.\n\nHowever, that’s why prying him from the Cincinnati Reds wouldn’t be cheap.\n\nCincinnati has no reason to move Greene unless the return is incredible. He isn’t a rental, and he isn’t anything short of a star. He’s a prime-aged arm the Reds can build around, so any trade conversation would start with the Yankees giving up multiple top prospects.\n\nSB Nation proposed a trade that shows just how high the price would be.\n\nIn the pitch, the Yankees would send George Lombard Jr. and Elmer Rodriguez as the headliners, along with two additional prospects, likely from their upper-level pitching group. The Yankees' upper-level pitching is as good as any in baseball.\n\n“Given his age (26), ability, and contract terms, it’s difficult to find a good comp for the type of package it would take to pry him from Cincy. The Red Sox’s trades for Chris Sale and Garrett Crochet are fairly decent, the Astros’ acquisition of Gerrit Cole and Orioles’ move for Corbin Burnes less so.\n\n“At a minimum, it looks like the Reds could demand a pair of consensus top-100 prospects plus at least another pair less-heralded youngsters. It’s not a stretch to imagine the Reds demanding George Lombard Jr. and Elmer Rodríguez in addition to several of the impressive crop of upper level pitching prospects,” Peter Brody wrote.\n\nPerhaps the Yankees will want to add a bat with those prospects instead of a pitcher, but having another arm like Greene is never a bad idea.\n\nYankees should add former NJ HS standout, Tigers big leaguer with near .900 OPS vs. left-handed pitching\n\nYankees linked to free agent Blue Jays All-Star as huge Anthony Volpe upgrade\n\nHow Yankees' Cody Bellinger decision could lead to big trade rumors\n\nYankees 'Plan B' if Kyle Tucker, Cody Bellinger sign elsewhere revealed\n\nESPN trade rumor has Yankees acquiring two veteran stars from Twins\n\nYankees urged to swap Jasson Dominguez to Marlins for 6'5'' ace",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOnce the New York Yankees feel comfortable with how the lineup looks, the next move feels obvious. The rotation still needs help.\n\nNew York has enough arms to get through the regular season, but that’s not really the idea here. Injuries are already part of the conversation with Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodon, and there isn’t much if they were to be hurt.\n\nSure, the Yankees' staff is decent, but it needs to stay healthy.\n\nSigning depth helps, but it doesn’t change that reality.\n\nIf the Yankees decide to be aggressive, it’s likely going to be via trade rather than another short-term signing. They’ve shown a willingness to deal from prospect depth when the fit makes sense, and I’d expect that to be the case again this winter.\n\nThat’s where Freddy Peralta comes into play. The Milwaukee Brewers right-hander is under control, elite, and capable of handling a significant workload.\n\nHe’s the type of starter who would change things for New York.\n\nAlexander Wilson of Empire Sports predicted the Yankees will pivot in that direction once the lineup is settled and sign Peralta.\n\n“Once the lineup is secured, I expect Cashman to aggressively pivot to the rotation by targeting Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta. The Yankees and Brewers already have a well-oiled trade pipeline, established last winter when New York sent Nestor Cortes and Caleb Durbin to Milwaukee for Devin Williams.\n\n“While the recent move where the Yankees re-sign Paul Blackburn to a one-year, $2 million contract provides depth, it does not move the needle for a team trying to win a World Series. Peralta is the legitimate frontline hammer that helps protect a unit already dealing with major injury questions,” he wrote.\n\nIf the Yankees make a move, it’s hard to see it being for another depth arm. A pitcher like Peralta fits what they’d be trying to accomplish at this stage of the offseason.\n\nYankees’ Cody Bellinger predicted to ‘settle’ on $170 million deal amid quiet start to free agency\n\nYankees trade proposal involves George Lombard Jr. for front-line starter who throws 100-plus MPH\n\nYankees should add former NJ HS standout, Tigers big leaguer with near .900 OPS vs. left-handed pitching\n\nYankees linked to free agent Blue Jays All-Star as huge Anthony Volpe upgrade\n\nHow Yankees' Cody Bellinger decision could lead to big trade rumors\n\nYankees 'Plan B' if Kyle Tucker, Cody Bellinger sign elsewhere revealed",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Western New York’s latest winter storm has prompted Gov. Kathy Hochul to issue an advisory to caution commuters to stay off the roads and work from home if they can Monday.\n\nWith whiteout conditions expected at times along with wind gusts projected to reach upwards of 75 miles per hour — as well as the potential for flooding — Gov. Hochul is urging anyone who can to stay off the roads Monday evening, especially during the evening rush hour commute.\n\nWIVB News 4 was able to speak with Gov. Hochul on Sunday evening over the phone, where she also encouraged Western New Yorkers who can to work from home and avoid going out on the roadways.\n\n“Western New Yorkers, myself included, we think we’re tough, we can handle anything, but when you’re on the roads and there’s 50, 60, 70 mile-an-hour winds and the wind is blowing, it is a dangerous condition. And we want to encourage people if you can, stay off the roads, especially during tomorrow night’s commute from 4 to 7,” Gov. Hochul told News 4. “Just over the next couple of days if you can work remotely or stay home with the kids, forget returning that one item to the store that you don’t like for Christmas, you can do that later, just help us keep the roads clear. Stay home, stay safe.”\n\nAhead of the worst of the storm Monday, Gov. Hochul emphasized how her administration will continue to coordinate with local leaders to help keep Western New Yorkers safe from what’s expected to be, at times, a very severe winter weather event for parts of our area.\n\nA state of emergency that was declared by Gov. Hochul on Friday for more than half of New York’s counties remains in effect headed into Monday in anticipation of the worst of the storm.\n\nA flood watch has also been issued for parts of Western New York, as a slight risk of excessive rainfall is possible as a result of the storm. One to two inches of rain could cause flooding around rivers, creeks, streams and other low-lying areas.\n\nParts of Western New York could see between 1 and 2 feet of snow with this system, combined with high winds and cold temperatures. Snowfall rates of up to two inches an hour and strong winds will create significant blowing and drifting snow and near whiteout conditions in lake-effect areas.\n\nState and local leaders continue to coordinate ahead of the worst of the storm, taking steps to close certain highways where conditions could be very dangerous and life-threatening.\n\n“New Yorkers should monitor local forecasts and take caution to avoid travel in impacted areas,” Gov. Hochul said in a statement. “Plow crews, emergency management teams and utility personnel have been deployed and are ready to keep New Yorkers safe throughout the storm.”\n\nBeginning at 6 a.m. on Monday morning until further notice, an empty tractor trailer and tandem ban will be taking place on the following state highways in Western New York:\n\nI-90 (Thruway Authority Section from Exit 46 to the PA Line both east and westbound)\n\nI-990 (I-90 to State Route 263 Millersport Highway)\n\nRoute 400 (I-90 to State Route 16)\n\nRoute 219 (I-90 to State Route 39)\n\nThe City of Buffalo on Monday morning issued a travel advisory, effective immediately. The advisory was issued due to gusty winds combined with incoming snow creating “extreme whiteout conditions, reduced visibility, and hazardous travel conditions.”\n\n“City officials urge residents to avoid unnecessary travel, use caution if travel is required, and allow additional time to reach destinations,” the advisory said. “The City will continue to monitor weather conditions and provide updates as needed. Residents are encouraged to stay informed by signing up for BuffAlert, the City of Buffalo’s emergency notification system.”\n\nFor real-time travel information, motorists should call 511 or visit www.511NY.org, New York State’s official traffic and travel information source.\n\nRob Petree is an anchor and reporter who joined the News 4 team in 2025.

    "title": "Miami has the most top Instagram influencers per capita in the US, beating out LA and NYC",
    "description": "Miami creators, influencers, and social media personalities are finding success as the city becomes a creative hot spot.",
    "fullText": "Los Angeles has the entertainment pedigree, but there's another city in the US that's home to even more top influencers per capita: Miami.\n\nVale and Sebastian Genta understand why. The siblings and social media personalities moved back to their hometown of Miami in 2021, after spending five years in LA. The pair, who post about their glamorous lives and occasionally offer a wry take on influencing, wondered what their move would mean for their careers. They were pleasantly surprised.\n\n\"Miami was a completely different city,\" Vale said. \"The amount of events in Miami, the amount of people that are there, brands that are present, it's almost as much as LA.\"\n\n\"Many of us know each other, so if you go to events that Gucci is throwing at the Design District, you're more than likely going to bump into five to 20 familiar faces,\" Sebastian said of the upscale fashion and design neighborhood.\n\nThe Gentas aren't alone. New research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, reveals that Miami consistently ranks as the No. 3 metro area in the US by top Instagram creator count, after LA and New York City.\n\nMiami boasts over 6,000 top Instagram influencers. LA has roughly 12,000, and NYC nearly 11,000. (Seattle was next, with about 4,000.)\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm. Adler said that other platforms, such as YouTube and TikTok, showed similar trends.\n\nMiami still has a ways to go in absolute numbers to catch up with LA and NYC, long known as the centers of US media and entertainment, but it's punching way above its weight. It's only the sixth-largest market by population and the seventh-largest traditional entertainment market.\n\nLooking at the data another way, Miami actually has more top influencers per capita than LA.\n\nOther markets that regularly came up in the top 10 by this measurement are creative hot spots like Las Vegas, Atlanta, Houston, and Nashville.\n\nVictoria Bachan, an SVP at Wasserman Creators, said that for the new guard of independent creators, being in LA or NYC matters less.\n\n\"Take the biggest YouTuber in the world, MrBeast — he's in Greenville, NC,\" she said.\n\nMiami experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes. Creators found a growing number of events like Formula 1's Miami Grand Prix, which debuted in Miami in 2022, as well as the Miami Open tennis tournament and Art Basel Miami Beach, which offer places for them to be seen. Brands like Geico and Vuori also seek out personalities there when they want to tap into the Miami lifestyle and Latino culture.\n\nTop Miami influencers include breakout TikTok star Alix Earle, who gained social media fame while attending the University of Miami, and Xandra Pohl, a DJ and model. The scene features prominent food influencers like Samantha Schnur, known as The Naughty Fork, and Nico Norena.\n\nCities like Miami have also offered a haven for Angelenos struggling with the high cost of living in LA and early 2025 wildfires, Wasserman Creators' Bachan said.\n\n\"They're crunching the numbers, and a lot of them did pick up and move to Atlanta and Vegas and Miami,\" she said.\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.\n\n\"We saw a mass exodus,\" she said.\n\nLA is still the entertainment capital in terms of population. But this new data adds to the narrative of a traditional entertainment industry in decline.\n\nLA has lost ground in traditional film and TV, with the rise of lower-cost film hubs elsewhere. A growing number of A-listers have decamped for other cities.\n\nStill, there are limitations to living in secondary markets for certain types of creators. Being in LA or NYC is considered important in the industry if you aspire to be a Hollywood actor and want to collaborate in person with other creators and attend major events.\n\n\"Our advice is if you want to make money, have an address in New York and LA,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. Some managers also caution against moving outside the US, saying it can impact your ability to get brand deals.\n\nThe Genta siblings said they wish Miami had a bigger TV and film scene to help their peers who are seeking those opportunities. They started #NextGen Creators, an events series where creators can learn and mingle with brands.\n\n\"Many creators want to move on to traditional media, like hosting television, acting, whatever that may look like, and I do think Miami still lacks in that,\" Sebastian said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump struggled to offer much sympathy for the families of about 100 Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nAn estimated several thousand Americans have volunteered to fight for Ukraine since Russian dictator Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, with at least 92 Americans killed as of September, The New York Times reported.\n\nFollowing a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a peace deal to end the war, Trump was asked about his message to the families of the fallen Americans.\n\n“The message is so obvious,” he replied. “What a shame. They died in a foreign country. And some are celebrated people, they’re very celebrated. But it’s so sad that a thing like that would happen.”\n\nHe then immediately moved on to the next question.\n\nSocial media users quickly noted that the president hadn’t thanked the fallen for their sacrifice, praised their commitment to freedom and democracy, or even offered his personal condolences.\n\nMany of the Americans who have died in Ukraine were U.S. military veterans.\n\nMike Meoli, 71, was a retired Navy Seal and firefighter who traveled to Ukraine to train medics on the front lines. He was killed in November 2024, ABC 10 News San Diego reported.\n\nNicholas Maimer, 45, was an Army Special Forces veteran and Idaho native who helped train Ukrainian officers. He was killed in May 2023 in an artillery barrage, according to Military.com.\n\nIan Frank Tortorici, 32, was a retired corporal with the U.S. Marines who fought on the front lines. He died in July 2023 after a Russian missile hit a restaurant where he was eating while on leave, Task and Purpose reported.\n\nThe U.S. government has declined to provide aid to American fighters to avoid any suggestion of a direct clash with Russia, which is a nuclear power, the Times reported in September.\n\nBut some social media users argued that Trump’s barely-there compassion for their families wasn’t measured diplomacy—it was reminiscent of the president’s previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during World War I were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.\n\nAlthough he failed to offer much comfort Sunday to the families of Americans who have died fighting Russia, Trump did manage to heap praise on the man who started the war.\n\n“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, prompting Zelensky to raise an eyebrow. “I was explaining to the president [Zelensky], President Putin was very generous in his feeling toward Ukraine succeeding.”\n\nHe also said he “understands” Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire while a longer-term agreement is being hashed out.\n\n“He feels that look, you know, they’re fighting and to stop, and if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn’t want to be in that position—I understand that position,” Trump said.\n\nPutin bombarded Ukraine with over 100 drones on Christmas Eve and early Christmas Day, killing at least seven civilians.\n\nSunday’s talks were intended to address security guarantees and possible territorial concessions, and while both sides said progress had been made, neither gave any indication that a deal was within reach.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Here's a look at the studs and duds (and those in between) from the New York Giants' 34-10 win over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders met in the desert on Sunday afternoon in a game where the loser had more to gain than the winner.\n\nThe two 2-13 teams entered the game on nine-game losing streaks, and the loser would be in prime position to pick first overall in next year's NFL draft.\n\nThe Giants haven't picked first overall in the NFL draft since 1965. For reference, that's two years before the Super Bowl era began. That streak will continue as they will now likely settle for the No. 2 pick, or lower, after besting a depleted Raiders team that put up very little resistance.\n\nIn that 1965 draft, the Giants chose Auburn fullback Tucker Frederickson first overall. San Francisco then took running back Ken Willard, who would go on to be a four-time Pro Bowler, with the second pick. The Chicago Bears had the next two picks and selected two future Hall of Famers -- Kansas running back Gale Sayers and Illinois linebacker Dick Butkus -- in rapid succession.\n\nFrederickson had a solid rookie season in '65 and was named to the Pro Bowl. Unfortunately, he blew out his knee the next season and was never the same. He retired after the 1971 season.\n\nSunday's win was only the second time this season the Giants led a game wire-to-wire.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the studs, duds, and in-betweens from the Giants' 34-10 Week 17 win over the Raiders.\n\nThe name is pronounced Wan'Dale, by the way, if anyone is interested. CBS play-by-play man Kevin Harlan repeatedly failed to get that right, but it didn't matter much to Giants fans. Robinson ate up the soft Las Vegas back seven, reeling in 11 of his 14 targets for 113 yards, putting him over 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career.\n\nAs stated, the loser would likely get the No. 1 pick in next year's NFL draft. But after watching this outfit, one has to wonder if that will even make a difference. They made sure that they were as toothless as possible coming into the game, shelving All-Pros Maxx Crosby and Brock Bowers, along with top defender Jeremy Chinn, this week. A \"soft tank,\" if there ever was one. Fernando Mendoza should pull an Eli if the Raiders pick him.\n\nThe Giants decided to let Dart be Dart, and so did the Raiders. He took advantage by rushing nine times for 48 yards and two touchdowns. He also completed 22 of 20 passes for 207 yards for a 91.9 QB rating. If he can beat Dallas next week, we'll crow a little bit more about him.\n\nIt was a day to pad the stats, and Burns did just that. He recorded 1.5 sacks on the day and now has 16.5 on the season with one game remaining. He had four total stops and three QB hits on the day.\n\nOkereke led the Giants in tackles with seven and had his first interception since the middle of the 2023 season.\n\nBelton continues to make plays. He also had seven stops and an interception. The Giants have to seriously consider re-signing him.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Studs and duds from New York Giants' Week 17 win over Raiders",

    "description": "Should the New York Jets consider bringing in another veteran bridge quarterback this offseason?",
    "fullText": "The New York Jets placed quarterback Justin Fields on season-ending IR earlier this week. It all but guarantees the end of Fields' disappointing tenure in East Rutherford. The Jets could release him this offseason and absorb a $22 million dead cap charge by doing so.\n\nDespite the somewhat sizable financial penalty, Fields' pending release feels like a foregone conclusion. Fellow veteran quarterback Tyrod Taylor is on an expiring contract. Taylor probably won't be back with the Jets in 2026 either.\n\nGeneral manager Darren Mougey will be tasked with acquiring at least one, maybe two, quarterbacks this offseason. Currently equipped with two first-round selections in the 2026 NFL draft (and three more in 2027), the Jets could target a quarterback in this year's class like Fernando Mendoza or Dante Moore. With the Jets currently slated to pick 4th and 18th overall, that may require a slight but aggressive move up the draft order.\n\nMougey should also consider bringing in another bridge quarterback. Right now, there's no guaranteeing the Jets end up with Mendoza or Moore. Even if they do, an experienced mentor could accelerate their development.\n\nIn recent memory, rookie quarterbacks who enjoyed immediate success were experienced college quarterbacks. Jayden Daniels, Bo Nix, Cam Ward, and Tyler Shough were multi-year starters. Other successful NFL quarterbacks like Justin Herbert, Drake Maye, and Jordan Love weren't Week 1 starters, and in Love's case, sat for multiple seasons.\n\nMendoza has 945 career collegiate passing attempts (and counting). Moore is a first-year starter. Not making comparisons, but recent draft picks who busted like Zach Wilson (sorry, Jets fans) and Trey Lance were inexperienced and asked to do too much right away.\n\nKyler Murray, Tua Tagovailoa, and Geno Smith (imagine that, ha) are among the veteran quarterbacks expected to be available this offseason. Murray and Tagovailoa may not be \"bridge\" options by definition based on the financial commitment needed. But someone like Jacoby Brissett or Malik Willis would be an upgrade on Fields/Taylor while buying the Jets time to develop a rookie quarterback, or draft one in 2027 instead of 2026.\n\nMougey has big decisions to make this offseason.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Should the Jets consider bringing in another bridge QB this offseason?",

    "description": "Maren Droubay moved from Salt Lake City to NYC with her husband and five children. She says her family is thriving despite the cost of living.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Maren Droubay, a 32-year-old who moved from Salt Lake City to New York City with her family. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy husband and I are from the Salt Lake City area of Utah, and we have five young kids.\n\nWe appreciated being close to family, nature, and a city with a variety of dining options and entertainment. But we always wanted our kids to have more exposure to different parts of the world and different lifestyles than what we felt they were getting in Utah.\n\nUtah is home, but we found ourselves traveling all the time. We were always on the road. We used to homeschool our kids so that we could travel.\n\nWe thought moving to New York was an impossible dream. We visited a lot and loved the feeling in the city.\n\nIt took us 10 years before the opportunity finally presented itself when my husband got a job in New York. We moved from Salt Lake City to New York City on October 10, 2025.\n\nMoving our family from Utah to New York was probably in the top 10 hardest things I've ever done.\n\nWe lived in an older house, so we had to do a lot of updating to get it ready for the market, sell it, and get it under contract.\n\nWe moved from a six-bedroom home to a three-bedroom apartment, so we really had to downsize — everything from furniture and lawn tools to our two cars had to go. I decreased all of our clothing to a quarter of what we had.\n\nYou have to uproot everything when you make a move like this, from finding new doctors to getting our kids enrolled in school. I am so relieved that it feels so worth it. Every day, I cannot believe we live in New York.\n\nTo find our apartment, I connected with people through Facebook groups or Reddit who were looking to sublease or have their lease taken over.\n\nI posted, \"We're moving. We need three bedrooms. This is the ideal block radius we want to live in. Does anyone know of anything?\" One person reached out to me and said, \"I am moving that very month to a different neighborhood. My apartment has three bedrooms. It has laundry and an elevator.\"\n\nIt was like kismet. It's the perfect apartment for us. We had Facetimed and looked at it, but we hadn't walked through it ourselves until we moved. We were just living on a prayer, and it worked out.\n\nWe have a large bedroom at the back of the apartment that my three boys are in, and they're on a triple bunk bed. Our two girls are in the second bedroom, with a mini crib for the baby and a twin bed for my little girl that can be turned into a queen when guests come. Our bedroom is at the front, and we have two bathrooms.\n\nWe have an incredible view of the skyline and the Statue of Liberty. We put my kids in the room with that view. When they ran into their new bedroom and looked out the window for the first time, it was one of those core memories that you never want to forget.\n\nTo prep the kids for the move, we had a family meeting and asked them if they were interested.\n\nThey've always been good travelers and here for a new experience, so they were immediately excited. We had a family meeting every week, where we answered questions or showed them pictures of New York.\n\nWe also made a family bucket list for things to do when we moved. We've been checking those items off on Saturdays.\n\nThe sadness hit when we said goodbye to our house in Utah. It's the only house the kids really knew, and Utah has the only friends they have ever known. Their grandparents and cousins live there.\n\nWe just let the kids feel the feelings. They know it's OK to feel happy and sad or excited and scared at the same time.\n\nI was nervous about how the city would react to my family. Would people respond well to a family with five kids? Would our apartment neighbors like us? Would the people on the subway be annoyed by us?\n\nI have been pleasantly surprised by how kind 99% of people have been. I will get to the subway, and before I even fold up my stroller, strangers pick up the other end and carry it for me. Everyone stands up and offers seats to my kids, or older women have even grabbed one of my kids' hands and helped them on or off the subway for me.\n\nThe community aspect of NYC is so different from our experience in the suburbs, where you live in a lot more isolation. You're in the car and then back at home. In New York, you're required to interact with so many people and make connections.\n\nStill, it's been hard being away from our support system. In Utah, we had friends and family we could call at any point for help. Building a new village will take time.\n\nOur budget is so much more expensive now. Our mortgage doubled. Our groceries have probably gone up by 30%. We were paying $2 for cereal in Utah, and now it's $10 at our local supermarket. Costco and Target are pretty close in price to what they were in Utah, but now we're paying for delivery fees.\n\nOur weekly spending has also doubled because we've been obsessed with eating out since we arrived, but I know that probably won't stick.\n\nSome things are more affordable than we expected. Public transit is affordable, and we no longer have to pay for car payments, gas, or car insurance. New York residents get in for free to most of the museums, and kids get in free for pretty much everything in the city.\n\nMy husband is 10 times happier because he's actually working in the city where his job is located. He's way happier, and I'm way happier.\n\nIt's always been my dream to make my kids' childhoods magical. There was this phrase I heard early on in motherhood: \"It's their day, too. It's their life, too. It's their childhood, too.\"\n\nI have the power as their parent to give them amazing experiences and memories. I always think about when they're adults, what do I want them to think back on and remember from when they were growing up?\n\nYou don't just have to do what your parents did or what your siblings do or what everyone in your city or neighborhood does. If you choose to, that's OK, too. But you can take life by the reins and change it.\n\nI hope someday my kids will thank me for these experiences and see the effort that their dad and I have put into trying to give them a phenomenal life.",

    "fullText": "Every house has a unique smell that is said to be unrecognizable until you're away for a period of time. Despite the constant comments from friends and visitors about the smell of my childhood home, I couldn't have described it to you until I moved away from home.\n\nAs the oldest of three sisters who grew up with two nurturing parents and involved grandparents nearby, my home and family mean everything to me. My family has always been my rock: from attending my first Pride parade with me when I came out as queer in high school to having my entire family drive six hours each way to move me in when I went to college.\n\nSo, when it came time for me to pursue my long-sought-after goal of moving to New York City, I knew I would have my family's support, but it wouldn't make leaving any easier.\n\nI come from a long line of ambitious and driven people, so even as a kid, there was never any doubt in my mind that I would move to New York at the first chance I could. Following in my parents' footsteps, who also met and started their life together in the city, all of my childhood birthday trips and summers in college spent working in Brooklyn led up to the moment I finally got offered my dream job as a sex educator in New York.\n\nI knew nothing was going to get in between me and my dream, and yet the reality sank in that moving would change what my immediate sense of family would look like. Although visiting my family was only a short drive away, I didn't know what it would feel like to miss out on family walks with my dog, the never-ending late-night talks with my sisters, or the now identifiable oaky cinnamon smell of my house every day.\n\nWhile I wasn't sure what lay in store for this new period of my life, when my best friends from college, Elliot and Ike, found an apartment just a walk from my own, I started to see the pieces come together.\n\nIn the early months of my relocation to New York, I was finding my footing within the community and among friends. Despite Elliot and me living objectively close by, it was different from our shared walls in college. Nonetheless, we quickly ritualized our ocean documentary watch parties and park picnics, but this time in a new setting.\n\nEverything changed again when I met my now girlfriend. We moved in together, still close to my best friends, and I felt my own family growing before my eyes. Suddenly, the familiar sounds of living with my family started to take shape, but in a new tune: the jingle of her keys walking up to the door after a day of work, the pitter-patter of our cats running around the apartment, the rattle of the wind against our windows in the winter.\n\nI had found my home, and thought things couldn't get any better.\n\nAfter some time nesting in my beautiful apartment with my girlfriend, two apartments in my complex became miraculously available. It was somehow perfectly aligned with my best friends searching for a new apartment and my sister and her partner moving in together. Within a three-month window, I no longer had to wait for holidays and hometown visits to have family dinners or game nights; I had my own queer family in New York.\n\nMy move taught me that family can grow wherever you are, and mine happened to be right next door. Now, I feel the small day-to-day intimacies of living with family restored when my weekly grocery shop becomes a sisterly activity or when I can stay in my pajamas to borrow a baking sheet from my best friend.\n\nWhile I know this living situation might not last forever, there is something even more special and grounding in its impermanence. Just as I once moved away from home, it's possible that one day my best friend, my sister, or even I will embark on a journey that leads us elsewhere. But if that happens, I will always remember the smell of vanilla in my best friend's apartment or the herbal scent of my sister's studio and think of my neighbors, friends, and family.",
