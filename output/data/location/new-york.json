    "description": "New York Giants QB Jaxson Dart has had multiple conversations with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce about OC Matt Nagy.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants bolstered their offensive staff with the hiring of Matt Nagy as offensive coordinator, positioning him to guide second-year quarterback Jaxson Dart under head coach John Harbaugh.\n\nNagy, who previously coordinated for the Kansas City Chiefs alongside Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce—contributing to multiple Super Bowl runs—brings extensive experience after stints as the Chicago Bears head coach and earlier roles.\n\nDart, coming off an encouraging rookie campaign where he amassed 24 total touchdowns and just seven turnovers across starts, proactively sought insights on his new coordinator.\n\nESPN's Jordan Raanan reports that Dart engaged in multiple conversations with Mahomes about working with Nagy, emerging impressed by the feedback. During Super Bowl week, he also consulted Kelce, who offered glowing endorsements of his former play-caller.\n\nDart, fresh off a rookie season with 24 total touchdowns and seven turnovers, talked on multiple occasions with Mahomes about working with Nagy, according to multiple sources close to the QB. He came away impressed. He also told reporters last week that he spoke with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce about his former coordinator and received rave reviews.\n\nIn an exclusive Forbes interview, Dart elaborated on his enthusiasm.\n\n\"I can’t wait to get the chance to play for him. Just so many great things that are said about him and his coaching style and the work that he puts in, the passion that he has for the game,\" he said.\n\nDart praised Nagy as a \"quarterback guy\" who prioritizes putting players \"in the best situation and position to succeed,\" and tailors approaches to individual QBs. Dart noted Kelce \"didn’t have anything but tremendous things to say about Coach Nags,\" reinforcing positive views from Chiefs stars.\n\nNagy's scheme aligns well with Dart's strengths, with minimal expected adjustments from prior systems.\n\nThis \"loaded\" staff, including other ex-caches and coordinators, signals the Giants' commitment to Dart's growth as they aim to elevate their offense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Jaxson Dart spoke with Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce about Matt Nagy",

    "description": "A man who moved from  New York to Miami was prepared to feel lonely. He reached out to an old acquaintance for lunch and found a close friend to share retirement with.",
    "fullText": "Relocating to a new city is a mixed bag — especially when you're nearing retirement.\n\nWhen I moved away from home for grad school in 1990 at age 28, it was easy to socialize, since I was surrounded by classmates eager to make friends.\n\nBut in 2021, when I moved from New York to Miami for work at age 58, it was much harder to meet new people. The COVID-19 pandemic was still lingering, and I tried to connect with colleagues over a socially distanced lunch, but I couldn't really join clubs or meet neighbours. I found it hard to expand my relationships beyond work.\n\nI wondered how I'd make any friends, but later that year, I reached out to an old acquaintance and learned that it's possible to make good friends at any age.\n\nAfter arriving in Miami, I read articles about how to make friends as an adult. Some suggested rekindling old acquaintances. The logic seemed wiser than starting from scratch. I could reach out to people I already knew, or used to know even a little bit.\n\nI looked through my Facebook friends and LinkedIn connections for people who lived in Miami. I paused on Bruno's name because he brought back good memories. We had worked together seven years prior, when our respective companies collaborated on a project. I valued his ability to drive impressive results and radiate infectious positivity. He'd mentioned at the time that he appreciated how I kept the project on track.\n\nI hesitated to reach out. Our interactions had been friendly, but we'd only connected through work. Would it seem odd to Bruno to get an email from me after all these years? And was I leaping too far by suggesting a personal lunch?\n\nI swallowed my fears by crafting a friendly note, rereading it three times, and hitting send. The next day, Bruno responded warmly: \"Welcome to Miami. I look forward to having lunch.\"\n\nWhen the lunch came around a few weeks later, it went better than I expected. In addition to chuckling over old war stories about work, we discovered that we were both news junkies, avid travelers, and cyclists. At the end, Bruno said, \"That was really fun. You and your girlfriend should come over to our place for an Argentine barbecue.\"\n\nBruno and I started lunching roughly every other week. I was approaching 60 and itching to leave my job, and Bruno was already semi-retired. As someone on the cusp of a new life chapter, I valued having a friend at the same juncture.\n\nWe'd frequently talk about all things retirement, like the best investment strategies for our retirement portfolios, including how much risk to take and how many international stocks to hold. Discussions with a wise friend were much more satisfying than reading through reams of investment advice. We could debate, candidly admit our concerns, and test our logic. I became wiser and more confident.\n\nAs we grew closer, we discussed our hopes and anxieties about stepping off the corporate treadmill. I explained my desire, after decades of work, to release myself from the self-imposed pressure of always being productive. Bruno shared that he'd dealt with similar feelings, which made me feel validated. Our conversations gave me the confidence I needed to take the plunge and enter retirement in 2022, without feeling as guilty as I might have done about working less and enjoying myself more.\n\nSince I've retired, Bruno has been a valued companion. With no work schedules, we almost felt like we were playing hooky when we attended a weekday lecture by the Finnish ambassador to the US and took a day trip to see a touring Rembrandt exhibit. These post-retirement experiences are richer because I can share them with a friend who also enjoys exploring, joking, and giving his insights.\n\nI once mistakenly assumed that you can't form close friendships later in life, without the social intensity and openness of youth. When I first moved to Miami, I thought I'd make some acquaintances or group friendships, rather than forming any deep bonds. I was prepared to feel somewhat lonely.\n\nLast summer, Bruno and I escaped Miami's heat by flying to Upstate New York for a cycling trip. He fell on some railroad tracks, breaking his collarbone and ribs. In the emergency room, I whispered, \"Let's tell them I'm your brother, so I can stay past visiting hours.\" I sat by his side until his procedures were done at 4 a.m., keeping him entertained with the type of stories and gallows humor that only good friends share. We tried not to laugh too hard, so his ribs wouldn't jab him.\n\nBruno has since recovered and even bravely gotten back on his bike to meet me for meals again. During a recent get-together, he told me, \"Some people are really surprised that I found such a good friend later in life.\"\n\nI replied with a smile, \"What do you mean, friend? I thought we were brothers.\"",

    "title": "Ole Miss QB coach Joe Judge says comments about players' pregnant partners were 'taken out of context'",
    "description": "The former New York Giants head coach faced a backlash after discussing the intersection of child-rearing and football.",
    "fullText": "Ole Miss quarterbacks coach Joe Judge released a statement Saturday after a quote from a court appearance went viral, insisting that his comments about fathers of newborns prioritizing their sleep were \"taken out of context.\"\n\nThe comments were given Thursday during the hearing for Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss' request for an injunction to play a sixth season of college football. That injunction was granted Friday.\n\nOne clip of Judge's testimony took off in particular, in which Judge recounts telling the partners of players with young children that they need to prevent those children from waking them up in the middle of the night.\n\nNEW: Ole Miss coach Joe Judge tells pregnant partners of players during the season that the father has to play good football.\n\n“He needs to be in another room, detached… he ain’t waking up for midnight feedings.” pic.twitter.com/LQG7t0fQtX\n\n— College Transfer Portal (@CollegeFBPortal) February 12, 2026\n\nNotably, that clip identifies Judge as an Ole Miss coach and refers to unspecified players, but what it does not mention is the conversation at the time was about Judge's experience dealing with sleep disorders while in NFL player development with the New England Patriots.\n\nIn his statement, Judge clarified that the conversations about playing football while raising a child were only in the NFL, never the collegiate level:\n\n\"Some of my comments from Thursday have been taken out of context, so l'd like to provide some clarity. In a discussion about Trinidad's sleep apnea, I was trying to point out the importance that the NFL places on sleep for recovery and performance in addition to the education of balancing family dynamics during the football season.\n\n\"These are discussions I was a part of at the professional level from veteran players based on their own experience managing similar situations. These are not discussions we've had at the collegiate level. As a husband and father of four children, I understand those challenges first hand and would never diminish the commitment to family. We share that same dedication to family with our players and always support them through any challenges they face in their personal.\"\n\nJudge worked under Bill Belichick from 2012 to 2019, became head coach of the New York Giants in 2020, then moved back to the Patriots after his firing in 2022. He joined Ole Miss in 2024 and currently holds the titles of quarterbacks coach and \"head coach of offense\" (John David Baker is the offensive coordinator under head coach Pete Golding).\n\nIn the interest of clarity and not taking Judge out of context, here is the larger exchange about dealing with NFL players with sleep disorders:\n\nQ: \"Can a sleep disorder affect a player's ability?\"\n\nQ: \"Has that occurred in your past where you have encountered players with sleep disorders?\"\n\nQ: \"And what did you do for those players?\"\n\nA: \"Well, we got them the CPAP machines. We tracked their sleep. We made sure they were evening out their sleep cycles, that they're properly rested. That was several players over the course of years.\n\n\"And then there was also the players that we would have to educate — this is always a tough conversation to have. It's not a popular opinion, this is the truth, we would have to educate significant others who may have been pregnant during the season, or were going to have a baby during the season, and you'd have to educate them on — you have this baby in the middle of the season, that father has to play good football. It's a day-by-day production business. He has to be ready to perform and go out there and play, and when I say that is, you need to let him sleep. He needs to be in another room, detached.\n\n\"You have to explain to the mother, 'Listen, he ain't waking up for the midnight feedings. After the season, he's full metal jacket. You can do whatever you want with him, he'll change every diaper. In season, he's got to have a different priority.\n\n\"Now, there were examples to use from that. We had some older veteran players — I can or can't share names if you want me too — who had multiple children who would sleep in other rooms. Their wives would bring in family or a nursing aid to help throughout the night, and those players continue to play high-level football. We had other players who are young who quite simply did what every other father in the world does, waking up, changing diapers, doing feedings, and led to injuries, led to soft-tissue injuries, not being rested, not being recovered, not being ready to roll.\"\n\nQ: \"That never occurred to me, that newborns can affect injuries on the football field. But who had to deliver that message?\"\n\nQ: \"And to whom did you deliver the message?\"\n\nA: \"About as good as you'd expect (laughs).\"",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants are signing wide receiver Courtney Jackson to a reserve/futures contract.\n\nThe move comes shortly after the conclusion of the 2025 season, in which Jackson was a member of the practice squad for the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks. The 5-foot-11, 179-pound receiver provides depth at the position and potential special teams value, particularly as a return specialist.\n\nJackson, 24, began his college career at Syracuse University (2019–2022), where he appeared in 36 games and recorded 63 receptions for 662 yards, while also handling punt returns, including a touchdown. He transferred to Arkansas State University (2023–2024), playing in 26 games and totaling 81 catches for 1,183 yards and 9 touchdowns.\n\nAcross his collegiate career, he amassed 144 receptions for an average of 12.8 yards per catch and 13 receiving scores, plus solid return contributions (14.0 yards per punt return on 40 attempts and 20.3 yards on kickoffs).\n\nUndrafted in the 2025 NFL draft, Jackson initially signed with the Denver Broncos as a free agent but was released before joining Seattle's practice squad in August 2025. He spent the year there, earning a Super Bowl ring despite not appearing in regular-season games.\n\nThe reserve/futures deal secures Jackson's rights for the 2026 season, allowing the Giants to evaluate him during offseason programs. This low-risk addition addresses receiver depth and bolsters the return game amid broader roster changes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants sign WR Courtney Jackson to reserve/future contract",

    "title": "So long, New York: Why Bethenny Frankel says Miami is the 'new LA'",
    "description": "The \"Real Housewives of New York City\" star and entrepreneur, Bethenny Frankel, is among wealthy Americans to move to Florida from cultural hubs like New York City and LA.",
    "fullText": "The former \"Real Housewives of New York City\" star Bethenny Frankel built her public persona in the Big Apple, but after moving to Florida in 2025, she says the Sunshine State is the new cultural hub for America's rich and famous.\n\n\"Miami is the new LA,\" Frankel, 55, told Business Insider. \"In the way that LA was the cool place to be, and aspirational people wanted to be there.\"\n\nLast March, the reality TV veteran, entrepreneur, and social media influencer joined a wave of New Yorkers relocating to South Florida, settling on the coast with her teenage daughter.\n\nShe's one of many Americans leaving cultural hubs like New York and Los Angeles for smaller cities in the Sun Belt. A January 2026 Bank of America Institute study on US migration found that New York recorded the second-largest population loss of any US city in the fourth quarter of 2025, after Los Angeles. About 45% of outbound New Yorkers headed southward, with Miami alone accounting for 7% of departures.\n\n\"It's also cool to be in New York,\" Frankel said, \"but not as much as being in Miami, and Florida in general.\"\n\nAmong the Florida arrivals is a number of billionaires. Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Glenview Capital Management's CEO, Larry Robbins, have all relocated from northern cities to Florida's warmer shores in the past four years.\n\n\"Rich people are moving down here,\" said Frankel, who runs the private membership dating community The Core. \"Miami's exploded, real-estate-wise.\"\n\nData backs that up. Realtor.com's December 2025 Luxury Housing Report found that the Miami metro area had the highest number of million-dollar listings in the country, snatching a title that had traditionally been held by New York. More than a quarter of demand in the Miami metro region originated from the New York metro area, the report found.\n\nFrankel said the influx of new wealth has changed Miami's cultural landscape. \"It means shopping, art, nightlife, the real-estate cool factor,\" she said. \"Everybody went where the money is. The money is dictating what's happening on social media, and what's happening that's cool.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Lucia Moses reported in December that Miami is emerging as a hub for social media influencers. It had the highest number of top Instagram creators per capita of any US city, ahead of New York and LA.\n\nFlorida's draw in recent years, however, has extended beyond just billionaires and social-media influencers. Business Insider previously reported that differences in tax policy and cost of living meant that someone earning $150,000 a year could save roughly $50,000 annually by moving from New York City to Miami, largely due to Florida's lack of state income tax.\n\nFor Frankel, the move offered more than that. She said it has made her \"more social\" and allowed her to run her businesses from the \"sunniest and most beautiful-weathered place.\"\n\nWhile Florida has drawn in large numbers of domestic migrants since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Miami has begun to hemorrhage residents. The Bank of America Institute study found that Miami recorded the third-largest domestic population decline among US cities in the fourth quarter of 2025, with many residents relocating to more affordable parts of Florida, including Orlando and Tampa.\n\nIn Frankel's views, the whole state is having a moment. \"Delray, Palm Beach, Boca, Miami, the Design District,\" she said. \"Florida is on fire.\"",

    "fullText": "A custom suit is the signature look on Wall Street, and it's New York's tailors who keep the city's bankers, stockbrokers, and lawyers looking sharp.\n\nSome of these businesses have been city fixtures for decades, while others are newer arrivals that have quickly built reputations in the finance world.\n\nHere's a look behind the scenes at three of the tailor shops that serve Wall Street, and who owns them.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Alan Flusser's shop near East 48th Street and Fifth Avenue has been a fixture for Wall Street clients. Flusser designed the wardrobes of the iconic movies \"Wall Street\" and \"American Psycho.\"\n\nWhen Flusser retired in 2020, Sigmon, who had previously worked for Suitsupply, took the reins.\n\nHe described the house style to Business Insider as relaxed and \"guided by proper proportions meant to flatter the individual\" rather than trends.\n\nLS Mens Clothing on West 45th Street and Sixth Avenue is a family business that first opened in 1954.\n\n\"I've been doing this for 42 years,\" Zuber told Business Insider.\n\nIn his decades-long career, he's observed some notable shifts in styles.\n\n\"People are dressing thinner,\" he said. \"They're dressing thinner in the arms — even the conservative people, the business people.\"\n\nBefore opening Michael Andrews Bespoke, Andrews trained as an engineer and later worked as a corporate attorney. Required to wear a suit daily, he said he struggled to find off-the-rack options that met his standards.\n\nHe started having custom suits made, and went on to study tailoring.\n\nHe launched the business in 2006, and the flagship is store on Great Jones Alley in NoHo, between Broadway and Lafayette. The newer store is on West 20th Street, between Sixth and Seventh avenues.\n\nIt also has locations in Washington. D.C., Miami, and soon London.\n\n\"The vast majority of our clients are either investment bankers, finance guys, private equity, your typical New York finance guy, or lawyers who, to a large degree, service the financial industry,\" Andrews told Business Insider.\n\nIn 2024, Michael Andrews Bespoke employed three new full-time and two part-time tailors.\n\nRising demand for alterations led the business to hire a further two staff members in NYC the following year, bringing the total to four full-time and three part-time tailors in 2025.\n\n\"We've had dozens of clients bring back entire wardrobes,\" Andrews told Business Insider. \"For a couple of clients, it's 20 to 40 pieces that we've had to take in because they've lost 20 to 30 pounds.\"\n\nSigmon and Zuber also told Business Insider that demand for alterations, mostly take-ins, is growing as Wall Street clients' waistlines shrink.\n\nAs Andrews put it, \"the Ozempic effect is real.\"\n\nRead more about how GLP-1s are reshaping Wall Street.",

This year's event kicked off in the depths of a bitcoin bear market, but the exuberance—irrational or otherwise—was on full display throughout the halls.\n\nAn abundance of bitcoin-orange ties and a jubilant mood were the vibes of the whole event.\n\nChris Klein, COO of crypto retirement platform Bitcoin IRA, insisted that the crypto community isn't worried about the current market downturn.\n\n\"Every eighteen months we go through something like this, so if anybody's been in this space long enough, this is the third or fourth time they've been through this,\" he said. \n\nSam Callahan, director of bitcoin strategy and research at digital asset treasury OranjeBTC, echoed the sentiment, saying that seasoned crypto investors remember bear markets much worse than the current decline.\n\nThe bitcoin bear market has dragged on for about four months now, with prices down as much as 50% from the peak earlier this month. They've recovered slightly but are stuck around $70,000, with no clear catalyst on the horizon. Still, for retail and institutional investors, the deep freeze doesn't appear to be souring the mood.\n\nMike Novogratz, CEO of digital asset investment firm Galaxy Digital, revealed that he's been buying more bitcoin recently in anticipation of shifting macro conditions and policy updates.\n\nCathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management, continued to describe bitcoin as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, adding that she thinks blockchain technology is poised to play a role in the next phase of the tech boom.\n\nAnd Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, one of Wall Street's loudest tech bulls, said that he doesn't think anyone can be bullish on tech without being bullish on bitcoin, predicting there will be more use cases for it in the near future.\n\nThe attendees who spoke with Business Insider on the sidelines of the event were equally bullish, donning bitcoin pins on blazer lapels and sporting orange ties in tribute to bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor.\n\n\"These conferences during market drawdowns are refreshing,\" Klint Drici, head of institutional sales at Arch Lending, a crypto-backed loan platform, said. \"They showcase the real builders and operators.\"\n\nIndeed, there were almost as many bitcoin entrepreneurs as investors at the event, boasting about projects they had in the works even as crypto winter deepened.\n\nEran Barak, founder of blockchain consulting firm Breem Group, said that he thinks the macro landscape is shifting in a direction that favors bitcoin, citing regulatory developments on the horizon.\n\n\"As the CLARITY Act moves closer to approval and Fed rate cuts are increasingly expected, funds and enterprises are viewing Bitcoin as a treasury diversification tool—boosting its perceived value as fresh liquidity flows into the market,\" he stated.\n\nMany of the crypto pros at the event didn't quite agree on when bitcoin might rebound, but all maintained that it should stage a comeback this year. Real estate entrepreneur and investor Grant Cardone, who spoke about his bitcoin investing strategy, told Business Insider that he thinks it could move horizontally in the short term before gaining fresh momentum.\n\n\"I think it could go sideways til the Fall or late Summer,\" he said. \"It could touch $40,000, could touch $38,000 and still hit $180,000 before the end of the year.\"",

    "description": ", Shariq Khan, Marianna Parraga and Arathy Somasekhar NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Valero Energy is set to buy up to 6.5 million barrels of Venezuelan crude in March bound for its Gulf",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Valero Energy is set to buy up to 6.5 million barrels of Venezuelan crude in March bound for its Gulf Coast refineries, making it the top foreign refiner of the OPEC country's oil ‌since the United States captured President Nicolas Maduro in January, sources said on Friday.\n\nWhat role is Valero playing in Venezuelan crude imports?\n\nWhat are Venezuela's current oil production and export levels?\n\nHow do recent U.S. sanctions changes affect Venezuelan oil?\n\nHow much Venezuelan oil revenue is under U.S. control?\n\nValero was among the first U.S. refiners to resume imports of ‌Venezuelan crude after the United States struck a flagship $2 billion oil supply deal with the country's interim government and began to ease sanctions. If Valero succeeds in snapping up 10 or more cargoes ​next month, equivalent to around 210,000 barrels per day, it could surpass U.S. oil major Chevron as the top U.S. refiner of Venezuelan crude.\n\nThat would also be the most Venezuelan crude oil Valero would process since the United States first sanctioned the country's oil industry in January 2019.\n\nChevron, the only U.S. major producing oil in Venezuela, is expected to boost exports of Venezuelan crude to some 300,000 bpd in March, from 220,000 bpd in January, sources told Reuters last month. Chevron typically refines up to half of ‌those exports at its own refineries, and sells the ⁠rest to other U.S. refiners.\n\nA large portion of Chevron's sales of Venezuelan oil to U.S. refiners typically goes to Valero. In March, Chevron is expected to supply Valero with most of the volume the refiner is planning to import, six sources said.\n\nValero ⁠has also negotiated some cargoes from trading houses including Trafigura, which were the first companies authorized by the U.S. government last month to join Chevron in trading Venezuelan oil.\n\nVitol has separately scheduled three naphtha cargoes to be delivered to Venezuela's state company PDVSA between February 22 and March 3, according to a shipping plan seen by Reuters.\n\nThe sources cautioned that ​loading ​schedules have not been finalized and are still subject to revision. They spoke on condition of ​anonymity to discuss confidential information.\n\nVitol and Trafigura declined to comment. ‌Chevron and PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA Valero spokesperson referred to comments made by executive Randy Hawkins after its fourth-quarter earnings release on January 29. In those comments, Hawkins confirmed Valero was in talks with authorized sellers of Venezuelan crude and expected it to make up a \"pretty large part\" of its heavy-crude purchases in February and March.\n\nValero, which has the second-largest U.S. refining network capable of processing Venezuelan heavy oil, had a long-term supply agreement to buy crude from PDVSA before U.S. sanctions.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A former high-ranking official in the New York Police Department has been charged with accepting $35,000 in cash, luxury travel perks and other bribes from a Florida businessman seeking to sell panic buttons to the city’s public schools and police.\n\nIn an indictment Thursday, federal prosecutors said Kevin Taylor attempted to steer an $11 million contract toward the company, SaferWatch, while serving as the commanding officer of the NYPD’s School Safety Division. The company markets its product as a “mobile panic alert system” used for mass shootings and other emergencies.\n\nIn exchange, the company’s founder, Gene Roefaro, showered Taylor and his romantic partner with gifts — including luxury hotels and airfare to the Bahamas and Las Vegas, helicopter tours, tickets to Broadway musicals and a “medieval-themed dinner theater” — along with multiple cash payments, prosecutors said.\n\nTaylor pleaded not guilty to bribery and wire fraud charges on Thursday. An emailed inquiry to his attorney was not returned.\n\nRoefaro is also facing charges, including bribery and wire fraud. He has not yet entered a plea. An attorney for Roefaro said it was “puzzling and deeply concerning that the United States Attorney’s Office has chosen to pursue charges against Geno, while at the very same time, alleging — and seeking to prove — that he was the victim of an extortionate shakedown.\"\n\nThe charges are the latest allegations of corruption and favor-trading lodged against officials appointed by the city’s former mayor, Eric Adams, who faced his own indictment in a separate bribery scheme that also involved luxury travel gifts.\n\nWhile the case against Adams was later abandoned by the Trump administration, at least some of the probes into his inner circle remain active, including an ongoing bribery case involving his former chief advisor. In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have announced bribery charges against two other NYPD officers and a former housing official under Adams.\n\nThe investigation into SaferWatch first emerged in September 2024 as part of a sprawling federal probe into the Adams administration. The company was one of several to hire a consulting firm run by the brother of two top Adams officials, both of whom resigned after their homes were searched by federal authorities.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege that in 2023 Taylor helped secured a no-bid contract to pilot Roefaro’s products within the command center of the NYPD’s school safety division. But as the police official struggled to expand the program, Roefaro grew frustrated, at times describing himself as a “sugar daddy” who had “made a MAJOR investment and zero return,” according to the indictment.\n\n“It’s been fun, but it’s not fun or funny anymore,” Roefaro allegedly texted Taylor in late 2023. “Our company (ME) needs to report something real and significant that is in place prior to end of year.”\n\nDays later, Taylor tried to put together a press conference to announce his division would be procuring a tip line from Roefaro's company, prosecutors said. But that event was later cancelled.\n\nDuring roughly the same time, Taylor was also attempting to solicit $75,000 in bribes from two businessmen involved in a company that sold bullet-resistant vests to police, according to the indictment. Both men declined his solicitations, prosecutors said.",

    "description": "Trump abandoned his longtime home state of New York in 2019 amid multiple civil and criminal probes into his conduct",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Friday suggested that he could make his post-presidency home near a North Carolina military base instead of the gilded Florida social club where he’s lived since leaving his longtime New York home to avoid various investigations into his conduct.\n\nTrump was winding his way through remarks to soldiers at Fort Bragg that were little different from his usual political stump speech when he began boasting about the “billions” his administration is purportedly investing into improvements to housing and other facilities on the sprawling military base.\n\nHe also claimed his administration would similarly spend “billions of dollars” on improvements “here and around the area” to “make it great” because “people in this area have been so incredible.”\n\n“In fact, I'm thinking about moving here someday. Maybe I'll, maybe I'll move here with our great movie star ... with our First Lady,” he said, referring to first lady Melania Trump, who had also traveled to the base in a rare joint appearance with her husband.\n\nTurning to his wife, he said: “We'll move to Fort. Bragg. Would you like that, darling?”\n\nThe first lady, who seemed to be there as much to promote her documentary as to ride along on to Mar-a-Lago afterward, laughed and seemed to nod, at which point Trump resumed speaking, telling the assembled soldiers: “She loves you.”\n\n“It’s a possibility — actually, it's not a bad idea, because we love it,” he said.\n\nWhile the president’s remarks were made in jest, he does have some family ties to the Tar Heel State through his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native who has twice considered but rejected chances to run for open Senate seats there.\n\nTrump and his wife previously changed their primary residence in 2019, when they filed documents to officially shift their domicile from the eponymous New York skyscraper where he’d lived since 1983 to Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach, Florida mansion where he maintains quarters while using the gilded age-era residence as a social club for dues-paying members.\n\nAt the time, he claimed to “cherish” the Empire State, where he lived from birth through the start of his first term in the White House in 2018 but complained that he’d been “treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state” amid multiple civil and criminal investigations into his conduct there.\n\nThe first lady’s appearance alongside her husband — only one of a select few speaking engagements she’s had with him since his return to the White House — comes weeks after the premier of a hagiographic documentary about her preparations for his January 2025 inauguration that was purchased by Amazon for $40 million in what critics derided as a blatant payoff to her and her husband.\n\nAmazon also reportedly spent $35 million to market the film, which thus far has brought in just over $13 million in box office revenues since it was released in theaters last month.\n\nTrump referenced the documentary’s box office performance in his remarks to the troops, telling them that the United States “is truly blessed to have such a phenomenal First Lady.”\n\n“And now she’s a movie star,” he said.",

    "fullText": "She attended the designer's fall runway show wearing a high-neck halter gown made from gauze-like fabric.\n\nIt wrapped around her body, creating a subtle see-through effect, and its skirt extended into a short train.\n\nShe wore it with a fuzzy jacket that she carried around her waist.\n\nShe made an appearance at the Tory Burch fall/winter runway show wearing a preppy look from the brand. It comprised a white pleated skirt with a black, button-up blouse tucked in.\n\nUnfortunately, the two pieces sat loosely on Anderson and appeared too formal.\n\nHer leather belt, sheer tights, pointed heels, and black purse added some fun to the look, but the base layers were ultimately too simple for them to work.\n\nWhile entering the Ralph Lauren show, Reinhart was photographed wearing a brown tweed blazer as a top with a thick brown belt holding it closed at the waist.\n\nShe also wore a long black skirt covered in leather fringe, which added texture and contrast to the ensemble.\n\nHigh black boots and a small brown purse completed the fun, fashion-forward look.\n\nAlso at the Tory Burch show, Seyfried wore a golden, long-sleeved blouse atop a blue midi skirt with silver stripes. She also wore white heels with silver adornments and carried a blue purse.\n\nThe mix of two metallic shades with blue tones created a unique, fun color combination that complemented her hair and skin tone.\n\nOutside the Tory Burch runway show, the Olympic gymnast was photographed wearing an oversize blue jacket with a form-fitting wrap skirt in a vibrant red shade.\n\nThe two pieces were drastically different in style, and they overwhelmed her petite frame. They also didn't match the lime-green top she wore or her black accessories.\n\nThe \"Stranger Things\" actor attended the show in blue jeans, a button-up top, and a leather jacket that matched his sneakers and Coach purse.\n\nThe latter piece was especially fun. It featured a prominent pocket reminiscent of a coin purse and two keychains that looked like miniature books.\n\nMcLaughlin has been one of the best-dressed men at New York Fashion Week so far.\n\nThe model sat in the stands wearing skinny black pants with a billowing blouse. The semi-sheer white garment had a high neckline, balloon sleeves, and extra fabric at the waist that extended into a train.\n\nThe top piece was dramatic and memorable, while her pants were perfectly tailored to highlight her dramatically pointed heels.\n\nFor the Michael Kors runway show, the actor wore an all-white ensemble that included trousers, a loose-fitting blouse, sneakers, and a trench coat.\n\nThe outfit would have worked for him if it featured more than one color. Because the entire ensemble was stark white, each piece blended into the others, creating the illusion that he was wearing a baggy jumpsuit.",

The deal transfers ownership of the 78-year-old brand from San Francisco-based private equity firm Golden Gate Capital. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nBob Evans operates more than 400 restaurants in 18 states and employs more than 15,000 people. The company is based in New Albany and traces its roots to a 12-stool diner opened in 1948 by founder Bob Evans in Gallipolis, Ohio.\n\nDublin keeps Irish Festival ticket prices unchanged for 2026\n\n“We are proud of what we accomplished in partnership with Golden Gate Capital and excited to begin this next chapter with 4×4’s hands-on partnership,” said Mickey Mills, the restaurant chain’s CEO, who will continue to lead the brand. “Together, we look forward to investing in and enhancing our operations, guest experience, and brand.”\n\nGolden Gate Capital purchased Bob Evans in 2017 for $565 million. At the time, the firm split the restaurants from Bob Evans Farms, the brand’s consumer-packaged good business, which was acquired by Post Holdings for $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2022, Golden Gate explored a potential $600 million sale of the restaurant chain, though a transaction did not materialize. Reports in 2024 indicated the company had hired investment bank Kroll to oversee another sale process.\n\n“We are truly grateful to the terrific team at Bob Evans for their strong stewardship of this iconic brand,” said Neale Attenborough, a managing director at Golden Gate. “We wish the team all the best as they enter their next phase of growth.”\n\n‘Love is Blind’ fans buzzing over central Ohio ties\n\nBob Evans boasts itself as a farm-inspired, family-style restaurant brand known for breakfast offerings, such as its Farmer’s Choice Breakfast, and roasted turkey dinners.\n\n4×4 Capital, founded in 2018, focuses on investing in middle-market consumer goods and services companies across North America. The firm said it takes an active ownership approach aimed at accelerating growth and operational performance.\n\n“What truly sets the Bob Evans brand apart is its distinctive hospitality, welcoming ambiance, and fresh, flavorful food — delivering real value for the whole family,” said Gustavo Assumpção, co-founder and partner at 4×4 Capital, who will serve as executive board chair. “We look forward to partnering with Mickey and the team to maximize long-term growth.”",

    "fullText": "New York Jets fans have come to terms with the fact that Sam Darnold was better off elsewhere. The former No. 3 overall selection has done a fantastic job reviving his career since leaving the Jets. All of Darnold's hard work culminated in winning Super Bowl LX with the Seattle Seahawks this past weekend.\n\nDarnold has kept it classy at every turn when discussing his tumultuous tenure with the Jets during Super Bowl media week. The Seahawks held their Super Bowl 60-winning parade in downtown Seattle on Wednesday. As per usual, Darnold was faced with occasional questions about the Jets in the wake of winning his first Lombardi Trophy.\n\nOne particular question and clip has rightfully gone viral. Justin Fried of The Jet Press asked Darnold if he had a message to Jets fans who have continued to support him despite things not working out between player and franchise. Darnold provided the most heartwarming response imaginable.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Darnold started with. “I always look at myself and feel like I could’ve done a lot more for that franchise. The fact that [Jets fans] are able to support me even through that means a lot.”\n\nCongratulations to Darnold on winning Super Bowl LX!\n\nI asked Sam Darnold if he had a message to #Jets fans who have continued to support him:\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“I always look at myself and feel like I could’ve done a lot more for that franchise.”\n\n“The fact that [Jets fans] are able to support me even through that means a lot.” pic.twitter.com/AtOsbghHJN\n\n— Justin Fried (@JustinTFried) February 10, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Sam Darnold had the most heartwarming message for Jets fans",

    "description": "A New York City parent explains why she paid $7,500 for a part-time toddler program to ease separation anxiety before 3-K. She says it was worth it.",
    "fullText": "When I first found out I was pregnant, I frankly didn't put much thought into long-term childcare plans. Living in New York City, my husband and I knew we wouldn't have the traditional village available to us — my parents, while local and thrilled to get a first grandchild, are older and weren't particularly eager to volunteer for solo babysitting, while his parents live thousands of miles away.\n\nBut we were in a uniquely lucky situation: We both happened to have flexible, largely remote jobs.\n\nFor the first few months of my surprisingly generous parental leave, my husband and I, cocooned in newborn bliss (and perhaps slightly delirious from sleep deprivation), didn't stress about what would happen when I went back to work. I figured we could make it work through a combination of creative time management and strategically scheduled naps — at least until our daughter was eligible for 3-K, free schooling available in New York City for kids the year they turn 3.\n\nSurprisingly, this plan ended up working, for the most part, and for just shy of a year, we managed a fairly even 50-50 split in parenting duties. As time went on and my own work ramped up and the baby potato turned into a sprinting toddler, it became clear that my husband would need to become the primary parent.\n\nIt wasn't something either of us had considered before having a child, but it made the most sense: He found far greater fulfillment in being a father than he'd ever found in his career, whereas I had always defined myself by my work as a writer and editor. He kept his job but scaled back, working largely in the evenings and weekends so he could be free during the day for stay-at-home parenting.\n\nAs our daughter became a toddler, she blossomed under my husband's full-time care, with constant adventuring and frequent playdates keeping her days busy. We didn't need outside childcare — but as it turned out, she did.\n\nNew York City has notoriously high childcare costs.\n\nIn the interim between our delicate balancing act and deciding my husband would drastically scale down his work, I considered a number of different options, from traditional daycares (upward of $2,500 a month in my neighborhood for full-time programs) to nanny-share arrangements with other local families (maybe slightly cheaper, but a pain to coordinate).\n\nWe were lucky in that we were able to avoid childcare costs, which would have effectively canceled out one of our salaries, though I still toyed with the idea of enrolling her somewhere part time to get her used to the idea in case our situation changed.\n\nEnter Barnard College's Center for Toddler Development.\n\nI first heard about the program in a local moms' book club I'd joined. One of our first reads was \"How Toddlers Thrive\" by Tovah P. Klein, a prominent child psychologist — and incidentally the then-director of the Toddler Center. Another mom in the book club with a daughter two years older than mine mentioned she was now applying.\n\nI was frankly flabbergasted when she explained the details. It's part research program, where the toddlers are minded by teachers and selected students from the college's graduate program and observed for published research purposes from behind a one-way mirror, and part \"school,\" albeit an extremely part-time one, with each \"class\" of toddlers meeting only twice a week for two hours each day for the duration of the school year.\n\nI was intrigued by the program's unique \"gentle separation period\" and its said mission to help toddlers have a positive first school experience while supporting healthy social and emotional development through hands-on, child-guided play.\n\nAt that point, my daughter was only 18 months old (the halfway point to our 3-K end goal), but I'd already started to suspect that separation might be an eventual issue. With two working-from-home parents, she was used to having us around constantly — and had never had a babysitter.\n\nThe few times we'd tried to step out to grab a coffee and handed her to a grandparent, she would shriek like she was being abandoned. Over the next several months, she also grew more shy, coinciding with her stranger danger peaking.\n\nConvinced our future would be filled with school refusals and drop-off meltdowns, I hardcore pitched the Toddler Center to my husband for the coming school year. We didn't need it for childcare, but I became convinced we did need it to help give our daughter the gentlest, most gradual introduction to being away from us. He was less convinced, sure she would grow out of it and be OK with separating by 3-K, but agreed in the end.\n\nIf the program details were mind-boggling, the price point was eye-watering. Though there isn't a set, publicly announced tuition rate, the Toddler Center offers sliding-scale tuition and payment plans to make the program accessible to a broader range of the population. According to its website, a third of Toddler Center families pay tuition on a sliding scale (I assume the higher-profile alum parents like Amy Schumer, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Robert De Niro paid full sticker price for their kids to attend).\n\nAfter submitting a sliding-scale tuition application, which required forking over the previous year's tax returns to prove we were indeed not flush with cash, we landed on $7,500 as the final figure for our almost 2-year-old to take her first baby steps toward school.\n\nThe first few weeks of the program allowed the parents in the classroom, gradually moving us farther from it (a separate, no-toys-allowed room in the back, meant to be unappealing to the kids) to encourage the toddlers to ignore them and play in the main classroom area. That trick didn't work on our daughter, who simply sat next to the chair of whichever of us had taken her in that day, chattering happily as we tried to gently encourage her to go away.\n\nAs I'd dreaded, the initial actual separation — when parents would bring their kids into the classroom and tell them they were leaving — was horrendous. The Toddler Center mandated that only one parent or caregiver drop off their child each morning.\n\nFor the first few weeks after separation, we could both sit in the observation room, where we were treated to a front-row show of our daughter sobbing hysterically and trying to reason with the grad students to open the door she was convinced we were right behind. It was excruciating, and plenty of tears were shed on our end as well.\n\nThere was virtually no improvement for months, which was far longer than I expected. And I felt an immense amount of guilt for having come up with this idea in the first place: Were we actually traumatizing her instead of helping her? Had I epically miscalculated this? Did I pay $7,500 to torture my toddler and myself?\n\nI was wracked with doubt, and we debated withdrawing her from the program before the first semester had even finished. It was particularly hard on my husband, who, as the primary parent, was typically the one dropping her off and dealing with the meltdowns — and who also really missed her on school days.\n\nSuddenly, though, and for no particular reason at all, it got better. A lot better.\n\nInstead of sobbing by the door for a full hour and a half, she started interacting with the other kids. She found a favorite grad student she'd attach herself to. She played happily on the classroom slide. And eventually, she comforted the other toddlers during their hard separation days, assuring them their mommies or daddies would be back.\n\nWhile it was difficult for my husband to be apart from his little buddy for the few hours a week she was at the program, they turned it into an opportunity for new adventures. In the spring semester, he began biking with her to school, stopping to pick up flowers on the way there and back. Another tradition became that he would bring her a blueberry muffin from a local café every day at pickup. These small rituals helped them bond even more.\n\nI don't pretend to have a handle on the intricacies of toddler psychology, and I can't tell you what the flipped-switch moment was where it finally clicked for my kid that being left at school with her teachers didn't mean we were gone forever. And yes, for the record, she still cried during drop-off the first few weeks of 3-K.\n\nBut I am convinced that completing the Toddler Center program drastically reduced her adjustment period for \"real school.\" Tossing her into the deep end for six hours a day, five days a week, was simply not the right option for our family.\n\nIn the end, I'm glad I listened to my gut, dug into our pockets, and toughed out the tears — and I'd like to think my daughter, somewhere deep down in her toddler brain, is too.",

    "fullText": "There was a time I thought I'd spend the rest of my life in New York.\n\nAfter more than a decade in Manhattan, the streets felt like my own, and my identity felt entwined with the city.\n\nEven after having two babies on the Upper West Side, I was constantly plotting and planning on how we could make this lifestyle work long-term.\n\nAnd then, my husband and I stumbled upon our dream home in a distant Connecticut suburb.\n\nI was four months postpartum with my second son, and with two kids, I was no longer able to get the stroller down the three sets of stairs to get out of our building myself.\n\nThough I loved that my routine included walks in Central Park and my oldest had learned to ride a scooter along the Hudson River, I couldn't deny the appeal of a real backyard and a kitchen with an adult-sized fridge.\n\nThere were days when I swore I could feel the walls of our 750-square-foot apartment caving in, but could we really make the move to the 'burbs?\n\nWe both worked full time — I as a journalist, and my husband in finance. Even though our jobs only required us to be in the office two or three times a week, the distance was still daunting, and commutes would be at least an hour each way.\n\nPlus, what would it mean to remove ourselves from the city's vibrant energy? Would we lose ourselves?\n\nStill a little unsure, we decided it was an opportunity we couldn't pass up. On my second son's first day of day care, I dropped him off with teary eyes, and we drove an hour north to close on a four-bedroom home.\n\nWe gained more than three times the physical space of our apartment in the move, but the real gain was the mental space that opened up.\n\nOur day-care bill was almost halved. My kids traded in Riverside Park for their own driveway and a quiet street where they learned to ride bikes.\n\nI was no longer in a constant state of figuring out logistics or trying to find affordable ways for us to get out. We could invite people over to our house, we could barbecue in our backyard, we could even walk 20 minutes to the beach … for free.\n\nEven though we offset our day-care savings with our new mortgage, life felt undeniably more accessible.\n\nI felt myself start to breathe a little easier. I stopped constantly focusing on how to make more money and advance my career. For the first time in my adult life, everything we had was enough.\n\nThat same settled feeling that brought me peace in the suburbs also felt like a little bit of a loss.\n\nThere's a sense of anticipation in every conversation I had with friends in New York — anticipation for a shoot to wrap, for the perfect apartment to appear, for a deal to close.\n\nIt is a feeling built on ambition, dreams, and the shared experience of sacrificing a little bit of life's comforts to be a part of something bigger than yourself. That feeling lit me up when we were in the city, and connected me to my most creative self.\n\nLeaving the city meant we could no longer catch a last-minute Broadway show or easily see the latest exhibit at the Met. We had to consider job opportunities in a whole new way, and as a journalist, that meant accepting that I couldn't pursue certain roles that would require odd hours in the office anymore.\n\nHowever, most of all, I have missed the sense of belonging I felt before the move.\n\nOn the Upper West Side, I had enjoyed a spirit of communal parenting with my neighbors. No matter the weather or time of year, we were always out at a museum or a playground, meeting up with other families.\n\nWhen you live in such tiny spaces, your kids celebrate milestones at restaurants and rented spaces. You're all in it together.\n\nIn the suburbs, once the temperatures dropped, I felt everyone around me burrow into their homes and didn't see them again until spring. It's hard to make new connections when families aren't gathering at the beaches and playgrounds for large swaths of the year.\n\nWith more space came a greater distance from my peers, which made building a new community feel out of reach.\n\nThe energy of New York was the thing I loved most about it. It was also what exhausted me. Once we had kids, the life I wanted felt too far out of reach. The cost of living, too much.\n\nWith a move to the suburbs, our quality of life improved, and the air still feels more breathable.\n\nThe downsides are real — the commute is long, the proximity to our creative fields feels far, and I have struggled to find my community in a place that has felt more isolating than NYC.\n\nHowever, the tradeoffs are just as real. With more space came more peace, more stability, and more financial opportunity.\n\nWe lost some things in the move, but we didn't lose ourselves. And I like to think we brought a little bit of that New York spark with us.",

    "description": "The Minnesota Vikings traded defensive tackle Harrison Phillips to the New York Jets last summer, a shocking transaction because fans […]",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings traded defensive tackle Harrison Phillips to the New York Jets last summer, a shocking transaction because fans believed the team held Phillips in the highest regard. And when Phillips arrived in New York, he quickly realized the grass wasn’t greener on the other side.\n\nPhillips’ comments put the Vikings’ former captain back in the spotlight and raise questions about the Jets’ tone.\n\nThe veteran lineman told all this week, sparing his head coach, Aaron Glenn, from criticism but noting a markedly different atmosphere from his time in Minnesota and Buffalo.\n\nIt’s a story of the Jets being “the Jets.”\n\nPhillips spoke to Roundtable Sports on Radio Row last week, and he wasn’t shy about revealing the truth.\n\nHe said about his employer, “I think Aaron Glenn inherited a very cancerous, truculent group — whole, top to bottom. It’s not individual people’s fault. I was there for one season — it was a very difficult season — and I almost wanted to waver on some of my thoughts and my beliefs and my optimism.”\n\n“So, I can’t imagine being there for year after year after year after year and not seeing the results that you wanted, and it tainted people. Because my coach is going to get fired, my teammate’s going to get fired, I’m going to be a free agent, I might get fired, I have to play for me, I have to make sure my tape is hot regardless of what the system is asking me to do, what the scheme is telling me to do.”\n\nMany Jets fans saw the interview and thought, “Sounds about right.”\n\nPhillips added, “Then, young players come in and see, ‘Oh, that’s my vet, that’s how they’re acting, so that’s the way I’m going to act, too.’ It’s a long chain of things, and it can’t be fixed like that.”\n\n“I think AG’s mindset, of any coach I’ve been around, to deal with what we had to deal with this season and be as consistent as he was to us throughout that whole thing, was super cool to see,”\n\nUnless he’s released, Phillips can’t quite get out of New York; he’s scheduled to be a free agent in 2027.\n\nOn August 20th, ESPN’s Adam Schefter tweeted: “ESPN sources: Vikings are trading DT Harrison Phillips and a 2027 7th-round pick to the New York Jets in exchange for a 2026 6th-round pick and a 2027 6th-round pick, pending Phillips’ physical. Phillips now joins Jowon Briggs as the second DT that the Jets traded for Wednesday.”\n\nFans checked to ensure the tweet wasn’t from a parody account because — why would Minnesota trade Phillips?\n\nThe defense wound up ranking third in the NFL in EPA per play, so losing Phillips wasn’t a death sentence, but there were times throughout the 2025 campaign when Phillips’s run defense would’ve come in handy. Now, for their troubles, the Vikings will get a pair of extra 6th-Round picks, which, for all intents and purposes, nobody really cares about.\n\nIn the Twin Cities, Phillips earned respect as a team captain and tone-setter. He justified his contract by providing stability at defensive tackle when the Vikings struggled with inconsistency at the position. He steadied the middle of the defensive line when it sometimes faltered.\n\nOff the field, he became the organization’s most visible humanitarian, consistently investing time and resources into community work. Over 51 games in Minnesota, the 29-year-old recorded 207 tackles, 17 quarterback hits, and 6.5 sacks, also serving as a cultural pillar in the locker room.\n\nPhillips personally played well in New York last season — go figure — but his team stunk. Utterly stunk. The Jets started 0-7, basically eliminating themselves from postseason contention by Halloween, and finished the campaign with a horrid 3-14 record.\n\nIn recent weeks, Glenn has fired almost all of his coaching staff, so whatever culture he hoped to fix per the cancerous Phillips observation will start from scratch in 2026.\n\nPhillips banked a 72.5 grade from Pro Football Focus. He did his part. It’s also worth noting that Phillips, until 2025, spent his entire career with the Bills and Vikings. Playing for a bottom-feeder was new territory — that he evidently didn’t enjoy.\n\nWhat’s Next for Phillips & the Jets?\n\nPhillips can escape from New York next offseason, and he’ll be 31 when it’s time to sign his next contract. Unless the Jets trade him in the upcoming months, he’s stuck contractually.\n\nFor the Jets’ overall outlook, well, they’re in a familiar spot. They need a quarterback. Justin Fields and Tyrod Taylor held down the fort in 2025, but all that led to was a 3-14 record. In the coming weeks and months, New York can pursue a passer via trade like Mac Jones or Kyler Murray, sign Malik Willis from free agency, or explore the draft for a signal-caller like Ty Simpson, Carson Beck, or Trinidad Chambliss.\n\nNew York has the third-lowest Super Bowl odds for next year, with a +20000 moneyline, only besting the Miami Dolphins and Arizona Cardinals.",

    "description": "The New York Times argued that it was \"time to acknowledge reality\" and \"admit\" that the United States has a \"marijuana problem\" in a new editorial.",
    "fullText": "The New York Times argued that it was “time to acknowledge reality” and “admit” that the United States has a “marijuana problem” in a new editorial admitting that the legalization of weed in most states has had a wide variety of adverse consequences.\n\n“This editorial board has long supported marijuana legalization. In 2014, we published a six-part series that compared the federal marijuana ban to alcohol prohibition and argued for repeal. Much of what we wrote then holds up — but not all of it does,” began the Times. “At the time, supporters of legalization predicted that it would bring few downsides. In our editorials, we described marijuana addiction and dependence as ‘relatively minor problems.’ Many advocates went further and claimed that marijuana was a harmless drug that might even bring net health benefits. They also said that legalization might not lead to greater use.”\n\n“It is now clear that many of these predictions were wrong. Legalization has led to much more use. Surveys suggest that about 18 million people in the United States have used marijuana almost daily (or about five times a week) in recent years. That was up from around six million in 2012 and less than one million in 1992. More Americans now use marijuana daily than alcohol,” it acknowledged. “This wider use has caused a rise in addiction and other problems. Each year, nearly 2.8 million people in the United States suffer from cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, which causes severe vomiting and stomach pain. More people have also ended up in hospitals with marijuana-linked paranoia and chronic psychotic disorders. Bystanders have also been hurt, including by people driving under the influence of pot.”\n\nInstead of calling for a total rollback that would recriminalize the sale and use of the drug, the Gray Lady advocated a policy of “grudging toleration” that might upset “Big Weed,” which, it argues has “a financial incentive to mislead the public about what they are selling.”\n\n“Marijuana companies, not casual smokers, are the biggest winners of Mr. Trump’s decision to reclassify the drug from Schedule I to Schedule III. The change will increase the profits of these businesses by causing the tax code to treat them more favorably. This does not qualify as grudging toleration,” it submitted before concluding: “The unfortunate truth is that the loosening of marijuana policies — especially the decision to legalize pot without adequately regulating it — has led to worse outcomes than many Americans expected. It is time to acknowledge reality and change course.”\n\nThe post ‘Time to Acknowledge Reality’: The New York Times Warns America Has a ‘Marijuana Problem’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns have requested permission to interview New York Giants outside linebackers coach Charlie Bullen for their vacant defensive coordinator position, reports NFL Network's Mike Garafolo.\n\nBullen, who joined the Giants in 2024 as outside linebackers coach, stepped into the interim defensive coordinator role after Shane Bowen's midseason firing under then-interim head coach Mike Kafka.\n\nIn his brief tenure during the final games, Bullen revitalized a struggling Giants defense, shifting to a more aggressive scheme that generated consistent pressure, mixed coverages effectively, and unlocked the potential of rookies like linebacker Abdul Carter alongside stars Brian Burns and Dexter Lawrence. The unit returned to playing up to traditional Giants standards, earning praise for its improved performance despite limited wins.\n\nBullen described serving as DC as a \"great honor and privilege,\" focusing on hard work and player development rather than external validation. His success drew widespread interest, including prior interview requests from the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals.\n\nUnder new Giants head coach John Harbaugh, Bullen was retained on staff -- amid a broader coaching purge -- but primarily as outside linebackers coach.\n\nTeams cannot block promotional interviews, positioning Bullen as a rising candidate for full-time coordinator opportunities.

    "description": "A super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and other tech leaders has targeted New York Assembly member Alex Bores' congressional campaign, marking its first attack against a lawmaker supporting AI regulation.",
    "fullText": "A pro-AI super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman has chosen New York Assembly member Alex Bores — and his congressional bid — as its first target.\n\nThe PAC, dubbed Leading the Future, formed in August with a more than $100 million commitment to support policymakers with a light-touch — or a no-touch — approach to AI regulation. And that means going after policymakers who want to regulate AI. The super PAC has backing from a number of other prominent leaders in tech, including Palantir co-founder and 8VC managing partner Joe Lonsdale as well as AI search engine Perplexity.\n\n“I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it,” Bores told a room of journalists Monday evening at a Journalism Workshop on AGI impacts and governance in Washington, D.C. “When they say, ‘Hey, we’re going to spend millions against Alex because he might regulate Big Tech and put basic guardrails on AI,’ I just basically forward that to my constituents.”\n\nBores, who’s running to represent the state’s 12th Congressional District, said AI anxieties are on the rise among his constituents, who worry about everything from data centers pushing up utility bills and worsening climate change to chatbots impacting kids’ mental health and automation transforming the job market.\n\nBores is the chief sponsor of New York’s bipartisan RAISE Act, which requires large AI labs to have a safety plan in place to prevent critical harms, follow their own safety plan, and disclose critical safety incidents, like bad actors stealing an AI model. The bill also prohibits AI firms from releasing models with unreasonable risks of critical harm and imposes civil penalties of up to $30 million if companies fail to live up to these standards. The legislation is currently awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature.\n\nBores said while drafting and redrafting the bill, he consulted with the large AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. Those negotiations led to the removal of provisions like third-party safety audits, which he says the industry refused to accept. Nevertheless, the RAISE Act, and Bores himself, appears to have incurred the ire of Silicon Valley.\n\nZac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, heads of Leading the Future, told Politico that they would work on a multibillion-dollar effort to sink Bores’ campaign.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch, they accused Bores of advancing “ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation.” The pair said “bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.”\n\n“The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,” Moffatt and Vlasto said in the emailed statement. “America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users.”\n\nMany in Silicon Valley have pushed to prohibit states from passing regulation that relates to AI. Earlier this year, a provision blocking state AI laws was slipped into the federal budget bill and was later removed. Now, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz are seeking to resurrect it through other legislative avenues.\n\nBores said he is concerned such a movement could continue to gain legs at a time when the federal government has passed no meaningful AI regulation. Where federal government moves slow, states are like startups — they can function as policy laboratories and move fast to test what works.\n\n“The question should be, has Congress solved the problem?” Bores said. “If Congress solves the problem, then it can tell the states to get out of the way, but if they’re not going to pass a bill that’s actually addressing any of the problems…and then [saying that states can’t do anything] that just doesn’t make sense to me.”\n\nBores also noted he has been in contact with policymakers in other states to work on standardizing legislation, which could combat Silicon Valley’s “patchwork” objection. He also believes that lawmakers should ensure there are no redundancies with the EU AI Act.\n\nBores emphasized that AI regulation isn’t meant to limit innovation, and that he has rejected bills that he thinks would have unintended consequences for the industry.\n\n“Having basic rules of the road, literal or metaphorical, is actually a very pro-innovation stance if done well,” Bores said. “I fundamentally believe that the AI that wins is going to be the AI that is trustworthy. And the pushback from industry to say that government has no role in establishing that trust is one that I think you’re seeing people reject at every level.”",

    "fullText": "Black and trans drag performers are crowdfunding to survive in one of the most expensive cities in the world.\n\nAfter he somersaults on the bar in six-inch stilettos and a blood-stained, Chucky’s-bride-themed white corset, the crowd at Bushwick’s queer-owned Pink Metal Bar roars in delight for Xaddy Addy, a Black transmasculine drag king and sideshow performer. The audience has gathered in the intimate bar for Superstar Open Set’s Halloween show, an open stage that Xaddy Addy cohosts each week alongside drag performer Pachacvnti. After a night of performances from Brooklyn’s emerging talent, the crowd remains spellbound as Xaddy Addy staples cash tips to his cheeks, thighs, and hips. Not even the loud cheering drowns out the clack of the staple gun as it pierces his skin. His self-assured, “weird” drag performance—an expansive genre melding drag with horror, stunts, and complex dramaturgy—belies the economic insecurity and discrimination he faced while building a following.\n\nManhattan native Xaddy Addy tells me that drag was “a way to save his life” after years of doing sex work “100 percent out of survival.” For many, drag is both a calling and an art form—one that contributes to New York’s $35 billion nightlife economy. But income from their performances barely covers their bills in one of the most expensive cities in the world, where the average rent soars beyond $3,000. Many Black and trans performers are crowdfunding on social media to cover rent, medical bills, and groceries.\n\n“You have some of the best Black trans drag performers in the world in your city,” says Klondyke, a Black drag artist and sideshow performer. “Why are they starving? Why am I seeing more people that are Black and trans posting mutual aid than posting shows that they’re in?”\n\nWith the election of Mayor Zohran Mamdani, drag artists are hopeful about his promises to make the city more affordable, by freezing rent for stabilized housing, and to expand protections for trans New Yorkers. But they argue that policy changes alone will not be enough to undo decades of decisions that have disenfranchised the city’s marginalized residents. That will take all of us.\n\nDrag performance artists occupy a precarious ledge in New York’s gentrified landscape. The city’s exorbitant costs of living, along with Trump’s despotic policies, have caused residents and tourists to opt out of live entertainment. “I can’t tell you how many shows I’ve been a part of that have been well promoted, the promo’s gorgeous, the cast is posting, the tickets are not too expensive,” Bri Joy, a drag king and go-go dancer, says. “All the conditions are correct for a beautiful day at the beach, and then no one shows up at the beach.”\n\nBut Black and brown artists have faced decades of discrimination over the years, long before Donald Trump kicked off his crusade against trans people. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Afrosephone, a showgirl from New York, remembers, “the girls and the dolls went to work” across swaths of Manhattan—from the West Side Piers to the iconic La Escuelita on West 39th Street. By contrast, white venues permitted Black or Latine people only on designated nights. These clubs “were a thousand times worse back then,” Afrosephone says, “where they could be openly racist to you.” Black and brown artists forged their own spaces underground, and their contributions to nightlife attracted tourists, a new generation of queer transplants, and, inevitably, the cops.\n\nIn response to the proliferation of underground clubbing, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani disproportionately raided Black and brown clubs for dancing, smoking, or playing loud music. He also wiped the dust off the Prohibition-era Cabaret Law, which outlaws dancing in venues without a pricey cabaret license. Giuliani’s policies, ostensibly aimed to reduce crime, sought to attract wealthy transplants and business owners to the city. Mayor Mike Bloomberg continued these draconian measures into the early 2010s. A long battle with the NY State Liquor Authority ended in La Escuelita’s untimely closing in 2016, only a year before Mayor Bill de Blasio finally repealed the Cabaret Law.\n\nThe NYPD’s crusade on Black and brown clubs robbed performers of cultural sanctuary and employment options. Real estate developers and culture-hungry newcomers flocked to pick at the ruins. Venue owners and event producers shut Black performers out of regimented clubs, where partygoers shuffled into VIP sections, hardly danced, and snapped photos of ostentatious bottle service. Today, Black and trans artists continue to face discriminatory hiring practices.\n\nBri Joy says that many promoters adhere to the “paper bag test”—if a drag performer’s skin is darker than a paper bag, then they’re turned away from certain clubs. Trans artists face compounded scrutiny from audiences and other drag performers, who have asked Bri Joy probing questions like “What kind of trans are you?” and outed Afrosephone on stage without her consent.\n\n“Even now, especially in Manhattan, there can only be one or two top Black performers at a time,” Afrosephone says. “We’re at the mercy of these establishments that don’t truly want to work with us.”\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio’s relatively progressive policy decisions led to ephemeral gains for drag artists. Along with expanding labor rights and housing protections, de Blasio founded the Office of Nightlife (ONL) to support workers and local business development after dark.\n\nWhen Covid restrictions were lifted in 2021, Klondyke recalls that “a lot of corporate and white money” was being “thrown at drag” programs. Diverse drag lineups attracted audiences who toted stimulus checks and a nascent, if not fleeting, solidarity with people of color after the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020. “I was doing at least three or four shows a week for over a year, and that was able to sustain me,” Klondyke says. “Then it just starts to fizzle.” Once the news cycle closed the chapter on racial justice, so did the city’s doors and wallets.\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Michael Kazin\n\nEric Adams pledged to revive the nightlife economy when he was elected mayor in 2022. During his term, he frequently appeared at swanky Midtown venues where he dined on branzino with his inner circle, including convicted fraudsters and former Governor Andrew Cuomo—whose tenure saw steep increases in housing costs and a decline in the number of Black residents.\n\nThe New York City Council sued Adams for blocking legislation to offer more housing vouchers and recently overruled his proposal to hike Section 8 rents. His $650 million campaign to combat street homelessness raises questions about the plan’s execution, given that his former policies led to increased policing in subway stations and forced displacements of unhoused people.\n\nAdams, to his credit, led the transition from Giuliani’s authoritarian MARCH program, in which police cracked down on clubs without warning, to CURE, an initiative that mediates nightlife violations before resorting to harsh police enforcement. While these measures bridge the gap between city government and nightlife venues, Adams’ administration failed to meaningfully address the most pertinent threats to nightlife workers: housing insecurity and finding safe, steady work.\n\n“There have been one or two times where I’ve had a bout of unemployment and I’ve tried to make it work with just nightlife,” says Bri Joy. “I owed so much back rent and I was the brokest I’d ever been in my life. It was the first time that I’d really seen my account hit actual zero.”\n\nEven New York’s “Freelance Isn’t Free” law, which protects freelancers’ rights, requires written contracts only for projects of $800 or more with a single employer. But underground drag artists often earn up to a couple hundred dollars from gigs, if they’re paid at all, and recurring bookings are difficult to come by. In August 2024, the ONL reported that its efforts to expand affordability for DIY spaces were “currently on hold”—despite the fact that increased access to venues would help drag performers and producers like Vague Static create more employment opportunities.\n\n“It’s gonna be a lot easier a lot of the time for a white producer to get into the clubs, to produce a thing, and pay the people,” says Vague Static. They are a co-organizer of Lil’ Park Drag Show, a free program that took a hiatus this year following a spike in transphobic safety threats. “I do not have the money to pay the people for their time.”\n\nA 2019 ONL study reports that income stability and gig competition pose substantial hurdles to 80 percent of nightlife entertainers, and drag is especially cutthroat. Individualism, prejudice, and poor conflict resolution within the drag community—even among other LGBTQ+ people of color—widen the gaps of public policy failures.\n\nDrag kings in particular are disregarded and underpaid compared to drag queens and well-known entertainers, who use “words like community and friendship to get close to you,” only to disappear when they find “a better booking,” according to Klondyke. These discrepancies have material consequences. In January, after Klondyke failed to secure consistent work and accumulated $10,000 in unpaid rent, his landlord evicted him and his partner from their Brooklyn apartment. “Our income is very sporadic,” reads Klondyke’s fundraiser for housing costs. “We are at the end of our rope.” Although Klondyke began fundraising in 2024, his campaign is still less than halfway to its goal, and his search for secure housing wears on.\n\n“When you become silent, you fall into the similar categories of the rising conservatism that we see in this country,” Xaddy Addy says. “People are left to feel alone and invisible and think to themselves, what does it even mean to be in these spaces? What does it even mean to exist in this life?”\n\nFor as long as Black trans artists have existed in New York City, they have addressed their uncertain living situations with community-based solutions. In 1968, drag queen Crystal LaBeija created the House of LaBeija—an artist-led collective that offered mentorship and support networks to Black trans talent—to resist the racial discrimination she faced in ballroom pageants, where women of color lightened their faces to compete for white judges only to lose to non-Black talent. LaBeija’s house system was the first of its kind, not only launching drag to international acclaim but offering a blueprint for how drag artists can support each other in moments of need. “There would be no ballroom or drag culture without Crystal LaBeija,” says Afrosephone.\n\nDuring the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, performers relied on drag collectives, where drag artists shared costumes, exchanged industry knowledge, and hosted in-person events like “Takes the Cake,” “a drag competition for drag king, things, and other non-binary & queer performers.” Klondyke, who “came up in the time of collectives” and won Takes the Cake in 2021, recalls the electrifying presence these opportunities carried, “especially for kings and things,” who were “excited to have spaces to do our thing.”\n\nThe Cake Boys, the drag collective behind Takes the Cake, had to shutter their live event programming in 2024, but other underground initiatives have sprouted up to fulfill drag artists’ needs. More recently, Klondyke and Xaddy Addy cofounded Black Cherry Sideshow, the first-ever trans and BIPOC-led drag sideshow, alongside drag artists Selena Surreal and Oliver Herface. The quartet performs every second Saturday of the month at Purgatory Bar in Bushwick, where they engage in a dizzying range of stunts like eating fire, lying on beds of nails, and taking needles and mouse traps to their bare flesh. With an historic one-year anniversary event held last May on Coney Island, Black Cherry Sideshow dares to reimagine the sideshow not as an exploitative spectacle for white consumption but a way for trans performers of color to reclaim their power and, according to Xaddy Addy, “raise the stakes in my drag in a dangerous but safe way.” Along with his sideshow grind, both Xaddy Addy and Afrosephone host open sets to uplift up-and-coming drag artists, while others circulate calls for mutual aid.\n\n“Being a drag performer, I’d much rather [use] art to fight through a fascist system instead of making art to appease a fascist system,” Klondyke says. “The fact that my art is able to exist as a Black trans person is what is political.”\n\nDrag is inextricable from the city’s anti-fascist future. Zohran Mamdani’s use of relationship-building, volunteerism, and media to build power mirrors the tactics of Black and trans-led collectives throughout New York’s history.\n\nSo far, Mamdani has acted on some of his campaign promises and fallen short on others. Although Mamdani called to defund the “racist and anti-queer” NYPD on X in 2020, he roused criticism from progressives after choosing to retain Jessica Tisch, a moderate who increased surveillance across the city and opposes bail reform efforts, as the NYPD commissioner. The decision to maintain Eric Adams’s pro-NYPD appointment, along with his delayed, lackluster response to two fatal police shootings days into his term, cast suspicion over whether he’ll follow through on his pledge to protect New Yorkers who are most vulnerable to police violence.\n\nHe has made more hopeful strides in the realm of nightlife and entertainment, where he elected Freelancers Union leader Rafael Espinal as commissioner of the New York City Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment. Espinal led the charge to repeal the Cabaret Law and pass the Freelance Isn’t Free Act as a city councillor under Bill de Blasio. The native Brooklynite’s track record of inclusive policy reforms, along with his recent promises to expand affordability for NYC creatives, seek to meaningfully address the cost-of-living catastrophe that worsened under Adams’ administration.\n\nYet policy changes alone are never enough. True power, as Mamdani even emphasized on his campaign trail, lies in the hands of the people.\n\nNew Yorkers have a responsibility to show up and stand down for nightlife performers by attending drag shows run by Black trans performers, tipping and paying entertainers living wages, and advocating for inclusive hiring practices.\n\n“You shouldn’t wait until somebody is on Drag Race to show your support,” says Afrosephone. “The one thing that will keep us performing, the one thing that will keep us afloat, is if you show up.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "description": "Former Real Housewives of New York star Bethenny Frankel moved to Florida last year. She's in her 'nightgown era' and is building a dating community.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 55-year-old Bethenny Frankel, former star of The Real Housewives of New York City and founder of The Core, a private dating membership community. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have a much bigger business now than when I was on The Real Housewives of New York City, was running Skinnygirl, my lifestyle brand famous for its low-calorie cocktails, and landed on the cover of Forbes.\n\nI got a big one-time check when I sold the liquor arm of Skinnygirl, but what I'm doing now, through The Core, my private dating membership community, influencing, and investing, is bigger than ever.\n\nI'm busy, but I'm not sitting at a desk every day. My brain works well, I have a phone, and that's really all I need. I wrote most of my New York Times bestselling books on a BlackBerry.\n\nHere's a typical day in my life.\n\nI wake up fairly early. I let the dogs out, then go give my daughter a hug and a kiss if she lets me in her room for a second. I really love that. I tend to troll her by sitting on her bed for a few minutes, but I've learned that teens don't like to talk in the morning.\n\nI make myself a strong iced coffee with my Cumulus coffee maker and feed the dogs. My dogs are really important to me, and I try to get as many good snuggles in with them as I can.\n\nBetween 7:30 and 8:30 a.m., I usually go for a walk on the beach. I moved from New York to South Florida in March 2025, and I love wandering around like a weirdo on the beach. I often finish the walks by jumping into the sea.\n\nI like taking calls while walking on the beach. In the morning, these are usually with one team member handling brand partnerships and appearances, and with my COO, where we discuss bigger deals, contract negotiations, and my investments.\n\nSince we launched The Core in December, it's taken up a big part of my day. It brings together the trust I've built as an entrepreneur with my crazy Rolodex of incredibly powerful and successful people.\n\nI'm passionate about it, and passion is my thing. When I start obsessing over something — it was the same with BStrong, my disaster-relief initiative I launched in 2017 in response to that year's devastating hurricane season — it's the only thing I'm talking about.\n\nLike every other business I've run, it's a case of building the plane while flying it. A lot of the work involves responding to texts and voice-noting somebody, asking them to do something.\n\nIf someone wants to get on the phone with me, I'll often take the call while I'm in the car. Otherwise, that time is wasted, and I don't waste time, food, or money.\n\nMy days aren't tightly structured, and I don't like feeling shackled by having too many things I have to do. The day often gets away from me before I've even showered, and my team will remind me that I have 15 minutes until I need to record my podcast, \"Just B with Bethenny Frankel.\"\n\nI record the episodes at home. Mostly, I don't care about having guests on. If I talk about my pillowcases and the bacterial facial infection I got on vacation, it will rate just as well as having Madonna.\n\nI'll usually rant for about an hour. I only like to sit and talk about what I want to talk about. It's almost like my own personal therapy monologue.\n\nThis year, I've been more open to meeting people for meals and coffee.\n\nOtherwise, I have my \"supermodel snacks\" for lunch, often seaweed stuffed with salad or turkey or rice cakes with avocado or cottage cheese.\n\nI don't plan to record my social media videos; it's mostly spontaneous. I don't post them as much as I used to. I've told my team I only want to put out excellent content, not filler.\n\nOften, my posts are just about something that's happened to me, and that leads companies to want to do brand deals. Once a week, I bang out those brand videos. The companies send the products to my home, and I film for two to three hours.\n\nI'm constantly being sent expensive things by major brands, from mattresses to nonalcoholic drinks to vape pipes. I also buy a lot of products to try myself. Once that stuff arrives, I want it out of my house as quickly as possible.\n\nAs a result, gift-giving has become a huge part of my day. If anyone does anything nice for me, whether it's at the nail salon or anywhere else, I want to give them a gift. I feel like the universe gave the \"get stuff\" crown to the right person: I like to share the wealth.\n\nIn the evenings, I try to protect my peace and avoid getting too activated by anything. I like to find a TV series that has thousands of episodes to work through. Right now, that's The Walking Dead, which I've been watching in my nightgown. I'm in my nightgown era. I also like to take a bath before I go to sleep.\n\nI listen to my body. I'm an efficient, very organized person, but I'm also a lounger, a pyjama-wearer, and a relaxer. I chill a decent amount each day.\n\nI also listen to my body for cues on when to eat or snack. I'll make dinner reservations, but often change them because I'm not hungry enough.\n\nI couldn't care less about traditional meal times.\n\nThe other night, I went to Trader Joe's and cooked a big dinner at home for my daughter, the guy I'm seeing, and a girlfriend. In Florida, I'm more sociable than I was in New York. I'm actually seeing other human life, outside of dating or being paid.\n\nWhat I cook often depends on what's already in the fridge. I enjoy the process of taking ingredients out, laying them out on the counter, and cooking.\n\nI also feel pride that my daughter sees that, even with how busy I am with my career, I'm able to do this really normal thing for her. That's meaningful for me.",

    "fullText": "Leaving Mexico City, the place I grew up, wasn't impulsive. It was calculated — shaped by ambition and the stubborn belief that opportunity still lives somewhere else.\n\nI headed to New York City in 2020, hoping to prove myself on what I thought was the world's biggest stage. I enrolled in law school, eager to work hard and prove myself.\n\nThe city would eventually demand everything from me, relentlessly, until my life was no longer about ambition but survival.\n\nI eventually left New York City two years later, learning a lot about ambition and the true cost of the American dream.\n\nI was born and raised in Mexico City. It was the only home I'd ever known, which made leaving both harder and more necessary than I expected. Mexico City gave me everything: a vibrant social life, deep friendships, culture that felt alive in every neighborhood, and food that made you want to stay at the table for hours. My days were rich with spontaneity. My nights felt endless in the best way.\n\nGrowing up there also meant learning to coexist with things that slowly wear you down. News alerts about violence became routine. Conversations casually referenced kidnappings the way others might discuss traffic. Certain neighborhoods, roads, or situations were simply off-limits. Everyone knew it, and no one questioned it.\n\nOver time, crime made my future feel fragile. When you're born somewhere, you learn to accept these things as normal. But that doesn't mean they don't accumulate. I didn't want to build a life that depended on constantly calculating risk.\n\nAt the same time, I felt pulled toward something else entirely. The American dream may be bruised and unevenly distributed, but it still exerts a gravitational force. New York represented access to industries, ambition, and reinvention. I wanted to test myself somewhere the ceiling felt higher, even if the floor was harder.\n\nI moved to Manhattan at the end of 2020. Despite the pandemic, my experience wasn't diminished. I watched the city come back to life at full speed.\n\nNew York was exactly as advertised: expensive, intense, chaotic, and unapologetically demanding. It rewarded momentum and punished hesitation. Everything required effort: finding housing, building community, maintaining balance.\n\nAt first, I embraced the intensity. I worked constantly, studied late into the night, stayed busy, and told myself exhaustion was proof I was doing something right. But New York normalizes extremes. Long hours become the baseline. Hustle becomes identity. Rest starts to feel indulgent.\n\nWhat made New York thrilling in the short term felt unsustainable when I imagined it as permanent. The social life, the hustle culture, the constant stimulation — all of it left little room for pause.\n\nStaying long-term meant accepting a life where I had to keep my foot on the gas pedal.\n\nNew York forced me to confront my relationship with ambition, productivity, and self-worth. It taught me discipline and precision. It also clarified my limits. I learned that opportunity without sustainability eventually becomes a trap, not a privilege.\n\nI understood exactly what the city offered: access, intensity, momentum. I also understood exactly what New York and the American dream demanded in return: everything.\n\nI knew then I didn't want to build a life that required me to be \"on\" constantly. I started prioritizing myself and my core convictions, love, relationships, and sustainability. That change would eventually take me out of New York City and into another global hub: London.",

    "fullText": "New York Giants linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux is embracing the arrival of new head coach John Harbaugh, praising his \"old-school\" coaching style as a much-needed reset for the team.\n\nDuring Super Bowl week in San Francisco, Thibodeaux made inquiries about Harbaugh, speaking with \"a few older guys\" who had played under him in Baltimore. The feedback reinforced Harbaugh's reputation as a strict, no-nonsense leader who \"knows football and he loves football.\"\n\nThibodeaux expressed enthusiasm for the straightforward approach.\n\n\"I always like when you pass a certain age, you don’t have to sugarcoat what you say, you’re just kinda straightforward, white and black,\" Thibodeaux said, via the New York Post. \"You see a lot of different cultures, different people that want to sometimes change their ways for the new generation or they want to fit in or whatever the case may be.\n\n\"For me, specifically, I like old-school coaches because they just take no (expletive), black and white, you know what you’re gonna get every day. I think with a lot of young guys that we have, I think it’s gonna be good for him to really get it in order.\"\n\nThis comes after an earlier denial in January, when Thibodeaux dismissed suggestions on social media that Giants players were calling around about Harbaugh, responding to team legend Carl Banks: \"Nobody's doing this, Carl. Effort was never the problem.\"\n\nHis recent comments show he has since actively sought insights into the coach hired to turn around the franchise following seasons of inconsistency.\n\nThibodeaux, who had his fifth-year option picked up, remains optimistic about the defense under new coordinator Dennard Wilson and is relieved that position coach Charlie Bullen was retained... For now.\n\nAfter a 2025 season cut short by injury, Thibodeaux is cleared medically and eager to thrive in Harbaugh's structured environment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Kayvon Thibodeaux loves John Harbaugh's 'old-school' coaching style",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (PIX11) — A New Jersey mother is sharing her daughter’s story in hopes of changing how high-caffeine drinks are labeled across the country, and the effort is now reaching Capitol Hill.\n\n“That was the day when my life changed forever,” Jill Katz said. It’s been years since her daughter Sarah died. In 2022, the 21-year-old college student went into cardiac arrest while out with friends. Her mother says it all started with a cup of lemonade, packed with caffeine.\n“She was at a friend’s birthday party, in college, and she collapsed. She didn’t make it,” Katz said. “It’s the call that keeps parents awake at night.”\n\nSarah had a heart condition, and her family says she had always been mindful about what she ate and drank. According to her mother, she didn’t realize that 30 ounces of the drink she ordered at a popular restaurant chain contained as much as 390 milligrams of caffeine.\n\nFor context, the FDA says most healthy adults should consume no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, so the drink Sarah had was close to that limit in a single serving. “With grief, there is no restoration, but transformation,” Katz said. “Being involved with her legacy and being able to save other people’s lives in her memory.”\n\nMore: Latest News from Around the Tri-State\n\nThe restaurant chain has since removed the item from its menu following multiple lawsuits.\n\nCaffeine is widely used to boost energy by stimulating metabolism and making the heartbeat faster. Doctors, however, say high doses can be risky, especially for people with underlying conditions.\n\nAccording to the Caffeine Informer database, a single shot of espresso contains about 77 milligrams of caffeine. Energy drinks can range from 80 to 300 milligrams, depending on the brand and size. “When you stimulate so much, and the heart is not prepared for that, they can just collapse,” said cardiologist Dr. Daniel Garcia.\n\nGarcia says the lack of consistent labeling and regulation around caffeine can be dangerous for everyone, from college students to older adults. “As a cardiologist, I advise completely against any energy drink or high-content caffeine drink,” he said. “You don’t know exactly what the amount is and how your body is going to respond.”\n\nNow, Sarah’s death is drawing attention from lawmakers.\n\nNew Jersey Congressman Rob Menendez is pushing for the Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act, federal legislation that would require clearer warnings about caffeine in foods and beverages.\n\nRequire companies to clearly list caffeine content on bottles, cans, and packaging.\n\nRequire chain restaurants to disclose caffeine levels on menus.\n\nFlag items with 150 milligrams or more of caffeine with a visible “high caffeine” warning.\n\nAdd advisory language about recommended daily caffeine limits.\n\nOrder federal health agencies to study caffeine’s health effects and launch public education campaigns.\n\nSupporters say the goal is not to ban caffeinated drinks, but to make sure consumers know what they’re getting before they take a sip. “People need to know what they’re putting in their bodies,” Katz said. “We’re not talking about limiting or banning. We’re talking about making an informed choice.”\n\nThe bill has bipartisan support in Congress, with a total of 14 cosponsors, both Republicans and Democrats.",

For me I put a lot of pressure on myself, I try to listen to others, figure it all out. But, I think I learned through the highs and the lows.”\n\nMust Watch: Her sister’s reaction is incredible\n\nUSWNT and North Carolina Courage midfielder Riley Jackson shares her excitement to finding out she made the senior team for the first time, her sister’s hilarious reaction, and her first ever goal contribution – an assist to Trinity Rodman.\n\nRookie of the Year finalist on her storybook season\n\nAngel City FC forward Riley Tiernan talks about her special rookie season and if she’s had a chance to take in all of the wonderful success from it.\n\n“I was not expecting any of this coming out of college. It’s everything I’ve worked for. It’s something I’ve been working towards my whole life. But, to see it all fall into place and to get these small and big accomplishments has been really special.”\n\n“I would say I’m still digesting, the fact that I’m living in the best place in the world, doing what I love to do for a job.”\n\nEmeri Adames is very serious about her national holiday idea\n\nSeattle Reign forward Emeri Adames reveals her idea for a national holiday, and you better like it!\n\n“I would do National Pickle Day because I love pickles so much. I think everyone should like pickles. And when they say they don’t like pickles, it makes me mad.”\n\nSan Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley reveals while at Target, she found out that she had made the USWNT.\n\n“It was really exciting. I had gotten an email but I don’t check it as frequently as I should. So I was a little bit late, but I saw it when I was with my mom at Target. We were both through the roof, very surprised, very full of excitement and gratitude.”\n\n2025 NWSL Midfielder of the Year\n\nNorth Carolina Courage star Manaka Matsukubo shares what it means to be honored with that award and gives plenty of love to her teammates and family.\n\n“I am honored. However, it’s not just me, it’s my teammates.”\n\nWashington Spirit and USWNT forward, and California native Trinity Rodman talks her excitement about playing at home for the 2028 LA Olympics.\n\n“It always is like this full-circle moment because I grew up here and I started playing soccer down here.”\n\n“I’m so excited. I’m going to have a lot of people, so I better start getting tickets ready for it.”\n\nJordyn Bloomer stole the show in the NWSL in 2025 and will be a player to look out for this season as well.\n\nHowever, her journey has been filled with adversity, patience, and so much more, but she has gotten past all of it. Now, she is shining brighter than ever.\n\nThe goalkeeper discussed her unique journey with us.\n\nCalifornia native Onyeka Gamero shares what it means to be coming back to her home state and join the NWSL.\n\n“I remember saying, ‘I want to be back in the U.S., I’ll go anywhere.’ But of course being in California – my parents right there, everything is so familiar.”\n\n“It just feels nice. I feel good. For me as a player, I feel like that’s where it starts, just feeling ok.”\n\nWashington Spirit star midfielder Croix Bethune shares some of the key details from her conversation with USWNT head coach Emma Hayes.\n\nCasey Murphy made a big move to the Boston Legacy joining as a free agent goalkeeper. One of the reasons she gave at NWSL media day was the titles. Boston is a city that notoriously cares deeply about their sports. Mistakes can linger in the minds of players and fans with the pressure, here’s what Murphy had to say on the matter.\n\nDid Utah Royals forward Mina Tanaka come up with the greatest holiday ever?",

The Jets signed him to a four-year contract that includes $7.9m guaranteed but after disciplinary problems and poor play he left the Jets in 2019.\n\nLee was a part of the Kansas City Chiefs roster that won the Super Bowl in February 2020, although he did not play in the game itself.

    "fullText": "At first glance, the New York Mets’ recent trade for center fielder Luis Robert Jr. was made to fill a specific hole. The Mets need a good defensive outfielder to hold the fort while prospect Carson Benge finishes developing, and Robert fits the bill.\n\nBeyond that, many consider Robert a broken player who can’t be fixed, but the Mets don’t really share that perspective. David Adler of MLB.com tried to get beneath the obvious reasons for the trade to see why the Mets have a different opinion, and he came up with three numbers that could explain the team’s logic.\n\nThe first is bat speed. According to Adler Robert ranked in the top ten percent of all players at 75.6 mph. It’s an impressive stat, but the logic here is a little sketchy. Robert’s offensive numbers have been terrible for several seasons now, so just because the former Chicago White Sox outfielder has bat speed doesn’t mean he can actually put it in play and be productive again.\n\nThe second number Adler used is the obvious one: Robert’s outs above average number was +7, and that’s why they traded for him. Mets GM David Stearn made it abundantly clear that run prevention would be a priority this season, and Robert fits the bill and then some. That particular stat reflects his strong range, which Robert will definitely need in an outfield where he’ll be playing alongside right fielder Juan Soto and a player to be named later in left\n\nThe third number is about Robert’s speed, which really hasn’t been discussed much. His sprint speed is 29.0 feet per second, according to Adler, and that puts him in the upper tier of all MLB runners. Indeed, it’s almost elite, so if Robert can hit even a little bit, he could match or exceed the 33 stolen bases he posted last year, which was a career high for him.\n\nSome of the potential associated with these numbers is obviously speculative, but the good news is that (a) they didn’t give up much to get him, and (b) contract wise, this is a low-risk deal. Robert is playing for $20 million this year, which is pricey for what he’s done offensively, but Stearns has been emphasizing short-term deals in his acquisition this offseason, so if Robert disappoint as a hitter, the Mets can simply benefit from his defense, then move on from him at the end of the season.",

Goldschmidt, 38, returns to the Yankees after hitting .274/.328/.403 for them last season.\n\n— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) February 6, 2026\n\nGoldschmidt’s 2025 season with the Yankees marked his first year in the American League after six seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals and eight with the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nSigned to a one-year, $12.5 million contract, the veteran first baseman appeared in 146 games, recording 489 at-bats. He batted .274 with 76 runs scored, 134 hits (including 31 doubles and 10 home runs), 45 RBIs, and 5 stolen bases. His on-base percentage stood at .328, slugging .403, for an OPS of .731 and a 103 wRC+ (slightly above league average).\n\nGoldschmidt showed early-season promise with a strong start in the first two months, posting higher production before settling into a more modest output overall. His power numbers dipped to a career-low 10 home runs in a full season, though he maintained solid contact and contributed defensively at first base.\n\nA memorable moment came during a series against his former Cardinals team in August, where he received a warm reception in St. Louis and delivered three hits in a Yankees victory that helped secure a sweep.\n\nCareer-wise, Goldschmidt remains one of the game’s most accomplished first basemen. Through the end of 2025, he has played 15 MLB seasons (debuting in 2011), amassing 2,190 hits, 372 home runs, 1,232 RBIs, 1,280 runs, and 174 stolen bases across 7,608 at-bats. His career batting line reads .288/.378/.504 with an .882 OPS and 63.8 WAR. He earned an NL MVP award (2022), multiple Gold Gloves, Silver Sluggers, and All-Star selections during his prime years.\n\nYankees’ Opening Day Rotation Predicted By Bleacher Report",

    "description": "The boxer allegedly failed to pay the $100,000-a-month rent on a swanky 4,629-square-foot duplex condo in Manhattan.",
    "fullText": "Former boxing champ Floyd Mayweather Jr. has been hit with three new lawsuits alleging that he failed to pay millions to two jewelry stores and owes hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent on a palatial luxury Manhattan apartment.\n\nMayweather rented the 4,629-square-foot duplex unit on the 18th and 19th floors of the Baccarat Hotel and Residences, a high-end condo tower in Midtown, in late 2024. The lease signing was reported in several outlets, including the New York Post and Architectural Digest.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in January in state court alleges that he fell behind on the $100,000-a-month rent for five months and agreed to pay up, then only gave them a portion of what was owed.\n\nThe apartment is owned by Leila and David Centner, a Miami couple who are wellness and tech entrepreneurs. The Centners purchased two condos at The Baccarat in 2016 for $15.3 million and combined them into the two-level unit later rented by Mayweather.\n\nLeila Centner told Business Insider that Mayweather initially paid the rent, then stopped in July 2025. She said she spoke to him in December about missed payments and that he appeared unaware he owed $500,000 in back rent.\n\n\"He was surprised,\" she said. \"He had no idea he was that far behind.\"\n\nMayweather made one $100,000 payment, but didn't settle the remaining balance, and didn't respond to her further efforts to reach him, Centner said.\n\n\"He did say he'd pay, and then he disappeared. We don't know why,\" Centner said.\n\nThe suit seeks $337,736.13. The sum represents the $500,000 in arrears plus late fees, minus a deposit Mayweather paid at the start of the lease and the $100,000 catch-up payment.\n\nAn attorney for Mayweather did not provide a comment by deadline. He has not responded to the lawsuit in court.\n\nIn a separate legal matter, a Miami jeweler sued Mayweather last month, alleging the boxer owes more than a million dollars for jewelry he took but never paid for.\n\nAJ's Jewelry said in a complaint filed in state court that Mayweather, described as a longtime customer, made two trips to the store in August and left with 26 Cartier, Patek Philippe, Rolex, and Audemars Piguet watches, and 15 gold chains. The suit claims that Mayweather agreed to pay the $1.675 million bill later.\n\n\"Because of the parties' long-standing relationship and prior transactions, AJ's Jewelry reasonably believed and relied upon Mayweather's promises to pay for the jewelry items that he took possession of in full,\" the complaint says.\n\n\"To date, Mayweather has only paid AJ's Jewelry $300,000 of the outstanding balance.\"\n\nThe store alleged that five checks from Mayweather between August and November bounced.\n\n\"AJ's Jewelry has repeatedly contacted Mayweather both orally and in writing, to request payment of the remaining balance for the Jewelry. Each time, Mayweather acknowledges the debt owed and promises to pay for the Jewelry, then never sends the monies owed,\" the complaint said.\n\nMayweather's attorney has not responded to the filing in court and did not offer a comment by deadline.\n\nMayweather is also facing legal action from another Miami jeweler. Leonard Sulaymanov sued him and associate Jona Rechnitz in federal court last month, accusing them of failing to honor the terms of a settlement they had reached last year over $3.9 million in watches and jewelry that Mayweather had been accused of taking and failing to pay for.\n\nMayweather's attorney did not provide a comment on that suit. Rechnitz — who is awaiting resentencing in a federal corruption case — did not respond.\n\nThe 48-year-old boxer racked up over a billion dollars in winnings over his undefeated career and has pivoted to business ventures, including real estate investment, since his 2017 retirement.\n\nIn December, Business Insider reported that Mayweather had taken out millions in mortgages on his homes in 2024 and 2025 and faced a string of lawsuits and liens. Two of Mayweather's commercial properties have been foreclosed, and he is at risk of losing a Las Vegas building that houses his strip club over $52,000 in back property taxes and penalties.\n\nIn response to Business Insider's story in December, Mayweather's lawyer, Bobby Samini, said the athlete is not \"experiencing financial strain.\"\n\n\"Floyd Mayweather rose from poverty and hardship to become one of the greatest champions in boxing history, transforming his talent and discipline into an undefeated legacy and a highly successful business empire,\" Samini said in a statement at the time. \"Creating unfounded narratives misrepresents the truth and minimizes the achievements of an individual who has risen from adversity to become one of the most successful athletes and entrepreneurs of his generation.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Mayweather filed a lawsuit against Showtime Networks, which broadcast some of his biggest fights, and former executive Stephen Espinoza, seeking more than $340 million for \"misappropriated funds\" from decade-old bouts.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Showtime and Mayweather's former manager, Al Haymon, diverted winnings from the boxer in what it called a \"long-running and elaborate scheme of financial fraud.\"\n\nHaymon, described as a \"father figure\" to Mayweather in the complaint, is not named as a defendant in the suit. He could not be reached for comment, and a close associate did not return calls.\n\n\"These baseless claims lack legal or factual merit. We strongly reject them and will respond accordingly through the court process,\" a spokesperson for Showtime parent Paramount wrote in a statement to Business Insider. Espinoza declined to comment.\n\nNote: Floyd Mayweather filed a defamation lawsuit against Business Insider in connection with a previous story about Mayweather's real estate investments. The case is pending, and BI stands by its reporting.",

    "title": "Luigi Mangione shouts 'double jeopardy' in court as 1st trial is set for June 8 at contentious hearing",
    "description": "Luigi Mangione left court shouting \"double jeopardy\" after a Manhattan judge set a trial date that edges ahead of his federal trial date.",
    "fullText": "A state court judge in New York set a July 8 trial date in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Friday, ending a nearly yearlong battle over who — federal or state prosecutors — will be first to try the accused killer, Luigi Mangione.\n\nThe short, contentious hearing ended with Mangione shouting to a courtroom audience of press and admirers about \"double jeopardy\" as he was led back to jail.\n\n\"It's the same trial twice,\" he said as he was escorted out of the courtroom in a jail uniform and handcuffs. \"One plus one equals two. Double jeopardy by any common sense definition.\"\n\nThe decision was a loss for his defense lawyers, who had urged that Mangione's state murder trial be held some time after his federal fatal stalking trial. That federal trial will now go second, with jury selection set for September 8 and opening statements for October 13.\n\n\"The defense will not be ready on July 8,\" defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo told the judge, during the hearing's most heated moment.\n\n\"Be ready!\" New York Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro answered angrily.\n\nFriedman Agnifilo told the judge that her team, which includes her husband, Marc Agnifilo, has been extremely busy winning victories for their client. In September, she said, the team convinced Carro to drop the top charge in the state indictment, murder as an act of terrorism. Last week, she said, Mangione's federal judge tossed that indictment's top two counts, removing the risk of the death penalty.\n\nBut as she started to tell Carro, \"we haven't been twiddling our thumbs,\" the judge cut her off.\n\n\"Great,\" he interrupted, his voice impatient. \"You've done a great job. So be ready on July 8.\"\n\nWho gets to try Mangione first — New York or the feds — was a thorny question that was fought over for nearly a year in neighboring courthouses in lower Manhattan. And it's a battle that's all about double jeopardy.\n\nMangione's defense lawyers accuse lead state prosecutor Joel Seidemann of pushing to go first, before the feds, because going second would violate New York case law against double jeopardy — the state's restriction on trying someone twice for the same crime.\n\nSeidemann \"does not want his case to be double-jeopardied out because he did all that work,\" Friedman Agnifilo told the judge in court.\n\nSeidemann snapped back that the defense is seeking to deprive the state of New York from prosecuting \"a murder that happened in Midtown Manhattan, on our streets, to a guest in our city.\"\n\n\"All I can say is double jeopardy is something that was meant to protect people and they're using it as a weapon,\" Agnifilo Friedman said as she left the courthouse.\n\n\"This is a tug of war between two prosecutorial offices,\" she added — suggesting that the war, lost moments earlier by Mangione, may not be over.\n\nMangione, who is charged in both indictments with fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The father of two from Minnesota was ambushed from behind as he entered a Midtown Manhattan hotel to deliver remarks at an annual investor conference.\n\nMangione has been held without bail since his arrest on December 9, 2024 following a five-day manhunt.\n\nHe remains at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where last week a man was arrested on charges that he had impersonated an FBI agent in a botched effort to free an inmate — Mangione, according to a law enforcement source",

    "title": "I used ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity to research a gnarly NYC rent situation. Here's what I learned.",
    "description": "AI tools can help interpret complex documents and help people understand their rights. You still have to check in with a human expert, though.",
    "fullText": "In New York City, three things are certain: death, taxes, and sky-high rent.\n\nThere may not be much AI can do for death. Taxes, I'm not sure. But it turns out this technology can be surprisingly helpful if you have a unique rent situation.\n\nI live in a former superintendent-occupied apartment in a prewar co-op in Manhattan. Although I signed a market-rate lease when I moved in, I later learned — with the help of AI tools — that my apartment might qualify as a \"rent-stabilized\" unit.\n\nNew York is one of a handful of cities where rent increases can be limited by law, depending on the circumstances. This is known as rent stabilization. It's a milder form of rent regulation that lets landlords charge more, but not too much more.\n\nMy apartment's rent history showed the unit had been registered as rent-stabilized in the 1980s and contained no obvious record of a deregulation event. Did that mean the apartment might still be regulated? Could I gain protection from potentially large rent increases in the future?\n\nI couldn't find clear answers on Reddit or Google, so I uploaded a photo of the apartment's rent-registration history and asked ChatGPT to help me interpret it.\n\nChatGPT walked me through the document and said this type of situation is routinely evaluated by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which oversees rent-stabilization and related rules in NYC.\n\nI told ChatGPT to show me its sources. It cited relevant provisions of the rent-stabilization code and several court decisions. AI can sometimes hallucinate, so I asked Perplexity and Google Gemini the same questions, as an initial way to double-check the facts. These AI tools reached similar high-level conclusions but differed in their reasoning and the way they cited authoritative sources. Gemini and Perplexity were better at showing their work than ChatGPT, and Gemini tended to be the most conservative in its framing, which made me trust it more.\n\nI still caught all three bots making mistakes. In one instance, Gemini cited a legal case that didn't exist. When I called it out, it quickly corrected itself. I repeated this process multiple times, reading the underlying legal provisions and pushing back on AI-powered conclusions I thought were wrong. I even role-played as a landlord, presenting arguments rental property owners might make about why my apartment is not rent-stabilized.\n\nEventually, I hit a wall. No matter how much I challenged the bots, they were confident that my situation raised legitimate questions that New York's DHCR might resolve. That's when I called a housing attorney — which cost $35 through the New York Bar Association's referral service — to sanity-check everything. After reviewing the documents, he agreed that filing a rent-overcharge complaint was reasonable. So I went ahead. The proceeding is ongoing, and no determination has been made yet.\n\nMy case is pretty unusual. But there are broader takeaways:\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer last month that he was finally prepared to drop his freeze on billions of dollars in funding for a major New York infrastructure project.\n\nBut there was a condition: In exchange for the money, Schumer had to agree to rename New York’s Penn Station and Washington’s Dulles International Airport after Trump.\n\nThe startling offer, which was described by two people familiar with the conversation, was swiftly rejected by Schumer, who told the president he didn’t have the power to deliver on such an unorthodox request.\n\nIn the weeks since, Trump has continued to withhold the more than $16 billion earmarked for the long-planned Gateway project connecting New York and New Jersey through a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River.\n\nThe two states are now suing the Trump administration over the freeze, alleging in a complaint filed earlier this week that the funding suspension is unlawful.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe episode, first reported by Punchbowl, offers a fresh window into Trump’s ever-expanding effort to secure an outsized place in American history — and to do so in part by branding nearly everything around him with his own name.\n\nSince returning to the White House, the president has introduced a slew of initiatives bearing the Trump name, including the Trump Gold Card offering a high-priced path to citizenship, the TrumpRx website offering lower-priced prescription drugs, and a new Trump-class battleship meant to solidify his era of “peace through strength” foreign policy for years to come.\n\nTrump in recent months has set his sights on even bigger targets: Adding his name first to the US Institute of Peace and then, even more controversially, to Washington’s iconic Kennedy Center.\n\nStill, Trump’s offer to Schumer would have represented perhaps his most audacious move yet, an apparent attempt to leverage the future of a massive infrastructure project to fulfill his own personal wishes.\n\nThe commission in charge of the Gateway tunnel has warned that it will soon have to shut down work on the project and lay off roughly 1,000 workers if the Trump administration does not release the funding it needs.\n\nThe tunnel’s construction predates Trump’s return to office, with the federal government on the hook for a significant portion of the funding needed to complete it. But Trump moved to halt the project late last year, a decision that Democratic officials in New Jersey and New York have argued was politically motivated.\n\nSchumer has since played a central role in trying to negotiate the unfreezing of the funding. Yet despite that priority, there’s little that the Democrat could conceivably do on his own to put Trump’s name on either Penn Station or Dulles Airport.\n\nWhile some conservative lawmakers have already introduced legislation to rename Dulles as the “Donald J. Trump International Airport,” it’s so far gained little traction.\n\nThe legislation has not advanced in the GOP-controlled Congress, and as a result remains unlikely to pass.",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets officially ended the soul searching portion of their offseason today, announcing the hire of Frank Reich as their new offensive coordinator.\n\nIn a move that feels both like a safe veteran play and a massive gamble, Head Coach Aaron Glenn has effectively handed Reich the keys to the kingdom. Glenn made it clear during the search that he wanted a head coach of the offense someone who could operate with total autonomy while Glenn refocuses on calling the defensive plays.\n\nBut for Jets fans, the question isn’t about Reich’s resume. It’s about which version of the man is stepping off the plane at Newark.\n\nTo understand the anxiety at One Jets Drive, you have to look at the two polar opposite outcomes of Reich’s recent career.\n\nThe Quarterback Whisperer (2017-2020) This is the Reich the Jets are praying for. This is the architect who helped Doug Pederson guide Nick Foles to a Super Bowl ring. This is the man who took a washed Philip Rivers in 2020 and squeezed out an 11-5 playoff season. This version of Reich is Multiple in the best way he adapts his scheme to his players, uses RPOs to protect his QB, and leans on a physical run game to set up deep shots.\n\nThe Scheme Rigid Veteran (2022-2023) This is the Reich who was fired mid season in back to back years. In Carolina, he was criticized for trying to force Bryce Young into a static pocket system that didn’t fit the rookie’s traits. The offense became predictable, horizontal, and frankly boring. This version of Reich prioritizes the system over the personnel, resulting in an offense that ranks in the bottom five of every meaningful category.\n\nIf Reich returns to his roots, the biggest winners are Breece Hall(If we bring him back. Please come back!) and Garrett Wilson.\n\nThe Run Game: Reich’s best years in Indy featured a dominant Jonathan Taylor. With Breece Hall, Reich has a weapon that can execute the Wide Zone scheme that defines his best work.\n\nThe X Factor: Garrett Wilson is the perfect rhythm receiver for Reich’s West Coast hybrid. If Reich can get back to the Triangle Reads and Mesh concepts that made the 2017 Eagles so dangerous, Wilson could see a career high in targets.",

    "description": "A single mom juggling multiple jobs, grad school, and rising costs explains what it takes to stay in New York City — and why she may have to leave.",
    "fullText": "Massiel Lugo hit the New York lottery — and it's why she can afford to stay in the city she grew up in.\n\nThe 33-year-old single mother of two took over her aunt's lease in Jackson Heights, Queens, when her second child was born. Moving into the two-bedroom was only possible because her aunt, also a single mother, left the city for a more affordable life in Georgia.\n\n\"I remember watching her struggle a lot, and then she could no longer do it on her own, and she just got up and left,\" Lugo said.\n\nWhile Lugo's apartment isn't rent-stabilized, she inherited a six-year-old lease, and her landlord has held off on raising her rent to market rate, which is around $2,900 for the typical two-bedroom in the area. Still, the Queens native wonders if she should follow in her aunt's footsteps and leave the city.\n\nWhen her son's father moved out about five years ago, Lugo sublet her second bedroom and skipped meals to make ends meet. These days, she manages to pay her $1,700 rent by juggling multiple jobs while going to school. It helps that her 16-year-old daughter, Jalene, has taken paid internships, and her parents, who live four blocks away, help care for her eight-year-old son, Ozzie, who has autism.\n\nBut the city that's always been home is feeling increasingly hostile. A growing share of New Yorkers are struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world as the costs of basic necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that's driven up rents and home prices. Family-sized apartments with two or three bedrooms are especially hard to come by. The cost crisis is pushing many out of the city, particularly families with young children and lower-income Black and Hispanic residents.\n\nNew York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, got elected on a pledge to bring these costs down. In January, he and Gov. Kathy Hochul rolled out their plan to significantly expand free and low-cost childcare for young children. Lugo was invited by the mayor's team to an event celebrating the announcement. While she supports the efforts, her kids are too old to benefit from them. Lugo and her family could see cost savings through other mayoral proposals, including free buses, city-owned grocery stores, and more affordable housing.\n\nLugo is among the more than 40% of the city's renters who spend more than a third of their gross income on housing. Her traditionally working-class immigrant neighborhood is under pressure from gentrification and the rising cost of living. At the same time, the streets and subways don't feel as safe as they did when Lugo was growing up.\n\n\"It's a love-hate relationship with New York,\" she said. \"At the end of the day, it's home, but it has changed so much.\"\n\nFor the last several years, Lugo worked both as a teacher's assistant in a public school and as a therapist for children with autism while earning her bachelor's degree. In January, she started a master's program to become a certified therapist for autistic children.\n\nOver the last few years, she's pieced together between $50,000 and $60,000 in income from her jobs and monthly child support. However, she's working less this semester to make more time for graduate school, which costs her $1,300 per semester. Eventually, she hopes to make upwards of $80,000 as a full-time certified therapist.\n\nIn the meantime, her income is barely enough to cover her family's expenses. Transportation and grocery costs have ballooned. Food costs in New York City rose by about 68% between 2013 and 2023 — much more than the national average of 49%, the state comptroller found. Lugo is an ALICE, which stands for asset-limited, income-constrained, employed, and describes someone who makes too much to qualify for most assistance, but still struggles to get by. She no longer gets food stamps, and her grocery bills have ballooned as her kids have gotten older.\n\n\"I buy food, and it's just gone,\" she said. \"I never thought I would yell at my kids, like, 'Did you guys really just finish all the juice boxes in a day?'\"\n\nDespite living a block from the 7 subway train and multiple bus lines, Lugo said she's increasingly found herself taking Ubers, in part because Ozzie is sensitive to the noise on public transit. It helps that Jalene rides transit for free because she's a public school student, and Ozzie takes a city-provided school bus because of his diagnosis.\n\nShe's also racked up about $7,000 in credit card debt by treating her kids to occasional meals out and new clothes. She was late on her rent payment last month after putting more money toward paying down her credit card.\n\n\"I used to be really good at saving, but my mindset has changed a lot. I'm just like, what am I saving up for?\" she said. \"I want to travel, I want to make memories with my kids, and that's become more of a priority for me.\"\n\nWhen Lugo's parents first moved to Queens from the Dominican Republic about 45 years ago, life was affordable for them, Lugo said. Some of her aunts and uncles were even able to buy co-ops in the area.\n\nBut the neighborhood has gentrified. Lugo remembers when the first Starbucks opened up in Jackson Heights in 2008 — it felt like a turning point. A few years ago, her father closed the bodega he owned for decades when the building was sold to a developer. The neighborhood has felt less safe in recent years, she said, with a rise in illegal brothels and disorder on the streets.\n\nLugo isn't ready to leave the city, but she'd like to raise her kids in a quieter neighborhood. She dreams of moving to Bayside, a wealthier, more suburban part of Queens, but rent and transportation costs out there would be even higher. She thinks that finding any other apartment similar in price and size to her own would be nearly impossible in the city.\n\nJalene has her sights set on Yale and wants to eventually become a lawyer. Lugo has told her she can only move away for college if she gets a full ride.\n\n\"I tell her, 'I want you to live your life. I want you to be a child, but you need to work extremely hard, because a studio is $2,000 right now. I can only imagine how much your generation is going to have to pay in the future,'\" Lugo said.",

    "description": "Among other things, Hofstra wrestler Will Conlon also likes to read and lists “Catcher in the Rye” as his favorite book.  Conlon doesn’t compare himself to the 16-year-old main character, created in the 1951 classic novel by J.D. Salinger, who dealt with the reality of adulthood in a much grimier era in New York City.  “It’s actually more of a suburban area and what I’m used to,” said Conlon, who grew up outside of Birmingham, and does find time to enjoy today’s New York City.",
    "fullText": "Among other things, Hofstra wrestler Will Conlon also likes to read and lists “Catcher in the Rye” as his favorite book.\n\n“I read that for my 12th-grade AP literature class,” said the 197-pound redshirt college sophomore from Hoover, Ala.\n\nConlon doesn’t compare himself to the 16-year-old main character, created in the 1951 classic novel by J.D. Salinger, who dealt with the reality of adulthood in a much grimier era in New York City.\n\nAnd of course, Hofstra is located 30 miles from the City on Long Island, where wrestlers can find a beach on the Atlantic Ocean as fast as they can find a much busier life in New York City.\n\n“It’s actually more of a suburban area and what I’m used to,” said Conlon, who grew up outside of Birmingham, and does find time to enjoy today’s New York City. “My coach probably doesn’t want me to say this, but there are times I go to the City to eat and eat too much.”\n\nBut Conlon, a 2023 Alabama state high school champion, does believe “100 percent” that the book’s message is helping him adapt to NCAA Division I wrestling.\n\n“(The book) had a big impact on me,” he said. “I’m due to go back through that book because there are many lessons to have been learned from it.”\n\nConlon simply calls his college wrestling career “challenging.” That included a true freshman season in 2023-24 when he went 9-15 at 184 pounds and a redshirt year last season that saw him beat two eventual national qualifiers before undergoing surgery in March to repair an ACL injury.\n\nHe returned this season much healthier and has compiled a 14-9 record through Feb. 1. Though he is not ranked, Conlon considers himself and other Hofstra teammates — like fellow redshirt sophomore Jake Slotnick, 16-11 at 165 pounds — as diamonds in the rough.\n\n“In high school and middle school when I started wrestling, I’ve felt like I’ve been looked over at times,” said Conlon, who also won an NHSCA national championship before coming to Hofstra.\n\n“For me, it’s about chipping away against the top guys in my weight class and trying to close the gap. Consistency is what’s going to get me there. The biggest aspect of my training since high school is where I’ve made myself consistent with training and doing what it takes to get better.\n\n“I’m really thankful for the coaching staff that I have now and who took a chance on me.”\n\nHofstra coach Jamie Franco, the former Pride alum who was a three-time NCAA qualifier (2012-14), believes Hofstra can return to the days when the EIWA school finished as high as seventh in the nation in 2007, but has not had an All-American since 2018 when heavyweight Michael Hughes finished sixth.\n\n“We are a young team,” said Franco, now in his second year. “We just need some experience. Fortunately, most of this team has one or two years of eligibility left.”\n\nFranco — who was introduced to the Alabama native from Conlon’s club coach, Shad Rissler, also a New York native and former prep teammate of Franco —believes that Conlon can be one of his team’s leaders.\n\n“I think he’s a better version of himself and we see each week he’s getting a little stronger,” said Franco. “We hope over the next month before the conference tournament that he keeps building and realizes how well he is doing.”\n\nWill, the son of Carol and Joshua (a former high school wrestler) Conlon, has tried to share his challenge with friends and family back home in Alabama.\n\n“I tell them what’s going on, but if I wasn’t myself, I don’t think I’d truly understand what this has been all about,” he admitted. “It’s a different beast. You have to wake up early, go to workouts and team practices and classes and then go through the competition aspect of it. Every time you compete, a guy is looking to rip your head off, and you have to be willing to do the same thing.”\n\nConlon also credits the Hofstra brotherhood in helping me adapt to his college environment and wrestling goals.\n\n“I just moved off campus this past semester into a house with six other guys and teammates. I consider all those guys my brothers,” he said. “That’s what was important for me when I came here on my visit. I felt like I was home with my family. The summer before my freshman year, I came into training with a team and felt connected with that group.”\n\nBut Conlon also believes he must take his own responsibility to reach his wrestling goals.\n\n“There is something I learned since being in college: you have to seek out the answers to what your development is going to look like and how you are going to get to the next level,” he said. “At this level, you can’t just come in and work on your two best shots of two best re-attacks, work on top and bottom and simply achieve what you want to achieve.\n\n“I feel like you have to be a fan of the sport and be watching the guys who are constantly innovating in the sport and adopting some of those habits and training methods of the best wrestlers. I think some guys don’t realize they also have to be innovators and be as much of a spectator as a competitor.”\n\nA management major, who has been on Hofstra’s Dean List in the past two years, does believe he is reaching his overall life’s goals the past three years.\n\n“Before wrestling was in the cards, which happened late in my high school career, I was thinking about going to a state school near me like Auburn or Alabama,” he said. “And while that experience might have been good, I think taking a different step and direction to wrestle in college and in a completely unknown area, it’s definitely something that aligns with my goals, which is trying out next experiences that make up my life.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlthough the Golden State Warriors’ trade for Kristaps Porzingis and the Washington Wizards’ trade for Anthony Davis (both completed on Wednesday night) will be the main topic of discussion heading into the final stretch of the trade season, it’s worth noting that the New York Knicks recently executed a deal of their own.\n\nThe 2024 Eastern Conference participants cut ties with Jalen Brunson's struggling 6-foot-7 forward via a trade to the Chicago Bulls after less than a full season.\n\n“The New York Knicks are trading Guerschon Yabusele to the Chicago Bulls for Dalen Terry,” ESPN’s Shams Charania reported early Thursday morning.\n\nYabusele has been one of the Knicks’ most disappointing contributors this season, regardless of position. Following an inspiring 2024-25 campaign with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2024-25 (he averaged 11.0 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, while shooting 50.1% from the field and 38.0% from deep), the Knicks felt comfortable taking a chance on him in free agency.\n\nIt’s clear now that New York’s decision backfired, as the former first-round pick was virtually unplayable for first-year head coach Mike Brown this year. Yabusele contributed only 2.7 points and 2.1 rebounds per game with the Knicks, connecting on 39.3% of his field goals and 29.4% from three-point land.\n\nTerry isn’t a high-level bench contributor, either, but it’s challenging to envision him being worse than Yabusele in New York.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors cut ties with Stephen Curry's 6-foot-9 fan-favorite teammate via trade to Raptors",

    "description": "Artemi Panarin’s run on Broadway is over. After seven memorable seasons with the New York Rangers, Panarin’s off to Hollywood",
    "fullText": "Artemi Panarin’s run on Broadway is over. After seven memorable seasons with the New York Rangers, Panarin’s off to Hollywood following a trade to the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nPanarin had 607 points (205 goals, 402 assists) in 482 regular-season games over seven seasons with the Rangers, and his 1.26 points-per-game average is best in franchise history. He ranks eighth all-time for the Rangers in assists, ninth in points, and 14th in goals.\n\nHe left behind a treasure trove of memorable highlights in New York, and will be remembered as one of the most exciting players ever to wear the Blueshirts sweater.\n\nLet’s break down the 10 greatest moments for Panarin during his tenure with the Rangers.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin and former Blue Jackets teammate Sergei Bobrovsky are dear friends, but the Breadman made his countryman — and star defenseman Aaron Ekblad — look silly when he dangled around both and snuck a back-hand shot past the Florida Panthers goalie for a highlight-reel goal in the first period in Sunrise, Florida.\n\nWhy it was great: Before arriving in New York, Panarin owned the Rangers, with 12 goals and 18 points in 12 career games. So it was a relief to see Panarin register his first three-goal game in a Blueshirts sweater in Game 31 of his first season. Panarin had an assist on Mika Zibanejad‘s power-play goal that tied the game, then sealed the hat trick with a pair of goals late in the third period of the Rangers’ 6-3 win over the San Jose Sharks.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin scored a career-high four goals against the Carolina Hurricanes, helping the Rangers turn a 2-1 second-period deficit into a 6-2 laugher. He also had an assist to record points on five of New York’s six goals.\n\nWhy it was great: Maybe the last memorable moment for Panarin in a Rangers sweater. With New York up 1-0 late in the first period, Panarin floated a seeing-eye shot past Bobrovsky in the outdoor contest played in Miami. It ended up being the game-winning goal, and Panarin also added an assist in the Rangers’ 5-1 win over the Panthers.\n\nWhy it was great: It’s easy to forget how far the Rangers had fallen and how quickly that drop off was after so much success for most of the 2010s. But the Letter 1.0, authored in February 2018 by then-GM Jeff Gorton and team president Glen Sather, ushered in a rebuild that climaxed earlier than expected when Panarin signed a mammoth seven-year, $81.5 million contract. The Rangers outbid the Islanders and Blues Jackets for his services, and Panarin was worth every penny. He led the Rangers in scoring six straight seasons before traded to the Kings, and the Blueshirts reached the Eastern Conference Final in 2022 and 2024, and won the Presidents’ Trophy in 2023-24 with Panarin a vital member of their core.\n\nWhen: Oct. 12, 2023-Nov. 18, 2023\n\nWhy it was great: The 2023-24 season was undoubtedly Panarin’s best ever, and he started it with a bang by setting the Rangers record for longest season-opening point streak. Panarin had 10 goals and 16 assists, and the Rangers were 12-2-1 in that stretch. That streak set New York on the path toward its Metropolitan Division championship and the franchise’s fourth Presidents’ Trophy. It also started Panarin on the way to 120 points, second most in Rangers history.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin often showed off his Rockettes-style leg kick after big goals, but it all started with this highlight-reel tally against the Detroit Red Wings early in 2020. Panarin dangled around Detroit defenseman Alex Biega then snuck a back-hand shot past Jimmy Howard to put the Rangers up 3-0. He sealed the goal with a kick, which became his signature celebration.\n\nWhy it was great: Playing outside at MetLife Stadium in front of a pro-Rangers crowd crowd of roughly 80,000, the Blueshirts fell behind 4-1 in the second period then trailed 5-3 in the late stages of the third period against the rival Islanders. Yet, Chris Kreider deflected Panarin’s point shot on the power play past Ilya Sorokin to make it 5-4. After Zibanejad tied it with another power-play tally, Panarin sent the Rangers fans into delirium by stealing Noah Dobson’s pass on the opening shift of overtime and beating Sorokin for an emotional 6-5 comeback win, though only after video review upheld his OT winner.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin scored the game-winning goal in Game 1 of the Rangers’ second-round playoff series against the Hurricanes, then had three assists in a 4-3 win in Game 2. But the Rangers coughed up a late 2-1 lead in Game 3 on the road when Andrei Svechnikov tied the score with the net empty at the other end. But Panarin’s hard work paid off early in OT, when he got inside position on Carolina’s Jalen Chatfield and redirected Vincent Trocheck‘s pass by Pyotr Kochetkov for the game-winning goal at 1:43 of the extra session, giving the Rangers a commanding 3-0 lead in the series. The Rangers ultimately claimed the series in six games.\n\nWhy it was great: It had been five years since the Rangers won a series in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and they looked destined for another early exit after losing a three-overtime classic in Game 1 and fell behind 3-1 to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the best-of-7 first round — especially after they allowed seven goals apiece in Games 3 and 4. But after the Rangers won Games 5 and 6, sending the series to MSG for Game 7, Panarin authored his signature Rangers moment, fittingly on the power play in overtime of the do-or-die game. He dusted off a pass from Adam Fox twice then wristed the game-winner through traffic and past Tristan Jarry, sending the Rangers to the second round.\n\nRangers trade Artemi Panarin to Kings for Liam Greentree, draft picks\n\nEx-Rangers captain Jacob Trouba throws shade, ‘having more fun’ in Anaheim\n\nRangers running out of time to trade Artemi Panarin before NHL roster freeze\n\nRangers coach provides brief Artemi Panarin update, waiting for trade",

    "description": "We're hiring! Join the Converge team in NYC and do your best work!",
    "fullText": "Help us build everything a consumer brand needs to grow. We’re just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). You’ll be shipping end-to-end product and working directly with customers.\n\nWe want to profitably grow the world's consumer brands. That begins with helping them understand which marketing efforts are driving profitable growth.\n\n200+ consumer brands, including publicly traded companies, rely on Converge to check in on their marketing performance up to a dozen times a day. They drill down to figure out what's working and decide where to shift million-dollar marketing budgets.\n\nTo ship even more, we've raised $5.7M from some of the best investors, including Y Combinator, General Catalyst, and the founders of Posthog, Algolia, Shipbob, ...\n\nShip product fully end-to-end. All the way from designing the system and data models to building out the interface and polishing the experience.\n\nWe trust you to build the best solution to a customer's problem. We lead with context and give you full autonomy to design the solution. This means you'll need to build a deep understanding of the problem, obsess over the solution, and ship it.\n\nWork directly with customers. You'll talk to them, ship, get feedback, and iterate. There are no middlemen. This means you can move incredibly fast: you message a customer, create a PR, and can have it fixed within hours.\n\nSome examples of projects you could own:\n\nEffortless Slack conversations: Customers screenshot their Converge reports up to a dozen of times a day (!) to share with the rest of the company. Instead, they should be able to directly tag and message a teammate from any number in Converge and have this synced bidirectionally with Slack.\n\nCentralizing all growth efforts: Converge already centralizes all growth metrics, but the information explaining them is still scattered. We want overlay the context that actually explains trends like pricing updates, budget changes, and promo calendars.\n\nCreative analytics: All growth teams use a separate tool to iterate on ad creatives, but they would want to run this workflow on Converge. We should build a Creative Analytics product on top of our data.\n\nAI agents: We never wanted to jump on the AI train for the sake of hype. But now that we have the foundations in place, there's huge leverage in building agents that can help growth teams understand their data and act on it more quickly.\n\nWe're a team of just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). Join us if you want to get rid of office politics and just take ownership to get a lot done.\n\nEven though you join early, this job comes with real engineering challenges. We process $4B in online orders annually, 20TB of data flows through Converge each month, and we've collected around 10B customer interactions to date.\n\nWhat you're shipping will actually get used. 50% of our customers use us daily (!), while this is only 13% for the average SaaS company. You will have an immediate impact.\n\nWe love working in-person. You'll like it here if you do too.\n\nIf you think you could be a founder, there's no better way to learn than to talk to customers and ship. That's what you'll be spending all of your time on. We obsess over the details and will share honest feedback.\n\nStrong experience working across the stack (4+ YOE). We work with React, Python, Postgres, and Clickhouse. Experience building data-intensive products or familiarity with Clickhouse is a plus.\n\nYou've previously built products or large features fully end-to-end.\n\nYou obsess over the quality of what you're building, both in UX and code.\n\nSalary: $175K - $240K + equity (0.6% - 0.85%).\n\nPrivate health, dental, and vision insurance.\n\nIntro call (30 min): We want to learn about your motivations to join Converge, determine why you’d be a great fit, and answer any questions you have for us.\n\nTechnical (1h): We work through a typical engineering problem we face at Converge.\n\nCulture (45 min): We dive into your past experiences to learn how you like to work and what motivates you.\n\nSuperday (1 day): Join us for a day to actually build something! You get to meet the team, we get to meet you, it's great. (fully paid)\n\n(*) This can all be done in 2 days. If you want to move quickly, we do too. Our founding engineer was on a plane to meet us just days after our first call.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON/NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Oil refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast are struggling to absorb a rapid surge in Venezuelan crude shipments since last month's flagship $2 billion supply deal between Caracas and Washington, pressuring prices and leaving some volumes unsold, according to traders and shipping data.\n\nWhat challenges are U.S. refiners facing with Venezuelan crude?\n\nHow might India's trade deal affect Venezuelan oil sales?\n\nWhat role do trading houses play in Venezuelan exports?\n\nHow has Venezuelan oil export volume changed recently?\n\nThe soft U.S. demand represents ​an early obstacle for President Donald Trump's hopes of sending the majority of the South American country's oil to the United States since U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro ‌last month in a raid in Caracas.\n\nTrading houses Vitol and Trafigura were granted U.S. licenses to market and sell millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil following the U.S. operation and a subsequent supply agreement with interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\nThe trading houses, ‌which joined energy major Chevron in holding approval to export Venezuelan oil, struck several early deals to sell some cargoes to refiners in the U.S. and Europe. However, with Chevron also raising exports quickly, the trading companies are now finding it harder to secure enough buyers among Gulf Coast refiners, traders said.\n\n\"We're all facing this issue where there's more to place and not enough takers,\" one of the traders said, citing reluctance from U.S. refiners to buy Venezuelan crude. Some refiners are complaining that prices, albeit declining, remain high compared to competing Canadian heavy grades.\n\nVenezuelan heavy oil cargoes for delivery at the Gulf Coast are being offered at ⁠about $9.50 per barrel below benchmark Brent, versus discounts of between $6 and $7.50 per ‌barrel in mid-January.\n\nLast month, total Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. almost tripled to 284,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data based on tanker movements.\n\nThe U.S. was absorbing some 500,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil before Washington imposed sanctions on the country in 2019. But exports to the U.S. went to zero in mid-2025 ‍after Trump revoked all licenses to trade and ship.\n\nReaching the U.S. refiners' maximum capacity again will require time, one of the traders said, in part because some facilities would require adjustments to process heavier oil.\n\nThe chief executive of refiner Phillips 66, Mark Lashier, said on Tuesday the company can process around 250,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude, but prices must be competitive for Venezuelan grades to displace other sources of heavy oil.\n\nChevron and Trafigura declined to comment. ​Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA and Vitol did not reply to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Free groceries, courtesy of your favorite prediction market.\n\nThat's the stunt that both Kalshi and Polymarket are attempting to pull off in New York City, in an apparent nod to Mayor Zohran Mamdani's pledge to open city-run grocery stores.\n\nKalshi's offering arrived first, offering shoppers up to $50 worth of free groceries at Westside Market, a grocery store in Manhattan's East Village on Tuesday.\n\nBusiness Insider attended the event and found a long line.\n\nThe promotion runs from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. ET at Westside Market on 84 3rd Ave.\n\nF it. Free groceries for everyone.\n\nTomorrow 12pm.\n\nWest Side Market | 84 3rd Ave. NYC pic.twitter.com/rsrunK5brt\n\nBut Polymarket says it's going even bigger, opening its own grocery store in the city next week — \"New York's first free grocery store\" — for a limited time.\n\n\"The Polymarket is fully stocked. No purchase required. We're open to all New Yorkers,\" the company said. \"Free groceries. Free markets. Built for the people who power New York. We'll see you at The Polymarket's grand opening next week.\"\n\nAfter months of planning, we're excited to announce 'The Polymarket' is coming to New York City.\n\nNew York's first free grocery store.\n\nWe signed the lease. And we donated $1 million to Food Bank For NYC — an organization that changes how our city responds to hunger. 🧵 pic.twitter.com/BGMCWUMz8n\n\nThe address has yet to be announced by the company, but Polymarket says the store will be open from Thursday, February 12 at noon until Sunday, February 15.\n\nThe prediction market also says it donated $1 million to Food Bank for New York City. A spokesperson for Food Bank for New York City confirmed the donation to Business Insider.\n\n\"The activation is the result of months of planning — from securing permits and building out a dedicated retail space to coordinating logistics and nonprofit partnerships — and represents a direct investment in the city where Polymarket was founded and scaled,\" reads a release from the prediction market platform.\n\nKalshi and Polymarket have exploded in popularity over the last year and a half, and the giveaways are likely to raise the companies' profiles and brand recognition even further.\n\nBoth prediction markets have moved to partner with media organizations. Polymarket partnered with the Golden Globes and Dow Jones, while Kalshi has struck deals with CNN and CNBC.\n\nPrediction markets have also faced greater scrutiny from lawmakers, especially after an anonymous Polymarket trader made hundreds of thousands of dollars off a well-timed bet on former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's political future, sparking concerns about insider trading.\n\nThat's led some prediction markets to push back, with Kalshi emphasizing that it has rules against insider trading and supports efforts to regulate the practice.\n\nUpdate, February 3, 2026 — This story has been updated to clarify Food Bank of New York's involvement with the Polymarket initiative.",

    "description": "I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, for a slower pace of life and lower costs. Although I found both of those things, I feel lonely in my new city.",
    "fullText": "After two years of living in New York City, I realized that, although I loved life in the Big Apple, I wasn't fond of the exorbitant cost of living.\n\nMy days in the city were busy — think last-minute Broadway tickets, venturing out to Brooklyn for my photojournalism class, and bottomless brunches that turned into all-day affairs. Still, I found that leaving my apartment was costly, and I knew I needed a change.\n\nSo, moving to Charlotte, North Carolina, seemed like a practical decision. My dad was an hour and a half away, the culture felt less cutthroat, and the cost of rent didn't make me cringe.\n\nAt first, the change was refreshing. I traded crowded subway cars for tree-lined streets and pricey rooftop bars for local breweries.\n\nI even went from paying $4,600 a month for a studio apartment in NYC to $2,489 for an updated one-bedroom apartment with tons of amenities.\n\nHowever, as I began settling into life in Charlotte, the slower pace that I craved began to feel isolating.\n\nOn paper, my job sounds exciting — telling people I'm a travel writer is an instant conversation starter. But behind the trips, Instagram-worthy pictures, and articles, most of my work happens alone.\n\nWorking for a small media company means I don't have coworkers, either. Aside from one weekly meeting with my boss, my days are quiet until I leave for my next work trip.\n\nLuckily, when I'm traveling on assignment, I'm rarely alone. From striking up conversations with crew members to befriending fellow travelers, I'm constantly meeting new people from all walks of life.\n\nThose interactions are among the most rewarding parts of my job, but they only happen a few days each month.\n\nPlus, I often leave these trips feeling drained, which makes it hard to put myself out there and build new friendships when I'm home in Charlotte.\n\nBack in New York, I already had established relationships, which meant I didn't feel like I was \"starting over\" whenever I returned from a trip.\n\nAnd although I've tried finding a community in Charlotte through networking events, friend-of-a-friend invitations, and coffee meet-ups, I realized that building genuine connections postgrad is a slow and painful process — especially when you don't have any built-in social circles from work.\n\nAlthough there's plenty to do in Charlotte, many of the events have started to feel familiar and repetitive, rather than exciting and new — especially after living in the city for over three years.\n\nAt times, I appreciate the quieter lifestyle. However, after a while, the coffee shops, breweries, and parks all seem to blur together.\n\nAlthough I was usually sitting at the same few bars in New York, I never knew what characters would stroll by outside, or what subway performers I'd see in transit.\n\nIn Charlotte, though, even small errands and walks with my dog feel mundane. The predictability of walking the same streets, seeing the same faces, and sitting in the same traffic on I-77 makes Charlotte feel a lot smaller than it is — and, at times, isolating.\n\nBuilding a life in North Carolina has taken longer than expected, and some days, the seemingly endless tapping of my lone keyboard amid the hum of my air purifier is deafening.\n\nHowever, I don't regret my decision to move here.\n\nMy partner and I can now afford a lifestyle that seemed out of reach in New York. We have space to entertain, and the lower cost of living means we can splurge on our hobbies, including our ever-growing Lego collection, traveling, or concert tickets.\n\nAnd although I haven't quite solved the loneliness part just yet, I'm trying to show up",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants have suffered another setback in their search for an offensive coordinator, as Davis Webb has opted to remain with the Denver Broncos in a promotion rather than join the team in East Rutherford.\n\nWebb, a former Giants third-round draft pick in 2017 who started one game for Big Blue in the 2022 season finale, interviewed for the vacant OC position under new head coach John Harbaugh.\n\nThe Giants requested the interview in late January, viewing Webb's rising reputation -- bolstered by his work developing quarterbacks like Russell Wilson and Bo Nix in Denver -- as a strong fit for guiding young signal-caller Jaxson Dart.\n\nHowever, on Monday, the Broncos promoted Webb from passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach to offensive coordinator, filling the vacancy created by the recent firing of Joe Lombardi following Denver's deep playoff run.\n\nSources: Denver’s passing game coordinator Davis Webb has reached agreement to become the Broncos’ offensive coordinator. Webb interviewed for three head coaching jobs during this hiring cycle, had other offensive coordinator opportunities, but opted to remain with the Broncos. pic.twitter.com/pYVZTJPNWD\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) February 2, 2026\n\nThis decision allows Webb to stay under head coach Sean Payton, another ex-Giant, where he has thrived since joining the staff in 2023 after retiring from playing.\n\nThe Giants had hoped to pair Harbaugh with Todd Monken, his former OC in Baltimore, but Monken took the Cleveland Browns head coaching job. The team has conducted virtual interviews with other candidates, including Jim Bob Cooter, Kliff Kingsbury, Brian Callahan, and Alex Tanney, with in-person meetings expected soon for finalists.\n\nWhile Webb's familiarity with the organization and his offensive acumen made him an intriguing option, his choice to accept the Broncos' promotion leaves the Giants continuing their pursuit of a proven play-caller to elevate the offense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Davis Webb won't become New York Giants' OC, opts to remain in Denver",

    "description": "Some Uber Eats workers in NYC will have their accounts reactivated under a settlement. The move addresses a major pain point for delivery drivers.",
    "fullText": "New York City is taking aim at one of the biggest complaints from gig workers: Account deactivations.\n\nOn Friday, the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, or DCWP, said that Uber Eats would reinstate the accounts of as many as 10,000 people that were deactivated between December 2023 and September 2024.\n\nThe reactivations are part of a settlement under which Uber Eats, Fantuan, and HungryPanda will pay a cumulative $5.2 million over violations of New York City's minimum pay law for delivery workers. Some of that money will be paid out to roughly 49,000 delivery workers in New York City as damages, according to the DCWP.\n\nBoth the reinstatements and the payouts are meant to compensate workers after the apps either didn't pay workers or deactivated their accounts after customers cancelled their orders, according to the DCWP. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAffected workers should have their accounts automatically reactivated, a spokesperson for the DCWP told Business Insider. Delivery workers who don't get back on to the app but believe that their accounts were deactivated due to their cancellation rates should file a complaint with the Department, the spokesperson added.\n\nNew York City's settlement is the latest government effort to regulate deactivations among gig workers. Last year, Seattle implemented a law regulating how gig work apps deactivate workers' accounts. The law requires the app to provide 14 days of notice before a deactivation and says that a human must review the choice, for instance.\n\nThe settlement is also New York City's latest action related to gig workers since Mayor Zohran Mamdani took office one month ago. Since then, the city has warned delivery apps over their pay practices and started enforcing a law aimed at increasing delivery workers' earnings from tips.\n\nFor delivery workers on apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash, deactivations can pose a major threat to their earnings.\n\nThe delivery services often deactivate accounts with little warning or explanation, Business Insider has reported previously. As independent contractors, delivery workers don't have the same protections as full-time employees. All the while, gig workers can miss out on work and earnings.\n\nWhile some workers try to fight the deactivations, many apps require them to go through binding arbitration, which means that workers can't appeal the decision about their account.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Chief Justice John Roberts has started asking Supreme Court staff to sign non-disclosure agreements after a pro-Donald Trump judicial decision and memo were leaked to the press.\n\nRoberts, 71, likes to describe court members and employees as a family, and for years relied on more low-key measures to keep the court’s decision-making process secret, The New York Times reported.\n\nHe lectured clerks at the start of each term and distributed a written code of conduct that instructed clerks of their “duties of complete confidentiality, accuracy, and loyalty,” which only mentioned the possibility of unspecified sanctions in the case of breaches.\n\nBut two weeks after Trump was re-elected in 2024, Roberts summoned the court’s employees and asked them to sign legally binding NDAs requiring them to keep the court’s inner workings secret, five sources told the Times.\n\nThe agreements, which new arrivals have also been required to sign, threaten legal action if clerks or other members of the court’s support staff reveal confidential information, the paper’s sources said.\n\nIt’s not clear whether the justices themselves were also asked to sign confidentiality agreements, as the court declined to comment to the Times.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out for comment as well.\n\nRoberts’ crackdown follows a series of humiliating court leaks that have plagued the court since Politico was given a draft decision of the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson case that overturned the federal right to an abortion.\n\nThe court has also been rocked by revelations about disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate about a case involving Idaho’s abortion ban, a battle over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nRoberts’ decision to impose NDAs came just weeks after the Times quoted from the confidential immunity memos, according to the Times.\n\nThe move comes as critics are calling for more transparency at the Supreme Court, which is facing record-low public trust as the conservative justices greenlight the vast majority of Trump’s policies.\n\nRoberts, however, went in the other direction and mandated more secrecy, not less.\n\nThe last time prior to 2024 that Supreme Court clerks were asked to sign a document agreeing to abide by the court’s confidentiality rules appears to have been in the late 1990s, after a former clerk published a tell-all book in 1998, according to the Times.\n\nThose documents, however, did not amount to legal NDAs, according to some of the clerks that signed them.\n\nThe switch to formal contracts is “a sign of the court’s own weakness” and the erosion of internal cohesion, Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor, told the Times.",

    "fullText": "We now know how Knicks feel about trading for Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks are among the franchises that have been linked to Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo on the trade market.\n\nIf the Knicks were to trade for the two-time MVP before the upcoming Feb. 5 trade deadline, there would be no excuse for New York to fall short of an NBA Finals appearance for the second consecutive season.\n\nAccording to a recent report from ESPN’s Brian Windhorst, it’s clear how New York feels about trading for Antetokounmpo this season.\n\n“The Knicks believe in this team,\" Windhorst said Monday. “They believed in this team last summer when Giannis was loosely available in those discussions. They didn't make an aggressive offer at the time to progress those talks.”\n\n“If they want to win a bidding war now, I think it's going to take a three or four-team trade where they take some of their players and get other assets for them, and then come back to the Bucks and make very strong offers. That is just not happening. They are not showing that aggression to get Giannis right now, and I think that's because they like this team.\"\n\nThe Knicks’ stance on potentially acquiring Antetokounmpo from Milwaukee wouldn’t have made sense a few weeks ago. After starting the year with a 23-9 record, the franchise lost nine of its next 11 games and appeared to be headed toward a complete meltdown.\n\nHowever, the Jalen Brunson-led Knicks have turned things around since then, winning six straight games, with five of them being double-digit victories.\n\nAlthough Antetokounmpo has the championship experience New York is missing, it’s understandable that the Knicks would want to roll with their current group and attempt to bring a title to New York in June.\n\nMore NBA: Lakers linked to trade for 'sleeper' $37.7 million Warriors guard",

According to the New York Post’s Mike Puma, Diaz came out of the celebration unable to put weight on his right knee, and was put in a wheelchair.\n\nSoonafter, it was revealed that he had suffered a full-thickness tear of the patellar tendon in his right knee, requiring him to miss the entirety of the 2023 MLB season.\n\nAfter a down season in 2024, returning from a year-long absence because of knee surgery, Díaz produced one of his best seasons ever in 2025. He posted a 1.63 ERA with 98 strikeouts over 66 1/3 innings, recording 28 saves.\n\nPuerto Rico is listed at +1600 to win the 2026 World Baseball Classic over on FanDuel. Our complete FanDuel Sportsbook review shows you how to sign up and use their platform.\n\nAt the end of the season, he opted out from his deal with the Mets, testing the free agent market for the first time. He was the best reliever available this winter.\n\nDíaz signed with the two-time defending champion Dodgers in free agency in December, Will Sammon of The Athletic first reported Díaz’s.\n\nThe closer’s contract is a three-year deal worth $69 million per Jeff Passan of ESPN. It’s a new record of average annual value for a reliever.\n\nNew York’s offer to Díaz was $66 million over three years with “modest deferrals,” per Joel Sherman of the New York Post.\n\nEx-Yankees, Mets pitcher announces retirement\n\nEx-Mets reliever scooped up by division rival\n\nMets sign former Dodgers catcher with two World Series rings\n\nMets’ Carlos Mendoza gives sneak peek into big lineup decision\n\nYankees add former Mets minor pitcher of the year",

    "fullText": "The House Committee on Education and Workforce has asked the University of Utah to schedule a briefing to discuss the school’s plans to take money from a New York-based private equity firm.\n\nThe committee, which has jurisdiction over federal education policy, is examining the growing trend of schools seeking institutional partners to capitalize their athletic departments. The group is assessing whether legislative action might be needed to address concerns about the downstream impact of these deals.\n\nColorado's Dempsey Goes From House Objector to China Scholar\n\nSports Tech Mergers Double in Value in 'Landmark Year'\n\nCollege Recruiting Costs Shrink as Football Powers Adapt to Portal\n\nIn a letter sent to Utah president Taylor Randall on Monday morning, a copy of which was viewed by Sportico, the committee requested that the school share information regarding the details and motives behind its potential partnership with Otro Capital, which its trustees greenlit in December.\n\n“While recognizing the escalating costs in collegiate athletics, including revenue share obligations under the House v. NCAA settlement, NIL-related expenses and coaching salaries, the committee seeks to better understand the university’s rationale for entering into this arrangement,” committee chair Tim Walberg (R—Mich.) and Burgess Owens (R—Utah), a former NFL and University of Miami player and chairman of the subcommittee on Higher Education Workforce Development, wrote in the letter. “The information and briefing requested will assist the committee in determining whether legislative action may be necessary to protect students, schools and the integrity of college athletics.”\n\nAs conversations between schools and institutional funds have grown more public, so too have concerns from lawmakers. Last month, on the verge of the College Football Playoff title game, Reps. Michael Baumgartner (R—Wash.) and Haley Stevens (D—Mich.) wrote a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker asking him to limit the emergence of PE deals that “threaten the integrity of university governance and the quality of college sports in ways that will have disastrous consequences for athletes, students and fans.”\n\nLocal state-level lawmakers in both Utah and Washington have proposed bills that would also make it harder to execute these deals.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce’s letter to Randall requests that the university share terms of the arrangement and answer three specific questions:\n\nWhat factors and considerations led the university to pursue this partnership, and why was this approach selected over other potential financing options?\n\nWhat steps is the university taking to maintain institutional control and to protect student-athlete welfare, including compliance with Title IX under this partnership structure?\n\nHow might this partnership affect student costs, particularly with respect to mandatory student fees that subsidize the athletic department, and are any changes to the fee structure anticipated following implementation?\n\nRepresentatives for Utah and its athletic department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe University of Utah trustees voted during their December meeting to allow Randall, athletic department Mark Harlan and others to finalize a deal with Otro. While it’s unclear if that final arrangement has been signed, the structure of the deal was openly discussed. Utah is spinning the Utes’ athletics revenue streams into a for-profit entity, and plans to sell an equity stake in that business.\n\nRandall played a prominent part in the formal 110-minute pitch to the trustees, helping explain the macro reasons why Utah is seeking the money, and why Otro Capital was the right partner.\n\nFinancial specifics, however, have been sparse. The school has declined to share details on a deal that likely tops nine figures. A Sportico open records request for any term sheet between the school and Otro, filed back in September, is yet to be fulfilled following multiple university extensions.\n\nUtah is not alone in seeking institutional money to adapt to the modern economics of college sports. The Big Ten, for example, was recently on the verge of a $2.4 billion partnership with a California pension fund, but those talks are now on hold after pushback from some conference members about the 20-year revenue share commitment that came with the deal.\n\nThe Big 12 is in advanced talks on a potential $500 million deal with Collegiate Athletic Solutions (CAS), a fund backed by RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital, that would let schools take upfront money in exchange for revenue sharing on the back end. That deal, unlike the proposals involving Utah and the Big Ten, does not involve any equity changing hands.\n\nSeparately, a number of other schools, such as Kentucky and Clemson, have created similar separate commercial entities, but they are yet to take outside institutional investment. Those deals are widely considered necessary step for public schools to take on institutional money for athletics.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce, which dates back to 1867, has 21 majority members, and 16 minority members. Under House Rule X, the committee is tasked with reviewing and coordinating “laws, programs and government activities relating to domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student assistance within the jurisdiction of other committees.”\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2025?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings\n\nEverything to Know About the 2025 Emirates NBA Cup",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets are going through the process of hiring their next offensive coordinator after Tanner Engstrand's shocking dismissal.\n\nAccording to multiple reports including ESPN, the Jets are down to three candidates. That list includes Greg Roman, Frank Reich, and Darrell Bevell.\n\nAll three candidates possess previous experience coordinating NFL offenses.\n\nJets Wire has ranked them from best to worst.\n\nGreg Roman spent the previous two campaigns coordinating the Los Angeles Chargers offense for Jim Harbaugh. He previously worked under John Harbaugh with the Baltimore Ravens and was key throughout Lamar Jackson's formative years. Roman failed to maximize Justin Herbert in L.A., but his track record is better than the alternatives.\n\nFrank Reich has been the overwhelming favorite to become Aaron Glenn's coordinator and play caller. Reich enjoyed a fairly successful stint as the Indianapolis Colts' head coach (2018-22), but the follow-up job he did with the Carolina Panthers was disastrous. A decision could arrive this week.\n\nDarrell Bevell was Pete Carroll's long-term offensive coordinator with the Seattle Seahawks. Since then, his reputation has taken a negative turn. Bevell coordinated a bad Detroit Lions offense in 2020 before becoming their interim head coach following Matt Patricia's midseason firing, and the same thing happened to him in 2021 in Jacksonville with Urban Meyer.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Ranking the Jets' 3 OC candidates from best to worst",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants face a critical wide receiver need heading into the offseason, as highlighted in Pro Football Focus' analysis of teams' biggest priorities for free agency and the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nPFF believes the Giants should focus on adding a receiver at No. 5 overall. Specifically, Ohio State wideout Carnell Tate.\n\nBiggest Need: Wide receiver Target: WR Carnell Tate, Ohio State\n\nMalik Nabers flashed star potential as a rookie in 2024, ranking eighth out of 133 qualifying wide receivers in PFF overall grade (86.7). He appeared in just four games this season before suffering a torn ACL, so we didn’t get an opportunity to see how he would develop with quarterback Jaxson Dart.\n\nBeyond Nabers, the Giants' wide receiver unit looks thin, especially since slot specialist Wan'Dale Robinson is heading into free agency and may not be back with the team. Sometimes overshadowed by Jeremiah Smith at Ohio State, Tate is a polished prospect in his own right after finishing fifth in the FBS with an 89.0 PFF receiving grade. He also did not drop a single pass across 66 targets this season.\n\nNabers' injury-shortened 2025 campaign underscores the urgency for depth and a reliable complement.\n\nTate, a 6-foot-3 OSU standout, offers elite reliability -- boasting a near-perfect drop rate and strong efficiency even while sharing targets with top talents. His high PFF grades and production (875 yards and nine touchdowns in 2025 despite missing time) position him as a potential top-10 pick, frequently mocked to the Giants at No. 5.\n\nTargeting Tate makes strategic sense to bolster Jaxson Dart's options and build around Nabers long-term. While the draft class is deep, passing on a polished, high-upside receiver like Tate could prolong the Giants' offensive struggles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Should New York Giants target WR Carnell Tate?",

The CEO of Wasserman, a massive Hollywood firm, wrote about wanting to see Maxwell in a tight leather outfit, asking for a massage, and suggesting they “continue the massage concept” in bed. In one thread, Wasserman, 51, who was two years into his marriage to music supervisor Laura Ziffren at the time, appeared to try to set up a time to meet Maxwell, 64, in New York City.",

    "description": "Courtney Kinnare's art career has taken off since moving from LA to NYC. But in one of the most expensive cities in the world, it comes at a cost.",
    "fullText": "A couple of years out of college and in the midst of a pandemic, Courtney Kinnare took several big risks. The Californian quit her job in sustainable packaging design in Los Angeles, became a full-time artist, and moved to New York City.\n\n\"I just took the leap,\" said Kinnare, now 29. \"I was just like, if I go for it, I have no choice but to make it work out.\"\n\nShe wasn't totally prepared for what it would cost her. When Kinnare moved across the country in 2021, New York City rents began to rise as many others returned after the pandemic. Like many artists, she pays double rent — for her apartment and her studio — and her income swings dramatically, making it hard to budget.\n\nAt the same time, living in New York has turbocharged Kinnare's career. She's constantly meeting gallery owners, seeing new art, and getting exposure to new customers. But while her income has more than doubled in a few years, she often works seven days a week — and the money she makes doesn't go very far.\n\nKinnare is among a growing share of New Yorkers struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world, as the costs of necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that has driven up rents and home prices.\n\nNew York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, got elected on a pledge to bring these costs down, including for artists. In January, he promised to \"make New York affordable to make the arts,\" and said his administration would also make arts and culture more accessible for working-class people. He's facing a dismal trend. After years of growth in the creative industries, the city has lost a significant number of artists since the pandemic.\n\n\"I've always been able to figure it out,\" Kinnare said, but, \"every month I'm like, 'Okay, how am I making money this month?'\"\n\nWhen she first arrived in the city, Kinnare spent $2,000 on rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn that she also used as her art studio. Eventually, she moved in with two roommates and rented a separate studio, where she had more room to grow her craft.\n\nLast year, she moved in with her partner, and spends about $1,000 a month for her share of the $2,600 rent for their Bed-Stuy loft, and another $1,700 on her studio space in Dumbo.\n\nOver the last few years, she's steadily grown her art sales and income, which started around $50,000 a year when she first moved to the city, and last year exceeded $100,000. That's in part because one of her products — a $45 purse hook — took off late last year. She quickly sold out of her first 1,500 hooks, made of metal, glass, abalone shell, and mother-of-pearl, and designed to hang a bag from a restaurant table or bar. She recently dropped 2,000 more and hopes to make them a permanent part of her collection.\n\nDespite her recent windfall, budgeting is tricky with an income that varies dramatically month to month. \"I don't have family money to fall back on, or anyone to ask to borrow money from,\" she says.\n\nIt's taken a toll on Kinnare's social life, especially with friends who work corporate jobs and like to go out. She says she skips dinners out and has made a concerted effort to surround herself with other artists who understand the reality of having an unreliable income and the lifestyle that comes with it.\n\n\"Sometimes you blink your eyes and spend $100, and you're like, what just happened?\" she says. \"That's taken a lot of self-control to be able to find activities and things to do that don't require spending money.\"\n\nWhen factoring in the cost of living, New York creative workers like Kinnare earn about 23% less than the national average, a recent report by the nonprofit Center for an Urban Future found. A decade ago, they earned 15% less than the average. Much of that has to do with pricier real estate. With tighter living quarters in the city, many artists rent a separate studio space to work on their craft.\n\nFinding a studio space with enough room and natural light was even harder than finding an apartment, Kinnare says. When she was forced to move out of one studio on short notice, she struggled to find anything affordable on the market that had a window. So she resorted to messaging artists she didn't know on Instagram, asking for their landlords' contact information. \"It's a really, really fast game, and you have to be on top of it,\" she said.\n\nKinnare sees the high cost of living in New York City as an investment in her career that, so far, is paying off. She thinks it's easier to break into the art world than it was in LA, where she felt more professionally isolated.\n\n\"The art scene here is a lot more diverse and approachable,\" she said. \"I'm frequenting galleries a lot more, going to openings, going to shows, being in places where I want to be, networking and seeing and having the chance to talk to some of these people.\"\n\n\"The exposure here has been tenfold compared to what I've been used to,\" she added.\n\nLast year, she signed with a gallery after meeting their owners at a design fair and has since shown her work at multiple fairs with them.\n\nStill, the costs of breaking into the most dynamic creative scene in the country are high — and a growing number of creatives aren't making it. Many artists who left New York when COVID hit haven't returned. The number of New Yorkers working in the creative economy, including self-employed people, has dropped by about 6% since 2019, the Center for an Urban Future found. The city has lost nearly one-fifth of its dancers and film and video editors. More than a quarter of its fashion designers have disappeared.\n\nKinnare feels like one of the lucky ones. Her sales and social media following are growing, and she finally has some savings. One of her goals for 2026 is to give herself one day a week when she doesn't open her laptop or step inside the studio.\n\n\"I feel like I'm finally, after four years, at a place where I can breathe a little bit, but the grind never stops,\" she says. \"You can never get too comfortable.\"",

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees reportedly “checked in” on Dodgers free agent Michael Kopech this offseason, per the New York Post’s Jon Heyman.\n\nKopech entered free agency after spending a majority of 2025 on the injured list with the Dodgers. The reliever began the regular season on the injured list with a shoulder injury and transferred to the 60-day injured list at the beginning of May 2025.\n\nHe returned to the team the following month, but returned to the injured shortly after with a right knee injury. Kopech returned once again at the beginning of September, but re-aggravated his knee injury at the end of the season and missed the postseason.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Sign Brother of Current LA Starter to Minor League Deal\n\nThe right-hander joined the Dodgers at the trade deadline in 2024, switching to the National League from the Chicago White Sox.\n\nThe 29-year-old made an instant impact after arriving with the Dodgers, and became one of their most important weapons out of the bullpen. He had a 1.13 ERA with L.A. in 2024, and maintained a 3.00 ERA during their World Series charge in the playoffs.\n\nEven though he struggled with injury last season, the right-hander still performed will in 2025. He had a 2.45 ERA through 14 appearances with the Dodgers last season.\n\nThe Dodgers have already reinforced their bullpen this offseason so re-signing Kopech is unlikely, but whichever team grabs him will get a high-quality reliever for the upcoming season.\n\nThe post Dodgers World Series Champion Linked to Yankees appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "The WNBA and members of the WNBA Players Association will meet in New York on Monday to discuss the stalled collective bargaining negotiations, Kelsey Plum said on Friday after Unrivaled shootaround.",
    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA — The WNBA and members of the WNBA Players Association will meet in New York on Monday to discuss the stalled collective bargaining negotiations, Kelsey Plum said on Friday after Unrivaled shootaround.\n\nThe meeting will include members of the players union, the league’s CBA leadership, the legal team, members of the Labor Relations Committee and potentially other owners, a league source with knowledge of the discussions told Yahoo Sports, confirming the meeting.\n\nPlum said she and Naphessa Collier will attend since they can fly out after their early Unrivaled games on Sunday in Miami. Plum and Collier, who co-founded the offseason 3x3 league with Breanna Stewart, are both WNBPA vice presidents.\n\nIt is believed to be the first in-person meeting since shortly after the WNBA Finals concluded in October and the initial CBA deadline passed on Oct. 31. The league had reached out to the union for a couple of weeks now to put a meeting on the books, a source with knowledge of the talks told Yahoo Sports. Those requests were either ignored or declined until Thursday, the source said. Plum said to her knowledge, the meeting came together in recent days.\n\n“At the end of the day we’re human beings,” Plum said. “I think conversation face-to-face goes a long way, right? And you can understand body language, you can understand tone, you can understand all those type of things. And intent. And I just believe that eye contact is actually a massive thing that we forget.”\n\nPlayers, including Stewart, have said of late that they wanted such a meeting instead of working through lawyers. The league is proposing a revenue-sharing structure based on net revenue, whereas the union is proposing one based on gross revenue. There have been no new proposals in the new year after the latest extension expired on Jan. 9. A league source said the union submitted a proposal on Christmas Day that received no response, because it was essentially unchanged from the prior submission.\n\nNegotiations are continuing in a status quo period, with a moratorium passed on free agency to delay the massive movement expected when all but two of the veterans are unsigned. The league announced its 2026 schedule last week as talks hit the 15-month mark.\n\n“The thing is just sitting down and understanding the relationship and conversation, I think is No. 1, because let's be real, like when we play telephone with people in our own lives, a lot of times things can get scattered,” Plum said. “To be able to sit down face to face and say, ‘This is how I feel, this is how you feel, let's see what we can go from there.’”\n\nUnrivaled held practices in Philadelphia on Thursday ahead of the league’s first set of games outside of Miami. Players made available largely skirted away from CBA conversations, saying they’re focused on what they’re doing at Unrivaled or riding the line that they're unified as a player group. Tiffany Hayes said WNBPA executive director Terri Jackson met with players in Miami last week as they move toward the 100-days-out mark for the season to start on time on May 8.\n\nLexie Hull, a union representative for the Indiana Fever, said there is pressure as the timeline dwindles and media coverage increases over the lack of a deal.\n\n“People want a season,” Hull told reporters on Thursday. “We want a season. The league wants a season. And so that becomes just a much larger conversation. And I think that's what makes it feel like there's more pressure.”\n\nMessaging from the union has taken two tacks over the last year. Statements from the union and some players have followed hard, stern lines, with Satou Sabally calling an early proposal from the league a “slap in the face.” Others have been more nuanced and direct, describing small blips of progress, the need for compromise and a deal that benefits all.\n\nThat lack of unified messaging showed itself again on Friday, indicating schisms among the player base as they face a critical juncture.\n\nMinutes after Plum voiced optimism for an in-person meeting and exited the room in the halls of Xfinity Mobile Arena at the end of her media availability, Philadelphia native Natasha Cloud gave a much more fiery and animated retort, telling the crush of local TV media she was “disgusted with the W and how they’re handling this, and their lack of value, their lack of worth for us, their lack of even trying to attempt to move things with us.”\n\n“We will not f****** move until y'all move,” Cloud said, speaking directly into the closest camera. “And it would be the worst business decision of any business to not literally pay the players that make your business go. Without us, there is no W season. So the pressure is on the WNBA, on [Commissioner] Cathy [Engelbert], on [NBA Commissioner] Adam [Silver], on everyone that is in that front office. Do your job. Negotiate and pay your players, your workers.”\n\nAzurà Stevens, the Los Angeles Sparks player rep, spoke similarly, calling for new WNBA leadership and making clear she’s been preparing for a strike. She said she was not aware of an in-person meeting on Monday.\n\n“I feel like this is ridiculous that we’re waiting this long anyways,” Stevens said. “I just think this all needs to be over. We need to come to something and we either need to play or we don’t. It’s getting dragged out, and it’s honestly just frustrating at this point.”",

Some of the building’s doors were damaged. No weapons were discovered in Sohail’s car.\n\nSohail's father told the New York Daily News Thursday that his son had been considering converting to Judaism and that he had struggled with “mental problems.” The Forward, a media outlet centered on Jewish issues, interviewed a rabbi in New Jersey who said Sohail attended a Purim service at Chabad last year and visited two other times, looking for spiritual guidance.\n\n“I was able to talk to him for a few minutes and see that he’s not exactly stable,” Rabbi Levi Azimov told the Forward. Another rabbi at a Jewish school in Carteret, New Jersey, where Sohail lived, told the Forward he had dropped by for afternoon prayers on Tuesday but began yelling about feeling let down by Chabad after the service.\n\nThe crash occurred on the 75th anniversary of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson becoming the leader of the Lubavitch movement and prompted immediate concern in the city. Mayor Zohran Mamdani and the city's police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, rushed to the scene to brief the media, with officials announcing increased security around houses of worship across the city.\n\n“This is deeply alarming, especially given the deep meaning and the history of the institution to so many in New York and around the world,\" Mamdani said. “And on today of all days.”\n\nThe Chabad Lubavitch headquarters and synagogue in Brooklyn draws thousands of visitors each year. There is a near constant police presence around the complex.",

She started all 36 games for the Wildcats last season in its Sweet Sixteen run, averaging over eight points per game and shooting 40.2%.\n\nThe Big 12 foes clashed back and forth throughout the first half, with neither team ever pulling away. Colorado led by just four at the end of the second quarter.\n\nThe Buffaloes looked to finally pull ahead with 5:38 left in the third off a Jade Masogayo three-pointer to lead by eight. However, the ‘Cats clawed back and kept it within four with ten to go.\n\nK-State looked to gain some momentum in the fourth quarter. A Brandie Harrod and-one gave K-State a three-point advantage with 7:33 to go.\n\nTied with under six remaining, Walker nailed a three-pointer to take back the lead for the Buffaloes. Colorado never looked back and extended its lead to nine by the final buzzer.\n\nColorado defeats the Wildcats 56-47.\n\nFreshman guard Jordan Speiser came off the bench and led the Wildcats in scoring with 12, including going 8-8 from the free-throw line. Senior guard Tess Heal missed her second game for the Wildcats, as she still awaits word from the NCAA regarding her violation.\n\nThe game extends K-State’s skid to two after losing to rival KU 83-61 in Lawrence Sunday.\n\nThe Wildcats look to get back above .500 in Tempe, Arizona, this Sunday against the Arizona State Sun Devils.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees and Paul Goldschmidt haven't figured out his free agency yet.\n\nBut they're still trying to line something up, and the latest updates are positive.\n\nThe New York Post's Jon Heyman reported this on Thursday:\n\n\"Paul Goldschmidt seems willing to return to the Yankees, even as something less than a full-time player. The Yankees are over the top tax threshold now, so they’d have to squeeze Goldy into the payroll. Goldschmidt makes sense since the Yankees still aren’t sold on Jasson Domínguez batting right-handed and Goldy is better defensively at 1B than Ben Rice.\"\n\nMORE: How Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nGoldschmidt seems willing to be just the short-side platoon guy that plays first base against left-handed pitching.\n\nIf he's really willing to do that, the Yanks should go after him.\n\nGoldschmidt played for the Yankees in 2025 for the first time. He turned 38 years old in September.\n\nGoldschmidt is a seven-time All Star and a former MVP.\n\nIn his career, he's a .288 hitter with an .884 OPS and 372 home runs.\n\nMORE: Paul Skenes has added a new pitch\n\nGoldschmidt signed with the Yankees on a one-year, $12.5 million deal before the 2025 season.\n\nFor the Yanks, Goldy batted .274 with a .731 OPS. Just against lefties, though, his OPS was .981.\n\nThat'll definitely work if the Yankees could get production like that out of Goldy one more time.\n\nTeam USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nHow Trent Grisham's decision ruined the Yankees' offseason plans\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nBo Bichette comments exhibit clear hyprocrisy\n\nAndrew McCutchen is not happy with the Pirates",

    "fullText": "A powerful coastal storm is expected to develop this weekend, and forecasters say its track will determine whether New York City sees accumulating snow or largely avoids impacts, with confidence highest for a system forming off the Carolinas.\n\nFOX 5 NY Meteorologist Mike Woods warns a slight shift closer to the coast could bring a major nor’easter, while a farther-offshore track would limit snowfall for much of the tri-state area.\n\nThe storm could rapidly strengthen into a bomb cyclone, a rare intensification process that can produce heavy snow, damaging winds and dangerous travel conditions as Arctic air remains locked over the Northeast.\n\nNEW YORK CITY - More winter weather may be on the way as forecasters track a potential weekend snowstorm that could strengthen into a major nor’easter.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) says confidence is growing that a powerful coastal storm will develop late this week, with the potential to bring snow, strong winds and bitter cold to the New York City area.\n\nSKIP TO: PREDICTIONS | FORECAST | BOMB CYCLONE | 5 DAY | LIVE WEATHER\n\nHowever, small changes in the storm’s track could make a big difference in who sees accumulating snow — and how much. Here's the latest on the storm.\n\nFOX 5 NY Meteorologist Mike Woods says the region needs to watch the storm closely.\n\nStay connected with FOX LOCAL. For winter storm coverage—Download Now.\n\n\"If it’s a little further offshore, we’re left with less of an impact,\" Woods said. \"But if it’s a little closer to us, we could have a major nor’easter on our hands.\"\n\n❄️ Winter Storm Likely This Weekend ❄️\n\nConfidence has increased, particularly across the Carolinas and southern Virginia, for impactful snowfall beginning as early as Friday night. More uncertainty remains for areas north along the East Coast. Stay tuned for more updates! pic.twitter.com/KT1UiNH6Dy\n\n— NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) January 28, 2026\n\nWith a cold weather advisory in effect due to Arctic air already locked in place, conditions could support snow across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.\n\nFOX 5 NY's meteorologist Mike Woods says the region needs to watch the storm closely.\n\n\"If it’s a little farther offshore, we’re left with less of an impact,\" Woods said. \"But if it’s a little closer to us, we could have a major nor’easter on our hands.\"\n\nWoods says some forecast models currently show snow reaching parts of the tri-state area, particularly the Jersey Shore and the eastern end of Long Island, late Saturday into Sunday.\n\nOther scenarios keep the storm farther offshore, limiting impacts for the city. Forecasters emphasize that the exact track of the storm remains uncertain. Even a shift of 50 to 100 miles could change precipitation types, snowfall totals or whether some areas see little to no snow at all.\n\nForecast guidance suggests snow could begin as early as Friday night in parts of the Southeast before spreading north.\n\nThe setup includes very cold air already in place across the Northeast, combined with a developing coastal storm that could pull moisture northward. Woods notes that temperatures will trend colder over the next several days, not warmer.\n\n\"We’ve got more shots of Arctic air coming through,\" he said. \"That’s why temperatures are actually going down instead of up.\"\n\nWind chill advisories are already in effect across parts of the region, with feels-like temperatures dipping below zero in some areas.\n\nFOX Weather says the developing storm has a strong likelihood of rapidly intensifying, a process known as \"bombing out,\" which could turn it into a bomb cyclone. Forecast models suggest the storm’s central pressure could drop dramatically as it moves offshore, a sign of rapid strengthening.\n\nHowever, where that intensification occurs remains uncertain. Meteorologists stress that the storm is still several days away, and multiple scenarios remain on the table.\n\nA bomb cyclone forms through a process called bombogenesis, which occurs when a storm’s central pressure drops at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, according to FOX Weather.\n\nForecasters say a pronounced dip in the jet stream is reinforcing cold air across much of the eastern United States while steering the storm farther south before it turns north.\n\nA strong upper-level disturbance is expected to become embedded in the jet stream late this week, helping trigger the development of low pressure off the East Coast.\n\nWith cold air already in place, that combination raises the risk for snow if the storm moves close enough to the region.\n\nMeteorologists say updates over the next several days will be critical in determining the storm’s impact on New York City and the surrounding area.\n\nThe biggest question remains the storm’s path after it moves through the Carolinas, with forecast models split on whether it will track far enough north to bring another weekend snow to the Northeast.\n\nWednesday: Bitterly cold but dry. Arctic air remains in place with sunshine and strong wind chills making it feel well below freezing across the tri-state area.\n\nThursday: Continued cold with increasing clouds. No precipitation expected, but the cold air sets the stage for potential weekend impacts.\n\nFriday: Clouds increase as a coastal storm begins to organize off the Southeast coast. Snow develops across parts of the Carolinas and southern Virginia by Friday night. Conditions remain cold locally with precipitation still uncertain for NYC.\n\nSaturday: Storm system moves north along the East Coast. Snow is possible in parts of New Jersey, Long Island and coastal areas, depending on the storm’s track. New York City remains in a \"wait-and-see\" zone.\n\nSunday: Potential for lingering snow, wind and cold if the storm tracks closer to the coast. A farther offshore track would limit impacts, while a closer path could bring a nor’easter with strong winds and accumulating snow.\n\nStay ahead of the snow with FOX 5’s expert meteorologists, streaming LIVE on FOX LOCAL.

In nine games, he threw for 1,259 yards and only 7 touchdowns.\n\nNew York will likely be looking for a new starting quarterback this offseason, and CBS Sports NFL writer Joel Corry thinks the Jets could move Fields this offseason.\n\n“The Jets signed Fields to a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million fully guaranteed as an unrestricted free agent last March in the hopes that he would be more than a bridge quarterback,” Corry wrote on Wednesday. “Fields’ preseason struggles were dismissed rather than seen as a warning sign after he played well against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular season opener.\n\n“It was downhill for the 2021 first-round pick after the Steelers game. Fields had a dubious distinction in a Week 6 loss to the Broncos. He was sacked nine times in producing a franchise-worst minus-10 net passing yards. Fields was benched nine games into the season.”\n\nThere’s a possibility that the Steelers could reunite with Fields this offseason, especially if Aaron Rodgers doesn’t come back.

    "description": "After college, my partner and I moved to New York City to live together and start our careers. I had no idea how much I'd miss living with my friends.",
    "fullText": "I still remember pulling out of the driveway of the house I'd shared with the same five girls for three years.\n\nI sat in the passenger seat, waving goodbye as my boyfriend drove away. We both cried, unable to fathom that college was really over.\n\nAs we road-tripped from Ann Arbor, Michigan, back to the Northeast (where we're both from), we felt excited for the next chapter of our lives — starting our careers in New York City and moving in together. But we were also going through our own forms of a breakup, just not with each other.\n\nMy housemates and I weren't just housemates. We were pandemic-era housemates, meaning we ate breakfast together at our tiny kitchen table every morning and took our remote classes from the same living room couch.\n\nMy boyfriend had a similar experience, living with friends in a house around the corner from mine.\n\nSomewhere along the way, both of our friend groups became like family, barging into each other's houses without notice and spending endless hours together.\n\nI had no idea just how much I'd miss that.\n\nJust one month after graduation, I had a cute, albeit tiny, apartment in Manhattan with swanky restaurants on each corner, a pickleball court nearby, and 24/7 access to pizza and bagels. And I was doing it all with my boyfriend by my side.\n\nI had achieved the dream so many Long Island-raised kids like myself had growing up.\n\nBut as much as I tried to romanticize my compact kitchen appliances and lack of windows (and consequently, sunlight), I longed for sunny days on my front porch in Ann Arbor with my five best friends sipping lattes out of mason jars, talking about absolutely nothing.\n\nMy boyfriend missed his version of this, too, sipping bottles of beer with his five housemates, talking mostly about football.\n\nWe both longed to be somewhere else. And I, for one, felt guilty.\n\nStruggling to adjust to our 9-to-5 schedules in a new city, we often found ourselves sitting around the apartment, lacking the energy to do all the fun things we used to love.\n\nI did make some new friends, but I struggled to put in the effort to maintain them. I often wondered if it was even possible to find the same level of friendship I had with my college housemates.\n\nI'd replay the highlight reel of memories in my mind — prank wars that would last for weeks, communicating with our next-door neighbors via handwritten signs taped to our windows, and nights in watching old One Direction music videos.\n\nAlthough we still kept in touch via our group chat, it just wasn't the same as waking up every morning to all my favorite people in one place.\n\nIt was as if I'd been living in my very own sitcom for three years — one that could never be recreated — with the perfect mix of characters, all in the right place at the right time.\n\nAnd like all sitcoms, it had to come to an end. I was holding out hope for a spinoff, but I had to let go.\n\nI realized that what I really needed most was time. There wasn't one thing in particular that magically made me stop missing my friends so much. It took about a year to adapt to my new routine and start feeling like myself again.\n\nIn the meantime, I let myself be sad, and I stopped feeling guilty about it. I leaned on the one person who understood my sadness on a personal level: my boyfriend.\n\nWe talked about missing our best friends, Ann Arbor, and our life together before we moved to New York City. It felt good to have someone who was going through the same thing.\n\nSlowly but surely, we adjusted to our new reality and started finding joy in the little things, like decorating our apartment, trying new bagel spots, and perfecting homemade vodka sauce.\n\nAs for my housemates, we continue to find unique ways to stay in touch. We partake in our own Secret Santa each year. We email each other life updates through personalized newsletters that are way too detailed. We schedule visits throughout the year and meet up around the country. Every time we do, it's like we're back home.\n\nOf course, I still miss them. But I've learned to cherish the people that are nearby — both new friends I've met in the city and old ones I grew up with back on Long Island. I've also made more of an effort to spend time with family. Thankfully, they're only a train ride away.\n\nTwo and a half years postgrad, my boyfriend and I still live together, but now we have a new apartment with a full-sized oven and more windows to let in plenty of sunlight.\n\nWe see our best friends a few times a year and spend the remaining 300-and-something days trying to convince them all to move to New York. And in the meantime, we've built a life we're happy with.",

    "description": ", Jonathan Landay and Matt Spetalnick NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence reports have raised doubts about whether interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez will cooperate",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence reports have raised doubts about whether interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez will cooperate with the Trump administration by formally cutting ties with U.S. adversaries, four people familiar with the reports said in recent days.\n\nU.S. officials have ​said publicly they want the interim president to sever relations with close international allies like Iran, China and Russia, including expelling their diplomats and advisers from Venezuela.\n\nBut ‌Rodriguez, whose swearing-in ceremony was attended by representatives of those countries early this month, has yet to publicly announce such a move. She became president after the U.S. captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3.\n\nThe ‌U.S. intelligence reports said it was not clear if she is fully on board with the U.S. strategy in her country, according to the sources, who declined to be identified by name.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe traveled on January 15 to Caracas, where he discussed the country's political future with Rodriguez. Reuters could not determine if those conversations changed the intelligence agencies' opinion.\n\nWashington wants to rein in its foes' influence in the Western hemisphere, including in Venezuela, where Trump seeks to exploit the OPEC nation’s vast oil reserves.\n\nIf Rodriguez were to break ties with the U.S. rivals, ⁠it would open more opportunity for U.S. investment in Venezuela’s ‌energy sector. But failure to control Rodriguez could undercut Washington’s efforts to direct the country’s interim rulers from afar and avoid a deeper U.S. military role.\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency and the Venezuela government did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAsked for comment, a senior Trump administration official, who ‍declined to be identified, said U.S. President Donald Trump \"continues to exert maximum leverage\" over Venezuela's leaders and \"expects this cooperation to continue.\"\n\nThe CIA has previously assessed that officials loyal to Maduro, including Rodriguez, were best positioned to govern the country following his ouster.\n\nBut critics of Trump's Venezuela strategy have expressed doubts about the wisdom of keeping Maduro's loyalists in place as the country's interim leaders. The concerns ​about Rodriguez' reliability were present prior to the U.S. military operation, said two sources.\n\nFor Venezuela, the U.S. directive means abandoning its closest allies outside the region. Iran has ‌helped Venezuela repair oil refineries while China has taken oil as repayment for debt. Russia has supplied weaponry, including missiles, to Venezuela's military.\n\nTrump has also cited communist-led Cuba as another U.S. foe he wants Venezuela to abandon. Havana has provided security and intelligence support while receiving cut-rate Venezuelan oil.\n\nSince Maduro's removal, Rodriguez, whose deep ties to the oil sector are crucial to keeping the country stable, has taken steps to stay in favor with Washington including releasing political prisoners and authorizing the sale of 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States.\n\nIn a speech on Sunday, Rodriguez said she has had “enough” of U.S. intervention. Still, U.S. officials have also held positive calls with her in recent days, according ⁠to two of the sources.\n\nThe Trump administration does not see an immediate alternative to working with Rodriguez, ​given it has publicly backed her so strongly, two of the sources said.\n\nBut U.S. officials are developing ​contacts with senior military and security officials in case they decide to change their approach, a source briefed on Venezuela policy said.\n\nMACHADO CONSIDERED A LONGER-TERM OPTION TO RUN VENEZUELA\n\nThe recent intelligence reports also found that opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is not currently able to run the country successfully ‍in part because she lacks strong ties to ⁠the country’s security services or oil sector, the sources said.\n\nSome observers and Machado's movement say it won a 2024 election that year by a huge margin, though the state backed a Maduro victory. She remains popular with Venezuelans.\n\nTrump told reporters last week he wanted Machado “involved” in the country’s leadership, without providing details.\n\nOne person familiar with ⁠the administration’s discussions with Machado said she is well-liked by the White House and is considered a longer-term option for a leadership position in Venezuela.\n\nThe separate source briefed on Venezuela policy suggested that for now, Machado ‌could be considered for an advisory role but no firm decision had been made. Representatives for Machado did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Erin Banco, Jonathan Landay and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Don Durfee and Cynthia Osterman)",

    "description": "A WFAN host argues that the New York Giants should sign WR Odell Beckham Jr., reuniting him with head coach John Harbaugh.",
    "fullText": "Following the New York Giants' hiring of John Harbaugh, the top head coaching candidate on the market, excitement surrounds the changes the Giants will make this offseason.\n\nHarbaugh has already begun overhauling the coaching staff, bringing in several coaches he previously worked with during his time with the Baltimore Ravens. With free agency approaching, many have speculated about Ravens free agents who could follow their former head coach to New York.\n\nThere may also be interest in targeting free agents who previously played for both the Giants and Harbaugh, such as Kevin Zeitler, Jihad Ward, or even former star receiver Odell Beckham Jr.\n\nWFAN's Tommy Lugauer believes a reunion with Beckham is something the Giants should explore.\n\nTommy calls for the Giants to bring back Odell Beckham Jr:@tommylugauer pic.twitter.com/i9TRz55iBu\n\n— WFAN Sports Radio (@WFAN660) January 27, 2026\n\n\"So here's my suggestion. A wide receiver that is no stranger to the Giants, a wide receiver that is no stranger to John Harbaugh. A wide receiver that has already had a conversation with Jaxson Dart about John Harbaugh,\" he said. \"And that man's name is Odell Beckham Jr. That's right. OBJ reuniting in New York in a different role than he had in his previous stop, where he was the number one wide receiver, the playmaker. Now as a grizzled vet, a guy that's won a championship, has been around the block -- a chance to come back home.\n\n\"A chance to reunite not only with the Giants but with John Harbaugh, and be a valued wide receiver and playmaker for young Jaxson Dart and a young Giants offense. So there's already a relationship with Harbaugh and OBJ. There's obviously a relationship with Beckham and the Giants. Many were sad when he was sent away, when he was traded off. Now here's the opportunity for the reunion. So Joe Schoen, John Harbaugh -- make it happen. Odell Beckham Jr. back with the Giants.\"\n\nA Beckham-Giants reunion has been discussed for years following the trade that sent the former first-round pick to the Cleveland Browns. Beckham was one of the franchise's most popular players in recent memory, and he has certainly shown interest in returning to the Giants before his career ends.\n\nAs much fun as the reunion may be, it is certainly questionable how much production Beckham could add as a playmaker at 33 years old.\n\nHe last played in 2024 with the Miami Dolphins, appearing in nine games and hauling in just nine catches for 55 yards. Beckham also played for Harbaugh and the Ravens in 2023, when he racked up over 500 yards and three touchdowns on 35 receptions.\n\nWith the Giants relying heavily on the return of Malik Nabers and many questions surrounding the wide receiver corps beyond him, Beckham could provide veteran leadership for his fellow LSU alumnus to learn from and someone the young receivers can lean on during Nabers' recovery from injury.\n\nBeckham, of course, also suffered a pair of ACL tears in his post-Giants career, including one in Super Bowl LVI, where he scored the game's first touchdown, helping the Rams secure the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nBeckham has previously expressed interest in continuing his career, and finishing it in a Giants uniform could be just what he needs. However, it would have to make sense for the Giants, who would need to feel confident in Beckham's ability to help the team at this stage of his career.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Should New York Giants reunite Odell Beckham Jr. with John Harbaugh?",

    "description": "This is the Maryland Minute, a short story followed by a roundup of Terps-related news.",
    "fullText": "Current New York Giants head coach John Harbaugh will forever be linked with the DMV after his long tenure as coach of the Baltimore Ravens. And those ties shone through over the weekend.\n\nHarbaugh’s first official hire as Giants head coach was bringing in former Maryland cornerback and safety Dennard Wilson to be the team’s defensive coordinator.\n\nThe 44-year-old played 42 games for the Terps between 2000-2003, finishing his senior year as team captain and an honorable mention all-ACC pick. He was also a graduate assistant for the Terps from 2007-2008, after getting his start as defensive backs coach at DeMatha High School.\n\nWilson was formerly defensive backs coach for the Ravens in 2023 — where he and Harbaugh truly connected — and defensive backs coach and passing coordinator for the Philadelphia Eagles from 2020-2022.\n\nMost recently and most notably, though, he was the defensive coordinator for the Tennessee Titans from 2024-25.\n\nUnder Wilson’s leadership in 2024, the Titans finished second in the league in total defense and passing defense — their highest ranks since 2000. This year, the Titans were ranked 21st in the league.\n\nSeveral around the Giants organization had incredibly good things to say about Wilson, who chose the Giants after also interviewing with the Los Angeles Chargers for the same role.\n\n“When asking those guys if they thought Dennard had coordinator potential, both of the men said, ‘no, this is a head coach”@Connor_J_Hughes breaks down the hiring of the Giants new defensive coordinator Dennard Wilson: pic.twitter.com/Jcz3A2GTbn\n\n— Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) January 25, 2026\n\nInterestingly, the Giants looked to hire Wilson to be their defensive coordinator in 2024, when he chose the Titans’ job over New York.\n\nNow, he’ll have to turn around a defense that has several talented pieces, including fellow Maryland alums Deonte Banks and Beau Brade, but finished 28th in the NFL in total defense last season.\n\nMaryland had a men’s basketball game Saturday.

    "fullText": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) this weekend accused Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of applying a stark double standard in her comments made after the killing of Alex Pretti by a federal agent during an anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis, the second such death in the city this month.\n\nIn one part of an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, which has gone viral with almost 3 million views on one X post alone, Ocasio-Cortez sharply criticized Noem’s suggestion that people should not attend protests with firearms, arguing the stance clashes with the Trump administration and conservatives’ fawning over previous armed protesters on the political right.\n\nPolitics: Kristi Noem Slips Up With Awkward Typo In Heated Post About Immigrants In Minneapolis\n\nPretti was a legal gun owner who was licensed to carry a concealed weapon. Minnesota law allows permit holders to carry firearms in public, including at protests. The government’s claim that he was armed and provoking violence is at odds with videos and witness statements circulating publicly.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said: “How rich is it that she is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person’s death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and the same administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse?”\n\n“When she [Noem] is talking about how merely showing up and inciting violence based on ideology against the government, when this administration has pardoned hundreds of Jan. 6th rioters who have then gone out into the streets and recommitted crimes of violence over and over again,” she continued.\n\nThe New York Democrat argued the message that is being sent is solely political: “What Secretary Noem is saying is not that you can’t do these things, is not that you can’t be armed, is not that you can’t attack your government. She just thinks that you can’t do that based on your political affiliation.”\n\nPolitics: 'I Can't Watch': Trump Fires Off Unexpected Whine At The Worst Possible Time\n\nThe lawmaker also warned: “The uncorking of chaos that this administration is trying to attempt against the American people is escalatory, it is dangerous and it is a complete abdication of leadership.”\n\n“We cannot go down this road,” Ocasio-Cortez added. “We cannot have countrymen against countrymen, citizen against citizen. This is not the America that we believe in. It is not the America that we stand in and we must unite together against this kind of very dangerous splintering that they are seeking to incite against people and divide us.”\n\nEconomist Sounds Alarm On Damage Trump Is Quietly Doing To The Economy\n\nKash Patel’s Viral Line About Protesters Sparks Anger Online\n\nMelania Trump Told To 'Read The Room' Over Documentary Stunt",

    "description": "Some housing markets have a luxury tier that's far higher than the rest of home prices. Miami tops New York City for the most $1 million listings.",
    "fullText": "The lifestyles of the rich and famous sometimes seem so far out of reach.\n\nWith homes selling for upward of $50 million and billionaires building compounds to disallow regular folks from taking a glance at luxury, one end of the real estate market seems to be growing exponentially.\n\nThose enormous price tags can be jarring when looking for a home, but in reality, the median price of a luxury home is far lower. The entry point of luxury, which is defined as the 90th percentile of listing prices, was $1.19 million in December, according to Realtor.com. That price was about three times the national median home listing price of $399,950.\n\nBut there are some places where luxury, mega-luxury, and standard homes exist side-by-side. While that may seem concerning for those who are looking for affordable homes, these different markets don't always impact each other.\n\n\"Big gaps between luxury and typical home prices aren't automatically a warning sign,\" Realtor.com senior economist Anthony Smith said. \"They often point to markets that are highly segmented, where luxury behaves differently from the rest of the housing market. In those places, even small shifts at the high end can create noticeable changes in luxury pricing without spilling over to the median home price.\"\n\nFlorida, for example, has five metros that ranked in the top 10 on Realtor.com's list of places with the widest luxury gaps in real estate, partially fueled by high-net-worth individuals moving to Florida recently. Miami specifically dethroned the New York City metro area as the city with the most $1 million-plus listings in the country. The influx of high net worth individuals into Miami is also significantly linked to an exodus from the New York metro area: Realtor noted that 26.3% of the Miami metro's demand originates from the New York metro.\n\nThere will always be gaps in the housing market separating one sector from the next. But some luxury markets differ greatly from the sector below.\n\nHere are the top 10 metros where the luxury sector is the most disconnected from the typical market, according to Realtor.com.",

    "title": "From ‘Bono’ to ‘Bozo’ already? Just let NY Giants coach John Harbaugh do his work",
    "description": "Some are already irate over choices the Giants’ new head coach is making about his assistant coaches.",
    "fullText": "It is amazing how quickly the opinions of some fans can change. And, how small things no one has any idea ill prove to be right or wrong can be the cause.\n\nWhen John Harbaugh, a Super Bowl-winning head coach with 12 playoff appearances in 18 years as head coach of the Baltimore Ravens was hired less than two weeks, there was nearly absolute joy in Giants Nation. In our poll asking if hiring Harbaugh was the right decision, 95.21% (5,227) of 5,490 voters said it was.\n\nThere were comments like these:\n\nHarbaugh and Dart will deliver us another SB, I truly believe that\n\nDart’s retiring with more rings than Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson combined. Book it.\n\nI haven’t seen Big Blue Viewers this aligned on a decision in my life. May the next decade be one of redemption.\n\nNo other hiring would have been met with the excitement, or brought the instant credibility that Harbaugh did. The Giants have been flailing for more than a decade now, going mostly in the wrong direction. Harbaugh offers them the best chance for a course correction.\n\nHe comes from a winning environment that he was a big part of establishing and maintaining. He brings with him knowledge of how the Ravens have been consistently good, and the cachet to get ideas implemented with the Giants. We are already seeing some of that take place. He brings a reputation with him for having a keen eye for finding quality young assistant coaches who could help set the organization up for sustained success.\n\nOn the field and in the locker room, Harbaugh is a culture-setting CEO type head coach who brings the ability — and credibility — to set standards and hold players accountable. The Giants, and the entire organization, desperately need that.\n\nRemember John Mara warning Brian Daboll after he won Coach of the Year honors for the 2022 season that it wasn’t hard to go from ‘Bono’ to ‘Bozo’ in the New York/New Jersey market?\n\nWell, when he was introduced as the team’s head coach last Tuesday, Harbaugh was clearly ‘Bono.’ Maybe the Beatles. In a more modern reference, perhaps Taylor Swift.\n\nToday, there are already fans throwing darts at him.\n\nFirst, Harbaugh had the temerity to send Carmen Bricillo, a popular, effective offensive line coach, packing. That led to comments like these:\n\nThis sucks especially if George Warhop is the guy to take over. Nice guy in his 60’s with lots of oline coaching experience. Unfortunately heading up many underwhelming lines.\n\nThis is a questionable move at best. I just don’t understand why he wouldn’t stay — especially since he was under contract for another year and has proven that he can work wonders with what he’s given. I also find it strange since Jack Harbaugh gave a ringing endorsement and told him to keep him. I don’t understand this at all.\n\nSo there was no bigger supporter of the JH acquisition than MaineG1…. But this is a major disappointment! I don’t understand the reason behind fixing something that’s been so horribly wrong for such a long time under any circumstance. For anyone making claims that this is just minor move and, there’s no reason for concern. You obviously haven’t been paying attention over the last 10 years. Before Bricillo, the offensive line was one of the 3 worst in NFL history.\n\nI can’t understand that Harbaugh looked at that man’s resume and came to the conclusion he could get someone better? Direct disciple of Dante Scarnecchia. Plus the job he did with the Raiders. Who by the way, were an absolute shit show just slightly less terrible than the steaming pile of dung the Giants had been trotting out over the past decade.\n\nI was also a fan of Patterson, but the run defense over the last 3 years has been dreadful…. So letting him go makes sense, but, Bricillo is a head scratcher. I also hope the plan isn’t to bring in the Oline coach from the Ravens? For those who don’t know? Joe D passed away at the beginning of the season and, was replaced by George Warhop. He was the offensive line coach for the 49ers and, Bucs I believe in the early 2000s. For the most part those lines were terrible…. 2024 under Joe D, the offensive line was really good. 2025 under Warhop, absolutely shitty. This can’t be the way.\n\nThen, Harbaugh went and hired a defensive coordinator some fans think is terrible.\n\nAnother bad Tennessee DC. I have, misgivings.\n\nOkay, it was a mistake to hire Harbaugh. Everything is going to hell. Fire Schoen. The Mara’s should be forced to sell the team. Trade Dart for draft picks. Burn it to the ground.\n\nWas hoping this was not true. Here’s his report card for his last season :\n\nTotal Defense Rank: 21st in yards, 28th in points\n\nOpponent Points: 478 allowed (28th)\n\nWay to really go for excellence Coach! Forget the guy coaching in the AFC championship or the passing coordinator in one of the most complex, vicious, aggressive modern defenses. Let’s get a guy who managed to coach a 3 win teams defense to the 28th ranking.\n\nWe really managed to grab a guy from one of the only programs worse than ours, who has no idea what winning looks like, who’s defense just Barely ranked better than Shane Bowen and Bullen…? Just fking wow.\n\nLosing Bricillo and Patterson this week coupled with this latest absurd hire, It’s been a very bad week for John harbaugh.\n\nHopefully he can at least get Monken in here.\n\nFolks around here acting like Harbs just hired Shane Bowen again!\n\nGiants fans last weekend – Give Harbaugh whatever he wants, just get him signed! In Harbaugh we trust!!!\n\nGiants fans this weekend – What??? He hired a different guy than the one I wanted?? Harbaugh out!!!\n\nHarbaugh was never going to make every decision you or I would have made. Yes, I was hoping he would keep Carmen Bricillo as offensive line coach. He didn’t. So be it. There will be more decisions you don’t like. Harbaugh will be right about some, wrong about others. Probably, he will be right far more often than he is wrong.\n\nHarbaugh has an 18-year body of really successful work with the Baltimore Ravens and a Rolodex compiled over something like four decades of coaching that earned him a five-year, $100 million contract and the ability to make the decisions he wants to make.\n\nHarbaugh is the best, most capable, most qualified person the Giants have hired on their coaching staff or in their front office since they let Tom Coughlin go after the 2015 season.\n\nHe knows what he wants in an offensive line coach. He knows plenty of people who could tell him what he wanted to know about Bricillo’s work, and his coaching style. He met with Bricillo himself. He decided Bricillo wasn’t the right coach for what he wanted. I would rather have him make that choice than keep a coach on staff he wasn’t certain about to appease the fan base, or the offensive linemen.\n\nMaybe Harbaugh will hire George Warhop, a long-time NFL offensive line coach who was with him in Baltimore the last two seasons. Maybe he will hire someone else. Maybe it will turn out well. Maybe it won’t.\n\nWhen it comes to Wilson, again Harbaugh is far more qualified to make this decision and knows far more about Wilson than any of us.\n\nYou can simply point to the 2025 statistics that showed Wilson’s Tennessee defense 28th in points and 21st in yardage allowed, and decide he is a terrible coach and a terrible hire. Or, you can look deeper.\n\nYou can look back at 2024, his first season. His bio on the Titans’ website, which likely won’t be available much longer, includes this:\n\nDuring Wilson’s first year in Tennessee, the Titans ranked second overall in total defense (311.2 opponent yards per game)—the team’s highest ranking since leading the NFL in total defense in 2000. The 2024 Titans also finished second in passing defense (177.3), which also was their best ranking since 2000 (first). Wilson’s defense tied for the fifth-fewest first downs allowed per game (18.5) and tied for the fifth-fewest opponent yards allowed per play (5.2) in 2024.\n\nYou can trust ESPN Titans beat writer Turron Davenport, who told me recently that Wilson “wasn’t given much to work with” in 2025 but did a good job.\n\nYou can trust Pro Bowl defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons, who wanted Wilson to stay in Tennessee.\n\nJeffery Simmons understands it's not up to him BUT if he has it his way, he'd love to have Dennard Wilson back with the #Titans. pic.twitter.com/Kc4Qhxurko\n\n— TURRON DAVENPORT (@TDavenport_NFL) December 31, 2025\n\nYou can trust Jimmy Morris of SB Nation’s Music City Miracles, who wrote this recently predicting Wilson would land with the Giants:\n\nWilson did a really good job with the Titans this year. The numbers weren’t great, but you have to account for the fact that all three of his starting corners were either traded or injured for most of the season. He also had zero EDGE presence for the entire year.\n\nI thought that Wilson would land as the defensive coordinator for John with the New York Giants. He might still, but it would be surprising if he took the Chargers interview with Jim, knowing he could get the Giants job with John.\n\nThe Giants brought in Harbaugh because of his record of success. He is, naturally, going to want to bring in people he knows and has had success with.\n\nMaybe at least wait until the Giants blow a fourth-quarter lead next fall because of a decision Harbaugh makes that backfires before thinking he is a Bozo.",
