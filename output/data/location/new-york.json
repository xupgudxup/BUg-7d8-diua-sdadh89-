Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nA potential New York bidding war could be forming around Kyle Tucker, and if the market goes that way, the New York Yankees and New York Mets could find themselves battling it out.\n\nEarly predictions had Tucker in the $400 million range, but as the offseason has unfolded, that no longer feels safe to say, and that matters for two teams that are always willing to spend some money when it matters most.\n\nTucker is still viewed as one of the best players in baseball. He impacts the game on both sides of the baseball, can really swing it, and fits most lineups.\n\nFor the Yankees, he’d provide another middle-of-the-order presence with Aaron Judge. For the Mets, he’d represent another franchise bat to pair with Juan Soto.\n\nBoth New York teams have shown a willingness to spend, and both could use a player of his caliber after disappointing years a season ago.\n\nAccording to Jon Heyman, both squads have checked in on the left-handed hitting slugger.\n\n“Though he might not reach the early $400M predictions after his typically excellent but ultimately unsatisfying platform season with the Cubs, the all-around star (he, Mookie Betts, Aaron Judge, Juan Soto and José Ramírez are the only players to post a 4 WAR the past five seasons) should still be worth $300M-plus based on past deals and comps. But if he doesn’t mind resetting, the Dodgers could become an option for a short term and high AAV. The Yankees and Mets (and all big-market teams) have checked in, but Cody Bellinger’s versatility and lower price tag make him the New York mark — at least for now,” he wrote.\n\nIf Tucker’s asking price continues to come down, don’t be surprised if New York City turns into the center of his free-agency race.\n\nKyle Tucker now viewed as ‘fallback option’ for Yankees amid Cody Bellinger rumors\n\nAmid Jazz Chisholm rumors, Yankees predicted to sign Blue Jays’ Bo Bichette to $180 million contract\n\nRed Sox have shown interest in an All-Star the Yankees have been linked to in trade talks\n\nMariners reportedly willing to move top prospects for Yankees trade target, possibly take New York out of contention\n\nCubs predicted to make a deal for former Yankees dud and Blue Jays infielder who ruined World Series\n\nEx-Yankees fan favorite and top prospect linked to American League contender after hitting .318 last season",

    "description": "Former Arizona Cardinals head coach will apparently get a look from New York.",
    "fullText": "Kliff Kingsbury is leaving his job as Washington Commanders offensive coordinator to “pursue other opportunities.” One of those opportunities is likely to be with the New York Giants, where Kingsbury is expected to interview for the team’s vacant head-coaching position.\n\nKingsbury was offensive coordinator with Washington the past two seasons. His parting with the Commanders was described as a mutual decision between Kingsbury and Washington head coach Dan Quinn.\n\nKingsbury was praised for his work with the Commanders during Jayden Daniels’ 2024 rookie season as Washington went to the playoffs and had one of the league’s better offenses. With Daniels suffering through an injury-plagued 2025, the Commanders won just five games and Kingsbury’s offense was not nearly as prolific.\n\nDaniels and other Commanders players are apparently not happy with Kingsbury’s exit.\n\nKingsbury was head coach of the Arizona Cardinals for four seasons, from 2019-2022. He compiled a 28-37-1 (.432 winning percentage). His best season was 2021, when the Cardinals went 11-6 and lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams.\n\nPrior to Arizona, Kingsbury went 35-40 (.467) in six seasons as head coach at Texas Tech.\n\nI discussed Kingsbury with David Harrison, Commanders insider for Locked on Commanders, recently. Harrison said he would “lean to the side of no,” when I asked him if he thought Kingsbury should be in the conversation for the Giants.\n\n“I think that to be fair, like I don’t get to see, and you know this obviously, but to those who don’t, I don’t get to see Cliff do his day-to-day job and and all those things and full interaction with the players. So there there’s got to be a big grain of salt taken with I think any media member’s opinion on whether or not a guy would be a good head coach,” Harrison said. “But just looking at some of the things I can look at, Cliff still seems to be a guy who is very much kind of stuck in his way.\n\n“Kliff Kingsbury at the end of the day when he feels the he has the excuse, when he feels he has the reason, he’s going to revert back to what he wants to do. It’s not really about what is best for my team. It’s not and and don’t me wrong, like he thinks it’s best for his team, right? I should I should definitely put that in there. It’s not like he’s saying, “I don’t care that that’s what’s best. I want to do what I want to do.” Like, he thinks it’s best for his team. But what he doesn’t have is the situational awareness to understand that like, ‘No, it’s not’.\n\n“… until the head man says, “Hey dude, this is what we’re going to do.” He’s not going to see it himself. And if I’m hiring a head coach, I need a guy that can see the picture for what it is, not see the confirmation bias, that he wants to tell himself that he’s right all the time. And I just don’t think that Cliff is there.”",

    "fullText": "A new study has bolstered a scathing dissent from liberal Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that warned the court appeared to favor the rich.\n\nThe study, published Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research, investigated whether the Supreme Court has contributed to rising income inequality by ruling in favor of policies that favor wealthy parties.\n\nIts authors—two academics from Columbia University in New York and one from Yale University—found that in cases pitting the rich against the poor, Republican appointees were far more likely than their Democratic colleagues to side with the wealthier party.\n\nBack in 1953, Democratic and Republican appointees were statistically indistinguishable on the issue, with justices appointed by members of both parties favoring the rich in 45 percent of cases on average.\n\nThe average Democratic justice cast a “pro-rich” vote—which was defined as a vote that would directly shift resources to the party that was more likely to be wealthy, including votes that supported businesses over consumers or workers—just 35 percent of the time.\n\n“The results reveal a steady increase in polarization, mostly due to Republican appointees whose decisions rise from about 50 percent pro-rich share to a 70 percent pro-rich share over the course of 70 years,” the study’s authors, Andrea Prat, a Columbia economics professor, Jacob Spitz, a Columbia PhD student, Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, and wrote.\n\nThe findings also supported a June dissent authored by Brown Jackson, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe justices held 7-2 that oil and gas companies had legal standing to challenge California’s environmental regulations requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered ones.\n\n“This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens,” Brown Jackson wrote. “I worry that the fuel industry’s gain comes at a reputational cost for this Court, which is already viewed by many as being overly sympathetic to corporate interests.”\n\nThat perception could be contributing to an overall drop in public confidence in the court, according to the Times. The Daily Beast has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.\n\nThe court’s favorability rating has plunged by 22 points over the past five years, from 70 percent in 2020 to a near-record low 48 percent late last year, the Pew Research Center reported in September.\n\nAnd although a vast majority of Americans, or 86 percent, think the justices should be non-partisan, 56 percent said the justices were doing only a fair or poor job of keeping their political views out of their legal decision-making.",

    "description": "The New York Rangers’ 3-2 loss to the Utah Mammoth was overshadowed by Igor Shetserkin’s injury scare.",
    "fullText": "The New York Rangers’ 3-2 loss to the Utah Mammoth was overshadowed by Igor Shetserkin’s injury scare.\n\nIn the first period, with JJ Peterka driving to the net, Shesterkin’s leg seemed to get caught in an awkward position.\n\nAfter lying on the ice in agony for over a minute, Shesterkin made his way to the locker room with the help of a trainer, unable to put any weight on his leg.\n\nMike Sullivan confirmed that Shesterkin is being evaluated for a lower-body injury, but he did not delve into much detail regarding his long-term status.\n\n“I mean, obviously we don't want him to get hurt,” Sullivan said. “He's an important part of this team, and hopefully it's not too serious. I don't have an answer for you because obviously they're gonna do more more testament right now he's being evaluated.”\n\nWhile it’s never safe to assume anything, Shesterkin’s injury certainly did look concerning, and if he is indeed slated to miss a long period of time, the Rangers are in a heap of trouble.\n\nShesterkin serves as the Rangers’ engine, and his loss for any period of time is extremely problematic for the Blueshirts.\n\n“There are certain guys that drive your team. He's one of them for us,” Sullivan said of Shesterkin. “He's an elite player at his position. I think he's one of the very best in the game. When you lose a player like that for any length of time, those types of players are difficult to replace.”\n\nJonathan Quick ultimately filled in for the injured Shesterkin and recorded 14 saves on 17 shots. He set the tone, making some crucial stops while also showing a level of passion, specifically when Daniil But bumped into him, and decided to go after him.\n\nIf Shesterkin is to miss time, the Rangers will be forced to rely on the 39-year-old Quick.\n\n“He's a fierce competitor. He's still an excellent goalie,” Sullivan said of Quick. “He's one of the leaders in that room, for good reason. His body of work speaks for itself. If you ask my opinion, I think he's a first ballot Hall of Famer with what he's accomplished in the game. He loves the game, and he loves to compete, and he's very capable.”\n\nThe game, in which the Rangers were unable to hold onto a one-goal lead in the third period, en route to an overtime loss, feels meaningless due to what could possibly be at stake with Shesterkin’s injury and the ripple effect it would have on the rest of the team.\n\nAs it stands right now, the Rangers are three points out of a wild-card spot with three games in hand as it will be a dog fight to make the playoffs.\n\nIgor Shesterkin Exits Game Against Mammoth After Suffering Scary-Looking Injury In the first period of the New York <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/new-york-rangers\">Rangers</a>’ Monday night game against the Utah Mammoth, Igor Shesterkin suffered a scary-looking lower-body injury.&nbsp;\n\nThe direction Blueshirts’ general manager Chris Drury will go at the trade deadline would drastically change if Shesterkin’s injury were to be serious.\n\nWhen talking on WFAN Radio, Rangers owner James Dolan gave a vote of confidence to Drury, preaching patience as the team tries to build a culture under Sullivan, essentially ensuring Drury is not on the hot seat despite the team’s disastrous 2024-25 campaign and inconsistencies through the first half of this season.\n\nStaying a float in the Eastern Conference is a difficult task without Shesterkin.\n\nIf Shesterkin is out for a long period of time, Drury may be forced to take a selling approach at the trade deadline, directly impacting Artemi Panarin, who is set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer and is still without a long-term contract extension past the 2025-26 season.\n\nThere’s a lot that hinders on Shesterkin, and the severity of his injury will in all likelihood be revealed within the next couple of days.",

    "fullText": "Knicks owner crushes dreams of fans hoping for Giannis Antetokounmpo trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNew York Knicks fans hoping that the team will trade for disgruntled Milwaukee Bucks star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo will be disappointed by recent comments from Knicks owner James Dolan.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on The Carton Show, Dolan said that the organization is very happy with the roster as currently constructed and doesn’t see any major moves on the horizon.\n\n“We love our team right now. They have chemistry. They all like each other,” Dolan said. “I’ve never seen a locker room more copacetic. There’s a lot of energy in there. Leon [Rose] can always overrule me, but I don’t see us making a big change. This group can win a championship. I believe that.”\n\nLast year, the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2000, and they're looking to improve upon that finish this season. Dolan seems to believe that health and continuity is what the Knicks need to take the next step, not a major shakeup.\n\n“Look how far we got with our group last year,” Dolan said. “Then take a look at who was playing and who wasn’t. We had injuries. Now we’re going into the second half of the season with more depth. If we stay healthy, we’ll go into the playoffs in much better condition.”\n\nThe trade deadline is about a month away, and New York has been frequently mentioned as a potential landing spot for Antetokounmpo. But, if Dolan is to be taken at his word, that won’t be happening any time soon.\n\nPerhaps if the Knicks have an early exit from the postseason, Dolan could change his stance regarding the roster over the offseason. But for now, Knicks fans shouldn’t hold their breath for an Antetokounmpo trade.\n\nNew York Knicks owner shares harsh criticism of Tom Thibodeau\n\nJames Dolan explains why Knicks won't hang NBA Cup banner",

    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro defiantly proclaimed his innocence in a Manhattan federal court Monday morning during his and his wife's first public appearance since US forces captured them in a dramatic military raid on Caracas over the weekend.\n\n\"I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country,\" Maduro told the judge through an interpreter when asked for his plea on narco-terrorism and weapons charges.\n\nHe was then interrupted by the judge, who interjected, \"A not guilty plea will be entered on behalf of Mr. Maduro.\"\n\nIt was one of several dramatic moments during the roughly 30-minute hearing, which Maduro used to protest his capture by US forces.\n\nWhen he entered the courtroom, flanked by US marshals, he wished everyone a \"Happy New Year\" in English and locked eyes with members of the press sitting in the back of the courtroom.\n\nLater, as the hearing wrapped up, a person sitting in the fourth row of the courtroom gallery stood to say Maduro would pay in the name of the Venezuelan people.\n\n\"I am a man of God, and I am a war prisoner,\" Maduro responded in Spanish as US marshals escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were arraigned on an indictment alleging a conspiracy to import cocaine and a related conspiracy to possess machine guns and other \"destructive devices\" in furtherance of drug trafficking. Maduro also faces a narco-terrorism conspiracy charge.\n\nThe two wore standard-issue jail garb of navy smocks over orange long-sleeve shirts with khaki pants. At their seats in the courtroom, they wore headphones to listen to their court-appointed translators.\n\nWhen he stood to address the judge, Maduro held on to the arms of his chair as he rose unsteadily. Flores, her blonde hair tied back in a bun, had several small bandages on her face. She sustained injuries during her \"abduction\" in Caracas, one of her attorneys said.\n\nDuring the packed noon hearing, US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein read the couple a summary of their charges and informed the Venezuelan president and first lady of their rights before the pair entered not guilty pleas. He addressed them as \"Mr. Maduro\" and \"Ms. Flores.\"\n\nWhen asked to confirm his identity at the start of the hearing, Maduro began by stating in firmly spoken Spanish that he is \"Presidente constitutional de la Republica Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I am here, kidnapped, since January 3, Saturday,\" Maduro said. I was captured in my home in Caracas, Venezuela.\"\n\n\"There will be a time and place to go into all this,\" the judge interrupted.\n\nAsked for her plea, Flores spoke in a quiet, hoarse voice.\n\n\"Not guilty. Completely innocent,\" she said through a court interpreter.\n\nBoth Maduro and Flores are facing health issues and will need medical attention while awaiting trial, their lawyers said.\n\n\"Miss Flores, during her abduction, sustained significant injuries, as you can see today here in court,\" defense lawyer Mark Donnelly told the judge. \"There's a belief that she may have a fracture or severe bruising on her ribs,\" the lawyer added.\n\nThe 25-page indictment filed against Maduro, his wife, son, and three others alleges that for over 25 years, Venezuelan leaders \"have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.\"\n\nMaduro was represented in court by Barry Pollack, an attorney best known for also representing WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange. Flores was represented by the Texas-based attorney Mark Donnelly and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.\n\nThe attorneys said they would not seek bail for Maduro or Flores on Monday, but reserved the right to seek it at a later date. Pollack told Hellerstein he anticipated \"voluminous and complicated legal practice.\"\n\n\"Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,\" Pollack said. \"He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.\"\n\nHellerstein scheduled the next court hearing for March 17.\n\nMaduro has long been a target of the US Justice Department. Manhattan federal prosecutors first indicted him in 2020, accusing him of heading the drug-trafficking network, the Cartel de los Soles.\n\nIn 2015, the nephews of Maduro's wife, Flores, were arrested in Haiti and charged with drug trafficking by the same office handling the Maduro case.\n\nThe indictment says Maduro is \"at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.\"\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump said the US captured the Venezuelan president following large-scale strikes on the South American nation.\n\nTrump said the US will \"run\" Venezuela until a \"safe, proper, and judicious transition\" can be facilitated. It remains unclear how the Trump administration would carry out this plan and for how long.",

    "description": "The irony of Sunday's results are not lost on New York Giants fans, who were taunted by another 60-yard field goal.",
    "fullText": "What could have been for the New York Giants in Week 18...\n\nAfter losing control of the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL draft following a Week 17 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, the Giants still had an opportunity to secure the top spot this past Sunday -- with some help.\n\nA loss to the Dallas Cowboys and an unlikely Raiders win (with a few other dominoes that ultimately fell into place), the Giants would have picked first overall in April. And as fate would have it, the stars aligned with a single exception: Big Blue themselves.\n\nThe Giants came out on fire and dismantled the Dallas Cowboys, 34-17, ending any hope of securing No. 1 overall before the Raiders even played. And perhaps that's why the outcomes of the afternoon slate of games sting a bit.\n\nUltimately, the Raiders did their part. They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, 14-12, and did so in a way that is ironic for the Giants.\n\nSince 2014, 21% of all 60-plus-yard field goals have come against the Giants. All 21% have come late in the fourth quarter or in overtime. So it's only fitting that Las Vegas picked up their victory with a 60-yard field goal -- a career-long for kicker Daniel Carlson.\n\nWowza. #Raiders K Daniel Carlson just drilled a 60-yard FG for the win.\n\nRaiders will still have the No. 1 overall pick. The Chiefs draft position will also improve.pic.twitter.com/cQKPA1Wf0V\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) January 5, 2026\n\nUnderstandably, Giants fans reacted with frustration as the kick sailed through the uprights.\n\nIn the end, the kick and the Raiders' victory meant nothing for the Giants because the \"damage\" had already been done. Still, for Giants Nation, being on the positive end of a 60-yard field goal would have been a nice change of pace.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Another 60-plus-yard field goal taunts New York Giants fans",

    "description": "The Giants wrap up their 2025 season Sunday.",
    "fullText": "The Giants finish yet another miserable season Sunday, when they host the Cowboys.\n\nSo which Giants players — including injured guys who won’t play Sunday — will not return to the team in 2026?\n\nLet’s take a look at the players who definitely will be gone and those who are on the fence, as general manager Joe Schoen (who has overseen so much losing) is somehow trending toward returning.\n\nCUT CANDIDATES WHO LIKELY WON’T RETURN\n\nRB Devin Singletary, K Graham Gano, OT James Hudson, WR Jalin Hyatt\n\nAnalysis: The Giants have their young running back duo for 2026 (Cam Skattebo and Tyrone Tracy). They’d free up $5.25 million in salary cap space by cutting Singletary. Gano is a no-brainer cut ($4.5 million savings). Ditto for Hudson ($5.5 million savings).\n\nHyatt can’t even get on the field. A brutal third-round pick by Schoen. His cap number for 2026 isn’t crazy ($1.7 million), but the Giants would free up $1.5 million of that by releasing him. Why bother retaining him?\n\nMLB Bobby Okereke, LG Jon Runyan\n\nAnalysis: The main issue here is that the Giants would need to find quality replacement starters. The four guys in that first group are much more expendable. But releasing Okereke and Runyan is tempting if only because of the cap savings — $9 million and $9.25 million, respectively.\n\nPENDING FREE AGENTS WHO LIKELY WON’T RETURN\n\nQB Russell Wilson, OL Evan Neal, DT Rakeem Nunez-Roches, RG Greg Van Roten, OL Josh Ezeudu\n\nAnalysis: The Wilson signing failed spectacularly. (Expect him to retire.) Ditto for Schoen drafting Neal (seventh overall) and Ezeudu (third round) in 2022. Two more wasted picks. Nunez-Roches, who turns 33 in July, can no longer stop the run. Van Roten is solid but not spectacular ­— and about to turn 36. The Giants need a younger right guard.\n\nPENDING FREE AGENTS ON THE FENCE\n\nRT Jermaine Eluemunor, WR Wan’Dale Robinson, TE Chris Manhertz, LS Casey Kreiter, CB Cor’Dale Flott, WR Gunner Olszewski, TE Daniel Bellinger, S Dane Belton, ILB Micah McFadden, DT D.J. Davidson\n\nAnalysis: Robinson and Flott are the Giants’ top in-house free agents, and Schoen should work hard to re-sign both. Robinson gives the Giants a slippery presence in the slot, while Flott blossomed into a very good outside corner in 2025. Both would be significant losses if they depart.\n\nEluemunor is a bit trickier, since he is 31. But he pass-blocked well while playing on a two-year contract from 2024-25. You could make a legit case for bringing him back with a short-term commitment.\n\nThe other guys here are lower-profile players.\n\nBellinger lost his starting job to Theo Johnson in 2024, so he probably doesn’t even want to come back. Manhertz is a solid veteran presence. He is worth keeping as a backup, especially since he won’t be expensive. Kreiter will provide special teams consistency with Gano out the door.\n\nOlszewski is an OK returner, but not great. Belton has turned into a strong special teams player, though he isn’t starter material on defense. The Giants could easily move on from Davidson, who is inconsistent. McFadden was trending upward, but he got hurt in Week 1 and missed the season.\n\nCowboys vs. Giants free live stream: How to watch NFL game online (1/4/26)\n\nWhere to watch Cowboys vs. Giants free live stream today (1/4/26) without Streameast\n\nHow to watch NFL RedZone online without cable for Week 18 (1/4/26) | Free trials, live stream, cost\n\nGiants-Cowboys weather: Ice, wind and injuries loom over showdown at MetLife Stadium",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees have not made any major moves this offseason, whether it's a trade or a free agent deal.\n\nBut the offseason can move quickly, and a new rumor is drawing up some hype for the Yankees in their next potential move this winter.\n\nAccording to Ken Rosenthal and Chris Kirschner of The Athletic, the Yankees are reportedly in trade talks with the Miami Marlins over a 6'5'' right-hander who would be an incredible pickup for New York.\n\n\"With uncertainty around their starting rotation to begin the season,\" The Athletic duo report, \"the New York Yankees are talking to the Miami Marlins about a potential trade for starting pitcher Edward Cabrera, league sources told The Athletic.\"\n\nEdward Cabrera is an interesting right-handed starter who is 27 years old and under control through the 2028 MLB season.\n\nThis report from Rosenthal and Kirschner is a big one, as the Yankees, for the first time in a while, are seemingly making progress towards a big offseason move.\n\nAfter not showing interest in retaining Devin Williams and Luke Weaver, and plenty of other op names sign with new teams this offseason, there was concern about what the Yankees would do this winter.\n\nMore: Yankees officially announce signing of veteran infielder\n\nFortunately, this update from The Athletic is a bit of good news, as Cabrera, a right-handed starter, would be an incredible pickup if the Yankees can make a deal work.\n\nHe's coming off a strong 2025 campaign, where he had a 3.53 ERA in 26 starts with 2.8 bWAR, and 150 strikeouts in 137.2 innings pitched.\n\nWhile he's not pitched a full 32-game season, and has dealt with some injuries and inconsistencies in his big-league career, the promise he's shown is more than worth investing in.\n\nCabrera is one of the top starters who could be dealt this offseason, and if the Yankees, now in talks with the Marlins, can make this deal work, it would be a huge coup for New York after a lackluster offseason to this point.\n\nYankees' Cody Bellinger free agent rumor is bad news for potential re-signing\n\nYankees' young slugger named potential 'breakout candidate' for 2026\n\nYankees could pursue Nationals' 'ace potential' All-Star\n\nAngels sign ex-Yankees, Braves, Padres reliever to one-year deal\n\nEx-Yankees fan favorite and top prospect linked to American League contender after hitting .318 last season",

Whether you're pessimistic or optimistic, it's definitely not the good kind of history either.\n\nThe Jets will play the Bills at 4:25 P.M. today, and if they do not get an interception against Josh Allen, they will have gone through the entire season without getting a pick against an opposing quarterback. Making them the first team in NFL history to do so.\n\nThe projected starters this week do not necessarily have a history of turning the ball over, as the starters against the Bills have accounted for only 11 turnovers across their careers. Interceptions have been a bit of a foreign concept for the New York Jets for several years, but to go an entire season without having an interception is definitely something worth noting.\n\nThis offseason, the Jets will not focus solely on defense. Still, the franchise is aware of the shortcomings in competing in the NFL: being physical, playing fast, and forcing turnovers will be a priority in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: New York Jets are on the brink of history, and not the good kind",

    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores are reportedly awaiting their first court appearance at a Brooklyn jail famous for its poor conditions.\n\nNumerous publications, including The Wall Street Journal, have reported that the pair were escorted to the Metropolitan Detention Center late Saturday after arriving by plane in New York.\n\nMDC, which has yet to confirm the transfer to Business Insider, has been home to numerous high-profile defendants facing trial in New York City, including music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of fallen bitcoin exchange FTX, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of aiding the sex trafficking operation of the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nLuigi Mangioni has been housed at MDC while awaiting trial for the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe jail has been widely criticized over the years for its poor conditions, having been described as \"inhumane\" and \"hell on earth.\"\n\nLast year, the Legal Aid Society issued a press release lamenting the jail's \"documented history of violence, medical neglect, and human and civil rights violations.\" It cited reports of no heat during the winter and \"maggot-infested food.\"\n\nIn 2024, a federal judge in Brooklyn made headlines when he carved out a special exemption during sentencing to help a defendant avoid the MDC. The judge ruled that if the 74-year-old, convicted of tax fraud, were assigned to the MDC, he could serve his time under house arrest, The New York Times reported.\n\nIn March, Brooklyn federal prosecutors announced charges against 25 defendants in 12 separate cases tied to violence and contraband smuggling at the jail, which is located in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn.\n\n\"Over the years, MDC has become synonymous with egregious neglect and abuse with the people incarcerated,\" the Legal Aid Society said in a June press release opposing ICE detentions at the jail.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shocked the world on Saturday when he announced that the US had captured the Venezuelan president and his wife after a \"large-scale strike\" on Venezuela.\n\nTrump has said the US is \"going to run the country\" until it can facilitate a safe transition of power, and that US oil companies will now be free to \"spend billions\" on development in the South American nation.\n\nMaduro has been in the US Department of Justice's crosshairs for years, and in 2020, Manhattan federal prosecutors indicted him as a leader of the Cartel de Las Soles, its name for the alleged drug-trafficking organization run by Venezuela's military and political elite.\n\nAn expanded indictment unsealed on Saturday added as defendants Maduro's wife and son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra, identified in the indictment as \"The Prince.\" It accused them of participating in a wide-ranging effort to traffic drugs to the US to enrich themselves.",

    "fullText": "Less than 24 hours after throngs of ecstatic supporters poured into Manhattan for his history-making inauguration, Zohran Mamdani began his first full day of work with a routine familiar to many New Yorkers: trudging to the subway from a cramped apartment.\n\nBundled against the frigid temperature and seemingly fighting off a cold, he set out Friday morning from the one-bedroom apartment in Queens that he shares with his wife. But unlike most commuters, Mamdani’s trip was documented by a photo and video crew, and periodically interrupted by neighbors wishing him luck.\n\nThe 34-year-old democratic socialist, whose victory was hailed as a watershed moment for the progressive movement, has now begun the task of running the nation’s largest city: signing orders, announcing appointments, facing questions from the press — and answering for some of the actions he took in his first hours.\n\nBut first, the symbolism-laden day one commute.\n\nFlanked by security guards and a small clutch of aides on a Manhattan-bound train, he agreed to several selfies with wide-eyed riders, then moved to a corner seat of the train to review his briefing materials.\n\nWhen a pair of French tourists, confused by the hubbub, approached Mamdani, he introduced himself as “the new mayor of New York.” They seemed doubtful. He held up the morning’s copy of the New York Daily News, featuring his smiling face, as proof.\n\nMamdani, a Democrat, is hardly alone among city mayors in using the transit system to communicate relatability. His predecessor, Eric Adams, also rode the subway on his first day, and both Bill de Blasio and Michael Bloomberg made a habit out of it, particularly when seeking to make a political point.\n\nWithin minutes of Mamdani entering City Hall, the images of him riding public transit had lit up social media.\n\nIf the ride served as a well-timed photo-op, it also seemed to reflect Mamdani’s pledge, made in his inaugural speech, to ensure his “government looks and lives like the people it represents.”\n\nHis other early actions have also seemed to underscore that priority.\n\nAfter centering much of his campaign on making rent cheaper for New Yorkers, Mamdani raced from his inauguration ceremony Thursday to a Brooklyn apartment building lobby, drawing boisterous cheers from the tenants union as he pledged that the city would ramp up an ongoing legal fight against the allegedly negligent landlord.\n\nMamdani’s next action, meanwhile, showed the unusual scrutiny faced by his nascent administration, particularly around his criticism of Israel and outspoken support for the Palestinian cause.\n\nIn an effort to give his government a “clean slate,” he revoked a slate of executive orders issued by Adams late in his term, including two related to Israel: one that officially adopted a contentious definition of antisemitism that includes certain criticism of Israel, and another barring city agencies and employees from boycotting or divesting from the country.\n\nThe move drew swift backlash from some Jewish groups, including allegations from the Israeli government posted to social media that Mamdani had poured “antisemitic gasoline on an open fire.”\n\nWhen a journalist on Friday asked about the revoked orders, Mamdani read from prepared remarks, promising his administration would be “relentless in its effort to combat hate and division.” He noted that he had left in place the Mayor’s Office to Combat Antisemitism.\n\nMamdani also announced the creation of a “mass engagement” office, which he said would continue the work his campaign’s field operation did to bring more New Yorkers into the political fold.\n\nRinged by supporters and passersby who stood several rows deep, phones in the air, to catch a glimpse of the new mayor, Mamdani then acknowledged the weight of the current moment.\n\n“We have an opportunity where New Yorkers are allowing themselves to believe in the possibility of city government once again,” he said. “That is not a belief that will sustain itself in the absence of action.”\n\nAlso on Mamdani’s to-do list: Moving to the mayor’s official residence, a stately mansion in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, before the lease on his Queens apartment ends later this month.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets will play their Week 18 finale versus the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\nIt'll represent the last showing for a defense that must undergo a serious identity makeover in the offseason. Head coach Aaron Glenn will hire a new defensive coordinator. General manager Darren Mougey will also be tasked with acquiring more talented playmakers on defense. They are heavily outmatched heading into Sunday.\n\nUntil then, we've identified three potential X-factors for the Jets defense in Week 18.\n\nJermaine Johnson II hasn't recorded a sack in his latest six appearances. It's been tough sledding for the pass rusher who returned from a 2024 season-ending torn Achilles injury. Johnson continues playing with effort, so it would be nice to see him finish the season with a breakthrough.\n\nInterim defensive coordinator Chris Harris recently heaped praise on linebacker Jamien Sherwood. Sherwood leads the Jets in tackles by a longshot with 147 takedowns this season. Despite it being a lost season, he continues to compete to his full capabilities.\n\nVeteran defensive tackle Harrison Phillips has been a limited participant at practice this week. That indicates he's trending towards being available for Sunday's finale. The Jets need Phillips' run-stopping efforts against Josh Allen and James Cook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: New York Jets vs. Buffalo Bills: 3 X-factors on defense for Week 18",

    "description": "With a playoff berth already guaranteed, the Buffalo Bills are playing for health and seeding this weekend.",
    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills are headed to the playoffs, extending their franchise-record streak to seven consecutive seasons. The New York Jets, on the other hand, are going to miss the playoffs for the 15th straight season. I won’t kick them while they’re down — we know better than any fan base what it feels like to miss the playoffs for an absurd amount of years — but it’s wild to think that the Jets have been as bad as they’ve been for as long as they have been.\n\nSunday’s game not only brings the regular season to a close, but it also brings Highmark Stadium’s tenure as home of the Buffalo Bills to an end, as well. Barring something strange where the Bills host the AFC Championship Game, Sunday’s contest will be the final game played in the stadium before the Bills open their brand new facility in September. Fittingly, it’s the Jets coming in on Sunday to close the stadium, as the Jets were also the first opponent for a regular-season game in the stadium way back in 1973.\n\nThat game was a real barn-burner, as the Bills beat the Jets by a final score of 9-7. John Leypoldt hit three field goals, O.J. Simpson rushed for 124 yards, and the Buffalo defense withstood an Al Woodall 36-yard touchdown pass to Jerome Barkum in the fourth quarter to hold on for a win. While we’d hope the game on Sunday will feature more excitement than the first meeting in this building between these two teams, it’s possible that the game takes on the form of a preseason game given its lack of meaning in the standings for both clubs.\n\nBuffalo cannot win the AFC East, so they’ll either be the five, six, or seven seed depending on Sunday’s slate of results. The Jets, meanwhile, win by losing, as they can clinch the No. 2 overall pick with a loss and a New York Giants win. They could also drop out of the top three choices with a win and losses from some other eliminated franchises.\n\nHow do we pick players to watch for a game where we’re not even sure who’s going to play? Well, we make it up as we go along. Our five Bills to watch this week are below, but feel free to share yours in the comments.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nYes, I heard head coach Sean McDermott when he said that this week would be “business as usual” with the starters. I also heard when he said that quarterback Josh Allen is “in a better place” with his foot injury this week than he was last week. I’ve also seen Allen log “DNPs” at practice on both Wednesday and Thursday, and then a limited session on Friday. Allen is going to start the game. He might even play a drive or two as the team tries to ensure that he scores 40 total touchdowns for a record sixth consecutive season.\n\nIt’s going to be Trubisky time at some point in the afternoon, though, so I’m watching mostly to see how quickly the clock strikes “Mitch” in this game. Individual statistics are fun, but healthy players in the playoffs are much more important. Playing Trubisky for the majority of this game is the right thing to do.\n\nSpeaking of guys who will likely play a bunch on Sunday, Buffalo’s kickoff returner extraordinaire is likely in line for plenty of carries on Sunday. Davis has just 37 rushing attempts this season, and he hasn’t had more than nine carries in a game. He’s hit that threshold three times, with the first of those times coming against these Jets in September. Davis ran nine times for 24 yards against the Jets in the first meeting.\n\nI expect that he’ll have right around that carry figure, if not more, with more yards gained and greater efficiency this time around. Would it be great for James Cook III to win the rushing title? Absolutely. Is it worth risking him turning an ankle heading into the playoffs? It absolutely is not. Davis should see the lion’s share of the snaps on Sunday.\n\nEff it. If Coleman is going to log a snap-count number greater than his jersey number at any point, this weekend is the time to do it. If I’m the Bills, I make Coleman active and force-feed him targets all day. What do they have to lose? At best, Coleman looks great, it gives him and the team confidence that he can help this postseason, and it spurs him onward to a great run in January and February.\n\nMaybe Coleman looks good enough where the team can point to this performance during the offseason as a reason for another club to trade for Coleman, just as they can point to another Class of 2024 wideout — Adonai Mitchell — across the field on Sunday as an example of the power of a change of scenery. At worst, Coleman plays and looks like a total non-factor in a game that ultimately means nothing, and the Bills have all the data they need to give up on their 2024 second-round choice.\n\nThe reward of playing Coleman in this game outweighs the risk, in my eyes. I’d let him roll and see what the kid can do.\n\nAnother deep cut! Center Conor McGovern has been dealing with injuries all season long, and he’s gutted through them admirably. At some point on Sunday, I’d love to see the Bills give McGovern a break and go to their second-year man. This serves two purposes: for starters, it gives McGovern some rest. Secondarily, it gives Van Pran-Granger some in-game experience heading into an offseason where McGovern, starting left guard David Edwards, and top interior reserve Alec Anderson are all free agents.\n\nDo the Bills think SVPG has what it takes to step into the starting lineup next season? Or will they need to commit big resources to keeping the band together up front? And, if so, which linemen do they retain? There are some big offseason questions to answer along the offensive line, but for now, resting McGovern would be a good move.\n\nMany of us have been clamoring for the rookie to see the field more this season. Well, kid, Sunday should be the day it happens. Jordan Poyer is already hurt and out for Sunday, so we’ll probably see more Darnell Savage this week. Cam Lewis started in Poyer’s place last week, but given his tremendous role on special teams and in dime packages, the team will likely limit his snaps, as well. Cole Bishop is entrenched as a starter, but it wouldn’t be the worst idea to let him play a little less this week.\n\nDo the Bills want to use Hancock as a safety? Or, will they slot him in — pun intended — for nickel corner Taron Johnson? Playing Hancock more this week would be a good move, as it would give the rookie some much-needed in-game experience while also resting some key veterans.",

    "description": "Ultrawealthy tech investors like David Sacks and Peter Thiel are weighing their options ahead of California's proposed billionaire wealth tax.",
    "fullText": "Is Miami destined to be the new Wall Street, and Austin the next Silicon Valley? \"All-in\" podcaster and White House AI czar David Sacks thinks so.\n\nSacks kicked off a New Year's social media debate by declaring that Miami will overtake New York as the nation's financial capital — and that Austin is poised to replace San Francisco as the center of tech.\n\n\"As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital,\" Sacks wrote in a January 1 post on X that ricocheted through tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from defenders of the old hubs.\n\nLinda Yaccarino, the former CEO of X, responded to Sacks with the word \"Miami\" along with a fire emoji.\n\nGarry Tan, who runs Y Combinator, the influential startup accelerator behind Airbnb, Stripe, and Dropbox, weighed in, saying the firm hasn't expanded beyond San Francisco because founders are still much more likely to build successful, product-market-fit unicorns in the region.\n\nWe haven’t done it yet because it is much more likely that people create successful PMF unicorns staying in SF Bay Area at a rate of 2.5x more\n\nNYC is about 2x\n\nTan recently said he would consider opening an Austin outpost if California moves forward with a proposed billionaire tax. The ballot measure would impose a one-time 5% levy on California residents with assets exceeding $1 billion and could go before voters in November if it qualifies.\n\nSacks urged Tan to reconsider, arguing that a Y Combinator outpost in Austin could become a \"self-fulfilling prophecy.\" \"If YC and others support Austin, it will be successful,\" Sacks said.\n\nMusk replied simply, \"Yes.\" The Pittsburgh-based venture capitalist Brandon Brooks said an Austin outpost \"would be the biggest shift for the startup ecosystem in history.\"\n\nSacks is a venture capitalist, podcaster, and one of the earliest members of the so-called \"PayPal mafia,\" a group of PayPal employees who went on to positions of influence and power in Silicon Valley. His profile surged after he was appointed the Trump administration's artificial intelligence and crypto czar.\n\nSacks' own firm is already on the move. Craft Ventures said it opened an Austin office in December, with Sacks relocating to the city while the firm maintains offices in New York and San Francisco. Fellow Texans including Elon Musk, Michael Dell, and Joe Lonsdale, one of the cofounders of Palantir, welcomed him with posts.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe argument Sacks is making isn't new (one online poster on X even replied with a popular \"Grand Theft Auto\" video game meme showing the character saying \"here we go again.\")\n\nThe debate flared during the pandemic, when remote work drove waves of coastal workers to Texas and Florida in search of more space, lower taxes, and a cheaper cost of living. Austin, in particular, ascended as companies like Tesla and Oracle moved into the region, and giants like Google and Facebook expanded their office footprints.\n\nSacks has also been making the case that high taxes, heavy regulation, and a leftward political turn are driving talent and capital out of legacy power centers like San Francisco and New York.\n\nSacks posted his prediction the same day Zohran Mamdani was inaugurated as New York City's mayor, making history as the first socialist mayor to hold the office.\n\nLonsdale's venture firm, 8VC, moved from San Francisco to Austin in 2020. Lonsdale tweeted at the time that the firm was moving for several reasons, among them: \"Austin is far more tolerant of ideological diversity than SF.\"\n\nThe hype hasn't fully held. Some tech workers told Business Insider they later left or tried to leave Austin, citing brutal heat, traffic, overcrowding, and a tech scene that felt thinner than advertised.\n\nMeanwhile, Thiel Capital is expanding in Miami as California's proposed wealth tax looms.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thiel Capital, the private investment firm founded by the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel said it has opened a new office in Miami.\n\nIf the proposal passes, the tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Good morning Gang Green Nation! The New York Jets will be on the road to face the Buffalo Bills in the last game of the regular season on Sunday. Josh Allen has not been practicing this week and is not expected to play on Sunday. For tank commanders that may cause some concern. Certainly the Jets’ chances of an upset improve with Allen out. However, the Bills still have a substantial edge at quarterback with Mitchell Trubisky under center compared to the Jets with Brady Cook under center. Unless the Bills play all their third string players and practice squad call-ups, they should still be handily favored at home. Even if that were to transpire, we should not underestimate how low this Jets team has sunk. An upset is always possible, but for now betting on the Jets to complete their tank on Sunday seems the safer bet.\n\nHere are your links to your New York Jets this glorious Friday in January:\n\nSusanna Weir – Jets-Bills Game Preview | Aiming to End 2025 Season on a High Note in Buffalo\n\nJack Bell – Jets DL Jowon Briggs: ‘You Can Be Selfish or Selfless’\n\nJohn Pullano – Stock Report 📈 | Punter Austin McNamara Looking to Finish Atop League in Key Category\n\nBrian Costello – Tanner Engstrand believes Jets offense has ‘good foundation’ in place despite brutal season\n\nNick Wojton – 2026 NFL draft: Where are the Jets’ Round 1 picks before Week 18?\n\nNick Wojton – Jets at Bills: 5 storylines to watch for during lead up to Week 18\n\nJustin Melo – 5 pending free agents who won’t return to the Jets defense in 2026\n\nNick Wojton – Jets handed poor update relating to 2026 NFL draft ahead of Week 18\n\nNick Wojton – Brady Cook named Jets’ starting QB for season finale, here’s why\n\nDharya Sharma – Jets 2026 mock draft: New York predicted to use pick from Sauce Gardner trade on SEC quarterback\n\nJustin Fried – Jets’ tank plans may have just gotten more complicated in Week 18\n\nJustin Fried – Jets’ intentions with Breece Hall are becoming clear as free agency nears\n\nJustin Fried – Every Jets player entering their final game under contract in Week 18\n\nHere are your missed connections from yesterday.",

    "fullText": "Mets get matter-of-fact update on Cody Bellinger in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCody Bellinger seems likely to spend 2026 in the Big Apple.\n\nThe New York Yankees are in the running to bring Bellinger back after a prodigious 2025 season.\n\nThe New York Mets appear the biggest threat to steal Bellinger away from the Bronx.\n\nMLB.com's Mark Feinsand reported as much in a new article on Thursday night. He sees these as the two ballclubs leading the pursuit of Bellinger.\n\n\"The Mets have been among the teams most often connected to Bellinger, and after trading Brandon Nimmo and Jeff McNeil, the need for an outfielder (or two) is clear,\" Feinsand writes. \"The two New York teams seem like the obvious fits for Bellinger, though the Angels, Blue Jays and Dodgers remain in the mix.\"\n\nMORE: Team USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nFeinsand also provided an update on the potential timeline for a Bellinger contract.\n\n\"Bellinger settled on a shorter-term deal the last time he hit the free-agent market, but with no qualifying offer attached to him as he enters his age-30 season, he’s likely to wait as long as he can until he finds the long-term deal that has evaded him,\" Feinsand wrote.\n\nThat could be a way for the Mets to differentiate themselves. If they come to the table with a longer-term deal for Bellinger, that could accelerate the wait time to getting a signature.\n\nNothing is a given. Bellinger may decide he doesn't want to leave Yankee Stadium. But if he wants to try somewhere new, Queens may hold the answer.\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nReds have a promising prospect named Ichiro Cano\n\nIt's a good day to remember Bob Feller's brilliance and his time in the U.S. Navy\n\nHow Aroldis Chapman is able to pitch for Great Britain in the WBC\n\nAlex Bregman has a key free agent preference\n\nYankees' pitcher leaving MLB to sign in Japan",

    "description": "New York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, tackles the housing crisis on day one with executive orders targeting landlords and bankruptcy case intervention.",
    "fullText": "Sworn in at midnight and again hours later publicly, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani used his first day in office Thursday to hit the ground running with new executive orders targeting city landlords and housing development. And he said the city will take what he called \"precedent-setting action\" to intervene in a private landlord bankruptcy case he said was tied to 93 buildings.\n\n\"Today is the start of a new era for New York City,\" Mamdani said. \"It is inauguration day. It is also the day that the rent is due.\"\n\nSpeaking at a Brooklyn apartment building, Mamdani framed the moves as an early test of whether city government will directly confront landlords over housing conditions and step into court cases that could determine whether tenants remain in their homes.\n\nMamdani said New Yorkers who attended his inauguration were returning to apartments where, he said, \"bad landlords do not make repairs,\" rents rise and residents deal with issues like cockroaches and a lack of heat.\n\nZohran Mamdani Will Be First Mayor To Be Sworn In On Quran During New York City Inauguration\n\nThe mayor said the new administration \"will not wait to deliver action\" and \"will stand up on behalf of the tenants of this city.\"\n\nMamdani announced three housing-related executive orders, starting with the revival of the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants, which he said will focus on resolving complaints and holding landlords accountable for hazardous conditions.\n\n\"We will make sure that 311 violations are resolved,\" Mamdani said, adding that the administration will hold \"slumlords\" accountable for \"hazardous and dangerous threats\" to tenant well-being.\n\nMamdani Taps Controversial Lawyer Who Defended Al Qaeda Terrorist For Top Role: 'Powerful Advocate'\n\nMamdani said the second executive order creates a LIFT task force, or a land-inventory effort designed to leverage city-owned land and accelerate housing development. He said the task force will review city-owned properties and identify sites suitable for housing development no later than July 1.\n\nThe third executive order creates a SPEED task force, which Mamdani said stands for Streamlining Procedures to Expedite Equitable Development. He said the task force will work to remove permitting barriers that slow housing construction.\n\nBoth task forces will be overseen by Deputy Mayor for Housing and Planning Lila Joseph, he said.\n\n\"These are sweeping measures, but it is just the beginning of a comprehensive effort to champion the cause of tenants,\" Mamdani said.\n\nFlashback: Inside The Political Movement That Put A Socialist In Charge Of New York City\n\nEarlier in the day, Mamdani signed executive order No. 1, which revoked all prior mayoral executive orders under former Mayor Eric Adams issued on or after Sept. 26, 2024, unless they were specifically reissued by Mamdani's administration.\n\nMamdani signed a second executive order setting the structure of his administration, including five deputy mayors and their oversight responsibilities.\n\nThe mayor made the announcement at 85 Clarkson Ave., a rent-stabilized building he said is owned by Pinnacle Realty, which he described as a \"notorious landlord.\"\n\nMamdani said tenants in the building have dealt with issues, including roaches and a lack of heat.\n\nMamdani said the building is one of 93 properties connect to the same landlord, and the portfolio is in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nMAMDANI PICKS EDUCATOR WHO WORKED TO DISMANTLE GIFTED & TALENTED PROGRAM AS NYC SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR\n\nThe mayor said the buildings will be auctioned to a different landlord he claimed ranks No. 6 on New York City’s worst landlord list, adding the buildings collectively have more than 5,000 open hazardous violations and 14,000 complaints.\n\n\"This is an untenable situation,\" Mamdani said. \"So, today we are announcing that we will be taking action in the bankruptcy case and stepping in to represent the interests of the city and the interests of the tenants.\"\n\nMamdani said he directed his nominee for corporation counsel, Steve Banks, to take what he called \"precedent-setting action\" in the case.\n\n\"We are a creditor and interested party,\" Mamdani said, adding that the city is owed money and will fight for \"safe and habitable homes\" while working to \"mitigate the significant risk of displacement\" that tenants face.\n\nA tenant speaker at the event described unsafe conditions in Pinnacle buildings and said a section of hardwood floor in the speaker’s mother’s apartment had remained unrepaired for seven years.\n\n\"When they filed for bankruptcy this spring, Pinnacle gambled on making our housing less affordable and our lives more miserable,\" the speaker said.\n\nThe mayor said the moves mark the start of a more aggressive use of executive power on housing issues, beginning on his first day in office.\n\nMamdani's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nOriginal article",

The mercury stood at a chilly 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14.4 degrees Celsius) at the 8 a.m. start of the parade.\n\nAcross the country, in New York City, hats and gloves were as necessary as noisemakers at the city's New Year's Eve ball drop, where temperatures near freezing appeared to be the coldest in 10 years.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people gather along the nearly six-mile (10-kilometer) route in Pasadena, where the two-hour parade kicked off. Millions more watch on national television. Organizers at the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, the group that organizes the parade ahead of the Rose Bowl college football game, said they made only small changes to accommodate the weather, such as the tops being up on convertibles carrying grand marshal Earvin “Magic” Johnson and other VIPs.\n\nRain forecasts for the Rose Parade, which had been dry for 20 years, grew all week. On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for all California counties and a coastal flood advisory through Sunday afternoon along much of the Pacific Coast near San Francisco.\n\nMeanwhile, residents in the areas hit hardest by last year's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires were under evacuation warnings.\n\nIn New York City, the sun came out ahead of Mayor Zohran Mamdani's inaugural celebration, but other areas of the Northeast and Midwest were hit by an Alberta clipper storm and trailing Arctic front that brought snow squalls and high winds.\n\nConditions varied widely — from snow showers to heavier squalls — from Wisconsin through northern Illinois and Michigan and into northern New Jersey, southeastern New York and New England.\n\nAbout a quarter of flights were delayed out of both San Diego International Airport and Boston Logan, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.",

    "fullText": "New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart closed out 2025 with unshakeable belief in a rapid turnaround, pointing to the team's talent and near-misses as proof that contention is close.\n\n\"No,\" Dart said when asked if the Giants are far from turning it around. \"I mean, we've got the pieces. This is not an excuse, but obviously, we've had a tough schedule, and we've been in really tight games where this season could completely flip. So that's kind of just the league. It's those one-score games and who can capitalize on those moments.\n\n\"We've got a lot of talent. We have some good vets, and we have a ton of young guys who are going to continue to thrive. I’ve said this a lot, we just have a ton of excitement for the future because we know what this thing can do and how we can flip this around.\"\n\nCentral to that vision is reuniting with star wide receiver Malik Nabers, sidelined for more than half the season with a torn ACL.\n\n\"We'll for sure continue to be together and light it up,\" Dart said. \"I'm excited. Those are conversations that we have a lot, and we're two of some of the younger guys in the entire league at 22, so we've got a long future together, and there's going to be a lot of great moments. I know that he's been attacking this recovery process, and he's going to come back stronger and better, and he's going to be hungry for sure.\"\n\nDart admitted Nabers' absence stung deeply.\n\n\"He’s an incredible talent. He could beat anybody in the world. When you have a guy like that out there, he's a safety guy who's going to come down with the ball at all costs,\" Dart said.\n\nWith a young core headlined by the Dart-Nabers connection, the quarterback sees winning -- and plenty of it -- on the horizon.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Jaxson Dart bullish on Giants' future, excited for Malik Nabers' return",

    "description": "Yasser Salem has built a business council to advise Mamdani if he wins. The McKinsey alum explains that bosses are open to free childcare.",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: This piece originally ran on November 4, 2025, ahead of Zohran Mamdani's electoral win. We are resharing the story on January 1, when he will be sworn in as mayor of New York City.\n\nIf you read the tabloids, the eve of a potential Zohran Mamdani mayorality has turned Billionaire's Row into 1975 Saigon, with everyone looking to hitch the last flight to Palm Beach.\n\nTo put it more bluntly, the city's wealthiest and most powerful business leaders have some qualms with Mamdani's socialist platform.\n\nHowever, the story is not so simple, says Yasser Salem, a former McKinsey executive building a business council to advise Mamdani if he wins the mayoral election. Sure, the word socialism can cause some tension, Salem, the head of OneNYC, a pro-Mamdani PAC, said, but there are some surprising areas of overlap.\n\nSome, like Jamie Dimon, have softened their message in public as they've gotten to know the candidate. Similarly, in conversations with more than 70 CEOs, Salem told Business Insider that some platform planks, such as universal childcare, are acceptable to many in the city's business community.\n\n\"Some of them have said from the beginning that they understand policies like free childcare as a way to lower the burden of worry, concern, and issues that their employees have that prevent them from being productive at work,\" Salem said. Others took more time, but the affordability crisis is unavoidable.\n\nAccording to a recent study of public data released by his PAC, the average New York family spends over 25% of its income on care for just one child. The group proposes several public-private models for childcare, including some where the costs are shared by the government and the employer — an idea, Salem said, that has \"widespread support.\"\n\nBusiness leaders' main concerns aren't surprising: Mamdani's public safety plans will make the city less safe, and housing proposals will exacerbate the city's housing crisis.\n\nHowever, even in housing, there are areas of agreement, Salem said.\n\nBusiness leaders criticized Mamdani's plan to freeze the rent for rent-stabilized apartments, arguing it would worsen shortages, noting that Mayor de Blasio had tried rent freezes that failed to address the long-term crisis.\n\nStill, both sides agree the long-term fix is boosting supply, Salem said.\n\nThe difference between the business community and Mamdani is in their time horizon. Mamdani's rent-freeze message could help lower rents now and satisfy voters, while his plans for zoning reform and building 200,000 \"truly-affordable\" apartments can solve the deeper problem over time.\n\n\"Are we solving for rent prices going down in four years? Are we solving for rent prices going down today?\" said Salem. \"Because if you're solving for rent prices going down today, supply is not going to do it.\"\n\nAs far as public safety, Salem said the announcement that Mamdani would seek to keep Jessica Tisch on as NYPD commissioner has helped alleviate fears that the city would become more dangerous under Mayor Mamdani.\n\nBusiness leaders also wanted to know how Mamdani's new Department of Community Safety, which would deploy civilian mental health responders to subway stations and to answer some emergency calls, would work.\n\n\"For example, a McDonald's owner in a tough neighborhood gets somebody coming in causing trouble,\" Salem said. \"Do they call 911 and get a mental health worker rather than a police officer?\"\n\nThe answer, Salem told Business Insider, is that these changes will be \"additive\" and that mental health workers will join \"alongside, not replacing the officers on the scene.\"\n\nSurprisingly, he said, taxes don't come up as a big fear. CEOs told them they're willing to pay more if they \"feel that New York is a better place to live as a result.\"\n\nThe announcement that Tisch was staying on helped alleviate some of the more intangible fears of the city's business elite, too, said Salem, such as Mamdani's inexperience or his ideological commitments to socialism, or to the pro-Palestine cause.\n\nAnd Salem, who doesn't consider himself a socialist but instead a \"pro-responsible capitalist,\" also said that he would try to get CEOs to focus on their specific disagreements with Mamdani's policies, rather than focusing on \"labels\" like socialism.\n\nSalem tells CEOs that Mamdani is looking to expand the social safety net, not expropriate their wealth.\"He's not saying we're going to go from the corporate tax rate being 25% to being 75%,\" Salem said.",

    "description": "A New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.",
    "fullText": "United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addresses a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025 \n\nA New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart during which he seemed much more concerned with his appearance than policy.\n\nThe Times published a comprehensive story about the Trump administration’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday in which it suggested that Hegseth began his tenure at the Pentagon “as something of a blank slate on the war.”\n\n“He didn’t have any of his own thoughts on Russia and Ukraine,” an ex-Pentagon official told the Gray Lady. “But he had civilian advisers who did.”\n\nOn Day 4, the freshly minted defense secretary sat at a Pentagon conference table as one of his coterie of advisers argued for an immediate U-turn.\n\nThe ideological godfather of the group was Elbridge A. Colby, grandson of the Nixon-era C.I.A. director William E. Colby. The younger Mr. Colby and Mr. Vance had been introduced in 2015 by an editor at National Review who thought they were like-minded. Nearly nine years later, as Mr. Biden poured billions of dollars into arming Ukraine, Mr. Colby argued that “we would have been better served to put a lot more of that money to use in the Pacific.”\n\nNow, it was one of his disciples, Dan Caldwell, presenting the group’s recommendations to Mr. Hegseth, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other military leaders.\n\nThe Pentagon, Mr. Caldwell argued, should pause delivery of certain munitions that the Biden administration had promised to Ukraine, because, he believed, existing stocks were insufficient to execute America’s war plans around the world. Nor should it use the additional $3.8 billion left unspent by the Biden administration to buy weapons for Ukraine.\n\nGeneral Brown did not speak as Mr. Caldwell wrapped up. He simply shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\n\nDuring a trip to Europe the next month, Hegseth reportedly made sure to powder his nose for the cameras, but declined to answer Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov’s queries:\n\nThe Ukrainians had repeatedly requested a proper sit-down. Instead it would be a brief stand-up affair in an anteroom.\n\nBeforehand, according to an American official present, Mr. Hegseth dabbed his nose with powder from a small compact. “Look commanding,” he told one aide. The handshake with the Ukrainian might be shown on Fox; the president might be watching.\n\nThen the standing meeting began, Mr. Umerov coming in close, taking his voice down to a whisper, assuring the secretary that he knew America’s political and security agenda might be changing. He didn’t ask for new aid. He just needed to know one thing: Would the U.S. military continue to supply the munitions Ukraine was counting on, the ones approved by Mr. Biden? Every delivery sustained the lives of Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines; every delivery that didn’t arrive one day meant those soldiers would die the next.\n\nAgain and again, Mr. Umerov repeated his plea: “I just need you to be honest with me. Just be honest with me.”\n\nHegseth allegedly offered Umerov only nodding.\n\n“He wasn’t pleading for the answer that he wanted, but just for honesty, some indication,” observed one U.S. official. “He was saying: You can trust me; you can trust us. Just tell me what you guys are thinking.”\n\nThe post New York Times Deep Dive Alleges Pete Hegseth Donned Makeup for Ukraine Photo Op — Then Ignored Counterpart first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — CAPITALS 6, RANGERS 3\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Tom Wilson had two goals and an assist to lead Washington past New York.\n\nWilson, who earlier in the day was named a member of Canada’s Olympic roster, got into a fight with Sam Carrick in the second period for at least his second Gordie Howe hat trick — a goal, an assist and a fight — since March 3, 2025.\n\nJustin Sourdif also had two goals and Anthony Beauvillier and Aliaksei Protas each scored for the Capitals, who have won two of the last three games.\n\nAdam Fox, making his return from long-term injured reserve, had a goal and an assist for the Rangers, who have lost three straight. Vincent Trocheck and Braden Schneider also scored.\n\nWith the Capitals tied 1-1 and needing a spark in the second, Wilson rose to the occasion. The 28-year-old came streaking up ice and leveled Noah Laba before getting to the front of the net and roofing a feed from Connor McMichael to restore Washington’s lead as he became the first Capital to hit the 20-goal mark this season. Minutes later, he answered for Laba’s hit, fighting Carrick.\n\nThe fight, initiated by Carrick, put the Capitals on the power play. Sourdif snuck a loose puck past Jonathan Quick, who had 21 saves, to end a 16-game goal drought to make it 3-1.\n\nFox responded with a power-play goal of his own soon after to pull things to 3-2 going into the third.\n\nProtas and Wilson, netting his 200th career goal, added insurance tallies late to cushion the lead.\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) — Steven Stamkos scored his 600th career goal and Nashville beat the Vegas.\n\nThe Predators, in the middle of a season-long seven-game road trip, won for the 12th time in 17 games, including the third of their first four on the trip.\n\nThe win put the Predators (18-17-4) above .500 for the first time since Oct. 16, just five games into the season, when they were 2-1-2.\n\nVegas, meanwhile, lost for the sixth time in seven games. The Knights closed their four-game homestand with a 1-2-1 mark.\n\nNow in his 18th season, Stamkos scored his 18th of the season and ninth against the Golden Knights since they entered the league in 2017. The game-tying goal was part of an unanswered three-goal spurt over five minutes that turned a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 lead for the Predators.\n\nNick Perbix, Reid Schaefer and Michael Bunting also scored for the Predators. Justus Annunen made 29 saves.\n\nFormer Knight Erik Haula, who is two games shy of skating in his 800th game, registered the 200th assist of his career on Bunting’s goal.\n\nMark Stone, who earlier in the day was named to Canada’s Olympic roster, scored his 10th goal of the season, while Ben Hutton added his sixth for the Knights. Akira Schmid stopped 15 shots before being pulled late in the third period for an extra skater.\n\nVegas forward Mitch Marner and defenseman Shea Theodore were also named to Canada’s team. All three of the Knights represented their homeland in the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off.\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Darren Raddysh scored midway through overtime, and Tampa Bay blew three one-goal leads before beating Anaheim for its fifth consecutive victory.\n\nTampa Bay coach Jon Cooper celebrated his 1,000th regular-season game in charge with his 595th victory as the longest-tenured bench boss in the NHL. The Lightning’s coach since March 2013 has also led them in 155 playoff games, won two championships and reached four Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nNikita Kucherov had a goal and an assist as the Lightning skated off with a win in the opener of their three-game California road trip when Raddysh converted a pass from Brandon Hagel, who had three assists.\n\nJ.J. Moser and Brayden Point also scored for Tampa Bay, and Andrei Vasilevskiy made 24 saves.\n\nMason McTavish tied it on a power play with 6:58 left in regulation for the Ducks, who have lost four straight and eight of 10. Jansen Harkins and Beckett Sennecke also scored, and Lukas Dostal stopped 24 shots as the Ducks earned a point for only the second time in six games.\n\nMoser opened the scoring in the first period with his first goal since agreeing to an eight-year, $54 million contract extension last weekend.\n\nAnaheim scored its first two goals off turnovers, with the 19-year-old Sennecke getting the 12th of his rookie season early in the third period.\n\nKucherov scored his 18th goal on a cross-ice pass from Hagel during a power play four minutes later, but the Ducks evened it again when Pavel Mintyukov made an exceptional play at the blue line to set up McTavish for his 10th goal.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Macklin Celebrini had a goal and an assist hours after being selected to play for Team Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics, and San Jose beat Minnesota in a shootout.\n\nCelebrini and William Eklund scored for the Sharks in the tiebreaker, while Minnesota failed to convert on either of its two attempts. San Jose has won three straight following a three-game slide.\n\nIgor Chernyshov had a goal and two assists, and Jeff Skinner also scored for the Sharks. The 19-year-old Celebrini got his 40th assist of the season, passing Mikko Rantanen for second-most in the NHL. Yaroslav Askarov finished with 20 saves.",

    "fullText": "Heading into the 2025-26 NBA season, the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers were consensus favorites in the Eastern Conference. With two months of the season in the history books, the Cavaliers no longer appear to be a viable threat, and the Knicks are still coming to grips with Mike Brown's movement-heavy system.\n\nHowever, New York still has all the tools it needs to be a serious playoff contender. As such, if the Celtics do embark on a deep playoff run, they may find themselves facing off against the Knicks for the second straight season. Even though Boston is playing some inspired basketball, New York would undoubtedly have the talent advantage at almost every position.\n\nStill, the Celtics have been outperforming expectations and have proven that a never-say-die attitude can work wonders. That's why the \"First To The Floor\" podcast recently spent some time discussing how much of a threat the Knicks are to the Celtics' chances of postseason success this season, and whether New York should fear a potential trap series against Joe Mazzulla's team.\n\nYou can watch the full podcast episode by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: The Knicks may need to fear the Celtics",

    "description": "Miami, Seattle, and Dallas are shaping the new creator economy landscape as influencers spread out from LA and NY.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood remains the world's entertainment nexus, but many next-gen creators have decided they don't need a Los Angeles address to make it big.\n\nMiami, Las Vegas, and Seattle all attract more top Instagram influencers per capita than LA, according to new research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm.\n\nThe top two by total creator count were LA (over 12,000) and New York (nearly 11,000), followed by Miami (about 6,000).\n\nOther major creator communities have formed in established film markets, such as Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas, which have emerged due to their lower cost of living and production tax incentives. But other top creator cities — Seattle, Las Vegas, Philadelphia — lie outside those secondary film markets.\n\nThe ability to create content for social platforms from anywhere means creators can build a livelihood from just about anywhere. Talent managers say that, apart from when they want a creator to attend an in-person event, brands rarely request a city-specific creator when seeking a partner.\n\n\"You do have people in LA and New York making the lion's share of the dollars. But now they're increasing everywhere else,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. \"Eventually, there will be a hot influencer in Idaho.\"\n\nLooking at cities by concentration of creators, Miami comes in No. 1, outranking LA and NYC.\n\nSome creators are drawn to places that already have a robust creative community, like Nashville or Las Vegas. Others want to be near fashion and retail, which fuels a lot of the creator economy. LTK, a major e-commerce platform that connects influencers to shoppers, is based in Dallas, as was Neiman Marcus for a long time. Dude Perfect, a superstar creator group known for sports-focused stunt videos, is based in nearby Frisco. Miami, where Alix Earle gained social media fame and often appears, experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes.\n\nCreators also move to be near family and for a lower cost of living. It makes sense for people building a brand based on themselves to work in areas that reflect their identity. The biggest YouTuber by subscriber count, Jimmy Donaldson, a.k.a. MrBeast, chose his hometown of Greenville, NC, as his base.\n\nDude Perfect has recently embarked on a major expansion in Texas. CEO Andrew Yaffe said there's no need to be in LA with access to top brands and talent there.\n\n\"We'll be here as far in the future as we can see,\" he previously told Business Insider. \"There's no shortage of opportunity for us here.\"\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.",

    "description": "The New York Giants are looking ahead to the 2026 NFL draft and here are some prospects they should scout during the New Year's Eve bowl games.",
    "fullText": "On New Year's Eve -- Wednesday -- bowl season kicks into high gear with five games, including the Cotton Bowl Classic, a College Football Playoff matchup. All 32 teams will have eyes on these games, including the New York Giants, who will have a top-7 pick in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nThe Giants could still climb up to No. 1 overall and are likely to trade down for additional draft assets should they pick somewhere in the top-3. Despite rumors and speculation, it's doubtful they target a quarterback with Jaxson Dart, a 2025 first-round pick, under center.\n\nWith limited games remaining, Giants scouts have one final major opportunity to evaluate top prospects in live game settings.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of the players the Giants should key in on today.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Iowa offensive lineman Gennings Dunker\n\nAlthough the Giants' offensive line improved in 2025, they still have some issues along the interior. Greg Van Roten is an impending free agent, and the team has an out in Jon Runyan Jr.'s contract should they decide to move on.\n\nWith that in mind, Gennings Dunker could intrigue them as a potential late-second-round pick.\n\nHere's what Bleacher Report had to say about Dunker:\n\nGennings Dunker is a rugged, powerful in-line blocker built with the right stuff, but will need to kick inside to guard to mitigate his middling movement skills. He has the traits to carve out a role and crack a lineup on his rookie deal in a run-first, play-action-heavy offense.\n\nDunker is a 6'5\", 315-pound offensive line prospect, who entered the Iowa program as a 3-star recruit in the 2021 class.\n\nDunker started 11 games in 2024 at right tackle, earning second-team All-Big Ten honors. He started 11 games at RT during the '23 season and one in '22 at right guard.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Texas tight end Jack Endries\n\nMichigan is a mess right now due to various off-field reasons, but that doesn't mean it will be devoid of prospect talent on Wednesday. The opt-outs on both sides will hurt, but there's still something to watch for.\n\nWhile the Giants don't necessarily need a tight end, they could look for some depth in the mid-rounds, and Jack Endries is an intriguing option.\n\nHere's what NFL Draft Buzz had to say about Endries:\n\nWhat separates Endries from typical move tight ends is his football instincts and technical refinement rather than raw athleticism. He finds soft spots in coverage with veteran-like instincts and has eliminated the concentration drops that plagued his freshman season, but his modest frame and average speed ceiling prevent him from becoming a true mismatch weapon against NFL athletes.\n\nEndries represents the modern evolution of the position where receiving ability often outweighs traditional tight end responsibilities, but his blocking limitations create roster construction challenges that could affect his draft stock. His consistent production and technical soundness suggest he'll find a role somewhere in the middle rounds, yet the inability to contribute meaningfully in run support may cap his upside as anything more than a situational contributor.\n\nMichigan RB Justice Haynes (may not play)\n\nGame notes: Michigan linebackers Derrick Moore and Jaishawn Barham, offensive lineman Gio El-Hadi, have opted out of this game. Meanwhile, Texas had 12 players enter the transfer portal, and several more opted out of this game. There are too many to list, so keep track here.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese\n\nThis is the big game of the day and one that will be heavily attended by NFL scouts. What makes it more notable for the Giants is that several top-end talents will fall right into their range (from No. 1 to No. 7) -- most of whom play positions of need. Moreover, several have already been mocked to the Giants.\n\nGiants Wire has covered safety Caleb Downs quite a bit, so we went with linebacker Arvell Reese in the player spotlight instead.\n\nHere's what Mel Kiper Jr. had to say about Reese:\n\nThis is a complete football player. Reese jumps off the Ohio State tape, playing the game like a veteran. I see natural instincts at the linebacker position that allow him to make plays most guys just can't make, and he has the burst to get home when turned loose as a pass rusher. Reese has been a big riser in this class.\n\nArizona State TE Chamon Metayer\n\nGame notes: Arizona State wide receiver Jordyn Tyson, cornerback Keith Abne, offensive lineman Max Iheanachor, and running back Raleek Brown won't play. Duke corner back Chandler Rivers, offensive lineman Brian Parker, and edge rusher Vincent Anthony will also sit out.\n\nGame notes: Utah offensive linemen Spencer Fano and Caleb Lomu, and edge rushers John Henry Daley and Logan Fano will not play in this game. Nebraska running back Emmett Johnson Jr. will also sit this one out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Prospects Giants should watch during New Year's Eve bowl games",

    "fullText": "Christmas and the NBA have been synonymous since the league’s inception. The very first Christmas Day game was played in 1947 at Madison Square Garden between the New York Knicks and Providence Steam Rollers. The Utah Jazz themselves have been a part of this great Christmas tradition, playing eight games on the beloved holiday.\n\nJazz fans have fond memories of the six wins and probably have forgotten the two losses they’ve sustained throughout, but which is the best Jazz Christmas game? To commemorate this holiday tradition, The Lead has done its research to rank these Jazz Christmas games from worst to best.\n\nDisclaimer: there are only a select few games that have footage to go with them. Each game was ranked by the story behind it, how the game played out, and what players made the biggest impact.\n\nWhen it came to the most lackluster of the games, the Jazz vs the Phoenix Suns was the worst.\n\nThe game was played on Dec. 25, 1982, and the Jazz found themselves struggling to defend throughout the game. At one point in the third quarter, they were down by at least 20. They did manage a small comeback, but it wasn’t enough with the score being 111-101, Suns.\n\nThe only bright spots in that game were the combined effort of Jeff Wilkins, Ben Poquette, and Danny Schayes, scoring 58 of the Jazz’s 101 points. Number seven is the Jazz vs the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe seventh-place game on this list was played on Dec 25, 1977, against the Spurs (one of the last years the Jazz were in New Orleans). This game was between two 70s basketball heavyweights, Pistol Pete Maravich and George Gervin.\n\nThough the Jazz were never really close to winning, they weren’t blown out, and it was a little closer in score. Maravich led the Jazz with 27 points, four steals, and four rebounds. Gervin led the Spurs with 31 points, two blocks, five assists, and one steal. The game also gets bonus points for being the last Christmas game for the Jazz before the move to Utah.\n\nPistol Pete Maravich scored 3,667 points in 83 games over 3 years at LSU.\n\nIf you took the nation's top 83 single-game scoring performances in the last 3 years(not including this season)you'd have a combined 3,465 total points pic.twitter.com/By7PJ7WoPh\n\n— BaseballHistoryNut (@nut_history) December 4, 2025\n\nFor it being the first Christmas Day game, one would think this game would be ranked higher. However, the games to come stand out \n\nThe Jazz had a record of 11-18, though it didn’t stop them from punching above their weight. What the game lacked in story points, it earned in style points – the game was a slugfest between the two teams.\n\nThe Jazz controlled the first half of the game, then the Rockets stormed back to take the lead in the third quarter. Magic happened in the fourth, and the Jazz squeaked by to secure the two-point win over the Rockets. Any game ending with a winning shot is worth watching. Sadly, there was no found footage of the game.\n\nThe leading scorer for the Jazz was Louie Nelson with 21 points, seven rebounds, and two assists. Maravich scored 19 points and added four assists to the cause.\n\nThe fifth pick barely passed the sixth pick by being the Jazz’s first Christmas win in the twenty-first century. The year 2018 marked a new beginning for the Jazz as Gordon Hayward left for Boston and Donovan Mitchell became Utah’s new star.\n\nOn Dec 25, 2018, the league decided to give this exciting young Jazz core a chance on Santa’s big day. They were paired with a Portland Trail Blazers team, looking to prove their dominance.\n\nStyle points for this game were quite low. The first half was quite close, with Damian Lillard putting the Blazers on his back. He ended up with a stat line of 20 points, four assists, and five rebounds.\n\nOnce the Jazz got control of the game in the second half, they didn’t look back. However, player contributions were quite huge.\n\nDefensive beast Rudy Gobert had 18 points, 14 rebounds, and seven blocks. He was aided by Mitchell’s 19 points, two assists, and two rebounds. Even NBA legend Joe Ingles contributed 15 points to the Jazz’s win. Any game with Ingles deserves to be higher on the list.\n\nThis next game had both Jazz and LA Lakers greats going toe-to-toe with each other. Even though it was a blowout victory, the Jazz beating the Lakers alone makes this game legendary.\n\nThe game was a precursor to an amazing Western Conference Semifinals series between the two bruisers that same year. Magic Johnson had a good game of 18 points, 10 assists, three steals, and five rebounds.\n\nKarl Malone showed the league he was Him with 31 points, two steals, and 12 rebounds. Current Jazz color analyst Thurl Bailey added 22 points and seven rebounds off the bench.\n\nNot only did fans see great individual performances, but they also got to see a shoving match between Malone and Johnson. This further added to this game’s repertoire.\n\nPlayed on Christmas Day 1979, the third spot is a story full of triumph and heartbreak.\n\nThe Jazz won pretty handily against their Rocky Mountain neighbors, the Denver Nuggets. How they did it was quite phenomenal. It was a tight game through the second and third quarters. With the game on the line, the Jazz had two heroes emerge to lead them to victory.\n\nThe first player was Jazz all-timer Adrian Dantley, who came in to score 27 points and four assists. The second player to make his impact was a little-known shooting guard named Terry Furlow, who ended up scoring 37 points, five assists, and two rebounds. It was the best game of Furlow’s career.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn’t the biggest impact he made on the league. In the waking hours of May 23, 1980, after partying, Furlow crashed into a utility pole, killing him on impact. Drugs were found in his system.\n\nLakers legend Johnson was a pallbearer at his funeral – a stark reminder of how fragile life is and how important the holidays are to see family members and friends.\n\nAt Terry Furlow’s funeral, stars like @MagicJohnson, Campy Russell, Greg Kelser, and George McGinnis were some of the pallbearers at New Jerusalem Church in Flint. See this vintage @flintjournal photo. He was truly one of the greats.\n\n— Eric Woodyard (@E_Woodyard) January 2, 2018\n\nThe second-best game was set at the height of the Jazz renaissance in the early 2020s.\n\nThe Jazz were set to face the Dallas Mavericks on Dec 25, 2021. Having their best record in years, the three-seeded Jazz were looking to show the league who they were. The Mavericks, on the other hand, were full of a young core trying to prove themselves.\n\nThe game was like two heavyweights dealing blows. The Mavericks would control the game, then the Jazz would make a run. Mitchell had a heyday even while being hampered by an injury, scoring 33 points, three assists, and three steals.\n\nKristaps Porzingis and Jalen Brunson feasted on smaller defenders, scoring a combined 54 points. It took a combined effort from Mitchell, the Flamethrower Jordan Clarkson, and the rest of the starting core to win in the fourth quarter.\n\nOut of all of the games, this was one of the most entertaining, with both teams having trouble keeping a lead. It also had great performances from individual players.\n\nIt was tough to decide between the number one and number two picks. Both were great games and featured great performances. However, number one was a better game with Jazz greats playing to their fullest. Much like pick two, the number one game was a back-and-forth conundrum.\n\nBoth the Jazz and Rockets were getting a piece of each other in the early half of the season. On Christmas Day, 1997, fans got to see a preview of an iconic playoff series. It wasn’t until the third quarter that the Jazz managed to keep a small lead.\n\nJohn Stockton robbed the world of a Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets NBA Finals.\n\nJordan, Pippen, Rodman vs. Olajuwon, Drexler, Barkley would’ve been must see TV and the Rockets owned the Bulls back then.\n\nRockets in 6 https://t.co/AEzZxM47rH pic.twitter.com/5ifMVJeO8I\n\n— V̷a̷t̷o̷r̷ (@VatorSports) May 28, 2023\n\nThe Rockets weren’t done and ended up coming back to tie the Jazz 101-101 in the fourth quarter. John Stockton took over and scored four major points to put the team ahead. Kevin Willis answered back with a tip-shot to put the Rockets within striking distance. Bryon Russell struggled off the bench but drew a foul to shoot two free throws to ice the game.\n\nStockton scored 24 points and tallied three assists, while Malone added 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Jeff Hornacek made a huge contribution as well with 20 points and nine assists.\n\nNot only did Stockton, Malone, and Hornacek outduel the likes of Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, and Willis, but it was a glimpse of a great Western Conference finals matchup, showing why this game is worthy of the number one pick.\n\nThe post What is the Best Christmas Day Game in Jazz History? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "fullText": "I'll never forget my first train cabin. Before I'd spent 140 hours on overnight trains in the US and Europe, I had no idea what to expect of my 30-hour journey from New York City to Miami in October 2021.\n\nFor my first overnight Amtrak trip, I was set on having a bed in a private space. So I spent $500 on a roomette accommodation — the cheapest private cabin I could find.\n\nThe 22.75-square-foot cabin contained two beds, a toilet, and basic amenities. Thanks to clever storage hacks, it felt like a tiny hotel room with no unused space.\n\nSee inside the most affordable Amtrak ride in a private cabin.\n\nInside the enclosed space with a sliding door, I found two seats, a table, and a bed above the seats that pulled down. The seats also pulled out into a bed.\n\nI thought this was a big step up from sitting in coach, where you get one train seat and sit with other passengers.\n\nI was also surprised to be able to control the temperature inside my roomette with a dial and air conditioning vents. I kept it cool, about 66 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFor dinner, I had braised short ribs, mashed potatoes, and a hard roll. While I didn't love the meal as it came, I made a little sandwich out of the ingredients, which tasted better to me.\n\nI decided to try sleeping on the top bed. I thought the available blankets wrapped in plastic were surprisingly soft and comfortable.\n\nWhile I found the train movement through the night a little unsettling, I appreciated the dim, blue light on the wall next to me. It was my favorite feature of the roomette because it reminded me of my colorful night light at home.\n\nAfter 30 hours in a roomette, I would book the accommodation again. But for those looking for more room to stretch out, I recommend the Amtrak bedroom.",

    "description": "New York Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka: \"I don't have any doubts\" that Jaxson Dart is a franchise quarterback.",
    "fullText": "New York Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka offered glowing praise for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart on Monday, declaring unequivocally that the young signal-caller has already established himself as the team's franchise quarterback.\n\n\"I don't have any doubts about that,\" Kafka said when asked if he believes Dart is a legitimate NFL franchise quarterback.\n\nDart, who entered the season as the backup before taking over as a starter, has impressed Kafka with his natural leadership that extends beyond the offense.\n\n\"I've seen Jaxson just become more comfortable in that role,\" Kafka said. \"It's not about forcing anything, it's just about being himself and leading the way that he sees it and bringing guys along with him. Those are the qualities that we've seen since the first day he's gotten here.\"\n\nKafka noted that Dart's influence has reached the defense, with players there citing his leadership.\n\n\"I don't think there's an age requirement for leadership, whether you're young or old or a veteran or one year or one month or however many,\" Kafka said. \"I just think if you have the leadership qualities, if you have the ability to, number one, lead yourself and then lead others, and guys will follow you based on how you operate and how you carry yourself, then I don't think there's necessarily like a prerequisite for that.\n\n\"I mean, Jaxson does a great job because he's just being himself and he's controlling what he can control. He's doing all the things that make him great and he's just being himself. He's not trying to be somebody else. He's just his genuine self.\"\n\nOn Dart's development, Kafka highlighted the typical leap from Year 1 to Year 2.\n\n\"I think you learn so much faster from year one to year two. You have that full season, you're in the NFL style, you kind of know how things operate. You've built somewhat of a framework of a routine on how you want to prepare yourself,\" he said. \"Now you have time after this season to go through, kind of refine the things that you want, how you want to operate in the offseason, and now you have some time to kind of look back and really dissect yourself and really can make some more steps to improvement.\"\n\nKafka, who has coached Dart since his rookie arrival, called him \"a pleasure to coach.\"\n\n\"He's been awesome. Learning every single day, absorbing as much information as he can, and then also putting his own fingerprint on things,\" he said. \"You see a player that's continuing to learn from the good, the bad, and then continuing to take steps forward... take ownership and take accountability and hold other guys accountable.\"\n\n\"I'm proud to be working with him and happy for him, and I'm excited to continue to do that,\" Kafka concluded.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Mike Kafka doesn't 'have any doubt' Jaxson Dart is a franchise QB",

    "title": "Backyard tiny homes are finally legal in New York City. They could be a boon for homeowners who can afford construction.",
    "description": "The NYC government has begun accepting applications from homeowners who want to build an ADU, including a backyard tiny home, on their property.",
    "fullText": "It's open season for some New York City homeowners interested in building a tiny home in their backyard.\n\nUnder a sweeping zoning reform Mayor Eric Adams signed into law late last year, the city made it legal for certain one- and two-family homeowners to add an additional home, also known as an \"ancillary dwelling unit\" or ADU, to their property.\n\nOn September 30, 2025, the city finalized its rules for backyard and attic ADUs and began accepting applications from homeowners, although the government is still working on the rules for basement units. The city estimates that the reform — part of its City of Yes for Housing Opportunity package — will help create about 25,000 new homes in backyard cottages and converted garages, attics, and basements over the next 15 years. But the success of the reform will depend in large part on homeowners navigating high construction costs and regulations.\n\nWil Fisher has spent the last year preparing for this. The former city government employee founded a Queens-based firm, Unit Two Development, that helps homeowners determine whether their property is eligible for an ADU and connects them with contractors and others who can help them build one. Fisher said he and his team have identified well over 100,000 eligible individual properties, and they've talked with more than 100 of these homeowners, who largely live in Queens and Staten Island.\n\n\"The rules of the road are now written,\" Fisher said. \"It was a long process, but for the most part we're off to the races.\"\n\nMost of the people Fisher has talked with are interested in adding an ADU to house a family member, including an aging parent or a relative with disabilities who needs care, or an adult child.\n\nMaggie Ornstein is one of these homeowners. Ornstein, 47, lives with her mother in a house in western Queens that has been home to five generations of her family since the 1800s. She hopes to build an ADU for her mother, who's undergoing treatment for cancer and is having difficulty navigating the stairs in their two-and-a-half-story home.\n\nOrnstein, a public health geographer, has consulted with Fisher and determined that she could legally convert her garage into a home.\n\n\"My dream for an ADU on my property would be something that would be accessible, but might also have a second floor where a family member could potentially stay if they wanted to visit, or if I wanted to be with my mom in the ADU,\" she said.\n\nAfter months of planning and big picture discussions with potential clients, Fisher is starting to nail down the specifics of what his clients could build and what it might cost.\n\n\"Now is sort of the pivot from the conceptual to here's exactly what it will take, and here are the cost implications of that,\" he said.\n\nOne inevitable obstacle homeowners face is the steep price of building in the city. Fisher estimates that adding a backyard unit or converting a garage will start between $300,000 and $400,000, depending on the project's size. That's compared to the city's median home price of $800,000.\n\nThe construction cost is out of reach for many homeowners who'd benefit most from adding an ADU to their property, said Thomas Yu, executive director of Asian Americans for Equality, an advocacy organization and affordable housing provider. Yu said there needs to be a much clearer and more affordable path to adding an ADU before the regulatory reform will unleash construction in lower and middle-income neighborhoods. He suggested tax abatements or grants for homeowners with more modest means.\n\nMany of the New Yorkers Yu and his team work with live in overcrowded homes with multiple generations of their family. They could benefit from having a home for an older relative or an adult child who couldn't otherwise afford to stay in the city.\n\n\"The ability for that generation to achieve independent homeownership is zero, particularly in New York City,\" Yu said of younger New Yorkers. \"So ADUs are the next half-step that's needed for that.\"\n\nOrnstein said she's been discouraged by the price tag on her potential project. She's also turned off by how extensive and involved the construction would likely be, especially given her work schedule and caregiving responsibilities. She's hoping to find some government funding to help pay for the project.\n\n\"It's so much more expensive than I would have anticipated,\" she said. \"On the one hand, you wouldn't be able to buy an apartment in New York City for what an ADU would cost to build. But on the other, it's really a lot of upfront cost.\"\n\nThe expense and hassle of adding an ADU might not make sense for homeowners who are just looking for rental income, Fisher said. But he expects the units will be easily rentable for those who want a tenant either immediately or in the future. Adding an ADU also tends to hike the property's resale value.\n\n\"As far as I'm seeing, construction costs are a little too high for them to be a slam dunk rental investment from day one,\" Fisher said. \"But for folks who have a relative or an immediate need that exists within their own family or social network, these are going to be good investments in the long term.\"\n\nADU construction is also limited by a slew of regulations. The units can't be bigger than 800 square feet or take up more than a third of a homeowner's backyard. The law also restricts basement ADUs in areas prone to flooding and prohibits them in attached homes, like townhouses.\n\nThe Regional Plan Association, a pro-housing nonprofit focused on the tri-state area, found that just 68,000 lots — 12% of the city's one- and two-family properties — are eligible to add an ADU.\n\nThe city says it's creating a \"one-stop shop\" full of information for homeowners interested in building an additional unit. The site will include a set of public, pre-approved backyard ADU designs submitted by architects, designers, and builders that homeowners can use to lower design costs and speed up the construction process.\n\n\"Efficiencies that can be built in are really going to be make or break for this market,\" Fisher said.",

    "fullText": "Mike Brown believes the New York Knicks have 'The Guy' to compete for a championship originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks are considered by the majority of the NBA as the favorite to win the Eastern Conference. Before the season even started, the expectations were high for the Knicks, considering the Indiana Pacers lost their superstar guard, Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nNow, the Knicks are not the number one seed, but they have the strongest chance of succeeding in the postseason. They also have a superstar who can carry them to victory in Jalen Brunson. With that kind of star power, it is hard to count out the Knicks in any game they play.\n\nDuring the Knicks' game against the New Orleans Pelicans, Jalen Brunson once again showcased his star power with 28 points and 10 assists. It was yet another superb performance by the Knicks, which is their third win in a row.\n\nWith that victory, they are only one game behind the Detroit Pistons, who are at the top of the Eastern Conference. The Pistons have lost two games in a row, which could mean the Knicks can keep fighting for the number one seed in the East.\n\nMore: Josh Hart's message fueled Knicks' historic Christmas comeback\n\nKnicks head coach Mike Brown always loves to hype up his players, including Brunson. He thinks that Brunson is good enough to be called one of the special players who can propel a team to a championship.\n\n\"You gotta have a guy. We're talking about a league MVP, and we have a guy. he definitely makes the game easier for everybody, for sure,\" Brown said after the game against the Pelicans.\n\nMoving forward, the Knicks will continue to fight in the upper echelon of the Eastern Conference. They are playing under heavy pressure because of their status as preseason favorites. The Cleveland Cavaliers have crumbled under that pressure this season, as the Knicks will hope to live up to the hype.\n\nWith how they have succeeded this season, including the NBA Cup victory, the Knicks can keep living up to expectations. It will be challenging, but Brown, Brunson, and the rest of the Knicks will do their best.\n\nMikal Bridges injury update: Latest news on Knicks guard's status vs. Pelicans\n\nKnicks star Is on pace to Join NBA’s elite crucial offensive stat\n\nNBA legend blasts Knicks decision not to hang NBA Cup banner: 'Celebrate the win'\n\nKnicks former NBA Draft pick gets granted four years of college eligibility\n\nSix New York Knicks featured in The Ringer's new Top 100",

Moore has only started one full season in college, which means he could decide to return to school next season to get more game action before heading to the NFL.\n\nPatriots’ Rival Listed As Best Trade Landing Spot For Maxx Crosby Next Season",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks will be shorthanded against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night.\n\nIn addition to being without Landry Shamet and Mitchell Robinson, the Knicks will have to compete without Josh Hart.\n\nHart is listed as out on the Knicks’ injury report due to a right ankle sprain. The Athletic’s James L. Edwards III broke down Hart’s lower-body setback on Saturday.\n\n“New York Knicks do-it-all guard Josh Hart will miss at least the next three games with a right sprained ankle,” Edwards reported.\n\n“Hart suffered the injury in the fourth quarter of New York’s Christmas Day victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.”\n\n“Hart, per league sources, is still undergoing further tests and will be reevaluated when the Knicks return from a three-game road trip that begins against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday and ends with the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.”\n\nThere’s no question it’ll be difficult for the Knicks to be the best version of themselves without Hart in the lineup.\n\nThe Villanova product is among the best rebounding guards in the league, always plays under control, is an underrated downhill attacker, and is a much-improved perimeter shooting threat.\n\nHart is averaging 12.3 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game with New York this season, shooting 49.8% from the field and 38.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nHopefully, Hart isn’t sidelined for an extended period.\n\nMore NBA: Golf could play surprising factor in Lakers' LeBron James' retirement decision",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf the New York Yankees are serious about landing another ace-caliber arm, Hunter Greene is the type of guy who fits exactly what they’d be looking for. He’s 26 years old, has elite stuff, and is under team control until 2029.\n\nHowever, that’s why prying him from the Cincinnati Reds wouldn’t be cheap.\n\nCincinnati has no reason to move Greene unless the return is incredible. He isn’t a rental, and he isn’t anything short of a star. He’s a prime-aged arm the Reds can build around, so any trade conversation would start with the Yankees giving up multiple top prospects.\n\nSB Nation proposed a trade that shows just how high the price would be.\n\nIn the pitch, the Yankees would send George Lombard Jr. and Elmer Rodriguez as the headliners, along with two additional prospects, likely from their upper-level pitching group. The Yankees' upper-level pitching is as good as any in baseball.\n\n“Given his age (26), ability, and contract terms, it’s difficult to find a good comp for the type of package it would take to pry him from Cincy. The Red Sox’s trades for Chris Sale and Garrett Crochet are fairly decent, the Astros’ acquisition of Gerrit Cole and Orioles’ move for Corbin Burnes less so.\n\n“At a minimum, it looks like the Reds could demand a pair of consensus top-100 prospects plus at least another pair less-heralded youngsters. It’s not a stretch to imagine the Reds demanding George Lombard Jr. and Elmer Rodríguez in addition to several of the impressive crop of upper level pitching prospects,” Peter Brody wrote.\n\nPerhaps the Yankees will want to add a bat with those prospects instead of a pitcher, but having another arm like Greene is never a bad idea.\n\nYankees should add former NJ HS standout, Tigers big leaguer with near .900 OPS vs. left-handed pitching\n\nYankees linked to free agent Blue Jays All-Star as huge Anthony Volpe upgrade\n\nHow Yankees' Cody Bellinger decision could lead to big trade rumors\n\nYankees 'Plan B' if Kyle Tucker, Cody Bellinger sign elsewhere revealed\n\nESPN trade rumor has Yankees acquiring two veteran stars from Twins\n\nYankees urged to swap Jasson Dominguez to Marlins for 6'5'' ace",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOnce the New York Yankees feel comfortable with how the lineup looks, the next move feels obvious. The rotation still needs help.\n\nNew York has enough arms to get through the regular season, but that’s not really the idea here. Injuries are already part of the conversation with Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodon, and there isn’t much if they were to be hurt.\n\nSure, the Yankees' staff is decent, but it needs to stay healthy.\n\nSigning depth helps, but it doesn’t change that reality.\n\nIf the Yankees decide to be aggressive, it’s likely going to be via trade rather than another short-term signing. They’ve shown a willingness to deal from prospect depth when the fit makes sense, and I’d expect that to be the case again this winter.\n\nThat’s where Freddy Peralta comes into play. The Milwaukee Brewers right-hander is under control, elite, and capable of handling a significant workload.\n\nHe’s the type of starter who would change things for New York.\n\nAlexander Wilson of Empire Sports predicted the Yankees will pivot in that direction once the lineup is settled and sign Peralta.\n\n“Once the lineup is secured, I expect Cashman to aggressively pivot to the rotation by targeting Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta. The Yankees and Brewers already have a well-oiled trade pipeline, established last winter when New York sent Nestor Cortes and Caleb Durbin to Milwaukee for Devin Williams.\n\n“While the recent move where the Yankees re-sign Paul Blackburn to a one-year, $2 million contract provides depth, it does not move the needle for a team trying to win a World Series. Peralta is the legitimate frontline hammer that helps protect a unit already dealing with major injury questions,” he wrote.\n\nIf the Yankees make a move, it’s hard to see it being for another depth arm. A pitcher like Peralta fits what they’d be trying to accomplish at this stage of the offseason.\n\nYankees’ Cody Bellinger predicted to ‘settle’ on $170 million deal amid quiet start to free agency\n\nYankees trade proposal involves George Lombard Jr. for front-line starter who throws 100-plus MPH\n\nYankees should add former NJ HS standout, Tigers big leaguer with near .900 OPS vs. left-handed pitching\n\nYankees linked to free agent Blue Jays All-Star as huge Anthony Volpe upgrade\n\nHow Yankees' Cody Bellinger decision could lead to big trade rumors\n\nYankees 'Plan B' if Kyle Tucker, Cody Bellinger sign elsewhere revealed",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Western New York’s latest winter storm has prompted Gov. Kathy Hochul to issue an advisory to caution commuters to stay off the roads and work from home if they can Monday.\n\nWith whiteout conditions expected at times along with wind gusts projected to reach upwards of 75 miles per hour — as well as the potential for flooding — Gov. Hochul is urging anyone who can to stay off the roads Monday evening, especially during the evening rush hour commute.\n\nWIVB News 4 was able to speak with Gov. Hochul on Sunday evening over the phone, where she also encouraged Western New Yorkers who can to work from home and avoid going out on the roadways.\n\n“Western New Yorkers, myself included, we think we’re tough, we can handle anything, but when you’re on the roads and there’s 50, 60, 70 mile-an-hour winds and the wind is blowing, it is a dangerous condition. And we want to encourage people if you can, stay off the roads, especially during tomorrow night’s commute from 4 to 7,” Gov. Hochul told News 4. “Just over the next couple of days if you can work remotely or stay home with the kids, forget returning that one item to the store that you don’t like for Christmas, you can do that later, just help us keep the roads clear. Stay home, stay safe.”\n\nAhead of the worst of the storm Monday, Gov. Hochul emphasized how her administration will continue to coordinate with local leaders to help keep Western New Yorkers safe from what’s expected to be, at times, a very severe winter weather event for parts of our area.\n\nA state of emergency that was declared by Gov. Hochul on Friday for more than half of New York’s counties remains in effect headed into Monday in anticipation of the worst of the storm.\n\nA flood watch has also been issued for parts of Western New York, as a slight risk of excessive rainfall is possible as a result of the storm. One to two inches of rain could cause flooding around rivers, creeks, streams and other low-lying areas.\n\nParts of Western New York could see between 1 and 2 feet of snow with this system, combined with high winds and cold temperatures. Snowfall rates of up to two inches an hour and strong winds will create significant blowing and drifting snow and near whiteout conditions in lake-effect areas.\n\nState and local leaders continue to coordinate ahead of the worst of the storm, taking steps to close certain highways where conditions could be very dangerous and life-threatening.\n\n“New Yorkers should monitor local forecasts and take caution to avoid travel in impacted areas,” Gov. Hochul said in a statement. “Plow crews, emergency management teams and utility personnel have been deployed and are ready to keep New Yorkers safe throughout the storm.”\n\nBeginning at 6 a.m. on Monday morning until further notice, an empty tractor trailer and tandem ban will be taking place on the following state highways in Western New York:\n\nI-90 (Thruway Authority Section from Exit 46 to the PA Line both east and westbound)\n\nI-990 (I-90 to State Route 263 Millersport Highway)\n\nRoute 400 (I-90 to State Route 16)\n\nRoute 219 (I-90 to State Route 39)\n\nThe City of Buffalo on Monday morning issued a travel advisory, effective immediately. The advisory was issued due to gusty winds combined with incoming snow creating “extreme whiteout conditions, reduced visibility, and hazardous travel conditions.”\n\n“City officials urge residents to avoid unnecessary travel, use caution if travel is required, and allow additional time to reach destinations,” the advisory said. “The City will continue to monitor weather conditions and provide updates as needed. Residents are encouraged to stay informed by signing up for BuffAlert, the City of Buffalo’s emergency notification system.”\n\nFor real-time travel information, motorists should call 511 or visit www.511NY.org, New York State’s official traffic and travel information source.\n\nRob Petree is an anchor and reporter who joined the News 4 team in 2025.

    "title": "Miami has the most top Instagram influencers per capita in the US, beating out LA and NYC",
    "description": "Miami creators, influencers, and social media personalities are finding success as the city becomes a creative hot spot.",
    "fullText": "Los Angeles has the entertainment pedigree, but there's another city in the US that's home to even more top influencers per capita: Miami.\n\nVale and Sebastian Genta understand why. The siblings and social media personalities moved back to their hometown of Miami in 2021, after spending five years in LA. The pair, who post about their glamorous lives and occasionally offer a wry take on influencing, wondered what their move would mean for their careers. They were pleasantly surprised.\n\n\"Miami was a completely different city,\" Vale said. \"The amount of events in Miami, the amount of people that are there, brands that are present, it's almost as much as LA.\"\n\n\"Many of us know each other, so if you go to events that Gucci is throwing at the Design District, you're more than likely going to bump into five to 20 familiar faces,\" Sebastian said of the upscale fashion and design neighborhood.\n\nThe Gentas aren't alone. New research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, reveals that Miami consistently ranks as the No. 3 metro area in the US by top Instagram creator count, after LA and New York City.\n\nMiami boasts over 6,000 top Instagram influencers. LA has roughly 12,000, and NYC nearly 11,000. (Seattle was next, with about 4,000.)\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm. Adler said that other platforms, such as YouTube and TikTok, showed similar trends.\n\nMiami still has a ways to go in absolute numbers to catch up with LA and NYC, long known as the centers of US media and entertainment, but it's punching way above its weight. It's only the sixth-largest market by population and the seventh-largest traditional entertainment market.\n\nLooking at the data another way, Miami actually has more top influencers per capita than LA.\n\nOther markets that regularly came up in the top 10 by this measurement are creative hot spots like Las Vegas, Atlanta, Houston, and Nashville.\n\nVictoria Bachan, an SVP at Wasserman Creators, said that for the new guard of independent creators, being in LA or NYC matters less.\n\n\"Take the biggest YouTuber in the world, MrBeast — he's in Greenville, NC,\" she said.\n\nMiami experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes. Creators found a growing number of events like Formula 1's Miami Grand Prix, which debuted in Miami in 2022, as well as the Miami Open tennis tournament and Art Basel Miami Beach, which offer places for them to be seen. Brands like Geico and Vuori also seek out personalities there when they want to tap into the Miami lifestyle and Latino culture.\n\nTop Miami influencers include breakout TikTok star Alix Earle, who gained social media fame while attending the University of Miami, and Xandra Pohl, a DJ and model. The scene features prominent food influencers like Samantha Schnur, known as The Naughty Fork, and Nico Norena.\n\nCities like Miami have also offered a haven for Angelenos struggling with the high cost of living in LA and early 2025 wildfires, Wasserman Creators' Bachan said.\n\n\"They're crunching the numbers, and a lot of them did pick up and move to Atlanta and Vegas and Miami,\" she said.\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.\n\n\"We saw a mass exodus,\" she said.\n\nLA is still the entertainment capital in terms of population. But this new data adds to the narrative of a traditional entertainment industry in decline.\n\nLA has lost ground in traditional film and TV, with the rise of lower-cost film hubs elsewhere. A growing number of A-listers have decamped for other cities.\n\nStill, there are limitations to living in secondary markets for certain types of creators. Being in LA or NYC is considered important in the industry if you aspire to be a Hollywood actor and want to collaborate in person with other creators and attend major events.\n\n\"Our advice is if you want to make money, have an address in New York and LA,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. Some managers also caution against moving outside the US, saying it can impact your ability to get brand deals.\n\nThe Genta siblings said they wish Miami had a bigger TV and film scene to help their peers who are seeking those opportunities. They started #NextGen Creators, an events series where creators can learn and mingle with brands.\n\n\"Many creators want to move on to traditional media, like hosting television, acting, whatever that may look like, and I do think Miami still lacks in that,\" Sebastian said.",

They died in a foreign country. And some are celebrated people, they’re very celebrated. But it’s so sad that a thing like that would happen.”\n\nHe then immediately moved on to the next question.\n\nSocial media users quickly noted that the president hadn’t thanked the fallen for their sacrifice, praised their commitment to freedom and democracy, or even offered his personal condolences.\n\nMany of the Americans who have died in Ukraine were U.S. military veterans.\n\nMike Meoli, 71, was a retired Navy Seal and firefighter who traveled to Ukraine to train medics on the front lines. He was killed in November 2024, ABC 10 News San Diego reported.\n\nNicholas Maimer, 45, was an Army Special Forces veteran and Idaho native who helped train Ukrainian officers. He was killed in May 2023 in an artillery barrage, according to Military.com.\n\nIan Frank Tortorici, 32, was a retired corporal with the U.S. Marines who fought on the front lines. He died in July 2023 after a Russian missile hit a restaurant where he was eating while on leave, Task and Purpose reported.\n\nThe U.S. government has declined to provide aid to American fighters to avoid any suggestion of a direct clash with Russia, which is a nuclear power, the Times reported in September.\n\nBut some social media users argued that Trump’s barely-there compassion for their families wasn’t measured diplomacy—it was reminiscent of the president’s previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during World War I were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.\n\nAlthough he failed to offer much comfort Sunday to the families of Americans who have died fighting Russia, Trump did manage to heap praise on the man who started the war.\n\n“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, prompting Zelensky to raise an eyebrow. “I was explaining to the president [Zelensky], President Putin was very generous in his feeling toward Ukraine succeeding.”\n\nHe also said he “understands” Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire while a longer-term agreement is being hashed out.\n\n“He feels that look, you know, they’re fighting and to stop, and if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn’t want to be in that position—I understand that position,” Trump said.\n\nPutin bombarded Ukraine with over 100 drones on Christmas Eve and early Christmas Day, killing at least seven civilians.\n\nSunday’s talks were intended to address security guarantees and possible territorial concessions, and while both sides said progress had been made, neither gave any indication that a deal was within reach.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Here's a look at the studs and duds (and those in between) from the New York Giants' 34-10 win over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders met in the desert on Sunday afternoon in a game where the loser had more to gain than the winner.\n\nThe two 2-13 teams entered the game on nine-game losing streaks, and the loser would be in prime position to pick first overall in next year's NFL draft.\n\nThe Giants haven't picked first overall in the NFL draft since 1965. For reference, that's two years before the Super Bowl era began. That streak will continue as they will now likely settle for the No. 2 pick, or lower, after besting a depleted Raiders team that put up very little resistance.\n\nIn that 1965 draft, the Giants chose Auburn fullback Tucker Frederickson first overall. San Francisco then took running back Ken Willard, who would go on to be a four-time Pro Bowler, with the second pick. The Chicago Bears had the next two picks and selected two future Hall of Famers -- Kansas running back Gale Sayers and Illinois linebacker Dick Butkus -- in rapid succession.\n\nFrederickson had a solid rookie season in '65 and was named to the Pro Bowl. Unfortunately, he blew out his knee the next season and was never the same. He retired after the 1971 season.\n\nSunday's win was only the second time this season the Giants led a game wire-to-wire.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the studs, duds, and in-betweens from the Giants' 34-10 Week 17 win over the Raiders.\n\nThe name is pronounced Wan'Dale, by the way, if anyone is interested. CBS play-by-play man Kevin Harlan repeatedly failed to get that right, but it didn't matter much to Giants fans. Robinson ate up the soft Las Vegas back seven, reeling in 11 of his 14 targets for 113 yards, putting him over 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career.\n\nAs stated, the loser would likely get the No. 1 pick in next year's NFL draft. But after watching this outfit, one has to wonder if that will even make a difference. They made sure that they were as toothless as possible coming into the game, shelving All-Pros Maxx Crosby and Brock Bowers, along with top defender Jeremy Chinn, this week. A \"soft tank,\" if there ever was one. Fernando Mendoza should pull an Eli if the Raiders pick him.\n\nThe Giants decided to let Dart be Dart, and so did the Raiders. He took advantage by rushing nine times for 48 yards and two touchdowns. He also completed 22 of 20 passes for 207 yards for a 91.9 QB rating. If he can beat Dallas next week, we'll crow a little bit more about him.\n\nIt was a day to pad the stats, and Burns did just that. He recorded 1.5 sacks on the day and now has 16.5 on the season with one game remaining. He had four total stops and three QB hits on the day.\n\nOkereke led the Giants in tackles with seven and had his first interception since the middle of the 2023 season.\n\nBelton continues to make plays. He also had seven stops and an interception. The Giants have to seriously consider re-signing him.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Studs and duds from New York Giants' Week 17 win over Raiders",

    "description": "Should the New York Jets consider bringing in another veteran bridge quarterback this offseason?",
    "fullText": "The New York Jets placed quarterback Justin Fields on season-ending IR earlier this week. It all but guarantees the end of Fields' disappointing tenure in East Rutherford. The Jets could release him this offseason and absorb a $22 million dead cap charge by doing so.\n\nDespite the somewhat sizable financial penalty, Fields' pending release feels like a foregone conclusion. Fellow veteran quarterback Tyrod Taylor is on an expiring contract. Taylor probably won't be back with the Jets in 2026 either.\n\nGeneral manager Darren Mougey will be tasked with acquiring at least one, maybe two, quarterbacks this offseason. Currently equipped with two first-round selections in the 2026 NFL draft (and three more in 2027), the Jets could target a quarterback in this year's class like Fernando Mendoza or Dante Moore. With the Jets currently slated to pick 4th and 18th overall, that may require a slight but aggressive move up the draft order.\n\nMougey should also consider bringing in another bridge quarterback. Right now, there's no guaranteeing the Jets end up with Mendoza or Moore. Even if they do, an experienced mentor could accelerate their development.\n\nIn recent memory, rookie quarterbacks who enjoyed immediate success were experienced college quarterbacks. Jayden Daniels, Bo Nix, Cam Ward, and Tyler Shough were multi-year starters. Other successful NFL quarterbacks like Justin Herbert, Drake Maye, and Jordan Love weren't Week 1 starters, and in Love's case, sat for multiple seasons.\n\nMendoza has 945 career collegiate passing attempts (and counting). Moore is a first-year starter. Not making comparisons, but recent draft picks who busted like Zach Wilson (sorry, Jets fans) and Trey Lance were inexperienced and asked to do too much right away.\n\nKyler Murray, Tua Tagovailoa, and Geno Smith (imagine that, ha) are among the veteran quarterbacks expected to be available this offseason. Murray and Tagovailoa may not be \"bridge\" options by definition based on the financial commitment needed. But someone like Jacoby Brissett or Malik Willis would be an upgrade on Fields/Taylor while buying the Jets time to develop a rookie quarterback, or draft one in 2027 instead of 2026.\n\nMougey has big decisions to make this offseason.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Should the Jets consider bringing in another bridge QB this offseason?",

    "description": "Maren Droubay moved from Salt Lake City to NYC with her husband and five children. She says her family is thriving despite the cost of living.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Maren Droubay, a 32-year-old who moved from Salt Lake City to New York City with her family. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy husband and I are from the Salt Lake City area of Utah, and we have five young kids.\n\nWe appreciated being close to family, nature, and a city with a variety of dining options and entertainment. But we always wanted our kids to have more exposure to different parts of the world and different lifestyles than what we felt they were getting in Utah.\n\nUtah is home, but we found ourselves traveling all the time. We were always on the road. We used to homeschool our kids so that we could travel.\n\nWe thought moving to New York was an impossible dream. We visited a lot and loved the feeling in the city.\n\nIt took us 10 years before the opportunity finally presented itself when my husband got a job in New York. We moved from Salt Lake City to New York City on October 10, 2025.\n\nMoving our family from Utah to New York was probably in the top 10 hardest things I've ever done.\n\nWe lived in an older house, so we had to do a lot of updating to get it ready for the market, sell it, and get it under contract.\n\nWe moved from a six-bedroom home to a three-bedroom apartment, so we really had to downsize — everything from furniture and lawn tools to our two cars had to go. I decreased all of our clothing to a quarter of what we had.\n\nYou have to uproot everything when you make a move like this, from finding new doctors to getting our kids enrolled in school. I am so relieved that it feels so worth it. Every day, I cannot believe we live in New York.\n\nTo find our apartment, I connected with people through Facebook groups or Reddit who were looking to sublease or have their lease taken over.\n\nI posted, \"We're moving. We need three bedrooms. This is the ideal block radius we want to live in. Does anyone know of anything?\" One person reached out to me and said, \"I am moving that very month to a different neighborhood. My apartment has three bedrooms. It has laundry and an elevator.\"\n\nIt was like kismet. It's the perfect apartment for us. We had Facetimed and looked at it, but we hadn't walked through it ourselves until we moved. We were just living on a prayer, and it worked out.\n\nWe have a large bedroom at the back of the apartment that my three boys are in, and they're on a triple bunk bed. Our two girls are in the second bedroom, with a mini crib for the baby and a twin bed for my little girl that can be turned into a queen when guests come. Our bedroom is at the front, and we have two bathrooms.\n\nWe have an incredible view of the skyline and the Statue of Liberty. We put my kids in the room with that view. When they ran into their new bedroom and looked out the window for the first time, it was one of those core memories that you never want to forget.\n\nTo prep the kids for the move, we had a family meeting and asked them if they were interested.\n\nThey've always been good travelers and here for a new experience, so they were immediately excited. We had a family meeting every week, where we answered questions or showed them pictures of New York.\n\nWe also made a family bucket list for things to do when we moved. We've been checking those items off on Saturdays.\n\nThe sadness hit when we said goodbye to our house in Utah. It's the only house the kids really knew, and Utah has the only friends they have ever known. Their grandparents and cousins live there.\n\nWe just let the kids feel the feelings. They know it's OK to feel happy and sad or excited and scared at the same time.\n\nI was nervous about how the city would react to my family. Would people respond well to a family with five kids? Would our apartment neighbors like us? Would the people on the subway be annoyed by us?\n\nI have been pleasantly surprised by how kind 99% of people have been. I will get to the subway, and before I even fold up my stroller, strangers pick up the other end and carry it for me. Everyone stands up and offers seats to my kids, or older women have even grabbed one of my kids' hands and helped them on or off the subway for me.\n\nThe community aspect of NYC is so different from our experience in the suburbs, where you live in a lot more isolation. You're in the car and then back at home. In New York, you're required to interact with so many people and make connections.\n\nStill, it's been hard being away from our support system. In Utah, we had friends and family we could call at any point for help. Building a new village will take time.\n\nOur budget is so much more expensive now. Our mortgage doubled. Our groceries have probably gone up by 30%. We were paying $2 for cereal in Utah, and now it's $10 at our local supermarket. Costco and Target are pretty close in price to what they were in Utah, but now we're paying for delivery fees.\n\nOur weekly spending has also doubled because we've been obsessed with eating out since we arrived, but I know that probably won't stick.\n\nSome things are more affordable than we expected. Public transit is affordable, and we no longer have to pay for car payments, gas, or car insurance. New York residents get in for free to most of the museums, and kids get in free for pretty much everything in the city.\n\nMy husband is 10 times happier because he's actually working in the city where his job is located. He's way happier, and I'm way happier.\n\nIt's always been my dream to make my kids' childhoods magical. There was this phrase I heard early on in motherhood: \"It's their day, too. It's their life, too. It's their childhood, too.\"\n\nI have the power as their parent to give them amazing experiences and memories. I always think about when they're adults, what do I want them to think back on and remember from when they were growing up?\n\nYou don't just have to do what your parents did or what your siblings do or what everyone in your city or neighborhood does. If you choose to, that's OK, too. But you can take life by the reins and change it.\n\nI hope someday my kids will thank me for these experiences and see the effort that their dad and I have put into trying to give them a phenomenal life.",

    "description": "I worried about moving to New York City because I wouldn't be close to my family. Thankfully, my sister and best friend moved into the same complex.",
    "fullText": "Every house has a unique smell that is said to be unrecognizable until you're away for a period of time. Despite the constant comments from friends and visitors about the smell of my childhood home, I couldn't have described it to you until I moved away from home.\n\nAs the oldest of three sisters who grew up with two nurturing parents and involved grandparents nearby, my home and family mean everything to me. My family has always been my rock: from attending my first Pride parade with me when I came out as queer in high school to having my entire family drive six hours each way to move me in when I went to college.\n\nSo, when it came time for me to pursue my long-sought-after goal of moving to New York City, I knew I would have my family's support, but it wouldn't make leaving any easier.\n\nI come from a long line of ambitious and driven people, so even as a kid, there was never any doubt in my mind that I would move to New York at the first chance I could. Following in my parents' footsteps, who also met and started their life together in the city, all of my childhood birthday trips and summers in college spent working in Brooklyn led up to the moment I finally got offered my dream job as a sex educator in New York.\n\nI knew nothing was going to get in between me and my dream, and yet the reality sank in that moving would change what my immediate sense of family would look like. Although visiting my family was only a short drive away, I didn't know what it would feel like to miss out on family walks with my dog, the never-ending late-night talks with my sisters, or the now identifiable oaky cinnamon smell of my house every day.\n\nWhile I wasn't sure what lay in store for this new period of my life, when my best friends from college, Elliot and Ike, found an apartment just a walk from my own, I started to see the pieces come together.\n\nIn the early months of my relocation to New York, I was finding my footing within the community and among friends. Despite Elliot and me living objectively close by, it was different from our shared walls in college. Nonetheless, we quickly ritualized our ocean documentary watch parties and park picnics, but this time in a new setting.\n\nEverything changed again when I met my now girlfriend. We moved in together, still close to my best friends, and I felt my own family growing before my eyes. Suddenly, the familiar sounds of living with my family started to take shape, but in a new tune: the jingle of her keys walking up to the door after a day of work, the pitter-patter of our cats running around the apartment, the rattle of the wind against our windows in the winter.\n\nI had found my home, and thought things couldn't get any better.\n\nAfter some time nesting in my beautiful apartment with my girlfriend, two apartments in my complex became miraculously available. It was somehow perfectly aligned with my best friends searching for a new apartment and my sister and her partner moving in together. Within a three-month window, I no longer had to wait for holidays and hometown visits to have family dinners or game nights; I had my own queer family in New York.\n\nMy move taught me that family can grow wherever you are, and mine happened to be right next door. Now, I feel the small day-to-day intimacies of living with family restored when my weekly grocery shop becomes a sisterly activity or when I can stay in my pajamas to borrow a baking sheet from my best friend.\n\nWhile I know this living situation might not last forever, there is something even more special and grounding in its impermanence. Just as I once moved away from home, it's possible that one day my best friend, my sister, or even I will embark on a journey that leads us elsewhere. But if that happens, I will always remember the smell of vanilla in my best friend's apartment or the herbal scent of my sister's studio and think of my neighbors, friends, and family.",

    "title": "Airlines are canceling flights ahead of a winter storm. Here's what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled.",
    "description": "As a snow storm heads toward the New York City area, airlines are delaying and canceling thousands of flights.",
    "fullText": "A winter storm expected to hit the Northeast is causing thousands of flight delays and cancellations.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for areas around New York City, extending into Connecticut and New Jersey. The service expects heavy snow accumulations between six and nine inches.\n\nAbout 1,400 flights in the US have been canceled, as of 2:20 p.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. Over 5,100 US flights have been delayed, per the service.\n\nAffected travel hubs, including New York's John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty airports, have begun issuing weather warnings.\n\nSome airlines have begun offering solutions to travelers affected by the storm. JetBlue, Delta, and Southwest have all waived fare differences for those changing flights from airports around the New York metropolitan area.\n\nThe delays and cancellations come during a high-density travel period around the winter holiday. AAA projected that 8.03 million Americans would fly domestically between December 20 and January 1.\n\nHere is the best advice for what to do if your flight is disrupted.\n\nAccording to the Department of Transportation, there is no law requiring US airlines to compensate passengers for disruptions caused by uncontrollable events, such as weather. That also includes air traffic control delays.\n\nThe only rule carriers must follow is to refund customers in the event of cancellations, even for non-controllable events. And that does not mean travel credits or vouchers — it must be cash, and includes any add-ons, such as bags or seats.\n\nBut carriers do not owe meals, hotel rooms, or financial compensation for storm-related cancellations or delays — because the cause is the weather, not the airline.\n\nPassengers are still entitled to a refund or rebooking on the same airline, but carriers are not required to provide additional accommodations or rebook on another airline.\n\nIf you choose to travel but your flight is delayed or canceled, ask the airline for the reason — ideally in writing — so you know what you're entitled to. Airlines have different policies for disruptions they control, like crew or maintenance issues.\n\nThe DoT's Airline Customer Service Dashboard — launched in 2022 — shows what the 10 largest US airlines promise in those cases, including rebookings, meal vouchers, and hotel accommodations.\n\nWhen a flight delay or cancellation is announced, expect people to flock to the nearest customer service line for assistance, and for the phone lines to clog.\n\nWait times can be painfully long, and the best alternatives will likely go quickly. However, some airlines offer the option to rebook on their website or mobile app and waive any fees, making it sometimes easier to make changes online than in person.\n\nIf all available options are exhausted, have a plan B, such as waiting to speak with a live agent, contacting the airline through social media, or booking a hotel for the night.\n\nDirect messaging on Facebook or Twitter can actually serve as a virtual placeholder, and you may hear back via chat before speaking to a live agent.\n\nHere are the phone numbers for each airline:\n\nFor controllable delays or cancellations that result in a customer waiting at least three hours for a new flight or requiring an overnight stay, several airlines will offer meal or hotel vouchers.\n\nCarriers offering both are Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines, per the DoT dashboard.\n\nFrontier Airlines is the only carrier that does not offer accommodations in the event of an overnight delay or cancellation, but it will provide a meal voucher.\n\nFor US airlines not listed on the dashboard, or in cases where the disruption is uncontrollable (like because of a winter storm), or if the compensation is unclear, simply ask.\n\nIt never hurts to request a meal or hotel during flight disruptions, and you might get lucky with a goodwill gesture from the carrier.\n\nSeveral major banks offer credit cards that come with travel insurance, like Chase's Sapphire Reserve or American Express' Platinum Card. Both offer trip protection, meaning customers who purchased their flight with that specific card can reap the benefits.\n\nFor example, in the case of a major storm system, it's likely many passengers will end up stranded in random cities across the US.\n\nHowever, banks with travel insurance included can reimburse cardholders for unexpected expenses outside their control, including hotel, meal, and transportation costs.\n\nTravel insurance does not apply in all circumstances, like short delays, so be sure to check your policy before making a claim — but it also doesn't hurt to make the claim anyway, even if the answer is no.\n\nDuring the holidays, it's easy to lose sight of your purpose — seeing friends and family or simply getting away from home for a few days.\n\nHowever, delays and cancellations are inevitable. Don't spend all day sitting around waiting — give yourself a cut-off time. Once that moment passes, consider alternative means of getting to your destination, such as driving or taking a bus or train (which may also be covered by travel insurance).\n\nIf you are stuck in another city and have no other option but to stay in a hotel or wait at the airport, decide how you want to spend your time and make a plan.\n\nEditor's note: This article was originally published in 2023 and has been updated.",

    "description": "Steven Carroll and his son spent weekends flying JetBlue for a challenge that once sent them from New York to DC to Florida and back all in one day.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Steve Carroll, a New York-based nurse practitioner who chased JetBlue's \"25 for 25\" challenge to earn 350,000 points and Mosaic status for 25 years by flying to 25 unique cities by December 31. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBreakfast in Massachusetts, lunch in DC, dinner in Orlando, and back home by midnight. That was one of the epic days that my 10-year-old son and I flew for JetBlue Airways' \"25 for 25\" challenge.\n\nIt was thrilling to plan and execute these trips, with layovers so tight we sometimes barely had time for a bathroom break. Finding a flourishing community chasing this challenge was one of the best parts.\n\nThe promotion, created for JetBlue's 25th anniversary, is simple: Fly to 25 unique cities in the airline's network between June 25 and December 31, and you'll earn Mosaic 1 status for 25 years plus a lump sum of 350,000 points.\n\nThere are some rules: You must connect your loyalty number to each flight; basic fares don't qualify; flights must be operated by JetBlue (not its partners, such as Cape Air); and only arrival airports count.\n\nStill, I realized it could be an unforgettable experience for my son Jackson and I. He already loves JetBlue (I think the TV screens do it for him), and his 100th and 200th flights ever were on JetBlue.\n\nPlus, Mosaic status until age 35 means he and his friends could enjoy the perks — like free bags, complimentary drinks, dedicated security and check-in, early boarding, and seat upgrades — on future spring break or summer trips in college. (Editor's note: You must be a Mosaic  3 member or higher to receive complimentary Mint upgrades and a Mosaic 4 for lounge access when JetBlue's open in late 2025.)\n\nThe math also checked out. Completing the challenge earned each of us a reward of 350,000 points, at least $3,500 in travel apiece, plus the additional points earned from our flights.\n\nCombining the cash I paid plus the 100,000 JetBlue points I already had, the whole challenge cost around $7,000, but I was essentially reimbursed in points.\n\nI started the challenge already holding Mosaic, but securing long-term status now gives me more freedom to put everyday spending on other cards and build points with brands like Hyatt via Chase.\n\nJetBlue's new partnership with United Airlines also means I can tap into reciprocal benefits on United — an attractive perk since we live close to the airline's Newark, New Jersey, base.\n\nTo maximize our time, we mostly flew on weekends and sometimes took up to five flights across a Saturday or Sunday. We took closer to 35 flights overall because of the overlap at some departure and connecting airports.\n\nOur flights stretched west to Los Angeles, north to Portland, Maine, and south to Fort Lauderdale. We've also checked off airports like Cleveland, Norfolk, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Manchester in New Hampshire, Raleigh in North Carolina, and Buffalo in New York.\n\nOur most ambitious weekend was over Veterans Day in November, when we planned 18 flights and 11 new cities. The government shutdown, however, canceled five of them, but we managed to rebook and still add several new destinations.\n\nAside from those cancellations and a huge delay that forced us to postpone a trip, the challenge has been remarkably smooth. And we've met a great community of people also clamoring for 25 years of Mosaic status.\n\nWe recently flew in Mint business class to Los Angeles as our 23rd city and completed the challenge on December 8 in Fort Myers, with about three weeks to spare.\n\nI already had a few JetBlue trips on my calendar to start, but then I created a master list of airports in the Northeast along with their city pairs. I live just north of New York City.\n\nThe goal was to create snaking routes that efficiently hopscotch across the US; we're trying to avoid international flying. I'd sit up in bed when I couldn't sleep and just map out my options.\n\nOver time, I've figured out a few tricks: book one-ways, sit near the front, and choose the first and last flights of the day. Most fares averaged about $100 per person.\n\nI have lounge access that made longer layovers easier, though I occasionally booked \"illegal\" itineraries with very tight connections. Connecting airports, regardless of the time spent there, count as unique destinations.\n\nBut before I risked it, I checked the historical arrival times. One trip I planned included a 12-minute layover at New York-JFK, but we still made it because our flight from Hyannis, Massachusetts, landed half an hour early, as expected.\n\nWeather-tracking helped, too. I adjusted my flight if I anticipated a disruption, which my status allows me to do for free. An unofficial tool called \"25for25.ai\" was also helpful; you can plug in your starting point and block destinations you've already hit.\n\nLiving in the New York area made the challenge far more doable. Airports, like White Plains, LaGuardia, Newark, New York-JFK, and Islip on Long Island, are all considered separate, unique cities.\n\nNew York-JFK and Newark are especially useful since they offer so many connections. There's also Hartford, Connecticut, and Philadelphia nearby. That's seven of the 25 we just drove to.\n\nSmaller airports like Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts require more creativity because they offer limited frequencies.\n\nOne of our biggest travel days began in White Plains, New York, where we flew to Nantucket and had breakfast in town. We then headed to DC for lunch at the airport, and finally to Orlando for dinner, also at the airport.\n\nMy partner joined us on that trip, making it a family day in the skies. We crossed paths with about 15 other challengers on our legs to DC.\n\nWhat was extremely helpful was the dedicated Mosaic Facebook group, where other participants in the challenge shared routes and road warrior stories. It's not hosted by JetBlue.\n\nThe challenge fostered a vibrant and supportive community. (Editor's note: JetBlue told Business Insider that over 500 people have completed the promotion so far.)\n\nMy son and I sometimes saw other challengers on our flights and ate lunch together in the airport between legs. We helped a family of four explore the town during our layover in Nantucket.\n\nWe exchanged numbers with almost every person we met so we can stay in touch. I didn't expect to find such a large and enthusiastic community, but it was one of the best parts of the challenge.\n\nI have a little tag on my bag that somebody made for me that says 'JetBlue 25 for 25.' When people saw it, they were like, 'Oh, you're doing the challenge.'\n\nIt was nice getting help along the way, and I appreciate being able to help others, too, as we cheered them on to finish by the holidays.",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants will travel to face the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 17 in a matchup widely viewed as a battle for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nBoth teams enter with nine-game losing streaks and identical 2-13 records, yet the Giants opened as slight road favorites earlier this week.\n\nWhile much of the conversation surrounds New York's draft position, rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart and the Giants remain focused on ending their skid.\n\nHere are three reasons for optimism heading into Sunday's game.\n\nNew York has rarely been favored in recent years, and it is difficult to argue against the Raiders being one of the Giants' most favorable matchups this season. Las Vegas ranks last in the league across numerous statistical categories, giving the Giants a strong opportunity to snap their losing streak and secure their third victory of the year.\n\nThe Raiders rank 32nd in scoring, averaging just 14.5 points per game. They have scored fewer than 10 points in five contests this season and have been shut out twice. The Giants' defense has faced significant challenges this year, to say the least, but this matchup presents one of its most advantageous opportunities.\n\nGeno Smith has been the most-sacked signal-caller in the NFL this season, going down 52 times across 14 games. New York's defensive front entered the year with high expectations, and while the pass rush has underperformed outside of Brian Burns, rookie Abdul Carter has emerged strongly in recent weeks. Carter and the Giants' front could be poised for a productive performance on Sunday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants vs. Raiders: 3 reasons for optimism in Week 17",

    "fullText": "The New York Mets have some work to do to replace star slugging first baseman Pete Alonso’s production after he signed a five-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nWith the offseason focus being run prevention, the team has opted to risk offense for better defense, hence why Alonso wasn’t even given an offer by New York. The Mets have brought in several players who are known for their defense and got rid of several players who aren’t known for their defensive prowess.\n\nImproving the defense and pitching staff is always good, but Mets brass might not understand just how much Alonso did for this offense. He averaged 42 home runs and 114 RBI and is extremely durable. He is the franchise leader in home runs with 264.\n\nInfielder Jorge Polanco was signed to a two-year, $40 million contract and the expectation is that he will split time between first base and designated hitter. Polanco is a fine player and a solid defender, however, he’s played one inning of one game at first base in his whole career.\n\nReports suggest that the Seattle Mariners were prepping Polanco for a move to first base but never made the switch because there was nobody to replace Polanco at second base. Third baseman Mark Vientos is the other player who is projected to see time at first base, but there is a premier Japanese slugger who is a versatile corner infield/outfielder that would be a perfect fit for the Mets.\n\nProlific home run hitter Kazuma Okamoto was posted to Major League Baseball free agency by the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) on Nov. 20 and has until Jan. 4, 2026 to sign with an MLB team. MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand named the Mets a potential fit to land the 29-year-old superstar.\n\n“A decorated slugger in Japan, Okamoto will be posted by the Yomiuri Giants this winter, making him available to big league clubs,” Feinsand wrote Tuesday. “Okamoto, who became a full-time player with the Giants in 2018, is a six-time NPB All-Star who has won three home run titles, though there will be questions about his ability to hit higher-velocity pitchers in the Majors. The 29-year-old has 248 career home runs in 1,074 games with Yomiuri, including six consecutive 30-homer campaigns between 2018-23. Okamoto has played more third base than first in Japan, though it’s unclear how Major League teams will view him at the hot corner.”\n\nOkamoto’s versatility would allow for the Mets to play him, Polanco and Vientos at the same time in different ways depending on matchups. If the rumored projected contract for Okamoto is accurate (four-year, $64 million), the Mets have plenty of funds to get a deal done if there is mutual interest.",

    "fullText": "Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. The Cleveland Cavaliers are in the Mecca for a matchup with the New York Knicks.\n\nThe Cavs and Knicks have a history of bad blood between them. Their meeting in the 2023 NBA Playoffs was a stepping stone for New York and a reality check for the Cavaliers. The Cavs have been carrying that loss with them ever since — and they are hungry for a chance to redeem themselves in a potential rematch.\n\nBoth Cleveland and New York entered the season as favorites to win the Eastern Conference. That might have changed recently as the Detroit Pistons wedge themselves into the mix and the Cavaliers struggle to get out of the gates. But make no mistake, these two rosters are still among the most talented in the East. This game could carry weight by the time the playoffs begin.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe Knicks had a slow start last season as growing pains muddied their process. But following a trip to the Western Conference Finals, a coaching change and some roster tweaks, they’ve gotten off to a much better start this season.\n\nNew York holds the 2nd-best record in the East. They have the 2nd best offense, 14th best defense and 5th best net rating this season according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nThis is a team that has found its identity and plays basketball like they trust each other. They can give as good a challenge as any.\n\nIt’s pretty simple. The Cavs have had a rough December full of low points. But after winning back-to-back games at the start of the week, they have a chance to really make things right with a statement win over their rival on Christmas Day.",

    "description": "With the 2025 Christmas break underway, the New York Islanders hold onto the third spot in the Metropolitan Division. In […]",
    "fullText": "With the 2025 Christmas break underway, the New York Islanders hold onto the third spot in the Metropolitan Division. In 37 games, their record is 20-13-4, good for 44 points. The 2-1 win against the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday leapfrogged the Islanders over the Washington Capitals, who sit at 43 points after their 7-3 loss to the New York Rangers. Islanders’ General Manager Mathieu Darche has his fingers all over the organization’s rise.\n\nIt’s a big improvement from where the Islanders were a year ago. On December 25, 2024, the Islanders sat five points out of the final wildcard spot. Sporting a 13-15-7 record through 35 games, the Islanders had just 33 points and were 13th in the Eastern Conference. With hindsight, it’s known the Islanders won the lottery and drafted phenom defenseman Matthew Schaefer with the number one overall pick. But at the time, plenty of uneasiness was in the air.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, fans were understandably anxious about the team’s future. The Islanders just finished the season with a 35-35-12 record, good for 82 points and 13th in the East. Five days prior, the Islanders were officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since the 2021-22 season. The Philadelphia Flyers handed the Islanders the final blow. Even if the official elimination was a foregone conclusion by that point, the feeling of the season officially ending after 82 games hurt.\n\nThe Islanders’ future looked bleak. Fans soured on longtime GM Lou Lamoriello, and the Islanders organization seemed to agree. Following seven seasons with the club, Lamoriello’s contract wasn’t renewed, and he was let go on April 22nd. The team was slow. The prospect cupboard wasn’t in the upper echelon of the league. There was a feeling that a new set of eyes was needed to steer the Islanders in the right direction.\n\nThirteen days later, on May 5, they won the number pick in the upcoming draft lottery. 18 days after that, on May 23rd, Mathieu Darche was chosen to be the franchise’s seventh general manager.\n\nDarche didn’t wait long to get started. At the 2025 NHL Entry Draft, Darche traded star defenseman Noah Dobson to the Montreal Canadiens for picks 16 and 17 and Emil Heimeman. Darche used those picks on Viktor Eklund and Kashawn Aitcheson, respectively. Both players are highly touted, and the organization hopes they’ll be making an impact sooner rather than later. Heineman, meanwhile, has been a perfect fit on Long Island this season.\n\nIn free agency, Darche signed Jonathan Drouin and KHL phenom Max Shabanov. Both players have fit in well in Patrick Roy’s new speed-first system. Shabanov specifically has been leaned on by Roy at times to generate offense.\n\nDarche signing David Rittich was an under-the-radar move that has proven to be worth its weight in gold. Rittich was originally supposed to be a temporary backup solution while Semyon Varlamov heals from his injury. He’s been excellent on Long Island through three months of the season. According to HockeyStats.com, Rittich boasts a +11.2 goals saved above expected in thirteen appearances, 15th best in the NHL. Rittich is sporting an 8-3-2 record with a .913 save percentage. His play has taken some of the workload off Ilya Sorokin, who has himself been excellent for the Islanders in a return to form.\n\nMathieu Darche’s first few months as Islanders GM are going well. The team is much faster than it was a year ago. They’re up eleven points on last year’s team. The Islanders can’t rest on their laurels with how tight the Eastern Conference is, but morale is high. If the Islanders keep their playoff spot past game 82, Darche should be in contention for one of the final GM of the Year spots. It’ll be difficult to beat out names such as Chris MacFarland, whose Colorado Avalanche are tearing through the NHL with a 27-2-7 record, but Darche should be given his flowers.\n\nIn twelve months, the New York Islanders have turned on a dime. From a team in murky waters to a speedy and winning roster that is buying in. He’ll get lost in the shuffle, but Mathieu Darche deserves praise for what he’s done on Long Island in the early goings of his GM tenure.\n\nHabs Daily: Merry Christmas, Hutson Surprises Community\n\nGreen Bay Packers Could Have a Hard Time Keeping Upcoming Free Agent\n\nRumor Points to Huge BOS Celtics Addition For NBA Finals Run",

    "fullText": "As the New York Giants prepare for their Christmas week matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders, interim head coach Mike Kafka expressed full confidence in rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart's ability to rebound from last week's disappointing performance.\n\n\"Really, Jaxson, the whole offensive unit, myself, we all are -- obviously, last week's performance wasn't to our standard,\" Kafka told reporters Wednesday. \"So, we came back to work today and yesterday dialed in on the game plan and emphasized the things that we need to get corrected.\n\n\"Today's a great day, a good work day in terms of getting out on the field, full speed, the timing, the rhythm, the communication, ramping that up as well... I'm expecting and anticipating a good work day today.\"\n\nKafka, drawing from his experience coaching Patrick Mahomes in Kansas City, emphasized the importance of the coach-quarterback relationship in navigating ups and downs.\n\n\"It's extremely important,\" he said. \"I've been in those situations, seeing the game through the helmet that way and being able to give them my experiences, not only as a player but also as a coach and having to go through those ebbs and flows of a season or a game or a quarter or a series or a play.\"\n\nWhen asked if he was curious about Dart's response to his first major struggle, Kafka was unequivocal.\n\n\"No, I wouldn't say I was curious. I knew exactly how he would respond, like he would respond to anything. The highs, the lows, he would respond the same way, with great attention to detail, urgency to get better,\" he said. \"Jaxson's had that approach, our whole offense has had that approach, and he's the leader of the ship.\"\n\nKafka also stressed consistent messaging.\n\n\"The messaging is consistent. The highs and the lows, they're all consistent. Where are the opportunities that we can learn from? Where are the opportunities we can grow from? And there's plenty of things that he did well in that game, too,\" he said. \"So, I think the consistency of that dialogue and really where the points of emphasis for that game, kind of turning the page, and now what can we do to apply those same learning tools to this game?\"\n\nAddressing speculation about Dart's freelance style being constrained, Kafka pushed back firmly.\n\n\"We want to give our players the ability to express themselves on the field to the best of their abilities and let their natural ability show,\" he said. \"You take those rules, and then you give it to the players, and then they elevate it, and they put their own stamp on it.\"\n\nHe added that he has heard no frustration from the rookie.\n\n\"No, no, we talk almost every day on a personal level, and then obviously on a football level,\" Kafka said. \"I'm right there arm-in-arm with him in terms of our operation.\"\n\nWith two games remaining in a challenging season, Kafka believes Dart and the offense are poised for a strong response.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants' Mike Kafka expects bounce-back game from Jaxson Dart",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Days after Ghislaine Maxwell asked a judge to immediately free her from a 20-year prison sentence, the public release of grand jury transcripts from her sex trafficking case returned the spotlight to victims whose allegations helped land her behind bars.\n\nThe disclosure of the transcripts as part of the Justice Department’s ongoing release of its investigative files on Maxwell and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein exposed how an FBI agent told grand jurors about Maxwell's critical role in Epstein’s decades-long sexual abuse of girls and young women.\n\nMaxwell, a British socialite and publishing heir, was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021 after four women told a federal jury in New York City about how she and Epstein abused them in the 1990s and early 2000s. Epstein never went to trial. He was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges and killed himself a month later in his cell at a Manhattan federal jail.\n\nTwo weeks ago, as the Justice Department prepared to begin releasing what are commonly known as the Epstein files, Maxwell filed a habeas petition, asking a federal judge to free her on grounds that “substantial new evidence” has emerged proving that constitutional violations spoiled her trial.\n\nMaxwell claimed exonerating information was withheld and that witnesses lied in their testimony. She filed the petition on her own, without the assistance of a lawyer.\n\nThis week, the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, scolded Maxwell for failing to remove victim names and other identifying information from her court papers. He said future filings must be kept sealed and out of public view until they have been reviewed and redacted to protect victims' identities.\n\nVictims fear Maxwell will be pardoned\n\nEpstein accuser Danielle Bensky said the release of records has only sharpened the focus on Maxwell’s crimes among their victims. Bensky said she's been involved in daily discussions with about two dozen other victims that make clear Maxwell “is a criminal who was 1,000% engaged in sexual acts.\"\n\n“I’ve heard things that would make your blood curdle. I just had a conversation with a survivor last night who said she was the puppeteer,” Bensky said.\n\nBensky said she was sexually abused by Epstein two decades ago. She said she was never personally abused by Maxwell.\n\nDelayed and heavily redacted files\n\nThe transcripts of grand jury proceedings that resulted in Maxwell's indictment were released this week in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law enacted last month after months of public and political pressure.\n\nThe Justice Department has been periodically posting records after acknowledging it would miss last Friday’s congressionally mandated deadline to release all records. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring victims’ names and other identifying information.\n\nOn Wednesday, the department said it may need a “few more weeks” to release the full trove after suddenly discovering more than a million potentially relevant documents. It was a stunning development after department officials suggested months ago that they'd already accounted for the vast universe of Epstein-related materials.\n\nSome of the Epstein and Maxwell grand jury records were initially released with heavy redactions — A 119-page document marked “Grand Jury-NY” — was entirely blacked out. Updated versions were posted over the weekend.\n\nFBI agent testifies Maxwell manipulated young girl\n\nAn FBI agent’s grand jury testimony, describing interviews conducted with Epstein victims, foreshadowed trial testimony a year later from four women who described Maxwell's role in their sexual abuse from 1994 to 2004.\n\nThe agent told of a woman who described meeting Maxwell and Epstein as a 14-year-old attending a Michigan summer arts camp in 1994. Flight logs showed Epstein and Maxwell went to the school sponsoring the camp because Epstein was a donor.\n\nAccording to the agent, whose name was redacted from the transcript, the girl had a chance encounter with Epstein and Maxwell one day. After learning that the girl was from Palm Beach, Florida, Epstein mentioned that he sometimes gave scholarships to students and they requested her phone number, the agent said.\n\nOnce home, the girl visited Epstein's estate with her mother for tea and the mother was impressed when Epstein said he provided scholarships, enough so that the mother said Epstein was like a “godfather,” the agent said.\n\nThe agent said the girl began regularly going to the estate as Epstein and Maxwell “groomed” her with gifts and trips to the movies, and Epstein began paying for voice lessons and giving her money that he said she should give to her struggling mother.\n\nThe agent said the girl thought her relationship with Epstein and Maxwell was strange, “but Maxwell normalized it for her. She was like a cool, older sister and made comments like, ‘This is what grownups do.’”\n\nEventually, the agent testified, the girl saw Maxwell topless at the pool. After she revealed that she hoped to be an actor and a model, Epstein told her he was best friends with the owner of Victoria's Secret and that she'll have to learn to be comfortable in her underwear and not be a prude, the agent said.\n\nThen, the agent said, the girl asked Epstein what he meant by that and the financier pulled her into his lap and masturbated. After that, the agent added, the girl's encounters with Epstein began to include sexual contact, particularly in his massage room.\n\nMaxwell was sometimes there with other girls, the agent said. One of the girls would begin massaging Epstein and Maxwell would tease the girls, the agent said.\n\n“She’d grab the girl’s breasts, and she would direct the girls on what to do,” the agent said, relaying the girl’s account. Maxwell's attitude during the encounters was ”very casual; she acted like this was normal,\" the agent said.\n\nThe released testimony appeared to reflect the testimony at Maxwell's 2021 trial by a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane.”\n\nAt trial, Jane said Maxwell also participated in group sessions between multiple females and Epstein that usually began with Epstein or Maxwell leading them all into a bedroom or a massage room at the Palm Beach residence.",

Road conditions are expected to be slippery, with even hazardous conditions affecting traffic, the NWS wrote in a probabilistic weather forecast.\n\n“New York is no stranger to snow and cold weather, and given the Christmas holidays, it’s important to be extra prepared before getting on the road,” Governor Hochul said. “As always, I urge New Yorkers to monitor their local forecast and text their county or borough name to our weather and emergency alerts system. Stay vigilant, drive slowly if you need to travel, and have a safe holiday weekend.”\n\nThose with travel commitments are encouraged to follow these safety tips.\n\nMonitor the forecast for the area you may be traveling to\n\nMake sure your car is stocked with survival gear like blankets, a shovel, a flashlight and extra batteries, extra warm clothing, a set of tire chains, battery booster cables, quick energy foods, and brightly colored cloth to use as a distress flag\n\nKeep your cell phone battery charged and keep it with you whenever traveling\n\nMatthew Euzarraga is a multimedia journalist from El Paso, Texas.

    "description": "A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.  U.S. District Judge Anne M.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.\n\nThe Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing “illegal aliens over American citizens.”\n\n“As I said from the start, our laws protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe,” James said in a statement Friday. “I will always stand up for New Yorkers and the rule of law.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for the Justice Department.\n\nNardacci, appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, wrote that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the Green Light Law as a policy matter. Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration’s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.\n\nThe administration, she wrote, has “failed to state such a claim.”\n\nThe Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\n\nUnder the law, people who don’t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver’s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a “standard driver’s license.” It does not apply to commercial driver’s licenses.\n\nThe Justice Department’s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as “a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.” It highlighted a provision that requires the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.\n\nIn 2020, during Trump’s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\n\nThe governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.\n\nIn the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York’s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk’s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information “remains available to federal immigration authorities” through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",

    "description": "Scott Morrow’s time with the New York Rangers has been a rollercoaster ride this season, but there’s one aspect about his character that you can’t take away.",
    "fullText": "Scott Morrow’s time with the New York Rangers has been a rollercoaster ride this season, but there’s one aspect about his character that you can’t take away.\n\nWhen the Rangers acquired Morrow from the Carolina Hurricanes as part of the sign-and-trade deal involving K’Andre Miller, they were getting a player who was highly successful in the NCAA and American Hockey League level, largely due to his ability to create offense as a defenseman, but he had yet to etch his mark in the NHL.\n\nDespite failing to make the Rangers’ roster out of training camp, Morrow was called up a couple of times, and once Adam Fox landed on long-term injured reserve with an upper-body injury, Morrow got the opportunity to step into the lineup and play a prominent role.\n\nWhen asked about what he wanted to see from Morrow shortly after Fox’s injury, Sullivan gave a blunt answer, a sign that he was simply expecting more out of the young defenseman.\n\n“Assertive play,” Sullivan said about what he wants to see from Morrow. “Making decisions with conviction and not being in between. Eliminating hesitation from his game.”\n\nSince Sullivan’s request for Morrow to play with more assertiveness, he’s been in the lineup for nine games, which has come with its highs and lows.\n\nEven though the 23-year-old defenseman has specialized in the power play at practically every level of hockey, Sullivan decided to utilize a five-forward power-play unit upon Fox’s absence.\n\nAt first, Sullivan didn’t fully trust Morrow to quarterback the first power-play unit.\n\n“We don't think that's the strength of their games to this point,” Sullivan said of why Schneider or Morrow are not playing on the first power-play unit. “We're trying to put a power play together that we think gives us the best opportunity to have success. Obviously, Foxy, I think, is an elite power-play defenseman, with how he distributes the puck up there, the way he sees the game. He's got really good instincts. We don't necessarily think that that's the strength of some of the guys you just mentioned.”\n\nSullivan did emphasize that Morrow was the most equipped defenseman outside of Fox to play on the man advantage.\n\n“We’ve made a decision to go with five forwards at this point, but we know that if we were to use a defensemen, he would be the guy because of the instincts that he has,” Sullivan said.\n\nWith the five-forward unit failing to produce offense, Sullivan recently added Morrow to that first power-play unit.\n\nIn this role, Morrow has gone through a steep learning curve, committing some costly turnovers in the process, showing that there’s still room for him to grow.\n\nFrom an overall standpoint, Morrow has been prone to making some defensive mistakes. Specifically on Saturday afternoon in the Rangers’ game against the Philadelphia Flyers, Morrow committed two costly turnovers, the first one coming on the power play, which led to a shorthanded goal, and the next one taking place in overtime, nearly leading to the game-winning goal.\n\nThrough the mistakes, Morrow has continued to play an assertive game per request from Sullivan, earning his coach’s admiration.\n\n“What I'll say is, he's an incredible kid, and his ability to shrug off some of the plays and continue to perform out there, I think, speaks volumes for the character of what he's about,” Sullivan said. “He's a young player. He's going to make some mistakes, and let's be honest, we're putting him in some really high-profile positions, whether it be on the power play and overtime, things of that nature. He's playing a significant role here with this group right now, especially with Foxy being out, and so I think he's done a great job with just playing through the ups and the downs.\n\nRangers Put Scoring Barrage On Display En Route To Comeback Win Over Capitals In a season filled with scoring woes, the New York <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/new-york-rangers\">Rangers</a> flipped the switch on Tuesday night, scoring five goals in the third period against the Washington Capitals, en route to a 7-3 win.&nbsp;\n\n“I think that's what you get when you deal with young players, especially defensemen. I said this to you guys all the time, I think it's the hardest position to play, but I admire his resilience because that would affect a lot of young players the wrong way. When you watch Scotty play, if he makes a mistake, he shrugs it off, he learns from it. We couldn't be more proud of him for his ability to respond to those situations.”\n\nSullivan has continued to roll with Morrow on the first power-play unit and give him heavy minutes despite some of his defensive blunders, not trying to punish Morrow for mistakes as he continues to develop.\n\nOn Tuesday night in the Rangers’ 7-3 win over the Washington Capitals, Morrow played arguably his best game of the season.\n\nHe led all Rangers defenseman with a 2.50 Game Score, an analytical stat used to quantify a player's single-game impact, blending goals, assists, shots, penalties, faceoffs, and 5v5 goal/Corsi differentials (shot attempts) into one number, with higher scores indicating better overall performance in that specific game.\n\nMorrow clearly has the talent to transform into an impactful NHL defenseman. Now it’s about fully adapting to the speed of the NHL game and providing more of a reliable presence for the Rangers, something that should come with time.",

    "fullText": "After losing to the New York Knicks in the playoffs last year, the Boston Celtics know that New York isn’t going away anytime soon. The same can be said for any other hopeful contender in the Eastern Conference: to each of them, the Knicks are a legit barrier.\n\nAfter a rocky start to the season, which had New York’s decision to fire Tom Thibodeau not looking great, the Knicks have bounced back, stabilized, and begun to excel again. They already had a bunch of roster talent in place, of course, but new head coach Mike Brown has added some wrinkles that have improved the Knicks along the margins.\n\nOne of those wrinkles is the emergence of second-year point guard Tyler Kolek, who has received more opportunity from Brown than he did from Thibodeau.\n\nSure, part of this has to do with Kolek being a year older and more experienced, but another part of it is that Brown is more liberal with his rotation than Thibs, who famously plays the same six or seven players into the ground (and has found his own success with it, to his credit).\n\nKolek only appeared in 41 games last year, at a 7.2 minutes per game rate. The Marquette guard has already appeared in 25 games this season under Brown, averaging 12.7 minutes per game as Jalen Brunson’s full-time backup.\n\nOn Tuesday against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Brown gave Kolek his first career start, and Kolek did not disappoint in the slightest.\n\nThe 24-year-old lefty flirted with a triple-double, dropping 20 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists and three steals in a statement performance.\n\nTyler Kolek in his first NBA start:\n\n20 Points (41% FG)\n11 Rebounds\n8 Assists\n3 Steals pic.twitter.com/Qt1k6CWGFD\n\n— KnicksMuse (@KnicksMuse) December 24, 2025\n\nKolek’s growing confidence is a wonderful development for the Knicks, just as much as it’s a terrible development for the rest of the East. The Knicks have struggled in recent years to find a viable backup who can spell Brunson without presiding over a severe drop-off in quality. Kolek isn’t going to be Brunson out there, obviously, but he can more than hold his own running an offense, and he’s a threat to score, too. This means the Knicks just leveled up as a team when Brunson is resting.\n\nNew York was two wins away from the NBA Finals last season. If they can improve marginally, they can take a step further. Kolek represents a small improvement to the depth chart that might help New York take that step.\n\nHe might seem like an inconsequential element in the East arms race, but look closer, and you’ll realize the importance of Kolek’s rise.\n\nKnicks’ Jalen Brunson Responds To Foul Baiting Accusations",

    "description": "Manhattan's most popular tourist attractions during the holidays include Rockefeller Center, Macy's, and Bryant Park.",
    "fullText": "When you're a native New Yorker, one thing you learn is that while the holiday season in New York City is magical, you should avoid tourist attractions at all costs.\n\nThere are plenty of other things to do during the holidays — for every Rolf's, there's a less crowded, more fun bar like Paddy Maguire's Ale House.\n\nBut I wanted to see if it was all that bad, so in 2023, I visited some of the biggest holiday tourist attractions in the city.\n\nTourism has only grown since then. According to a report published in November by the city's Economic Development Corporation, 48,000 more visitors per weekend on average visited Times Square in December 2024 than in December 2023, and Fifth Avenue saw 27,000 more weekend visitors in the same timeframe. Seasonal tourism also brings $500 million in revenue to the city.\n\nFor my holiday tour of Manhattan, I started at Wollman Rink in Central Park, walked to the Plaza Hotel and the Pulitzer Fountain, strolled down Fifth Avenue to Saks Fifth Avenue, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and Rockefeller Center, continued west toward Bryant Park, and concluded my journey at Macy's Herald Square.\n\nWollman Rink, in the southern part of the park, is open from October through March. It's been a popular holiday destination for decades and has featured in numerous holiday movies, including \"Serendipity.\"\n\nI knew I was getting close to the rink, but even though I came to skate here in 2021, I had no recollection of seeing people peering down at me from a giant rock ledge.\n\nBut, lo and behold, when I climbed up to see what everyone was looking at, I was staring directly at the rink.\n\nYou can just make them out, but there are even more people across the ice at the other gate.\n\nWhen I skated at Wollman Rink, I found it was very disorganized compared to other rinks in the city, and I don't think I'll go back to skate.\n\nInstead, I decided on a hot drink.\n\nIt turns out that hot chocolate was just the thing to help me out.\n\nIn front of the door was a sign that said only guests of the hotel or patrons of the restaurant were allowed in the building.\n\nI watched as the hotel employee stopped anyone walking in to see what their business was and turned a few people away.\n\nA musician was singing \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\"\n\nFor a few years, the Pulitzer Fountain was transformed into an ice-skating rink with polar bears and penguins. They've since toned it down with some giant ornaments and lights.\n\nThis is the Peninsula Hotel, another New York City landmark.\n\nThere's also lots of legendary shopping on Fifth Avenue, from Bergdorf Goodman to Harry Winston to Cartier to Louis Vuitton and more.\n\nI shouldn't have been surprised by the crowds — New York City's visitor numbers have almost fully rebounded since pandemic lows.\n\nIn December 2025, 1010 Wins predicted 8 million people would visit New York City in the six weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's.\n\nYou have to be prepared for people to stop.\n\nSt. Patrick's Cathedral, the largest Gothic Catholic cathedral in the US, opened in 1879. More than 5 million people visit each year.\n\nEntry is free, which makes this a great activity for anyone on a budget. Plus, the church was decorated — there were wreaths and Christmas trees, and the main altar was covered in poinsettias.\n\nThe manger happened to be near an exit, meaning that stopping to take pictures here held up a significant amount of traffic.\n\nEvery way I turned, I watched people snap picture after picture.\n\nThe Saks Fifth Avenue I visited, which is actually on Fifth Avenue, is the department store's flagship. It opened in 1924 and has remained there for almost a century.\n\nThis year's display was called \"Your Story in Lights.\"\n\nThis year's light show is set to a \"curated medley of uplifting music.\" It runs every 10 minutes from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nThe store was selling ornaments and other holiday goodies back here, but I had to walk through the entire store just to get there.\n\nI haven't been back this year, but I've seen on social media that they've added some more decorations in front of the store.\n\nLego is a huge draw for parents looking to entertain their kids.\n\nIn 2025, the tree is a 75-foot Norwegian spruce from East Greenbush, New York.\n\nIt was all getting a bit claustrophobic for me.\n\nAlong the way, I saw Radio City Music Hall, home of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, but the street looked too crowded for me to even attempt getting closer.\n\nI'd recommend going to the Radio City Christmas Spectacular at least once. It's playing through January 2.\n\nBryant Park is home to one of the two largest holiday markets in Manhattan, the other being Union Square. I prefer Bryant Park since it's more open, has a better view, and is closer to where I live.\n\nThe last time I was there, it wasn't too crowded, but the same couldn't be said for this visit.\n\nIf you head to the Winter Village a few weeks before the holidays, it's a more enjoyable experience. But, as you inch closer to Christmas, it gets more crowded.\n\nThe lines were so long and densely packed that I decided I could wait.\n\nAccording to the 34th Street Partnership, the store has 1.25 million square feet of retail space across 12 floors and takes up an entire city block.\n\nMacy's moved to this location in 1902.\n\nI also felt guilty for getting in the way of other people's photos.\n\nWhen I returned an hour later, it was easier to sneak a peek.\n\nI just had to let the crowd take me where I needed to go.\n\nThey spare no expense decorating at Macy's.\n\nMacy's announced that Toys 'R' Us would be incorporated into its existing stores in 2021, ahead of the 2022 holiday season.\n\nToys 'R' Us returned for the 2025 season.\n\nThere were crowds of kids (not pictured) in the various aisles, at the play place, and inspecting the Funko Pops.\n\nThe toys were on the seventh floor, while Santa was up on the eighth floor.\n\nThere was a long line to meet Santa, even though you have to reserve a time to meet him.\n\nThis was the sixth floor, which was mostly dedicated to home and kitchen goods. I felt like I could finally breathe.\n\nNew York City is still my favorite place — and maybe everyone else's — to be during the holidays.",

The early 1:00 pm window gets the lion's share of those games (seven), leaving just two for the late window.\n\nThe two games in the late window could not be more opposed in importance.\n\nThe 4:05 game on CBS is a matchup between the league's two worst teams -- the New York Giants and the Las Vegas Raiders -- who both enter Week 17 with 2-13 records, scrambling for the right to secure the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nKevin Harlan getting Raiders-Giants means the number 1 pick is going to be decided by an incredible play at the end of the game that we will all remember for years https://t.co/Mf99zBppAX\n\n— Clem (@TheClemReport) December 23, 2025\n\nSome prognosticators are calling this game the Tank Bowl. Bottom line: The loser is the real winner in this one.\n\nThe second game, at 4:25 on FOX, features the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles traveling to Buffalo to take on the Bills and Josh Allen.\n\nNow, how many people do you think will be turning the channel at 4:25 from CBS to FOX? We're guessing a whole lot. These two teams could find themselves in the Super Bowl this February.\n\nThe Giants are on a nine-game losing streak and have lost 13 consecutive road games going back to last season. The Raiders are also on a nine-game skid. They are just 1-6 at home this year.\n\nNo matter where one turns on late Sunday afternoon, Tom Brady will have some influence and interest. He is a minority owner of the Raiders, and he will be serving as the booth analyst for the Bills-Eagles game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: The Tank Bowl: Will anyone watch New York Giants vs. Las Vegas Raiders?",

THEY ARE A TRUE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! Thank you for your attention to this matter. PRESIDENT DJT.”\n\nIt is unclear what prompted Trump’s latest attack on the newspaper he has long derided as part of the “fake news” media.\n\nHowever, the president and the White House were triggered for days over a November report in the Times revealing that the 79-year-old president has drastically reduced his public appearances compared to his first term.\n\nTrump, who is on track to become the oldest sitting U.S. president to date, is also starting his days later on average and working shorter hours than he did during his first stint in the White House, the Times reported.\n\nLast week, the paper also published a detailed report examining Trump’s friendship with the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, describing how the two “pursued women in a game of ego and dominance” in which “female bodies were currency.”\n\nIn one particularly damaging section, a mother who accompanied her 14-year-old daughter to a party at Mar-a-Lago with other young models claimed she was warned by Trump’s then-wife, Marla Maples: “Whatever you do, do not let her around any of these men, and especially my husband.” Maples denied making the remark to the Times.\n\nTrump also took aim at the Times during a Monday press conference, accusing the paper of insufficiently covering his plan to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nThe president ranted about the outlet while continuing to push a dubious claim that he had lowered the cost of prescription drugs by the mathematically impossible amount of up to “3,000 percent.”\n\n“A drug that sells for $10 in London is costing $130 in New York. We’re bringing it down to $20,” Trump said. “So we’re going down—you can do your own math, but it’s 2,000 percent, 3,000 percent. It’s pretty amazing. And, you know, the New York Times had a story about it, a small story, way in the back of the paper. It’s the single biggest thing to happen with respect to drugs probably in 50 years.\n\n“It’s the biggest thing ever to happen, and it’s barely covered in the New York Times because it’s a fake newspaper,” Trump added.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted The New York Times for comment.",

He's shooting 48.2% from the field, 37.4% from deep and 84.7% from the line.\n\n\"Brunson still spends more time with the ball in his hands than just about every player in the NBA, but as he adjusts to a new system that wants the sum to be greater than its individual parts, New York’s perennial MVP candidate is doing a very good job sharing the spotlight.\"\n\nNext for the Knicks was Karl-Anthony Towns, who moved up a spot to 20th. Below Towns was OG Anunoby at No. 40.\n\n\"Mike Brown has the Knicks jacking up 3s like never before—particularly Anunoby, who has found himself open enough, often enough to really let it fly.\"\n\nMikal Bridges ranked No. 52, a four-spot rise from the previous rankings. Bridges has had three-straight 20+ point games, including 24 points in a win over the Miami Heat on Sunday.\n\nThe Knick who made the biggest leap was Josh Hart, who jumped 14 spots to No. 78. Hart's averaging 12.2 points per game while shooting 50.4% from the field.

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are unlikely to be picking high in the 2026 NFL Draft unless they pull off a surprising trade. Meanwhile, two of their biggest rivals, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets, are expected to be near the top of the draft order.\n\nBoth Miami and New York might be eyeing a rookie quarterback in the first round. Pro Football Focus’s Gordon McGuinness released a mock draft on Monday that had the Dolphins moving up from Pick No. 10 to No. 1 by trading with the New York Giants to secure Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza.\n\n“Projected trade: New York Giants send No. 1 overall pick to Miami Dolphins for No. 10, No. 44, a 2027 first-round pick and a 2027 second-round pick,” McGuinness wrote.\n\n“With Tua Tagovailoa benched ahead of the Dolphins’ Week 16 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, it’s obvious that Miami is in the market for a new quarterback. In this mock draft, they get aggressive to move up for one.\n\n“Mendoza recorded a 6.2% big-time throw rate and a 2.3% turnover-worthy play rate this season, which compares well with recent No. 1 overall picks Cam Ward (6.3%, 3.3%) and Caleb Williams (6.2%, 3.6%).”\n\nThe Dolphins will likely be on the lookout for a replacement for Tagovailoa. With the upcoming rookie quarterback draft class not expected to be deep, Miami will need to think outside the box to move up in the draft and find its future signal caller.\n\nWhy Bill Belichick’s Possible Latest Move Signals He Likely Won’t Accept NFL Head Coaching Role This Offseason",

    "fullText": "Ghislaine Maxwell currently winters at Camp Bryan, a minimum security prison in Texas, but is hoping to spend the summer in a more fashionable location. She recently petitioned the U.S. District Court in Manhattan to vacate her 2021 conviction for sex trafficking minors. If allowed out, it’s unclear where Maxwell would live. She has previously resided in London, Paris, Palm Beach, and New York City. It was on the Upper East Side in the 1990s that Maxwell met Jeffrey Epstein and the two bonded over shared interests: social climbing and exploiting young women. Epstein provided the funding while Maxwell did the recruiting. Victims have testified that Maxwell trolled Florida spas looking to recruit teenagers to massage Epstein, reassuring high schoolers in her clipped British accent that nothing untoward would occur.",
