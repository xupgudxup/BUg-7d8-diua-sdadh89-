    "description": "Specifically pointing to Malik Nabers' return in 2026, QB Jaxson Dart expressed optimism that the New York Giants are close to turning it around.",
    "fullText": "New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart closed out 2025 with unshakeable belief in a rapid turnaround, pointing to the team's talent and near-misses as proof that contention is close.\n\n\"No,\" Dart said when asked if the Giants are far from turning it around. \"I mean, we've got the pieces. This is not an excuse, but obviously, we've had a tough schedule, and we've been in really tight games where this season could completely flip. So that's kind of just the league. It's those one-score games and who can capitalize on those moments.\n\n\"We've got a lot of talent. We have some good vets, and we have a ton of young guys who are going to continue to thrive. I’ve said this a lot, we just have a ton of excitement for the future because we know what this thing can do and how we can flip this around.\"\n\nCentral to that vision is reuniting with star wide receiver Malik Nabers, sidelined for more than half the season with a torn ACL.\n\n\"We'll for sure continue to be together and light it up,\" Dart said. \"I'm excited. Those are conversations that we have a lot, and we're two of some of the younger guys in the entire league at 22, so we've got a long future together, and there's going to be a lot of great moments. I know that he's been attacking this recovery process, and he's going to come back stronger and better, and he's going to be hungry for sure.\"\n\nDart admitted Nabers' absence stung deeply.\n\n\"He’s an incredible talent. He could beat anybody in the world. When you have a guy like that out there, he's a safety guy who's going to come down with the ball at all costs,\" Dart said.\n\nWith a young core headlined by the Dart-Nabers connection, the quarterback sees winning -- and plenty of it -- on the horizon.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Jaxson Dart bullish on Giants' future, excited for Malik Nabers' return",

    "description": "Yasser Salem has built a business council to advise Mamdani if he wins. The McKinsey alum explains that bosses are open to free childcare.",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: This piece originally ran on November 4, 2025, ahead of Zohran Mamdani's electoral win. We are resharing the story on January 1, when he will be sworn in as mayor of New York City.\n\nIf you read the tabloids, the eve of a potential Zohran Mamdani mayorality has turned Billionaire's Row into 1975 Saigon, with everyone looking to hitch the last flight to Palm Beach.\n\nTo put it more bluntly, the city's wealthiest and most powerful business leaders have some qualms with Mamdani's socialist platform.\n\nHowever, the story is not so simple, says Yasser Salem, a former McKinsey executive building a business council to advise Mamdani if he wins the mayoral election. Sure, the word socialism can cause some tension, Salem, the head of OneNYC, a pro-Mamdani PAC, said, but there are some surprising areas of overlap.\n\nSome, like Jamie Dimon, have softened their message in public as they've gotten to know the candidate. Similarly, in conversations with more than 70 CEOs, Salem told Business Insider that some platform planks, such as universal childcare, are acceptable to many in the city's business community.\n\n\"Some of them have said from the beginning that they understand policies like free childcare as a way to lower the burden of worry, concern, and issues that their employees have that prevent them from being productive at work,\" Salem said. Others took more time, but the affordability crisis is unavoidable.\n\nAccording to a recent study of public data released by his PAC, the average New York family spends over 25% of its income on care for just one child. The group proposes several public-private models for childcare, including some where the costs are shared by the government and the employer — an idea, Salem said, that has \"widespread support.\"\n\nBusiness leaders' main concerns aren't surprising: Mamdani's public safety plans will make the city less safe, and housing proposals will exacerbate the city's housing crisis.\n\nHowever, even in housing, there are areas of agreement, Salem said.\n\nBusiness leaders criticized Mamdani's plan to freeze the rent for rent-stabilized apartments, arguing it would worsen shortages, noting that Mayor de Blasio had tried rent freezes that failed to address the long-term crisis.\n\nStill, both sides agree the long-term fix is boosting supply, Salem said.\n\nThe difference between the business community and Mamdani is in their time horizon. Mamdani's rent-freeze message could help lower rents now and satisfy voters, while his plans for zoning reform and building 200,000 \"truly-affordable\" apartments can solve the deeper problem over time.\n\n\"Are we solving for rent prices going down in four years? Are we solving for rent prices going down today?\" said Salem. \"Because if you're solving for rent prices going down today, supply is not going to do it.\"\n\nAs far as public safety, Salem said the announcement that Mamdani would seek to keep Jessica Tisch on as NYPD commissioner has helped alleviate fears that the city would become more dangerous under Mayor Mamdani.\n\nBusiness leaders also wanted to know how Mamdani's new Department of Community Safety, which would deploy civilian mental health responders to subway stations and to answer some emergency calls, would work.\n\n\"For example, a McDonald's owner in a tough neighborhood gets somebody coming in causing trouble,\" Salem said. \"Do they call 911 and get a mental health worker rather than a police officer?\"\n\nThe answer, Salem told Business Insider, is that these changes will be \"additive\" and that mental health workers will join \"alongside, not replacing the officers on the scene.\"\n\nSurprisingly, he said, taxes don't come up as a big fear. CEOs told them they're willing to pay more if they \"feel that New York is a better place to live as a result.\"\n\nThe announcement that Tisch was staying on helped alleviate some of the more intangible fears of the city's business elite, too, said Salem, such as Mamdani's inexperience or his ideological commitments to socialism, or to the pro-Palestine cause.\n\nAnd Salem, who doesn't consider himself a socialist but instead a \"pro-responsible capitalist,\" also said that he would try to get CEOs to focus on their specific disagreements with Mamdani's policies, rather than focusing on \"labels\" like socialism.\n\nSalem tells CEOs that Mamdani is looking to expand the social safety net, not expropriate their wealth.\"He's not saying we're going to go from the corporate tax rate being 25% to being 75%,\" Salem said.",

    "description": "A New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.",
    "fullText": "United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addresses a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025 \n\nA New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart during which he seemed much more concerned with his appearance than policy.\n\nThe Times published a comprehensive story about the Trump administration’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday in which it suggested that Hegseth began his tenure at the Pentagon “as something of a blank slate on the war.”\n\n“He didn’t have any of his own thoughts on Russia and Ukraine,” an ex-Pentagon official told the Gray Lady. “But he had civilian advisers who did.”\n\nOn Day 4, the freshly minted defense secretary sat at a Pentagon conference table as one of his coterie of advisers argued for an immediate U-turn.\n\nThe ideological godfather of the group was Elbridge A. Colby, grandson of the Nixon-era C.I.A. director William E. Colby. The younger Mr. Colby and Mr. Vance had been introduced in 2015 by an editor at National Review who thought they were like-minded. Nearly nine years later, as Mr. Biden poured billions of dollars into arming Ukraine, Mr. Colby argued that “we would have been better served to put a lot more of that money to use in the Pacific.”\n\nNow, it was one of his disciples, Dan Caldwell, presenting the group’s recommendations to Mr. Hegseth, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other military leaders.\n\nThe Pentagon, Mr. Caldwell argued, should pause delivery of certain munitions that the Biden administration had promised to Ukraine, because, he believed, existing stocks were insufficient to execute America’s war plans around the world. Nor should it use the additional $3.8 billion left unspent by the Biden administration to buy weapons for Ukraine.\n\nGeneral Brown did not speak as Mr. Caldwell wrapped up. He simply shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\n\nDuring a trip to Europe the next month, Hegseth reportedly made sure to powder his nose for the cameras, but declined to answer Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov’s queries:\n\nThe Ukrainians had repeatedly requested a proper sit-down. Instead it would be a brief stand-up affair in an anteroom.\n\nBeforehand, according to an American official present, Mr. Hegseth dabbed his nose with powder from a small compact. “Look commanding,” he told one aide. The handshake with the Ukrainian might be shown on Fox; the president might be watching.\n\nThen the standing meeting began, Mr. Umerov coming in close, taking his voice down to a whisper, assuring the secretary that he knew America’s political and security agenda might be changing. He didn’t ask for new aid. He just needed to know one thing: Would the U.S. military continue to supply the munitions Ukraine was counting on, the ones approved by Mr. Biden? Every delivery sustained the lives of Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines; every delivery that didn’t arrive one day meant those soldiers would die the next.\n\nAgain and again, Mr. Umerov repeated his plea: “I just need you to be honest with me. Just be honest with me.”\n\nHegseth allegedly offered Umerov only nodding.\n\n“He wasn’t pleading for the answer that he wanted, but just for honesty, some indication,” observed one U.S. official. “He was saying: You can trust me; you can trust us. Just tell me what you guys are thinking.”\n\nThe post New York Times Deep Dive Alleges Pete Hegseth Donned Makeup for Ukraine Photo Op — Then Ignored Counterpart first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — CAPITALS 6, RANGERS 3\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Tom Wilson had two goals and an assist to lead Washington past New York.\n\nWilson, who earlier in the day was named a member of Canada’s Olympic roster, got into a fight with Sam Carrick in the second period for at least his second Gordie Howe hat trick — a goal, an assist and a fight — since March 3, 2025.\n\nJustin Sourdif also had two goals and Anthony Beauvillier and Aliaksei Protas each scored for the Capitals, who have won two of the last three games.\n\nAdam Fox, making his return from long-term injured reserve, had a goal and an assist for the Rangers, who have lost three straight. Vincent Trocheck and Braden Schneider also scored.\n\nWith the Capitals tied 1-1 and needing a spark in the second, Wilson rose to the occasion. The 28-year-old came streaking up ice and leveled Noah Laba before getting to the front of the net and roofing a feed from Connor McMichael to restore Washington’s lead as he became the first Capital to hit the 20-goal mark this season. Minutes later, he answered for Laba’s hit, fighting Carrick.\n\nThe fight, initiated by Carrick, put the Capitals on the power play. Sourdif snuck a loose puck past Jonathan Quick, who had 21 saves, to end a 16-game goal drought to make it 3-1.\n\nFox responded with a power-play goal of his own soon after to pull things to 3-2 going into the third.\n\nProtas and Wilson, netting his 200th career goal, added insurance tallies late to cushion the lead.\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) — Steven Stamkos scored his 600th career goal and Nashville beat the Vegas.\n\nThe Predators, in the middle of a season-long seven-game road trip, won for the 12th time in 17 games, including the third of their first four on the trip.\n\nThe win put the Predators (18-17-4) above .500 for the first time since Oct. 16, just five games into the season, when they were 2-1-2.\n\nVegas, meanwhile, lost for the sixth time in seven games. The Knights closed their four-game homestand with a 1-2-1 mark.\n\nNow in his 18th season, Stamkos scored his 18th of the season and ninth against the Golden Knights since they entered the league in 2017. The game-tying goal was part of an unanswered three-goal spurt over five minutes that turned a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 lead for the Predators.\n\nNick Perbix, Reid Schaefer and Michael Bunting also scored for the Predators. Justus Annunen made 29 saves.\n\nFormer Knight Erik Haula, who is two games shy of skating in his 800th game, registered the 200th assist of his career on Bunting’s goal.\n\nMark Stone, who earlier in the day was named to Canada’s Olympic roster, scored his 10th goal of the season, while Ben Hutton added his sixth for the Knights. Akira Schmid stopped 15 shots before being pulled late in the third period for an extra skater.\n\nVegas forward Mitch Marner and defenseman Shea Theodore were also named to Canada’s team. All three of the Knights represented their homeland in the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off.\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Darren Raddysh scored midway through overtime, and Tampa Bay blew three one-goal leads before beating Anaheim for its fifth consecutive victory.\n\nTampa Bay coach Jon Cooper celebrated his 1,000th regular-season game in charge with his 595th victory as the longest-tenured bench boss in the NHL. The Lightning’s coach since March 2013 has also led them in 155 playoff games, won two championships and reached four Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nNikita Kucherov had a goal and an assist as the Lightning skated off with a win in the opener of their three-game California road trip when Raddysh converted a pass from Brandon Hagel, who had three assists.\n\nJ.J. Moser and Brayden Point also scored for Tampa Bay, and Andrei Vasilevskiy made 24 saves.\n\nMason McTavish tied it on a power play with 6:58 left in regulation for the Ducks, who have lost four straight and eight of 10. Jansen Harkins and Beckett Sennecke also scored, and Lukas Dostal stopped 24 shots as the Ducks earned a point for only the second time in six games.\n\nMoser opened the scoring in the first period with his first goal since agreeing to an eight-year, $54 million contract extension last weekend.\n\nAnaheim scored its first two goals off turnovers, with the 19-year-old Sennecke getting the 12th of his rookie season early in the third period.\n\nKucherov scored his 18th goal on a cross-ice pass from Hagel during a power play four minutes later, but the Ducks evened it again when Pavel Mintyukov made an exceptional play at the blue line to set up McTavish for his 10th goal.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Macklin Celebrini had a goal and an assist hours after being selected to play for Team Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics, and San Jose beat Minnesota in a shootout.\n\nCelebrini and William Eklund scored for the Sharks in the tiebreaker, while Minnesota failed to convert on either of its two attempts. San Jose has won three straight following a three-game slide.\n\nIgor Chernyshov had a goal and two assists, and Jeff Skinner also scored for the Sharks. The 19-year-old Celebrini got his 40th assist of the season, passing Mikko Rantanen for second-most in the NHL. Yaroslav Askarov finished with 20 saves.",

    "fullText": "Heading into the 2025-26 NBA season, the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers were consensus favorites in the Eastern Conference. With two months of the season in the history books, the Cavaliers no longer appear to be a viable threat, and the Knicks are still coming to grips with Mike Brown's movement-heavy system.\n\nHowever, New York still has all the tools it needs to be a serious playoff contender. As such, if the Celtics do embark on a deep playoff run, they may find themselves facing off against the Knicks for the second straight season. Even though Boston is playing some inspired basketball, New York would undoubtedly have the talent advantage at almost every position.\n\nStill, the Celtics have been outperforming expectations and have proven that a never-say-die attitude can work wonders. That's why the \"First To The Floor\" podcast recently spent some time discussing how much of a threat the Knicks are to the Celtics' chances of postseason success this season, and whether New York should fear a potential trap series against Joe Mazzulla's team.\n\nYou can watch the full podcast episode by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: The Knicks may need to fear the Celtics",

    "description": "Miami, Seattle, and Dallas are shaping the new creator economy landscape as influencers spread out from LA and NY.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood remains the world's entertainment nexus, but many next-gen creators have decided they don't need a Los Angeles address to make it big.\n\nMiami, Las Vegas, and Seattle all attract more top Instagram influencers per capita than LA, according to new research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm.\n\nThe top two by total creator count were LA (over 12,000) and New York (nearly 11,000), followed by Miami (about 6,000).\n\nOther major creator communities have formed in established film markets, such as Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas, which have emerged due to their lower cost of living and production tax incentives. But other top creator cities — Seattle, Las Vegas, Philadelphia — lie outside those secondary film markets.\n\nThe ability to create content for social platforms from anywhere means creators can build a livelihood from just about anywhere. Talent managers say that, apart from when they want a creator to attend an in-person event, brands rarely request a city-specific creator when seeking a partner.\n\n\"You do have people in LA and New York making the lion's share of the dollars. But now they're increasing everywhere else,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. \"Eventually, there will be a hot influencer in Idaho.\"\n\nLooking at cities by concentration of creators, Miami comes in No. 1, outranking LA and NYC.\n\nSome creators are drawn to places that already have a robust creative community, like Nashville or Las Vegas. Others want to be near fashion and retail, which fuels a lot of the creator economy. LTK, a major e-commerce platform that connects influencers to shoppers, is based in Dallas, as was Neiman Marcus for a long time. Dude Perfect, a superstar creator group known for sports-focused stunt videos, is based in nearby Frisco. Miami, where Alix Earle gained social media fame and often appears, experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes.\n\nCreators also move to be near family and for a lower cost of living. It makes sense for people building a brand based on themselves to work in areas that reflect their identity. The biggest YouTuber by subscriber count, Jimmy Donaldson, a.k.a. MrBeast, chose his hometown of Greenville, NC, as his base.\n\nDude Perfect has recently embarked on a major expansion in Texas. CEO Andrew Yaffe said there's no need to be in LA with access to top brands and talent there.\n\n\"We'll be here as far in the future as we can see,\" he previously told Business Insider. \"There's no shortage of opportunity for us here.\"\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.",

    "description": "The New York Giants are looking ahead to the 2026 NFL draft and here are some prospects they should scout during the New Year's Eve bowl games.",
    "fullText": "On New Year's Eve -- Wednesday -- bowl season kicks into high gear with five games, including the Cotton Bowl Classic, a College Football Playoff matchup. All 32 teams will have eyes on these games, including the New York Giants, who will have a top-7 pick in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nThe Giants could still climb up to No. 1 overall and are likely to trade down for additional draft assets should they pick somewhere in the top-3. Despite rumors and speculation, it's doubtful they target a quarterback with Jaxson Dart, a 2025 first-round pick, under center.\n\nWith limited games remaining, Giants scouts have one final major opportunity to evaluate top prospects in live game settings.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of the players the Giants should key in on today.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Iowa offensive lineman Gennings Dunker\n\nAlthough the Giants' offensive line improved in 2025, they still have some issues along the interior. Greg Van Roten is an impending free agent, and the team has an out in Jon Runyan Jr.'s contract should they decide to move on.\n\nWith that in mind, Gennings Dunker could intrigue them as a potential late-second-round pick.\n\nHere's what Bleacher Report had to say about Dunker:\n\nGennings Dunker is a rugged, powerful in-line blocker built with the right stuff, but will need to kick inside to guard to mitigate his middling movement skills. He has the traits to carve out a role and crack a lineup on his rookie deal in a run-first, play-action-heavy offense.\n\nDunker is a 6'5\", 315-pound offensive line prospect, who entered the Iowa program as a 3-star recruit in the 2021 class.\n\nDunker started 11 games in 2024 at right tackle, earning second-team All-Big Ten honors. He started 11 games at RT during the '23 season and one in '22 at right guard.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Texas tight end Jack Endries\n\nMichigan is a mess right now due to various off-field reasons, but that doesn't mean it will be devoid of prospect talent on Wednesday. The opt-outs on both sides will hurt, but there's still something to watch for.\n\nWhile the Giants don't necessarily need a tight end, they could look for some depth in the mid-rounds, and Jack Endries is an intriguing option.\n\nHere's what NFL Draft Buzz had to say about Endries:\n\nWhat separates Endries from typical move tight ends is his football instincts and technical refinement rather than raw athleticism. He finds soft spots in coverage with veteran-like instincts and has eliminated the concentration drops that plagued his freshman season, but his modest frame and average speed ceiling prevent him from becoming a true mismatch weapon against NFL athletes.\n\nEndries represents the modern evolution of the position where receiving ability often outweighs traditional tight end responsibilities, but his blocking limitations create roster construction challenges that could affect his draft stock. His consistent production and technical soundness suggest he'll find a role somewhere in the middle rounds, yet the inability to contribute meaningfully in run support may cap his upside as anything more than a situational contributor.\n\nMichigan RB Justice Haynes (may not play)\n\nGame notes: Michigan linebackers Derrick Moore and Jaishawn Barham, offensive lineman Gio El-Hadi, have opted out of this game. Meanwhile, Texas had 12 players enter the transfer portal, and several more opted out of this game. There are too many to list, so keep track here.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese\n\nThis is the big game of the day and one that will be heavily attended by NFL scouts. What makes it more notable for the Giants is that several top-end talents will fall right into their range (from No. 1 to No. 7) -- most of whom play positions of need. Moreover, several have already been mocked to the Giants.\n\nGiants Wire has covered safety Caleb Downs quite a bit, so we went with linebacker Arvell Reese in the player spotlight instead.\n\nHere's what Mel Kiper Jr. had to say about Reese:\n\nThis is a complete football player. Reese jumps off the Ohio State tape, playing the game like a veteran. I see natural instincts at the linebacker position that allow him to make plays most guys just can't make, and he has the burst to get home when turned loose as a pass rusher. Reese has been a big riser in this class.\n\nArizona State TE Chamon Metayer\n\nGame notes: Arizona State wide receiver Jordyn Tyson, cornerback Keith Abne, offensive lineman Max Iheanachor, and running back Raleek Brown won't play. Duke corner back Chandler Rivers, offensive lineman Brian Parker, and edge rusher Vincent Anthony will also sit out.\n\nGame notes: Utah offensive linemen Spencer Fano and Caleb Lomu, and edge rushers John Henry Daley and Logan Fano will not play in this game. Nebraska running back Emmett Johnson Jr. will also sit this one out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Prospects Giants should watch during New Year's Eve bowl games",

    "fullText": "Christmas and the NBA have been synonymous since the league’s inception. The very first Christmas Day game was played in 1947 at Madison Square Garden between the New York Knicks and Providence Steam Rollers. The Utah Jazz themselves have been a part of this great Christmas tradition, playing eight games on the beloved holiday.\n\nJazz fans have fond memories of the six wins and probably have forgotten the two losses they’ve sustained throughout, but which is the best Jazz Christmas game? To commemorate this holiday tradition, The Lead has done its research to rank these Jazz Christmas games from worst to best.\n\nDisclaimer: there are only a select few games that have footage to go with them. Each game was ranked by the story behind it, how the game played out, and what players made the biggest impact.\n\nWhen it came to the most lackluster of the games, the Jazz vs the Phoenix Suns was the worst.\n\nThe game was played on Dec. 25, 1982, and the Jazz found themselves struggling to defend throughout the game. At one point in the third quarter, they were down by at least 20. They did manage a small comeback, but it wasn’t enough with the score being 111-101, Suns.\n\nThe only bright spots in that game were the combined effort of Jeff Wilkins, Ben Poquette, and Danny Schayes, scoring 58 of the Jazz’s 101 points. Number seven is the Jazz vs the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe seventh-place game on this list was played on Dec 25, 1977, against the Spurs (one of the last years the Jazz were in New Orleans). This game was between two 70s basketball heavyweights, Pistol Pete Maravich and George Gervin.\n\nThough the Jazz were never really close to winning, they weren’t blown out, and it was a little closer in score. Maravich led the Jazz with 27 points, four steals, and four rebounds. Gervin led the Spurs with 31 points, two blocks, five assists, and one steal. The game also gets bonus points for being the last Christmas game for the Jazz before the move to Utah.\n\nPistol Pete Maravich scored 3,667 points in 83 games over 3 years at LSU.\n\nIf you took the nation's top 83 single-game scoring performances in the last 3 years(not including this season)you'd have a combined 3,465 total points pic.twitter.com/By7PJ7WoPh\n\n— BaseballHistoryNut (@nut_history) December 4, 2025\n\nFor it being the first Christmas Day game, one would think this game would be ranked higher. However, the games to come stand out \n\nThe Jazz had a record of 11-18, though it didn’t stop them from punching above their weight. What the game lacked in story points, it earned in style points – the game was a slugfest between the two teams.\n\nThe Jazz controlled the first half of the game, then the Rockets stormed back to take the lead in the third quarter. Magic happened in the fourth, and the Jazz squeaked by to secure the two-point win over the Rockets. Any game ending with a winning shot is worth watching. Sadly, there was no found footage of the game.\n\nThe leading scorer for the Jazz was Louie Nelson with 21 points, seven rebounds, and two assists. Maravich scored 19 points and added four assists to the cause.\n\nThe fifth pick barely passed the sixth pick by being the Jazz’s first Christmas win in the twenty-first century. The year 2018 marked a new beginning for the Jazz as Gordon Hayward left for Boston and Donovan Mitchell became Utah’s new star.\n\nOn Dec 25, 2018, the league decided to give this exciting young Jazz core a chance on Santa’s big day. They were paired with a Portland Trail Blazers team, looking to prove their dominance.\n\nStyle points for this game were quite low. The first half was quite close, with Damian Lillard putting the Blazers on his back. He ended up with a stat line of 20 points, four assists, and five rebounds.\n\nOnce the Jazz got control of the game in the second half, they didn’t look back. However, player contributions were quite huge.\n\nDefensive beast Rudy Gobert had 18 points, 14 rebounds, and seven blocks. He was aided by Mitchell’s 19 points, two assists, and two rebounds. Even NBA legend Joe Ingles contributed 15 points to the Jazz’s win. Any game with Ingles deserves to be higher on the list.\n\nThis next game had both Jazz and LA Lakers greats going toe-to-toe with each other. Even though it was a blowout victory, the Jazz beating the Lakers alone makes this game legendary.\n\nThe game was a precursor to an amazing Western Conference Semifinals series between the two bruisers that same year. Magic Johnson had a good game of 18 points, 10 assists, three steals, and five rebounds.\n\nKarl Malone showed the league he was Him with 31 points, two steals, and 12 rebounds. Current Jazz color analyst Thurl Bailey added 22 points and seven rebounds off the bench.\n\nNot only did fans see great individual performances, but they also got to see a shoving match between Malone and Johnson. This further added to this game’s repertoire.\n\nPlayed on Christmas Day 1979, the third spot is a story full of triumph and heartbreak.\n\nThe Jazz won pretty handily against their Rocky Mountain neighbors, the Denver Nuggets. How they did it was quite phenomenal. It was a tight game through the second and third quarters. With the game on the line, the Jazz had two heroes emerge to lead them to victory.\n\nThe first player was Jazz all-timer Adrian Dantley, who came in to score 27 points and four assists. The second player to make his impact was a little-known shooting guard named Terry Furlow, who ended up scoring 37 points, five assists, and two rebounds. It was the best game of Furlow’s career.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn’t the biggest impact he made on the league. In the waking hours of May 23, 1980, after partying, Furlow crashed into a utility pole, killing him on impact. Drugs were found in his system.\n\nLakers legend Johnson was a pallbearer at his funeral – a stark reminder of how fragile life is and how important the holidays are to see family members and friends.\n\nAt Terry Furlow’s funeral, stars like @MagicJohnson, Campy Russell, Greg Kelser, and George McGinnis were some of the pallbearers at New Jerusalem Church in Flint. See this vintage @flintjournal photo. He was truly one of the greats.\n\n— Eric Woodyard (@E_Woodyard) January 2, 2018\n\nThe second-best game was set at the height of the Jazz renaissance in the early 2020s.\n\nThe Jazz were set to face the Dallas Mavericks on Dec 25, 2021. Having their best record in years, the three-seeded Jazz were looking to show the league who they were. The Mavericks, on the other hand, were full of a young core trying to prove themselves.\n\nThe game was like two heavyweights dealing blows. The Mavericks would control the game, then the Jazz would make a run. Mitchell had a heyday even while being hampered by an injury, scoring 33 points, three assists, and three steals.\n\nKristaps Porzingis and Jalen Brunson feasted on smaller defenders, scoring a combined 54 points. It took a combined effort from Mitchell, the Flamethrower Jordan Clarkson, and the rest of the starting core to win in the fourth quarter.\n\nOut of all of the games, this was one of the most entertaining, with both teams having trouble keeping a lead. It also had great performances from individual players.\n\nIt was tough to decide between the number one and number two picks. Both were great games and featured great performances. However, number one was a better game with Jazz greats playing to their fullest. Much like pick two, the number one game was a back-and-forth conundrum.\n\nBoth the Jazz and Rockets were getting a piece of each other in the early half of the season. On Christmas Day, 1997, fans got to see a preview of an iconic playoff series. It wasn’t until the third quarter that the Jazz managed to keep a small lead.\n\nJohn Stockton robbed the world of a Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets NBA Finals.\n\nJordan, Pippen, Rodman vs. Olajuwon, Drexler, Barkley would’ve been must see TV and the Rockets owned the Bulls back then.\n\nRockets in 6 https://t.co/AEzZxM47rH pic.twitter.com/5ifMVJeO8I\n\n— V̷a̷t̷o̷r̷ (@VatorSports) May 28, 2023\n\nThe Rockets weren’t done and ended up coming back to tie the Jazz 101-101 in the fourth quarter. John Stockton took over and scored four major points to put the team ahead. Kevin Willis answered back with a tip-shot to put the Rockets within striking distance. Bryon Russell struggled off the bench but drew a foul to shoot two free throws to ice the game.\n\nStockton scored 24 points and tallied three assists, while Malone added 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Jeff Hornacek made a huge contribution as well with 20 points and nine assists.\n\nNot only did Stockton, Malone, and Hornacek outduel the likes of Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, and Willis, but it was a glimpse of a great Western Conference finals matchup, showing why this game is worthy of the number one pick.\n\nThe post What is the Best Christmas Day Game in Jazz History? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "fullText": "I'll never forget my first train cabin. Before I'd spent 140 hours on overnight trains in the US and Europe, I had no idea what to expect of my 30-hour journey from New York City to Miami in October 2021.\n\nFor my first overnight Amtrak trip, I was set on having a bed in a private space. So I spent $500 on a roomette accommodation — the cheapest private cabin I could find.\n\nThe 22.75-square-foot cabin contained two beds, a toilet, and basic amenities. Thanks to clever storage hacks, it felt like a tiny hotel room with no unused space.\n\nSee inside the most affordable Amtrak ride in a private cabin.\n\nInside the enclosed space with a sliding door, I found two seats, a table, and a bed above the seats that pulled down. The seats also pulled out into a bed.\n\nI thought this was a big step up from sitting in coach, where you get one train seat and sit with other passengers.\n\nI was also surprised to be able to control the temperature inside my roomette with a dial and air conditioning vents. I kept it cool, about 66 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFor dinner, I had braised short ribs, mashed potatoes, and a hard roll. While I didn't love the meal as it came, I made a little sandwich out of the ingredients, which tasted better to me.\n\nI decided to try sleeping on the top bed. I thought the available blankets wrapped in plastic were surprisingly soft and comfortable.\n\nWhile I found the train movement through the night a little unsettling, I appreciated the dim, blue light on the wall next to me. It was my favorite feature of the roomette because it reminded me of my colorful night light at home.\n\nAfter 30 hours in a roomette, I would book the accommodation again. But for those looking for more room to stretch out, I recommend the Amtrak bedroom.",

    "description": "New York Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka: \"I don't have any doubts\" that Jaxson Dart is a franchise quarterback.",
    "fullText": "New York Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka offered glowing praise for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart on Monday, declaring unequivocally that the young signal-caller has already established himself as the team's franchise quarterback.\n\n\"I don't have any doubts about that,\" Kafka said when asked if he believes Dart is a legitimate NFL franchise quarterback.\n\nDart, who entered the season as the backup before taking over as a starter, has impressed Kafka with his natural leadership that extends beyond the offense.\n\n\"I've seen Jaxson just become more comfortable in that role,\" Kafka said. \"It's not about forcing anything, it's just about being himself and leading the way that he sees it and bringing guys along with him. Those are the qualities that we've seen since the first day he's gotten here.\"\n\nKafka noted that Dart's influence has reached the defense, with players there citing his leadership.\n\n\"I don't think there's an age requirement for leadership, whether you're young or old or a veteran or one year or one month or however many,\" Kafka said. \"I just think if you have the leadership qualities, if you have the ability to, number one, lead yourself and then lead others, and guys will follow you based on how you operate and how you carry yourself, then I don't think there's necessarily like a prerequisite for that.\n\n\"I mean, Jaxson does a great job because he's just being himself and he's controlling what he can control. He's doing all the things that make him great and he's just being himself. He's not trying to be somebody else. He's just his genuine self.\"\n\nOn Dart's development, Kafka highlighted the typical leap from Year 1 to Year 2.\n\n\"I think you learn so much faster from year one to year two. You have that full season, you're in the NFL style, you kind of know how things operate. You've built somewhat of a framework of a routine on how you want to prepare yourself,\" he said. \"Now you have time after this season to go through, kind of refine the things that you want, how you want to operate in the offseason, and now you have some time to kind of look back and really dissect yourself and really can make some more steps to improvement.\"\n\nKafka, who has coached Dart since his rookie arrival, called him \"a pleasure to coach.\"\n\n\"He's been awesome. Learning every single day, absorbing as much information as he can, and then also putting his own fingerprint on things,\" he said. \"You see a player that's continuing to learn from the good, the bad, and then continuing to take steps forward... take ownership and take accountability and hold other guys accountable.\"\n\n\"I'm proud to be working with him and happy for him, and I'm excited to continue to do that,\" Kafka concluded.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Mike Kafka doesn't 'have any doubt' Jaxson Dart is a franchise QB",

    "title": "Backyard tiny homes are finally legal in New York City. They could be a boon for homeowners who can afford construction.",
    "description": "The NYC government has begun accepting applications from homeowners who want to build an ADU, including a backyard tiny home, on their property.",
    "fullText": "It's open season for some New York City homeowners interested in building a tiny home in their backyard.\n\nUnder a sweeping zoning reform Mayor Eric Adams signed into law late last year, the city made it legal for certain one- and two-family homeowners to add an additional home, also known as an \"ancillary dwelling unit\" or ADU, to their property.\n\nOn September 30, 2025, the city finalized its rules for backyard and attic ADUs and began accepting applications from homeowners, although the government is still working on the rules for basement units. The city estimates that the reform — part of its City of Yes for Housing Opportunity package — will help create about 25,000 new homes in backyard cottages and converted garages, attics, and basements over the next 15 years. But the success of the reform will depend in large part on homeowners navigating high construction costs and regulations.\n\nWil Fisher has spent the last year preparing for this. The former city government employee founded a Queens-based firm, Unit Two Development, that helps homeowners determine whether their property is eligible for an ADU and connects them with contractors and others who can help them build one. Fisher said he and his team have identified well over 100,000 eligible individual properties, and they've talked with more than 100 of these homeowners, who largely live in Queens and Staten Island.\n\n\"The rules of the road are now written,\" Fisher said. \"It was a long process, but for the most part we're off to the races.\"\n\nMost of the people Fisher has talked with are interested in adding an ADU to house a family member, including an aging parent or a relative with disabilities who needs care, or an adult child.\n\nMaggie Ornstein is one of these homeowners. Ornstein, 47, lives with her mother in a house in western Queens that has been home to five generations of her family since the 1800s. She hopes to build an ADU for her mother, who's undergoing treatment for cancer and is having difficulty navigating the stairs in their two-and-a-half-story home.\n\nOrnstein, a public health geographer, has consulted with Fisher and determined that she could legally convert her garage into a home.\n\n\"My dream for an ADU on my property would be something that would be accessible, but might also have a second floor where a family member could potentially stay if they wanted to visit, or if I wanted to be with my mom in the ADU,\" she said.\n\nAfter months of planning and big picture discussions with potential clients, Fisher is starting to nail down the specifics of what his clients could build and what it might cost.\n\n\"Now is sort of the pivot from the conceptual to here's exactly what it will take, and here are the cost implications of that,\" he said.\n\nOne inevitable obstacle homeowners face is the steep price of building in the city. Fisher estimates that adding a backyard unit or converting a garage will start between $300,000 and $400,000, depending on the project's size. That's compared to the city's median home price of $800,000.\n\nThe construction cost is out of reach for many homeowners who'd benefit most from adding an ADU to their property, said Thomas Yu, executive director of Asian Americans for Equality, an advocacy organization and affordable housing provider. Yu said there needs to be a much clearer and more affordable path to adding an ADU before the regulatory reform will unleash construction in lower and middle-income neighborhoods. He suggested tax abatements or grants for homeowners with more modest means.\n\nMany of the New Yorkers Yu and his team work with live in overcrowded homes with multiple generations of their family. They could benefit from having a home for an older relative or an adult child who couldn't otherwise afford to stay in the city.\n\n\"The ability for that generation to achieve independent homeownership is zero, particularly in New York City,\" Yu said of younger New Yorkers. \"So ADUs are the next half-step that's needed for that.\"\n\nOrnstein said she's been discouraged by the price tag on her potential project. She's also turned off by how extensive and involved the construction would likely be, especially given her work schedule and caregiving responsibilities. She's hoping to find some government funding to help pay for the project.\n\n\"It's so much more expensive than I would have anticipated,\" she said. \"On the one hand, you wouldn't be able to buy an apartment in New York City for what an ADU would cost to build. But on the other, it's really a lot of upfront cost.\"\n\nThe expense and hassle of adding an ADU might not make sense for homeowners who are just looking for rental income, Fisher said. But he expects the units will be easily rentable for those who want a tenant either immediately or in the future. Adding an ADU also tends to hike the property's resale value.\n\n\"As far as I'm seeing, construction costs are a little too high for them to be a slam dunk rental investment from day one,\" Fisher said. \"But for folks who have a relative or an immediate need that exists within their own family or social network, these are going to be good investments in the long term.\"\n\nADU construction is also limited by a slew of regulations. The units can't be bigger than 800 square feet or take up more than a third of a homeowner's backyard. The law also restricts basement ADUs in areas prone to flooding and prohibits them in attached homes, like townhouses.\n\nThe Regional Plan Association, a pro-housing nonprofit focused on the tri-state area, found that just 68,000 lots — 12% of the city's one- and two-family properties — are eligible to add an ADU.\n\nThe city says it's creating a \"one-stop shop\" full of information for homeowners interested in building an additional unit. The site will include a set of public, pre-approved backyard ADU designs submitted by architects, designers, and builders that homeowners can use to lower design costs and speed up the construction process.\n\n\"Efficiencies that can be built in are really going to be make or break for this market,\" Fisher said.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks are considered by the majority of the NBA as the favorite to win the Eastern Conference. Before the season even started, the expectations were high for the Knicks, considering the Indiana Pacers lost their superstar guard, Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nNow, the Knicks are not the number one seed, but they have the strongest chance of succeeding in the postseason. They also have a superstar who can carry them to victory in Jalen Brunson. With that kind of star power, it is hard to count out the Knicks in any game they play.\n\nDuring the Knicks' game against the New Orleans Pelicans, Jalen Brunson once again showcased his star power with 28 points and 10 assists. It was yet another superb performance by the Knicks, which is their third win in a row.\n\nWith that victory, they are only one game behind the Detroit Pistons, who are at the top of the Eastern Conference. The Pistons have lost two games in a row, which could mean the Knicks can keep fighting for the number one seed in the East.\n\nMore: Josh Hart's message fueled Knicks' historic Christmas comeback\n\nKnicks head coach Mike Brown always loves to hype up his players, including Brunson. He thinks that Brunson is good enough to be called one of the special players who can propel a team to a championship.\n\n\"You gotta have a guy. We're talking about a league MVP, and we have a guy. he definitely makes the game easier for everybody, for sure,\" Brown said after the game against the Pelicans.\n\nMoving forward, the Knicks will continue to fight in the upper echelon of the Eastern Conference. They are playing under heavy pressure because of their status as preseason favorites. The Cleveland Cavaliers have crumbled under that pressure this season, as the Knicks will hope to live up to the hype.\n\nWith how they have succeeded this season, including the NBA Cup victory, the Knicks can keep living up to expectations. It will be challenging, but Brown, Brunson, and the rest of the Knicks will do their best.\n\nMikal Bridges injury update: Latest news on Knicks guard's status vs. Pelicans\n\nKnicks star Is on pace to Join NBA’s elite crucial offensive stat\n\nNBA legend blasts Knicks decision not to hang NBA Cup banner: 'Celebrate the win'\n\nKnicks former NBA Draft pick gets granted four years of college eligibility\n\nSix New York Knicks featured in The Ringer's new Top 100",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf the New York Yankees are serious about landing another ace-caliber arm, Hunter Greene is the type of guy who fits exactly what they’d be looking for. He’s 26 years old, has elite stuff, and is under team control until 2029.\n\nHowever, that’s why prying him from the Cincinnati Reds wouldn’t be cheap.\n\nCincinnati has no reason to move Greene unless the return is incredible. He isn’t a rental, and he isn’t anything short of a star. He’s a prime-aged arm the Reds can build around, so any trade conversation would start with the Yankees giving up multiple top prospects.\n\nSB Nation proposed a trade that shows just how high the price would be.\n\nIn the pitch, the Yankees would send George Lombard Jr. and Elmer Rodriguez as the headliners, along with two additional prospects, likely from their upper-level pitching group. The Yankees' upper-level pitching is as good as any in baseball.\n\n“Given his age (26), ability, and contract terms, it’s difficult to find a good comp for the type of package it would take to pry him from Cincy. The Red Sox’s trades for Chris Sale and Garrett Crochet are fairly decent, the Astros’ acquisition of Gerrit Cole and Orioles’ move for Corbin Burnes less so.\n\n“At a minimum, it looks like the Reds could demand a pair of consensus top-100 prospects plus at least another pair less-heralded youngsters. It’s not a stretch to imagine the Reds demanding George Lombard Jr. and Elmer Rodríguez in addition to several of the impressive crop of upper level pitching prospects,” Peter Brody wrote.\n\nPerhaps the Yankees will want to add a bat with those prospects instead of a pitcher, but having another arm like Greene is never a bad idea.\n\nYankees should add former NJ HS standout, Tigers big leaguer with near .900 OPS vs. left-handed pitching\n\nYankees linked to free agent Blue Jays All-Star as huge Anthony Volpe upgrade\n\nHow Yankees' Cody Bellinger decision could lead to big trade rumors\n\nYankees 'Plan B' if Kyle Tucker, Cody Bellinger sign elsewhere revealed\n\nESPN trade rumor has Yankees acquiring two veteran stars from Twins\n\nYankees urged to swap Jasson Dominguez to Marlins for 6'5'' ace",

Injuries are already part of the conversation with Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodon, and there isn’t much if they were to be hurt.\n\nSure, the Yankees' staff is decent, but it needs to stay healthy.\n\nSigning depth helps, but it doesn’t change that reality.\n\nIf the Yankees decide to be aggressive, it’s likely going to be via trade rather than another short-term signing. They’ve shown a willingness to deal from prospect depth when the fit makes sense, and I’d expect that to be the case again this winter.\n\nThat’s where Freddy Peralta comes into play. The Milwaukee Brewers right-hander is under control, elite, and capable of handling a significant workload.\n\nHe’s the type of starter who would change things for New York.\n\nAlexander Wilson of Empire Sports predicted the Yankees will pivot in that direction once the lineup is settled and sign Peralta.\n\n“Once the lineup is secured, I expect Cashman to aggressively pivot to the rotation by targeting Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta. The Yankees and Brewers already have a well-oiled trade pipeline, established last winter when New York sent Nestor Cortes and Caleb Durbin to Milwaukee for Devin Williams.\n\n“While the recent move where the Yankees re-sign Paul Blackburn to a one-year, $2 million contract provides depth, it does not move the needle for a team trying to win a World Series. Peralta is the legitimate frontline hammer that helps protect a unit already dealing with major injury questions,” he wrote.\n\nIf the Yankees make a move, it’s hard to see it being for another depth arm. A pitcher like Peralta fits what they’d be trying to accomplish at this stage of the offseason.\n\nYankees’ Cody Bellinger predicted to ‘settle’ on $170 million deal amid quiet start to free agency\n\nYankees trade proposal involves George Lombard Jr. for front-line starter who throws 100-plus MPH\n\nYankees should add former NJ HS standout, Tigers big leaguer with near .900 OPS vs. left-handed pitching\n\nYankees linked to free agent Blue Jays All-Star as huge Anthony Volpe upgrade\n\nHow Yankees' Cody Bellinger decision could lead to big trade rumors\n\nYankees 'Plan B' if Kyle Tucker, Cody Bellinger sign elsewhere revealed",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Western New York’s latest winter storm has prompted Gov. Kathy Hochul to issue an advisory to caution commuters to stay off the roads and work from home if they can Monday.\n\nWith whiteout conditions expected at times along with wind gusts projected to reach upwards of 75 miles per hour — as well as the potential for flooding — Gov. Hochul is urging anyone who can to stay off the roads Monday evening, especially during the evening rush hour commute.\n\nWIVB News 4 was able to speak with Gov. Hochul on Sunday evening over the phone, where she also encouraged Western New Yorkers who can to work from home and avoid going out on the roadways.\n\n“Western New Yorkers, myself included, we think we’re tough, we can handle anything, but when you’re on the roads and there’s 50, 60, 70 mile-an-hour winds and the wind is blowing, it is a dangerous condition. And we want to encourage people if you can, stay off the roads, especially during tomorrow night’s commute from 4 to 7,” Gov. Hochul told News 4. “Just over the next couple of days if you can work remotely or stay home with the kids, forget returning that one item to the store that you don’t like for Christmas, you can do that later, just help us keep the roads clear. Stay home, stay safe.”\n\nAhead of the worst of the storm Monday, Gov. Hochul emphasized how her administration will continue to coordinate with local leaders to help keep Western New Yorkers safe from what’s expected to be, at times, a very severe winter weather event for parts of our area.\n\nA state of emergency that was declared by Gov. Hochul on Friday for more than half of New York’s counties remains in effect headed into Monday in anticipation of the worst of the storm.\n\nA flood watch has also been issued for parts of Western New York, as a slight risk of excessive rainfall is possible as a result of the storm. One to two inches of rain could cause flooding around rivers, creeks, streams and other low-lying areas.\n\nParts of Western New York could see between 1 and 2 feet of snow with this system, combined with high winds and cold temperatures. Snowfall rates of up to two inches an hour and strong winds will create significant blowing and drifting snow and near whiteout conditions in lake-effect areas.\n\nState and local leaders continue to coordinate ahead of the worst of the storm, taking steps to close certain highways where conditions could be very dangerous and life-threatening.\n\n“New Yorkers should monitor local forecasts and take caution to avoid travel in impacted areas,” Gov. Hochul said in a statement. “Plow crews, emergency management teams and utility personnel have been deployed and are ready to keep New Yorkers safe throughout the storm.”\n\nBeginning at 6 a.m. on Monday morning until further notice, an empty tractor trailer and tandem ban will be taking place on the following state highways in Western New York:\n\nI-90 (Thruway Authority Section from Exit 46 to the PA Line both east and westbound)\n\nI-990 (I-90 to State Route 263 Millersport Highway)\n\nRoute 400 (I-90 to State Route 16)\n\nRoute 219 (I-90 to State Route 39)\n\nThe City of Buffalo on Monday morning issued a travel advisory, effective immediately. The advisory was issued due to gusty winds combined with incoming snow creating “extreme whiteout conditions, reduced visibility, and hazardous travel conditions.”\n\n“City officials urge residents to avoid unnecessary travel, use caution if travel is required, and allow additional time to reach destinations,” the advisory said. “The City will continue to monitor weather conditions and provide updates as needed. Residents are encouraged to stay informed by signing up for BuffAlert, the City of Buffalo’s emergency notification system.”\n\nFor real-time travel information, motorists should call 511 or visit www.511NY.org, New York State’s official traffic and travel information source.\n\nRob Petree is an anchor and reporter who joined the News 4 team in 2025.

    "title": "Miami has the most top Instagram influencers per capita in the US, beating out LA and NYC",
    "description": "Miami creators, influencers, and social media personalities are finding success as the city becomes a creative hot spot.",
    "fullText": "Los Angeles has the entertainment pedigree, but there's another city in the US that's home to even more top influencers per capita: Miami.\n\nVale and Sebastian Genta understand why. The siblings and social media personalities moved back to their hometown of Miami in 2021, after spending five years in LA. The pair, who post about their glamorous lives and occasionally offer a wry take on influencing, wondered what their move would mean for their careers. They were pleasantly surprised.\n\n\"Miami was a completely different city,\" Vale said. \"The amount of events in Miami, the amount of people that are there, brands that are present, it's almost as much as LA.\"\n\n\"Many of us know each other, so if you go to events that Gucci is throwing at the Design District, you're more than likely going to bump into five to 20 familiar faces,\" Sebastian said of the upscale fashion and design neighborhood.\n\nThe Gentas aren't alone. New research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, reveals that Miami consistently ranks as the No. 3 metro area in the US by top Instagram creator count, after LA and New York City.\n\nMiami boasts over 6,000 top Instagram influencers. LA has roughly 12,000, and NYC nearly 11,000. (Seattle was next, with about 4,000.)\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm. Adler said that other platforms, such as YouTube and TikTok, showed similar trends.\n\nMiami still has a ways to go in absolute numbers to catch up with LA and NYC, long known as the centers of US media and entertainment, but it's punching way above its weight. It's only the sixth-largest market by population and the seventh-largest traditional entertainment market.\n\nLooking at the data another way, Miami actually has more top influencers per capita than LA.\n\nOther markets that regularly came up in the top 10 by this measurement are creative hot spots like Las Vegas, Atlanta, Houston, and Nashville.\n\nVictoria Bachan, an SVP at Wasserman Creators, said that for the new guard of independent creators, being in LA or NYC matters less.\n\n\"Take the biggest YouTuber in the world, MrBeast — he's in Greenville, NC,\" she said.\n\nMiami experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes. Creators found a growing number of events like Formula 1's Miami Grand Prix, which debuted in Miami in 2022, as well as the Miami Open tennis tournament and Art Basel Miami Beach, which offer places for them to be seen. Brands like Geico and Vuori also seek out personalities there when they want to tap into the Miami lifestyle and Latino culture.\n\nTop Miami influencers include breakout TikTok star Alix Earle, who gained social media fame while attending the University of Miami, and Xandra Pohl, a DJ and model. The scene features prominent food influencers like Samantha Schnur, known as The Naughty Fork, and Nico Norena.\n\nCities like Miami have also offered a haven for Angelenos struggling with the high cost of living in LA and early 2025 wildfires, Wasserman Creators' Bachan said.\n\n\"They're crunching the numbers, and a lot of them did pick up and move to Atlanta and Vegas and Miami,\" she said.\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.\n\n\"We saw a mass exodus,\" she said.\n\nLA is still the entertainment capital in terms of population. But this new data adds to the narrative of a traditional entertainment industry in decline.\n\nLA has lost ground in traditional film and TV, with the rise of lower-cost film hubs elsewhere. A growing number of A-listers have decamped for other cities.\n\nStill, there are limitations to living in secondary markets for certain types of creators. Being in LA or NYC is considered important in the industry if you aspire to be a Hollywood actor and want to collaborate in person with other creators and attend major events.\n\n\"Our advice is if you want to make money, have an address in New York and LA,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. Some managers also caution against moving outside the US, saying it can impact your ability to get brand deals.\n\nThe Genta siblings said they wish Miami had a bigger TV and film scene to help their peers who are seeking those opportunities. They started #NextGen Creators, an events series where creators can learn and mingle with brands.\n\n\"Many creators want to move on to traditional media, like hosting television, acting, whatever that may look like, and I do think Miami still lacks in that,\" Sebastian said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump struggled to offer much sympathy for the families of about 100 Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nAn estimated several thousand Americans have volunteered to fight for Ukraine since Russian dictator Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, with at least 92 Americans killed as of September, The New York Times reported.\n\nFollowing a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a peace deal to end the war, Trump was asked about his message to the families of the fallen Americans.\n\n“The message is so obvious,” he replied. “What a shame. They died in a foreign country. And some are celebrated people, they’re very celebrated. But it’s so sad that a thing like that would happen.”\n\nHe then immediately moved on to the next question.\n\nSocial media users quickly noted that the president hadn’t thanked the fallen for their sacrifice, praised their commitment to freedom and democracy, or even offered his personal condolences.\n\nMany of the Americans who have died in Ukraine were U.S. military veterans.\n\nMike Meoli, 71, was a retired Navy Seal and firefighter who traveled to Ukraine to train medics on the front lines. He was killed in November 2024, ABC 10 News San Diego reported.\n\nNicholas Maimer, 45, was an Army Special Forces veteran and Idaho native who helped train Ukrainian officers. He was killed in May 2023 in an artillery barrage, according to Military.com.\n\nIan Frank Tortorici, 32, was a retired corporal with the U.S. Marines who fought on the front lines. He died in July 2023 after a Russian missile hit a restaurant where he was eating while on leave, Task and Purpose reported.\n\nThe U.S. government has declined to provide aid to American fighters to avoid any suggestion of a direct clash with Russia, which is a nuclear power, the Times reported in September.\n\nBut some social media users argued that Trump’s barely-there compassion for their families wasn’t measured diplomacy—it was reminiscent of the president’s previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during World War I were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.\n\nAlthough he failed to offer much comfort Sunday to the families of Americans who have died fighting Russia, Trump did manage to heap praise on the man who started the war.\n\n“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, prompting Zelensky to raise an eyebrow. “I was explaining to the president [Zelensky], President Putin was very generous in his feeling toward Ukraine succeeding.”\n\nHe also said he “understands” Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire while a longer-term agreement is being hashed out.\n\n“He feels that look, you know, they’re fighting and to stop, and if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn’t want to be in that position—I understand that position,” Trump said.\n\nPutin bombarded Ukraine with over 100 drones on Christmas Eve and early Christmas Day, killing at least seven civilians.\n\nSunday’s talks were intended to address security guarantees and possible territorial concessions, and while both sides said progress had been made, neither gave any indication that a deal was within reach.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Here's a look at the studs and duds (and those in between) from the New York Giants' 34-10 win over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders met in the desert on Sunday afternoon in a game where the loser had more to gain than the winner.\n\nThe two 2-13 teams entered the game on nine-game losing streaks, and the loser would be in prime position to pick first overall in next year's NFL draft.\n\nThe Giants haven't picked first overall in the NFL draft since 1965. For reference, that's two years before the Super Bowl era began. That streak will continue as they will now likely settle for the No. 2 pick, or lower, after besting a depleted Raiders team that put up very little resistance.\n\nIn that 1965 draft, the Giants chose Auburn fullback Tucker Frederickson first overall. San Francisco then took running back Ken Willard, who would go on to be a four-time Pro Bowler, with the second pick. The Chicago Bears had the next two picks and selected two future Hall of Famers -- Kansas running back Gale Sayers and Illinois linebacker Dick Butkus -- in rapid succession.\n\nFrederickson had a solid rookie season in '65 and was named to the Pro Bowl. Unfortunately, he blew out his knee the next season and was never the same. He retired after the 1971 season.\n\nSunday's win was only the second time this season the Giants led a game wire-to-wire.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the studs, duds, and in-betweens from the Giants' 34-10 Week 17 win over the Raiders.\n\nThe name is pronounced Wan'Dale, by the way, if anyone is interested. CBS play-by-play man Kevin Harlan repeatedly failed to get that right, but it didn't matter much to Giants fans. Robinson ate up the soft Las Vegas back seven, reeling in 11 of his 14 targets for 113 yards, putting him over 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career.\n\nAs stated, the loser would likely get the No. 1 pick in next year's NFL draft. But after watching this outfit, one has to wonder if that will even make a difference. They made sure that they were as toothless as possible coming into the game, shelving All-Pros Maxx Crosby and Brock Bowers, along with top defender Jeremy Chinn, this week. A \"soft tank,\" if there ever was one. Fernando Mendoza should pull an Eli if the Raiders pick him.\n\nThe Giants decided to let Dart be Dart, and so did the Raiders. He took advantage by rushing nine times for 48 yards and two touchdowns. He also completed 22 of 20 passes for 207 yards for a 91.9 QB rating. If he can beat Dallas next week, we'll crow a little bit more about him.\n\nIt was a day to pad the stats, and Burns did just that. He recorded 1.5 sacks on the day and now has 16.5 on the season with one game remaining. He had four total stops and three QB hits on the day.\n\nOkereke led the Giants in tackles with seven and had his first interception since the middle of the 2023 season.\n\nBelton continues to make plays. He also had seven stops and an interception. The Giants have to seriously consider re-signing him.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Studs and duds from New York Giants' Week 17 win over Raiders",

    "description": "Should the New York Jets consider bringing in another veteran bridge quarterback this offseason?",
    "fullText": "The New York Jets placed quarterback Justin Fields on season-ending IR earlier this week. It all but guarantees the end of Fields' disappointing tenure in East Rutherford. The Jets could release him this offseason and absorb a $22 million dead cap charge by doing so.\n\nDespite the somewhat sizable financial penalty, Fields' pending release feels like a foregone conclusion. Fellow veteran quarterback Tyrod Taylor is on an expiring contract. Taylor probably won't be back with the Jets in 2026 either.\n\nGeneral manager Darren Mougey will be tasked with acquiring at least one, maybe two, quarterbacks this offseason. Currently equipped with two first-round selections in the 2026 NFL draft (and three more in 2027), the Jets could target a quarterback in this year's class like Fernando Mendoza or Dante Moore. With the Jets currently slated to pick 4th and 18th overall, that may require a slight but aggressive move up the draft order.\n\nMougey should also consider bringing in another bridge quarterback. Right now, there's no guaranteeing the Jets end up with Mendoza or Moore. Even if they do, an experienced mentor could accelerate their development.\n\nIn recent memory, rookie quarterbacks who enjoyed immediate success were experienced college quarterbacks. Jayden Daniels, Bo Nix, Cam Ward, and Tyler Shough were multi-year starters. Other successful NFL quarterbacks like Justin Herbert, Drake Maye, and Jordan Love weren't Week 1 starters, and in Love's case, sat for multiple seasons.\n\nMendoza has 945 career collegiate passing attempts (and counting). Moore is a first-year starter. Not making comparisons, but recent draft picks who busted like Zach Wilson (sorry, Jets fans) and Trey Lance were inexperienced and asked to do too much right away.\n\nKyler Murray, Tua Tagovailoa, and Geno Smith (imagine that, ha) are among the veteran quarterbacks expected to be available this offseason. Murray and Tagovailoa may not be \"bridge\" options by definition based on the financial commitment needed. But someone like Jacoby Brissett or Malik Willis would be an upgrade on Fields/Taylor while buying the Jets time to develop a rookie quarterback, or draft one in 2027 instead of 2026.\n\nMougey has big decisions to make this offseason.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Should the Jets consider bringing in another bridge QB this offseason?",

    "description": "Maren Droubay moved from Salt Lake City to NYC with her husband and five children. She says her family is thriving despite the cost of living.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Maren Droubay, a 32-year-old who moved from Salt Lake City to New York City with her family. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy husband and I are from the Salt Lake City area of Utah, and we have five young kids.\n\nWe appreciated being close to family, nature, and a city with a variety of dining options and entertainment. But we always wanted our kids to have more exposure to different parts of the world and different lifestyles than what we felt they were getting in Utah.\n\nUtah is home, but we found ourselves traveling all the time. We were always on the road. We used to homeschool our kids so that we could travel.\n\nWe thought moving to New York was an impossible dream. We visited a lot and loved the feeling in the city.\n\nIt took us 10 years before the opportunity finally presented itself when my husband got a job in New York. We moved from Salt Lake City to New York City on October 10, 2025.\n\nMoving our family from Utah to New York was probably in the top 10 hardest things I've ever done.\n\nWe lived in an older house, so we had to do a lot of updating to get it ready for the market, sell it, and get it under contract.\n\nWe moved from a six-bedroom home to a three-bedroom apartment, so we really had to downsize — everything from furniture and lawn tools to our two cars had to go. I decreased all of our clothing to a quarter of what we had.\n\nYou have to uproot everything when you make a move like this, from finding new doctors to getting our kids enrolled in school. I am so relieved that it feels so worth it. Every day, I cannot believe we live in New York.\n\nTo find our apartment, I connected with people through Facebook groups or Reddit who were looking to sublease or have their lease taken over.\n\nI posted, \"We're moving. We need three bedrooms. This is the ideal block radius we want to live in. Does anyone know of anything?\" One person reached out to me and said, \"I am moving that very month to a different neighborhood. My apartment has three bedrooms. It has laundry and an elevator.\"\n\nIt was like kismet. It's the perfect apartment for us. We had Facetimed and looked at it, but we hadn't walked through it ourselves until we moved. We were just living on a prayer, and it worked out.\n\nWe have a large bedroom at the back of the apartment that my three boys are in, and they're on a triple bunk bed. Our two girls are in the second bedroom, with a mini crib for the baby and a twin bed for my little girl that can be turned into a queen when guests come. Our bedroom is at the front, and we have two bathrooms.\n\nWe have an incredible view of the skyline and the Statue of Liberty. We put my kids in the room with that view. When they ran into their new bedroom and looked out the window for the first time, it was one of those core memories that you never want to forget.\n\nTo prep the kids for the move, we had a family meeting and asked them if they were interested.\n\nThey've always been good travelers and here for a new experience, so they were immediately excited. We had a family meeting every week, where we answered questions or showed them pictures of New York.\n\nWe also made a family bucket list for things to do when we moved. We've been checking those items off on Saturdays.\n\nThe sadness hit when we said goodbye to our house in Utah. It's the only house the kids really knew, and Utah has the only friends they have ever known. Their grandparents and cousins live there.\n\nWe just let the kids feel the feelings. They know it's OK to feel happy and sad or excited and scared at the same time.\n\nI was nervous about how the city would react to my family. Would people respond well to a family with five kids? Would our apartment neighbors like us? Would the people on the subway be annoyed by us?\n\nI have been pleasantly surprised by how kind 99% of people have been. I will get to the subway, and before I even fold up my stroller, strangers pick up the other end and carry it for me. Everyone stands up and offers seats to my kids, or older women have even grabbed one of my kids' hands and helped them on or off the subway for me.\n\nThe community aspect of NYC is so different from our experience in the suburbs, where you live in a lot more isolation. You're in the car and then back at home. In New York, you're required to interact with so many people and make connections.\n\nStill, it's been hard being away from our support system. In Utah, we had friends and family we could call at any point for help. Building a new village will take time.\n\nOur budget is so much more expensive now. Our mortgage doubled. Our groceries have probably gone up by 30%. We were paying $2 for cereal in Utah, and now it's $10 at our local supermarket. Costco and Target are pretty close in price to what they were in Utah, but now we're paying for delivery fees.\n\nOur weekly spending has also doubled because we've been obsessed with eating out since we arrived, but I know that probably won't stick.\n\nSome things are more affordable than we expected. Public transit is affordable, and we no longer have to pay for car payments, gas, or car insurance. New York residents get in for free to most of the museums, and kids get in free for pretty much everything in the city.\n\nMy husband is 10 times happier because he's actually working in the city where his job is located. He's way happier, and I'm way happier.\n\nIt's always been my dream to make my kids' childhoods magical. There was this phrase I heard early on in motherhood: \"It's their day, too. It's their life, too. It's their childhood, too.\"\n\nI have the power as their parent to give them amazing experiences and memories. I always think about when they're adults, what do I want them to think back on and remember from when they were growing up?\n\nYou don't just have to do what your parents did or what your siblings do or what everyone in your city or neighborhood does. If you choose to, that's OK, too. But you can take life by the reins and change it.\n\nI hope someday my kids will thank me for these experiences and see the effort that their dad and I have put into trying to give them a phenomenal life.",

    "description": "I worried about moving to New York City because I wouldn't be close to my family. Thankfully, my sister and best friend moved into the same complex.",
    "fullText": "Every house has a unique smell that is said to be unrecognizable until you're away for a period of time. Despite the constant comments from friends and visitors about the smell of my childhood home, I couldn't have described it to you until I moved away from home.\n\nAs the oldest of three sisters who grew up with two nurturing parents and involved grandparents nearby, my home and family mean everything to me. My family has always been my rock: from attending my first Pride parade with me when I came out as queer in high school to having my entire family drive six hours each way to move me in when I went to college.\n\nSo, when it came time for me to pursue my long-sought-after goal of moving to New York City, I knew I would have my family's support, but it wouldn't make leaving any easier.\n\nI come from a long line of ambitious and driven people, so even as a kid, there was never any doubt in my mind that I would move to New York at the first chance I could. Following in my parents' footsteps, who also met and started their life together in the city, all of my childhood birthday trips and summers in college spent working in Brooklyn led up to the moment I finally got offered my dream job as a sex educator in New York.\n\nI knew nothing was going to get in between me and my dream, and yet the reality sank in that moving would change what my immediate sense of family would look like. Although visiting my family was only a short drive away, I didn't know what it would feel like to miss out on family walks with my dog, the never-ending late-night talks with my sisters, or the now identifiable oaky cinnamon smell of my house every day.\n\nWhile I wasn't sure what lay in store for this new period of my life, when my best friends from college, Elliot and Ike, found an apartment just a walk from my own, I started to see the pieces come together.\n\nIn the early months of my relocation to New York, I was finding my footing within the community and among friends. Despite Elliot and me living objectively close by, it was different from our shared walls in college. Nonetheless, we quickly ritualized our ocean documentary watch parties and park picnics, but this time in a new setting.\n\nEverything changed again when I met my now girlfriend. We moved in together, still close to my best friends, and I felt my own family growing before my eyes. Suddenly, the familiar sounds of living with my family started to take shape, but in a new tune: the jingle of her keys walking up to the door after a day of work, the pitter-patter of our cats running around the apartment, the rattle of the wind against our windows in the winter.\n\nI had found my home, and thought things couldn't get any better.\n\nAfter some time nesting in my beautiful apartment with my girlfriend, two apartments in my complex became miraculously available. It was somehow perfectly aligned with my best friends searching for a new apartment and my sister and her partner moving in together. Within a three-month window, I no longer had to wait for holidays and hometown visits to have family dinners or game nights; I had my own queer family in New York.\n\nMy move taught me that family can grow wherever you are, and mine happened to be right next door. Now, I feel the small day-to-day intimacies of living with family restored when my weekly grocery shop becomes a sisterly activity or when I can stay in my pajamas to borrow a baking sheet from my best friend.\n\nWhile I know this living situation might not last forever, there is something even more special and grounding in its impermanence. Just as I once moved away from home, it's possible that one day my best friend, my sister, or even I will embark on a journey that leads us elsewhere. But if that happens, I will always remember the smell of vanilla in my best friend's apartment or the herbal scent of my sister's studio and think of my neighbors, friends, and family.",

    "description": "As a snow storm heads toward the New York City area, airlines are delaying and canceling thousands of flights.",
    "fullText": "A winter storm expected to hit the Northeast is causing thousands of flight delays and cancellations.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for areas around New York City, extending into Connecticut and New Jersey. The service expects heavy snow accumulations between six and nine inches.\n\nAbout 1,400 flights in the US have been canceled, as of 2:20 p.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. Over 5,100 US flights have been delayed, per the service.\n\nAffected travel hubs, including New York's John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty airports, have begun issuing weather warnings.\n\nSome airlines have begun offering solutions to travelers affected by the storm. JetBlue, Delta, and Southwest have all waived fare differences for those changing flights from airports around the New York metropolitan area.\n\nThe delays and cancellations come during a high-density travel period around the winter holiday. AAA projected that 8.03 million Americans would fly domestically between December 20 and January 1.\n\nHere is the best advice for what to do if your flight is disrupted.\n\nAccording to the Department of Transportation, there is no law requiring US airlines to compensate passengers for disruptions caused by uncontrollable events, such as weather. That also includes air traffic control delays.\n\nThe only rule carriers must follow is to refund customers in the event of cancellations, even for non-controllable events. And that does not mean travel credits or vouchers — it must be cash, and includes any add-ons, such as bags or seats.\n\nBut carriers do not owe meals, hotel rooms, or financial compensation for storm-related cancellations or delays — because the cause is the weather, not the airline.\n\nPassengers are still entitled to a refund or rebooking on the same airline, but carriers are not required to provide additional accommodations or rebook on another airline.\n\nIf you choose to travel but your flight is delayed or canceled, ask the airline for the reason — ideally in writing — so you know what you're entitled to. Airlines have different policies for disruptions they control, like crew or maintenance issues.\n\nThe DoT's Airline Customer Service Dashboard — launched in 2022 — shows what the 10 largest US airlines promise in those cases, including rebookings, meal vouchers, and hotel accommodations.\n\nWhen a flight delay or cancellation is announced, expect people to flock to the nearest customer service line for assistance, and for the phone lines to clog.\n\nWait times can be painfully long, and the best alternatives will likely go quickly. However, some airlines offer the option to rebook on their website or mobile app and waive any fees, making it sometimes easier to make changes online than in person.\n\nIf all available options are exhausted, have a plan B, such as waiting to speak with a live agent, contacting the airline through social media, or booking a hotel for the night.\n\nDirect messaging on Facebook or Twitter can actually serve as a virtual placeholder, and you may hear back via chat before speaking to a live agent.\n\nHere are the phone numbers for each airline:\n\nFor controllable delays or cancellations that result in a customer waiting at least three hours for a new flight or requiring an overnight stay, several airlines will offer meal or hotel vouchers.\n\nCarriers offering both are Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines, per the DoT dashboard.\n\nFrontier Airlines is the only carrier that does not offer accommodations in the event of an overnight delay or cancellation, but it will provide a meal voucher.\n\nFor US airlines not listed on the dashboard, or in cases where the disruption is uncontrollable (like because of a winter storm), or if the compensation is unclear, simply ask.\n\nIt never hurts to request a meal or hotel during flight disruptions, and you might get lucky with a goodwill gesture from the carrier.\n\nSeveral major banks offer credit cards that come with travel insurance, like Chase's Sapphire Reserve or American Express' Platinum Card. Both offer trip protection, meaning customers who purchased their flight with that specific card can reap the benefits.\n\nFor example, in the case of a major storm system, it's likely many passengers will end up stranded in random cities across the US.\n\nHowever, banks with travel insurance included can reimburse cardholders for unexpected expenses outside their control, including hotel, meal, and transportation costs.\n\nTravel insurance does not apply in all circumstances, like short delays, so be sure to check your policy before making a claim — but it also doesn't hurt to make the claim anyway, even if the answer is no.\n\nDuring the holidays, it's easy to lose sight of your purpose — seeing friends and family or simply getting away from home for a few days.\n\nHowever, delays and cancellations are inevitable. Don't spend all day sitting around waiting — give yourself a cut-off time. Once that moment passes, consider alternative means of getting to your destination, such as driving or taking a bus or train (which may also be covered by travel insurance).\n\nIf you are stuck in another city and have no other option but to stay in a hotel or wait at the airport, decide how you want to spend your time and make a plan.\n\nEditor's note: This article was originally published in 2023 and has been updated.",

    "description": "Steven Carroll and his son spent weekends flying JetBlue for a challenge that once sent them from New York to DC to Florida and back all in one day.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Steve Carroll, a New York-based nurse practitioner who chased JetBlue's \"25 for 25\" challenge to earn 350,000 points and Mosaic status for 25 years by flying to 25 unique cities by December 31. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBreakfast in Massachusetts, lunch in DC, dinner in Orlando, and back home by midnight. That was one of the epic days that my 10-year-old son and I flew for JetBlue Airways' \"25 for 25\" challenge.\n\nIt was thrilling to plan and execute these trips, with layovers so tight we sometimes barely had time for a bathroom break. Finding a flourishing community chasing this challenge was one of the best parts.\n\nThe promotion, created for JetBlue's 25th anniversary, is simple: Fly to 25 unique cities in the airline's network between June 25 and December 31, and you'll earn Mosaic 1 status for 25 years plus a lump sum of 350,000 points.\n\nThere are some rules: You must connect your loyalty number to each flight; basic fares don't qualify; flights must be operated by JetBlue (not its partners, such as Cape Air); and only arrival airports count.\n\nStill, I realized it could be an unforgettable experience for my son Jackson and I. He already loves JetBlue (I think the TV screens do it for him), and his 100th and 200th flights ever were on JetBlue.\n\nPlus, Mosaic status until age 35 means he and his friends could enjoy the perks — like free bags, complimentary drinks, dedicated security and check-in, early boarding, and seat upgrades — on future spring break or summer trips in college. (Editor's note: You must be a Mosaic  3 member or higher to receive complimentary Mint upgrades and a Mosaic 4 for lounge access when JetBlue's open in late 2025.)\n\nThe math also checked out. Completing the challenge earned each of us a reward of 350,000 points, at least $3,500 in travel apiece, plus the additional points earned from our flights.\n\nCombining the cash I paid plus the 100,000 JetBlue points I already had, the whole challenge cost around $7,000, but I was essentially reimbursed in points.\n\nI started the challenge already holding Mosaic, but securing long-term status now gives me more freedom to put everyday spending on other cards and build points with brands like Hyatt via Chase.\n\nJetBlue's new partnership with United Airlines also means I can tap into reciprocal benefits on United — an attractive perk since we live close to the airline's Newark, New Jersey, base.\n\nTo maximize our time, we mostly flew on weekends and sometimes took up to five flights across a Saturday or Sunday. We took closer to 35 flights overall because of the overlap at some departure and connecting airports.\n\nOur flights stretched west to Los Angeles, north to Portland, Maine, and south to Fort Lauderdale. We've also checked off airports like Cleveland, Norfolk, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Manchester in New Hampshire, Raleigh in North Carolina, and Buffalo in New York.\n\nOur most ambitious weekend was over Veterans Day in November, when we planned 18 flights and 11 new cities. The government shutdown, however, canceled five of them, but we managed to rebook and still add several new destinations.\n\nAside from those cancellations and a huge delay that forced us to postpone a trip, the challenge has been remarkably smooth. And we've met a great community of people also clamoring for 25 years of Mosaic status.\n\nWe recently flew in Mint business class to Los Angeles as our 23rd city and completed the challenge on December 8 in Fort Myers, with about three weeks to spare.\n\nI already had a few JetBlue trips on my calendar to start, but then I created a master list of airports in the Northeast along with their city pairs. I live just north of New York City.\n\nThe goal was to create snaking routes that efficiently hopscotch across the US; we're trying to avoid international flying. I'd sit up in bed when I couldn't sleep and just map out my options.\n\nOver time, I've figured out a few tricks: book one-ways, sit near the front, and choose the first and last flights of the day. Most fares averaged about $100 per person.\n\nI have lounge access that made longer layovers easier, though I occasionally booked \"illegal\" itineraries with very tight connections. Connecting airports, regardless of the time spent there, count as unique destinations.\n\nBut before I risked it, I checked the historical arrival times. One trip I planned included a 12-minute layover at New York-JFK, but we still made it because our flight from Hyannis, Massachusetts, landed half an hour early, as expected.\n\nWeather-tracking helped, too. I adjusted my flight if I anticipated a disruption, which my status allows me to do for free. An unofficial tool called \"25for25.ai\" was also helpful; you can plug in your starting point and block destinations you've already hit.\n\nLiving in the New York area made the challenge far more doable. Airports, like White Plains, LaGuardia, Newark, New York-JFK, and Islip on Long Island, are all considered separate, unique cities.\n\nNew York-JFK and Newark are especially useful since they offer so many connections. There's also Hartford, Connecticut, and Philadelphia nearby. That's seven of the 25 we just drove to.\n\nSmaller airports like Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts require more creativity because they offer limited frequencies.\n\nOne of our biggest travel days began in White Plains, New York, where we flew to Nantucket and had breakfast in town. We then headed to DC for lunch at the airport, and finally to Orlando for dinner, also at the airport.\n\nMy partner joined us on that trip, making it a family day in the skies. We crossed paths with about 15 other challengers on our legs to DC.\n\nWhat was extremely helpful was the dedicated Mosaic Facebook group, where other participants in the challenge shared routes and road warrior stories. It's not hosted by JetBlue.\n\nThe challenge fostered a vibrant and supportive community. (Editor's note: JetBlue told Business Insider that over 500 people have completed the promotion so far.)\n\nMy son and I sometimes saw other challengers on our flights and ate lunch together in the airport between legs. We helped a family of four explore the town during our layover in Nantucket.\n\nWe exchanged numbers with almost every person we met so we can stay in touch. I didn't expect to find such a large and enthusiastic community, but it was one of the best parts of the challenge.\n\nI have a little tag on my bag that somebody made for me that says 'JetBlue 25 for 25.' When people saw it, they were like, 'Oh, you're doing the challenge.'\n\nIt was nice getting help along the way, and I appreciate being able to help others, too, as we cheered them on to finish by the holidays.",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants will travel to face the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 17 in a matchup widely viewed as a battle for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nBoth teams enter with nine-game losing streaks and identical 2-13 records, yet the Giants opened as slight road favorites earlier this week.\n\nWhile much of the conversation surrounds New York's draft position, rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart and the Giants remain focused on ending their skid.\n\nHere are three reasons for optimism heading into Sunday's game.\n\nNew York has rarely been favored in recent years, and it is difficult to argue against the Raiders being one of the Giants' most favorable matchups this season. Las Vegas ranks last in the league across numerous statistical categories, giving the Giants a strong opportunity to snap their losing streak and secure their third victory of the year.\n\nThe Raiders rank 32nd in scoring, averaging just 14.5 points per game. They have scored fewer than 10 points in five contests this season and have been shut out twice. The Giants' defense has faced significant challenges this year, to say the least, but this matchup presents one of its most advantageous opportunities.\n\nGeno Smith has been the most-sacked signal-caller in the NFL this season, going down 52 times across 14 games. New York's defensive front entered the year with high expectations, and while the pass rush has underperformed outside of Brian Burns, rookie Abdul Carter has emerged strongly in recent weeks. Carter and the Giants' front could be poised for a productive performance on Sunday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants vs. Raiders: 3 reasons for optimism in Week 17",

    "fullText": "The New York Mets have some work to do to replace star slugging first baseman Pete Alonso’s production after he signed a five-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nWith the offseason focus being run prevention, the team has opted to risk offense for better defense, hence why Alonso wasn’t even given an offer by New York. The Mets have brought in several players who are known for their defense and got rid of several players who aren’t known for their defensive prowess.\n\nImproving the defense and pitching staff is always good, but Mets brass might not understand just how much Alonso did for this offense. He averaged 42 home runs and 114 RBI and is extremely durable. He is the franchise leader in home runs with 264.\n\nInfielder Jorge Polanco was signed to a two-year, $40 million contract and the expectation is that he will split time between first base and designated hitter. Polanco is a fine player and a solid defender, however, he’s played one inning of one game at first base in his whole career.\n\nReports suggest that the Seattle Mariners were prepping Polanco for a move to first base but never made the switch because there was nobody to replace Polanco at second base. Third baseman Mark Vientos is the other player who is projected to see time at first base, but there is a premier Japanese slugger who is a versatile corner infield/outfielder that would be a perfect fit for the Mets.\n\nProlific home run hitter Kazuma Okamoto was posted to Major League Baseball free agency by the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) on Nov. 20 and has until Jan. 4, 2026 to sign with an MLB team. MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand named the Mets a potential fit to land the 29-year-old superstar.\n\n“A decorated slugger in Japan, Okamoto will be posted by the Yomiuri Giants this winter, making him available to big league clubs,” Feinsand wrote Tuesday. “Okamoto, who became a full-time player with the Giants in 2018, is a six-time NPB All-Star who has won three home run titles, though there will be questions about his ability to hit higher-velocity pitchers in the Majors. The 29-year-old has 248 career home runs in 1,074 games with Yomiuri, including six consecutive 30-homer campaigns between 2018-23. Okamoto has played more third base than first in Japan, though it’s unclear how Major League teams will view him at the hot corner.”\n\nOkamoto’s versatility would allow for the Mets to play him, Polanco and Vientos at the same time in different ways depending on matchups. If the rumored projected contract for Okamoto is accurate (four-year, $64 million), the Mets have plenty of funds to get a deal done if there is mutual interest.",

    "fullText": "Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. The Cleveland Cavaliers are in the Mecca for a matchup with the New York Knicks.\n\nThe Cavs and Knicks have a history of bad blood between them. Their meeting in the 2023 NBA Playoffs was a stepping stone for New York and a reality check for the Cavaliers. The Cavs have been carrying that loss with them ever since — and they are hungry for a chance to redeem themselves in a potential rematch.\n\nBoth Cleveland and New York entered the season as favorites to win the Eastern Conference. That might have changed recently as the Detroit Pistons wedge themselves into the mix and the Cavaliers struggle to get out of the gates. But make no mistake, these two rosters are still among the most talented in the East. This game could carry weight by the time the playoffs begin.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe Knicks had a slow start last season as growing pains muddied their process. But following a trip to the Western Conference Finals, a coaching change and some roster tweaks, they’ve gotten off to a much better start this season.\n\nNew York holds the 2nd-best record in the East. They have the 2nd best offense, 14th best defense and 5th best net rating this season according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nThis is a team that has found its identity and plays basketball like they trust each other. They can give as good a challenge as any.\n\nIt’s pretty simple. The Cavs have had a rough December full of low points. But after winning back-to-back games at the start of the week, they have a chance to really make things right with a statement win over their rival on Christmas Day.",

    "description": "With the 2025 Christmas break underway, the New York Islanders hold onto the third spot in the Metropolitan Division. In […]",
    "fullText": "With the 2025 Christmas break underway, the New York Islanders hold onto the third spot in the Metropolitan Division. In 37 games, their record is 20-13-4, good for 44 points. The 2-1 win against the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday leapfrogged the Islanders over the Washington Capitals, who sit at 43 points after their 7-3 loss to the New York Rangers. Islanders’ General Manager Mathieu Darche has his fingers all over the organization’s rise.\n\nIt’s a big improvement from where the Islanders were a year ago. On December 25, 2024, the Islanders sat five points out of the final wildcard spot. Sporting a 13-15-7 record through 35 games, the Islanders had just 33 points and were 13th in the Eastern Conference. With hindsight, it’s known the Islanders won the lottery and drafted phenom defenseman Matthew Schaefer with the number one overall pick. But at the time, plenty of uneasiness was in the air.\n\nOn April 17, 2025, fans were understandably anxious about the team’s future. The Islanders just finished the season with a 35-35-12 record, good for 82 points and 13th in the East. Five days prior, the Islanders were officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since the 2021-22 season. The Philadelphia Flyers handed the Islanders the final blow. Even if the official elimination was a foregone conclusion by that point, the feeling of the season officially ending after 82 games hurt.\n\nThe Islanders’ future looked bleak. Fans soured on longtime GM Lou Lamoriello, and the Islanders organization seemed to agree. Following seven seasons with the club, Lamoriello’s contract wasn’t renewed, and he was let go on April 22nd. The team was slow. The prospect cupboard wasn’t in the upper echelon of the league. There was a feeling that a new set of eyes was needed to steer the Islanders in the right direction.\n\nThirteen days later, on May 5, they won the number pick in the upcoming draft lottery. 18 days after that, on May 23rd, Mathieu Darche was chosen to be the franchise’s seventh general manager.\n\nDarche didn’t wait long to get started. At the 2025 NHL Entry Draft, Darche traded star defenseman Noah Dobson to the Montreal Canadiens for picks 16 and 17 and Emil Heimeman. Darche used those picks on Viktor Eklund and Kashawn Aitcheson, respectively. Both players are highly touted, and the organization hopes they’ll be making an impact sooner rather than later. Heineman, meanwhile, has been a perfect fit on Long Island this season.\n\nIn free agency, Darche signed Jonathan Drouin and KHL phenom Max Shabanov. Both players have fit in well in Patrick Roy’s new speed-first system. Shabanov specifically has been leaned on by Roy at times to generate offense.\n\nDarche signing David Rittich was an under-the-radar move that has proven to be worth its weight in gold. Rittich was originally supposed to be a temporary backup solution while Semyon Varlamov heals from his injury. He’s been excellent on Long Island through three months of the season. According to HockeyStats.com, Rittich boasts a +11.2 goals saved above expected in thirteen appearances, 15th best in the NHL. Rittich is sporting an 8-3-2 record with a .913 save percentage. His play has taken some of the workload off Ilya Sorokin, who has himself been excellent for the Islanders in a return to form.\n\nMathieu Darche’s first few months as Islanders GM are going well. The team is much faster than it was a year ago. They’re up eleven points on last year’s team. The Islanders can’t rest on their laurels with how tight the Eastern Conference is, but morale is high. If the Islanders keep their playoff spot past game 82, Darche should be in contention for one of the final GM of the Year spots. It’ll be difficult to beat out names such as Chris MacFarland, whose Colorado Avalanche are tearing through the NHL with a 27-2-7 record, but Darche should be given his flowers.\n\nIn twelve months, the New York Islanders have turned on a dime. From a team in murky waters to a speedy and winning roster that is buying in. He’ll get lost in the shuffle, but Mathieu Darche deserves praise for what he’s done on Long Island in the early goings of his GM tenure.\n\nHabs Daily: Merry Christmas, Hutson Surprises Community\n\nGreen Bay Packers Could Have a Hard Time Keeping Upcoming Free Agent\n\nRumor Points to Huge BOS Celtics Addition For NBA Finals Run",

    "description": "After an ugly performance in Week 16, New York Giants interim coach Mike Kafka expects a bounce-back game from QB Jaxson Dart against Las Vegas.",
    "fullText": "As the New York Giants prepare for their Christmas week matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders, interim head coach Mike Kafka expressed full confidence in rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart's ability to rebound from last week's disappointing performance.\n\n\"Really, Jaxson, the whole offensive unit, myself, we all are -- obviously, last week's performance wasn't to our standard,\" Kafka told reporters Wednesday. \"So, we came back to work today and yesterday dialed in on the game plan and emphasized the things that we need to get corrected.\n\n\"Today's a great day, a good work day in terms of getting out on the field, full speed, the timing, the rhythm, the communication, ramping that up as well... I'm expecting and anticipating a good work day today.\"\n\nKafka, drawing from his experience coaching Patrick Mahomes in Kansas City, emphasized the importance of the coach-quarterback relationship in navigating ups and downs.\n\n\"It's extremely important,\" he said. \"I've been in those situations, seeing the game through the helmet that way and being able to give them my experiences, not only as a player but also as a coach and having to go through those ebbs and flows of a season or a game or a quarter or a series or a play.\"\n\nWhen asked if he was curious about Dart's response to his first major struggle, Kafka was unequivocal.\n\n\"No, I wouldn't say I was curious. I knew exactly how he would respond, like he would respond to anything. The highs, the lows, he would respond the same way, with great attention to detail, urgency to get better,\" he said. \"Jaxson's had that approach, our whole offense has had that approach, and he's the leader of the ship.\"\n\nKafka also stressed consistent messaging.\n\n\"The messaging is consistent. The highs and the lows, they're all consistent. Where are the opportunities that we can learn from? Where are the opportunities we can grow from? And there's plenty of things that he did well in that game, too,\" he said. \"So, I think the consistency of that dialogue and really where the points of emphasis for that game, kind of turning the page, and now what can we do to apply those same learning tools to this game?\"\n\nAddressing speculation about Dart's freelance style being constrained, Kafka pushed back firmly.\n\n\"We want to give our players the ability to express themselves on the field to the best of their abilities and let their natural ability show,\" he said. \"You take those rules, and then you give it to the players, and then they elevate it, and they put their own stamp on it.\"\n\nHe added that he has heard no frustration from the rookie.\n\n\"No, no, we talk almost every day on a personal level, and then obviously on a football level,\" Kafka said. \"I'm right there arm-in-arm with him in terms of our operation.\"\n\nWith two games remaining in a challenging season, Kafka believes Dart and the offense are poised for a strong response.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants' Mike Kafka expects bounce-back game from Jaxson Dart",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Days after Ghislaine Maxwell asked a judge to immediately free her from a 20-year prison sentence, the public release of grand jury transcripts from her sex trafficking case returned the spotlight to victims whose allegations helped land her behind bars.\n\nThe disclosure of the transcripts as part of the Justice Department’s ongoing release of its investigative files on Maxwell and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein exposed how an FBI agent told grand jurors about Maxwell's critical role in Epstein’s decades-long sexual abuse of girls and young women.\n\nMaxwell, a British socialite and publishing heir, was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021 after four women told a federal jury in New York City about how she and Epstein abused them in the 1990s and early 2000s. Epstein never went to trial. He was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges and killed himself a month later in his cell at a Manhattan federal jail.\n\nTwo weeks ago, as the Justice Department prepared to begin releasing what are commonly known as the Epstein files, Maxwell filed a habeas petition, asking a federal judge to free her on grounds that “substantial new evidence” has emerged proving that constitutional violations spoiled her trial.\n\nMaxwell claimed exonerating information was withheld and that witnesses lied in their testimony. She filed the petition on her own, without the assistance of a lawyer.\n\nThis week, the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, scolded Maxwell for failing to remove victim names and other identifying information from her court papers. He said future filings must be kept sealed and out of public view until they have been reviewed and redacted to protect victims' identities.\n\nVictims fear Maxwell will be pardoned\n\nEpstein accuser Danielle Bensky said the release of records has only sharpened the focus on Maxwell’s crimes among their victims. Bensky said she's been involved in daily discussions with about two dozen other victims that make clear Maxwell “is a criminal who was 1,000% engaged in sexual acts.\"\n\n“I’ve heard things that would make your blood curdle. I just had a conversation with a survivor last night who said she was the puppeteer,” Bensky said.\n\nBensky said she was sexually abused by Epstein two decades ago. She said she was never personally abused by Maxwell.\n\nDelayed and heavily redacted files\n\nThe transcripts of grand jury proceedings that resulted in Maxwell's indictment were released this week in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law enacted last month after months of public and political pressure.\n\nThe Justice Department has been periodically posting records after acknowledging it would miss last Friday’s congressionally mandated deadline to release all records. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring victims’ names and other identifying information.\n\nOn Wednesday, the department said it may need a “few more weeks” to release the full trove after suddenly discovering more than a million potentially relevant documents. It was a stunning development after department officials suggested months ago that they'd already accounted for the vast universe of Epstein-related materials.\n\nSome of the Epstein and Maxwell grand jury records were initially released with heavy redactions — A 119-page document marked “Grand Jury-NY” — was entirely blacked out. Updated versions were posted over the weekend.\n\nFBI agent testifies Maxwell manipulated young girl\n\nAn FBI agent’s grand jury testimony, describing interviews conducted with Epstein victims, foreshadowed trial testimony a year later from four women who described Maxwell's role in their sexual abuse from 1994 to 2004.\n\nThe agent told of a woman who described meeting Maxwell and Epstein as a 14-year-old attending a Michigan summer arts camp in 1994. Flight logs showed Epstein and Maxwell went to the school sponsoring the camp because Epstein was a donor.\n\nAccording to the agent, whose name was redacted from the transcript, the girl had a chance encounter with Epstein and Maxwell one day. After learning that the girl was from Palm Beach, Florida, Epstein mentioned that he sometimes gave scholarships to students and they requested her phone number, the agent said.\n\nOnce home, the girl visited Epstein's estate with her mother for tea and the mother was impressed when Epstein said he provided scholarships, enough so that the mother said Epstein was like a “godfather,” the agent said.\n\nThe agent said the girl began regularly going to the estate as Epstein and Maxwell “groomed” her with gifts and trips to the movies, and Epstein began paying for voice lessons and giving her money that he said she should give to her struggling mother.\n\nThe agent said the girl thought her relationship with Epstein and Maxwell was strange, “but Maxwell normalized it for her. She was like a cool, older sister and made comments like, ‘This is what grownups do.’”\n\nEventually, the agent testified, the girl saw Maxwell topless at the pool. After she revealed that she hoped to be an actor and a model, Epstein told her he was best friends with the owner of Victoria's Secret and that she'll have to learn to be comfortable in her underwear and not be a prude, the agent said.\n\nThen, the agent said, the girl asked Epstein what he meant by that and the financier pulled her into his lap and masturbated. After that, the agent added, the girl's encounters with Epstein began to include sexual contact, particularly in his massage room.\n\nMaxwell was sometimes there with other girls, the agent said. One of the girls would begin massaging Epstein and Maxwell would tease the girls, the agent said.\n\n“She’d grab the girl’s breasts, and she would direct the girls on what to do,” the agent said, relaying the girl’s account. Maxwell's attitude during the encounters was ”very casual; she acted like this was normal,\" the agent said.\n\nThe released testimony appeared to reflect the testimony at Maxwell's 2021 trial by a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane.”\n\nAt trial, Jane said Maxwell also participated in group sessions between multiple females and Epstein that usually began with Epstein or Maxwell leading them all into a bedroom or a massage room at the Palm Beach residence.",

    "description": "A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.  U.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.\n\nThe Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing “illegal aliens over American citizens.”\n\n“As I said from the start, our laws protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe,” James said in a statement Friday. “I will always stand up for New Yorkers and the rule of law.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for the Justice Department.\n\nNardacci, appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, wrote that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the Green Light Law as a policy matter. Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration’s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.\n\nThe administration, she wrote, has “failed to state such a claim.”\n\nThe Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\n\nUnder the law, people who don’t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver’s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a “standard driver’s license.” It does not apply to commercial driver’s licenses.\n\nThe Justice Department’s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as “a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.” It highlighted a provision that requires the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.\n\nIn 2020, during Trump’s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\n\nThe governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.\n\nIn the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York’s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk’s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information “remains available to federal immigration authorities” through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",

    "description": "Scott Morrow’s time with the New York Rangers has been a rollercoaster ride this season, but there’s one aspect about his character that you can’t take away.",
    "fullText": "Scott Morrow’s time with the New York Rangers has been a rollercoaster ride this season, but there’s one aspect about his character that you can’t take away.\n\nWhen the Rangers acquired Morrow from the Carolina Hurricanes as part of the sign-and-trade deal involving K’Andre Miller, they were getting a player who was highly successful in the NCAA and American Hockey League level, largely due to his ability to create offense as a defenseman, but he had yet to etch his mark in the NHL.\n\nDespite failing to make the Rangers’ roster out of training camp, Morrow was called up a couple of times, and once Adam Fox landed on long-term injured reserve with an upper-body injury, Morrow got the opportunity to step into the lineup and play a prominent role.\n\nWhen asked about what he wanted to see from Morrow shortly after Fox’s injury, Sullivan gave a blunt answer, a sign that he was simply expecting more out of the young defenseman.\n\n“Assertive play,” Sullivan said about what he wants to see from Morrow. “Making decisions with conviction and not being in between. Eliminating hesitation from his game.”\n\nSince Sullivan’s request for Morrow to play with more assertiveness, he’s been in the lineup for nine games, which has come with its highs and lows.\n\nEven though the 23-year-old defenseman has specialized in the power play at practically every level of hockey, Sullivan decided to utilize a five-forward power-play unit upon Fox’s absence.\n\nAt first, Sullivan didn’t fully trust Morrow to quarterback the first power-play unit.\n\n“We don't think that's the strength of their games to this point,” Sullivan said of why Schneider or Morrow are not playing on the first power-play unit. “We're trying to put a power play together that we think gives us the best opportunity to have success. Obviously, Foxy, I think, is an elite power-play defenseman, with how he distributes the puck up there, the way he sees the game. He's got really good instincts. We don't necessarily think that that's the strength of some of the guys you just mentioned.”\n\nSullivan did emphasize that Morrow was the most equipped defenseman outside of Fox to play on the man advantage.\n\n“We’ve made a decision to go with five forwards at this point, but we know that if we were to use a defensemen, he would be the guy because of the instincts that he has,” Sullivan said.\n\nWith the five-forward unit failing to produce offense, Sullivan recently added Morrow to that first power-play unit.\n\nIn this role, Morrow has gone through a steep learning curve, committing some costly turnovers in the process, showing that there’s still room for him to grow.\n\nFrom an overall standpoint, Morrow has been prone to making some defensive mistakes. Specifically on Saturday afternoon in the Rangers’ game against the Philadelphia Flyers, Morrow committed two costly turnovers, the first one coming on the power play, which led to a shorthanded goal, and the next one taking place in overtime, nearly leading to the game-winning goal.\n\nThrough the mistakes, Morrow has continued to play an assertive game per request from Sullivan, earning his coach’s admiration.\n\n“What I'll say is, he's an incredible kid, and his ability to shrug off some of the plays and continue to perform out there, I think, speaks volumes for the character of what he's about,” Sullivan said. “He's a young player. He's going to make some mistakes, and let's be honest, we're putting him in some really high-profile positions, whether it be on the power play and overtime, things of that nature. He's playing a significant role here with this group right now, especially with Foxy being out, and so I think he's done a great job with just playing through the ups and the downs.\n\nRangers Put Scoring Barrage On Display En Route To Comeback Win Over Capitals In a season filled with scoring woes, the New York <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/new-york-rangers\">Rangers</a> flipped the switch on Tuesday night, scoring five goals in the third period against the Washington Capitals, en route to a 7-3 win.&nbsp;\n\n“I think that's what you get when you deal with young players, especially defensemen. I said this to you guys all the time, I think it's the hardest position to play, but I admire his resilience because that would affect a lot of young players the wrong way. When you watch Scotty play, if he makes a mistake, he shrugs it off, he learns from it. We couldn't be more proud of him for his ability to respond to those situations.”\n\nSullivan has continued to roll with Morrow on the first power-play unit and give him heavy minutes despite some of his defensive blunders, not trying to punish Morrow for mistakes as he continues to develop.\n\nOn Tuesday night in the Rangers’ 7-3 win over the Washington Capitals, Morrow played arguably his best game of the season.\n\nHe led all Rangers defenseman with a 2.50 Game Score, an analytical stat used to quantify a player's single-game impact, blending goals, assists, shots, penalties, faceoffs, and 5v5 goal/Corsi differentials (shot attempts) into one number, with higher scores indicating better overall performance in that specific game.\n\nMorrow clearly has the talent to transform into an impactful NHL defenseman. Now it’s about fully adapting to the speed of the NHL game and providing more of a reliable presence for the Rangers, something that should come with time.",

    "fullText": "After losing to the New York Knicks in the playoffs last year, the Boston Celtics know that New York isn’t going away anytime soon. The same can be said for any other hopeful contender in the Eastern Conference: to each of them, the Knicks are a legit barrier.\n\nAfter a rocky start to the season, which had New York’s decision to fire Tom Thibodeau not looking great, the Knicks have bounced back, stabilized, and begun to excel again. They already had a bunch of roster talent in place, of course, but new head coach Mike Brown has added some wrinkles that have improved the Knicks along the margins.\n\nOne of those wrinkles is the emergence of second-year point guard Tyler Kolek, who has received more opportunity from Brown than he did from Thibodeau.\n\nSure, part of this has to do with Kolek being a year older and more experienced, but another part of it is that Brown is more liberal with his rotation than Thibs, who famously plays the same six or seven players into the ground (and has found his own success with it, to his credit).\n\nKolek only appeared in 41 games last year, at a 7.2 minutes per game rate. The Marquette guard has already appeared in 25 games this season under Brown, averaging 12.7 minutes per game as Jalen Brunson’s full-time backup.\n\nOn Tuesday against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Brown gave Kolek his first career start, and Kolek did not disappoint in the slightest.\n\nThe 24-year-old lefty flirted with a triple-double, dropping 20 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists and three steals in a statement performance.\n\nTyler Kolek in his first NBA start:\n\n20 Points (41% FG)\n11 Rebounds\n8 Assists\n3 Steals pic.twitter.com/Qt1k6CWGFD\n\n— KnicksMuse (@KnicksMuse) December 24, 2025\n\nKolek’s growing confidence is a wonderful development for the Knicks, just as much as it’s a terrible development for the rest of the East. The Knicks have struggled in recent years to find a viable backup who can spell Brunson without presiding over a severe drop-off in quality. Kolek isn’t going to be Brunson out there, obviously, but he can more than hold his own running an offense, and he’s a threat to score, too. This means the Knicks just leveled up as a team when Brunson is resting.\n\nNew York was two wins away from the NBA Finals last season. If they can improve marginally, they can take a step further. Kolek represents a small improvement to the depth chart that might help New York take that step.\n\nHe might seem like an inconsequential element in the East arms race, but look closer, and you’ll realize the importance of Kolek’s rise.\n\nKnicks’ Jalen Brunson Responds To Foul Baiting Accusations",

    "description": "Manhattan's most popular tourist attractions during the holidays include Rockefeller Center, Macy's, and Bryant Park.",
    "fullText": "When you're a native New Yorker, one thing you learn is that while the holiday season in New York City is magical, you should avoid tourist attractions at all costs.\n\nThere are plenty of other things to do during the holidays — for every Rolf's, there's a less crowded, more fun bar like Paddy Maguire's Ale House.\n\nBut I wanted to see if it was all that bad, so in 2023, I visited some of the biggest holiday tourist attractions in the city.\n\nTourism has only grown since then. According to a report published in November by the city's Economic Development Corporation, 48,000 more visitors per weekend on average visited Times Square in December 2024 than in December 2023, and Fifth Avenue saw 27,000 more weekend visitors in the same timeframe. Seasonal tourism also brings $500 million in revenue to the city.\n\nFor my holiday tour of Manhattan, I started at Wollman Rink in Central Park, walked to the Plaza Hotel and the Pulitzer Fountain, strolled down Fifth Avenue to Saks Fifth Avenue, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and Rockefeller Center, continued west toward Bryant Park, and concluded my journey at Macy's Herald Square.\n\nWollman Rink, in the southern part of the park, is open from October through March. It's been a popular holiday destination for decades and has featured in numerous holiday movies, including \"Serendipity.\"\n\nI knew I was getting close to the rink, but even though I came to skate here in 2021, I had no recollection of seeing people peering down at me from a giant rock ledge.\n\nBut, lo and behold, when I climbed up to see what everyone was looking at, I was staring directly at the rink.\n\nYou can just make them out, but there are even more people across the ice at the other gate.\n\nWhen I skated at Wollman Rink, I found it was very disorganized compared to other rinks in the city, and I don't think I'll go back to skate.\n\nInstead, I decided on a hot drink.\n\nIt turns out that hot chocolate was just the thing to help me out.\n\nIn front of the door was a sign that said only guests of the hotel or patrons of the restaurant were allowed in the building.\n\nI watched as the hotel employee stopped anyone walking in to see what their business was and turned a few people away.\n\nA musician was singing \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\"\n\nFor a few years, the Pulitzer Fountain was transformed into an ice-skating rink with polar bears and penguins. They've since toned it down with some giant ornaments and lights.\n\nThis is the Peninsula Hotel, another New York City landmark.\n\nThere's also lots of legendary shopping on Fifth Avenue, from Bergdorf Goodman to Harry Winston to Cartier to Louis Vuitton and more.\n\nI shouldn't have been surprised by the crowds — New York City's visitor numbers have almost fully rebounded since pandemic lows.\n\nIn December 2025, 1010 Wins predicted 8 million people would visit New York City in the six weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's.\n\nYou have to be prepared for people to stop.\n\nSt. Patrick's Cathedral, the largest Gothic Catholic cathedral in the US, opened in 1879. More than 5 million people visit each year.\n\nEntry is free, which makes this a great activity for anyone on a budget. Plus, the church was decorated — there were wreaths and Christmas trees, and the main altar was covered in poinsettias.\n\nThe manger happened to be near an exit, meaning that stopping to take pictures here held up a significant amount of traffic.\n\nEvery way I turned, I watched people snap picture after picture.\n\nThe Saks Fifth Avenue I visited, which is actually on Fifth Avenue, is the department store's flagship. It opened in 1924 and has remained there for almost a century.\n\nThis year's display was called \"Your Story in Lights.\"\n\nThis year's light show is set to a \"curated medley of uplifting music.\" It runs every 10 minutes from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nThe store was selling ornaments and other holiday goodies back here, but I had to walk through the entire store just to get there.\n\nI haven't been back this year, but I've seen on social media that they've added some more decorations in front of the store.\n\nLego is a huge draw for parents looking to entertain their kids.\n\nIn 2025, the tree is a 75-foot Norwegian spruce from East Greenbush, New York.\n\nIt was all getting a bit claustrophobic for me.\n\nAlong the way, I saw Radio City Music Hall, home of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, but the street looked too crowded for me to even attempt getting closer.\n\nI'd recommend going to the Radio City Christmas Spectacular at least once. It's playing through January 2.\n\nBryant Park is home to one of the two largest holiday markets in Manhattan, the other being Union Square. I prefer Bryant Park since it's more open, has a better view, and is closer to where I live.\n\nThe last time I was there, it wasn't too crowded, but the same couldn't be said for this visit.\n\nIf you head to the Winter Village a few weeks before the holidays, it's a more enjoyable experience. But, as you inch closer to Christmas, it gets more crowded.\n\nThe lines were so long and densely packed that I decided I could wait.\n\nAccording to the 34th Street Partnership, the store has 1.25 million square feet of retail space across 12 floors and takes up an entire city block.\n\nMacy's moved to this location in 1902.\n\nI also felt guilty for getting in the way of other people's photos.\n\nWhen I returned an hour later, it was easier to sneak a peek.\n\nI just had to let the crowd take me where I needed to go.\n\nThey spare no expense decorating at Macy's.\n\nMacy's announced that Toys 'R' Us would be incorporated into its existing stores in 2021, ahead of the 2022 holiday season.\n\nToys 'R' Us returned for the 2025 season.\n\nThere were crowds of kids (not pictured) in the various aisles, at the play place, and inspecting the Funko Pops.\n\nThe toys were on the seventh floor, while Santa was up on the eighth floor.\n\nThere was a long line to meet Santa, even though you have to reserve a time to meet him.\n\nThis was the sixth floor, which was mostly dedicated to home and kitchen goods. I felt like I could finally breathe.\n\nNew York City is still my favorite place — and maybe everyone else's — to be during the holidays.",

    "fullText": "Since the NFL has three games scheduled for Christmas Day on Thursday and two on Saturday, the main slate on Sunday is quite bare -- just nine games are scheduled. The early 1:00 pm window gets the lion's share of those games (seven), leaving just two for the late window.\n\nThe two games in the late window could not be more opposed in importance.\n\nThe 4:05 game on CBS is a matchup between the league's two worst teams -- the New York Giants and the Las Vegas Raiders -- who both enter Week 17 with 2-13 records, scrambling for the right to secure the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nKevin Harlan getting Raiders-Giants means the number 1 pick is going to be decided by an incredible play at the end of the game that we will all remember for years https://t.co/Mf99zBppAX\n\n— Clem (@TheClemReport) December 23, 2025\n\nSome prognosticators are calling this game the Tank Bowl. Bottom line: The loser is the real winner in this one.\n\nThe second game, at 4:25 on FOX, features the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles traveling to Buffalo to take on the Bills and Josh Allen.\n\nNow, how many people do you think will be turning the channel at 4:25 from CBS to FOX? We're guessing a whole lot. These two teams could find themselves in the Super Bowl this February.\n\nThe Giants are on a nine-game losing streak and have lost 13 consecutive road games going back to last season. The Raiders are also on a nine-game skid. They are just 1-6 at home this year.\n\nNo matter where one turns on late Sunday afternoon, Tom Brady will have some influence and interest. He is a minority owner of the Raiders, and he will be serving as the booth analyst for the Bills-Eagles game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: The Tank Bowl: Will anyone watch New York Giants vs. Las Vegas Raiders?",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has accused The New York Times of being a national security threat in an unhinged Truth Social post.\n\n“The Failing New York Times, and their lies and purposeful misrepresentations, is a serious threat to the National Security of our Nation,” Trump wrote in a late-night social media meltdown.\n\n“Their Radical Left, Unhinged Behavior, writing FAKE Articles and Opinions in a never-ending way, must be dealt with and stopped. THEY ARE A TRUE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! Thank you for your attention to this matter. PRESIDENT DJT.”\n\nIt is unclear what prompted Trump’s latest attack on the newspaper he has long derided as part of the “fake news” media.\n\nHowever, the president and the White House were triggered for days over a November report in the Times revealing that the 79-year-old president has drastically reduced his public appearances compared to his first term.\n\nTrump, who is on track to become the oldest sitting U.S. president to date, is also starting his days later on average and working shorter hours than he did during his first stint in the White House, the Times reported.\n\nLast week, the paper also published a detailed report examining Trump’s friendship with the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, describing how the two “pursued women in a game of ego and dominance” in which “female bodies were currency.”\n\nIn one particularly damaging section, a mother who accompanied her 14-year-old daughter to a party at Mar-a-Lago with other young models claimed she was warned by Trump’s then-wife, Marla Maples: “Whatever you do, do not let her around any of these men, and especially my husband.” Maples denied making the remark to the Times.\n\nTrump also took aim at the Times during a Monday press conference, accusing the paper of insufficiently covering his plan to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nThe president ranted about the outlet while continuing to push a dubious claim that he had lowered the cost of prescription drugs by the mathematically impossible amount of up to “3,000 percent.”\n\n“A drug that sells for $10 in London is costing $130 in New York. We’re bringing it down to $20,” Trump said. “So we’re going down—you can do your own math, but it’s 2,000 percent, 3,000 percent. It’s pretty amazing. And, you know, the New York Times had a story about it, a small story, way in the back of the paper. It’s the single biggest thing to happen with respect to drugs probably in 50 years.\n\n“It’s the biggest thing ever to happen, and it’s barely covered in the New York Times because it’s a fake newspaper,” Trump added.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted The New York Times for comment.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Ringer updated its Top 100 NBA Player Rankings on Tuesday, and the New York Knicks were featured prominently in the new edition.\n\nThe Knicks had six players in the new rankings, the second most of any team, trailing only the Oklahoma City Thunder (8).\n\nGuard Jalen Brunson stayed at No. 9 overall. Brunson is seventh in the league in scoring, averaging 29.1 points per night. He's shooting 48.2% from the field, 37.4% from deep and 84.7% from the line.\n\n\"Brunson still spends more time with the ball in his hands than just about every player in the NBA, but as he adjusts to a new system that wants the sum to be greater than its individual parts, New York’s perennial MVP candidate is doing a very good job sharing the spotlight.\"\n\nNext for the Knicks was Karl-Anthony Towns, who moved up a spot to 20th. Below Towns was OG Anunoby at No. 40.\n\n\"Mike Brown has the Knicks jacking up 3s like never before—particularly Anunoby, who has found himself open enough, often enough to really let it fly.\"\n\nMikal Bridges ranked No. 52, a four-spot rise from the previous rankings. Bridges has had three-straight 20+ point games, including 24 points in a win over the Miami Heat on Sunday.\n\nThe Knick who made the biggest leap was Josh Hart, who jumped 14 spots to No. 78. Hart's averaging 12.2 points per game while shooting 50.4% from the field. Mitchell Robinson, who moved up three spots to No. 97, rounded out the list for New York.\n\nSteph's quote about Klay will bring a tear to Warriors fans\n\nJoe Mazzulla wants to get a pet wolf\n\nSteven Adams has the craziest eating habits in the NBA\n\nAnthony Edwards had an \"I'm him\" moment vs. Thunder\n\nWe finally know how Michael Jordan really feels about Scottie Pippen\n\nCooper Flagg's clutch stats are unprecedented",

Meanwhile, two of their biggest rivals, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets, are expected to be near the top of the draft order.\n\nBoth Miami and New York might be eyeing a rookie quarterback in the first round. Pro Football Focus’s Gordon McGuinness released a mock draft on Monday that had the Dolphins moving up from Pick No. 10 to No. 1 by trading with the New York Giants to secure Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza.\n\n“Projected trade: New York Giants send No. 1 overall pick to Miami Dolphins for No. 10, No. 44, a 2027 first-round pick and a 2027 second-round pick,” McGuinness wrote.\n\n“With Tua Tagovailoa benched ahead of the Dolphins’ Week 16 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, it’s obvious that Miami is in the market for a new quarterback. In this mock draft, they get aggressive to move up for one.\n\n“Mendoza recorded a 6.2% big-time throw rate and a 2.3% turnover-worthy play rate this season, which compares well with recent No. 1 overall picks Cam Ward (6.3%, 3.3%) and Caleb Williams (6.2%, 3.6%).”\n\nThe Dolphins will likely be on the lookout for a replacement for Tagovailoa. With the upcoming rookie quarterback draft class not expected to be deep, Miami will need to think outside the box to move up in the draft and find its future signal caller.\n\nWhy Bill Belichick’s Possible Latest Move Signals He Likely Won’t Accept NFL Head Coaching Role This Offseason",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets got blown out for the third straight game on Sunday. The New Orleans Saints came into the game with a 4 – 10 record and a struggling rookie quarterback at the helm. They looked to be on a similar level to the New York Jets. There was reason to believe the Jets had a legitimate shot at victory. For almost three quarters the Jets kept the game close, trailing 9 – 6 with less than two minutes remaining in the third quarter. Then the Saints scored 20 straight points to close out another blowout Jets loss.\n\nIf the Jets can’t even keep a game against a team like the Saints close, there is little reason to believe the team will be competitive against top teams like the Patriots and the Bills left on the team’s schedule. The Jets are a hapless, hopeless, lifeless team with a practice squad level quarterback and practice squad level starters at multiple positions right now. Another lost season is winding down.

    "title": "Up in smoke: Inside New York City's chaotic crackdown on unlicensed weed shops",
    "description": "America's largest city wanted to get rid of illegal weed shops. Then came the SWAT teams.",
    "fullText": "On May 28, 2024, Lenore Elfand, the owner of Empire Cannabis Club, an unlicensed dispensary in New York's Chelsea neighborhood, received a frantic call from an employee. NYPD officers and deputies from the city's Sheriff's Office were lined up at the door, poised to raid the shop. Elfand said in an affidavit that when her security guard insisted on filming, officers placed him in handcuffs, killed the security cameras, and stormed in.\n\nElfand arrived 15 minutes later to find news crews interviewing New York City Sheriff Anthony Miranda, who was monitoring the raid. Inside, officers gathered products they suspected to contain THC and carried them away, Elfand said in a deposition. Her security guard was detained without charges for 30 hours. When she was given paperwork to sign, she wrote, the invoice \"had no actual documentation of what they took.\" More troubling was an omission: more than $10,000 in cash that she said officers removed from her store and that she never got back. Her claims were part of a larger suit on behalf of several cannabis merchants, in which a judge found that the Sheriff's Office violated the shop owners' constitutional rights.\n\nWeed, now legal for medical use in 40 states and fully legal in 24, has become one of the most ascendant industries in America. Cannabis retail sales nationwide have tripled since 2019, to a projected $34 billion this year. Now Big Weed is poised to get even bigger. Last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to expedite reclassifying cannabis from a Schedule I drug (the same designation as heroin and LSD) to a less dangerous Schedule III drug (like ketamine or Tylenol with codeine). The order doesn't legalize marijuana, but paves the way for further research into its potential benefits and for tax breaks for cannabis companies.\n\nBut building a successful business in a newly legal industry can be chaotic. And one place especially tumultuous has been in America's largest city.\n\nAfter New York State legalized marijuana in 2021, the state-approved industry was slow to materialize. As demand surged, hundreds of opportunistic merchants opened shop without licenses. At one point, The New York Times reported, they outnumbered Starbucks locations. Many were cash-only — making them prime targets for robberies. Teens loitered outside them, passing around medicinal-strength doobies they had purchased without any hassle. And the smell was everywhere: parks, playgrounds, even the steps of the Met — all wafted with dank clouds of ganja.\n\nIn 2024, after a public outcry, Gov. Kathy Hochul granted Mayor Eric Adams the authority to launch Operation Padlock to Protect. It was a sprawling deployment of K-9 units, SWAT vehicles, and officers in tactical gear to raid illegal weed stores, confiscate inventory, strap the merchants with debilitating fines, and potentially shutter them for as long as a year. The mayor heralded the dragnet as a rousing success. By City Hall's estimate, $95 million worth of cannabis products from the unlicensed sellers were seized.\n\nFor Elfand and other operators of unlicensed shops throughout New York, Operation Padlock to Protect has been a nightmare, largely at the discretion of the sheriff. An ex-cop with a gleaming pate, a horseshoe mustache, and a love for TV cameras, Miranda has been the subject of a Department of Investigation probe, three pending federal lawsuits, and a raft of complaints by the union representing his deputies — dozens of whom have reportedly quit.\n\nThe mayor and his office have stood by Miranda and the operation. \"Over the last four years, Mayor Adams has prioritized building a safe, well-regulated cannabis industry,\" a City Hall spokesperson wrote in a statement to Business Insider in response to questions for this article. \"To date, the team has sealed more than 1,600 illegal shops, marking a major step toward protecting communities from dangerous, unregulated products and strengthening a responsible legal market. This progress would not have been possible without Sheriff Miranda's leadership and his commitment to a safer, more equitable, and business-positive city.\" Miranda himself didn't comment to Business Insider.\n\nMiranda and Adams are both ex-cops who agitated for racial justice in the NYPD through organizations they founded: the National Latino Officers Association and 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, respectively. Miranda's group endorsed Adams in 2021 and he made Miranda sheriff when he was elected.\n\nUnlicensed weed shops were already proliferating when Adams appointed Miranda to take over at the Sheriff's Office, which falls under the city's Department of Finance and enforces court orders, property seizures, and cigarette licensing and taxation.\n\nWhen then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo — who once called marijuana a \"gateway drug\" — legalized the plant in 2021, he let New Yorkers smoke it wherever they were allowed to smoke cigarettes, a far more permissive provision than California, Colorado, and Massachusetts, which require smokers to be on private property. As people were getting their first COVID vaccines and venturing back into public life, suddenly it was legal to take a bong rip on Fifth Avenue.\n\nCuomo also launched a framework for allowing the licensed sale of weed. Critics say the rollout was slow and prohibitive; the state, for example, set aside the first licenses for people who had cannabis convictions. By June 2023, just 15 licensed dispensaries had opened in the city. By comparison, Colorado had 200 in the first six months of legalization. As the city of 8 million yearned to burn, delis and bodegas began slinging THC products from behind the counter. Seemingly overnight, it became possible to buy a joint along with an egg sandwich in the morning. Soon, stores opened for the sole purpose of selling cannabis without a license. They were neon-lit and decorated with posters of stoned cartoon characters. They had names like Best Budz, Cannabis Culture, Flame Zone, Puff & Pass, Zaza City, Zaza Land, and Zaza Waza Smoke Shop.\n\nAnd with them came concerns: The inventory was unregulated and might not be safe, and the stores were magnets for crime. In 2022, there were 593 robberies of smoke shops, a fourfold increase from 2021.\n\nAs the greenrush overtook New York City, the Sheriff's Office scrambled to convince the public that it had control of the situation. After Miranda's office began inspections in September 2022, deputies reportedly found they were seizing more evidence than could fit in their six shipping containers. Their Queens headquarters had so much weed that employees reported breathing problems. The union, which said one deputy was coughing up blood, filed labor complaints.\n\nMiranda's employees also began to question whether they had legal authority to raid the merchants. Eleven deputies who raised concerns about the cannabis raids were suspended on allegations of stealing alcohol seized from bars raided during the pandemic. They were never criminally charged. Nine resigned, and two were found not guilty in an administrative trial.\n\nIn a federal lawsuit which is still in litigation, Deputy Sheriff Furney Canteen alleged that when he raised these concerns, the sheriff withheld his pay and transferred him to a punishing assignment. \"You're a soldier and your job is to follow orders,\" Miranda told him, according to the complaint. When Canteen responded that his job was to follow legal orders, the lawsuit alleges, the sheriff responded sarcastically, \"I'll check on that and get back to you.\"\n\nUntil 2024, the raids had little teeth. Even after deputies confiscated shops' inventory, the unlicensed operators who received fines often ignored them and went right back to selling weed.\n\nIn April 2024, Gov. Kathy Hochul gave Adams and Miranda an assist: The city would have the right to fine landlords renting to unlicensed weed stores, and the sheriff could padlock any business selling unlicensed cannabis. \"We waited far too long for this reckoning with all the illegal shops and your day has come,\" Hochul declared at a press conference.\n\nThree weeks later, Adams launched Operation Padlock to Protect with a fury. The Sheriff's Office conducted hundreds of raids — which via Hochul's initiative did not require warrants — in tandem with the NYPD. They opened safes and cash registers, and removed tens of thousands of dollars in cash from locations across the city. They filled giant garbage bags with weed, THC oils, and edibles. Ingrid Siminovic, spokesperson for the sheriff's union, claims that Miranda \"forced\" deputies to take safes.\n\nNadia Kahnauth, an attorney for more than 100 store owners who have been caught in Miranda's net, told Business Insider that a total of more than $1 million was seized from her clients. She says that as of December 2025, fewer than five of them had recovered their seized cash.\n\nAt a City Council hearing last year, the lawyer testified that \"in each and every location there is significant cash being removed from registers.\" She added, \"I have other stores where there's $25,000 being removed — absolutely no documentation … and no method to recover all this money.\"\n\nKahnauth said that at least 10 of her clients had received calls or visits from unidentified men who demanded donations to \"Latino organizations\" in exchange for protection from raids. One agreed to pay monthly and was raided and shut down after missing an installment, she said. The merchants, who are immigrants, would not speak on the record out of fear of retaliation, she said.\n\nAmong those caught in Miranda's dragnet was Tyler Lehmann. He was the president of the Breckenridge Cannabis Cafe in Williamsburg, which was licensed to sell hemp but not THC, when the Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) conducted a search in January 2024 and seized products its agents believed to contain cannabis, according to a lawsuit Lehman filed. The shop got an administrative hearing, and the violations were ultimately dismissed.\n\nEight months later, the Sheriff's Office showed up.\n\nA team of plain-clothed and uniformed officers in bulletproof vests barged in and searched behind the counter, security footage reviewed by Business Insider shows. Four officers found bottles of tinctures — a type of distillate that can contain THC, CBD, or a mixture of both — and poured them into a clear plastic cup. Once it was filled, an officer took the cup into the bathroom of the store and poured it down the toilet. After the raid, Lehmann received an Order to Cease Unlicensed Activity and a seizure notice that \"THC Drinks\" were removed from his store.\n\nA deputy from Miranda's Public Relations Bureau, Lt. Francesca Rosa claimed under oath in a state lawsuit against the Sheriff's Office last year that \"we are not required to test the product.\" She said that during the raids, the teams decided if a product was illegal based on a review of its packaging and labeling. She also testified that she could smell which products contained THC — a feat that is not humanly possible.\n\nLehman's attorney showed Rosa an order from a judge, who ruled after a hearing with the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH) that the Sheriff's Office \"failed to establish the store posed an imminent threat\" — allowing the store to reopen to sell non-cannabis products. But the Sheriff's Office still decided that the store did pose an imminent threat, and kept it padlocked.\n\nIn October 2024, a Queens judge ruled that Operation Padlock to Protect was unconstitutional, and found Miranda's enforcement to be \"capricious and arbitrary.\" City Hall appealed, and a decision from the state appeals court is pending. In a separate case, a federal judge ruled there was nothing unconstitutional about Miranda's discretionary padlockings. The New York Post reviewed hundreds of pages of files from OATH hearings and found Miranda kept padlocks on nearly 30% of stores greenlit by a judge to reopen.\n\nThe manpower needed to orchestrate the raids required a drastic reorganization of the Sheriff's Office. The office maxed out its overtime budget and billed the city millions more than it was allotted. Deputies were no longer able to fully attend to other responsibilities, according to a letter from New York City Comptroller Brad Lander to the City's Department of Finance.\n\nIn June 2024, the union filed another complaint against Miranda with the Office of Collective Bargaining and punctuated it with a demand: The sheriff needed to resign.\n\nIn September 2024, the City Council summoned Miranda to a hearing on marijuana legalization and Operation Padlock to Protect.\n\n\"In just a little over four months, the operation has conducted over 5,059 inspections,\" Miranda testified. \"The sheriff's joint compliance task force has sealed 1,078 locations, seized over $67 million in illicit products, and issued $104 million in civil penalties.\" Another statistic he dropped: Of the 1,124 padlock orders he issued, a judge threw out 208 of them, nearly 20%.\n\nDays later, Miranda was back in the headlines with local media reporting a city Department of Investigation probe into the sheriff, reportedly into the claims of improper cash seizures and the alleged protection-money racket.\n\nReporters asked Adams if he still had confidence in Miranda. \"He's doing the job that New York is asking him to do,\" the mayor said. \"This guy has closed down 1,100 smoke shops. Got $78 million of illegal cannabis off of our streets, not in the hands of our children and families. And so, why would I not have confidence?\" Hours later, Adams was hit with a federal indictment for alleged bribery — charges that would be dismissed after President Donald Trump took office.\n\nOn the same day of the indictment, the Department of Investigation was at the Sheriff's Office — to collect tens of thousands of dollars that had been mysteriously discovered there. In a statement about this visit, City Hall said Miranda learned of \"seemingly unvouchered cash held in safe boxes and self-reported the incident to his supervisors,\" who called in investigators. The provenance of the money has not been revealed.\n\nAs the days passed, pressure on Miranda continued to mount. That October 2, DOI asked Kahnauth for the names of clients whose cash was seized during the sweeps. Two city councilmembers fired off a letter asking Miranda to square his testimony that his office did not seize cash with \"subsequent public testimony and recent press coverage\" suggesting it had. They asked for a reply by October 18.\n\n\"To the best of my knowledge, the Sheriff's Office has not seized or vouchered any currency related to Operation Padlock to Protect; the NYPD is responsible for all seizures and vouchering of currency during the Operation,\" Miranda wrote in a letter on November 1. A spokesperson for DOI declined to comment. Its probe is ongoing.\n\nFollowing Zohran Mamdani's historic election as mayor, the sheriff's union took out a full-page ad in the New York Post featuring a picture of Miranda dressed as Woody from \"Toy Story.\"\n\n\"MAYOR-ELECT MAMDANI: YOUR NEW ADMINISTRATION NEEDS QUALIFIED LEADERS! SHADY SHERIFF ANTHONY MIRANDA IS NOT ONE OF THEM,\" it blares above a mock resume listing: \"No new contract negotiated with the union since 2022, 16 labor grievances, a hostile work environment, abuse of authority, tax liens and fines from the municipal government, lies to city council, retaliation against his employees, and civil rights violation lawsuits from approximately 40 smokes shops.\"\n\nIt's not clear whether the Mamdani transition team will keep Miranda on in his current role. In early December, the Sheriff sent a cryptic email that some deputies interpreted to mean his days might be numbered.\n\nWith the subject headline \"Protect Your Standards,\" Miranda implored his employees to \"address failures early and with clear direction\" and \"set firm boundaries so no one pulls you into improper conduct.\"\n\n\"One Final Thought,\" Miranda wrote. \"SILENCE AND TAKING NO ACTION IS ALSO A DECISION, AN ENABLING DECISION.\"\n\nTimmy Facciola reports on politics and striped bass at his Substack, The Judge Street Journal.",

    "fullText": "Coming off a stirring win the night before, the New York Rangers try to avoid a letdown when they visit the Nashville Predators on Sunday night at Bridgestone Arena.\n\nBut they must do so without captain J.T. Miller, who sustained an upper-body injury Saturday in their 5-4 shootout win over the Philadelphia Flyers. Miller appeared to hurt his shoulder in a collision with Philly’s Nick Seeler at 10:06 of the third period, and didn’t return. Coach Mike Sullivan confirmed that Miller didn’t make the trip to Nashville and remains back in New York being evaluated by team medical personnel.\n\nJ.T. Miller left for the locker room after this collision with Nick Seelerpic.twitter.com/SKsRSZ1IMN\n\n— Spittin' Chiclets (@spittinchiclets) December 20, 2025\n\nMiller’s injury takes some of the luster off the latest come-from-behind win for the Rangers (18-15-4). They escaped a 4-2 hole in the third period, spent most of the five-minute overtime on the penalty kill, and then earned the hugely important second point in the shootout. Artemi Panarin scored two goals and another in the shootout after he missed one game with an illness.\n\nThat rousing victory followed a 2-1 overtime win in St. Louis against the Blues on Thursday, when Miller scored the winner after Gabe Perreault tied the game in the second period with his first NHL goal. Perreault kept the good vibes going Saturday, assisting on Vincent Trocheck’s third-period goal that got New York within 4-3. Mika Zibanejad ultimately forced overtime when he scored a power-play goal in the final minutes of regulation.\n\nThe Rangers have points in 10 of their past 14 games (8-4-2), and they seek their third three-game winning streak of the season Sunday. They enter the contest in Music City leading the NHL with 13 road wins, and ranked second with 27 points on the road. New York won four of its past five road games, and this one marks the start of six straight away from Madison Square Garden, bridging the NHL holiday break this coming week.\n\nSo far this season, the Rangers are 0-5-1 in the second of back-to-back games. Perhaps there will be a benefit facing a Predators team that’s one of four with a League-low 32 points, and also played Saturday.\n\nLuke Evangelista, Steven Stamkos, and Cole Smith scored third-period goals to help the Predators defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs 5-3 in Nashville on Saturday. Since Nov. 26, the Predators won eight of 12 games (8-4-0), after starting the season with a miserable 6-12-4 mark.\n\nThe Rangers hope to sweep the season series with a win Sunday. They defeated the Predators 6-3 at MSG on Nov. 10 for their first home victory of the season.\n\nJonathan Quick is the Rangers starting goalie Sunday, and seeks his first win since Nov. 7. Of course, Quick missed two weeks with a lower-body injury, but he’s winless in his past four starts, as well.\n\nYou can’t place all the blame on the 39-year-old goalie, though. Quick allowed 10 goals in his past four starts, losing three times in regulation and once in overtime, due in large part to lack of goal support from his teammates. The Rangers were outscored 11-5 in Quick’s past four starts, also allowing one empty-netter.\n\nAmong goalies who’ve started at least eight games this season, Quick (3-4-1) leads the League with a 1.88 goals-against average and .932 save percentage. He’s 7-14-3 all-time against the Predators with a 2.70 GAA, .900 save percentage, and one shutout.\n\nPlaying their sixth game in nine days, including three decided in overtime, it’s fair to say the Rangers are in the midst of a serious grind right now. That’s why it behooves them to roll four lines against the Predators, especially without Miller in the lineup.\n\nThe fourth line is an afterthought for Sullivan these days, even with Matt Rempe back from injury and Brennan Othman called up from Hartford of the American Hockey League this week. A big reason for this is that the Rangers are too often chasing the game, falling behind on the scoreboard, necessitating more minutes for the top-nine forwards.\n\nSuch was the case Saturday, when New York’s fourth line played one shift in the third period. In fact, Othmann and Rempe each had just one shift in the final 31:12 of game time, following Othmann’s fight with Flyers heavyweight Nic Deslauriers late in the second period. Rempe logged 4:56 TOI; Othmann had 4:51 TOI.\n\nTons of respect for #NYR Brennan Othmann, I don't even know if he knew who hit him, but how could you not love a guy who stands up for himself? \n\nEspecially against a tough customer like Deslauriers.pic.twitter.com/2Jro6kgV1Z\n\n— Jonny Lazarus (@JLazzy23) December 20, 2025\n\nWith a tired and depleted lineup, Sullivan’s got to find a way to trust the fourth line with more ice time against a mediocre opponent Sunday. Playing with a lead certainly makes that more of an option.\n\nIt looked and felt like such a throwback moment, when Zibanejad tied the game Saturday with his patented one-timer from the left circles, drawing the Rangers even after escaping a pair of two-goal deficits. He’s now the fifth player in Rangers history to score 50 game-tying goals, joining Rod Gilbert, Adam Graves, Andy Bathgate, and Brian Leetch. Pretty nice company Mika keeps.\n\nMIKA ONE-TIMER 💥 pic.twitter.com/8dzxQ0jK0l\n\n— New York Rangers (@NYRangers) December 20, 2025\n\nThat power-play goal Saturday was his team-high seventh this season.

    "title": "The mayor of a New York City suburb says building apartments on parking lots near train and bus stations is a key to reining in rent",
    "description": "New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert talked with Business Insider about how her NYC suburb is building lots of new housing and keeping costs down.",
    "fullText": "In a year full of abundance discourse, New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert is living the abundance agenda.\n\nThe skyline of her Westchester County city, just 20 miles north of Manhattan, is barely recognizable from a decade ago. New apartment and condo towers have shot up, the city's population is booming, and rents and home prices haven't risen nearly as fast as in other cities in the region and across the US.\n\nThe city plans to fulfill its goal of adding 11,000 units in about 32 buildings in several years, growing the city's housing stock by 37%, according to the Wall Street Journal. The mayor told Business Insider the city is about two-thirds of the way to its goal.\n\nAnd the efforts are showing signs of success. Median rents in New Rochelle rose by just 7% between 2017 and 2023, according to a Pew analysis of Apartment List data. That's compared to a 31% median rent increase nationwide.\n\nOver the last decade, the city has supercharged housing construction by overhauling zoning laws, streamlining environmental review, and offering new tax breaks to developers. The city has focused on revitalizing its downtown by building homes on underutilized commercial and parking lots near rail and bus stations.\n\n\"We weren't tearing down homes. We weren't tearing down existing apartment buildings,\" Ramos-Herbert said in an interview this fall with Business Insider. \"We were just leveraging underutilized sites and catalyzing them through the development.\"\n\nThe new homes don't just impact New Rochelle's 85,000 residents. They have implications for the entire region, which is suffering from one of the most severe housing shortages in the country. New York City relies on its suburbs to house a big portion of its workers and absorb a steady stream of people leaving the five boroughs.\n\nWhile the Big Apple builds less housing per capita than most other major cities in the US, many of its suburbs have an even more dismal record. Between 2010 and 2021, the New York suburbs approved just 13 new homes for every 1,000 residents — about half the rate of the Big Apple.\n\nThere's been some opposition to all the new construction in New Rochelle among locals. There are concerns about traffic, lack of parking, and noise from construction sites. But her constituents also worry that the shiny towers are being filled with transplants, rather than New Rochelle locals in need of affordable housing.\n\nThe mayor said that gentrification concerns are overblown. She noted that 22% of the residents in the new housing are from New Rochelle, and 21% are from surrounding towns in Westchester County. That's compared to 33% who've come from New York City. The new units have given locals a smaller home to downsize to, or a way to shorten their commute by living within walking distance of an Amtrak and Metro-North rail station, she said.\n\n\"These are not strangers. These are our friends. These are your kids' friends,\" she said. \"These are your parents.\"\n\nThe city has been hailed as a model for communities that need to boost housing production amid severe affordability challenges. New Rochelle isn't alone in the region — Jersey City has also built housing at a rapid clip in recent years, becoming another model for YIMBYs to point to.\n\nRamos-Herbert's advice to other cities and communities: start by building transit-oriented development on underutilized commercial plots.\n\nShe also touted the critical income the new housing and residents bring in for the city through property taxes and sales tax, allowing it to invest in infrastructure and programs that benefit everyone. She pointed to the $100 million renovation of the city's train station and the transformation of a highway that divides a historically Black neighborhood into a linear park and local road.\n\n\"You can only tax so much,\" she said. \"We have to kind of create, ensure, proactive creation of alternative revenue streams to support us.\"",

    "description": "Kameron Buckner says that dating as a busy startup founder in NYC is difficult, but certain boundaries and rules help her balance work and romance.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kameron Buckner, a 32-year-old startup founder based in New York City. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs a startup founder in NYC, dating is a struggle. I've noticed that some men want a woman who's a little bit more accessible throughout the week, and I've accepted I'm just not going to be that person.\n\nI have a rule of thumb right now: I won't date another early-stage founder. We can't both be fighting for our lives.\n\nMy work is demanding, and I can't be the spontaneous girl that a lot of men are looking for — I need a partner who understands that my startup is sometimes going to be my priority.\n\nI have my moments where I can meet up for a last-minute coffee, but most of the time, I'm a schedule-oriented girl. I'm all about laying out expectations and making it clear that my capacity to prioritize my relationship will fluctuate.\n\nI was a practicing attorney in a law firm for a year before realizing it was not the life I wanted to live. In 2024, I created Social Docket, an AI-powered platform designed to provide modern legal infrastructure for the creator economy.\n\nWhen I moved to New York a couple of years ago, I tested out the dating apps, but the men I saw didn't take good pictures, and it's really hard for me to get a feel for someone I haven't met in person. I've realized I prefer meeting people through friends or at an event.\n\nI'm also fast at weeding people out if I don't see it working out, meaning I'm very decisive about who I date. I don't have time to go on 10 dates to figure out if I like someone.\n\nIf someone asks what my week looks like, I'll give them the next two weeks, so we can plan the date, time, and activity. It's similar to how I plan meetings: I want to get them on my calendar.\n\nSome men seem to like it because it shows I'm willing to make time for them, but for others, I'm just not for them, and that's OK.\n\nIt sounds like I'm hiring, but I'm looking for someone who takes initiative. I work extremely hard in my business, so I appreciate someone who tells me the time and place to meet or provides me with a list of places to choose from. Someone who makes it simple.\n\nIf I'm in a busy season with work, it's nice to have a partner who can break up the fog of entrepreneurship and kindly remind me that he'd like to have some quality time together. There are times that I'm so locked in, and I do have to wake up a little bit.\n\nAt the same time, there will be moments when my partner can't be my priority. They have to understand that, as a founder, I'm actively fundraising and need to be committed. It doesn't mean I don't care, but I need to take a step back from our quality time.\n\nI might say, \"Hey, I have 15 meetings this week. I'm not going to have that much time to see you, but I'm down to do a FaceTime before bed.\"\n\nFiguring out how to learn and adapt to each other is one of the fun parts of finding a partner.\n\nThere have been times when people have made comments about my career, and I view them as a reflection of how they feel, whether it's a result of intimidation or self-consciousness.\n\nI opened up to an ex about my goal to one day make a million dollars in my company, and his first response was to question me and tell me it was greedy. He knew my heart, and for that to be the first thing he said was a real eye-opener to his character.\n\nI pay close attention to what the men I date say in the beginning and how they react to my success, because if it's an issue at the start, it's probably going to be an issue at the end. I've learned there's nothing wrong with walking away from people, even if it's just for a \"small\" reason.\n\nI think a good partner should want to see you succeed, because what's mine is yours. In a healthy partnership, both parties benefit and improve each other.\n\nI know the right partner will appreciate my ambition and drive, and let me come home to be the soft, feminine version of myself. They'll love both parts of me. With a foundation of humor, friendship, and support, everything else will just fall into place.\n\nDo you have a story to share about dating as a tech founder? If so, please reach out to the reporter tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2025. Donate today\n\nGothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul has vetoed a bill that would have required two-person crews on every New York City subway train, including a conductor and a driver.\n\nHochul’s veto is a blow to the Transit Workers Union, which had championed the bill for decades, arguing that having two-person train crews is crucial for safety.\n\nIn her veto, Hochul wrote that trains can be operated safely by one driver, and cited the bill’s cost.\n\n“The bill would cost as much as $10 million annually, reducing service, and limiting the MTA’s ability to benefit from capital investments in modern rolling stock and signals,” she wrote.\n\nThe MTA’s contract with the Transit Workers Union already requires two-person crews on many trains, and the legislation, on its own, wouldn’t have changed that. But it would have required an additional worker on the trains that currently only have one operator, as well as on future lines. State lawmakers overwhelmingly passed the bill in June.\n\nThe union did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the veto. But in September, TWU President John Samuelsen told Gothamist that having two workers per train is not just “a necessity for safety” but also “wanted by the overwhelming majority of New York City working people.” On Thursday, Hochul announced that subway crime was at its lowest level in 16 years, with overall major crime on the transit system down 5.2% from last year and 14.4% from 2019.\n\nAfter the veto, Samuelsen told the New York Times that Hochul’s decision to veto the bill was “classist,” and suggested that Hochul might experience a backlash from transit workers during her re-election campaign next year.\n\nBudget watchdogs, however, praised Hochul’s move.\n\n“The governor did the exact right thing vetoing this bill,” said Andrew Rein, president of the Citizens Budget Commission.\n\nHe said having one worker per train is “the global norm used by virtually every other transit system around the world,” and provides equally good service while saving money. In a study of 400 subway and commuter rail lines in 36 cities, NYU's Marron Institute of Urban Management found that fewer than 6.25% used two-person crews.\n\n17 people suffered non-severe injuries in what NJ Transit called a \"minor derailment\"\n\nCritics of the \"100-foot\" rule said it was a giveaway to developers on the backs of utility customers.\n\nCritics of the \"100-foot\" rule said it was a giveaway to developers on the backs of utility customers.",

    "fullText": "Decision from state supreme court on deal once worth $56bn and now worth some $139bn overturns ruling that prompted angry Musk backlash\n\nElon Musk’s controversial $56bn pay package from Tesla was reinstated by the Delaware supreme court on Friday, two years after a lower court struck down the vast compensation deal as “unfathomable”.\n\nThe reinstated pay package could be worth as much as $139bn today, according to the New York Times. The decision comes less than two months after Tesla shareholders approved a new plan that could be worth $1tn to Musk, already the world’s richest person, in a decade’s time. Musk’s fortune currently stands at an estimated $600bn.\n\nRescinding the pay deal would be “inequitable”, and would leave Musk “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years”, the Delaware supreme court justices wrote, echoing arguments from Tesla board members earlier this year.\n\nAt the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, this November, shareholders had approved a stopgap measure for Musk, ensuring – regardless of how the Delaware supreme court ruled on this appeal – that he would get the $56bn his supporters say he is owed.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment or \n\nBoth of the compensation packages, as well as other pay plans approved by Tesla shareholders, require Musk to meet a number of lofty goals related to product development and increasing the company’s value to $8.5tn in order to cash out on those awards.\n\nThe case that first invalidated the original pay package was launched seven years ago when a Tesla stockholder, who held just nine shares at the time, filed a suit arguing that the plan was set up to overpay the world’s richest person. That first ruling voided the billions Musk was to receive, which left the Tesla co-founder less than pleased.\n\nNot only did Musk relocate Tesla to Texas from Delaware, where it was incorporated at the time the suit began, he also publicly lashed out against the state and specifically its court of chancery and chief judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.\n\n“She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history,” he wrote on X, his social media platform, in February 2024.\n\nTesla stockholders in 2024 were again asked to vote on the 2018 pay package. They approved it, and once again, McCormick struck it down, ruling that the “Superstar CEO”, as she called him, had undue influence in developing his own pay package and that stockholders weren’t fully informed ahead of the vote.\n\nMusk has voiced his displeasure ever since.\n\n“Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,” he posted online earlier this year.\n\nIn Friday’s opinion, the justices agreed with McCormick’s earlier findings that there was a breach of fiduciary duty in developing the original package and presenting it to shareholders. They ordered $1 be paid to the plaintiff in nominal damages.\n\nHowever, the five judges agreed that rescinding Musk’s full pay package wasn’t appropriate.\n\nWhile Musk has publicly called for other companies to follow his lead and leave Delaware – which has historically been home to more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies – experts have tracked only a few dozen companies that have actually done so. That includes big companies including Dropbox and Coinbase, while other tech companies like Meta have only threatened to leave.",

    "fullText": "MAGA women are fleeing D.C. in droves.\n\nNew York congresswoman and MAGA darling Elise Stefanik shocked the political world on Friday when she announced that she’s quitting politics. Less than 30 minutes earlier, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis had done the same thing.\n\nStefanik’s announcement is the more surprising of the two. The 41-year-old congresswoman was a rising star in MAGA circles and was seen as a lock to win June 2026’s GOP primary in New York’s gubernatorial race.\n\n“While spending precious time with my family this Christmas season, I have made the decision to suspend my campaign for Governor and will not seek re-election to Congress,” she wrote in a lengthy X post.\n\nStefanik indicated she was stepping out of politics to spend more time with her 4-year-old son, Sam.\n\n“While many know me as Congresswoman, my most important title is Mom,” she said. “I believe that being a parent is life’s greatest gift and greatest responsibility. I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness—particularly at his tender age.”\n\nStefanik has represented New York’s 21st district, which covers the state’s heavily Republican upstate area, since 2015.\n\nThough she initially was elected as a moderate Republican, she swung hard to the right during her time in Congress to become one of Trump’s most ardent supporters.\n\nShe was endorsed by Trump in 2021 to replace Liz Cheney as House Republican Conference Chair. She held the position until January 2025, when Trump nominated her to become the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. In March, Trump withdrew his nomination, saying that he needed her in the House of Representatives, where Republicans held a slim majority.\n\nIn November, Stefanik announced that she would run for governor of New York, bidding to unseat incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul. According to a December Siena poll, she held a huge lead over the other Republican in the race, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, but trailed Hochul by 19 points in a potential head-to-head.\n\nStefanik’s announcement comes three days after the release of that poll.\n\nTrump, 79, mourned the loss of one of his champions on Truth Social.\n\n“Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!” the president wrote.\n\nIn contrast, Lummis’ retirement is less surprising—and did not merit a Truth Social sendoff from the president.\n\nLummis, 71, said in her announcement post that she decided not to seek re-election because she felt she did not have “six more years” in her. She will have served one term in the Senate when her seat goes up for election in 2026. Before her time as Senator, she served from 2009 to 2017 in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nOnce a free speech absolutist, Lummis changed her tune after the death of Charlie Kirk and the subsequent yanking of Jimmy Kimmel off the air for his comment that MAGA was desperate to paint Kirk’s assassin, Tyler Robinson, as non-MAGA.\n\nLummis didn’t even have a half-hour in the spotlight before Stefanik upstaged her.\n\nStefanik and Lummis are the latest Republicans to drop out of Congress after the shocking resignation of longtime MAGA loyalist-turned-foe Marjorie Taylor Greene. In the weeks following Greene’s announcement, an anonymous senior GOP lawmaker warned that more surprising departures would follow.\n\n“More explosive early resignations are coming,” said the lawmaker in November. “It’s a tinder box. Morale has never been lower. Mike Johnson will be stripped of his gavel, and they will lose the majority before this term is out.”",

    "description": "Corrections Officer David Kingsley was found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Robert Brooks. He was sentenced to life in prison.",
    "fullText": "The wind howled outside the Oneida County courthouse as David Kingsley stood before Judge Robert Bauer and was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the beating death of Robert Brooks.\n\nBrooks, an incarcerated individual transferred to Marcy Corrections Facility on Dec. 9, 2024, was brutally beaten with his hands cuffed behind his back by corrections officers while in custody. He died as a result of his injuries the next day. An autopsy was conducted by the Onondaga County Medical Examiner's Office and, in February, Brooks' death was ruled a homicide.\n\nThree of the four corrections officers charged in the case who had not taken a plea deal with the special prosecutor have gone to trial: David Kingsley, Mathew Galliher, and Nicholas Kieffer.\n\nKingsley was found guilty of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter while Galliher and Kieffer were acquitted.\n\nRobert Brooks Jr., Brooks’ son, and Jared Ricks, Brooks’ brother, had a chance to deliver a victim impact statement directly to Kingsley.\n\nBrooks Jr. said he remembered watching his father being beaten and feeling like he was stuck in a horror movie.\n\nRicks said the number of lives affected by the death of his brother has been unthinkable and that the actions of the corrections officers at Marcy robbed Brooks of his life, liberty, and happiness.\n\n“I pray that the court imposes a sentence severe enough to tell correctional officers that they cannot treat incarcerated individuals like animals and I pray that this court imposes a sentence severe enough to tell incarcerated individuals that their lives matter,” Brooks Jr. said.\n\nOnondaga County Assistant District Attorney Jed Hudson said that Kingsley, from the very beginning, was there — carrying Brooks by his feet, wrenching Brooks up by the neck, and holding Brooks by the neck against the wall with Nicholas Anzalone.\n\n“With his entire 300-pound frame, he lifted a 140-pound restrained man off a table by his throat,” Hudson said. “And for no reason.”\n\nHudson requested the maximum sentence against Kingsley.\n\n“It was Mr. Kingsley’s right to go to trial, but Mr. Kingsley made Mr. Brooks’ family sit in a courtroom, surrounded by people they didn’t know, and watched Robert Brooks die,” Hudson said. “Kingsley alone, of every major player who inflicted horrible injuries on Robert Brooks, insisted on taking responsibility for what he did.”\n\nWhen asked if he had anything to say to the court, Kingsley apologized for his actions that day.\n\n“I’d like to express my sincerest condolences to the Brooks family for the tragic loss they’ve suffered,” Kingsley said. “I know nothing I say or do can change the outcome. All of the events that happened over the last three days of Robert Brooks’ life should have never happened. Every single incident was senseless.”\n\nKingsley was sentenced to an indeterminate time to life in state prison for second-degree murder and 25 years for first-degree manslaughter.\n\nInvestigation: Utica Police Department investigating fatal shooting\n\nRetirement: Oneida County Legislature Chairman retiring after 45 years\n\nFire: DOCCS investigating fire at Marcy Correctional\n\nAfter the sentencing, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said he felt Kingsley’s apology was sincere, but “...far too late.”\n\n“Every defendant reacts differently when they’re sentenced. Some stay silent. I think Mr. Kingsley reflected on the gravity of the situation and it may have been the first time it dawned on him. I don’t think he joined the New York State Department of Corrections to become an animal. But someone has to address the issue of what happened here and what changed him to have such utter and abject disregard for a fellow human being’s life.”\n\nFitzpatrick added that everyone involved who laid hands on Robert Brooks and physically beat him is now serving a substantial prison sentence.\n\nReflecting on that, Fitzpatrick admitted that when meeting with Brooks Jr. for the first time, Brooks Jr. didn’t expect anything other than resignation and probationary sentences.\n\n“This is the first case in my memory where a New York State corrections officer has been convicted and sentenced for killing an incarcerated individual,” Fitzpatrick added.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Observer-Dispatch: Oneida County corrections officer sentenced to life in prison",

    "fullText": "UTICA, N.Y. (AP) — A former New York state prison guard convicted of murder for his role in the brutal beating of an inmate that was captured on body-camera footage was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in prison.\n\nDavid Kingsley also received a 25-year sentence for a manslaughter conviction in the case. He is the only former guard convicted of murder in the death of Robert Brooks, who was pummeled by corrections officers on the night of Dec. 9, 2024, at Marcy Correctional Facility. Five other guards charged in the 43-year-old Black man’s death have pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\n\nVideo footage of Brooks in handcuffs being punched and stomped by guards triggered widespread shock and calls for reform in New York's prisons. Kingsley was sentenced hours before Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a deal with state lawmakers on prison reforms that include a requirement that cameras be installed in all facilities and that video footage related to deaths behind bars be promptly released to state investigators.\n\nSix guards were indicted by a grand jury for murder charges brought earlier this year by the special prosecutor, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, who also charged four others with lesser crimes. Three of the defendants charged with murder later pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter.\n\nProsecutors said Kingsley deserved the maximum sentence because he refused to take responsibility for his actions and made Brooks' family go through the trauma of a trial. Speaking in court before the sentence was imposed, Kingsley apologized to Brooks' relatives for his role in the “senseless” actions that led to his death.\n\nThe victim’s son, Robert Brooks Jr., said that he hopes the case will prevent similar incidents in the future. Brooks’ brother, Jared Ricks, added that while forgiveness is a long way off, justice being served is a step on that path.\n\nKingsley, 45, was one of three guards tried before a jury in October on charges of murder and first-degree manslaughter. He was the only one of the trio found guilty. Body-camera footage played at the trial showed him holding Brooks by the neck and lifting him as multiple guards surrounded the handcuffed man.\n\nA final defendant is scheduled to stand trial Jan. 12 on a second-degree manslaughter charge. Another guard was released from prison this month as he attempts to withdraw his guilty plea to second-degree manslaughter.\n\nFitzpatrick became the special prosecutor after state Attorney General Letitia James recused herself, citing her office’s representation of several officers in separate lawsuits. He also is prosecuting guards in the fatal beating of Messiah Nantwi on March 1 at a nearby prison, the Mid-State Correctional Facility. Ten guards were indicted in April, including two who are charged with murder, in Nantwi’s death.\n\nThe prisons are about 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of New York City.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Rep. Elise Stefanik announced Friday that she is suspending her campaign for New York governor and will not seek reelection to Congress, abruptly bowing out of what was expected to be a bruising Republican primary and ending a once-promising tenure in the House.\n\nStefanik, an ally of President Donald Trump, said in a statement that she was confident of her chances in the Republican primary for governor against Bruce Blakeman, a county official in New York City’s suburbs. But she said, “It is not an effective use of our time” to stay in the race, and that she instead wants to spend more time with her young son and family.\n\n“I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness — particularly at his tender age,” she said.\n\nStefanik was set to have a tough race against Blakeman, with both politicians counting themselves as allies of Trump and attempting to court his support. Though, the president had seemed keen on avoiding picking a side in the race, telling reporters recently: “He’s great, and she’s great. They’re both great people.”\n\nOn Friday, Trump, writing on his Truth Social media platform, called Stefanik a “fantastic person and congresswoman.”\n\n“Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!” Trump wrote.\n\nStefanik, who represents a conservative congressional district in northern New York, has been an intense critic of incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is also seeking reelection but faces a primary challenge from her own lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.\n\nFollowing Stefanik's exit, Hochul's campaign spokesperson said, “If you run against Governor Kathy Hochul, you are going to lose.\"\n\nStefanik was the youngest woman ever elected to Congress when she won her first campaign in 2014 at just 30 years old, representing a new generation of Republicans making inroads in Washington. She ultimately rose to her party’s leadership in the House when she became the chair of the House Republican Conference in 2021.\n\nFirst viewed as a moderate when she came to Washington, Stefanik became far more conservative as Trump began to dominate the party. Once someone who refused to say Trump’s name, she became one of his top defenders during his first impeachment inquiry. She would go on to vote against certifying the 2020 election results, even after a violent mob stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nLast year, Stefanik was tapped to become the president’s ambassador to the United Nations, though her nomination was later pulled over concerns about her party’s narrow margins in the House. She then began to angle toward a run for governor.\n\nStefanik’s decision follows a clash with Speaker Mike Johnson, whom she accused of lying before embarking on a series of media interviews criticizing him. In one with The Wall Street Journal, she called Johnson a “political novice” and said he wouldn’t be reelected speaker if the vote were held today.\n\nThe tumultuous early December episode appeared to cool when Johnson said he and Stefanik had a “great talk.”\n\n“I called her and I said, ‘Why wouldn’t you just come to me, you know?’” Johnson said. “So we had some intense fellowship about that.”\n\nStill, Stefanik, the chairwoman of the House Republican leadership, has not fully walked back her criticisms. A Dec. 2 social media post remains online in which, after a provision she championed was omitted from a defense authorization bill, Stefanik accused Johnson of falsely claiming he was unaware of it, calling it “more lies from the Speaker.”\n\nBlakeman, the executive of Nassau County on Long Island, released a statement Friday night that thanked Stefanik “for her outstanding service to the people of New York and to all Americans.”\n\n“I am ready to work hand-in-hand with the Congresswoman and all New Yorkers to restore accountability, affordability, and safety to state government,” he said.",

Hooker is in just his third season in the NFL, but he will turn 28 years old in less than four weeks. Hooker has thrown nine passes in the NFL.

Rather, this appears to be a case of the Jets signing an emergency backup with whom they have some familiarity from Hooker’s time with the Detroit Lions.

    "description": "It wasn’t pretty, but the New York Rangers came away with a 2-1 win over the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night.",
    "fullText": "It wasn’t pretty, but the New York Rangers came away with a 2-1 win over the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night.\n\nGoing into this matchup, the Rangers had lost two consecutive games while only scoring one goal in the process.\n\nMike Sullivan’s response was to call up Gabe Perreault and Brennan Othmann from the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League, who both slotted into the lineup.\n\nDespite a strong first period where the Rangers led 10-5 in shots and dominated possession time for the most part, an offensive zone turnover led to a goal from Jonatan Berggren, putting the Blueshirts in an early 1-0 hole.\n\nThe Rangers came out aggressive in the second period, and on the power play, Will Cuylle took a shot that deflected off of Perreault’s foot for his first career NHL goal.\n\n“I kind of blacked out,” Perreault said about his goal. “Pretty lucky one, but feels good to get the first one.”\n\nAfter 40 minutes, the Rangers held a 25-15 edge in shots and felt they were outplaying the Blues.\n\n“I thought for the first two periods, we did a really good job,” Sullivan said. “I thought we were playing on top of them. We established a lot of offensive zone time.”\n\nThe Rangers’ game began to falter in the third period.\n\nSt. Louis began dictating the pace of play, creating multiple high-quality scoring chances, which put the Rangers on their heels for the majority of the final frame.\n\nIt was the heroics of Igor Shesterkin that helped the Rangers escape into overtime. Shesterkin made 11 critical saves down the stretch, and when the Blueshirts broke down defensively, their superstar goalie was there to bail them out.\n\n“It’s great,” J.T. Miller said of having Igor Shesterkin in net. “We talk about it all the time, it’s such a luxury to have. Even when it’s Quick in there, we are so lucky to have those guys, and obviously total confidence in them. It was on display again tonight.”\n\nShesterkin made 26 saves on the night, and his performance left Blues head coach Jim Montgomery nothing but impressed.\n\n\"Shesterkin's an elite goaltender in this league,” Montgomery said. “He showed that tonight.”\n\nIn overtime, Miller buried the game-winning goal to propel the Rangers to a hard-fought victory.\n\nMiller has recorded three overtime goals this season, joining Tomas Sandstrom, Adam Graves, and Marian Gaborik as the only Rangers players to accomplish this feat.\n\n“It's good for the confidence,” Miller said of his three overtime goals. “Last couple weeks, I feel like my games there. I don't think it's kind of back to the same as the beginning of the year. It's like not getting as much as I'd like, I think, on the scoresheet. But I got to believe that if you just play like that most games than not over the course of the season, good things will happen. Just try to be confident.”\n\nAdam Fox Returns To Practice For The First Time Since Suffering Injury It appears as if Adam Fox is making strides in his recovery from an upper-body injury.&nbsp;\n\nWhile this performance certainly wasn’t anything to write home about, Sullivan was pleased with the way his team played, specifically from the standpoint of playing with the right intentions in the offensive zone.\n\n“I thought our intentions as far as getting to the net front, getting inside a little bit more was better tonight,” Sullivan emphasized. “I thought we had more looks just by getting inside and trying to create off the shot. I do think the guys are listening in that regard, just trying to create more off the shot.”\n\nThe Rangers will be back in action on Saturday afternoon against the Philadelphia Flyers.",

    "description": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game.",
    "fullText": "Joe Buck will be part of ESPN’s first game lineup to call the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Mets game on April 15, as he announced on SI Media with Jimmy Traina. This marks Buck’s second consecutive year being part of ESPN’s first broadcast.\n\nDespite ESPN and Major League Baseball reaching a deal to air 30 regular-season games, Buck is only scheduled to call the Dodgers-Mets game. Last season marked the first time Buck called a nationally broadcasted baseball game since 2021, after leaving Fox for ESPN.\n\nIn 2022, Buck and Troy Aikman signed a multiyear deal with ESPN to become the voices of Monday Night Football. Despite shifting his focus mostly to the NFL, Buck returned for an MLB game alongside Chip Caray in the St. Louis Cardinals' booth in 2024.\n\nBuck and Caray also have fathers who were sports broadcasters. Joe Buck worked alongside his father, Jack, as a Cardinals radio and television broadcaster from 1991 to 2007.\n\nHe also called the PGA Tournament and hosted an alternate broadcast in 2022. The 56-year-old broadcaster prefers calling baseball games earlier in the season because he feels more prepared.\n\n“For someone who hasn’t been involved in the game for four years, and I did Opening Day last year, I think it’s easier to launch off the beginning of the season because it’s not looking back,” Buck told Traina.\n\nBuck also believes calling a game featuring the back-to-back World Series champions will make his job easier.\n\n“It’s a Dodger game, I think it’s Dodger-Mets so, there’s a lot to talk about. I mean, I could probably do it right now. The Dodgers, half their lineup’s going to end up in the Hall of Fame. They’re easy names.”\n\nWhile Buck didn’t officially rule out calling a game later in the season or during the playoffs, he acknowledged it would be much more challenging.\n\n“I’m not prepared to do that without putting myself in solitary confinement for a month and trying to catch up with everything that’s gone on,” Buck said.\n\nBefore Buck’s four-year absence from baseball, he was one of the most recognizable voices in the sport. He served as Fox’s lead play-by-play announcer from 1996 to 2021. During that time, Buck called 23 World Series and 21 All-Star Games, the most by any play-by-play announcer on network television.\n\nBuck will receive the 2026 Ford C. Frick Award, which is presented annually to a broadcaster for major contributions to baseball. Buck and his father will become the first father-son duo to receive the award.",

    "description": "I rode in business class on the Amtrak NextGen Acela train from NYC to Washington, DC, for $180. It was a great experience, but not worth the price.",
    "fullText": "The Amtrak Acela is an express service between Boston and Washington, DC. The train line introduced a new fleet on the route in August 2025, known as NextGen Acela.\n\nIn addition to being the fastest Amtrak train with a top speed of 160 miles per hour, the NextGen Acela has modern interiors and high-tech amenities.\n\nThe Amtrak Acela trains only have two classes — business and first. I booked my business-class ticket for $180.\n\nOut of curiosity, I looked at the pricing for coach seating on the regional Amtrak train, which is 30 minutes slower than the Acela. It was $40.\n\nMy train was scheduled to leave at 10 a.m., but there was a 90-minute delay. Since I was stuck at the station for longer than anticipated, I briefly considered going to the Metropolitan Lounge, an elevated space overlooking the train hall with cozy seating and complimentary refreshments.\n\nFirst-class passengers and those traveling in sleeper accommodations can get into the lounge for free, but other Amtrak riders have to pay $50 to access it.\n\nSince I'd already splurged on the business-class ticket, I decided to skip the lounge and head to the standard waiting room instead, but it was full. I finally settled for a seat on the floor against the wall until it was time to board.\n\nWhen I got in line to board, I was reminded that business class is just a standard ticket on the Amtrak Acela. Unlike business-class rides I've taken that also had coach seating, this trip didn't include the perk of priority boarding.\n\nSoft, cushy, spacious, supportive — these are the words that popped into my head when I settled into my business-class seat. A reclining function and footrest made the ride even more comfortable.\n\nPower outlets, USB ports, and a reading light were all conveniently located on the side of the seat. In front of me was a tray table and a fold-out cupholder.\n\nMost Amtrak trains I've been on have had WiFi, but in my experience, the connection has typically been too weak for much more than a Google search.\n\nI was stoked when the NextGen Acela's 5G WiFi was fast enough to stream YouTube videos without any issues. I passed the time by watching live sessions of my favorite bands.\n\nI've learned to set the bar low for train bathrooms. Stocked toilet paper, soap, and paper towels are not a given. Cleanliness and extra space aren't either. In my experience, some business-class bathrooms are no different from those in coach.\n\nSo I was ecstatic when I stepped inside the lavatory on the NextGen Acela. The automatic door opened into a spotless space that felt big enough for two people to do jumping jacks simultaneously.\n\nI found it aesthetically pleasing too, with bold red accents and trendy touches, from the shelf to the mirror.\n\nI also appreciated the touchless water, soap, and dryer functions on the sink.\n\n\"Amtrak travelers always have their preference,\" an Amtrak representative wrote in an email to Business Insider. \"If they want to experience these premium trains with enhanced amenities, they can. Or, if they prefer convenient and affordable downtown-to-downtown service up and down the Northeast Corridor, Northeast Regional trains offer a comfortable and enjoyable way to travel throughout the Northeast Corridor and points beyond.\"\n\nThe next time I take an Amtrak train, I'll miss the cozy seat, elevated bathroom, high-speed WiFi, and shorter travel time. Still, these perks weren't enough for me to consider Acela's business class to be worth more than quadruple the price of a coach ticket.",

    "fullText": "Study author says tech companies are reaping benefits of artificial intelligence age but society is left to pay cost\n\nThe AI boom has caused as much carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere in 2025 as emitted by the whole of New York City, it has been claimed.\n\nThe global environmental impact of the rapidly spreading technology has been estimated in research published on Wednesday which also found that AI-related water use now exceeds the entirety of global bottled-water demand.\n\nThe figures have been compiled by the Dutch academic Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of Digiconomist, a company that researches the unintended consequences of digital trends. He claimed they are the first attempt to measure the specific effect of artificial intelligence rather than datacentres in general as the use of chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini soared in 2025.\n\nThe figures show the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from AI use are also now equivalent to more than 8% of global aviation emissions. His study used technology companies’ own reporting and he called for stricter requirements for them to be more transparent about their climate impact.\n\n“The environmental cost of this is pretty huge in absolute terms,” he said. “At the moment society is paying for these costs, not the tech companies. The question is: is that fair? If they are reaping the benefits of this technology, why should they not be paying some of the costs?”\n\nDe Vries-Gao found that the 2025 carbon footprint of AI systems could be as high as 80m tonnes, while the water used could reach 765bn litres. He said it was the first time AI’s water impact had been estimated and showed that AI water use alone was more than a third higher than previous estimates of all datacentre water use.\n\nThe figures are published in the academic journal Patterns. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said earlier this year that AI-focused datacentres draw as much electricity as power-thirsty aluminium smelters and datacentre electricity consumption is expected to more than double by 2030.\n\n“This is yet more evidence that the public is footing the environmental bill for some of the richest companies on Earth,” said Donald Campbell, the director of advocacy at Foxglove, a UK non-profit that campaigns for fairness in tech. “Worse, it is likely just the tip of the iceberg. The datacentre construction frenzy, driven by generative AI, is only getting started.\n\n“Just one of these new ‘hyperscale’ facilities can generate climate emissions equivalent to several international airports. And in the UK alone, there are an estimated 100-200 of them in the planning system,” said Campbell.\n\nThe IEA has reported that the largest AI-focused datacentres being built today will each consume as much electricity as 2m households with the US accounting for the largest share of datacentre electricity consumption (45%) followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%).\n\nThe largest datacentre being planned in the UK, at a former coal power station site in Blyth, Northumberland, is expected to emit more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 a year when at full operation – the equivalent to the amount produced by more than 24,000 homes.\n\nIn India, where $30bn (£22.5bn) is being invested in datacentres, there are growing concerns that a lack of reliability from the National Grid will mean the construction of huge diesel generator farms for backup power, which the consultancy KPMG this week called “a massive … carbon liability”.\n\nTechnology companies’ environmental disclosures are often insufficient to assess even the total datacentre impact, never mind isolating AI use, said De Vries-Gao. He noted that when Google recently reported on the impact of its Gemini AI, it did not account for the water used in generating the electricity needed to power it.\n\nGoogle reported that in 2024 it managed to reduce energy emissions from its datacentres by 12% due to new clean energy sources, but it said this summer that achieving its climate goals was “now more complex and challenging across every level – from local to global” and “a key challenge is the slower-than-needed deployment of carbon-free energy technologies at scale”.\n\nGoogle was approached for comment.",

    "title": "The Phone Ban Saved High School",
    "description": "Since the bell-to-bell device lockup, teens in New York have rediscovered the simple pleasures of conversation, board games, and poker.",
    "fullText": "When New York State banned phones in public schools from bell to bell this past September, the goal — according to the ban’s champion, Governor Hochul — was undistracted learning. But within weeks of the Great Phone Lockup, teachers began to notice an incidental (and arguably even more compelling) benefit: The teens were talking to one another as if they were in a Brat Pack movie. Sure, there’s been grumbling and some burner phones and scrolling in the bathroom. At one high school, an entrepreneurial senior even bought a pouch-unlocking magnet on Amazon and tried to charge classmates a dollar per jailbreak. But generally, with phones off-limits, the atmosphere feels different. There’s a pleasant buzz in the lunchroom, chatter in the hallways, and an alphabet of new analog hobbies popping up just about everywhere. “We’ve had a lot more school spirit,” says Rosalmi, a senior at New Heights Academy Charter School in Harlem. “People are more willing to do stuff.”\n\nWhat stuff are they doing? At many schools, teachers have made cards, board games, and sports equipment available during free time, and the kids have deigned to use them. Kevin Casado, a coach and teacher at Math, Engineering, and Science Academy Charter High School in Bushwick, hands out volleyballs every lunch period. He says a lot more kids are playing this year than were last year. “It’s no net, open space, forming their own circles of ten or 12 kids, hitting it up to each other, an equal number of girls and boys,” he adds. Aidan Amin, a ninth-grader at Hunter College High School, is in a friend group that congregates in the school foyer to stack OK Play tiles and compete at Sorry! and other tabletop games during lunch. “I’d say it’s made us closer. Honestly, half the people I’m playing board games with I didn’t know at all before this,” Aidan says.\n\nAt Rosalmi’s school, dominoes rule the cafeteria. “Dominoes is really a staple Dominican game. People get passionate. You have to slam that first piece down on the table!” she says, adding that there’s trash talk “but it’s game trash talk. It’s really funny.” About 11 miles south, at Brooklyn Technical High School, the name of the game is poker, the trash talk is (sometimes) in Russian, and instead of chips or cash, the kids bet with hair ties. Josh (not his real name), a junior there, says about half a dozen games go on during free periods. He tends to play Texas Hold’em with a group of friends he made this year. Their antics draw spectators and even side wagers: “We have one player who is probably the least skilled, but a lot of people bet on him because he has absurd luck,” he says. “He pulled our group’s first-of-the-year full house with pocket aces. He’s very entertaining.”\n\nOther students have discovered vintage technology like Game Boys and mp3 players. Alexei Kotov is a sophomore at Aviation High School in Queens. He bought a CD Walkman on Amazon last year, and since the phone ban started, he has been packing his dad’s old CDs — the Doors, Weezer — in his backpack. “My favorite one’s probably No Doubt’s Tragic Kingdom,” Alexei says. “I like the vocals. It’s, like, really emotional.” He shares his earbuds at lunch and swaps recommendations with friends. “One of them is really into Queen,” he says.\n\nNoshin Sayira is a junior at Stuyvesant High School, meaning she’s in the middle of the highest-pressure year at what may be one of the highest-pressure high schools in the country. She tells me that students’ top objection to the phone policy is that it’s become cumbersome to do homework between classes or to quickly study in the hallway before a test. But Noshin recently started printing out her study guides and has found that reviewing on paper actually works better: “I don’t get distracted by notifications,” she says. She and her friends have developed a stress-relieving free-period ritual: They sketch one another’s outfits. “One of my friends usually has supplies like colored pencils and proper paper,” she says.\n\nTokyo Levy, a seventh-grader at I.S. 318 in Williamsburg, is a discernibly different kid than he was in his phone-carrying days, at least according to his mother, Krystyna Printup, an art teacher at the Brooklyn School for Social Justice in Bushwick. “He was forced into the rapid learning and usage of technology during COVID when he had to attend school from home via Zoom,” she says. That led to a fixation on video and computer games — Minecraft, Clash Royale — then social media. “Now, his phone is no longer clutched by his side to run to after dinner or before bed. There have even been a couple days where he’s left his phone accidentally at home.” At school, after noticing kids gathered around chess boards during lunch, he decided to “I’ve always thought of people who played chess as really intelligent people. I see other people play, and it has really motivated me to try it out for myself,” he says. Participating in soccer in the schoolyard at recess inspired him to join a soccer league in his neighborhood, too.\n\nLately, he’s been bugging his parents not for a new video game or an upgraded phone but for a mainstay of their own childhoods: a bicycle. He wants to hang out with the new friends he’s made at school on the weekends.",

    "fullText": "The Patriots suffered a defeat against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, but their chances of securing the AFC East title remain promising.\n\nNew England still has three regular season games remaining, playing the Baltimore Ravens, New York Jets and Miami Dolphins.\n\nBrad Gagnon from Bleacher Report outlined the Patriots’ ideal scenario for the remainder of the regular season.\n\n“Beat the Ravens on the road in Week 16 to show some much-needed resiliency, then clinch the AFC East title by taking care of the division-rival Jets and/or Dolphins to close out the regular season,” Gagnon wrote on Wednesday.\n\nThe Patriots can secure a playoff spot with a win or a tie against the Ravens this Sunday. However, New England will need to wait for the outcome of the last two weeks, which will be determined by division opponents, to see if it can clinch the AFC East title.\n\nNew England currently has an 11-3 record, while Buffalo is at 10-4. If the Patriots win their remaining games, they will secure the AFC East title. However, after losing to Buffalo in Week 15, they lost the head-to-head tiebreaker, as the Patriots and Bills split their matchups this season.\n\nThe next tiebreaker is based on wins against division opponents. The Patriots have a 3-1 record, while the Bills are 3-2 following their loss to the Dolphins.\n\nEven if the Patriots lose to the Ravens but defeat the Jets and Dolphins, New England will still claim the AFC East title, even if the Bills win all their remaining games.\n\nPatriots-Ravens Injury Report: Lamar Jackson Among Starters Missing On Both Sides",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "description": "Manhattan federal prosecutors have charged Tricolor execs Daniel Chu and David Goodgame of scheming to defraud banks and private credit lenders.",
    "fullText": "Founder Daniel Chu and the company's Chief Operating Officer David Goodgame, who were arrested and charged with bank fraud and wire fraud on Wednesday, planned to frighten at least one lender into a favorable deal, prosecutors allege. According to the indictment, the executives discussed telling a lender that the company might otherwise implode, much like the energy trading firm Enron in 2001, if a deal wasn't reached. This would be bad for the lender because it would put them at risk of losing everything.\n\n\"Enron obviously has a nice ring to it, right?\" Chu said when discussing with other Tricolor executives how to deal with one particular lender who had figured out the double-pledging issue.\n\n\"I mean, Enron, Enron raises the blood pressure of the lender when they see that. It, it has to, right?\" Chu said while laughing, documents show.\n\nIt's just one of several recorded conversations that emerged as part of a newly unsealed indictment against Chu and Goodgame. The indictment accused the men of orchestrating a years-long scheme to defraud banks and other private credit providers.\n\nChu is expected to be presented in a Florida court on Wednesday. Goodgame should be presented in a Texas court on Thursday. The men could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nTricolor rocked the banking industry when it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September, leaving lenders like JPMorgan, Fifth Third Bank, and Jefferies exposed.\n\nAt the time of the company's September 10 bankruptcy, its largest lenders were owed more than $900 million \"as a result of the fraudulent double-pledging and collateral manipulation schemes\" orchestrated by Chu and supported by Goodgame, the feds said.\n\nBut that didn't stop Chu from using company money to enrich himself, according to prosecutors. They said Chu directed another executive to pay him the final installments of a $15 million bonus as the company approached bankruptcy, resulting in two payments from Tricolor totaling $6.25 million. Chu then used some of this money to purchase a multimillion-dollar property in Beverly Hills, California — weeks before Tricolor filed for Chapter 7, the feds said.\n\nThe back-to-back bankruptcies of Tricolor and auto parts company First Brands have raised questions about the health of the credit market, prompting JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon to tell investors that he has his \"antenna\" up.\n\n\"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,\" Dimon said on the bank's third-quarter earnings call with analysts.",

He has not yet made a formal announcement.\n\nTo back the claims, however, the newspaper’s sources further revealed that Bongino has begun shipping office “knick-knacks” and other personal belongings back to Florida, where he plans to resume his broadcasting career in time for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nSources told Fox News Digital on Monday that Bongino had not made a final decision and denied his office was empty, but did add that he was expected to declare his intentions in the coming weeks.\n\nThe former podcaster arrived at the FBI this year promising disruption and ideological clarity, after President Donald Trump nominated him.\n\nHowever, the Times reported that earlier this month, Bongino floated the idea of choreographing his exit around a major law enforcement moment to associates. He allegedly said he may announce his resignation at a press conference tied to the investigation into who planted pipe bombs near Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the January 6 riots in 2021.\n\nThe newspaper added that behind-the-scenes, Bongino has also made a point of repairing relations with Attorney General Pam Bondi, whom he had accused of mishandling the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein in July.\n\nAt that time, he reportedly threatened to resign after Bondi’s department released a memo concluding that the much-hyped “Epstein client list” did not, in fact, exist – a topic that had been a focus of Bongino’s podcast before his tenure.\n\nThe post Dan Bongino Clearing Out His Office in Preparation for FBI Exit: NY Times first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Keir Starmer’s office claims UK still in ‘active conversations’ about deal for tech industries in both countries to cooperate\n\nDowning Street insists the $40bn Tech Prosperity Deal between the US and UK that is on hold is not permanently stalled. The BBC reported on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.\n\nThe agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The New York Times first reported British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.\n\n“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.\n\nThe Trade Representative’s office said in a post on Twitter/X that these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.\n\n“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.\n\nThomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to the New York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.\n\nThe retaliation by the US follows a $140m fine slapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.",
