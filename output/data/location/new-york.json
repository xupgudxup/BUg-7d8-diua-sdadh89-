    "description": "Stephen A. Smith forgot the 2020 MLB season was shortened due to Covid-19 when he claimed New York Mets star Pete Alonso was injured and barely played.",
    "fullText": "Stephen A. Smith seemingly forgot the 2020 MLB season was shortened due to Covid-19 when he claimed New York Mets star Pete Alonso was injured and barely played.\n\nOn Wednesday, ESPN’s Jeff Passan announced that Alonso agreed to a five-year, $155 million deal to join the Baltimore Orioles. Alonso, 31, played his first seven seasons in the MLB with the Mets and was considered one of the faces of the franchise.\n\nBREAKING: First baseman Pete Alonso and the Baltimore Orioles are finalizing a five-year, $155 million contract, sources tell ESPN. Alonso leaves the Mets to make a loaded AL East even better.\n\n— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) December 10, 2025\n\nHours later, Smith reacted to the news on The Stephen A. Smith Show. First, he lambasted the Mets for allowing star closer Edwin Diaz to sign with the rival Los Angeles Dodgers. He applied that same criticism to Alonso’s departure.\n\nWhile talking about Alonso’s stats, however, Smith appeared to overlook a vitally important piece of context:\n\nHe’s been in the league about seven years. Let’s look at him, alright? He got injured in year two. So, he hits 53 home runs and 120 RBIs his first year in 2019. Next year, he gets hurt, only played in 57 games. Still smacks 16 home runs, 35 RBIs. Next year, 37 home runs, 94 RBIs. The year after that, 2022, 40 home runs, 131 RBIs.\n\nTo Smith’s credit, he quickly realized his mistake with the 2020 season. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the MLB regular season was only 60 games. With 57 games played, Alonso appeared in nearly every game of that shortened season.\n\n“Actually, 2020 was Covid,” Smith clarified. “I apologize. You gotta remember that, because there was a truncated season because all the stuff that was going on in Covid.”\n\nUnfortunately for Smith, the damage was already done and social media users rushed to roast him for the error.\n\nStephen A Smith said Pete Alonso \"got hurt and only played in 57 games his 2nd season\", when really it was the 60 game shortened COVID season\n\n— Fuzzy (@fuzzyfromyt) December 11, 2025\n\nSAS and @ColinCowherd have made a fortune talking about sports despite knowing nothing about sports. It's legit impressive. https://t.co/sdFldE7oIR\n\n— Funhouse (@BackAftaThis) December 12, 2025\n\nHas anyone ever brought up the fact that these guys are simply on TV so often that it’s actually not shocking at all that they don’t follow sports? https://t.co/ZpAeKvuRDl\n\n— Tim Kalinowski (@TimmyKal12) December 12, 2025\n\nHighest paid sports \"commentator\" in the business btw https://t.co/fN2CvjZbgj\n\n— Dean Kremer Enjoyer (@DK_Enj) December 11, 2025\n\nThis clown is the highest paid employee at ESPN https://t.co/JgIjYkf17t\n\n— cg (@colingreten) December 12, 2025\n\nAnd to think Stephen A. Smith gets paid over $100 million to spew nonsense like this day in and day out, with no pushback from anyone with real power.

    "fullText": "Before Jalen Brunson, Knicks reportedly pulled out all the stops for Kevin Durant originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLong before Jalen Brunson, the New York Knicks swung and missed on countless attempts to lure another superstar to the Big Apple. The Carmelo Anthony-Amar’e Stoudemire days were long gone, and the Kristaps Porzingis era never truly took off.\n\nBack in 2019, the Knicks had a perfect opportunity to make a statement. Kevin Durant was going to be a free agent, and the open secret around the league was that he wanted to move to New York City, where his company had its headquarters.\n\nWith that in mind, Knicks owner James Dolan made sure to get his best people on the job. As revealed by investigative journalist Pablo Torre on his “Pablo Torre Finds Out” podcast, the Knicks actually hired the Wu-Tang Clan to record a recruiting song and video to get the future Hall of Famer on the team.\n\nWu-Tang Clan founding member Method Man confirmed that the legendary hip-hop band was gladly on board with the idea, since they knew Durant wanted to be in New York and they’re all Knicks fans:\n\n“I don’t remember the track, but I remember we shot a visual for it,” Method Man said. \"We really wanted KD to come, and I knew that KD wanted to come to New York. He just wasn't clear on where he wanted to go.\"\n\nThe video, dubbed  \"The Multi-Million Dollar Wu-Tang Clan Music Video Meant for One Person,” showed Wu-Tang Clan members wearing Durant’s Knicks jersey, and it featured an epilogue in which several members of the band made their pitches to lure the two-time NBA champion to Madison Square Garden.\n\nDurant ultimately headed to New York, but he signed with the Brooklyn Nets instead. He teamed up with Kyrie Irving and hoped to take the Eastern Conference by storm, but it didn’t take long before that team imploded.\n\nDespite having a plethora of All-Stars along the way, such as James Harden and then Ben Simmons, injuries and their dysfunctional nature ultimately doomed the Nets, and they’re still trying to work their way back up.\n\nAs for the Knicks, they wound up trading for Jalen Brunson a couple of years later. He’s now become the face of the franchise, and with fellow Villanova stars Mikal Bridges and Josh Hart, plus Karl-Anthony Towns and OG Anunoby, they have one of the strongest teams in the East.\n\nDurant, on the other hand, is now on his third team after leaving Golden State, and he has yet to return to the NBA Finals.",

The real-time 2026 NFL draft order is becoming clearer every week.\n\nThe Jets are slated to possess two first-round picks in 2026, their own and the one originally belonging to the Indianapolis Colts, as a result of the Sauce Gardner blockbuster trade. New York entered the weekend with their own selection at No. 7 overall and it did not change following Sunday's results.\n\nFive 3-10 teams are currently scheduled to own picks 4-8, and head coach Aaron Glenn's squad has the second-best strength of schedule (.541) among that group.\n\nThe Jets stay at No. 7 in the draft order, per ⁦@tankathon⁩ pic.twitter.com/M3Sl1GqZk7\n\n— Brian Costello (@BrianCoz) December 8, 2025\n\nIn better news, the pick originally belonging to the Colts was slated for 23rd overall entering Week 14. Following the Colts' blowout loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, it has improved to No. 21. Starting quarterback Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles injury and Indianapolis fell to third place in the AFC South.\n\nThe Jets still don't own a top-five selection. If quarterbacks Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields aren't able to return following their Week 14 injuries, it's difficult to imagine the Jets winning a game with rookie undrafted QB Brady Cook in the lineup.

    "description": "The New York Times said it would not “be deterred by false and inflammatory language” in response to President Donald Trump’s latest attack on the outlet for reporting on his age.",
    "fullText": "The New York Times said on Wednesday that it would not “be deterred by false and inflammatory language” in response to President Donald Trump’s latest claim that the outlet’s reporting on his age was an attempt to “libel and demean” him.\n\nThe paper said its audience deserved “in-depth reporting and regular updates about the health of the leaders they elect.” The statement came in response to Trump’s Tuesday attack against the paper, apparently over a November article focused on his declining energy, which argued the Times should “cease publication because they are a horrible, biased, and untruthful ‘source’ of information.”\n\n“Mr. Trump welcomed our reporting on the age and fitness of his predecessors; we’re applying the same journalistic scrutiny to his vitality,” spokesperson Nicole Taylor wrote in a statement. “Our reporting is heavily sourced, based on interviews with people clsoe to the president and with medical experts. We won’t be deterred by false and inflammatory language that distorts the role of a free press.”\n\nStill, such an approach to news coverage didn’t seem to resonate with Trump, who claimed again that his cognitive test results were something few people, “including those working at The New York Times,” could do very well.\n\n“Despite all of this, the time and work involved, The New York Times, and some others, like to pretend that I am ‘slowing up,’ am maybe not as sharp as I once was, or am in poor physical health, knowing that it is not true, and knowing that I work very hard, probably harder than I have ever worked before,” Trump wrote. “I will know when I am ‘slowing up,’ but it’s not now! After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe it’s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean  ‘THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.’ They are true Enemies of the People, and we should do something about it.”\n\nThe Times’ Katie Rogers and Dylan Freedman reported last month that Trump has started his events later in recent months and his public appearances had decreased. They wrote that, while “Trump and the people around him still talk about him as if he is the Energizer Bunny of presidential politics,” “the reality is more complicated.”\n\nTrump lashed out at the paper hours after the story published, calling Rogers “ugly, both inside and out” for writing the story and claimed then that the paper was an “ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.”\n\nThe post New York Times Blasts Trump’s ‘False and Inflammatory’ Claim That Reporting on His Health Could Be Libelous appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 75-year-old Laurence Gerowitz, a real estate litigator, about his move into a larger condo in New York City. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI lived on the Upper East Side for most of my adult life: about 48 years, starting in the late 1970s. My wife and I bought into a co-op on 85th Street in 1999 for $265,000 and lived on the third floor of the five-story walk-up.\n\nOur apartment was 1,200 square feet and had a very nice layout, as well as a working fireplace. The building had no amenities whatsoever, but we were still very happy to be there. We lived there for 25 years and essentially raised our son in that apartment.\n\nIn 2008, he moved to Villanova, Pennsylvania — near Philadelphia — for college, and over the years it became clear he was never moving back to New York. He's now married and they live there with their two young children.\n\nNew York suits me just fine, but not so much for my son — between the impossible parking and our three-story walk-up, he wasn't interested.\n\nI understand why. When he used to visit, I'd have to go downstairs to help him haul everything up. We did have two bedrooms, which is a luxury in Manhattan, but there still wasn't a comfortable place for him and his family to sleep, and I'd end up on a blow-up mattress.\n\nIt was just untenable; they didn't enjoy visiting.\n\nAbout two years ago, my wife noticed that a new complex was being built around the corner from us called the Harper. She's a painter and interior decorator, so she wanted to take a look.\n\nWe toured a two-bedroom apartment, which we thought was very nice, but it was also small. Still, we thought the building's amenities were fantastic. They have a gym, music room, game room, playroom, and creative studio — which we thought would be great for our grandkids.\n\nWe sat with the idea for a while. A couple of months later, we went back to see a larger unit — a model of about 1,853 square feet with an 80-square-foot terrace and three bedrooms, one of which could be used as an office.\n\nAfter that tour, it didn't take us long to decide to move to the Harper. In the end, it took a couple of months to stage our old co-op, and then a few more months to sell.\n\nThe best things I've ever done in my life are being a good father and grandfather. My son texts or calls me at least once a day, and that's my proudest accomplishment — even more than being admitted to the bar at 48 after going to night school for four years while supporting a family.\n\nA big reason we decided to upsize and buy the condo was that my wife and I love being around my son and his family, and we really wanted to create a place where the kids would want to come visit.\n\nWe moved into the Harper in March 2024. It's just around the corner from our old place. It wasn't a far move, but we've spent decades living on the Upper East Side for a reason — we love the neighborhood.\n\nOur new condo has a really well-thought-out layout. We have three bedrooms, including a home office, and two-and-a-half bathrooms. When you walk in, you can turn left into one wing, down that hall are the primary closet, the primary bedroom and bathroom, and the terrace.\n\nIf you go to the right instead, a quick left takes you into the kitchen and great room. Further to the right are the guest bedroom and bathroom, a third bedroom that I use as my office, and a small laundry area.\n\nBesides having a larger apartment and living in a building that actually has an elevator, we're especially happy about the amenities. It's such a contrast to our old place, where the only extra space was the boiler room.\n\nOur grandkids especially love the building's music room. They can bang on the drums, sing into the microphone, and strum a guitar. There's also a playroom with a ball pit.\n\nIn the beginning, whenever the grandkids would come over, they would go down to the ball pit three times a day. In the mornings, I'd have to plead with them to finish their breakfast before heading down to play.\n\nIt's obvious they love visiting our new home. The grandkids talk about it all the time, and it's cute to see them arrive, dragging their little suitcases, already excited to play.\n\nI have very fond memories of our old place — it was the first home I ever bought. But over time, living there became stressful.\n\nI was on the board, constantly worrying about the building — especially whether the boiler would work. It was an older property with no central air, just radiators, so there were always issues with the heat.\n\nHere at the Harper, it's a completely different experience. Everything works, we have three separate HVAC zones that you can set to the exact degree, and the staff is great. My biggest dilemma now is whether to go to my gym on 91st Street or just head downstairs.\n\nI think upsizing later in life is a good thing if you're in a position where it makes sense for you.\n\nIf it's within your means to make that choice, do it. You're not just gaining more physical space; you're also giving yourself and your family more options.\n\nWhen my son and his family visit, they have their own rooms and are well taken care of. I think they genuinely enjoy coming now; it no longer feels like an obligation.",

    "fullText": "Mets slammed as “doomed” by former MLB execs after Alonso news originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt took less than a day for the mood of New York Mets’ observers to hit rock bottom. After losing All-Star closer Edwin Diaz to the Los Angeles Dodgers, former MLB general managers Jim Duquette, Jim Bowden and Steve Phillips spent the morning on MLB Network Radio suggesting the New York Mets should be “panicked.” Hours later, it was reported that Pete Alonso agreed to a five-year, $155 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles, and the same group reportedly shifted their tone to “doomed.”\n\nSNY broadcaster and former Met Ron Darling on MLB Network’s MLB Tonight said he was “flabbergasted.”\n\nAlonso’s departure is not only a big blow to the Mets’ offseason plans, but it ends a franchise era.\n\nAlonso, who turned 31 Sunday,  hit .272 with 38 home runs, 126 RBI and an .871 OPS over 162 games last season. He finishes his Mets tenure with 264 career home runs, the most in franchise history, along with 712 RBI and a .253 career batting average.\n\nThat’s elite middle-of-the-order production vanishing overnight.\n\nNew York also missed on a potential left-handed power fit when Kyle Schwarber re-signed with Philadelphia.  Brandon Nimmo’s departure via trade to the Texas Rangers for Marcus Semien creates even more questions for the Mets.\n\nEven at closer, the Mets are asked to trust Devin Williams, a new arrival and high-pressure answer after Diaz left for Los Angeles on a three-year, $69 million deal. Mets GM David Stearns said they think that Williams’ career-worst year against the Mets in 2025 was because he was “unlucky.”\n\nWith the biggest names gone, Stearns must get creative. Options remain, but none come without risk — and none replace Alonso’s presence by themselves.\n\nHere are the most realistic paths still on the board:\n\nCody Bellinger\nA lefty bat with defensive flexibility in the outfield and at first base. Once an MVP-caliber slugger, he hit .272 with 29 homers last season.\n\nOne of the few impact bats left on the market after 2025: last season he hit .266 with 22 home runs, 73 RBI, 91 runs scored, and compiled an .841 OPS in 136 games.\n\nAlex Bregman\nA high-floor infielder who could stabilize the batting order, but doesn’t replace pure first-base power. He’s one of the bigger bats still available.\n\nBo Bichette\nMore contact hitter than slugger, but an impact offensive piece who could reshape the overall lineup profile.\n\nThose names provide lineup value, but the Mets lost production and popular players.\n\nAlsono was not only a durable first baseman who has led the MLB in home runs since his debut. Diaz was a closer who electrified Citi Field with his entrances and dominated in high leverage.  Fans identified with them, and their teammates reportedly embraced them.\n\nThe former GMs on MLB Network Radio have seen enough offseasons to know when desperation is creeping in. Two franchise pillars are gone. The division remains brutal. And the fan base just watched its most iconic slugger pack for Baltimore.\n\nDarling was blunt in his assessment, too.\n\n\"This is a real loss for the New York Mets,\" Darling said.\n\nIf the Mets don’t respond aggressively and fast, this winter may be remembered not as a turning point but as a full-scale collapse.",

The news comes a day after the Mets’ long-term closer, Edwin Díaz, reached a three-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe 31-year-old slugger had been unable to find a long-term deal last season and returned to the Mets on a shorter contract, which he opted out of after this year’s World Series. While the Mets were interested in re-signing him they reportedly never made an offer once other teams were willing to offer longer, more valuable deals to the the first baseman.\n\nAlonso has spent his entire MLB career with the Mets, and last season broke Darryl Strawberry’s franchise record for home runs. He ends his Mets career with 264 home runs. He was also incredibly popular with the team’s fans due to his good-nature and power, earning the nickname Polar Bear. The Mets also lost another long-term popular player, Brandon Nimmo, last month in a trade with the Texas Rangers.\n\nAlonso had one of the best offensive seasons of his career in 2025 – he hit .272 with 38 home runs and 126 RBIs – but there are concerns about his defense, a weak point for the Mets, and base running, and the Mets appeared reluctant to give him a multi-year deal when they have already have Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor on expensive, long-term contracts.",

    "fullText": "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — Brady Cook will take the snaps with the New York Jets' starters at practice Wednesday, opening the possibility the undrafted rookie quarterback could start Sunday at Jacksonville.\n\nCoach Aaron Glenn said neither Tyrod Taylor nor Justin Fields will participate on the field while dealing with injuries, and the team will see how both quarterbacks feel as the week progresses.\n\n“There's a plan for the quarterbacks,” Glenn said. “Either way it works out during the week, we've got all our bases covered.”\n\nTaylor made his third straight start for the benched Fields last Sunday before injuring his groin late in the first quarter of the Jets' 34-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins. Cook, who was Taylor's backup because Fields was ruled out ahead of the game with knee soreness, filled in and went 14 of 30 for 163 yards and two interceptions in his NFL regular-season debut.\n\n“I thought he did a pretty good job,” Glenn said of Cook’s performance. “It was a tough situation for him with Tyrod going down and him not getting all the reps with the first team.”\n\nNew York also signed Adrian Martinez to the practice squad after he was released Tuesday by San Francisco. Martinez, the 2024 UFL MVP and UFL championship game MVP, was with the Jets through training camp this past summer.\n\nCook, who was sacked six times and came up limping slightly at one point in the game against the Dolphins, will be listed on the injury report but Glenn said he'll be fine. The coach was looking forward to Cook getting snaps with the starters Wednesday.\n\n“Man, that does a lot for every quarterback, especially if we're getting him to building continuity with the rest of the guys,” Glenn said.\n\nCook, who threw for 9,008 yards and 49 touchdowns with 15 interceptions in five seasons at Missouri, was signed to the active roster Saturday. He had been promoted from the practice squad for two previous games this season, but hadn’t played in the regular season.\n\nCook was 25 of 38 for 235 yards and a touchdown with one interception in three preseason games.\n\nThe Jets (3-10), who were eliminated from playoff contention for the 15th straight season, are dealing with several other injuries.\n\nGlenn said running back Breece Hall, tight ends Mason Taylor and Stone Smartt, defensive lineman Harrison Phillips, linebackers Quincy Williams and Kiko Mauigoa, and cornerback Azareye'h Thomas won't practice as they deal with various ailments. Glenn added that some of the players are simply being rested.\n\nStar wide receiver Garrett Wilson is eligible to come off injured reserve after sitting four games with a knee injury, but Glenn said he hasn't yet been cleared to practice.\n\nThe Jets signed defensive lineman Eric Watts to the active roster and placed rookie D-lineman Tyler Baron on injured reserve after he hurt a knee against Miami.\n\nTight end Nick Muse, a seventh-round draft pick out of Minnesota in 2022, was signed to the practice squad. He was most recently with the Los Angeles Rams, who released him Tuesday, and also had stints with Philadelphia and Arizona.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "title": "Look inside the Armour-Stiner Octagon House, an ornate 19th-century mansion in New York, decorated for the holidays",
    "description": "The Armour-Stiner Octagon House in Irvington, New York, is a whimsical example of a 19th-century, eight-sided mansion.",
    "fullText": "In the mid-19th century, the concept of octagon houses was all the rage among fashionable Americans.\n\nIts popularity was attributed to a best-selling 1848 book by Orson Squire Fowler, a phrenologist, sexologist, and amateur architect, called \"The Octagon House: A Home For All.\"\n\nFowler championed eight-sided houses because they received twice as much light as a traditional four-sided property and allowed owners to view the grounds from all angles.\n\nThe Armour-Stiner Octagon House in the New York City suburb of Irvington-on-Hudson, around 18 miles from the northern tip of Manhattan, is a prime example of the genre.\n\nUnusually for an octagon house, it features a giant dome, added by its second owner, Joseph H. Stiner, a wealthy tea and coffee merchant who bought the property in 1872.\n\nThe result is a fairytale residence that its current owner, Joseph Pell Lombardi, lovingly restored, beginning in 1978. The preservation architect purchased it from the National Trust for Historic Preservation for $75,000 (equivalent to $387,300 today), with certain conditions, including stabilizing the structure and dome.\n\nIn his book, \"The Armour-Stiner (Octagon) House,\" Lombardi said his goal was \"to hold together the fragile exotic beauty of this lyrical home.\"\n\nThe 8,000-square-foot property, which was restored to its original 1870s glory, is open to the public through private tours that must be reserved in advance.\n\nTake a look inside the residence while it is decked out for a Victorian-style Christmas.\n\nThe octagonal mansion began life as a flat-roofed, two-story building with a raised basement commissioned by New York City banker Paul J. Armour.\n\nArmour died in 1866, just six years after buying the house. His widow, Rebecca, went on to sell it to Stiner for $27,000 in 1872.\n\nThe Hungarian-born businessman, who made his fortune from importing products such as tea, coffee, and cocoa, rebuilt his summer and weekend retreat in the form of an ancient classical temple with more than 20 rooms.\n\nStiner, a father of six, whose family lived in the house for only 10 years, built the 56-column veranda that surrounds the first story, resembling a fairground carousel.\n\nGuests are greeted by cast-stone lions flanking the sweeping stairs that lead to the structure, which features elaborate gas lamps and a cast-iron railing.\n\nIt allows visitors to view the grounds from every perspective, offering sun and shade depending on where they choose to sit and the time of day.\n\nTour guide Kate Mincer, who greeted our group of four at the door, explained how Stiner turned the house into a \"temple of whimsy\" by bringing in interesting motifs and designs from around the world.\n\nThe walls of the entry hall are adorned with silver leaf and stenciled decorations in trompe l'oeil neo-Baroque frames.\n\nMincer also highlighted the miniature antique Christmas tree, made from goose feathers dyed green, with traditional, hand-blown glass ornaments from Germany.\n\nStiner's wife, Hannah, impressed visitors with her immaculate salon, which featured a bay window that flooded the room with light.\n\n\"Hannah's era was the lead-up to the really showy time period of the Gilded Age,\" Mincer said. \"But this room has the kind of detail you would see in opera houses in Europe, not necessarily in private summer cottages.\"\n\nThe space features a parlor suite by the renowned 19th-century furniture maker John Jelliff, which includes two sofas, an armchair, and an armless chair designed to accommodate ladies' skirts.\n\nFor the holiday season, the Christmas tree in the salon is covered in colorful ornaments, including layered decorations crafted from embossed cardboard, foil, and paper, accented with antique trimmings.\n\nMany were handmade by Jessica Lombardi, the museum director, and a team of docents who copied the Dresden style of ornament making, which originated in Germany in the late 19th century.\n\nThe Stiners, who eventually moved into the house year-round, supported landscape painters from the 19th-century Hudson River School of Art.\n\nMost of the images are local to Irvington-on-Hudson, with views of the Palisades along the Hudson River and a particularly wide section of the river known as the Tappan Zee.\n\nAn oil canvas by Robert Havell Jr. is a 1866 depiction of the nearby Old Dutch Church, made famous by author Washington Irving's \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\"\n\nThe dining room is the only room in the Octagon House with a rounded space, inspired by the theme of a Roman temple.\n\nIt contains a Renaissance Revival walnut dining table with semi-circular ends, adding an unusual touch.\n\nMuseum staff have meticulously set the table for Christmas Day, 1872, the year Stiner bought the property. The dining table features a menu that lists dishes such as roast goose or croquettes wrapped in bacon, finishing with plum pudding.\n\nThe silverware is Reed & Barton Roman Medallion 1870s flatware, featuring a Roman centurion's head at its base.\n\nCurrent owner Joseph Pell Lombardi discovered one of the pieces at the bottom of a dumbwaiter in 1978. It led to a two-decade search to acquire the complete set.\n\nThe triangular-shaped pantry includes original cabinets, a dumb waiter, and a soft copper sink, designed to minimize the risk of damage to crockery during the washing up.\n\nThe first-floor kitchen, with its writing desk for planning menus and a cast-iron stove, was designed for the lady of the house, despite the servants she employed.\n\nMincer explained how, within the era, the writers Harriet Beecher Stowe and her sister, Catharine Beecher, suggested that gentlewomen should take an active role in household proceedings.\n\n\"Most of the cooking was done elsewhere, but this was Mrs. Stiner's hub,\" the guide said.\n\nThe kitchen contains a selection of Joseph Stiner & Co. Importers' tea and coffee tins, including one that lists the merchant's chain of shops in Manhattan.\n\n\"At the height of his success, Mr. Stiner was basically Starbucks before Starbucks,\" Mincer joked.\n\nThe second story of the house was reserved for the Stiner family, who would relax and sleep there. It felt more cozy than downstairs.\n\nThe color palettes are softer, but the gasolier in this particular room, the former primary bedroom, is no less ornate.\n\nOne bedroom visible on the tour has a set of so-called \"cottage furniture,\" made by Hart, Ware & Co. Their designs became a fad in the mid-19th century.\n\nA more affordable type of wood, such as pine, was painted to resemble the look of ebony. The Armour-Stiner Octagon House pieces — including the bed, dresser, and side tables — come with gold filigree and river scenes.\n\nAnother interesting detail is the stretch of fabric that conceals the otherwise unattractive mechanism connecting the gasolier to the ceiling.\n\nLombardi turned one of the children's bedrooms into a curio room — basically a home museum — to reflect the Victorian obsession with natural specimens, such as mounted butterflies.\n\nIt also houses a 19th-century, patented Wooton desk with numerous drawers and nooks and crannies for ordering and storing items of interest.\n\nThe old-fashioned greeting cards are in the style of the illustrator Louis Prang, who popularized their distribution by mail. He became known as \"the father of the American Christmas card.\"\n\nMany depict flowers such as peonies and roses, while the later versions show wintry scenes trimmed with lace.\n\n\"We have images of St. Nicholas wearing purple, green, and brown instead of the iconic red suit,\" Mincer told our group, adding that Santa Claus had yet to solidify into the familiar character we now know.\n\nThe solo children's bedroom on the tour is situated on the third floor of the house. It has a homely feel with a spruce floor and porcelain doorknobs.\n\nOld-fashioned toys in the room include a teddy bear and dolls dressed in Victorian attire.\n\nLong shelves in the child's bedroom house Lionel train sets dating from 1910, depicting 1870s luxury Pullman passenger cars.\n\nThey were collected for display, along with the period lithograph prints of the actual trains, which ran on the Hudson River Railroad and were the height of luxury during the Stiners' time.\n\nMincer said the mistress of the house practiced dancing and watercolors in the high-ceilinged room with large, north-facing windows.\n\nIt contains a complete Egyptian Revival furniture set created by the prestigious New York manufacturers Pottier & Stymer, who were highly sought after in the 1870s.\n\nThe Lombardi family visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art to photograph the company's rare examples of Egyptian Revival art on display. They spent months recreating the designs to fit the suite. Its upholstery was woven in the Aubusson style.\n\nThe Egyptian Revival spinet piano brought music to the room. It is adorned with Egyptian hieroglyphics. \"The designs weren't accurate, but resembled how people from that era thought they looked,\" Mincer said.\n\nThe table opposite the piano displays a silver menorah on top, reflecting the Stiner's Jewish faith ahead of Hanukkah.\n\nThe fourth and fifth floors of the house are off-limits to visitors, partly because the steep stairs don't meet current building codes.\n\nOn a previous visit, before the code was introduced, I toured the unpartitioned dance room, which features eight windows and a spiral staircase up to the observatory. It commands beautiful views of the Hudson River.\n\nThe holiday tours take place during the day, but it's possible to see the house festively lit up at night from the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail, which borders the property.\n\nI made a quick return visit to see the exterior lights on the night of my tour and was reminded of the splendor inside.\n\nLombardi certainly stayed true to that ambitious pledge of holding \"together the fragile exotic beauty of this lyrical home.\"",

    "description": "The Kansas City Chiefs will have needs at both running back and wide receiver to address during the offseason. As a result, an ESPN insider named Kansas City as a possible landing spots for Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets and Jacksonville Jaguars free agents.",
    "fullText": "ESPN insider names Chiefs as landing spot for Colts, Jets, Jaguars pending free agents originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTwo positions the Kansas City Chiefs will have to take a long, hard look at this coming offseason are running back and wide receiver.\n\nAt running back, both Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco are pending free agents, and neither one has been that good this season, so the Chiefs could use an upgrade.\n\nAt wide receiver, Kansas City desperately needs to add a deep threat to bring some explosiveness to an offense that has lacked it since Tyreek Hill was traded.\n\nIn their weekly NFL buzz article, ESPN's Dan Graziano and Jeremy Fowler agree that the Chiefs need to make a move at both positions.\n\nAs a result, Fowler suggests the Chiefs as possible landing spots for New York Jets running back Breece Hall, Jacksonville Jaguars rusher Travis Etienne, and Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Alec Pierce.\n\nThe Chiefs and Ravens are both teams that need a classic boundary receiver on the outside and could address that with one big move in free agency. George Pickens would be a significant upgrade in Baltimore, and Alec Pierce would satisfy that need in Kansas City, which has been starved for explosive playmaking on the outside since Tyreek Hill was traded after the 2021 season.\n\nBoth would be costly, and Pickens might be franchise tagged by Dallas. But if available, the Ravens could use some of their $40 million in 2026 cap space on Pickens, knowing John Harbaugh is good at managing big personalities. The Chiefs are much lower on space, sitting at minus-$42.8 million, but cuts are on the way for a team that might look drastically different this time next year. Also, adding an explosive running back such as Breece Hall or Travis Etienne Jr. is worth exploring for Kansas City.\n\nOf course, all three of those players are pending free agents, but we wouldn't expect all three to actually hit the open market.\n\nHall is the one we could see getting the franchise tag, which would enable the Jets to get something for him via trade instead of letting him walk for nothing.\n\nWe wouldn't rule out the Jets extending him, either, although Hall might not be amenable to that and could want a change of scenery from the lowly Jets.\n\nAdding Hall would be a great move for Kansas City, as the veteran rusher can add a much-needed explosive element to the Chiefs' offense, both as a runner and pass-catcher, thanks to his home-run ability.\n\nAs fun as it would be to see Hall, who drew interest from the Chiefs at the trade deadline last month, playing in Andy Reid's offense, we would consider that happening highly unlikely.\n\nNot only would the Chiefs have to give up draft capital to acquire Hall, assuming he gets the franchise tag, they would also have to pay him a lucrative, long-term deal that Spotrac projects will cost around $10.4 million annually.\n\nWe just don't see the Chiefs jumping through all those hoops. Now, if Hall hits free agency and Kansas City can sign him outright, that changes things.\n\nEtienne is the more realistic target, as he will hit the open market, barring the Jags extending him beforehand, which remains a possibility after what has been a bounce-back year for him.\n\nBut the Jaguars also invested a fourth-round pick in Bhayshul Tuten and the team is only projected to have $9.4 million in cap space, so they might opt to take the cheaper route at running back.\n\nSpotrac projects a much more reasonable contract for Etienne at $6.6 million per year over two years. That is much \n\nEtienne isn't as explosive as Hall, but he'd still provide a sizeable upgrade over Hunt and Pacheco, both as a rusher and pass-catcher.\n\nAs for Pierce, he'd be exactly what the doctor ordered for the Chiefs' passing attack, as he's one of the best big-play weapons in the NFL, as evidenced by his league-leading 20.2 yards per reception this season.\n\nPierce, who is in the midst of a career-best season and is only 25, has never posted elite production, but that will also help keep his price down a bit.\n\nSpotrac projects Pierce will land a four-year, $63.9 million contract, which amounts to $16 million annually. That would be a fair price for a receiver who would check a huge box for KC while providing a perfect complement to Rashee Rice.\n\nThe Colts are going to be keen on keeping Pierce, though, and unlike the Chiefs, Indy is going to have plenty of funds to keep him around.\n\nRavens named possible landing spot for Cowboys' pending free agent\n\nBroncos have six ways to clinch a playoff berth in Week 15\n\nPatriots AFC East, playoff-clinching scenarios for Week 15\n\nFun age-related Philip Rivers facts as QB comes out of retirement\n\nCowboys' updated outlook in NFC East after Eagles' loss\n\nPhilip Rivers' first child is older than this many Colts players",

Columbus prospect didn’t have an exceptional senior year of high school, either, throwing for just about 1,100 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nHe redshirted in Berkeley in 2022 and was the backup for the first half of the 2023 season until getting his first opportunity in Week 6 against Oregon State and never looking back.\n\nAfter throwing for 3,000 yards and 16 touchdowns in 2024, Mendoza hit the transfer portal and has starred at Indiana this season leading the Hoosiers to an undefeated regular season and then beating Ohio State in the Big 10 championship.\n\nIf Justyn Martin from Inglewood, Calif., did not de-commit from the Golden Bears in late September, one wonders if Mendoza would have ever been offered by Cal at all – and whether Yale would have had a Heisman frontrunner on its hands.\n\nRated as the second-best quarterback behind only Florida’s DJ Lagway as a five-star prospect, Sayin committed to Alabama over Georgia and LSU as Michigan, Notre Dame and others were involved earlier but the Carlsbad, Calif., standout shied away from playing in the cold weather.\n\nPlaying for coach Nick Saban – and offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien – were huge draws for Sayin to pick the Crimson Tide but a few short weeks after arriving in Tuscaloosa, Saban retired and O’Brien left for Boston College.\n\nThen-Washington coach Kalen DeBoer got the Alabama job and according to the book The Price: What it Takes to Win in College Football’s Era of Chaos, the new Crimson Tide coach made Sayin wait to meet him and then acted like he didn’t know who he was during the short meeting.\n\nThe former five-star transferred to Ohio State, sat behind Will Howard last season as the Buckeyes won the national championship and then Sayin won the starting job leading Ohio State to the No. 2 overall ranking in the College Football Playoff.\n\nSo far this season, Sayin has thrown for 3,323 yards with 31 touchdowns and six interceptions.\n\nA three-star junior college prospect at New Mexico Military Institute, Pavia then transferred to New Mexico State where in 2023 he led the Aggies to a shocking 31-10 win at Auburn and emerged as one of the hottest quarterbacks in the transfer portal after that season.\n\nAfter two seasons at New Mexico State, Pavia has now spent two seasons at Vanderbilt and the Commodores at 10-2 have their first double-digit winning season in program history dating back to 1902.\n\nPavia in many ways has taken the college football world by storm over the last two years and he also had at least a part – either by publicly talking about him or showing what Vanderbilt football is capable of – of landing five-star quarterback Jared Curtis, who flipped from Georgia around National Signing Day.\n\nHe’s thrown for 2,924 yards with 26 touchdowns and six picks this season and also leads the Commodores with 661 rushing yards and eight TDs.\n\nRanked as the fifth-best running back in the 2023 class, Love chose Notre Dame over Alabama, Michigan, Texas A&M, Oregon and others midway through his senior season.\n\nAt the time of his pledge, the Irish also had running back pledges from Dylan Edwards, who has had a wild recruitment and college career of changing schools, along with Jayden Limar.\n\nThe Christian Brothers standout was the second St. Louis standout who was in that Notre Dame class along with four-star DB Christian Gray who played at De Smet.\n\nLove has rushed for more than 1,000 yards in each of the last two seasons and would be the first running back to win the Heisman Trophy since Derrick Henry in 2015. The former four-star has rushed for 1,372 yards and 18 touchdowns this season and those will be his final stats since the Irish turned down a bowl game bid.",

    "title": "A Rivian spin-off is betting $305 million on e-bikes. I rode it around New York City, and it felt natural — and powerful.",
    "description": "I use my steel Fuji road bike for everything. So when I heard about a new e-bike from Rivian spin-off Also, I couldn't resist trying it out.",
    "fullText": "Many Americans view cars as a necessity. But for me, and millions of other people, bikes are how we get where we need to go.\n\nMy steel Fuji road bike is like another limb. I use it to get to work, grab groceries, and pedal to see my friends. I can haul it onto the subway if I get tired, or if the weather takes a surprise turn for the worse. It's cheap to maintain, and I can use it in place of a gym membership.\n\nIn New York City, where I live, e-bikes — the road bike's zoomier cousin — are everywhere. They're not just popular with the 135,000 members of Citibike, our city's bike-share program; businesses have also embraced them. Many delivery workers use e-bikes to avoid our city's awful traffic snarls, and giants like Amazon use them to drop off packages and reduce emissions.\n\nSo when one of my colleagues told me they'd been getting emails from Also, a new e-bike company, I couldn't resist hopping in the saddle. I've been thinking about buying an e-bike, and the emails said Also's bike, the TM-B, had some unique features. The fact that it had been spun out of Rivian, a $21 billion electric vehicle company, intrigued me.\n\nRivian has retained a minority stake in Also — as in, \"you can drive a car, and you can also ride a bike.\" Also uses the same battery cells as Rivian's autos, and takes inspiration from the carmaker's drive for simplicity. While many e-bikes are manufactured by traditional bike makers, Also sticks exclusively with electric-powered products. It has raised $305 million, according to Pitchbook.\n\nJust before Thanksgiving, I met up with Saul Leiken, Also's director of product, to learn about the new $4,500 TM-B and take it for a spin around Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood.\n\nI came away surprised at how flexible it was, and thinking it could be a good add-on — or primary method of transportation — for many households across the US.\n\nAll e-bikes are complex pieces of machinery compared to normal bikes. In pedal-assist modes — when the motor only kicks in when you turn the pedals — the bike needs some way to process and interpret how hard you're pedaling to decide how much to help you. Those sensors need to be able to \"talk\" to the motor.\n\nThe TM-B, which stands for \"Transcendant Mobility Bike,\" operates on an entirely different level from your typical e-bike. The pedals don't connect to a chain; they power a generator and provide input to a computer system that tells the motor how much juice to give the bike, a system the company calls \"DreamRide.\" If there are updates, they'll be delivered over-the-air, like with your smartphone — or, increasingly, your car.\n\n\"Everything's software-defined,\" said Leiken, who also joined me on a test ride.\n\nIt struck me how digitized everyday transportation is becoming. Even gas-burning cars don't have direct, mechanical links between the steering wheel and the wheels or even the gas pedal and the engine. It's all digital, or \"drive by wire.\" That makes the TM-B \"pedal by wire.\"\n\nI started out riding the TM-B in \"All Purpose\" mode. I relied on pedal assist, and I changed the levels by tapping a small screen at the top of the bike's head tube. It didn't feel like I was giving instructions to a computer; it felt like I was pedaling.\n\nThe part of Manhattan we were riding in was pretty flat, and it was a somewhat chilly day. Even if I'd been using a normal bike, I probably would not have broken a sweat. But the assist from the DreamRide would be welcome on a warmer day, and I could see it propelling me over the Manhattan Bridge if I wanted to get to Brooklyn without much effort.\n\nLater on, we tried the TM-B's \"Sport\" mode, which approximates the experience of a standard, geared bicycle. There's no chain to clank around to let you know you've switched gears, but there is haptic feedback, just like on your smartphone, that courses through the pedals.\n\nState and local e-bike regulations are evolving, but in most states, there are three classes of e-bike, and the TM-B is what's called a \"Class 3\" e-bike, capable of hitting speeds up to 28 miles per hour. That's about as fast as a car will ever go in most places in New York City, except for a highway or a boulevard in one of the outer boroughs — in the middle of the night.\n\nI inched toward that top speed at a couple of points during our 30-minute ride. Once, early on, I cranked the pedal-assist level to its max. I was only going in the mid-20s, but still beating traffic because bikes are simply more nimble than cars, until we hit a red light.\n\nLater, when we were going west along a large block, I remembered to hit the throttle — a little orange button near my right thumb designed to take me up to 20 miles per hour.\n\nIt gave me a real rush; it felt almost like riding a motorbike, which I hadn't done in years. At the same time, I knew I had to be attentive, for my own safety and that of others.\n\nNationwide, estimated e-bike sales are between 1 million and 2 million a year. It's hard to be precise, partly because the market has so many players, and partly because customs data is incomplete and lumps e-bikes into a larger category of imports, according to eCycle Electric, a consulting firm. What's clear is that it's growing: eCycle predicts that sales will grow 14% to 25% per year until 2030.\n\nSome e-bike companies have run into trouble. Recently, Techcrunch reported that Rad Power Bikes, which says it has 680,000 customers, could run out of money by January 2026. VanMoof, a Dutch e-bike brand whose sleek rides stood apart from competitors with chunky batteries and conspicuous wiring, went bankrupt in 2023, and its new owners are trying to reestablish themselves.\n\nWhen I asked Leiken about this, he said Also's timing was better — some e-bike companies built too much during the pandemic and were desperate to unload inventory afterward — and its business model is less reliant on partners. The bike's adaptability struck me as a potential selling point, too: It can ride on roads, rutted streets, and trails, and can be used for a workout or a quick errand.\n\nSome things about the bike weren't final. The bell is digital, emitted by a speaker, and Leiken told me they were considering tweaking the tone and modifying it so that, if you hit it hard, it would sound like a car horn. It reminded me of how electric car manufacturers have created custom sounds to alert pedestrians at low speeds, as required by federal regulations.\n\nAlso has also rolled out a helmet, called the Alpha Wave. It has built-in front and rear lights meant to catch drivers' attention, speakers, and a noise-cancelling mic. While simple bike helmets provide some degree of protection in case of a collision, Also's helmet has a new technology called the Release Layer System that's meant to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury.\n\nThere's a learning curve to bike ownership, and Also seems focused on flattening that curve.\n\nWhile I didn't have the controls down pat in a roughly 30-minute ride, I felt completely safe the whole time, and I'm sure I would've gotten the hang of it in another hour. For a novice rider, it might take longer, and it would be smart to start in a park or a parking lot before mixing with traffic.\n\nOne of the more intriguing aspects of the bike was its swappable \"top frames.\" With a couple of taps, you can replace the seat with one for a much larger or much smaller rider. You can also swap in a roomier bench seat, or a seat with a utility rack to schlep cargo or a kid. It slots in like a ski boot, with a mechanical lock and an electrical connection to power the back lights on the bike. I'm not aware of any e-bikes with a similar feature.\n\nThe point of the TM-B wasn't just to create a fun ride, Leiken said. It was to further the idea of \"bikes as transportation\" — as something that can actually replace a car for local trips. While $3,500 is nothing to sneeze at, Leiken said the company wanted to bring a \"super-premium feature set and experience\" to riders. He said bikes with similar features are usually more like $8,000. Besides, a used car will set you back $25,000 on average, and an average new car is $50,000.\n\nI've long thought that e-bikes are generally good to have in society, and that they could replace a great deal of car trips. I've occasionally mulled buying one, but I feel like, as a fit person in my 30s, it might be overkill.\n\nThe TM-B didn't radically change my mind. I'm still undecided on buying an e-bike — I really love my Fuji road bike — but it could be good for someone who wants an e-bike that can do it all. It's a flexible workhorse, and given how pricey cars are getting, I think a lot of people could justify the price tag.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Moments after Luigi Mangione was handcuffed at a Pennsylvania McDonald’s, a police officer searching his backpack found a loaded gun magazine wrapped in a pair of underwear.\n\nThe discovery, recounted in court Monday as Mangione fights to keep evidence out of his New York murder case, convinced police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, that he was the man wanted in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan five days earlier.\n\n“It's him, dude. It's him, 100%,” an officer was heard saying on body-worn camera video from Mangione’s Dec. 9, 2024 arrest, punctuating the remark with expletives as the officer combing the bag, Christy Wasser, held up the magazine.\n\nWasser, a 19-year Altoona police veteran, testified on the fourth day of a pretrial hearing as Mangione sought to bar prosecutors from using the magazine and other evidence against him, including a 9 mm handgun and a notebook found during a subsequent bag search.\n\nThe testimony shed light on the critical minutes after Mangione was spotted at the McDonald’s and the sometimes unusual steps police officers took in collecting evidence critical to tying him to the crime.\n\nWhy the defense says the evidence shouldn't be used at trial\n\nMangione’s lawyers argue the items should be excluded because police didn’t have a search warrant and lacked the grounds to justify a warrantless search. Prosecutors contend the search was legal and that police eventually obtained a warrant.\n\nWasser, testifying in full uniform, said Altoona police protocols require promptly searching a suspect’s property at the time of an arrest, in part for dangerous items.\n\nOn body-worn camera video played in court, Wasser was heard saying she wanted to check the bag for bombs before removing it from the McDonald’s. Despite that concern, she acknowledged in her testimony Monday that police never cleared the restaurant of customers or employees.\n\nMangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. He appeared in good health on Monday, pumping his fist for photographers and chatting with his lawyers as testimony resumed.\n\nThe hearing, which was postponed Friday because of Mangione’s apparent illness, applies only to the state case. His lawyers are making a similar push to exclude the evidence from his federal case, where prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.\n\nWhy prosecutors say jurors should be able to see the evidence\n\nProsecutors have said the handgun found in the backpack matches the firearm used in the killing and that writings in the notebook showed Mangione’s disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference.\n\nThompson, 50, was killed as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for his company’s investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.\n\nMangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west of Manhattan, after police there received a 911 call about a McDonald’s customer resembling the suspect.\n\nWasser testified that she went to the McDonald’s on her own to assist another officer, Joseph Detwiler. Before that, she said, she had seen some coverage of Thompson’s killing on Fox News, including the surveillance video of the shooting and images of the suspected shooter.\n\nWasser began searching Mangione’s bag as officers took him into custody on initial charges of forgery and false identification, after he acknowledged giving them a bogus driving license, police said. The same fake name was used by the alleged gunman used at a Manhattan hostel days before the shooting.\n\nWasser told another officer she wanted to check the bag for a bomb before leaving the McDonald’s because she didn’t want to repeat an incident in which another Altoona officer had inadvertently brought a bomb to the police station.\n\nWhat did police find in Mangione's bag?\n\n“Did you call the bomb squad?” Mangione lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo asked.\n\n“No. I didn’t find a bomb yet,” Wasser responded.\n\nAccording to body-worn camera video, the first few items Wasser found were innocuous: a hoagie, a loaf of bread and a smaller bag containing a passport, cellphone and computer chip.\n\nThen she pulled out a gray pair of underwear, unwrapping them to reveal the magazine.\n\nSatisfied there was no bomb, she suspended her search and placed some of the items back in the bag. Some evidence, including Mangione’s laptop computer, was transported to the police station in a brown paper McDonald’s takeout bag, body-worn camera video showed.\n\nWasser resumed her search after an 11-minute drive to the police station and almost immediately found the gun and silencer — the latter discovery prompting her to laugh and exclaim “nice,” according to body-worn camera footage. Wasser said the gun was in a side pocket that she hadn't searched at McDonald’s.\n\nLater, while cataloging everything in the bag in what's known as an inventory search, she found the notebook and other notes, including what appeared to to-do lists and possible getaway plans.\n\n“Isn't it awesome?” Wasser said at one point during the search, according to the body-worn camera video.\n\nAsked to explain, she told Friedman Agnifilo on Monday that she was proud of her police department’s work in helping to capture Thompson’s suspected killer.\n\nA Blair County, Pennsylvania, prosecutor testified that a judge later signed off on a search warrant for the bag, a few hours after the searches were completed. The warrant, she said, provided a legal mechanism for Altoona police to turn the evidence over to New York City detectives investigating Thompson’s killing.\n\nAs he has throughout the case, Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann described Thompson’s killing as an “execution” and referred to his notebook as a “manifesto” — terms that Mangione’s lawyers said were prejudicial and inappropriate.\n\nJudge Gregory Carro said the wording had “no bearing” on him, but warned Seidemann that he’s “certainly not going to do that at trial” when jurors are present.",

    "fullText": "The first two officers arriving at the McDonald's on December 9, 2024 — the fifth day of the nationwide manhunt — had not been expecting much.\n\nNo one believed Thompson's shooter would be in the restaurant — not the two cops, not their supervisor, not even the store manager who'd reluctantly called 911 at their customers' insistence. The call had been dispatched as \"Priority: Low.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\" one of the officers asked, approaching Mangione at the back of the restaurant. \"Uh, Mark,\" Mangione answered, according to sealed police bodycam footage shown in court. He told them he was homeless.\n\nHe then handed over this New Jersey license — listing his name as \"Mark Rosario.\"\n\nMangione was then asked to pull down his blue-and-white paper medical mask, which Altoona patrolman Joseph Detwiler said made Mangioni stand out.\n\n\"We don't wear masks,\" Detwiler told the jury. \"We have antibodies.\"\n\nWhen Mangione's mask was lowered, everything changed. \"I knew it was him immediately,\" testified Detwiler. \"I stayed calm.\"\n\nBodycam footage showed the officer whistling along as Jingle Bell Rock played on the McDonald's sound system — to keep Mangione calm as well, as they ran his license, he told the judge.\n\nDetwiler had closely followed the manhunt for Thompson's killer, the veteran patrolman told New York Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro from the witness stand.\n\nHe'd said he'd seen NYPD social media postings publicizing the as-yet-unnamed shooting suspect's face. Elsewhere online, he had seen surveillance footage of the shooting, which was played in court.\n\n\"I knew in New York that they hadn't found the firearm,\" Detwiler testified. Safety, he explained, was behind the decision to frisk Mangione and search his backpack before arresting him on the initial Pennsylvania charges of forgery and providing a false ID to law enforcement.\n\nOnce at the Altoona Police station, a more thorough search of Mangione's backpack, pockets, clothing, and other belongings was conducted. Officers found this folded scrap of lined paper, filled with writing and diagrams in pencil.\n\nPart doodled map, part to-do list, it is filled with dates and tasks, only some of which were accomplished. Under \"12/8,\" the words \"Best buy\" had been crossed off, as were mentions of a USB drive, \"digital cam,\" and \"light source.\"\n\n\"Hot meal\" and \"water bottles\" were also crossed off.\n\nOther items on the list — including \"AAA bats\" and \"survival kit,\" under the date 12/9, the day of his arrest — were not crossed out.\n\nAt the Altoona police station, cops recovered $7,800 in large bills and currency from Thailand, Japan, and India, totaling $1,620, from Mangioni's backpack. \n\n\"There's a weapon,\" Patrolwoman Christy Wasser is heard saying soon after, in footage showing her continuing to search Mangione's backpack.\n\nGiven the gun and the at-first-overlooked knife, the decision was made to strip-search Mangione.",
