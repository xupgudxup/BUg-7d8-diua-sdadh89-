    "fullText": "A man who lived in the iconic New Yorker Hotel for half a decade without paying a single cent in rent has been sentenced to jail.\n\nPolice arrested Mickey Barreto in February 2024 and charged him with filing fraudulent property records after he attempted to claim ownership of the hotel, the Manhattan district attorney's office said.\n\nProsecutors said Barreto skirted thousands of dollars worth of rent payments by exploiting a little-known local housing law, and then attempted to charge another tenant in the building rent.\n\n“As alleged, Mickey Barreto repeatedly and fraudulently claimed ownership of one of the City’s most iconic landmarks, the New Yorker Hotel,” Alvin Bragg, Manhattan's district attorney, said in a statement in 2024.\n\nBarreto faced 24 charges, including 14 felony fraud counts, The New York Times reported. In February 2026, he pled guilty to a felony count of filing a false instrument and was sentenced to six months in jail and five years of post-release probation.\n\nBarreto's residency at the renowned hotel — which in its heyday hosted many dignitaries and celebrities, including Muhammad Ali and John F. Kennedy — dates back to 2018 when he first learned about New York City's Rent Stabilization Code. This law grants tenants living in individual rooms in buildings built before 1969 the right to request a six-month lease.\n\nIn June 2018, Barreto checked into room 2565 with his partner, Matthew Hannan, for one night and was charged $200.57.\n\nThe following day, Barreto requested a six-month lease from the hotel and was promptly evicted.\n\nBarreto — a California transplant with a penchant for conspiracy theories who also claims to be the leader of a tribal community he founded in Brazil, according to The New York Times — refused to take no for an answer.\n\nThat July, he took the building's owner, the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity, to housing court, claiming he was illegally evicted. A representative for the church didn't show up, so the judge sided with Barreto, and the hotel had to give him the key.\n\nThe two parties never agreed on lease terms, and because he couldn't be evicted, Barreto lived at the hotel rent-free.\n\nSoon, Barreto began portraying himself as the hotel's owner and eventually demanded rent from one of the building's tenants, the TickTock diner.\n\nThe DA's office said that Barreto also registered the hotel under his name with the city's Department of Environmental Protection as part of an effort to gain control of the hotel’s bank accounts.\n\nThe Unification Church, which bought the New Yorker in 1976, sued Barreto for representing himself as the hotel's owner on LinkedIn and uploading a forged deed to a city website. Barreto was ordered by a judge to stop asserting that he owned the building, but he continued to live there.\n\nIn 2023, Barreto again filed papers with the city claiming to be the building's owner, and that's when the district attorney's office stepped in.\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to Barreto through his company, Mickey Barreto Missions, in 2024, but didn't receive a response before publication.\n\n“I never intended to commit any fraud. I don’t believe I ever committed any fraud,” Barreto told The Associated Press. “And I never made a penny out of this.”\n\nWhen asked for a comment by Business Insider, the New York City Police Department directed questions to the district attorney's office.\n\nCorrection: April 12, 2024 — An earlier version of this story misstated details about the legal claims filed by Barreto and the building's owner. Barreto initially took the building owner to housing court for being illegally evicted, and a judge sided with him because a representative for the owner did not appear in court. That case did not go before the state Supreme Court and there was no appeal filed. The story has also been updated to clarify some details about the chronology of the legal disputes between the two parties.",

    "fullText": "American Rare Earths CEO Mark Wall joined Steve Darling from Proactive’s OTC studio in New York City to discuss the strategic importance and long-term potential of the Halleck Creek rare earths project in Wyoming, positioning it as a cornerstone for domestic U.S. supply.\n\nWall described the project’s scale as extraordinary, noting, “It’s 2.5 billion tons of ore, with a B, which is a lot.” He compared Halleck Creek to large, long-life copper porphyry systems, highlighting its low strip ratio of 0.16 and near-surface mineralisation, making it “very, very simple to mine.” He emphasised that the asset has the potential to act as “the strategic anchor to United States rare earths supply domestically for many, many, many years.”\n\nCurrent estimates suggest around 100 years of supply, though Wall noted this is a conservative figure. At a lower cut-off grade of 1,000 ppm, the resource could extend beyond 400 years, with the ore body remaining open both at depth and laterally.\n\nLooking ahead to 2026, the company plans several key milestones, including completion of the pre-feasibility study (PFS), commencement of the feasibility study, submission of the state permit, and ongoing engagement in Washington, DC to reinforce the project’s strategic significance.\n\nHalleck Creek hosts both heavy and light rare earths, including terbium, dysprosium, and samarium, elements critical for defence and advanced technology applications. Combined with Wyoming’s supportive infrastructure, permitting framework, and collaboration with the University of Wyoming on potential industrial uses for engineered sand by-products, Wall positioned Halleck Creek as a major domestic rare earth opportunity that could strengthen U.S. supply chain independence.\n\n#proactiveinvestors #americanrareearths #asx #arr #otcqx #arrnf #HalleckCreek #RareEarths #USMining #WyomingMining #CriticalMinerals #HeavyRareEarths #LightRareEarths #EnergyTransition #DefenseMetals #MiningInvestment #StrategicMetals #PFS #FeasibilityStudy #USSupplyChain",

    "fullText": "The death of a nearly blind refugee in Buffalo, New York, days after Border Patrol agents dropped him off at a coffee shop alone, has prompted an investigation into the circumstances of his final days and drawn sharp criticism from the mayor, who called the incident “deeply disturbing.”\n\nNurul Amin Shah Alam, 56, who spoke little English, had been missing since February 19, when the agents left him at the shop shortly after he was released from the Erie County jail, officials said. His body was found five days later, around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, about four miles from the coffee shop, the Buffalo Police Department said.\n\n“Homicide detectives are investigating the circumstances and timeframe of events leading up to his death, following his release from custody,” the police department said in a statement.\n\nThe Erie County Medical Examiner conducted an autopsy and determined Shah Alam’s cause of death was health‑related. Exposure and homicide have been ruled out, Buffalo city spokesperson Nick Beiling said.\n\n“A vulnerable man – nearly blind and unable to speak English – was left alone on a cold winter night with no known attempt to leave him in a safe, secure location. That decision from US Customs and Border Protection was unprofessional and inhumane,” Buffalo Mayor Sean Ryan said Wednesday, calling Shah Alam’s death “preventable,” and insisting CBP “answer for how and why this happened.”\n\nShah Alam, a refugee from Myanmar, had spent much of the previous year in custody awaiting trial on criminal charges that were ultimately resolved with a misdemeanor plea deal, according to Reuters.\n\nAs Shah Alam’s discharge from jail was being processed, deputies notified US Border Patrol, which had earlier placed him under an immigration detainer, the Erie County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.\n\n“U.S. Border Patrol arrived at the Holding Center prior to the finalization of Mr. Shah Alam’s release from Erie County Sheriff’s Office custody,” the statement said.\n\nA spokesperson for CBP said the agents later determined Shah Alam had entered the United States as a refugee on December 24, 2024, and “was not amenable to removal.”\n\n“Border Patrol agents offered him a courtesy ride, which he chose to accept to a coffee shop, determined to be a warm, safe location near his last known address, rather than be released directly from the Border Patrol station,” the statement said. “He showed no signs of distress, mobility issues or disabilities requiring special assistance.”\n\nShah Alam’s February 2025 arrest stemmed from what one of his children described to Reuters as a misunderstanding with police.\n\nShah Alam had been out for a walk and was using a curtain rod as a walking stick when he got lost and wandered onto private property, his son Mohamad Faisal said. When he did not understand officers’ commands to drop the rod, Shah Alam was arrested.\n\nA police report obtained by CNN affiliate WGRZ showed Shah Alam was being held on two counts of assault with intent to cause injury to an officer, a count of possession of a weapon and trespassing, among other charges, before a plea deal was reached.\n\nCNN reached out to the Erie County District Attorney’s Office for additional information.\n\n“Nobody told me or my family or attorney where my dad was dropped off,” Faisal told Reuters of his father’s release, adding that his father did not read, write or use electronic devices.\n\nThe family are Arakan Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, he said, referring to the stateless Muslim minority from Myanmar’s Rakhine state. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled the war-torn country since late 2016 following a brutal crackdown by the military junta that the US has since declared a genocide.\n\nShah Alam only wanted to “eat home-cooked food” and “be united with the rest of (his) family,” Faisal told Reuters.",

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees have added a familiar face to their spring training roster, agreeing to a minor-league contract with veteran outfielder Randal Grichuk that includes a non-roster invitation to Major League camp as the club continues shaping its 2026 roster. At 34, Grichuk brings a right-handed bat and power potential to a Yankees squad that has been searching for lineup balance, particularly against left-handed pitching. His signing comes as part of New York’s efforts to address its bench depth and find options who can impact games in platoon roles or come off the bench when needed.\n\nGrichuk, originally a first-round draft pick (seventh overall in 2012), enters the Yankees’ camp with over a decade of MLB experience. Over his career with multiple clubs, including the St. Louis Cardinals, Toronto Blue Jays, and most recently the Kansas City Royals and Arizona Diamondbacks, he has amassed more than 200 home runs and established himself as a reliable corner outfielder with pop in his bat.\n\nThough his 2025 season was below his career averages, he slashed .228/.273/.401 between Arizona and Kansas City, teams value Grichuk’s experience and ability to contribute in the right situations.\n\nNew York’s lineup for 2026 is loaded with left-handed hitters, and adding a right-handed bat like Grichuk helps balance the roster, especially against tough southpaw starters. Yankees executives have openly stated their interest in right-handed offensive options this offseason, and Grichuk fits that need without requiring a guaranteed major-league contract.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Grichuk will compete with other outfielders during Spring Training for a roster spot. If he performs well, he could find himself on the Opening Day roster as a platoon option or a depth piece off the bench.\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nOLYMPICS: Most talked-about Olympic romances from 2026 Winter Games\n\nNBA: Andrew Friedman, other Dodgers execs get new roles with Lakers after $10 billion sale\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: USA men’s hockey draws record Olympic gold medal TV viewership\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Martin Short’s daughter Katherine tragically dies at age 42\n\nVIRAL: Pat McAfee makes stunning gesture during Team USA’s $150K Gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Yankees sign veteran outfielder and former first round pick appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration is blocking Venezuela's government from paying for the cost of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro's defense against drug trafficking charges in New York, a move that potentially interferes with his constitutional right to counsel, his lawyer says.\n\nAttorney Barry Pollack told a Manhattan federal judge in an email last week that the U.S. Treasury Department had blocked the authorization of legal fees that the government of Venezuela is required to pay for Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores under its law and custom. The email was entered into the public court record on Wednesday.\n\nMaduro and his wife have been jailed in New York without bail since they were seized from their Venezuelan home Jan. 3 in a stealth nighttime raid by U.S. military forces. They have both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe stunning capture following a monthslong military buildup in the Caribbean has paved the way for the Trump administration to assert enormous influence over Maduro's replacement, his vice president and now acting President Delcy Rodriguez. Under pressure from the U.S., Rodriguez has moved swiftly to open up Venezuela's oil industry to American investment, free political prisoners and reestablish direct communications with Washington — something unseen since the first Trump administration shuttered the U.S. embassy in Caracas in 2019.\n\nIn the email, Pollack said that the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers sanctions against Venezuela, had granted permission on Jan. 9 approving the payment of legal fees by the Venezuelan government.\n\nLess than three hours later, though, the Trump administration snatched back the authorization “without explanation,” though it left in place a license granting permission for Maduro's wife's lawyers to be paid, Pollack said.\n\nThe dispute over Maduro’s legal fees is intimately linked to U.S. foreign policy. The first Trump administration cut ties with Maduro in 2019, recognizing the then opposition head of the National Assembly as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. The Biden administration hewed closely to the same policy.\n\nHowever, allowing Rodriguez’s government to pay for the cost of Maduro’s defense could complicate prosecutors' efforts in court to counter the deposed leader’s argument that his capture was illegal and that as the foreign head of a state he is immune from prosecution under U.S. and international law.\n\nA 25-page indictment against Maduro accused him and others of working with drug cartels and members of the military to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S. Both he and his wife face life in prison if convicted.\n\nAs part of the purported conspiracy, Maduro and his wife allegedly ordering kidnappings, beatings and murders of those who owed them drug money, according to the indictment. It said that included the killing of a local drug boss in Caracas.\n\nMessages seeking comment from the Treasury Department, White House and the Justice Department were not immediately returned.\n\nPollack said he asked the Office of Foreign Assets Control on Feb. 11 to reinstate the original license and clear the way for Venezuela to meet its obligation to pay Maduro's defense costs.\n\nThe lawyer added that Maduro “cannot otherwise afford counsel\" and will request help from the judge to pay for his defense.\n\nPollack said the United States was “interfering with Mr. Maduro's ability to retain counsel and, therefore, his right under the Sixth Amendment to counsel of his choice.”\n\nGoodman reported from Miami. Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani and Fatima Hussein in Washington and Larry Neumeister in New York contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Macie Strum felt relief the second time she got laid off. She subletted her apartment and planned what she thought would be an 8-month trip abroad.",
    "fullText": "I thought I was on track — until the year everything fell apart.\n\nJust weeks into January 2023, I was blindsided by an unexpected breakup. In the months that followed, I moved through my days on autopilot, watching the year continue to unravel.\n\nThat May, I was laid off from my job coordinating large conferences and corporate travel. I took a position at a family-run wedding business that was building out its travel department. I told myself things were starting to look up.\n\nBut between a 90-minute commute, sitting at a desk all day, and performing mundane tasks not listed in my job description, I began to spiral instead of heal.\n\nAlmost every day, I'd retreat to my car at lunchtime and break down in tears, overwhelmed by how unhappy I was.\n\nSince I was a kid, I'd treated success like a checklist built from American expectations I absorbed through school, TV, and social media. It seemed simple enough: Stay in line with peers, get married before turning 30, and buy a big house to raise a family in.\n\nIt was becoming clear that this narrative might not align with the life I wanted for myself.\n\nLater that same year, I dealt with a toxic roommate, a serious health scare in my family, and a car accident. Then, just days before the New Year, I got one final surprise: another layoff. This time, however, I felt relief.\n\nWalking out of that office for the last time allowed me to stop chasing a version of success I knew would never satisfy me.\n\nAs 2024 began, I set a clear goal for myself to sublet my apartment, sell my belongings, and board a one-way flight to South Korea by April 15. My plan was to begin an eight-month journey across Asia and Australia. After four months of careful planning, I boarded that flight.\n\nStarting the trip with a friend in Seoul made the beginning — and the 15-hour flight over — feel safe and manageable. When she boarded her flight back to the US, and I headed off to Thailand alone, that distraction disappeared. I was officially left alone with my own thoughts.\n\nEarly on in Southeast Asia, I questioned what I was doing and where it would all lead. I cried in hostels and had panic attacks on the back of motorbikes. My anxiety was triggered by the blasting music of Bangkok's Khao San Road and Ho Chi Minh City's endless traffic.\n\nThe more I took note of my surroundings, the less the world around me matched the urgency in my head.\n\nAs I traveled the Ha Giang Loop in Northern Vietnam by motorbike, I realized that my idea of success was built upon a level of pressure that didn't exist up in these Vietnamese mountains. Local life didn't revolve around strict deadlines and productivity scales. Instead, it centered on routine, family, and staying present each day.\n\nAs I moved through each country, I connected with travelers of every age and background, many of whom were unemployed, exploring new paths, working online, or simply figuring things out as they went. Some were meticulous planners; others lived day to day.\n\nIn the jungles of Malaysian Borneo, I met a fellow American who was also redefining her life after a heavy breakup. I remember the first night we met, we talked for hours about life, expectations, and the fear of what would come next.\n\nWe ended up traveling together to Kuala Lumpur, meeting again in Penang, and later in Bali. Seeing her in so many different places reminded me how many others were navigating the same uncertainty.\n\nIt reframed my view of travel — not as a break from real life, but as an active part of it. For the first time, uncertainty no longer felt like failure.\n\nWhen that trip came to an end, I felt no pull toward the life I'd left the year before.\n\nI returned to the US briefly, but chose to keep traveling to explore what alternative versions of success could look like for me.\n\nIn 2025, that decision took me to 17 European countries. As I explored, I found myself falling in love with one of the continent's most misunderstood regions: the Balkans.\n\nToday, I live in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, building a career as a freelance journalist without sacrificing my ability to travel. While the life I'm creating may not match the version of success I was raised with, it's more aligned with how I want to live: flexibly, deliberately, and with purpose.\n\nWhile I don't know exactly what comes next, that no longer scares me the way it once did.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad?

    "fullText": "The New York high school boys basketball 2025-26 campaign is closing in on the postseason.\n\nFor most of the New York high school boys basketball season, remaining at the top of the weekly rankings are the Archbishop Stepinac Crusaders, which are currently 22-4 on the season and are currently riding a 16-game winning streak. Besides the unstoppable Crusaders, but who else should we watch for out of New York when it comes to the state’s top high school boys basketball squads?\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory.\n\nHere’s a way-too-early look at the top 25 teams in the country according to the Massey Ratings, which ranks teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule and margin of victory, as of Feb. 25.\n\nThe Archbishop Stepinac Crusaders (22-4) haven’t lost a game since Dec. 27 to Montverde Academy (Fla.). This season, the Crusaders senior-laden bunch has led the way and shown off their talent in the front and back court. Senior four-star shooting guard Jasiah Jervis returns after averaging a team-high 16.2 points per game last season. The Crusaders will be tough to drive to the rim on as they have a pair of USC commits in 7-footers in Adonis and Darius Ratliff, respectively. Fordham commitment Hassan Koureissi pairs up with Jervis to create one of the best guard combos in the Northeast. The Crusaders last week notched a pair of blowout wins over Msgr Scanlan and Cardinal Hayes, which the latter was for the 2026 New York Diocesan Championship.\n\nThe Long Island Lutheran Crusaders (8-10) have been below the .500 mark the last few weeks, but have played some of the top competition in the country. What is obvious when taking a look at the talent pool the Crusaders possesses, this team can compete with practically anyone in the nation. Long Island Lutheran has multiple five-star talents in senior 6-foot-5 point guard Dylan Mingo and junior 6-foot-8 forward Moussa Kamissoko. Among other players folks need to have their eyes on that lace ’em up for the Crusaders are Cincinnati commitment Kayden Allen and North Texas pledge TJ Crumble. Long Island Lutheran lost a 66-63 heartbreaker to Brewster Academy (NH), but bounced back with a 57-50 win over Oak Hill Academy.\n\nThe Cardinal Hayes Cardinals (17-7) recently saw their three-game winning streak snapped against Holy Cross in a 67-52 decision. The Cardinals most impressive win of the season came against Iona Preparatory School in a 80-74 decision. The Cardinals saw their season come to an end in a 67-51 loss to Archbishop Stepinac for the 2026 New York Diocesan Championship.\n\nThe St. Francis Preparatory School Terriers (18-5) have continued with their winning ways as they return one of the more talented teams in the New York City region. Key players returning for the Terriers begins with Oesoemana Sacko, who is already committed to Fairfield University, and 6-foot-3 sophomore Justin DeSena. The Terriers’ only five losses on the season have come against Colorado’s No. 1 ranked Ralston Valley, No. 3 Christ The King Regional (twice), No. 6 Nazareth and No. 22 Msgr Scanlan, respectively. St. Francis Preparatory most recent game was a 101-98 loss to Christ The King Regional.\n\nThe Nazareth Kingsmen (17-8) of Brooklyn remains in the Top 5 of our latest New York high school boys basketball rankings, though their season came to an end last week in a loss to Holy Cross. Of Nazareth’s eight losses this season, two of them have come against Archbishop Molloy, but the Kingsmen were able to notch their first victory versus the Stanners. The Kingsmen recently notched an impressive 67-52 victory over No. 3 St. Francis Prep.\n\n6. Christ The King Regional Lions (14-10) \n7. Christian Brothers Academy Brothers (18-0)\n8. Westhill Warriors (17-2)\n9. Thomas Jefferson Campus Orange Wave (14-7)\n10. Iona Preparatory School Gaels (16-10) \n\n11. Albany Academy Cadets (3-1)\n12. St. Raymond For Boys Ravens (11-15)\n12. Fairport Red Raiders (17-1) \n14. Penfield Senior Patriots (15-1)\n15. Chaminade Flyers (15-4)\n\n16. St. John’s Prep Red Storm (16-2) \n17. Holy Trinity Diocesan Titans (16-3)\n18. Archbishop Molloy Stanners (14-12)\n19. Mamaroneck Tigers (15-3)\n20. Canarsie Wolfpack (14-5)\n\n21. Msgr Scanlan Crusaders (11-12)\n22. Columbia Grammar-prep School (9-0)\n23. Shaker Bison (15-4) \n24. Holy Cross Knights (11-17)\n25. Green Tech Charter Eagles (17-1)",

    "title": "An NYC couple went from 'autopilot' to financial independence. They share 3 money moves they made.",
    "description": "Financial independence for Josette Chang and Alexander Nathanson came from strategic planning, smart investing, and eliminating mortgage debt.",
    "fullText": "For years, Josette Chang and Alexander Nathanson were doing all the \"right\" things with their money — maxing out retirement accounts, saving consistently, and earning high incomes in finance and medicine — but they didn't have a clear plan.\n\n\"We were kind of on autopilot,\" Nathanson told Business Insider. \"The internet says, 'Max out your 401(k).' We did that, but we didn't really think much beyond that.\"\n\nWithin a year of investing in a financial planner and reevaluating their strategy, the New York City couple were surprised to learn that they had already reached financial independence. Chang quit her finance job in 2024, and Nathanson, a physician specializing in obesity medicine, scaled back his hospital hours. He doesn't work because he has to, but because he wants to.\n\n\"We have to acknowledge our privilege. We're two high-income professionals, but even then, I still feel like more people can do it than may realize it,\" Nathanson said.\n\nHere are the three money moves they say set them up for early retirement.\n\nNathanson and Chang weren't financial novices. Chang worked in finance, and Nathanson regularly read about investing\n\n\"I thought that I knew what I was doing,\" Nathanson said. \"Turns out when you speak with a knowledgeable third party, it really can change things profoundly.\"\n\nThat's ultimately what they decided to do, even though they were initially wary of hiring a professional. Like many high earners, they were skeptical of the traditional assets-under-management model, where advisors earn more as portfolios grow.\n\nThe couple chose to work with a flat-fee planner, Dr. Jay Zigmont, who specializes in advising people without children. One of the first things he did was challenge how they were thinking about financial independence.\n\n\"We assumed early retirement required building a portfolio of rental properties: You need rental properties, and you need a lot of them,\" said Nathanson, noting that he and Chang never wanted to be landlords. \"Working with Jay shed some of those misconceptions. It allowed us to prioritize what we actually want to do and what we don't want to do.\"\n\nBeyond reframing their mindset, their planner also put structure behind their numbers. When you're after financial independence, figuring out how much is \"enough\" to quit or scale back from work isn't a simple calculation and involves factoring in things like how much your money will compound, long-term care, and withdrawal strategies.\n\n\"It's an important calculation. It's not necessarily simple,\" said Nathanson. \"I don't think anyone could just sit down and do it themselves, but once all of that is done, I would say that more people are further along than they think.\"\n\nAnother key shift was how they handled their savings. Before hiring a professional, they had parked a significant amount of money in a high-yield savings account while debating whether to upgrade to a larger home.\n\nOnce they decided to stay put, they realized that cash could be working harder for them in an investment account.\n\nToday, their portfolio is intentionally simple, consisting of three low-cost index funds: a total US stock market fund, a total international stock market fund, and a total bond market fund.\n\n\"We believe in an evidence-based investment strategy,\" Chang said, adding that they deliberately avoid more speculative investments, such as individual stock picking and cryptocurrency.\n\nThe third move ran counter to common financial advice. Conventional wisdom often suggests keeping a low-interest mortgage and investing the extra cash instead. When they bought their New York City apartment in 2018, they said they financed half the purchase. Their initial mortgage rate was 3.75%, and they later refinanced to around 3.1%.\n\n\"That seems to be the conventional wisdom, right? 'Oh, it's a low rate. Don't touch it,'\" Nathanson said.\n\nStill, they chose to eliminate their debt completely. Business Insider reviewed public records filed with the New York City Register that confirm the couple's mortgage was paid off in September 2024.\n\nIt was a \"psychological weight\" they lifted, Nathanson said, though the financial impact was significant as well. With their largest expense gone, his part-time salary now comfortably covers their costs, meaning they don't yet have to draw from their portfolio.\n\nFor Chang and Nathanson, the shift from autopilot to intention made all the difference.\n\n\"Don't make decisions just because that's what everyone around you is doing,\" Nathanson said.",

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Cavaliers emphatically got back to winning ways Tuesday, coasting to a 109-94 victory over the New York Knicks as their recent star signing James Harden scored 20 points.\n\nThe Cavs took the lead barely a minute into the game with an Evan Mobley three-pointer, and never gave it up in a thoroughly comfortable night for the red-hot Ohio franchise.\n\nFormer NBA Most Valuable Player Harden, who was brought in from the Los Angeles Clippers this month, has never won a championship despite being one of the most decorated players in the league.\n\nThat was a key factor in his move to the seemingly playoff-bound Cavs, where he has only suffered one loss across seven games, and \"The Beard\" excelled again, providing four assists against the Knicks.\n\n\"We're working to build something special, and each game is an opportunity to get better,\" said Harden. \"Tonight was a good step for us.\"\n\nIt was a return to form after their seven-game winning streak was snapped Sunday by the defending champions Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nHarden, 36, has given Cleveland another strong offensive threat alongside Donovan Mitchell, who led the scoring with 23 points.\n\nThe victory was underpinned by a powerful defensive performance, that saw the Knicks' star man Jalen Brunson restricted to 20 points.\n\n\"Tonight it was a team effort, and it's been like that since I've been here. That's one of the beauties about this team, any guy can get it going,\" added Harden.\n\nThey drew level on 37 wins and 22 losses with the Knicks -- third in the Eastern Conference -- who were poor with their shooting accuracy, making just 11 points in a shocking third quarter.\n\nElsewhere, Anthony Edwards poured in 34 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves earned a hard-fought 124-121 win against the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nEdwards -- MVP at this month's All-Star Game -- managed 25 of his points in an explosive first half.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets beat the Chicago Bulls 131-99, with rookie Kon Knueppel racing to his 200th three-pointer.\n\nAged 20, the Hornets prodigy is the fastest player to reach that mark in NBA history, requiring just 58 games.\n\nTyrese Maxey sank 32 points plus nine rebounds and eight assists as the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Indiana Pacers 135-114.\n\nThe Pacers reached last year's NBA Finals, but have struggled badly this campaign, sinking to the very bottom of the East.\n\nCongolese forward Jonathan Kuminga scored 27 points on his debut for the Atlanta Hawks in a 119-98 win over the Washington Wizards.\n\nThe Western Conference-leading Thunder racked up another win, seeing off the Toronto Raptors 116-107.\n\nAnd the Boston Celtics consolidated their grip on second spot in the East with a 97-81 win over the Phoenix Suns.",

    "description": "Elon Musk has never been one to hold back on social media, and his latest outburst has the internet buzzing. The Tesla CEO took to ... Read More",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has never been one to hold back on social media, and his latest outburst has the internet buzzing. The Tesla CEO took to X, the platform he owns, to blast The New York Times over a decade-old opinion piece that recently popped back into the spotlight.\n\nThe article in question suggested viewing pedophilia through a mental health lens rather than purely as criminal behavior. Musk's sharp words have reignited debates about media responsibility and child safety, drawing in politicians, influencers, and everyday users. Let's break down what happened, why it matters, and the wave of reactions it sparked.\n\nBack in October 2014, The New York Times published an op-ed by Margo Kaplan, a law professor at Rutgers University. Titled \"Pedophilia: A Disorder, Not a Crime,\" the piece argued that attractions to children should be treated as a psychiatric issue.\n\nKaplan pointed out that the DSM-5, the manual used by mental health professionals, classifies pedophilia as a paraphilic disorder when it causes distress or leads to harmful actions. She stressed that while any abuse of children remains illegal, recognizing the attraction as a disorder could help people get therapy before they act on impulses.\n\nThis wasn't a news story from the paper's reporters; it was an opinion column meant to spark discussion. Kaplan used examples from other mental health conditions, like substance abuse disorders, where treatment focuses on prevention rather than punishment for thoughts alone. At the time, it drew some criticism, but it faded from headlines.\n\nFast forward to early 2025, and the piece resurfaced amid broader talks about child exploitation cases, including references to high-profile figures like Jeffrey Epstein. U.S. Senator Mike Lee from Utah shared a screenshot of the headline on X, calling the idea \"delusional\" and insisting, \"No, it's a crime.\" His post quickly gained traction, setting the stage for Musk's involvement.\n\nMusk didn't hesitate to jump in. Replying to Lee's post, he labeled The New York Times \"utterly disgusting\" for running the op-ed. In another related comment, he went further, calling the outlet \"evil propaganda.\"\n\nThis fits Musk's pattern of clashing with mainstream media; he has accused them of bias and sensationalism on multiple occasions. For instance, he has previously criticized The Times for their coverage of Tesla and his personal life, once even tweeting that he might create a site to rate journalists' credibility.\n\nWhat made this slam stand out was the timing. Musk has positioned himself as a vocal advocate for child protection online. He has pushed for stricter content moderation on X to combat child exploitation material, and he often shares posts highlighting threats to kids. Users on the platform amplified his words, with his response racking up millions of views in hours.\n\nOne X user echoed Musk by saying the framing was \"dangerous\" and eroded trust in legacy media. Musk's history adds layers here; he once faced a defamation lawsuit after calling a British cave explorer \"pedo guy\" during the 2018 Thai cave rescue drama. A jury cleared him in 2019, ruling the term was an insult, not a factual claim.\n\nKaplan's piece wasn't defending child abuse; it made clear that actions like molestation are crimes deserving punishment. Instead, she highlighted how stigma prevents people with these attractions from seeking help.\n\nShe cited studies showing that many pedophiles never offend, but fear of legal repercussions keeps them silent. For example, she referenced Germany's Dunkelfeld project, which offers confidential therapy to non-offenders and has reportedly reduced risks.\n\nCritics, however, argue this approach blurs lines. They say labeling it a disorder risks normalizing something society views as morally wrong. Senator Lee's post captured this sentiment, rejecting any nuance and focusing on protection.\n\nThe op-ed also discussed legal barriers, like mandatory reporting laws that might deter therapy seekers. Kaplan suggested reforms to balance help with safety, such as better access to treatment without automatic criminalization for attractions alone. Despite these points, the headline's stark phrasing has fueled misinterpretations, leading some to claim The Times was soft on pedophilia.\n\nThe online response split sharply, with many echoing Musk's disgust. One X user wrote, \"Elon calling out NYT’s disgusting 2014 piece loud & clear — pedophilia is a CRIME, not a disorder to normalize. No debate. No excuses. Protect kids first, always.\"\n\nNot all agreed, though; some defended the op-ed's intent to promote treatment and reduce harm. A commenter noted, \"If The New York Times thought they were publishing nuance, they ended up serving nonsense. Elon calling them 'utterly disgusting' is blunt but when the subject is pedophilia, there’s no room for clever spin.\"\n\nOthers brought up unrelated scandals, like Epstein files, to question media priorities. The debate spilled into broader talks on U.K. policies releasing offenders for space, with Musk previously saying, \"I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts.\"\n\nThis episode highlights ongoing tensions between free speech, mental health advocacy, and zero-tolerance for child harm. Musk's platform amplified the debate, showing how old content can fuel new fires in today's fast-paced online world. As discussions continue, one thing is clear: topics like this touch deep nerves, prompting calls for accountability from all sides.",

    "description": "A New Yorker who lives in Puerto Vallarta half the year told Business Insider he had never experienced anything like the destruction in his community after a cartel leader was killed.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Steven Polito, 49, a drag performer from New York with the stage name Hedda Lettuce. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI am a native New Yorker who lives in Puerto Vallarta during the winter.\n\nAs a drag performer, it's a great place to be — it's a very LGBTQ+ friendly community here. There's a lot of theater, a lot of cabaret, and great restaurants. It's also walkable, which I love.\n\nThe moment you leave the house here, it's like one big \"hello.\" That's what's really special about this place.\n\nIt's why I come here — and why I'm still going to come back. Being part of a community means staying when things are tough.\n\nI went to the gym at 8:30 a.m., and I was struck by how unusually quiet it was. Then, my friend at the gym told me the city is under attack by a cartel, and I had to stay put.\n\nWhen I left around 10 a.m., it was a very different scene.\n\nEveryday life was juxtaposed against horrendous property damage. There was an older woman sweeping leaves in the street, while burned-out car after burned-out car was in flames.\n\nMy neighborhood was particularly hard-hit. One neighbor pointed out a burned-out car that belonged to another neighbor who's an Uber driver with two young children. That was the bulk of his income.\n\nMy nerves are shot a bit from the sensory overload of all of it. I've had some tough experiences, but never anything like this.\n\nAs I walked home from the gym, I saw a restaurant that I go to three, four times a week. They offered me coffee. Despite everything, they were trying to be good neighbors.\n\nI saw people were cleaning up the burned out cars: it's neighbors taking care of neighbors.\n\nI could go back to New York City, but we have to think in a less cavalier way. People who live here don't have the luxury of getting up and going.\n\nDuring COVID, I stayed in Puerto Vallarta the entire time instead of going back to the States. We all thought it was going to just crumble around us. But somehow, everyone found their way and part of that was through the community.\n\nThe strength of the community, that's what's so great about Puerto Vallarta.\n\nI've experienced it firsthand and that's what keeps it going. People persevere here.",

    "fullText": "Yankees trade may pay delayed dividends in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJake Bird did not hit the ground running with the New York Yankees.\n\nHe was one of the relief pitchers the Yanks acquired at last season's trade deadline, coming over from the Colorado Rockies with a lot of reasons to believe in him. And then he got shelled.\n\nThe good news for the Yankees and Bird, though, is that he's still with their organization. He has a shot at redemption.\n\nMLB.com's Bryan Hoch goes so far as to predict Bird as the ideal dark horse to find his way onto the Opening Day roster.\n\n\"Bird allowed seven runs (six earned) in two innings after being acquired from the Rockies last July, then spent the rest of the year in Triple-A,\" Hoch writes. \"That wasn’t the best first impression, but the 30-year-old looks different early in camp, crediting a full offseason working with the Yankees' pitching department. If he continues to generate ground balls and whiffs, Bird could be a nice bullpen find.\"\n\nMORE: Yankees making history not done since 1889 Chicago White Stockings\n\nThat had been of a surprisingly bad small sample size for Bird.\n\nHe had a 4.73 ERA with the Rockies before being traded to the Bronx, which you'd think is at least a little inflated by playing at Coors Field. Bird was also striking out 10.5 batters per nine innings in 2025.\n\nHis strikeout metrics last season were by far the best of his career, so the fear for Yankees fans would be that he was pitching over his head and simply regressed to who he had been before.\n\nBird was desired by more than just the Yanks at the deadline, though. Teams believe in his stuff.\n\nHe very well could prove to be a solid acquisition for New York, just with a bit of a delay in the return on investment.\n\nTeam USA has a finalized WBC roster and an awesome lineup\n\nDominican Republic WBC roster is loaded with stars\n\nAn Edwin Diaz nightmare looms for the Mets\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nHow Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nYankees have signed a catcher from the country of Hungary",

It will be nonexistent.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and a travel ban during a press conference on Sunday as a giant winter storm bore down on much of the Northeast.\n\nThe National Weather Service said to expect blizzard conditions and up to 20 inches of snow over the next 24 hours. Parts of New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts could get up to 25 inches.\n\n\"The state of emergency closes the streets, highways, and bridges of New York City for all traffic,\" Mamdani said. The travel ban begins at 9 p.m. Sunday and lasts until 12 p.m. on Monday. DoorDash, notably, also said it was suspending deliveries Sunday night.\n\nUS airlines, meanwhile, are canceling and delaying thousands of flights. As of Sunday afternoon, airlines had canceled over 3,000 flights and delayed over 2,900, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nNew York City's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports have the highest number of cancellations, followed by Newark Liberty International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and Boston Logan International Airport.\n\nAnyone hoping to catch a flight in the region on Monday can also expect major disruptions, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. At LaGuardia Airport, for example, 82% of flights scheduled for Monday have been canceled.\n\nAdding to what will likely be a chaotic 48 hours for travelers, the Department of Homeland Security announced Saturday night that it was suspending TSA PreCheck and Global Entry due to the partial government shutdown.\n\nDespite the announcement, however, TSA Precheck and Global Entry lanes remained open at major airports on Sunday. In a statement, the Transportation Security Administration said it is evaluating the situation \"case-by-case.\"\n\n\"At this time, TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,\" a spokesperson said. \"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis and adjust operations accordingly.\"\n\nThe federal government entered a partial shutdown earlier this month, delaying funding for some agencies, like DHS. TSA agents are essential workers, so they're still working — for now. During the full government shutdown earlier this year, TSA agents and air traffic controllers went 43 days without a paycheck.",

    "fullText": "New York Giants legend Eli Manning delivered a candid and optimistic assessment of quarterback Jaxson Dart's future during a recent appearance on ESPN New York with Dave Rothenberg and Rick DiPietro.\n\nAs the franchise transitions into a new era under head coach John Harbaugh, Manning expressed strong confidence in the direction of the team, particularly with Dart positioned as the long-term signal-caller.\n\nWhen asked about the excitement surrounding the Giants' fresh start, Manning responded affirmatively.\n\n\"No, I mean, I think you should be excited. I think the John Harbaugh hire,\" Manning said, \"you could not have asked for a better situation getting him... He’s the coach we needed, but usually, you know the coach that’s unavailable, and so I think there’s a lot of excitement there. You (have) Jaxson Dart... you have your quarterback of the future.\"\n\nManning went on to praise Dart's intangibles, highlighting his leadership qualities.\n\n\"Well, I just think he’s a great leader. I’ve seen that in the locker room, just how people talk about him. And obviously he has earned his teammates' respect through his preparation, through his play, and, you know, I think through his toughness,\" he said.\n\nThe two-time Super Bowl champion also offered pointed advice on the next phase of Dart's development, addressing the challenge many young, mobile quarterbacks face in balancing their athleticism with smarter decision-making.\n\n\"That’s kind of like the, you know, the next step for young quarterbacks is, hey, I have the ability to run, but I don’t want to do that too often. You know, I want to get the ball to the receivers,\" Manning said, \"it’s just kind of finding that sweet spot of, you know, when you know, hey, I need to get the ball out.\"\n\nManning's comments underscore a blend of endorsement and realism: Dart possesses the tools and presence to succeed, but refining his timing, progressions, and willingness to avoid unnecessary risks will be crucial to unlocking his full potential as the Giants' franchise quarterback.\n\nFans, long weary of quarterback instability, have reason for guarded optimism in this pairing of elite coaching and emerging talent.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Eli Manning offers blunt take on New York Giants QB Jaxson Dart",

    "fullText": "$75,300 can buy you a lot: a brand new Porsche, a gold Rolex, and, in New York City, one year of kindergarten.\n\nAs the city's affordability crisis deepens, the cost of everything from a slice of pizza to private school has risen to new heights.\n\nAvenues: The World School, a 14-year-old school in Chelsea, is the most expensive, with 2026-2027 tuition set at $75,300 for full-time nursery (age two) through grade 12, up about 4% from the current school year. That's $456 per day.\n\nIt's not alone. Next year, tuition at eight New York City private schools will top $70,000, Bloomberg reported. By comparison, the average tuition of the National Association of Independent Schools' member schools is $33,361 this year. Public school is, of course, free.\n\nFor thousands of parents across the five boroughs, the cost is worth it.\n\nSharon Decker, the cofounder of private school consultancy The Admissions Plan, told Business Insider that she's seen more applications for private schools in the area.\n\n\"It's getting more and more competitive at the upper tiers,\" she said. \"They're maintaining small class sizes; they're hiring expert faculty; they're offering expansive extracurriculars, and the infrastructure is rivaling a small college.\"\n\nFaculty is the main driver of price hikes at Avenues, Tara Powers, the school's head of communications, told Business Insider over email. As the cost of living in New York City continues to grow, the school must adjust, she said, adding that the costs of healthcare and other benefits have also increased.\n\nThough private school teachers don't get paid significantly more than their public school counterparts, there are more of them per student. Avenues has a student-to-teacher ratio of 5:1; New York City public schools have a ratio was 11.5:1.\n\nIt's the No. 1 area in which private schools stand out, Robin Aranow, the founder of a private and public school consultancy School Search NYC, told Business Insider.\n\nThen there's the auxiliary staff: teams of college counselors, learning specialists, advisors, and deans that form \"layers upon layers of support in the schools,\" Decker said.\n\nAvenues, unlike most other private schools, is a for-profit school; therefore, it doesn't report its finances.\n\nThe financial disclosure form for Collegiate, the city's second-most-expensive school, with tuition rising to $72,070 next year, indicates that faculty is, indeed, the school's largest expense. In 2024, the most recent year for which data is available, Collegiate spent $32 million, or 49% of its revenue — made up of tuition, gifts, and investment income — on compensation, including benefits and payroll tax.\n\nA representative for Collegiate did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAcross NAIS member schools, employee salaries accounted for more than 50% of schools' operating expenses, according to a 2025 report.\n\nBooks and other classroom supplies, lunch and snacks, musical instruments, and technology like iPads and MacBooks also factor into tuition. Plus the athletic uniforms, field trips, and costs associated with extracurriculars. There are no Amazon wishlists or classroom fundraisers, which have become popular at public schools.\n\n\"There are incredible athletic facilities with squash courts and Olympic-sized swimming pools,\" Decker said. \"Then for the theater kids, there are one or two black box theaters, and a main stage theater, and sound booths. For the tech kids, coding rooms and robotics rooms.\"\n\nAt least one school, Marymount, has Bloomberg Terminals available to students as part of its financial literacy and entrepreneurship curriculum.\n\n\"The private schools, I think, do a better job of creating what I might call a Renaissance kid,\" Aranow said.\n\nPart of the tuition helps float financial aid offerings. More than 20% of Avenues' students received financial aid this year, Powers said, with the school offering an average award of $49,000. Nearly 10% of Collegiate's 2024 revenue, or $6.2 million, went to grants and other assistance.\n\nStill, few parents who can afford private school are breaking down the five-figure bill to determine whether the line items add up to a good choice for their kid. There are many less tangible reasons they pony up: \"things like status, what other families are doing, what you did,\" Aronow said.\n\nPlus, one of the most valuable parts of a private school education, in the mind of some parents, is a big unknown that may not be resolved for 15 years, when their kids are applying to college.\n\n\"There are definitely families I work with who, when their kids are applying for kindergarten, are thinking about it already,\" Aranow said. \"Will my kid have a chance to go to an Ivy League school? That's what they all want to know.\"",

    "description": "I fell in love with New York City while in college, but I couldn't land a job after graduating. I had to leave the city to live with my parents.",
    "fullText": "My whole life, it felt like I was promised that if I got an undergraduate degree from a great university, I would get a good job and build a stable life for myself. Reality has been a lot messier.\n\nIn May 2024, I graduated from New York University with a degree in media studies and a minor in the entertainment business. Throughout college, I held multiple internships in political campaigns and magazines, was active on my school's newspaper, networked, did well in my classes, and learned as much as I could.\n\nNYU was my dream school for so long, and my experience turned out exactly how I thought it would. I fell in love with New York. I was living my dream life: spending late nights with my best friends, exploring the entertainment scene, discovering new restaurants and bars, and taking advantage of every park the city had to offer.\n\nBut when I couldn't land a job after college, I had to leave my dreams behind and move back home with my parents.\n\nI always felt inspired and hopeful in New York, like I finally arrived somewhere that matched the energy I had always carried inside me.\n\nI did everything I could to stay. I applied to many entry-level jobs during my last semester of college and the summer after graduation. I knew I wanted to pursue a career in journalism, so I mostly applied for entry-level reporting and copyediting jobs, as well as some marketing and social media management roles.\n\nI was able to score some interviews, but none turned into full-time offers.\n\nWhen my lease in my East Village apartment ended in July, I faced a hard truth: I couldn't afford to stay. I also didn't want to ask my parents for more financial help, knowing how much they had already supported me through school.\n\nThough I have a part-time job mentoring high school seniors through their college applications, I knew it wouldn't be enough to sustain living in New York while I tried to find a full-time job, and I had no idea how long it would take.\n\nI grew up in Santa Clarita, Calif., about 32 miles north of Los Angeles. It's a safe, quiet suburb where the pace of life is much slower than in New York.\n\nComing back after living in New York was a serious whiplash. My childhood bedroom suddenly felt smaller and quieter, and the absence of my college friends made the town feel emptier than I remembered.\n\nThere are some parts I am grateful for, though. After almost four years of seeing them only a handful of times a year, I finally get to spend more time with my parents. I also hated the harsh East Coast winters and definitely do not miss schlepping my Trader Joe's groceries down 10 blocks and then up four flights of stairs.\n\nThe pace here is gentler, the streets are quieter, and while it's not Manhattan, it's given me a space to breathe and reflect in ways I couldn't before.\n\nVisiting New York every few months reminds me why I fell in love with the city, but living at home has also shown me that slowing down is not the same thing as standing still. I've been creative with my career, focusing on writing, networking, and mentoring, while appreciating the small moments I took for granted in the city.\n\nI sometimes catch myself wondering, \"If I did this differently, would I be living and working in New York by now?\"\n\nI have to constantly remind myself that I am only 23 and I have a lot of life to live. New York will always be there. There have been many times when I doubted my career in journalism and considered quitting, but I love writing, and I have never been the type to give up.\n\nI am still looking for a full-time writing job in New York, but I'm learning not to let it define my entire identity.\n\nI am such a strong believer that life happens for a reason. Maybe living in Santa Clarita again is teaching me lessons I need before I return to the city I love.\n\nLiz Lindain is a freelance entertainment journalist based in Southern California.

    "fullText": "The Department of Labor’s (DOL) headquarters banned Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s husband after two women employed by the department alleged that he sexually assaulted them, The New York Times reported Thursday.\n\nThe staffers claimed that Dr. Shawn DeRemer touched them inappropriately inside the department building, with one of the incidents caught on security camera on Dec. 18, people familiar with the incident told the Times. The video shows DeRemer giving a woman an extended embrace, which was reviewed as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nAnother person told the newspaper the incidents were brought up during the DOL’s Office of Inspector General’s investigation into alleged misconduct between Chavez-DeRemer and two of her top staffers.\n\nThe Times obtained a Metropolitan Police Department report filed last month about forced sexual contact at the Labor Department building. The department’s sexual assault unit is investigating the incident.\n\nAfter DeRemer was barred from the building, a building restriction notice viewed by the Times read, “If Mr. DeRemer attempts to enter, he is to be asked to leave.”\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the DOL for comment.\n\nThe two staffers investigated for alleged misconduct, Chavez-DeRemer’s chief of staff Jihun Han and his deputy Rebecca Wright, were reportedly placed on leave amid the investigation into claims of personal trips with family and friends paid for with taxpayer dollars, the New York Post and Politico reported. Chavez-DeRemer was also accused of having an affair with a subordinate and drinking on the job, the outlets wrote.\n\n“There’s not an ounce of truth to this, and anyone who knows my wife would know that,” DeRemer said in a statement, the Post reported.\n\nThe DOL and White House also denied the allegations against Chavez-DeRemer. A DOL spokesperson told the Post that the “unsubstantiated allegations are categorically false.”",

    "description": "It might take the richest contract ever given to a center to bring Linderbaum to New York. Is he worth it?",
    "fullText": "Tyler Linderbaum might be at the top of the New York Giants’ NFL free agency wish list as they aim to upgrade in the trenches. Getting him, though, is not going to be easy. “Everybody” wants Linderbaum, according to NFL Network draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah.\n\n“I love my job, but if I could switch jobs for just the next couple months I’d want to be Tyler Linderbaum’s agent,” Jeremiah said Thursday on a pre-NFL Scouting Combine call with media. ‘Everybody that I talk to seems to be in on Tyler Linderbaum. It sounds like he’s going to have a robust market.“\n\nLinderbaum, of course, was the center for Giants coach John Harbaugh with the Baltimore Ravens for the past four years. The 25th pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, Linderbaum was named to the Pro Bowl in each of his last three seasons.\n\nEntering his age 26 season, Linderbaum is about to be a very rich young man. Creed Humphrey of the Kansas City Chiefs is the league’s highest-paid center. He signed a four-year, $72 million contract, an average of $18 million per year.\n\nLinderbaum’s contract, especially with a “robust market,” figures to equal or exceed that figure.\n\nThe Ravens are hoping to keep Linderbaum in Baltimore.\n\n“We got some work to do on Tyler Linderbaum’s contract,” DeCosta said on ‘The Inner Circle Podcast.’ “We strongly hope to have him back. He’s a great player for us and a great leader.”\n\nDo the Giants “need” Linderbaum badly enough to be willing to reset the center market financially? Perhaps not. John Michael Schmitz is a capable center who has improved in each of his first three seasons.\n\nLinderbaum, though, would be an upgrade. Harbaugh, who has said consistently that continuing to upgrade the talent on both the offensive and defensive lines is a must for the Giants, might be willing to do whatever it takes to get the player who orchestrated his offensive line in Baltimore.\n\nIs Linderbaum worth the biggest contract ever given to a center, Giants fans?",

    "fullText": "\"Should I go to the first day of the conference or see my daughter?\" I asked my group of fellow family travel writers during a Zoom meeting ahead of our work conference.\n\nThe conference would be held in New York City, where my 20-year-old daughter lives and goes to college.\n\nMy original plan was to attend the two-day conference and just have dinner with her, but then she surprised me with news. She had the whole day free, while I was in town.\n\nI decided to pull a Ferris Bueller.\n\nGrowing up, I watched \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" so many times I could've stepped in as his understudy.\n\nBut in high school, I wasn't the one jumping on parade floats or outsmarting the principal. I was more like Jeanie, the rule-following sister who never once considered skipping school.\n\nSo why did I love the movie? It wasn't just funny. It was the idea of being a maverick. As a lifelong rule-follower, Ferris represented a level of recklessness I usually reserved for using the grocery ten-item limit express lane.\n\nThis trip to New York was my chance to see my daughter. Sorry, not sorry, Principal Rooney. I'm taking the day off.\n\nEven though I grew up in New York and my daughter lives in the city, we decided to be total tourists for the day. Our CityPASS was our \"hall pass,\" giving us admission to the Guggenheim, the Empire State Building, and Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center.\n\nThe Guggenheim was first. As an art major, this was her pick. When I first saw her in the middle of the room surrounded by art, she had a huge smile on her face. I'd like to think it was because she was happy to see me (which I think she was), but it turns out she just learned some exciting news.\n\n\"I just got an email,\" she said. \"I got an interview for the Guggenheim internship.\"\n\nWhile we were standing in the Guggenheim.\n\nI looked around for hidden cameras and half-expected someone to yell \"Cut!\" This was too surreal. What were the odds she'd find out right now, in the middle of the gallery? Here I was escaping work responsibilities, while she was standing there successfully manifesting her own.\n\nHer excitement was infectious and set the tone for the rest of the day. I was so glad to experience that with her in person.\n\nAfter we soaked up the art, we went to the Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building. I realize that's a little redundant, but shockingly, my daughter had never been to the famous Empire State Building.\n\nAt the top, she marveled at how small everything looked from that height and discussed her plans to create art inspired by the experience.\n\nI, on the other hand, was glad to be in a tourist trap instead of a Q&A quagmire. At some point, I even forgot the conference existed.\n\nWe then opted for a three-hour Koreatown Food and Culture Walking Tour with a guide named Robert. He has Korean heritage and is a New Yorker, so it was the best of both worlds. It further helped me overcome my guilt about skipping the travel conference, and then I wondered, \"Could this count as professional development?\"\n\nMy daughter is almost done with college. She's already planning to stay in New York City over the summer, so I wouldn't be surprised if she sticks around after graduation.\n\nEven though we only spent eight hours together, it felt like a full-length Ferris film. It was definitely a better script than the one I was supposed to be following.\n\nThe following day, I attended my work conference, happy to have had that time with my daughter.\n\nIf Ferris Bueller taught us anything, it's that sometimes the side trip is the point.",

    "description": "My wife and I moved from New York City to Versailles, France, for her career. I expected my life to change here, but it looks largely the same.",
    "fullText": "We're a 10-minute walk from the Palace of Versailles. My wife attends ISIPCA, one of the most prestigious graduate perfumery programs in the world, and I'm an American writer living right outside Paris.\n\nIt may sound glamorous, but my daily routine hasn't really changed. Before our move in October, I sat in front of a computer all day. After our move, my life has looked pretty much the same.\n\nI must admit, there was a wide-eyed part of me that thought the lifestyle of an American expat living outside Paris would all but confirm my Great American Novel, but the reality was much more boring.\n\nAlthough there are major differences in etiquette, architecture, food, and language, as a work-from-home writer, I was surprised to find myself mostly insulated from them.\n\nI arrived here knowing nobody but my wife. Most of the time, I'm alone all day.\n\nSometimes I FaceTime friends and family back home, but the six-hour time difference forms a barrier. By the time they're getting off work, it's midnight in Versailles.\n\nI can go days without speaking French, unless you count Babbel.\n\nWhen I do, it's in 60-second batches, ordering a baguette at the nearby boulangerie or picking up a cheap bottle of Beaujolais at the local épicerie for a carb-heavy dinner.\n\nThen, I return to the apartment to write in English for hours on end, which is the same way I spent my time in New York.\n\nGranted, there are reminders even in my apartment that I'm in a different place: The hot water doesn't last long, the kitchen tile is a dark terra-cotta with darker grout, and the labels of the spices and sauces left behind in the kitchen are, naturally, all in French.\n\nWhen I look out of the window, I see the slate-colored mansard roofs that match the persistent gray of wintry Versailles.\n\nAfter a while, though, even these charming distinctions recede into the furniture of daily life.\n\nAs an expat working remotely, I soon realized I would have to be proactive if I wanted to meet new people.\n\nThe halcyon days of friends falling into my lap — as in college or in my early career, when my coworkers functioned as my adoptive New York family — were long gone. No, I would have to take initiative.\n\nI made an effort to tap into the community of expat writers in Paris. I connected with a couple of Paris-based writers online, and then met up with them for coffee.\n\nOne of them, a poet and a scholar, told me about an Anglophone writers' salon in Paris. I went to the event, read some of my work, and met fellow English-speaking writers, mostly American and British.\n\nAnother invited me to a literary journal launch event in Le Marais. At the launch party, I ran into a few people I'd met at the salon a couple of days earlier, including a friendly English guy who invited me to a reading at his apartment in the 19th arrondissement.\n\nEarlier that week, I didn't know anyone in Paris. Suddenly, I was bumping into people I knew at a party, then getting invited to another one.\n\nParties always come to an end. Daily routine reasserts itself. My wife leaves first thing and doesn't return until dark.\n\nDuring the day, all I hear is the clacking of the keys and the groaning of the floorboards whenever I walk to the kitchen for another cup of coffee. I welcome chores and errands, which break up the lonely monotony.\n\nWhen my wife comes home and asks me how my day was, I don't know how to respond. \"Same,\" I think. \"Always the same.\"\n\nThat's not entirely true, though. Some days are punctuated by heartwarming messages or small wins, like a friend reaching out or an editor accepting one of my stories.\n\nThe bulk of my daily activities, however, remains unchanged. Admittedly, this malaise may be more a function of remote work than being alone in a strange place; I felt a similar isolation working remotely in New York, after all.\n\nIt took my wife and me years to start to find a sense of community in our neighborhood. That didn't just happen. We had to work for it. Around the time we were figuring that out, my wife got her acceptance letter.\n\nI suppose the repetitiveness of daily life is hardly unique, but I was surprised to find how similar it was here. Routine notwithstanding, I'm lucky. I live in a beautiful place, and I get to do the thing I love, as does my wife.\n\nLiving in Versailles has put into focus something that was starting to come into view back in the US: The life you want doesn't come knocking on your door, regardless of where you are.

    "fullText": "Alexander Nathanson always wanted to live in Manhattan.\n\n\"When you get to Manhattan, you've made it in New York,\" the Brooklyn native told Business Insider.\n\nWhen he and Josette Chang married in 2018, they fulfilled that dream by buying an apartment together in Midtown East. Beyond the personal significance for Nathanson, the purchase also made financial sense.\n\nChang, who had been renting in New York since moving there for graduate school, was tired of the annual rent hikes. \"I realized, 'Wow, this is only going to go up.'\"\n\nThe couple went from pricey New York City rent to a monthly mortgage, and, eventually, to an incredibly low housing payment when they paid off their mortgage early in 2024. For the past year and a half, their only housing expense has been the monthly maintenance fee that comes with co-op living. Business Insider reviewed public records filed with the New York City Register that confirm the couple's mortgage was paid off in September 2024.\n\nThat same year, Chang quit her finance job and began early retirement. Nathanson, a physician specializing in obesity medicine, scaled back his hospital hours.\n\nAs of February 2026, the financially independent couple comfortably lives off Nathanson's part-time salary. They could draw from their investment portfolio if needed, but they haven't had to.\n\nEliminating their mortgage played a major role in reaching that flexibility. So did earning high incomes and avoiding significant debt early on.\n\nNathanson said he paid off a relatively modest amount of student loans after attending medical school in-state. Chang had no student debt and was able to save aggressively in her 20s while working in Taiwan and living with her parents, keeping her expenses low.\n\n\"We have to acknowledge our privilege,\" Nathanson said. \"We're two high-income professionals, but even then, I still feel like more people can do it than may realize it.\"\n\nTheir path to financial independence wasn't built on stock picking or rental properties. Instead, it came down to a few deliberate choices.\n\nBefore hiring a financial planner, Chang and Nathanson were saving, but without a clear plan.\n\n\"We were kind of on autopilot,\" Nathanson said. \"We didn't have a clear strategy in mind. The internet says, 'Max out your 401(k).' We did that, but we didn't really think much beyond that.\"\n\nNow, their portfolio is intentionally simple, consisting of just three low-cost index funds: a total US stock market fund, a total international stock market fund, and a total bond market fund.\n\nThey've deliberately avoided more speculative investments, such as individual stock picking and cryptocurrency.\n\n\"We just feel those types of investments have less track record and a higher risk profile,\" Chang said. \"At the point we are in our lives, we're comfortable relying on the historical performance of index funds.\"\n\nThe couple's financial plan is also shaped by their decision not to have children.\n\n\"We don't plan to have a large estate that we want to pass down,\" Nathanson said. They've completed estate and long-term care planning with the understanding that they won't have children as default caregivers.\n\n\"We like the 'Die With Zero' approach: Use the money when you can. There's no point in continuing to accumulate forever,\" he added, referring to Bill Perkins' book, which encourages prioritizing life experiences over endlessly growing a portfolio.\n\nFor them, financial independence isn't about building the biggest possible net worth. It's about having the flexibility to spend intentionally on experiences and priorities that matter to them.\n\nAlthough Nathanson's part-time income means they aren't currently drawing from their investments, they know they could.\n\n\"We did the math and realized we can start spending it down,\" he said. \"Ironically, we're not doing that yet because I'm still working, but I'm doing that not out of necessity. It's because it's what I want to be doing.\"\n\nEarning two professional salaries in New York City can create pressure to spend accordingly. For Nathanson and Chang, avoiding lifestyle inflation has been central to reaching financial independence.\n\n\"As income goes up, we try to be intentional about what we spend money on,\" said Nathanson.\n\nThey nearly upgraded to a larger apartment, but ultimately decided against it. \"We looked at bigger places and really thought about it: 'Do we need to sell our current place just to move into a slightly bigger one in the same neighborhood?'\" he said.\n\nThey decided the answer was no.\n\n\"Moving up would be just riding the hedonic treadmill,\" he said. \"You get a bigger place now, and a few years later you'll want a bigger place again. We consciously decided to get off that treadmill.\"\n\nChang added that mindset plays a huge role, especially in a city like New York.\n\n\"Comparison is the thief of your joy,\" she said. \"When you live here, it's easy to see what everyone else is doing, especially on social media. But it's important to stay on course and remember why you're doing this.\"\n\nFor them, that \"why\" was work optionality.\n\n\"Identify what's important for you,\" Nathanson said. \"Don't be on autopilot. Don't make decisions just because that's what everyone around you is doing.\"",

    "fullText": "A dominant Cade Cunningham scored 42 points as the NBA-leading Detroit Pistons swatted aside the New York Knicks 126-111 Thursday on the basketball league's return from its brief All-Star Game break.\n\nBilled as a must-watch clash between two Eastern Conference-vying rivals each in red-hot form, the game at Madison Square Garden became an exhibition for Cunningham, who also provided 13 assists and eight rebounds.\n\nThe 24-year-old burnished his credentials as a Most Valuable Player contender, helping a young, surprise-package Pistons side to improve the best record in the entire NBA this season so far, to 41-13.\n\nAfter the game, Cunningham insisted he and his side had proved \"nothing\" yet.\n\n\"It's regular season, so we just have to keep on chipping at it, keep on growing, keep on getting better and preparing for the postseason,\" he said.\n\n\"We're off to a great start. Obviously, we feel great about that. But everything is to come.\"\n\nDespite their blistering form, Detroit -- wholly reconstructed after finishing rock-bottom of the Eastern Conference just two years ago -- are still few pundits' top pick to win the title.\n\nThey were also without forward Isaiah Stewart and All-Star center Jalen Duren on Thursday, due to suspensions following a brawl with the Charlotte Hornets during game last week.\n\n\"Missing Stew, JD, that's a big part of our team. Big part of why we are where we are. So everyone had to step up,\" said Cunningham.\n\nAnd the Knicks had entered the game third in the Eastern Conference, on a run of 10 wins from 12, comparable to the Pistons' 12 from 15 ahead of Thursday's clash.\n\nBut Detroit had extra motivation -- revenge after the Knicks knocked them out of the playoffs last year in the first round. The win on Thursday completes a three-win regular season sweep over the Knicks.\n\n\"If felt great,\" said Cunningham, who poured in three three-pointers in the first quarter alone. He added two more later in the game, with other highlights including a huge, driving dunk in the third quarter.\n\nElsewhere, Jaylen Brown recorded a triple-double as the in-form Boston Celtics overwhelmed the Golden State Warriors 121-110.\n\nConsolidating second spot in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics led by as much as 34 points in the third quarter, before the Warriors reduced the deficit but to no avail.\n\nBrown managed 23 points, 13 assists and 15 rebounds, while Payton Pritchard top-scored with 26 from the bench, in the Celtics' seventh win from their past eight games.\n\nThursday's games were the first since the NBA regular season briefly paused for the All-Star Game weekend.\n\n\"It's early, first game back,\" said Brown.\n\n\"I'm just being aggressive, finding my spots,\" he added.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers earned a sixth consecutive win. The Cavs beat the Brooklyn Nets 112-84 to draw level with the Knicks in third place.\n\nJalen Johnson dominated a 117-107 Atlanta Hawks road win over the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring 32 points, with 10 rebounds, five assists and three steals.\n\nKevin Durant managed 35 points in the Houston Rockets' 105-101 victory over the Hornets.\n\nIn the West, the Sacramento Kings set an unwanted franchise record with a 15-game losing streak, after going down 131-94 to the Orlando Magic.\n\nAnd the second-placed San Antonio Spurs put some pressure on the leaders, Oklahoma City Thunder, with a 121-94 triumph over the Phoenix Suns.\n\nThe Spurs' seventh consecutive win takes them to 39-16, still trailing the Thunder on 42-14.",

    "description": "New York's governor dropped a proposal to allow unmanned robotaxis, days after Waymo raised $16 billion to fund its expansion to more cities in the US.",
    "fullText": "The autonomous vehicle industry just faced a setback in New York.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul dropped a proposal to allow robotaxi companies to operate commercially without human safety drivers in parts of the state outside New York City, dealing a blow not just to Waymo but also to its competitors eager to crack one of the world's largest taxi markets.\n\nThe proposal, which Hochul introduced last month as part of her budget plan, would have created a framework for limited robotaxi deployments elsewhere in the state while leaving any decision about New York City to the mayor and city council.\n\nBased on the proposal, private companies like Waymo and Tesla would be able to operate their commercial robotaxis if they could obtain approval from local governments. On Thursday, the governor's office confirmed that the plan had been withdrawn after failing to gain legislative support.\n\nThe move is a blow to Waymo, which has eyed New York, especially New York City, for years as a potential growth market. Waymo is currently testing vehicles with safety drivers in New York City under a permit approved during former Mayor Eric Adams' administration, though that permit expires March 31. It is unclear if Mayor Zohran Mamdani will agree to renew the permit.\n\nIn a blog post on Monday, Waymo said it raised $16 billion in its most recent funding round, which valued the company at $126 billion. The investment would be used to finance the company's expansion to over 20 more cities, said Waymo.\n\nAccording to state lobbying records, the Alphabet-owned company has been lobbying Hochul, state senators, state assembly members, as well as Blake Washington, who is the state's budget director, over the past six months. Other companies that are developing robotaxis don't have notable lobbying records specific to New York.\n\nNew York law allows autonomous vehicles only if a human safety driver keeps their hands on the steering wheel. Earlier versions of the law even required a police escort, but that provision was later removed.\n\nAutonomous vehicle makers have struggled to gain a foothold in New York. Cruise shelved plans to test in Manhattan in 2017 before the company folded entirely, while Optimus Ride and Mobileye have run limited pilots. None has thus far managed to provide unsupervised commercial rides in the Big Apple.\n\nThere are other active bills that would allow robotaxis to run in the state if such plans could gain enough legislative support. Brian A. Cunningham, who represents the 43rd Assembly District in Central Brooklyn, has sponsored a bill that would allow a person or a company to operate a fully autonomous vehicle on the public roads without a human driver, \"provided that the automated driving system is engaged and the vehicle meets certain conditions.\"\n\nThe bill in question was first referred to the Committee of Transportation on January 7. Based on state lobbying records, Waymo lobbyists met with Cunningham between November and December 2025.\n\nWaymo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "Richard Boccato turned his bartending career into a successful, multimillion-dollar ice business serving top NYC bars and restaurants.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Richard Boccato, owner and operator of Hundredweight Ice in Queens, New York City. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFor years, I made my living bartending in New York City. I recognized early on that ice was perhaps the most important and overlooked ingredient in the modern cocktail.\n\nIf you're going to take measures to use fresh ingredients, squeeze your juice à la minute (just before serving), make your syrups in-house, procure the finest spirits, and then marry all of that to an inferior quality of frozen water, it would amount to a fool's errand in the glass, especially in exchange for top American dollar.\n\nThat said, never, at any point when I was bartending, would I have imagined that I would one day be a business owner of an ice company. My path to becoming an ice man began with a freezer full of rust-colored ice.\n\nWhile bartending at two of the best bars in New York City, I was fortunate to rise through the ranks enough that the owner of those bars asked me if I wanted to go into business with him and open a bar together. We called it Dutch Kills.\n\nWhen the day came to get ready to open Dutch Kills for the first time in 2009, I opened the chest freezer and saw a rust-colored, reddish-brown block of cloudy ice. The pipes coming into the building were not suitable for the quality of water that I wanted to serve, so instead I decided to source crystal-clear blocks of ice from a local ice sculptor.\n\nCustomers were immediately impressed by the opulence, beauty, and clarity of the sourced ice. Ultimately, we were making enough money as a business that it seemed viable to reinvest some of it in our own ice block maker.\n\nAt the time, though, I was only interested in making enough ice for our bar, not starting a business with it. By 2011, however, word had gotten around about the quality of our drinks, and a lot of bars were interested in obtaining ice from us.\n\nI didn't have the money or the infrastructure to launch a cocktail ice business, but I decided to do it anyway. I called it Hundredweight Ice.\n\nThe way that we used to make our ice is vastly different from how we make it today.\n\nIn the early days, it was me, Pedro, my first full-time employee, and Ian, my business partner, in the back of Dutch Kills, breaking down 300-pound blocks of crystal-clear ice with chainsaws and finishing the cubes by creasing all six sides with clothing irons to achieve smooth surfaces and clean edges.\n\nObviously, our techniques and practices weren't sophisticated at all in the beginning. If I had been an outsider walking into the storage room of that bar and saw the setup we were working with, I'd have thought, \"These people have no chance of survival.\"\n\nMany of my industry peers and former co-workers did, in fact, tell me that I was crazy for thinking this would ever work.\n\nOver the years, we kept making ice and the business kept growing. I had to stop bartending and focus my attention on the ice business. At a certain point, it dawned on me that I wasn't a full-time bartender anymore. I was an ice man now, and that was somewhat of a difficult and unexpected career transition to accept, but it was also very empowering because it meant we had succeeded in doing what we had set out to do.\n\nWe were forced to move the ice business back into the back house of Dutch Kills. We struggled from ruin to recovery, and toward the end of 2021, we broke ground on a new warehouse just a stone's throw from the old one, which is still where we make our ice today — having just expanded to an additional 3,000 square feet next door.\n\nWe now deliver ice to over 20 Michelin-starred restaurants, and our clients in New York City number in the triple digits.\n\nIn 2025, our revenue was close to $3 million, and we are on track to significantly surpass that in 2026, with projected revenue of $3.5 million.\n\nWe start our days between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. and finish by about 3 p.m. We cut about 15,000 2-inch cubes of ice per day and harvest over 3 million pounds of ice each year.\n\nThe investment is tremendous, but necessary to achieve the final product. For example, the upfront costs for some of the equipment include:\n\nOne thing we're proud of is that we haven't raised our prices a penny since 2017. A 50-pack of 2-inch cubes sells for $30. Logo cubes average about $100 per pack.\n\nThe only reason this company exists is because we wanted to make our cocktails at Dutch Kills the best they could be. I didn't expect that it would turn into the business that it is now.",

    "description": "Kathryn Shiber is suing Centerview over claims of disability discrimination. Court docs suggest Wall Street culture itself will also be on the stand.",
    "fullText": "A lawsuit offering a rare look at the daily grind of junior investment bankers is scheduled to begin next week, and court documents suggest that potential jurors will be asked to reckon with their relationship to Wall Street culture.\n\nThe case hinges on Kathryn Shiber, who alleges that boutique investment bank Centerview Partners violated disability discrimination laws when it fired her because she couldn't consistently work into the early morning hours. Shiber joined the firm as a junior banker in July 2020, after graduating from Dartmouth College. After a few consecutive days working past midnight, she said told human resources that she had to get between eight and nine hours of sleep each night because of an underlying mood and anxiety disorder, and got approval for some accommodations. In September, the New York-based firm fired her because she could not perform the essential job functions, according to her suit.\n\nThe proposed voir dire questions — the screening questions lawyers use to assess whether potential jurors can be impartial— hint that Wall Street's notoriously grueling culture will be on display once the trial kicks off.\n\n\"Do you feel it is fair for an employer to expect that employees work long or unpredictable hours if employees are compensated for those hours?\" Centerview proposes asking in its voir dire document.\n\nCenterview has also proposed asking potential jurors whether they have \"any opinions or beliefs about Wall Street, the finance industry, or investment banking\" that would impact their impartiality. Shiber's lawyers take it a step further, proposing that they ask specifically whether jurors have \"strong opinions\" about investment banking or \"people who work\" in the industry.\n\nDepositions filed in the case indicate that junior bankers, formally known as first-year analysts, should expect to work between 60 and 120 hours per week. Hours are unpredictable and can stretch into the early morning, Tony Kim, then a partner and now the co-president of investment banking at Centerview, said in his deposition. 24-hour days are possible, but rare, he said, adding that juniors staffed on an active deal are expected to check in before going to sleep.\n\n\"Junior bankers obviously don't need permission to go to sleep, but are expected to work together and communicate properly with teammates,\" Centerview told Business Insider in a statement. Shiber's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth sides have also proposed quizzing jurors on mental health and discrimination. Centerview's attorneys, for example, have proposed asking potential jurors whether they have ever requested accommodations at a job for a disability or filed a grievance for employment-related reasons.\n\n\"Do you think today's employment laws make it too easy for an employee to sue an employer for discrimination?\" Shiber's lawyers proposed asking.\n\nJunior bankers' mental health came under intense scrutiny in 2024, after Leo Lukenas III, an investment banking associate at Bank of America, died. Some firms implemented policies they said would help track and limit hours. But 2026 is expected to see an M&A boom, potentially pushing junior bankers to log even more hours as deal activity picks up.\n\nJurors could also be asked about Centerview bankers who might come up at trial. The voir dire questionnaire from Shiber's lawyers shows they have considered asking about Robert Pruzan, the firm's cofounder and a well-known M&A banker.\n\nWall Street, known for its high pay, has at times become a cultural flashpoint — most notably during the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests over the financial crisis. More recently, President Donald Trump has introduced a policy that he has said will lower costs for everyday Americans by capping the interest banks can charge on credit cards to 10% for a year.\n\nAll the while, finance titans are earning record pay, and Americans' relationship to capitalism itself is changing — meaning that answering voir dire questions about the people who dot the halls of prestigious firms may not be a simple task.",

    "fullText": "Ex-NBA star Enes Kanter Freedom piled on to the often-conservative criticism of freestyle skiing great Eileen Gu on Wednesday.\n\nGu, whose mother is Chinese, was born in San Francisco but is representing China for the second straight Winter Olympics.\n\nPolitics: Trump's Latest Epstein Denial Has Critics Asking New Questions\n\nShe has earned China two silver medals in the Milan Cortina Games with the halfpipe up next. She won two golds and a silver in 2022. She has vaulted to international fame as an athlete and sometimes a model, reportedly earning tens of millions of dollars a year ― a chunk of which she has received from the Chinese government.\n\nBut as in the last Winter Olympics, Gu has gotten heat for her choice, though it should be noted that several U.S.-born athletes compete for other countries. Brazil’s Lucas Pinheiro Braathen, who was born in Oslo but has a Brazilian mother, has been widely celebrated during the Games for representing a country other than his birthplace. Gu’s defenders have suggested that racism and Sinophobia are factors in why she is being treated differently.\n\n“I’m just going to say it. She’s a traitor,” Freedom told Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Wednesday. “She was born in America. She was raised in America, lives in America, and chooses to compete against her own country for, literally, the worst human rights abuser on the planet, China. She built her fame in a free country, and then chooses to represent an authoritarian regime.”\n\nKanter Freedom: Eileen Gu Is a traitor. She was born in America and chooses to compete against her own country. pic.twitter.com/gAh4YbrFpt\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) February 18, 2026\n\nThe former center, who played for the Utah Jazz, New York Knicks and other teams in the NBA from 2011 to 2022, added “Freedom” to his name when he became a U.S. citizen in 2021. The former Turkish citizen was outspoken against the Turkish government and had his passport canceled by the country in 2017. He often speaks out against human rights abuses in China.\n\nBefore the Games, Gu defended her choice to represent China.\n\nPolitics: Money And Power Converge As CBS Becomes Trump State Media\n\n“The U.S. already has the representation,” Gu said, per Newsweek. “I like building my own pond.”\n\nShe also dismissed speculation that she chose China because the financial windfall was potentially greater.\n\n“I’m glad that there’s enough money in the sport now for people to think that’s a consideration,” Gu said.\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nEven Vice President JD Vance weighed in about Gu’s decision, starting off diplomatically but eventually throwing some shade her way.\n\nAsked by Fox News’ Martha MacCallum on Tuesday if the status of the San Francisco-born athlete should be “changed,” the veep replied: “Well, look, I have no idea what her status should be. I think that’s ultimately up to the Olympics Committee. I won’t pretend to wade into that.”\n\nPolitics: Homeland Security Flack Tricia McLaughlin Set To Leave Trump Administration\n\n“I certainly think that somebody who grew up in the United States of America, who benefited from our education system, from the freedoms and liberties that make this country a great place, I would hope that they want to compete with the United States of America,” he added.\n\n“So, I’m going to root for American athletes, and I think part of that is people who identify themselves as Americans. That’s who I’m rooting for this Olympics,” Vance said.\n\nFox News Host Asks Vance If U.S.-Born Olympian Should Lose ‘Status’ Skiing For China\n\nOlympian's *** Confession Spreads To Another Sport In Wild 'Late Show' Send-Up\n\nItaly Taunts U.S. In Oh-So-Familiar Style After Winning Speedskating Team Event",

    "description": "The Trump administration is disputing a new paper from the New York Federal Reserve that asserts US consumers and businesses are bearing the bulk of the higher costs from tariffs imposed last year.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is disputing a new paper from the New York Federal Reserve asserting that US consumers and businesses are bearing the bulk of the higher costs from tariffs imposed last year.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think it's the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve System. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion, which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan, based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class.\"\n\nWhat percentage of tariff costs did US consumers bear?\n\nHow did the Trump administration respond to the study?\n\nWhat did the NY Fed study find about tariff costs?\n\nHow did tariff pass-through rates change throughout 2025?\n\nAuthors Mary Amiti, head of labor and product markets at the New York Fed's Research and Statistics Group, along with research analyst Chris Flanagan and research economist Sebastian Heise, analyzed the tariffs instituted last year and found that 94% were borne by the US in the first eight months of 2025. Just 6% of those costs were absorbed by foreign exporters.\n\nThe analysis covered 12-month changes from January 2024 through November 2025 (the most recent available data). The analysis also noted how the pass-through of costs changed over the course of 2025. For instance, by November, the pass-through of costs borne in the US had declined to 86%.\n\nThe authors said their results show that a 10% tariff led to only a 0.6 percentage-point decline in foreign export prices. But they also found that the tariff pass-through into import prices declined later last year, as more exporters bore the costs of tariffs. In November, a 10% tariff was associated with a 1.4% decline in foreign export prices, though still an 86% pass-through to US import prices.\n\nThe authors said the higher import prices caused firms to reorganize their supply chains.\n\n\"In sum, U.S. firms and consumers continue to bear the bulk of the economic burden of the high tariffs imposed in 2025,\" the authors wrote.\n\nHassett maintains that tariffs affect a multitude of price factors, including supply and demand, which shift around consumer and producer surpluses.\n\n\"They’re basically only looking at changes in prices,\" Hassett said.\n\nHe pointed to other metrics, such as lower inflation and higher wages, which suggest consumers are better off.\n\n\"Incomes are up way more than the cost of living, and that's the real wage gain that this silly Fed study neglects to mention,\" Hassett said.",

    "title": "Why Berkshire Hathaway's New York Times bet is a fitting end to the Warren Buffett era",
    "description": "Warren Buffett went from delivering newspapers to owning dozens of them. Berkshire Hathaway bought a New York Times stake in his final quarter as CEO.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought one new stock in his last quarter as CEO: The New York Times Company. It's a fitting final bet for the Buffett era.\n\nThe famed investor's conglomerate scooped up around 5.1 million shares of the newspaper publisher, securing a stake worth $352 million at December's close, a Tuesday filing revealed.\n\nThe position's small size points to one of Buffett's two investment managers at the time — Ted Weschler and the since-departed Todd Combs — making the purchase.\n\nBuffett is a lifelong lover of newspapers. He delivered 500,000 papers as a teenager running multiple routes, and for years, he challenged shareholders to best him at newspaper tossing during Berkshire's annual meetings.\n\nHe went from throwing newspapers to owning dozens of publishers, including The Buffalo News and The Omaha World-Herald. He was close friends with the late publisher of The Washington Post, Katharine Graham, and one of the paper's biggest financial backers.\n\nDuring Berkshire's 2010 meeting, he recalled looking at the circulation of major titles such as the San Francisco Chronicle, and said it \"blows your mind how fast people are dropping it.\"\n\n\"The world has really changed, in terms of the essential nature of newspapers,\" he said.\n\nIn 1965 or 1970, there was \"probably nothing looked more bulletproof than a daily newspaper where the competition had melted away,\" he continued. \"But it's a form of distributing information and entertainment that has lost its immediacy in many cases.\"\n\nBuffett pointed out that people no longer rely on papers to find out how their stocks were performing, or whether their sports team won. The resulting decline in circulation made newspapers less attractive to advertisers, he noted.\n\n\"And so you get this chicken and egg thing that the newspaper becomes less valuable as the advertisers float away, and the advertisers float away as the subscribers diminish,\" he said.\n\nDespite his concerns, he acquired 28 daily papers in the early 2010s.\n\n\"Charlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly-bound communities and having a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time,\" Buffett wrote in his 2012 letter to shareholders. \"Charlie\" referred to his late business partner, Charlie Munger.\n\n\"Newspapers continue to reign supreme ... in the delivery of local news,\" he added.\n\nBuffett struck a far more bearish tone in 2019, telling Yahoo Finance that he expected only a few national titles, such as The New York Times, to survive, while the rest would \"disappear.\" He also bemoaned the demise of the newspaper ad business.\n\n\"It went from monopoly to franchise to competitive to ... toast,\" he said.\n\nBuffett offloaded Berkshire's newspapers to publisher Lee Enterprises in 2020. Given his long history in the newspaper business and eventual exit from it, it's striking to see Berkshire return with its recent stock purchase.\n\nOne reason was undoubtedly The New York Times' recovery in recent years. It grew revenues by 9% to $2.8 billion and its net income by 17% to $344 million last year, as subscription revenues rose 9% and advertising revenues jumped 12%.\n\nA key driver was the paper's addition of 1.4 million digital-only subscribers, which lifted its total subscriber count to 12.78 million as of December 31.\n\nThe publisher's stock price has already seen some of the benefits. After collapsing from over $50 in mid-2002 to below $5 in early 2009, it has surged roughly 15-fold — including 50% in the past year — to trade at a record high of $74 at Tuesday's close.\n\nThe shares gained another 3% in Wednesday's premarket, perhaps marking one of the final cases of the \"Buffett Effect,\" where other investors mimic his buys and sells, moving markets.\n\nThe publisher's comeback might explain why Buffett and his team decided to revisit one of his favorite industries so soon after turning the page.",

    "description": "Levittown in Long Island, New York, was built in 1947 as a suburban community for America's growing families. Here's what it was like in the '50s.",
    "fullText": "As World War II came to an end, families looked for ways to start over. Emboldened by the GI Bill's provisions for home loans, they moved out of the cities in droves for newly developed suburban communities.\n\nIn fact, the suburbs expanded by 47% during the 1950s, according to the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History.\n\nLevittown in Long Island, New York, was one of the first to introduce the idea of a pre-planned, mass-produced uniform suburban community, The New York Times reported. Families started moving there on October 1, 1947.\n\nThough the community welcomed an influx of families, non-white prospects weren't allowed. Notably, African Americans didn't see the same benefits from the GI Bill, and it would take some years before racial and ethnic minorities broadly shifted to the suburbs.\n\nHere's what it was like to live in America's first modern suburb in the 1950s.\n\nAt the time, most people lived close to the city center to work in factories, or they lived in rural communities to work on farms, according to economist Jay Zagorsky.\n\nThe 1950 Census found that 60% of people lived in cities, while 40% lived in the suburbs.\n\nThanks to factors like the construction of highways, the development of new neighborhoods from farmland, and even safety in the event of an atomic attack, these percentages would soon shift drastically.\n\nThe GI Bill provided each returning soldier with benefits designed to stimulate economic growth. Each soldier was given a year of unemployment and free tuition to go to college. The military pledged to back all home loans, which allowed veterans to buy houses with little to no down payments.\n\nShortly after WWII ended, the Baby Boom began. In 1946, 3.4 million babies were born, more than ever before, and 20% more than in 1945, per History.com. This trend continued into the '50s.\n\nMost historians think it was because Americans were eager to have families after having postponed marriage and childbirth because of the Great Depression and World War II.\n\nWhatever the reason, people flocked to the suburbs to accommodate their growing families.\n\nDuring the war, factories focused on creating wartime essentials, like airplanes and barracks. In the '50s, they refocused their efforts on building home components and automobiles using the new practices — like the assembly line — they implemented in the war,\n\nAs a result, factories were able to produce materials for homes faster than ever before.\n\nLevitt and Sons, a construction company, purchased a 7-square-mile plot of potato and onion farms in Long Island in 1947. They set out to build one of the first uniform suburban communities in the US.\n\nTo construct the new community, which sits about 30 miles east of Manhattan, Levitt and Sons hired mostly unskilled workers to build the homes. They gave each a specific skill and created a sort of human assembly line. William Levitt even called his firm \"the General Motors of the housing industry,\" The Guardian reported.\n\nThe Levitts eventually constructed 17,447 houses between 1947 and 1951. During the peak of the construction boom, one was built every 16 minutes.\n\nThe first homes in Levittown cost new residents around $7,000, The Guardian reported. For veterans, there was no down payment.\n\nWhen adjusting for inflation, a Levittown home in 1950 would be roughly $97,000 in today's money.\n\nAt first, all the homes were built in the same style, and some residents even admitted to walking into the wrong house at times because they couldn't tell them apart, according to Khan Academy, citing Kenneth T. Jackson's \"Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States.\"\n\nEach home in Levittown sat on a 6,000-square-foot lot, The New York Times reported.\n\nWith the growing number of children, outdoor spaces became increasingly important to the suburban neighborhood.\n\nAt first, they were modest homes, but most families saw their new suburban lives as luxurious.\n\nMany Levittown homeowners learned homeownership responsibilities, such as tending to a lawn.\n\nThe suburb helped cement the idea of the \"nuclear family\" in American culture.\n\nThere were also swimming pools that children could use during the summer.\n\nSince the streets in the suburban neighborhood were considered safer than those in the city, parents used to allow children to bike around by themselves, per the National Center for Safe Routes to School.\n\nThe mortgage on a home in Levittown was reportedly about $29 per month, while most paid $90 per month in the city.\n\nThe community has over 17,000 homes, making it one of the largest private housing projects in the history of the US.\n\nSuburban home construction boomed in the 1950s. In fact, at least 15 million units were under construction by the end of the decade, according to the Wealth Management Group.\n\nFor years, there were rules that restricted minorities from buying homes in Levittown, and even as the Civil Rights Movement was starting to take form and the rest of the country began integrating after Brown v Board of Education in 1954, Levittown remained mostly white.\n\nTwo-thirds of Levittown residents today are white, according US Census estimates.\n\nIn 1952, William Cotter, a Black man, and his family, sublet a home at 26 Butternut Lane. When the lease was up, Levitt refused to renew it or sell them the home.\n\nThe refusal sparked support for the Cotters, and the family eventually purchased another home from a white homeowner.\n\nThe suburban boom corresponded with the expansion of interstate highways in the US, starting the modern iteration of the commute from the suburbs to the city.\n\nIn 1950, 80% of men in Levittown commuted to Manhattan for work, The Guardian reported.\n\nWhen men left to fight in WWII, women began entering the workforce, gaining newfound independence and freedom. However, they were suddenly expected to give this up again and instead focus on childbearing and rearing.\n\nIn 1963, author Betty Friedan wrote in \"The Feminine Mystique\" that the suburbs \"were burying women alive.\" However, some believe that women's dissatisfaction with staying home \"contributed to the rebirth of the feminist movement in the 1960s,\" History.com reported.\n\nIn 1959, women of Levittown, with children in hand, protested in favor of putting stop signs in an area with automobile-related deaths.\n\nAs American politics increasingly centered on anticommunism and Cold War tensions rose, Levittown and suburbs like it took on a symbolic meaning in American culture, representing prosperity and the \"American Dream.\"\n\nLevitt was once quoted saying, \"No man who owns his own house and lot can be a Communist. He has too much to do.\"\n\nIn 2026, Levittown is still a sizable community with a population of about 50,000. Though it's full of modern businesses and technology, the community still holds a legacy as a post-war suburban haven.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe shortstop position is one of the top talking points surrounding the New York Yankees, as Anthony Volpe hasn’t been great. One proposed deal looks to address the position with a major shake-up.\n\nIn a mock deal from Thomas Carelli of Sports Illustrated, New York would land infielder CJ Abrams from the Washington Nationals in a swap centered on both MLB talents and prospect capital.\n\nNationals receive: Volpe, Bryce Cunningham, Prospect to be named\n\n“Yankees fans are absolutely fed up with Volpe. As for now, Jose Caballero is the listed starting shortstop. This is due to Volpe's injury, but still, not great,” Carelli wrote.\n\nFrom an offensive standpoint, Abrams is a lot better of a player than Volpe, but to say that he doesn't have his issues on both sides of the baseball would be a bit unfair, as he's good but not great.\n\nCarelli did acknowledge Volpe’s defensive value, but questioned his long-term position of staying in the Bronx. With Volpe set to start the season on the IR due to offseason shoulder surgery, there's a possibility that if Jose Caballero plays well enough, he won't have a place to play on this team.\n\n“Volpe can still be good — he was a Gold Glove. However, his time in New York is nearly over.”\n\nIt's unfortunate that it's gotten to this point, but if the Yankees are serious about winning, it might be better to do it now than in the future.\n\nNew York Yankees trade pitch lands another proven veteran and the price is cheaper than most would think\n\nAtlanta Braves trade proposal swaps Ozzie Albies with best hitter at position in Major League Baseball\n\nBaltimore Orioles trade proposal answers biggest question by landing right-hander who throws 100 MPH\n\nEx-Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer seemingly takes shot at MLBPA after latest news\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nFormer Yankees, Reds, A's outfielder agrees to $4M deal with Padres",

While Goldschmidt isn’t what he once was at this stage of his career, neither is Castellanos, and Goldschmidt doesn’t come with the attitude that the former Phillies outfielder does.\n\nWhile Castellanos’ power profile may have intrigued the Yankees on paper, there’s not much to say about him at this stage of his career. He also wasn’t content with his role and that’s something the Yankees shouldn’t have wanted to deal with.\n\n\"A lot of times when a good player has their role change with the club, it can cause some friction, and his role changed last year from where it was,\" Dave Dombrowski said. \"I mean you played every single day for a lot years in a row, and so sometimes that can contribute to it.

He’s one of the guys that will get here. But he’s had a good winter. He’s ready to roll.”\n\nStanton’s health has been a recurring storyline in recent seasons, making any positive offseason news a good thing as the Yankees prepare for the regular season.\n\nBoone also made it clear that, even with Stanton feeling well, the team will stick to its usual approach early in camp and try not to overdo it.\n\n“I don’t expect any limitations. I usually slow-play him into games in spring, so you might not see him that first week.”\n\nThat ramp-up stuff has been normal for Stanton, as it allows him to build himself up without getting hurt doing something that’s ultimately useless.\n\nIf the early outlook continues on, the Yankees could enter the season with one of their top power bats fully available, a key factor for a lineup looking to not only score a lot of runs, but also hit home runs and win the American League.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies almost got bailed out of Nick Castellanos situation by historic team in American League\n\nNew York Yankees almost made a $20 million mistake but decided to sign Paul Goldschmidt instead\n\nBoston Red Sox trade idea finally moves on from Triston Casas after two years of rumors\n\nNew York Yankees trade proposal sends Anthony Volpe to lousy NL team for 25-year-old All-Star shortstop\n\nNew York Yankees trade pitch lands another proven veteran and the price is cheaper than most would think\n\nAtlanta Braves trade proposal swaps Ozzie Albies with best hitter at position in Major League Baseball",

    "fullText": "Broncos have to be out on Breece Hall if Jets make predicted move originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos should make a concerted effort to upgrade the running back position this offseason. When they examine the free-agent market, the top name that should stand out is that of New York Jets running back Breece Hall.\n\nAs I have stated previously, Hall is the running back the Broncos should go all out to get ahead of the 2026 NFL season. He is a true three-down back; he fits what Sean Payton likes to do to a tee and he is still only 24 years old.\n\nHowever, his current team, the New York Jets, could foil any plans the Broncos may have of obtaining him.\n\nRecently, Adam Schefter of ESPN put together a list of players who could get the franchise tag placed on them, and Hall is one of those guys. Though the franchise tag doesn't shut down talks of a player moving on from that team, it makes it much more difficult to get them away from that team, and that was the purpose of the franchise tag in the first place.\n\nShould the Jets apply the tag to Hall, it would likely mean he would play at least the 2026 season with the Jets and it would allow the team extra time to come up with a long-term deal to keep him there much longer. If a team like the Broncos wanted to acquire him at that point, it would require giving up multiple first-round picks.\n\nIt would essentially end any thought the team may have of adding Hall to its offensive backfield. Instead, the Broncos would have to look at other options. Fortunately, there are plenty.\n\nWould Breece Hall be the missing piece on the Broncos offense to win a Super Bowl? | @TroyRenck@EricGoodman#BroncosCountry\n\nSponsored by https://t.co/ta6du3zyQx & https://t.co/7GdKA7T5Itpic.twitter.com/nWcwYPPDcz\n\n— Troy Renck (@TroyRenck) February 18, 2026\n\nKenneth Walker III was just named MVP of Super Bowl LX and Rico Dowdle is coming off a strong season with the Carolina Panthers. They are both scheduled to be unrestricted free agents. A more cost-friendly option, and one that would make plenty of sense, would be to grab Atlanta Falcons running back Tyler Allgeier.\n\nFinally, the Broncos could look at re-signing J.K. Dobbins and putting a lot of faith in him staying healthy. That would be a bit of a gamble, but the team does have options.\n\nMORE:Broncos not named as potential landing spot for Tyreek Hill following Dolphins release\n\nFor Broncos fans who were hoping to land Hall, they will have to hope that the Jets choose not to tag him. However, it would make sense for a Jets team that is looking to turn its fortunes around to make sure it keeps its best offensive player in the fold.\n\nBroncos may be getting an idea of cost for A.J.

The first — and Mamdani's preferred — relies on cooperation from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul: increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations, a cornerstone of Mamdani's campaign. Hochul has been lukewarm on the idea.\n\nWithout Albany's willingness to hike income or corporate taxes, Mamdani is signaling he will need to turn to other measures to fund his budget. He's floating increasing property taxes for the city's residents — which would hit the middle and working classes as hard as his typical targets on Wall Street — alongside drawing from funds that the city keeps in reserve in case of an economic downturn.\n\nMamdani called that option \"painful,\" and \"a tool of very last resort,\" and said that his administration would continue working with Albany to avoid it.\n\n\"This is a preliminary budget,\" he said at the press conference. \"This is a budget that reflects the only tools that the city has at its disposal.\"\n\nIf Hochul or Albany do not budge, Mamdani said he would increase property taxes by 9.5%.\n\nIn the press conference, Mamdani said the tax would hit middle-class New Yorkers the most. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on which income groups would be most affected or on the proposal's potential impact on middle-income New Yorkers.\n\nMulti-unit buildings — where renters tend to live — are taxed at a higher effective rate than single-family or low-density homes, where more affluent New Yorkers tend to live.

Drawing down reserves during a period of economic growth would leave us vulnerable to economic turbulence next year.\"\n\nThe proposal was blasted by US Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican whose district includes Staten Island and parts of Southern Brooklyn.\n\n\"Year after year, City Hall squeezes the middle-class for more by raising the property tax levy, and now Mamdani wants to raise the rate, making the American dream of homeownership less attainable and the cost of housing even more unaffordable for property owners and renters alike,\" Malliotakis said in a statement.\n\nMamdani's proposal doesn't mean that renters or property owners will get hit with a large tax bill immediately; as he stressed in his press conference, the budget is far from final. Hochul reportedly said at an unrelated event that she doesn't think a property tax increase is necessary.\n\n\"This is something that we do not want to do,\" Mamdani said, \"and this is something that we are going to utilize every single option to ensure does not come to pass.\"",

    "description": "I visited a huge toy fair in NYC to find the next hot new trend. Labubus are over. Next up for kids and the young at heart? The highland cow.",
    "fullText": "I'm calling it: If you haven't already, you're going to start seeing highland cows in toy aisles around the country.\n\nAfter visiting one of the industry's largest fairs earlier this week, I think I'm qualified to say: The shaggy cow is taking over as the hot new animal for plush toys.\n\nIf you've been paying attention to toys — or if you have kids — you probably already know capybaras are big, but they've been the hot thing for more than a year now. Same with axolotls, the eerily cute pink salamanders. Those trends are peaking, though.\n\nStuffed animals seem to go in trend cycles. In the mid-2010s, llamas and owls were all over baby and kids' clothes and toys. Before that, hedgehogs and foxes.\n\nNot everyone I talked to at the Toy Fair, the toy industry convention held in New York over Presidents Day weekend, agreed with my assessment. I got a few other surprising predictions:\n\nBut enough people I asked said the same thing — that the trending animal is the highland cow, with its caramel fur and tawny mop of hair — that I feel I can say there's a modest consensus.\n\nLike I said, not everyone agreed on the cow. But there was agreement, among everyone I talked to, about three things casting a long shadow over the toy business: tariffs, TikTok, and Labubus.\n\nI chatted with several small to midsize toy companies who said that the tariffs that began when President Donald Trump declared \"Liberation Day\" have hurt their businesses. One plush toy maker said they're paying $10,000 extra per container in tariff charges for their high-end plush animals made in the Philippines. They haven't raised prices yet, and the new fees just eat into their profit. Another plush maker said that they raised prices once after tariffs, but are trying to avoid another hike.\n\nToy makers' ears must've been burning when Trump made comments about how perhaps kids could learn to live with just a few dolls instead of many. But Trump was right about something — kids do often have more toys now than they did 30 years ago because toys are, in fact, cheaper than ever.\n\nThe rate of inflation for toys is well below the national average for all things, meaning a Barbie or Hot Wheel costs relatively less today than it did back in 1995. (If you're a parent looking at a mess of toys spilling out of boxes and shelves, you're not alone.) Part of the reason toys have gotten cheaper is overseas manufacturing, which the tariffs are now hitting.\n\nThe big toy brands like Barbie, Lego, and Pokémon all had new items to debut at the fair. Among the smaller toy brands, a few trends emerged — blind boxes were huge, and many brands and distributors had cute figurines packaged in blind boxes or adopted the aesthetic of twee characters sold alongside Labubus at the Hong Kong-based retailer Pop Mart.\n\nStill, no one seemed to think there was a clear heir apparent to Labubus, which were a singular meteoric event in the toy world (yes, there have been viral toys before, like Beanie Babies or Tickle-Me-Elmos, but the rapid internet and celebrity-fueled Labubu phenomenon feels unique).\n\n\"Labubu is such a great example of something from nothing, but really built on the foundation of everything. Blind boxes have been massive. Plush has been massive. It was the amalgamation of a ton of the listening, and it then getting discovered,\" said Eric Morse, VP of new business initiatives at Spirit Halloween said during a panel talk about Gen Alpha trends.\n\nMorse went on to explain they used a similar strategy for rushing out \"K-Pop Demon Hunters\" costumes this October after the surprise hit debuted on Netflix over the summer. (Of course, even though they pushed through a licensed costume at a far faster speed than normal, they still sold out well before Halloween, much to the ire of 8-year-olds everywhere.) \"How we view the business is listen first, execute second,\" Morse said.\n\nWhen toy and candy trends happen rapidly on TikTok, it can be hard to predict surges in demand. And with on-again, off-again tariffs, it's even harder to plan, lots of industry insiders told me. That's something I kept hearing from all the vendors I talked with: uncertainty.\n\nBut one thing I feel confident about is highland cows. You heard it here first, folks.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhile the New York Mets have taken strides in rebuilding their team after losing key superstars, they still haven’t addressed a couple issues. One of those issues is that while they’ve replaced the offense of Pete Alonso, they haven’t replaced his power.\n\nLuckily, a star New York’s been linked to in the past could fit the bill. Fansided’s Mark Powell and Wynston Wilcox believe the Mets should make a deal with the Minnesota Twins for their two-time All-Star Byron Buxton. Buxton is a destroyer of baseballs, and anchors the final spot in their outfield with a Platinum Glove.\n\nMORE: Proposed Yankees blockbuster trade sees New York land $100 million two-time All-Star to anchor outfield with Aaron Judge, Cody Bellinger\n\n“What do the Minnesota Twins actually gain from keeping Byron Buxton at this point? That's the biggest reason the Twins would trade him…Much like the Phillies, adding as much firepower into the batting order is necessary. The Mets had a disappointing 2025 season, fell short of the MLB postseason and now have to figure out how to contend in 2026. The Mets added Juan Soto last offseason as their big addition and now they need to replace Pete Alonso's bat. Buxton seems like the perfect option,” Powell and Wilcox wrote.\n\nThis past season, Buxton slashed .264/.327/.551/.878 with 21 doubles, 35 home runs, and 83 RBI in 126 games played. He’s a perfect replacement for Alonso’s power, and his defense is a major upgrade.\n\nMORE: Red Sox predicted to part ways with $90 million .282 AVG star outfielder through trade, make more room for Jarren Duran and Co.\n\nBuxton’s also only set to make around $45 million over the final three years of his contract, and for the big-spending Mets, that could be very attractive.\n\nHopefully, the Mets start negotiations as soon as they can; otherwise, another contender could swoop in and trade for him right under their noses.\n\nProposed blockbuster Pirates trade sees Pittsburgh finish off explosive offseason by landing $330 million two-time MVP, eight-time All-Star to replace Spencer Horwitz\n\nReds predicted to be dark horse blockbuster trade candidate for $330 million two-time MVP, eight-time All-Star after whiffing on Kyle Schwarber\n\nProposed blockbuster Phillies trade sees Philadelphia land $100 million two-time All-Star, Platinum Glove to replace Nick Castellanos",

    "title": "I spent 60 hours traveling on Amtrak trains from New York to Texas. Here are 10 things that surprised me most.",
    "description": "I took two Amtrak trains to get from New York to Austin. Here are unexpected things about traveling across the country in coach for over two days.",
    "fullText": "Local train rides can be slow and clunky, so I prefer long-distance ones — you can largely sit back, relax, and enjoy the journey because the stops are much farther apart.\n\nThe ride was smooth and enjoyable, and I watched the country pass by right outside my window, as if I were watching TV or a movie.\n\nSometimes I was so distracted by a conversation with someone else on board that I forgot we were moving.\n\nLong-distance trains are great when they run properly, but delays can be tough to avoid.\n\nAmtrak mostly operates on freight railroad lines, which means you're often at the mercy of those dispatchers.\n\nTo make matters worse, some lines run on a single track. So if there's an oncoming train, you have to wait on a track siding until it clears.\n\nFreight trains can cause anywhere from 10 minutes to multiple hours of interference.\n\nThese delays — which came every hour or so on my trip — interrupted the joy and relaxation that came with the otherwise smooth ride.\n\nSometimes passengers didn't receive announcements about delays, or only got vague ones. I wish I'd brought a radio scanner that picked up on the frequencies used by the dispatchers so I could stay up to date on the information or estimate the delay time myself.\n\nI brought enough of my own food for my two and a half days on the rails, and my short layover in Chicago gave me a chance to grab a hot meal.\n\nI also packed a reusable bottle so I could fill it up with tap water on the train. However, I was surprised by how many people depended on Amtrak's onboard dining options.\n\nThe café car is OK in a pinch: It has basic snacks, beverages, and hot foods like burgers and pizza.\n\nThe prices aren't unreasonable, but I still don't think they're worth it for food that generally gets taken out of a plastic wrapper and microwaved.\n\nEvery so often, the train made an extended stop at a station for a crew change or servicing, and passengers were allowed to step off for a bit.\n\nThere's no smoking on the trains, so I noticed a fair number of people using these stops as smoke breaks.\n\nHowever, I expected more people to take the opportunity to get some fresh air and stretch, rather than stay on the train.\n\nThere were only so many of these opportunities, and it was great to walk around, feel some sun on my face, and say that I set foot in a different place, instead of just passing through it.\n\nMy trip took me through more than a dozen states, including six state capitals and the US capital.\n\nThe trip from New York to Washington, DC, started out on tracks that were part of the historical Pennsylvania Railroad and continued down one of the busiest rail corridors in the country.\n\nThe bulk of my Cardinal-line trip went along old Chesapeake and Ohio Railway tracks. There was a lot of interesting history to learn about the railroad towns that sprang up along the tracks when they were first laid.\n\nMy trip through Virginia took me across tracks that played a vital role in the Civil War. The train also traveled through old boom-and-bust towns in West Virginia — some of which still exist, but others have only scant remnants.\n\nThe Texas Eagle is one of the few Amtrak trains that doesn't have WiFi, and some areas we passed through had little-to-no cell reception.\n\nThe Cardinal line also passed through areas with poor cell reception, which made the onboard WiFi quite unstable.\n\nFor this reason, I'm glad I brought an AM/FM HD radio with me. I had a lot of fun tuning in to different stations as my trains traveled the country.\n\nIt helped me feel more connected to the small towns and gave them more life. I found surprisingly good content in some remote areas.\n\nI came prepared for my train ride by downloading a bunch of TV shows and movies onto my laptop. However, surprisingly, the 60 hours went by so quickly that I didn't watch any of them.\n\nI only kept my laptop open on the Cardinal line to look at Amtrak's \"Track Your Train\" map.\n\nI was also having too much fun with the radio and didn't want to miss out on live broadcasts. Plus, I could continue fully taking in the sights out the window while listening.\n\nThe train was a very social place at times, too, so I was often busy speaking with the people around me.\n\nThe camaraderie I've experienced on Amtrak train rides is pretty much unmatched.\n\nI didn't get to talk with as many people as I have on past trips, but it was still enjoyable to journey together with a bunch of people for such an extended time.\n\nIt was great to see others get off at their destinations, but, in a funny way, it also made me a little sad to see them (and the ways they contributed to the train's atmosphere) go.\n\nGetting to spend time with fellow passengers from all over the world while different parts of the country passed by provided some true slices of American life.\n\nIt's great to switch things up by sitting and socializing in the café cars.\n\nHowever, the Cardinal and Texas Eagle trains have combined café and dining cars, so seating was very limited and only for passengers who purchased something.\n\nI missed hanging out in observation cars, as I've done on past trips.\n\nI knew this would be the case for my time on the Cardinal, but the Texas Eagle usually has an awesome sightseeing lounge with a variety of seating and viewing windows.\n\nThe fact that my train didn't have one was by far the biggest disappointment of the trip. However, the Eagle has since brought back its observation cars.\n\nIt's definitely worth checking whether your train has an observation car before booking a long Amtrak ride.\n\nWhen you spend enough time somewhere, it can start to feel very familiar and comfortable, which was my case on the train.\n\nDoing things like making room while walking in the aisle so someone else can pass, heading down the stairs to the bathroom, and refilling water bottles felt as routine as anything I'd do at home.\n\nThere was almost a weird comfort in walking around and seeing different parts of the train that became very familiar to me during my many hours aboard.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 9, 2021, and most recently updated on February 17, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Three-year NFL veteran and safety for the Cleveland Browns, Ronnie Hickman, was assaulted by a group of four individuals following a confrontation in the lobby of a Sixty Les hotel located on Allen Street in Manhattan, New York. The incident occurred at approximately 4:30 am after a group of individuals, who remain unidentified, approached Hickman shortly after he entered the building.\n\nAccording to the local authorities who originally spoke with the New York Post, police are actively investigating the matter, as well as whether or not Hickman’s status as a professional athlete had any influence in their decision to approach him. “The suspects slugged Hickman and took off,” the official report states.\n\nThe franchise itself confirmed that Hickman “was a victim of assault early Monday morning at a New York City hotel,” and a personal representative of the Ohio State product also informed the post that “Ronnie was treated for minor injuries at an area hospital after the incident, was later released, and is home resting with his family.”\n\nThe incident, unfortunately, comes right after Hickman had managed to enjoy a career-defining breakout. After recording just 70 total tackles with the Browns throughout all of 2023 and 2024, he managed to finally become a full-time starter in 2025.\n\nThe 2023 undrafted free agent tallied 103 combined tackles throughout his 17 starts this past season, snagging two interceptions and deflecting seven passes along the way. At this time, police have admitted that no arrests have been made and that all four of the primary suspects remain at large.\n\nStaff members who were on site at the time of the assault have also refused to offer up any sort of comments on the issue, but given the upscale nature of the establishment, it’s widely speculated that Hickman may have been profiled. The 24-year-old prospect is set to become a restricted free agent later this offseason, and will likely be resigning with the Browns for a “projected contract between $7 million to $8 million.”\n\nABC7 has suggested that Hickman was, in fact, identified by the four individuals, and that things only escalated after Hickman refused to acknowledge them, but that has yet to be confirmed by either official sources or any of the members in Hickman’s camp.\n\nThe post Cleveland Browns News: Ronnie Hickman Attacked by Goons in Sixty Les Hotel’s Lobby, No Arrests Yet appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "New York Mets owner Steve Cohen may have lost out on the Kyle Tucker sweepstakes, but he isn’t backing down from spending big on high-level free agents.\n\nAnthony DiComo, Mets beat writer for MLB.com, quoted Cohen admitting the Los Angeles Dodgers have built a high-level franchise, but he indicated he’s not intimidated.\n\n“They’re formidable,” DiComo shared on social media. “They have the ability to spend. So do I, by the way.”\n\nThe Dodgers have taken some criticism in recent years over their spending to acquire big-name free agents like Shohei Ohtani and Tucker.\n\nThe $240 million contract for Tucker in particular has renewed interest in a possible salary cap in Major League Baseball, which is the only major North American sports league without one.\n\nCohen has admitted he wanted to sign Tucker this offseason and was “annoyed” the team failed to land the prized outfielder.\n\nThe Mets also lost closer Edwin Díaz to the Dodgers, though they were able to sign infielder Bo Bichette, whom the Dodgers had targeted.\n\nIn an interview with Mets broadcaster Howie Rose, Cohen has made the case that the team ultimately is better off with Bichette over Tucker.\n\n“Frankly, once it was all done, and we got Bo to come to the Mets, (I) actually feel Bo might be a better fit for the team,” said Cohen, as reported by Tim Britton for The Athletic. “So I think things worked out for the best.”\n\nWhile fans and owners of other teams might feel like the Dodgers are bad for baseball, current players — even those who face off against the Boys in Blue regularly — love what the team is doing.\n\n“I f—ing love it,” San Diego Padre and former Dodger Manny Machado said of the Dodgers’ spending. “Every team should be doing it. …S— is f—ing great for the game. So I think every team has the ability to do it, so I hope all 30 teams can learn from that.”\n\nBryce Harper of the Philadelphia Phillies echoed that sentiment.\n\n“I love what the Dodgers do, obviously,” Harper said. “They pay the money, they spend the money. I mean, they’re a great team. They understand how to run it. They run their team like a business, and they run it the right way. They understand where they need to put their money into.”",

    "description": "I moved to New York City to pursue a career in fashion journalism. After a few years at my \"dream job,\" I felt burned out and had to redefine success.",
    "fullText": "Ever since I heard Taylor Swift's \"Welcome to New York\" for the first time, the city called my name.\n\nOf course, I was grateful for my suburban upbringing in California, but my town was too small for my aspirations. I wanted to live the life of a fashion journalist, and to me, that required being in New York City.\n\nFixated on my goal, I mapped out a plan in college to secure as many internships and part-time writing gigs as possible, then fling the industry door wide open.\n\nI went on to land a job at a Los Angeles public relations agency before breaking into editorial with a remote position at a lifestyle publication. Then, a few months later, I got a job at one of NYC's most prominent newspapers. It wasn't strictly focused on fashion, but it was my entry point.\n\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic meant I had to spend the first six months working from California, I was excited to move to New York as soon as possible.\n\nWithout knowing a single soul, I set off to the concrete jungle, armed with sheer ambition, nerves, and the belief that if I worked hard enough, I'd have that movie montage moment (cue \"Empire State of Mind\").\n\nI moved into an apartment on my own, and just like that, I was enveloped by the glittering scene that came with the gig, staring at my laptop until my eyes stung with tears and rubbing elbows with Hollywood's elite. It was a thrill, to say the least, but I still had my eyes on fashion.\n\nOne year later, I pulled it off, landing a role at the glossy I'd been collecting for nearly a decade.\n\nWithin days, my life changed: I was sitting front row at New York Fashion Week and juggling an output that seemed to multiply tenfold — making my heart race so fast my Oura ring began to flag stress spikes.\n\nThis new life shimmered from miles away, with friends and family saying, \"Your life is like a movie.\" By the world's standards, I had \"made it,\" but underneath the dazzling designer façade was a quiet truth no one had prepared me for.\n\nAttaining everything I'd dreamed of by 26 meant drowning in a sea of deadlines, navigating corporate politics, and feeling pressured to sustain my success — smack dab in the middle of a quarter-life crisis.\n\nThe increasing number of industry-wide layoffs also nixed the possibility of a promotion despite my best efforts. Still, the work accelerated and my responsibilities expanded. I was left feeling overlooked and depleted — and my mental health suffered.\n\nI began to question who I was apart from my career, if I wasn't climbing (and rising) to the top. What's worse is that this feeling began to seep into other areas of my life, feeding the lie that I didn't measure up.\n\nThat's when I realized \"making it\" couldn't be as simple as owning luxury handbags, interviewing stars, and typing up thousands of stories.\n\nInstead of feeling fulfilled, I was left with a strange ache that the life I'd worked so hard to achieve wasn't enough. So, I started re-evaluating how I wanted to live, my values, and where I saw myself in five years.\n\nI decided my next move would have to allow me to do what I love and still prioritize the other elements of my life that make me me: family, friendships, hobbies, and faith.\n\nStill, entertaining the concept of \"what comes next\" was unsettling, especially considering I'd up and moved my entire life just a few years prior, and I genuinely adored writing and style.\n\nI wondered whether pursuing something new would be a failure or if people would think I was weak. This inner debate gnawed at me for months, while work opportunities that once thrilled me felt like extra weight.\n\nBut finally, it clicked. Making a career change wouldn't be quitting or failing — I'd already clawed my way to the big leagues and thrived — and my purpose came from much more than my work.\n\nSo, nearly a year later, I left my dream job to freelance within the fashion space, deciding to stay within the industry and city I love — but on my own terms. Still, I'll always be grateful for the early years of my career; I couldn't have pursued my new path without them.\n\nAnd I know this won't be the final shift I make in my life, because it's the bends in the road that make it meaningful.\n\nAs it turns out, \"making it\" is a milestone that can be continually redefined, and landing my \"dream job\" was only the beginning of the story.",

    "title": "NYC's outgoing planner says Mamdani's proposed rent freeze must avoid 'pushing buildings into distress'",
    "description": "NYC's City of Yes policy, led by Dan Garodnick, aims to address housing crisis. Mayor Mamdani faces challenges in implementing affordable solutions.",
    "fullText": "In his four years as director of the New York City Department of Planning, Dan Garodnick oversaw one of the most sweeping changes to the city's zoning rules in decades. The policy, called City of Yes, initiated a collection of revisions to boost housing, including updates that allow new apartment projects to add bulk used for affordable housing, homes to convert basements or add backyard cottages as accessory dwellings, and more office buildings to be converted into residential space.\n\nMayor Zohran Mamdani won the election last year on bold campaign pledges to deliver solutions for a worsening housing and affordability crisis. Mamdani's promises to freeze rents, however, could further dissuade owners of aging rent regulated apartment buildings — who were already dealt a financial blow by a 2019 change to the rent regulation rules — from performing needed maintenance.\n\nMamdani's mayoralty will be a test whether politicians across the country can lower housing costs without destabilizing the landlords that build and maintain most of the housing stock.\n\nGarodnick, who will soon leave his post, spoke with Business Insider to look back on his accomplishments and offer advice to the new mayor. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe real estate community has not been excited about Mamdani. What would you tell them?\n\nI would encourage them to give him a chance to lay out his agenda for housing and economic development and make their determinations.\n\nWhat advice did you give him? Did you give him any?\n\nFocus on delivering results and making sure that the government can execute ideas at scale. And also that the city council is meant to be an active counterbalance to the mayor, and that is something he should embrace and to give elected officials the tools they need to be able to say yes to hard things.\n\nDo you think Mamdani will freeze regulated rents? Do you think that's the right move?\n\nYes. I think that's a top priority for the mayor, and I think people should expect to see that.\n\nI think it's an important signal to renters that the mayor is looking out for them and their interests. I also think it's important to strike a balance here and make sure that it does not have unintended consequences and push buildings into distress.\n\nLandlords of regulated buildings are saying their properties are falling apart, and they have no incentive to fix them. Do they need money from rent increases?\n\nIt's important that the city and state make sure that its policies not only protect tenants from unreasonable rent increases and abuse from landlords, but also that the living conditions and the health and safety of these buildings is satisfactory too. We need to make sure that we're striking the right balance here.\n\nAfter four years at the agency, how does it feel to leave?\n\nWe enabled through zoning changes in four years, more homes than had been enabled in the prior 20 years combined.\n\nYou have rules that were written 60 years ago that had the effect of limiting too narrowly where and how much housing you can build. It is no surprise then that you would see many neighborhoods of the city producing little or no house. City of Yes was designed to enable a little more housing in every neighborhood of the city.\n\nThe real estate community says that may be impressive, but it's still not enough to get housing built at scale.\n\nThere is no question that while zoning sticks around for long periods of time, there are other factors like the interest rate environments, the existence of a tax incentive, or even any single property owner's appetite for risk or access to capital.\n\nThere is often substantial pushback against ambitious rezonings. What does that say about the public's reception to housing development at scale?\n\nChange is hard, and people are rightfully skeptical. We focused relentlessly on clarity, plain language explanations, visual tools, multilingual outreach, and engagement with communities across the city. We met people where they were, and we explained how outdated rules affect everyday life and made the case that the housing crisis isn't inevitable.\n\nWhat is the political feasibility in your mind of dramatic solutions to the housing crisis, specifically large-scale development?\n\nWe wanted to strike a balance here that was historic in its scale, but also something that we believed we could build support for. That is always going to be a balance. I will note that the voters of New York City recently approved charter revisions, which will make it easier in some cases to allow for housing to be approved more quickly and shows that there's an appetite for the city, the mayor, the city council, to continue to take some big swings at this problem.\n\nWhat do you think those big swings will be?\n\nMayor Mamdani has been clear about his interest in creating more housing in New York City and has cited City of Yes as an important template to build on. As he's shaping his agenda, I would expect you might see some exciting new initiatives that continue to move the ball forward.",

In early February, the Celtics assigned him to participate in portions of a practice with their G League affiliate, the Maine Celtics, at the Auerbach Center. This included his first 5-on-5 scrimmage since the injury, involving rostered players, two-way players, and G Leaguers. Tatum described the session as the next logical step in his plan, noting he felt good afterward and emphasizing a focus on daily improvement without committing to an immediate return. He stressed following the structured progression to ensure full readiness.\n\nTeammate Jaylen Brown offered positive feedback recently, stating that Tatum “looks pretty damn good” based on what he’s observed during this phase. Reports indicate Tatum has ramped up activity aggressively, with no setbacks mentioned, and he continues individual on-court work alongside team integration efforts. Celtics president Brad Stevens has maintained a cautious approach, prioritizing Tatum being fully cleared medically and mentally at 110% before any game action.\n\nWhile a return this season remains possible, Tatum has expressed that he wants to come back at full strength, not as a diminished version of himself. Discussions continue, with no firm timeline set.\n\nCeltics’ Jaylen Brown Reveals UFC Aspirations",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants bolstered their offensive staff with the hiring of Matt Nagy as offensive coordinator, positioning him to guide second-year quarterback Jaxson Dart under head coach John Harbaugh.\n\nNagy, who previously coordinated for the Kansas City Chiefs alongside Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce—contributing to multiple Super Bowl runs—brings extensive experience after stints as the Chicago Bears head coach and earlier roles.\n\nDart, coming off an encouraging rookie campaign where he amassed 24 total touchdowns and just seven turnovers across starts, proactively sought insights on his new coordinator.\n\nESPN's Jordan Raanan reports that Dart engaged in multiple conversations with Mahomes about working with Nagy, emerging impressed by the feedback. During Super Bowl week, he also consulted Kelce, who offered glowing endorsements of his former play-caller.\n\nDart, fresh off a rookie season with 24 total touchdowns and seven turnovers, talked on multiple occasions with Mahomes about working with Nagy, according to multiple sources close to the QB. He came away impressed. He also told reporters last week that he spoke with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce about his former coordinator and received rave reviews.\n\nIn an exclusive Forbes interview, Dart elaborated on his enthusiasm.\n\n\"I can’t wait to get the chance to play for him. Just so many great things that are said about him and his coaching style and the work that he puts in, the passion that he has for the game,\" he said.\n\nDart praised Nagy as a \"quarterback guy\" who prioritizes putting players \"in the best situation and position to succeed,\" and tailors approaches to individual QBs. Dart noted Kelce \"didn’t have anything but tremendous things to say about Coach Nags,\" reinforcing positive views from Chiefs stars.\n\nNagy's scheme aligns well with Dart's strengths, with minimal expected adjustments from prior systems.\n\nThis \"loaded\" staff, including other ex-caches and coordinators, signals the Giants' commitment to Dart's growth as they aim to elevate their offense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Jaxson Dart spoke with Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce about Matt Nagy",

    "description": "A man who moved from  New York to Miami was prepared to feel lonely. He reached out to an old acquaintance for lunch and found a close friend to share retirement with.",
    "fullText": "Relocating to a new city is a mixed bag — especially when you're nearing retirement.\n\nWhen I moved away from home for grad school in 1990 at age 28, it was easy to socialize, since I was surrounded by classmates eager to make friends.\n\nBut in 2021, when I moved from New York to Miami for work at age 58, it was much harder to meet new people. The COVID-19 pandemic was still lingering, and I tried to connect with colleagues over a socially distanced lunch, but I couldn't really join clubs or meet neighbours. I found it hard to expand my relationships beyond work.\n\nI wondered how I'd make any friends, but later that year, I reached out to an old acquaintance and learned that it's possible to make good friends at any age.\n\nAfter arriving in Miami, I read articles about how to make friends as an adult. Some suggested rekindling old acquaintances. The logic seemed wiser than starting from scratch. I could reach out to people I already knew, or used to know even a little bit.\n\nI looked through my Facebook friends and LinkedIn connections for people who lived in Miami. I paused on Bruno's name because he brought back good memories. We had worked together seven years prior, when our respective companies collaborated on a project. I valued his ability to drive impressive results and radiate infectious positivity. He'd mentioned at the time that he appreciated how I kept the project on track.\n\nI hesitated to reach out. Our interactions had been friendly, but we'd only connected through work. Would it seem odd to Bruno to get an email from me after all these years? And was I leaping too far by suggesting a personal lunch?\n\nI swallowed my fears by crafting a friendly note, rereading it three times, and hitting send. The next day, Bruno responded warmly: \"Welcome to Miami. I look forward to having lunch.\"\n\nWhen the lunch came around a few weeks later, it went better than I expected. In addition to chuckling over old war stories about work, we discovered that we were both news junkies, avid travelers, and cyclists. At the end, Bruno said, \"That was really fun. You and your girlfriend should come over to our place for an Argentine barbecue.\"\n\nBruno and I started lunching roughly every other week. I was approaching 60 and itching to leave my job, and Bruno was already semi-retired. As someone on the cusp of a new life chapter, I valued having a friend at the same juncture.\n\nWe'd frequently talk about all things retirement, like the best investment strategies for our retirement portfolios, including how much risk to take and how many international stocks to hold. Discussions with a wise friend were much more satisfying than reading through reams of investment advice. We could debate, candidly admit our concerns, and test our logic. I became wiser and more confident.\n\nAs we grew closer, we discussed our hopes and anxieties about stepping off the corporate treadmill. I explained my desire, after decades of work, to release myself from the self-imposed pressure of always being productive. Bruno shared that he'd dealt with similar feelings, which made me feel validated. Our conversations gave me the confidence I needed to take the plunge and enter retirement in 2022, without feeling as guilty as I might have done about working less and enjoying myself more.\n\nSince I've retired, Bruno has been a valued companion. With no work schedules, we almost felt like we were playing hooky when we attended a weekday lecture by the Finnish ambassador to the US and took a day trip to see a touring Rembrandt exhibit. These post-retirement experiences are richer because I can share them with a friend who also enjoys exploring, joking, and giving his insights.\n\nI once mistakenly assumed that you can't form close friendships later in life, without the social intensity and openness of youth. When I first moved to Miami, I thought I'd make some acquaintances or group friendships, rather than forming any deep bonds. I was prepared to feel somewhat lonely.\n\nLast summer, Bruno and I escaped Miami's heat by flying to Upstate New York for a cycling trip. He fell on some railroad tracks, breaking his collarbone and ribs. In the emergency room, I whispered, \"Let's tell them I'm your brother, so I can stay past visiting hours.\" I sat by his side until his procedures were done at 4 a.m., keeping him entertained with the type of stories and gallows humor that only good friends share. We tried not to laugh too hard, so his ribs wouldn't jab him.\n\nBruno has since recovered and even bravely gotten back on his bike to meet me for meals again. During a recent get-together, he told me, \"Some people are really surprised that I found such a good friend later in life.\"\n\nI replied with a smile, \"What do you mean, friend? I thought we were brothers.\"",

    "description": "The former New York Giants head coach faced a backlash after discussing the intersection of child-rearing and football.",
    "fullText": "Ole Miss quarterbacks coach Joe Judge released a statement Saturday after a quote from a court appearance went viral, insisting that his comments about fathers of newborns prioritizing their sleep were \"taken out of context.\"\n\nThe comments were given Thursday during the hearing for Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss' request for an injunction to play a sixth season of college football. That injunction was granted Friday.\n\nOne clip of Judge's testimony took off in particular, in which Judge recounts telling the partners of players with young children that they need to prevent those children from waking them up in the middle of the night.\n\nNEW: Ole Miss coach Joe Judge tells pregnant partners of players during the season that the father has to play good football.\n\n“He needs to be in another room, detached… he ain’t waking up for midnight feedings.” pic.twitter.com/LQG7t0fQtX\n\n— College Transfer Portal (@CollegeFBPortal) February 12, 2026\n\nNotably, that clip identifies Judge as an Ole Miss coach and refers to unspecified players, but what it does not mention is the conversation at the time was about Judge's experience dealing with sleep disorders while in NFL player development with the New England Patriots.\n\nIn his statement, Judge clarified that the conversations about playing football while raising a child were only in the NFL, never the collegiate level:\n\n\"Some of my comments from Thursday have been taken out of context, so l'd like to provide some clarity. In a discussion about Trinidad's sleep apnea, I was trying to point out the importance that the NFL places on sleep for recovery and performance in addition to the education of balancing family dynamics during the football season.\n\n\"These are discussions I was a part of at the professional level from veteran players based on their own experience managing similar situations. These are not discussions we've had at the collegiate level. As a husband and father of four children, I understand those challenges first hand and would never diminish the commitment to family. We share that same dedication to family with our players and always support them through any challenges they face in their personal.\"\n\nJudge worked under Bill Belichick from 2012 to 2019, became head coach of the New York Giants in 2020, then moved back to the Patriots after his firing in 2022. He joined Ole Miss in 2024 and currently holds the titles of quarterbacks coach and \"head coach of offense\" (John David Baker is the offensive coordinator under head coach Pete Golding).\n\nIn the interest of clarity and not taking Judge out of context, here is the larger exchange about dealing with NFL players with sleep disorders:\n\nQ: \"Can a sleep disorder affect a player's ability?\"\n\nQ: \"Has that occurred in your past where you have encountered players with sleep disorders?\"\n\nQ: \"And what did you do for those players?\"\n\nA: \"Well, we got them the CPAP machines. We tracked their sleep. We made sure they were evening out their sleep cycles, that they're properly rested. That was several players over the course of years.\n\n\"And then there was also the players that we would have to educate — this is always a tough conversation to have. It's not a popular opinion, this is the truth, we would have to educate significant others who may have been pregnant during the season, or were going to have a baby during the season, and you'd have to educate them on — you have this baby in the middle of the season, that father has to play good football. It's a day-by-day production business. He has to be ready to perform and go out there and play, and when I say that is, you need to let him sleep. He needs to be in another room, detached.\n\n\"You have to explain to the mother, 'Listen, he ain't waking up for the midnight feedings. After the season, he's full metal jacket. You can do whatever you want with him, he'll change every diaper. In season, he's got to have a different priority.\n\n\"Now, there were examples to use from that. We had some older veteran players — I can or can't share names if you want me too — who had multiple children who would sleep in other rooms. Their wives would bring in family or a nursing aid to help throughout the night, and those players continue to play high-level football. We had other players who are young who quite simply did what every other father in the world does, waking up, changing diapers, doing feedings, and led to injuries, led to soft-tissue injuries, not being rested, not being recovered, not being ready to roll.\"\n\nQ: \"That never occurred to me, that newborns can affect injuries on the football field. But who had to deliver that message?\"\n\nQ: \"And to whom did you deliver the message?\"\n\nA: \"About as good as you'd expect (laughs).\"",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants are signing wide receiver Courtney Jackson to a reserve/futures contract.\n\nThe move comes shortly after the conclusion of the 2025 season, in which Jackson was a member of the practice squad for the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks. The 5-foot-11, 179-pound receiver provides depth at the position and potential special teams value, particularly as a return specialist.\n\nJackson, 24, began his college career at Syracuse University (2019–2022), where he appeared in 36 games and recorded 63 receptions for 662 yards, while also handling punt returns, including a touchdown. He transferred to Arkansas State University (2023–2024), playing in 26 games and totaling 81 catches for 1,183 yards and 9 touchdowns.\n\nAcross his collegiate career, he amassed 144 receptions for an average of 12.8 yards per catch and 13 receiving scores, plus solid return contributions (14.0 yards per punt return on 40 attempts and 20.3 yards on kickoffs).\n\nUndrafted in the 2025 NFL draft, Jackson initially signed with the Denver Broncos as a free agent but was released before joining Seattle's practice squad in August 2025. He spent the year there, earning a Super Bowl ring despite not appearing in regular-season games.\n\nThe reserve/futures deal secures Jackson's rights for the 2026 season, allowing the Giants to evaluate him during offseason programs. This low-risk addition addresses receiver depth and bolsters the return game amid broader roster changes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants sign WR Courtney Jackson to reserve/future contract",

    "title": "So long, New York: Why Bethenny Frankel says Miami is the 'new LA'",
    "description": "The \"Real Housewives of New York City\" star and entrepreneur, Bethenny Frankel, is among wealthy Americans to move to Florida from cultural hubs like New York City and LA.",
    "fullText": "The former \"Real Housewives of New York City\" star Bethenny Frankel built her public persona in the Big Apple, but after moving to Florida in 2025, she says the Sunshine State is the new cultural hub for America's rich and famous.\n\n\"Miami is the new LA,\" Frankel, 55, told Business Insider. \"In the way that LA was the cool place to be, and aspirational people wanted to be there.\"\n\nLast March, the reality TV veteran, entrepreneur, and social media influencer joined a wave of New Yorkers relocating to South Florida, settling on the coast with her teenage daughter.\n\nShe's one of many Americans leaving cultural hubs like New York and Los Angeles for smaller cities in the Sun Belt. A January 2026 Bank of America Institute study on US migration found that New York recorded the second-largest population loss of any US city in the fourth quarter of 2025, after Los Angeles. About 45% of outbound New Yorkers headed southward, with Miami alone accounting for 7% of departures.\n\n\"It's also cool to be in New York,\" Frankel said, \"but not as much as being in Miami, and Florida in general.\"\n\nAmong the Florida arrivals is a number of billionaires. Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Glenview Capital Management's CEO, Larry Robbins, have all relocated from northern cities to Florida's warmer shores in the past four years.\n\n\"Rich people are moving down here,\" said Frankel, who runs the private membership dating community The Core. \"Miami's exploded, real-estate-wise.\"\n\nData backs that up. Realtor.com's December 2025 Luxury Housing Report found that the Miami metro area had the highest number of million-dollar listings in the country, snatching a title that had traditionally been held by New York. More than a quarter of demand in the Miami metro region originated from the New York metro area, the report found.\n\nFrankel said the influx of new wealth has changed Miami's cultural landscape. \"It means shopping, art, nightlife, the real-estate cool factor,\" she said. \"Everybody went where the money is. The money is dictating what's happening on social media, and what's happening that's cool.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Lucia Moses reported in December that Miami is emerging as a hub for social media influencers. It had the highest number of top Instagram creators per capita of any US city, ahead of New York and LA.\n\nFlorida's draw in recent years, however, has extended beyond just billionaires and social-media influencers. Business Insider previously reported that differences in tax policy and cost of living meant that someone earning $150,000 a year could save roughly $50,000 annually by moving from New York City to Miami, largely due to Florida's lack of state income tax.\n\nFor Frankel, the move offered more than that. She said it has made her \"more social\" and allowed her to run her businesses from the \"sunniest and most beautiful-weathered place.\"\n\nWhile Florida has drawn in large numbers of domestic migrants since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Miami has begun to hemorrhage residents. The Bank of America Institute study found that Miami recorded the third-largest domestic population decline among US cities in the fourth quarter of 2025, with many residents relocating to more affordable parts of Florida, including Orlando and Tampa.\n\nIn Frankel's views, the whole state is having a moment. \"Delray, Palm Beach, Boca, Miami, the Design District,\" she said. \"Florida is on fire.\"",

    "description": "Wall Street's bankers, stockbrokers, and lawyers turn to New York City's tailors to look their best. Take a closer look at the businesses that dress Wall Street.",
    "fullText": "A custom suit is the signature look on Wall Street, and it's New York's tailors who keep the city's bankers, stockbrokers, and lawyers looking sharp.\n\nSome of these businesses have been city fixtures for decades, while others are newer arrivals that have quickly built reputations in the finance world.\n\nHere's a look behind the scenes at three of the tailor shops that serve Wall Street, and who owns them.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Alan Flusser's shop near East 48th Street and Fifth Avenue has been a fixture for Wall Street clients. Flusser designed the wardrobes of the iconic movies \"Wall Street\" and \"American Psycho.\"\n\nWhen Flusser retired in 2020, Sigmon, who had previously worked for Suitsupply, took the reins.\n\nHe described the house style to Business Insider as relaxed and \"guided by proper proportions meant to flatter the individual\" rather than trends.\n\nLS Mens Clothing on West 45th Street and Sixth Avenue is a family business that first opened in 1954.\n\n\"I've been doing this for 42 years,\" Zuber told Business Insider.\n\nIn his decades-long career, he's observed some notable shifts in styles.\n\n\"People are dressing thinner,\" he said. \"They're dressing thinner in the arms — even the conservative people, the business people.\"\n\nBefore opening Michael Andrews Bespoke, Andrews trained as an engineer and later worked as a corporate attorney. Required to wear a suit daily, he said he struggled to find off-the-rack options that met his standards.\n\nHe started having custom suits made, and went on to study tailoring.\n\nHe launched the business in 2006, and the flagship is store on Great Jones Alley in NoHo, between Broadway and Lafayette. The newer store is on West 20th Street, between Sixth and Seventh avenues.\n\nIt also has locations in Washington. D.C., Miami, and soon London.\n\n\"The vast majority of our clients are either investment bankers, finance guys, private equity, your typical New York finance guy, or lawyers who, to a large degree, service the financial industry,\" Andrews told Business Insider.\n\nIn 2024, Michael Andrews Bespoke employed three new full-time and two part-time tailors.\n\nRising demand for alterations led the business to hire a further two staff members in NYC the following year, bringing the total to four full-time and three part-time tailors in 2025.\n\n\"We've had dozens of clients bring back entire wardrobes,\" Andrews told Business Insider. \"For a couple of clients, it's 20 to 40 pieces that we've had to take in because they've lost 20 to 30 pounds.\"\n\nSigmon and Zuber also told Business Insider that demand for alterations, mostly take-ins, is growing as Wall Street clients' waistlines shrink.\n\nAs Andrews put it, \"the Ozempic effect is real.\"\n\nRead more about how GLP-1s are reshaping Wall Street.",

    "description": "The big NYC bitcoin bonanza drew top commentators in the market, who told attendees they see bitcoin set for a rebound later this year.",
    "fullText": "Where in New New York City can you see cowboys in snakeskin boots rubbing elbows with Patagonia hedge-fund vest bros?\n\nThe answer is Bitcoin Investors Week in NYC, the multi-day bitcoin bonanza hosted by tech entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano. This year's event kicked off in the depths of a bitcoin bear market, but the exuberance—irrational or otherwise—was on full display throughout the halls.\n\nAn abundance of bitcoin-orange ties and a jubilant mood were the vibes of the whole event.\n\nChris Klein, COO of crypto retirement platform Bitcoin IRA, insisted that the crypto community isn't worried about the current market downturn.\n\n\"Every eighteen months we go through something like this, so if anybody's been in this space long enough, this is the third or fourth time they've been through this,\" he said. \n\nSam Callahan, director of bitcoin strategy and research at digital asset treasury OranjeBTC, echoed the sentiment, saying that seasoned crypto investors remember bear markets much worse than the current decline.\n\nThe bitcoin bear market has dragged on for about four months now, with prices down as much as 50% from the peak earlier this month. They've recovered slightly but are stuck around $70,000, with no clear catalyst on the horizon. Still, for retail and institutional investors, the deep freeze doesn't appear to be souring the mood.\n\nMike Novogratz, CEO of digital asset investment firm Galaxy Digital, revealed that he's been buying more bitcoin recently in anticipation of shifting macro conditions and policy updates.\n\nCathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management, continued to describe bitcoin as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, adding that she thinks blockchain technology is poised to play a role in the next phase of the tech boom.\n\nAnd Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, one of Wall Street's loudest tech bulls, said that he doesn't think anyone can be bullish on tech without being bullish on bitcoin, predicting there will be more use cases for it in the near future.\n\nThe attendees who spoke with Business Insider on the sidelines of the event were equally bullish, donning bitcoin pins on blazer lapels and sporting orange ties in tribute to bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor.\n\n\"These conferences during market drawdowns are refreshing,\" Klint Drici, head of institutional sales at Arch Lending, a crypto-backed loan platform, said. \"They showcase the real builders and operators.\"\n\nIndeed, there were almost as many bitcoin entrepreneurs as investors at the event, boasting about projects they had in the works even as crypto winter deepened.\n\nEran Barak, founder of blockchain consulting firm Breem Group, said that he thinks the macro landscape is shifting in a direction that favors bitcoin, citing regulatory developments on the horizon.\n\n\"As the CLARITY Act moves closer to approval and Fed rate cuts are increasingly expected, funds and enterprises are viewing Bitcoin as a treasury diversification tool—boosting its perceived value as fresh liquidity flows into the market,\" he stated.\n\nMany of the crypto pros at the event didn't quite agree on when bitcoin might rebound, but all maintained that it should stage a comeback this year. Real estate entrepreneur and investor Grant Cardone, who spoke about his bitcoin investing strategy, told Business Insider that he thinks it could move horizontally in the short term before gaining fresh momentum.\n\n\"I think it could go sideways til the Fall or late Summer,\" he said. \"It could touch $40,000, could touch $38,000 and still hit $180,000 before the end of the year.\"",

    "description": ", Shariq Khan, Marianna Parraga and Arathy Somasekhar NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Valero Energy is set to buy up to 6.5 million barrels of Venezuelan crude in March bound for its Gulf",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Valero Energy is set to buy up to 6.5 million barrels of Venezuelan crude in March bound for its Gulf Coast refineries, making it the top foreign refiner of the OPEC country's oil ‌since the United States captured President Nicolas Maduro in January, sources said on Friday.\n\nWhat role is Valero playing in Venezuelan crude imports?\n\nWhat are Venezuela's current oil production and export levels?\n\nHow do recent U.S. sanctions changes affect Venezuelan oil?\n\nHow much Venezuelan oil revenue is under U.S. control?\n\nValero was among the first U.S. refiners to resume imports of ‌Venezuelan crude after the United States struck a flagship $2 billion oil supply deal with the country's interim government and began to ease sanctions. If Valero succeeds in snapping up 10 or more cargoes ​next month, equivalent to around 210,000 barrels per day, it could surpass U.S. oil major Chevron as the top U.S. refiner of Venezuelan crude.\n\nThat would also be the most Venezuelan crude oil Valero would process since the United States first sanctioned the country's oil industry in January 2019.\n\nChevron, the only U.S. major producing oil in Venezuela, is expected to boost exports of Venezuelan crude to some 300,000 bpd in March, from 220,000 bpd in January, sources told Reuters last month. Chevron typically refines up to half of ‌those exports at its own refineries, and sells the ⁠rest to other U.S. refiners.\n\nA large portion of Chevron's sales of Venezuelan oil to U.S. refiners typically goes to Valero. In March, Chevron is expected to supply Valero with most of the volume the refiner is planning to import, six sources said.\n\nValero ⁠has also negotiated some cargoes from trading houses including Trafigura, which were the first companies authorized by the U.S. government last month to join Chevron in trading Venezuelan oil.\n\nVitol has separately scheduled three naphtha cargoes to be delivered to Venezuela's state company PDVSA between February 22 and March 3, according to a shipping plan seen by Reuters.\n\nThe sources cautioned that ​loading ​schedules have not been finalized and are still subject to revision. They spoke on condition of ​anonymity to discuss confidential information.\n\nVitol and Trafigura declined to comment. ‌Chevron and PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA Valero spokesperson referred to comments made by executive Randy Hawkins after its fourth-quarter earnings release on January 29. In those comments, Hawkins confirmed Valero was in talks with authorized sellers of Venezuelan crude and expected it to make up a \"pretty large part\" of its heavy-crude purchases in February and March.\n\nValero, which has the second-largest U.S. refining network capable of processing Venezuelan heavy oil, had a long-term supply agreement to buy crude from PDVSA before U.S. sanctions.",

    "description": "A former high-ranking official in the New York Police Department has been charged with accepting $35,000 in cash, luxury travel perks and other bribes from a Florida businessman seeking to sell panic ...",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A former high-ranking official in the New York Police Department has been charged with accepting $35,000 in cash, luxury travel perks and other bribes from a Florida businessman seeking to sell panic buttons to the city’s public schools and police.\n\nIn an indictment Thursday, federal prosecutors said Kevin Taylor attempted to steer an $11 million contract toward the company, SaferWatch, while serving as the commanding officer of the NYPD’s School Safety Division. The company markets its product as a “mobile panic alert system” used for mass shootings and other emergencies.\n\nIn exchange, the company’s founder, Gene Roefaro, showered Taylor and his romantic partner with gifts — including luxury hotels and airfare to the Bahamas and Las Vegas, helicopter tours, tickets to Broadway musicals and a “medieval-themed dinner theater” — along with multiple cash payments, prosecutors said.\n\nTaylor pleaded not guilty to bribery and wire fraud charges on Thursday. An emailed inquiry to his attorney was not returned.\n\nRoefaro is also facing charges, including bribery and wire fraud. He has not yet entered a plea. An attorney for Roefaro said it was “puzzling and deeply concerning that the United States Attorney’s Office has chosen to pursue charges against Geno, while at the very same time, alleging — and seeking to prove — that he was the victim of an extortionate shakedown.\"\n\nThe charges are the latest allegations of corruption and favor-trading lodged against officials appointed by the city’s former mayor, Eric Adams, who faced his own indictment in a separate bribery scheme that also involved luxury travel gifts.\n\nWhile the case against Adams was later abandoned by the Trump administration, at least some of the probes into his inner circle remain active, including an ongoing bribery case involving his former chief advisor. In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have announced bribery charges against two other NYPD officers and a former housing official under Adams.\n\nThe investigation into SaferWatch first emerged in September 2024 as part of a sprawling federal probe into the Adams administration. The company was one of several to hire a consulting firm run by the brother of two top Adams officials, both of whom resigned after their homes were searched by federal authorities.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege that in 2023 Taylor helped secured a no-bid contract to pilot Roefaro’s products within the command center of the NYPD’s school safety division. But as the police official struggled to expand the program, Roefaro grew frustrated, at times describing himself as a “sugar daddy” who had “made a MAJOR investment and zero return,” according to the indictment.\n\n“It’s been fun, but it’s not fun or funny anymore,” Roefaro allegedly texted Taylor in late 2023. “Our company (ME) needs to report something real and significant that is in place prior to end of year.”\n\nDays later, Taylor tried to put together a press conference to announce his division would be procuring a tip line from Roefaro's company, prosecutors said. But that event was later cancelled.\n\nDuring roughly the same time, Taylor was also attempting to solicit $75,000 in bribes from two businessmen involved in a company that sold bullet-resistant vests to police, according to the indictment. Both men declined his solicitations, prosecutors said.",

    "description": "Trump abandoned his longtime home state of New York in 2019 amid multiple civil and criminal probes into his conduct",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Friday suggested that he could make his post-presidency home near a North Carolina military base instead of the gilded Florida social club where he’s lived since leaving his longtime New York home to avoid various investigations into his conduct.\n\nTrump was winding his way through remarks to soldiers at Fort Bragg that were little different from his usual political stump speech when he began boasting about the “billions” his administration is purportedly investing into improvements to housing and other facilities on the sprawling military base.\n\nHe also claimed his administration would similarly spend “billions of dollars” on improvements “here and around the area” to “make it great” because “people in this area have been so incredible.”\n\n“In fact, I'm thinking about moving here someday. Maybe I'll, maybe I'll move here with our great movie star ... with our First Lady,” he said, referring to first lady Melania Trump, who had also traveled to the base in a rare joint appearance with her husband.\n\nTurning to his wife, he said: “We'll move to Fort. Bragg. Would you like that, darling?”\n\nThe first lady, who seemed to be there as much to promote her documentary as to ride along on to Mar-a-Lago afterward, laughed and seemed to nod, at which point Trump resumed speaking, telling the assembled soldiers: “She loves you.”\n\n“It’s a possibility — actually, it's not a bad idea, because we love it,” he said.\n\nWhile the president’s remarks were made in jest, he does have some family ties to the Tar Heel State through his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native who has twice considered but rejected chances to run for open Senate seats there.\n\nTrump and his wife previously changed their primary residence in 2019, when they filed documents to officially shift their domicile from the eponymous New York skyscraper where he’d lived since 1983 to Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach, Florida mansion where he maintains quarters while using the gilded age-era residence as a social club for dues-paying members.\n\nAt the time, he claimed to “cherish” the Empire State, where he lived from birth through the start of his first term in the White House in 2018 but complained that he’d been “treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state” amid multiple civil and criminal investigations into his conduct there.\n\nThe first lady’s appearance alongside her husband — only one of a select few speaking engagements she’s had with him since his return to the White House — comes weeks after the premier of a hagiographic documentary about her preparations for his January 2025 inauguration that was purchased by Amazon for $40 million in what critics derided as a blatant payoff to her and her husband.\n\nAmazon also reportedly spent $35 million to market the film, which thus far has brought in just over $13 million in box office revenues since it was released in theaters last month.\n\nTrump referenced the documentary’s box office performance in his remarks to the troops, telling them that the United States “is truly blessed to have such a phenomenal First Lady.”\n\n“And now she’s a movie star,” he said.",

    "fullText": "She attended the designer's fall runway show wearing a high-neck halter gown made from gauze-like fabric.\n\nIt wrapped around her body, creating a subtle see-through effect, and its skirt extended into a short train.\n\nShe wore it with a fuzzy jacket that she carried around her waist.\n\nShe made an appearance at the Tory Burch fall/winter runway show wearing a preppy look from the brand. It comprised a white pleated skirt with a black, button-up blouse tucked in.\n\nUnfortunately, the two pieces sat loosely on Anderson and appeared too formal.\n\nHer leather belt, sheer tights, pointed heels, and black purse added some fun to the look, but the base layers were ultimately too simple for them to work.\n\nWhile entering the Ralph Lauren show, Reinhart was photographed wearing a brown tweed blazer as a top with a thick brown belt holding it closed at the waist.\n\nShe also wore a long black skirt covered in leather fringe, which added texture and contrast to the ensemble.\n\nHigh black boots and a small brown purse completed the fun, fashion-forward look.\n\nAlso at the Tory Burch show, Seyfried wore a golden, long-sleeved blouse atop a blue midi skirt with silver stripes. She also wore white heels with silver adornments and carried a blue purse.\n\nThe mix of two metallic shades with blue tones created a unique, fun color combination that complemented her hair and skin tone.\n\nOutside the Tory Burch runway show, the Olympic gymnast was photographed wearing an oversize blue jacket with a form-fitting wrap skirt in a vibrant red shade.\n\nThe two pieces were drastically different in style, and they overwhelmed her petite frame. They also didn't match the lime-green top she wore or her black accessories.\n\nThe \"Stranger Things\" actor attended the show in blue jeans, a button-up top, and a leather jacket that matched his sneakers and Coach purse.\n\nThe latter piece was especially fun. It featured a prominent pocket reminiscent of a coin purse and two keychains that looked like miniature books.\n\nMcLaughlin has been one of the best-dressed men at New York Fashion Week so far.\n\nThe model sat in the stands wearing skinny black pants with a billowing blouse. The semi-sheer white garment had a high neckline, balloon sleeves, and extra fabric at the waist that extended into a train.\n\nThe top piece was dramatic and memorable, while her pants were perfectly tailored to highlight her dramatically pointed heels.\n\nFor the Michael Kors runway show, the actor wore an all-white ensemble that included trousers, a loose-fitting blouse, sneakers, and a trench coat.\n\nThe outfit would have worked for him if it featured more than one color. Because the entire ensemble was stark white, each piece blended into the others, creating the illusion that he was wearing a baggy jumpsuit.",

    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — Bob Evans, the chain of family-style restaurants founded and headquartered in central Ohio, has a new owner.\n\nNew York-based investment firm 4×4 Capital announced on Feb. 4 that it has acquired Bob Evans Restaurants. The deal transfers ownership of the 78-year-old brand from San Francisco-based private equity firm Golden Gate Capital. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nBob Evans operates more than 400 restaurants in 18 states and employs more than 15,000 people. The company is based in New Albany and traces its roots to a 12-stool diner opened in 1948 by founder Bob Evans in Gallipolis, Ohio.\n\nDublin keeps Irish Festival ticket prices unchanged for 2026\n\n“We are proud of what we accomplished in partnership with Golden Gate Capital and excited to begin this next chapter with 4×4’s hands-on partnership,” said Mickey Mills, the restaurant chain’s CEO, who will continue to lead the brand. “Together, we look forward to investing in and enhancing our operations, guest experience, and brand.”\n\nGolden Gate Capital purchased Bob Evans in 2017 for $565 million. At the time, the firm split the restaurants from Bob Evans Farms, the brand’s consumer-packaged good business, which was acquired by Post Holdings for $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2022, Golden Gate explored a potential $600 million sale of the restaurant chain, though a transaction did not materialize. Reports in 2024 indicated the company had hired investment bank Kroll to oversee another sale process.\n\n“We are truly grateful to the terrific team at Bob Evans for their strong stewardship of this iconic brand,” said Neale Attenborough, a managing director at Golden Gate. “We wish the team all the best as they enter their next phase of growth.”\n\n‘Love is Blind’ fans buzzing over central Ohio ties\n\nBob Evans boasts itself as a farm-inspired, family-style restaurant brand known for breakfast offerings, such as its Farmer’s Choice Breakfast, and roasted turkey dinners.\n\n4×4 Capital, founded in 2018, focuses on investing in middle-market consumer goods and services companies across North America. The firm said it takes an active ownership approach aimed at accelerating growth and operational performance.\n\n“What truly sets the Bob Evans brand apart is its distinctive hospitality, welcoming ambiance, and fresh, flavorful food — delivering real value for the whole family,” said Gustavo Assumpção, co-founder and partner at 4×4 Capital, who will serve as executive board chair. “We look forward to partnering with Mickey and the team to maximize long-term growth.”",

    "fullText": "New York Jets fans have come to terms with the fact that Sam Darnold was better off elsewhere. The former No. 3 overall selection has done a fantastic job reviving his career since leaving the Jets. All of Darnold's hard work culminated in winning Super Bowl LX with the Seattle Seahawks this past weekend.\n\nDarnold has kept it classy at every turn when discussing his tumultuous tenure with the Jets during Super Bowl media week. The Seahawks held their Super Bowl 60-winning parade in downtown Seattle on Wednesday. As per usual, Darnold was faced with occasional questions about the Jets in the wake of winning his first Lombardi Trophy.\n\nOne particular question and clip has rightfully gone viral. Justin Fried of The Jet Press asked Darnold if he had a message to Jets fans who have continued to support him despite things not working out between player and franchise. Darnold provided the most heartwarming response imaginable.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Darnold started with. “I always look at myself and feel like I could’ve done a lot more for that franchise. The fact that [Jets fans] are able to support me even through that means a lot.”\n\nCongratulations to Darnold on winning Super Bowl LX!\n\nI asked Sam Darnold if he had a message to #Jets fans who have continued to support him:\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“I always look at myself and feel like I could’ve done a lot more for that franchise.”\n\n“The fact that [Jets fans] are able to support me even through that means a lot.” pic.twitter.com/AtOsbghHJN\n\n— Justin Fried (@JustinTFried) February 10, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Sam Darnold had the most heartwarming message for Jets fans",

    "description": "A New York City parent explains why she paid $7,500 for a part-time toddler program to ease separation anxiety before 3-K. She says it was worth it.",
    "fullText": "When I first found out I was pregnant, I frankly didn't put much thought into long-term childcare plans. Living in New York City, my husband and I knew we wouldn't have the traditional village available to us — my parents, while local and thrilled to get a first grandchild, are older and weren't particularly eager to volunteer for solo babysitting, while his parents live thousands of miles away.\n\nBut we were in a uniquely lucky situation: We both happened to have flexible, largely remote jobs.\n\nFor the first few months of my surprisingly generous parental leave, my husband and I, cocooned in newborn bliss (and perhaps slightly delirious from sleep deprivation), didn't stress about what would happen when I went back to work. I figured we could make it work through a combination of creative time management and strategically scheduled naps — at least until our daughter was eligible for 3-K, free schooling available in New York City for kids the year they turn 3.\n\nSurprisingly, this plan ended up working, for the most part, and for just shy of a year, we managed a fairly even 50-50 split in parenting duties. As time went on and my own work ramped up and the baby potato turned into a sprinting toddler, it became clear that my husband would need to become the primary parent.\n\nIt wasn't something either of us had considered before having a child, but it made the most sense: He found far greater fulfillment in being a father than he'd ever found in his career, whereas I had always defined myself by my work as a writer and editor. He kept his job but scaled back, working largely in the evenings and weekends so he could be free during the day for stay-at-home parenting.\n\nAs our daughter became a toddler, she blossomed under my husband's full-time care, with constant adventuring and frequent playdates keeping her days busy. We didn't need outside childcare — but as it turned out, she did.\n\nNew York City has notoriously high childcare costs.\n\nIn the interim between our delicate balancing act and deciding my husband would drastically scale down his work, I considered a number of different options, from traditional daycares (upward of $2,500 a month in my neighborhood for full-time programs) to nanny-share arrangements with other local families (maybe slightly cheaper, but a pain to coordinate).\n\nWe were lucky in that we were able to avoid childcare costs, which would have effectively canceled out one of our salaries, though I still toyed with the idea of enrolling her somewhere part time to get her used to the idea in case our situation changed.\n\nEnter Barnard College's Center for Toddler Development.\n\nI first heard about the program in a local moms' book club I'd joined. One of our first reads was \"How Toddlers Thrive\" by Tovah P. Klein, a prominent child psychologist — and incidentally the then-director of the Toddler Center. Another mom in the book club with a daughter two years older than mine mentioned she was now applying.\n\nI was frankly flabbergasted when she explained the details. It's part research program, where the toddlers are minded by teachers and selected students from the college's graduate program and observed for published research purposes from behind a one-way mirror, and part \"school,\" albeit an extremely part-time one, with each \"class\" of toddlers meeting only twice a week for two hours each day for the duration of the school year.\n\nI was intrigued by the program's unique \"gentle separation period\" and its said mission to help toddlers have a positive first school experience while supporting healthy social and emotional development through hands-on, child-guided play.\n\nAt that point, my daughter was only 18 months old (the halfway point to our 3-K end goal), but I'd already started to suspect that separation might be an eventual issue. With two working-from-home parents, she was used to having us around constantly — and had never had a babysitter.\n\nThe few times we'd tried to step out to grab a coffee and handed her to a grandparent, she would shriek like she was being abandoned. Over the next several months, she also grew more shy, coinciding with her stranger danger peaking.\n\nConvinced our future would be filled with school refusals and drop-off meltdowns, I hardcore pitched the Toddler Center to my husband for the coming school year. We didn't need it for childcare, but I became convinced we did need it to help give our daughter the gentlest, most gradual introduction to being away from us. He was less convinced, sure she would grow out of it and be OK with separating by 3-K, but agreed in the end.\n\nIf the program details were mind-boggling, the price point was eye-watering. Though there isn't a set, publicly announced tuition rate, the Toddler Center offers sliding-scale tuition and payment plans to make the program accessible to a broader range of the population. According to its website, a third of Toddler Center families pay tuition on a sliding scale (I assume the higher-profile alum parents like Amy Schumer, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Robert De Niro paid full sticker price for their kids to attend).\n\nAfter submitting a sliding-scale tuition application, which required forking over the previous year's tax returns to prove we were indeed not flush with cash, we landed on $7,500 as the final figure for our almost 2-year-old to take her first baby steps toward school.\n\nThe first few weeks of the program allowed the parents in the classroom, gradually moving us farther from it (a separate, no-toys-allowed room in the back, meant to be unappealing to the kids) to encourage the toddlers to ignore them and play in the main classroom area. That trick didn't work on our daughter, who simply sat next to the chair of whichever of us had taken her in that day, chattering happily as we tried to gently encourage her to go away.\n\nAs I'd dreaded, the initial actual separation — when parents would bring their kids into the classroom and tell them they were leaving — was horrendous. The Toddler Center mandated that only one parent or caregiver drop off their child each morning.\n\nFor the first few weeks after separation, we could both sit in the observation room, where we were treated to a front-row show of our daughter sobbing hysterically and trying to reason with the grad students to open the door she was convinced we were right behind. It was excruciating, and plenty of tears were shed on our end as well.\n\nThere was virtually no improvement for months, which was far longer than I expected. And I felt an immense amount of guilt for having come up with this idea in the first place: Were we actually traumatizing her instead of helping her? Had I epically miscalculated this? Did I pay $7,500 to torture my toddler and myself?\n\nI was wracked with doubt, and we debated withdrawing her from the program before the first semester had even finished. It was particularly hard on my husband, who, as the primary parent, was typically the one dropping her off and dealing with the meltdowns — and who also really missed her on school days.\n\nSuddenly, though, and for no particular reason at all, it got better. A lot better.\n\nInstead of sobbing by the door for a full hour and a half, she started interacting with the other kids. She found a favorite grad student she'd attach herself to. She played happily on the classroom slide. And eventually, she comforted the other toddlers during their hard separation days, assuring them their mommies or daddies would be back.\n\nWhile it was difficult for my husband to be apart from his little buddy for the few hours a week she was at the program, they turned it into an opportunity for new adventures. In the spring semester, he began biking with her to school, stopping to pick up flowers on the way there and back. Another tradition became that he would bring her a blueberry muffin from a local café every day at pickup. These small rituals helped them bond even more.\n\nI don't pretend to have a handle on the intricacies of toddler psychology, and I can't tell you what the flipped-switch moment was where it finally clicked for my kid that being left at school with her teachers didn't mean we were gone forever. And yes, for the record, she still cried during drop-off the first few weeks of 3-K.\n\nBut I am convinced that completing the Toddler Center program drastically reduced her adjustment period for \"real school.\" Tossing her into the deep end for six hours a day, five days a week, was simply not the right option for our family.\n\nIn the end, I'm glad I listened to my gut, dug into our pockets, and toughed out the tears — and I'd like to think my daughter, somewhere deep down in her toddler brain, is too.",

    "fullText": "There was a time I thought I'd spend the rest of my life in New York.\n\nAfter more than a decade in Manhattan, the streets felt like my own, and my identity felt entwined with the city.\n\nEven after having two babies on the Upper West Side, I was constantly plotting and planning on how we could make this lifestyle work long-term.\n\nAnd then, my husband and I stumbled upon our dream home in a distant Connecticut suburb.\n\nI was four months postpartum with my second son, and with two kids, I was no longer able to get the stroller down the three sets of stairs to get out of our building myself.\n\nThough I loved that my routine included walks in Central Park and my oldest had learned to ride a scooter along the Hudson River, I couldn't deny the appeal of a real backyard and a kitchen with an adult-sized fridge.\n\nThere were days when I swore I could feel the walls of our 750-square-foot apartment caving in, but could we really make the move to the 'burbs?\n\nWe both worked full time — I as a journalist, and my husband in finance. Even though our jobs only required us to be in the office two or three times a week, the distance was still daunting, and commutes would be at least an hour each way.\n\nPlus, what would it mean to remove ourselves from the city's vibrant energy? Would we lose ourselves?\n\nStill a little unsure, we decided it was an opportunity we couldn't pass up. On my second son's first day of day care, I dropped him off with teary eyes, and we drove an hour north to close on a four-bedroom home.\n\nWe gained more than three times the physical space of our apartment in the move, but the real gain was the mental space that opened up.\n\nOur day-care bill was almost halved. My kids traded in Riverside Park for their own driveway and a quiet street where they learned to ride bikes.\n\nI was no longer in a constant state of figuring out logistics or trying to find affordable ways for us to get out. We could invite people over to our house, we could barbecue in our backyard, we could even walk 20 minutes to the beach … for free.\n\nEven though we offset our day-care savings with our new mortgage, life felt undeniably more accessible.\n\nI felt myself start to breathe a little easier. I stopped constantly focusing on how to make more money and advance my career. For the first time in my adult life, everything we had was enough.\n\nThat same settled feeling that brought me peace in the suburbs also felt like a little bit of a loss.\n\nThere's a sense of anticipation in every conversation I had with friends in New York — anticipation for a shoot to wrap, for the perfect apartment to appear, for a deal to close.\n\nIt is a feeling built on ambition, dreams, and the shared experience of sacrificing a little bit of life's comforts to be a part of something bigger than yourself. That feeling lit me up when we were in the city, and connected me to my most creative self.\n\nLeaving the city meant we could no longer catch a last-minute Broadway show or easily see the latest exhibit at the Met. We had to consider job opportunities in a whole new way, and as a journalist, that meant accepting that I couldn't pursue certain roles that would require odd hours in the office anymore.\n\nHowever, most of all, I have missed the sense of belonging I felt before the move.\n\nOn the Upper West Side, I had enjoyed a spirit of communal parenting with my neighbors. No matter the weather or time of year, we were always out at a museum or a playground, meeting up with other families.\n\nWhen you live in such tiny spaces, your kids celebrate milestones at restaurants and rented spaces. You're all in it together.\n\nIn the suburbs, once the temperatures dropped, I felt everyone around me burrow into their homes and didn't see them again until spring. It's hard to make new connections when families aren't gathering at the beaches and playgrounds for large swaths of the year.\n\nWith more space came a greater distance from my peers, which made building a new community feel out of reach.\n\nThe energy of New York was the thing I loved most about it. It was also what exhausted me. Once we had kids, the life I wanted felt too far out of reach. The cost of living, too much.\n\nWith a move to the suburbs, our quality of life improved, and the air still feels more breathable.\n\nThe downsides are real — the commute is long, the proximity to our creative fields feels far, and I have struggled to find my community in a place that has felt more isolating than NYC.\n\nHowever, the tradeoffs are just as real. With more space came more peace, more stability, and more financial opportunity.\n\nWe lost some things in the move, but we didn't lose ourselves. And I like to think we brought a little bit of that New York spark with us.",

And when Phillips arrived in New York, he quickly realized the grass wasn’t greener on the other side.\n\nPhillips’ comments put the Vikings’ former captain back in the spotlight and raise questions about the Jets’ tone.\n\nThe veteran lineman told all this week, sparing his head coach, Aaron Glenn, from criticism but noting a markedly different atmosphere from his time in Minnesota and Buffalo.\n\nIt’s a story of the Jets being “the Jets.”\n\nPhillips spoke to Roundtable Sports on Radio Row last week, and he wasn’t shy about revealing the truth.\n\nHe said about his employer, “I think Aaron Glenn inherited a very cancerous, truculent group — whole, top to bottom. It’s not individual people’s fault. I was there for one season — it was a very difficult season — and I almost wanted to waver on some of my thoughts and my beliefs and my optimism.”\n\n“So, I can’t imagine being there for year after year after year after year and not seeing the results that you wanted, and it tainted people. Because my coach is going to get fired, my teammate’s going to get fired, I’m going to be a free agent, I might get fired, I have to play for me, I have to make sure my tape is hot regardless of what the system is asking me to do, what the scheme is telling me to do.”\n\nMany Jets fans saw the interview and thought, “Sounds about right.”\n\nPhillips added, “Then, young players come in and see, ‘Oh, that’s my vet, that’s how they’re acting, so that’s the way I’m going to act, too.’ It’s a long chain of things, and it can’t be fixed like that.”\n\n“I think AG’s mindset, of any coach I’ve been around, to deal with what we had to deal with this season and be as consistent as he was to us throughout that whole thing, was super cool to see,”\n\nUnless he’s released, Phillips can’t quite get out of New York; he’s scheduled to be a free agent in 2027.\n\nOn August 20th, ESPN’s Adam Schefter tweeted: “ESPN sources: Vikings are trading DT Harrison Phillips and a 2027 7th-round pick to the New York Jets in exchange for a 2026 6th-round pick and a 2027 6th-round pick, pending Phillips’ physical. Phillips now joins Jowon Briggs as the second DT that the Jets traded for Wednesday.”\n\nFans checked to ensure the tweet wasn’t from a parody account because — why would Minnesota trade Phillips?\n\nThe defense wound up ranking third in the NFL in EPA per play, so losing Phillips wasn’t a death sentence, but there were times throughout the 2025 campaign when Phillips’s run defense would’ve come in handy. Now, for their troubles, the Vikings will get a pair of extra 6th-Round picks, which, for all intents and purposes, nobody really cares about.\n\nIn the Twin Cities, Phillips earned respect as a team captain and tone-setter. He justified his contract by providing stability at defensive tackle when the Vikings struggled with inconsistency at the position. He steadied the middle of the defensive line when it sometimes faltered.\n\nOff the field, he became the organization’s most visible humanitarian, consistently investing time and resources into community work. Over 51 games in Minnesota, the 29-year-old recorded 207 tackles, 17 quarterback hits, and 6.5 sacks, also serving as a cultural pillar in the locker room.\n\nPhillips personally played well in New York last season — go figure — but his team stunk. Utterly stunk. The Jets started 0-7, basically eliminating themselves from postseason contention by Halloween, and finished the campaign with a horrid 3-14 record.\n\nIn recent weeks, Glenn has fired almost all of his coaching staff, so whatever culture he hoped to fix per the cancerous Phillips observation will start from scratch in 2026.\n\nPhillips banked a 72.5 grade from Pro Football Focus. He did his part. It’s also worth noting that Phillips, until 2025, spent his entire career with the Bills and Vikings. Playing for a bottom-feeder was new territory — that he evidently didn’t enjoy.\n\nWhat’s Next for Phillips & the Jets?\n\nPhillips can escape from New York next offseason, and he’ll be 31 when it’s time to sign his next contract. Unless the Jets trade him in the upcoming months, he’s stuck contractually.\n\nFor the Jets’ overall outlook, well, they’re in a familiar spot. They need a quarterback. Justin Fields and Tyrod Taylor held down the fort in 2025, but all that led to was a 3-14 record. In the coming weeks and months, New York can pursue a passer via trade like Mac Jones or Kyler Murray, sign Malik Willis from free agency, or explore the draft for a signal-caller like Ty Simpson, Carson Beck, or Trinidad Chambliss.\n\nNew York has the third-lowest Super Bowl odds for next year, with a +20000 moneyline, only besting the Miami Dolphins and Arizona Cardinals.",

    "description": "The New York Times argued that it was \"time to acknowledge reality\" and \"admit\" that the United States has a \"marijuana problem\" in a new editorial.",
    "fullText": "The New York Times argued that it was “time to acknowledge reality” and “admit” that the United States has a “marijuana problem” in a new editorial admitting that the legalization of weed in most states has had a wide variety of adverse consequences.\n\n“This editorial board has long supported marijuana legalization. In 2014, we published a six-part series that compared the federal marijuana ban to alcohol prohibition and argued for repeal. Much of what we wrote then holds up — but not all of it does,” began the Times. “At the time, supporters of legalization predicted that it would bring few downsides. In our editorials, we described marijuana addiction and dependence as ‘relatively minor problems.’ Many advocates went further and claimed that marijuana was a harmless drug that might even bring net health benefits. They also said that legalization might not lead to greater use.”\n\n“It is now clear that many of these predictions were wrong. Legalization has led to much more use. Surveys suggest that about 18 million people in the United States have used marijuana almost daily (or about five times a week) in recent years. That was up from around six million in 2012 and less than one million in 1992. More Americans now use marijuana daily than alcohol,” it acknowledged. “This wider use has caused a rise in addiction and other problems. Each year, nearly 2.8 million people in the United States suffer from cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, which causes severe vomiting and stomach pain. More people have also ended up in hospitals with marijuana-linked paranoia and chronic psychotic disorders. Bystanders have also been hurt, including by people driving under the influence of pot.”\n\nInstead of calling for a total rollback that would recriminalize the sale and use of the drug, the Gray Lady advocated a policy of “grudging toleration” that might upset “Big Weed,” which, it argues has “a financial incentive to mislead the public about what they are selling.”\n\n“Marijuana companies, not casual smokers, are the biggest winners of Mr. Trump’s decision to reclassify the drug from Schedule I to Schedule III. The change will increase the profits of these businesses by causing the tax code to treat them more favorably. This does not qualify as grudging toleration,” it submitted before concluding: “The unfortunate truth is that the loosening of marijuana policies — especially the decision to legalize pot without adequately regulating it — has led to worse outcomes than many Americans expected. It is time to acknowledge reality and change course.”\n\nThe post ‘Time to Acknowledge Reality’: The New York Times Warns America Has a ‘Marijuana Problem’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

The unit returned to playing up to traditional Giants standards, earning praise for its improved performance despite limited wins.\n\nBullen described serving as DC as a \"great honor and privilege,\" focusing on hard work and player development rather than external validation. His success drew widespread interest, including prior interview requests from the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals.\n\nUnder new Giants head coach John Harbaugh, Bullen was retained on staff -- amid a broader coaching purge -- but primarily as outside linebackers coach.\n\nTeams cannot block promotional interviews, positioning Bullen as a rising candidate for full-time coordinator opportunities.

    "description": "A super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and other tech leaders has targeted New York Assembly member Alex Bores' congressional campaign, marking its first attack against a lawmaker supporting AI regulation.",
    "fullText": "A pro-AI super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman has chosen New York Assembly member Alex Bores — and his congressional bid — as its first target.\n\nThe PAC, dubbed Leading the Future, formed in August with a more than $100 million commitment to support policymakers with a light-touch — or a no-touch — approach to AI regulation. And that means going after policymakers who want to regulate AI. The super PAC has backing from a number of other prominent leaders in tech, including Palantir co-founder and 8VC managing partner Joe Lonsdale as well as AI search engine Perplexity.\n\n“I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it,” Bores told a room of journalists Monday evening at a Journalism Workshop on AGI impacts and governance in Washington, D.C. “When they say, ‘Hey, we’re going to spend millions against Alex because he might regulate Big Tech and put basic guardrails on AI,’ I just basically forward that to my constituents.”\n\nBores, who’s running to represent the state’s 12th Congressional District, said AI anxieties are on the rise among his constituents, who worry about everything from data centers pushing up utility bills and worsening climate change to chatbots impacting kids’ mental health and automation transforming the job market.\n\nBores is the chief sponsor of New York’s bipartisan RAISE Act, which requires large AI labs to have a safety plan in place to prevent critical harms, follow their own safety plan, and disclose critical safety incidents, like bad actors stealing an AI model. The bill also prohibits AI firms from releasing models with unreasonable risks of critical harm and imposes civil penalties of up to $30 million if companies fail to live up to these standards. The legislation is currently awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature.\n\nBores said while drafting and redrafting the bill, he consulted with the large AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. Those negotiations led to the removal of provisions like third-party safety audits, which he says the industry refused to accept. Nevertheless, the RAISE Act, and Bores himself, appears to have incurred the ire of Silicon Valley.\n\nZac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, heads of Leading the Future, told Politico that they would work on a multibillion-dollar effort to sink Bores’ campaign.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch, they accused Bores of advancing “ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation.” The pair said “bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.”\n\n“The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,” Moffatt and Vlasto said in the emailed statement. “America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users.”\n\nMany in Silicon Valley have pushed to prohibit states from passing regulation that relates to AI. Earlier this year, a provision blocking state AI laws was slipped into the federal budget bill and was later removed. Now, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz are seeking to resurrect it through other legislative avenues.\n\nBores said he is concerned such a movement could continue to gain legs at a time when the federal government has passed no meaningful AI regulation. Where federal government moves slow, states are like startups — they can function as policy laboratories and move fast to test what works.\n\n“The question should be, has Congress solved the problem?” Bores said. “If Congress solves the problem, then it can tell the states to get out of the way, but if they’re not going to pass a bill that’s actually addressing any of the problems…and then [saying that states can’t do anything] that just doesn’t make sense to me.”\n\nBores also noted he has been in contact with policymakers in other states to work on standardizing legislation, which could combat Silicon Valley’s “patchwork” objection. He also believes that lawmakers should ensure there are no redundancies with the EU AI Act.\n\nBores emphasized that AI regulation isn’t meant to limit innovation, and that he has rejected bills that he thinks would have unintended consequences for the industry.\n\n“Having basic rules of the road, literal or metaphorical, is actually a very pro-innovation stance if done well,” Bores said. “I fundamentally believe that the AI that wins is going to be the AI that is trustworthy. And the pushback from industry to say that government has no role in establishing that trust is one that I think you’re seeing people reject at every level.”",

    "fullText": "Black and trans drag performers are crowdfunding to survive in one of the most expensive cities in the world.\n\nAfter he somersaults on the bar in six-inch stilettos and a blood-stained, Chucky’s-bride-themed white corset, the crowd at Bushwick’s queer-owned Pink Metal Bar roars in delight for Xaddy Addy, a Black transmasculine drag king and sideshow performer. The audience has gathered in the intimate bar for Superstar Open Set’s Halloween show, an open stage that Xaddy Addy cohosts each week alongside drag performer Pachacvnti. After a night of performances from Brooklyn’s emerging talent, the crowd remains spellbound as Xaddy Addy staples cash tips to his cheeks, thighs, and hips. Not even the loud cheering drowns out the clack of the staple gun as it pierces his skin. His self-assured, “weird” drag performance—an expansive genre melding drag with horror, stunts, and complex dramaturgy—belies the economic insecurity and discrimination he faced while building a following.\n\nManhattan native Xaddy Addy tells me that drag was “a way to save his life” after years of doing sex work “100 percent out of survival.” For many, drag is both a calling and an art form—one that contributes to New York’s $35 billion nightlife economy. But income from their performances barely covers their bills in one of the most expensive cities in the world, where the average rent soars beyond $3,000. Many Black and trans performers are crowdfunding on social media to cover rent, medical bills, and groceries.\n\n“You have some of the best Black trans drag performers in the world in your city,” says Klondyke, a Black drag artist and sideshow performer. “Why are they starving? Why am I seeing more people that are Black and trans posting mutual aid than posting shows that they’re in?”\n\nWith the election of Mayor Zohran Mamdani, drag artists are hopeful about his promises to make the city more affordable, by freezing rent for stabilized housing, and to expand protections for trans New Yorkers. But they argue that policy changes alone will not be enough to undo decades of decisions that have disenfranchised the city’s marginalized residents. That will take all of us.\n\nDrag performance artists occupy a precarious ledge in New York’s gentrified landscape. The city’s exorbitant costs of living, along with Trump’s despotic policies, have caused residents and tourists to opt out of live entertainment. “I can’t tell you how many shows I’ve been a part of that have been well promoted, the promo’s gorgeous, the cast is posting, the tickets are not too expensive,” Bri Joy, a drag king and go-go dancer, says. “All the conditions are correct for a beautiful day at the beach, and then no one shows up at the beach.”\n\nBut Black and brown artists have faced decades of discrimination over the years, long before Donald Trump kicked off his crusade against trans people. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Afrosephone, a showgirl from New York, remembers, “the girls and the dolls went to work” across swaths of Manhattan—from the West Side Piers to the iconic La Escuelita on West 39th Street. By contrast, white venues permitted Black or Latine people only on designated nights. These clubs “were a thousand times worse back then,” Afrosephone says, “where they could be openly racist to you.” Black and brown artists forged their own spaces underground, and their contributions to nightlife attracted tourists, a new generation of queer transplants, and, inevitably, the cops.\n\nIn response to the proliferation of underground clubbing, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani disproportionately raided Black and brown clubs for dancing, smoking, or playing loud music. He also wiped the dust off the Prohibition-era Cabaret Law, which outlaws dancing in venues without a pricey cabaret license. Giuliani’s policies, ostensibly aimed to reduce crime, sought to attract wealthy transplants and business owners to the city. Mayor Mike Bloomberg continued these draconian measures into the early 2010s. A long battle with the NY State Liquor Authority ended in La Escuelita’s untimely closing in 2016, only a year before Mayor Bill de Blasio finally repealed the Cabaret Law.\n\nThe NYPD’s crusade on Black and brown clubs robbed performers of cultural sanctuary and employment options. Real estate developers and culture-hungry newcomers flocked to pick at the ruins. Venue owners and event producers shut Black performers out of regimented clubs, where partygoers shuffled into VIP sections, hardly danced, and snapped photos of ostentatious bottle service. Today, Black and trans artists continue to face discriminatory hiring practices.\n\nBri Joy says that many promoters adhere to the “paper bag test”—if a drag performer’s skin is darker than a paper bag, then they’re turned away from certain clubs. Trans artists face compounded scrutiny from audiences and other drag performers, who have asked Bri Joy probing questions like “What kind of trans are you?” and outed Afrosephone on stage without her consent.\n\n“Even now, especially in Manhattan, there can only be one or two top Black performers at a time,” Afrosephone says. “We’re at the mercy of these establishments that don’t truly want to work with us.”\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio’s relatively progressive policy decisions led to ephemeral gains for drag artists. Along with expanding labor rights and housing protections, de Blasio founded the Office of Nightlife (ONL) to support workers and local business development after dark.\n\nWhen Covid restrictions were lifted in 2021, Klondyke recalls that “a lot of corporate and white money” was being “thrown at drag” programs. Diverse drag lineups attracted audiences who toted stimulus checks and a nascent, if not fleeting, solidarity with people of color after the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020. “I was doing at least three or four shows a week for over a year, and that was able to sustain me,” Klondyke says. “Then it just starts to fizzle.” Once the news cycle closed the chapter on racial justice, so did the city’s doors and wallets.\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Michael Kazin\n\nEric Adams pledged to revive the nightlife economy when he was elected mayor in 2022. During his term, he frequently appeared at swanky Midtown venues where he dined on branzino with his inner circle, including convicted fraudsters and former Governor Andrew Cuomo—whose tenure saw steep increases in housing costs and a decline in the number of Black residents.\n\nThe New York City Council sued Adams for blocking legislation to offer more housing vouchers and recently overruled his proposal to hike Section 8 rents. His $650 million campaign to combat street homelessness raises questions about the plan’s execution, given that his former policies led to increased policing in subway stations and forced displacements of unhoused people.\n\nAdams, to his credit, led the transition from Giuliani’s authoritarian MARCH program, in which police cracked down on clubs without warning, to CURE, an initiative that mediates nightlife violations before resorting to harsh police enforcement. While these measures bridge the gap between city government and nightlife venues, Adams’ administration failed to meaningfully address the most pertinent threats to nightlife workers: housing insecurity and finding safe, steady work.\n\n“There have been one or two times where I’ve had a bout of unemployment and I’ve tried to make it work with just nightlife,” says Bri Joy. “I owed so much back rent and I was the brokest I’d ever been in my life. It was the first time that I’d really seen my account hit actual zero.”\n\nEven New York’s “Freelance Isn’t Free” law, which protects freelancers’ rights, requires written contracts only for projects of $800 or more with a single employer. But underground drag artists often earn up to a couple hundred dollars from gigs, if they’re paid at all, and recurring bookings are difficult to come by. In August 2024, the ONL reported that its efforts to expand affordability for DIY spaces were “currently on hold”—despite the fact that increased access to venues would help drag performers and producers like Vague Static create more employment opportunities.\n\n“It’s gonna be a lot easier a lot of the time for a white producer to get into the clubs, to produce a thing, and pay the people,” says Vague Static. They are a co-organizer of Lil’ Park Drag Show, a free program that took a hiatus this year following a spike in transphobic safety threats. “I do not have the money to pay the people for their time.”\n\nA 2019 ONL study reports that income stability and gig competition pose substantial hurdles to 80 percent of nightlife entertainers, and drag is especially cutthroat. Individualism, prejudice, and poor conflict resolution within the drag community—even among other LGBTQ+ people of color—widen the gaps of public policy failures.\n\nDrag kings in particular are disregarded and underpaid compared to drag queens and well-known entertainers, who use “words like community and friendship to get close to you,” only to disappear when they find “a better booking,” according to Klondyke. These discrepancies have material consequences. In January, after Klondyke failed to secure consistent work and accumulated $10,000 in unpaid rent, his landlord evicted him and his partner from their Brooklyn apartment. “Our income is very sporadic,” reads Klondyke’s fundraiser for housing costs. “We are at the end of our rope.” Although Klondyke began fundraising in 2024, his campaign is still less than halfway to its goal, and his search for secure housing wears on.\n\n“When you become silent, you fall into the similar categories of the rising conservatism that we see in this country,” Xaddy Addy says. “People are left to feel alone and invisible and think to themselves, what does it even mean to be in these spaces? What does it even mean to exist in this life?”\n\nFor as long as Black trans artists have existed in New York City, they have addressed their uncertain living situations with community-based solutions. In 1968, drag queen Crystal LaBeija created the House of LaBeija—an artist-led collective that offered mentorship and support networks to Black trans talent—to resist the racial discrimination she faced in ballroom pageants, where women of color lightened their faces to compete for white judges only to lose to non-Black talent. LaBeija’s house system was the first of its kind, not only launching drag to international acclaim but offering a blueprint for how drag artists can support each other in moments of need. “There would be no ballroom or drag culture without Crystal LaBeija,” says Afrosephone.\n\nDuring the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, performers relied on drag collectives, where drag artists shared costumes, exchanged industry knowledge, and hosted in-person events like “Takes the Cake,” “a drag competition for drag king, things, and other non-binary & queer performers.” Klondyke, who “came up in the time of collectives” and won Takes the Cake in 2021, recalls the electrifying presence these opportunities carried, “especially for kings and things,” who were “excited to have spaces to do our thing.”\n\nThe Cake Boys, the drag collective behind Takes the Cake, had to shutter their live event programming in 2024, but other underground initiatives have sprouted up to fulfill drag artists’ needs. More recently, Klondyke and Xaddy Addy cofounded Black Cherry Sideshow, the first-ever trans and BIPOC-led drag sideshow, alongside drag artists Selena Surreal and Oliver Herface. The quartet performs every second Saturday of the month at Purgatory Bar in Bushwick, where they engage in a dizzying range of stunts like eating fire, lying on beds of nails, and taking needles and mouse traps to their bare flesh. With an historic one-year anniversary event held last May on Coney Island, Black Cherry Sideshow dares to reimagine the sideshow not as an exploitative spectacle for white consumption but a way for trans performers of color to reclaim their power and, according to Xaddy Addy, “raise the stakes in my drag in a dangerous but safe way.” Along with his sideshow grind, both Xaddy Addy and Afrosephone host open sets to uplift up-and-coming drag artists, while others circulate calls for mutual aid.\n\n“Being a drag performer, I’d much rather [use] art to fight through a fascist system instead of making art to appease a fascist system,” Klondyke says. “The fact that my art is able to exist as a Black trans person is what is political.”\n\nDrag is inextricable from the city’s anti-fascist future. Zohran Mamdani’s use of relationship-building, volunteerism, and media to build power mirrors the tactics of Black and trans-led collectives throughout New York’s history.\n\nSo far, Mamdani has acted on some of his campaign promises and fallen short on others. Although Mamdani called to defund the “racist and anti-queer” NYPD on X in 2020, he roused criticism from progressives after choosing to retain Jessica Tisch, a moderate who increased surveillance across the city and opposes bail reform efforts, as the NYPD commissioner. The decision to maintain Eric Adams’s pro-NYPD appointment, along with his delayed, lackluster response to two fatal police shootings days into his term, cast suspicion over whether he’ll follow through on his pledge to protect New Yorkers who are most vulnerable to police violence.\n\nHe has made more hopeful strides in the realm of nightlife and entertainment, where he elected Freelancers Union leader Rafael Espinal as commissioner of the New York City Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment. Espinal led the charge to repeal the Cabaret Law and pass the Freelance Isn’t Free Act as a city councillor under Bill de Blasio. The native Brooklynite’s track record of inclusive policy reforms, along with his recent promises to expand affordability for NYC creatives, seek to meaningfully address the cost-of-living catastrophe that worsened under Adams’ administration.\n\nYet policy changes alone are never enough. True power, as Mamdani even emphasized on his campaign trail, lies in the hands of the people.\n\nNew Yorkers have a responsibility to show up and stand down for nightlife performers by attending drag shows run by Black trans performers, tipping and paying entertainers living wages, and advocating for inclusive hiring practices.\n\n“You shouldn’t wait until somebody is on Drag Race to show your support,” says Afrosephone. “The one thing that will keep us performing, the one thing that will keep us afloat, is if you show up.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "description": "Former Real Housewives of New York star Bethenny Frankel moved to Florida last year. She's in her 'nightgown era' and is building a dating community.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 55-year-old Bethenny Frankel, former star of The Real Housewives of New York City and founder of The Core, a private dating membership community. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have a much bigger business now than when I was on The Real Housewives of New York City, was running Skinnygirl, my lifestyle brand famous for its low-calorie cocktails, and landed on the cover of Forbes.\n\nI got a big one-time check when I sold the liquor arm of Skinnygirl, but what I'm doing now, through The Core, my private dating membership community, influencing, and investing, is bigger than ever.\n\nI'm busy, but I'm not sitting at a desk every day. My brain works well, I have a phone, and that's really all I need. I wrote most of my New York Times bestselling books on a BlackBerry.\n\nHere's a typical day in my life.\n\nI wake up fairly early. I let the dogs out, then go give my daughter a hug and a kiss if she lets me in her room for a second. I really love that. I tend to troll her by sitting on her bed for a few minutes, but I've learned that teens don't like to talk in the morning.\n\nI make myself a strong iced coffee with my Cumulus coffee maker and feed the dogs. My dogs are really important to me, and I try to get as many good snuggles in with them as I can.\n\nBetween 7:30 and 8:30 a.m., I usually go for a walk on the beach. I moved from New York to South Florida in March 2025, and I love wandering around like a weirdo on the beach. I often finish the walks by jumping into the sea.\n\nI like taking calls while walking on the beach. In the morning, these are usually with one team member handling brand partnerships and appearances, and with my COO, where we discuss bigger deals, contract negotiations, and my investments.\n\nSince we launched The Core in December, it's taken up a big part of my day. It brings together the trust I've built as an entrepreneur with my crazy Rolodex of incredibly powerful and successful people.\n\nI'm passionate about it, and passion is my thing. When I start obsessing over something — it was the same with BStrong, my disaster-relief initiative I launched in 2017 in response to that year's devastating hurricane season — it's the only thing I'm talking about.\n\nLike every other business I've run, it's a case of building the plane while flying it. A lot of the work involves responding to texts and voice-noting somebody, asking them to do something.\n\nIf someone wants to get on the phone with me, I'll often take the call while I'm in the car. Otherwise, that time is wasted, and I don't waste time, food, or money.\n\nMy days aren't tightly structured, and I don't like feeling shackled by having too many things I have to do. The day often gets away from me before I've even showered, and my team will remind me that I have 15 minutes until I need to record my podcast, \"Just B with Bethenny Frankel.\"\n\nI record the episodes at home. Mostly, I don't care about having guests on. If I talk about my pillowcases and the bacterial facial infection I got on vacation, it will rate just as well as having Madonna.\n\nI'll usually rant for about an hour. I only like to sit and talk about what I want to talk about. It's almost like my own personal therapy monologue.\n\nThis year, I've been more open to meeting people for meals and coffee.\n\nOtherwise, I have my \"supermodel snacks\" for lunch, often seaweed stuffed with salad or turkey or rice cakes with avocado or cottage cheese.\n\nI don't plan to record my social media videos; it's mostly spontaneous. I don't post them as much as I used to. I've told my team I only want to put out excellent content, not filler.\n\nOften, my posts are just about something that's happened to me, and that leads companies to want to do brand deals. Once a week, I bang out those brand videos. The companies send the products to my home, and I film for two to three hours.\n\nI'm constantly being sent expensive things by major brands, from mattresses to nonalcoholic drinks to vape pipes. I also buy a lot of products to try myself. Once that stuff arrives, I want it out of my house as quickly as possible.\n\nAs a result, gift-giving has become a huge part of my day. If anyone does anything nice for me, whether it's at the nail salon or anywhere else, I want to give them a gift. I feel like the universe gave the \"get stuff\" crown to the right person: I like to share the wealth.\n\nIn the evenings, I try to protect my peace and avoid getting too activated by anything. I like to find a TV series that has thousands of episodes to work through. Right now, that's The Walking Dead, which I've been watching in my nightgown. I'm in my nightgown era. I also like to take a bath before I go to sleep.\n\nI listen to my body. I'm an efficient, very organized person, but I'm also a lounger, a pyjama-wearer, and a relaxer. I chill a decent amount each day.\n\nI also listen to my body for cues on when to eat or snack. I'll make dinner reservations, but often change them because I'm not hungry enough.\n\nI couldn't care less about traditional meal times.\n\nThe other night, I went to Trader Joe's and cooked a big dinner at home for my daughter, the guy I'm seeing, and a girlfriend. In Florida, I'm more sociable than I was in New York. I'm actually seeing other human life, outside of dating or being paid.\n\nWhat I cook often depends on what's already in the fridge. I enjoy the process of taking ingredients out, laying them out on the counter, and cooking.\n\nI also feel pride that my daughter sees that, even with how busy I am with my career, I'm able to do this really normal thing for her. That's meaningful for me.",

    "fullText": "Leaving Mexico City, the place I grew up, wasn't impulsive. It was calculated — shaped by ambition and the stubborn belief that opportunity still lives somewhere else.\n\nI headed to New York City in 2020, hoping to prove myself on what I thought was the world's biggest stage. I enrolled in law school, eager to work hard and prove myself.\n\nThe city would eventually demand everything from me, relentlessly, until my life was no longer about ambition but survival.\n\nI eventually left New York City two years later, learning a lot about ambition and the true cost of the American dream.\n\nI was born and raised in Mexico City. It was the only home I'd ever known, which made leaving both harder and more necessary than I expected. Mexico City gave me everything: a vibrant social life, deep friendships, culture that felt alive in every neighborhood, and food that made you want to stay at the table for hours. My days were rich with spontaneity. My nights felt endless in the best way.\n\nGrowing up there also meant learning to coexist with things that slowly wear you down. News alerts about violence became routine. Conversations casually referenced kidnappings the way others might discuss traffic. Certain neighborhoods, roads, or situations were simply off-limits. Everyone knew it, and no one questioned it.\n\nOver time, crime made my future feel fragile. When you're born somewhere, you learn to accept these things as normal. But that doesn't mean they don't accumulate. I didn't want to build a life that depended on constantly calculating risk.\n\nAt the same time, I felt pulled toward something else entirely. The American dream may be bruised and unevenly distributed, but it still exerts a gravitational force. New York represented access to industries, ambition, and reinvention. I wanted to test myself somewhere the ceiling felt higher, even if the floor was harder.\n\nI moved to Manhattan at the end of 2020. Despite the pandemic, my experience wasn't diminished. I watched the city come back to life at full speed.\n\nNew York was exactly as advertised: expensive, intense, chaotic, and unapologetically demanding. It rewarded momentum and punished hesitation. Everything required effort: finding housing, building community, maintaining balance.\n\nAt first, I embraced the intensity. I worked constantly, studied late into the night, stayed busy, and told myself exhaustion was proof I was doing something right. But New York normalizes extremes. Long hours become the baseline. Hustle becomes identity. Rest starts to feel indulgent.\n\nWhat made New York thrilling in the short term felt unsustainable when I imagined it as permanent. The social life, the hustle culture, the constant stimulation — all of it left little room for pause.\n\nStaying long-term meant accepting a life where I had to keep my foot on the gas pedal.\n\nNew York forced me to confront my relationship with ambition, productivity, and self-worth. It taught me discipline and precision. It also clarified my limits. I learned that opportunity without sustainability eventually becomes a trap, not a privilege.\n\nI understood exactly what the city offered: access, intensity, momentum. I also understood exactly what New York and the American dream demanded in return: everything.\n\nI knew then I didn't want to build a life that required me to be \"on\" constantly. I started prioritizing myself and my core convictions, love, relationships, and sustainability. That change would eventually take me out of New York City and into another global hub: London.",

    "fullText": "New York Giants linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux is embracing the arrival of new head coach John Harbaugh, praising his \"old-school\" coaching style as a much-needed reset for the team.\n\nDuring Super Bowl week in San Francisco, Thibodeaux made inquiries about Harbaugh, speaking with \"a few older guys\" who had played under him in Baltimore. The feedback reinforced Harbaugh's reputation as a strict, no-nonsense leader who \"knows football and he loves football.\"\n\nThibodeaux expressed enthusiasm for the straightforward approach.\n\n\"I always like when you pass a certain age, you don’t have to sugarcoat what you say, you’re just kinda straightforward, white and black,\" Thibodeaux said, via the New York Post. \"You see a lot of different cultures, different people that want to sometimes change their ways for the new generation or they want to fit in or whatever the case may be.\n\n\"For me, specifically, I like old-school coaches because they just take no (expletive), black and white, you know what you’re gonna get every day. I think with a lot of young guys that we have, I think it’s gonna be good for him to really get it in order.\"\n\nThis comes after an earlier denial in January, when Thibodeaux dismissed suggestions on social media that Giants players were calling around about Harbaugh, responding to team legend Carl Banks: \"Nobody's doing this, Carl. Effort was never the problem.\"\n\nHis recent comments show he has since actively sought insights into the coach hired to turn around the franchise following seasons of inconsistency.\n\nThibodeaux, who had his fifth-year option picked up, remains optimistic about the defense under new coordinator Dennard Wilson and is relieved that position coach Charlie Bullen was retained... For now.\n\nAfter a 2025 season cut short by injury, Thibodeaux is cleared medically and eager to thrive in Harbaugh's structured environment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Kayvon Thibodeaux loves John Harbaugh's 'old-school' coaching style",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (PIX11) — A New Jersey mother is sharing her daughter’s story in hopes of changing how high-caffeine drinks are labeled across the country, and the effort is now reaching Capitol Hill.\n\n“That was the day when my life changed forever,” Jill Katz said. It’s been years since her daughter Sarah died. In 2022, the 21-year-old college student went into cardiac arrest while out with friends. Her mother says it all started with a cup of lemonade, packed with caffeine.\n“She was at a friend’s birthday party, in college, and she collapsed. She didn’t make it,” Katz said. “It’s the call that keeps parents awake at night.”\n\nSarah had a heart condition, and her family says she had always been mindful about what she ate and drank. According to her mother, she didn’t realize that 30 ounces of the drink she ordered at a popular restaurant chain contained as much as 390 milligrams of caffeine.\n\nFor context, the FDA says most healthy adults should consume no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, so the drink Sarah had was close to that limit in a single serving. “With grief, there is no restoration, but transformation,” Katz said. “Being involved with her legacy and being able to save other people’s lives in her memory.”\n\nMore: Latest News from Around the Tri-State\n\nThe restaurant chain has since removed the item from its menu following multiple lawsuits.\n\nCaffeine is widely used to boost energy by stimulating metabolism and making the heartbeat faster. Doctors, however, say high doses can be risky, especially for people with underlying conditions.\n\nAccording to the Caffeine Informer database, a single shot of espresso contains about 77 milligrams of caffeine. Energy drinks can range from 80 to 300 milligrams, depending on the brand and size. “When you stimulate so much, and the heart is not prepared for that, they can just collapse,” said cardiologist Dr. Daniel Garcia.\n\nGarcia says the lack of consistent labeling and regulation around caffeine can be dangerous for everyone, from college students to older adults. “As a cardiologist, I advise completely against any energy drink or high-content caffeine drink,” he said. “You don’t know exactly what the amount is and how your body is going to respond.”\n\nNow, Sarah’s death is drawing attention from lawmakers.\n\nNew Jersey Congressman Rob Menendez is pushing for the Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act, federal legislation that would require clearer warnings about caffeine in foods and beverages.\n\nRequire companies to clearly list caffeine content on bottles, cans, and packaging.\n\nRequire chain restaurants to disclose caffeine levels on menus.\n\nFlag items with 150 milligrams or more of caffeine with a visible “high caffeine” warning.\n\nAdd advisory language about recommended daily caffeine limits.\n\nOrder federal health agencies to study caffeine’s health effects and launch public education campaigns.\n\nSupporters say the goal is not to ban caffeinated drinks, but to make sure consumers know what they’re getting before they take a sip. “People need to know what they’re putting in their bodies,” Katz said. “We’re not talking about limiting or banning. We’re talking about making an informed choice.”\n\nThe bill has bipartisan support in Congress, with a total of 14 cosponsors, both Republicans and Democrats.",

But, I think I learned through the highs and the lows.”\n\nMust Watch: Her sister’s reaction is incredible\n\nUSWNT and North Carolina Courage midfielder Riley Jackson shares her excitement to finding out she made the senior team for the first time, her sister’s hilarious reaction, and her first ever goal contribution – an assist to Trinity Rodman.\n\nRookie of the Year finalist on her storybook season\n\nAngel City FC forward Riley Tiernan talks about her special rookie season and if she’s had a chance to take in all of the wonderful success from it.\n\n“I was not expecting any of this coming out of college. It’s everything I’ve worked for. It’s something I’ve been working towards my whole life. But, to see it all fall into place and to get these small and big accomplishments has been really special.”\n\n“I would say I’m still digesting, the fact that I’m living in the best place in the world, doing what I love to do for a job.”\n\nEmeri Adames is very serious about her national holiday idea\n\nSeattle Reign forward Emeri Adames reveals her idea for a national holiday, and you better like it!\n\n“I would do National Pickle Day because I love pickles so much. I think everyone should like pickles. And when they say they don’t like pickles, it makes me mad.”\n\nSan Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley reveals while at Target, she found out that she had made the USWNT.\n\n“It was really exciting. I had gotten an email but I don’t check it as frequently as I should. So I was a little bit late, but I saw it when I was with my mom at Target. We were both through the roof, very surprised, very full of excitement and gratitude.”\n\n2025 NWSL Midfielder of the Year\n\nNorth Carolina Courage star Manaka Matsukubo shares what it means to be honored with that award and gives plenty of love to her teammates and family.\n\n“I am honored.

Now, she is shining brighter than ever.\n\nThe goalkeeper discussed her unique journey with us.\n\nCalifornia native Onyeka Gamero shares what it means to be coming back to her home state and join the NWSL.\n\n“I remember saying, ‘I want to be back in the U.S., I’ll go anywhere.’ But of course being in California – my parents right there, everything is so familiar.”\n\n“It just feels nice. I feel good. For me as a player, I feel like that’s where it starts, just feeling ok.”\n\nWashington Spirit star midfielder Croix Bethune shares some of the key details from her conversation with USWNT head coach Emma Hayes.\n\nCasey Murphy made a big move to the Boston Legacy joining as a free agent goalkeeper. One of the reasons she gave at NWSL media day was the titles. Boston is a city that notoriously cares deeply about their sports.

The Jets signed him to a four-year contract that includes $7.9m guaranteed but after disciplinary problems and poor play he left the Jets in 2019.\n\nLee was a part of the Kansas City Chiefs roster that won the Super Bowl in February 2020, although he did not play in the game itself.

    "fullText": "At first glance, the New York Mets’ recent trade for center fielder Luis Robert Jr. was made to fill a specific hole. The Mets need a good defensive outfielder to hold the fort while prospect Carson Benge finishes developing, and Robert fits the bill.\n\nBeyond that, many consider Robert a broken player who can’t be fixed, but the Mets don’t really share that perspective. David Adler of MLB.com tried to get beneath the obvious reasons for the trade to see why the Mets have a different opinion, and he came up with three numbers that could explain the team’s logic.\n\nThe first is bat speed. According to Adler Robert ranked in the top ten percent of all players at 75.6 mph. It’s an impressive stat, but the logic here is a little sketchy. Robert’s offensive numbers have been terrible for several seasons now, so just because the former Chicago White Sox outfielder has bat speed doesn’t mean he can actually put it in play and be productive again.\n\nThe second number Adler used is the obvious one: Robert’s outs above average number was +7, and that’s why they traded for him. Mets GM David Stearn made it abundantly clear that run prevention would be a priority this season, and Robert fits the bill and then some. That particular stat reflects his strong range, which Robert will definitely need in an outfield where he’ll be playing alongside right fielder Juan Soto and a player to be named later in left\n\nThe third number is about Robert’s speed, which really hasn’t been discussed much. His sprint speed is 29.0 feet per second, according to Adler, and that puts him in the upper tier of all MLB runners. Indeed, it’s almost elite, so if Robert can hit even a little bit, he could match or exceed the 33 stolen bases he posted last year, which was a career high for him.\n\nSome of the potential associated with these numbers is obviously speculative, but the good news is that (a) they didn’t give up much to get him, and (b) contract wise, this is a low-risk deal. Robert is playing for $20 million this year, which is pricey for what he’s done offensively, but Stearns has been emphasizing short-term deals in his acquisition this offseason, so if Robert disappoint as a hitter, the Mets can simply benefit from his defense, then move on from him at the end of the season.",
