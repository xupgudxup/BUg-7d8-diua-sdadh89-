    "fullText": "Former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Justin Fields could be finding a new NFL home this offseason.\n\nThe New York Jets inked a two-year, $40 million contract with Fields this offseason, but his performance this season was far from stellar. In nine games, he threw for 1,259 yards and only 7 touchdowns.\n\nNew York will likely be looking for a new starting quarterback this offseason, and CBS Sports NFL writer Joel Corry thinks the Jets could move Fields this offseason.\n\n“The Jets signed Fields to a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million fully guaranteed as an unrestricted free agent last March in the hopes that he would be more than a bridge quarterback,” Corry wrote on Wednesday. “Fields’ preseason struggles were dismissed rather than seen as a warning sign after he played well against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular season opener.\n\n“It was downhill for the 2021 first-round pick after the Steelers game. Fields had a dubious distinction in a Week 6 loss to the Broncos. He was sacked nine times in producing a franchise-worst minus-10 net passing yards. Fields was benched nine games into the season.”\n\nThere’s a possibility that the Steelers could reunite with Fields this offseason, especially if Aaron Rodgers doesn’t come back. They will be in the market for a quarterback.\n\nMore NFL: Former Steelers Star Placed At No. 2 In ESPN’s Free-Agent Rankings\n\nThe post NFL Writer Suggests Former Steelers Quarterback Might Be Moved This Offseason appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "description": "After college, my partner and I moved to New York City to live together and start our careers. I had no idea how much I'd miss living with my friends.",
    "fullText": "I still remember pulling out of the driveway of the house I'd shared with the same five girls for three years.\n\nI sat in the passenger seat, waving goodbye as my boyfriend drove away. We both cried, unable to fathom that college was really over.\n\nAs we road-tripped from Ann Arbor, Michigan, back to the Northeast (where we're both from), we felt excited for the next chapter of our lives — starting our careers in New York City and moving in together. But we were also going through our own forms of a breakup, just not with each other.\n\nMy housemates and I weren't just housemates. We were pandemic-era housemates, meaning we ate breakfast together at our tiny kitchen table every morning and took our remote classes from the same living room couch.\n\nMy boyfriend had a similar experience, living with friends in a house around the corner from mine.\n\nSomewhere along the way, both of our friend groups became like family, barging into each other's houses without notice and spending endless hours together.\n\nI had no idea just how much I'd miss that.\n\nJust one month after graduation, I had a cute, albeit tiny, apartment in Manhattan with swanky restaurants on each corner, a pickleball court nearby, and 24/7 access to pizza and bagels. And I was doing it all with my boyfriend by my side.\n\nI had achieved the dream so many Long Island-raised kids like myself had growing up.\n\nBut as much as I tried to romanticize my compact kitchen appliances and lack of windows (and consequently, sunlight), I longed for sunny days on my front porch in Ann Arbor with my five best friends sipping lattes out of mason jars, talking about absolutely nothing.\n\nMy boyfriend missed his version of this, too, sipping bottles of beer with his five housemates, talking mostly about football.\n\nWe both longed to be somewhere else. And I, for one, felt guilty.\n\nStruggling to adjust to our 9-to-5 schedules in a new city, we often found ourselves sitting around the apartment, lacking the energy to do all the fun things we used to love.\n\nI did make some new friends, but I struggled to put in the effort to maintain them. I often wondered if it was even possible to find the same level of friendship I had with my college housemates.\n\nI'd replay the highlight reel of memories in my mind — prank wars that would last for weeks, communicating with our next-door neighbors via handwritten signs taped to our windows, and nights in watching old One Direction music videos.\n\nAlthough we still kept in touch via our group chat, it just wasn't the same as waking up every morning to all my favorite people in one place.\n\nIt was as if I'd been living in my very own sitcom for three years — one that could never be recreated — with the perfect mix of characters, all in the right place at the right time.\n\nAnd like all sitcoms, it had to come to an end. I was holding out hope for a spinoff, but I had to let go.\n\nI realized that what I really needed most was time. There wasn't one thing in particular that magically made me stop missing my friends so much. It took about a year to adapt to my new routine and start feeling like myself again.\n\nIn the meantime, I let myself be sad, and I stopped feeling guilty about it. I leaned on the one person who understood my sadness on a personal level: my boyfriend.\n\nWe talked about missing our best friends, Ann Arbor, and our life together before we moved to New York City. It felt good to have someone who was going through the same thing.\n\nSlowly but surely, we adjusted to our new reality and started finding joy in the little things, like decorating our apartment, trying new bagel spots, and perfecting homemade vodka sauce.\n\nAs for my housemates, we continue to find unique ways to stay in touch. We partake in our own Secret Santa each year. We email each other life updates through personalized newsletters that are way too detailed. We schedule visits throughout the year and meet up around the country. Every time we do, it's like we're back home.\n\nOf course, I still miss them. But I've learned to cherish the people that are nearby — both new friends I've met in the city and old ones I grew up with back on Long Island. I've also made more of an effort to spend time with family. Thankfully, they're only a train ride away.\n\nTwo and a half years postgrad, my boyfriend and I still live together, but now we have a new apartment with a full-sized oven and more windows to let in plenty of sunlight.\n\nWe see our best friends a few times a year and spend the remaining 300-and-something days trying to convince them all to move to New York. And in the meantime, we've built a life we're happy with.",

    "description": ", Jonathan Landay and Matt Spetalnick NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence reports have raised doubts about whether interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez will cooperate",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence reports have raised doubts about whether interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez will cooperate with the Trump administration by formally cutting ties with U.S. adversaries, four people familiar with the reports said in recent days.\n\nU.S. officials have ​said publicly they want the interim president to sever relations with close international allies like Iran, China and Russia, including expelling their diplomats and advisers from Venezuela.\n\nBut ‌Rodriguez, whose swearing-in ceremony was attended by representatives of those countries early this month, has yet to publicly announce such a move. She became president after the U.S. captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3.\n\nThe ‌U.S. intelligence reports said it was not clear if she is fully on board with the U.S. strategy in her country, according to the sources, who declined to be identified by name.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe traveled on January 15 to Caracas, where he discussed the country's political future with Rodriguez. Reuters could not determine if those conversations changed the intelligence agencies' opinion.\n\nWashington wants to rein in its foes' influence in the Western hemisphere, including in Venezuela, where Trump seeks to exploit the OPEC nation’s vast oil reserves.\n\nIf Rodriguez were to break ties with the U.S. rivals, ⁠it would open more opportunity for U.S. investment in Venezuela’s ‌energy sector. But failure to control Rodriguez could undercut Washington’s efforts to direct the country’s interim rulers from afar and avoid a deeper U.S. military role.\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency and the Venezuela government did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAsked for comment, a senior Trump administration official, who ‍declined to be identified, said U.S. President Donald Trump \"continues to exert maximum leverage\" over Venezuela's leaders and \"expects this cooperation to continue.\"\n\nThe CIA has previously assessed that officials loyal to Maduro, including Rodriguez, were best positioned to govern the country following his ouster.\n\nBut critics of Trump's Venezuela strategy have expressed doubts about the wisdom of keeping Maduro's loyalists in place as the country's interim leaders. The concerns ​about Rodriguez' reliability were present prior to the U.S. military operation, said two sources.\n\nFor Venezuela, the U.S. directive means abandoning its closest allies outside the region. Iran has ‌helped Venezuela repair oil refineries while China has taken oil as repayment for debt. Russia has supplied weaponry, including missiles, to Venezuela's military.\n\nTrump has also cited communist-led Cuba as another U.S. foe he wants Venezuela to abandon. Havana has provided security and intelligence support while receiving cut-rate Venezuelan oil.\n\nSince Maduro's removal, Rodriguez, whose deep ties to the oil sector are crucial to keeping the country stable, has taken steps to stay in favor with Washington including releasing political prisoners and authorizing the sale of 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States.\n\nIn a speech on Sunday, Rodriguez said she has had “enough” of U.S. intervention. Still, U.S. officials have also held positive calls with her in recent days, according ⁠to two of the sources.\n\nThe Trump administration does not see an immediate alternative to working with Rodriguez, ​given it has publicly backed her so strongly, two of the sources said.\n\nBut U.S. officials are developing ​contacts with senior military and security officials in case they decide to change their approach, a source briefed on Venezuela policy said.\n\nMACHADO CONSIDERED A LONGER-TERM OPTION TO RUN VENEZUELA\n\nThe recent intelligence reports also found that opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is not currently able to run the country successfully ‍in part because she lacks strong ties to ⁠the country’s security services or oil sector, the sources said.\n\nSome observers and Machado's movement say it won a 2024 election that year by a huge margin, though the state backed a Maduro victory. She remains popular with Venezuelans.\n\nTrump told reporters last week he wanted Machado “involved” in the country’s leadership, without providing details.\n\nOne person familiar with ⁠the administration’s discussions with Machado said she is well-liked by the White House and is considered a longer-term option for a leadership position in Venezuela.\n\nThe separate source briefed on Venezuela policy suggested that for now, Machado ‌could be considered for an advisory role but no firm decision had been made. Representatives for Machado did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Erin Banco, Jonathan Landay and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Don Durfee and Cynthia Osterman)",

    "description": "A WFAN host argues that the New York Giants should sign WR Odell Beckham Jr., reuniting him with head coach John Harbaugh.",
    "fullText": "Following the New York Giants' hiring of John Harbaugh, the top head coaching candidate on the market, excitement surrounds the changes the Giants will make this offseason.\n\nHarbaugh has already begun overhauling the coaching staff, bringing in several coaches he previously worked with during his time with the Baltimore Ravens. With free agency approaching, many have speculated about Ravens free agents who could follow their former head coach to New York.\n\nThere may also be interest in targeting free agents who previously played for both the Giants and Harbaugh, such as Kevin Zeitler, Jihad Ward, or even former star receiver Odell Beckham Jr.\n\nWFAN's Tommy Lugauer believes a reunion with Beckham is something the Giants should explore.\n\nTommy calls for the Giants to bring back Odell Beckham Jr:@tommylugauer pic.twitter.com/i9TRz55iBu\n\n— WFAN Sports Radio (@WFAN660) January 27, 2026\n\n\"So here's my suggestion. A wide receiver that is no stranger to the Giants, a wide receiver that is no stranger to John Harbaugh. A wide receiver that has already had a conversation with Jaxson Dart about John Harbaugh,\" he said. \"And that man's name is Odell Beckham Jr. That's right. OBJ reuniting in New York in a different role than he had in his previous stop, where he was the number one wide receiver, the playmaker. Now as a grizzled vet, a guy that's won a championship, has been around the block -- a chance to come back home.\n\n\"A chance to reunite not only with the Giants but with John Harbaugh, and be a valued wide receiver and playmaker for young Jaxson Dart and a young Giants offense. So there's already a relationship with Harbaugh and OBJ. There's obviously a relationship with Beckham and the Giants. Many were sad when he was sent away, when he was traded off. Now here's the opportunity for the reunion. So Joe Schoen, John Harbaugh -- make it happen. Odell Beckham Jr. back with the Giants.\"\n\nA Beckham-Giants reunion has been discussed for years following the trade that sent the former first-round pick to the Cleveland Browns. Beckham was one of the franchise's most popular players in recent memory, and he has certainly shown interest in returning to the Giants before his career ends.\n\nAs much fun as the reunion may be, it is certainly questionable how much production Beckham could add as a playmaker at 33 years old.\n\nHe last played in 2024 with the Miami Dolphins, appearing in nine games and hauling in just nine catches for 55 yards. Beckham also played for Harbaugh and the Ravens in 2023, when he racked up over 500 yards and three touchdowns on 35 receptions.\n\nWith the Giants relying heavily on the return of Malik Nabers and many questions surrounding the wide receiver corps beyond him, Beckham could provide veteran leadership for his fellow LSU alumnus to learn from and someone the young receivers can lean on during Nabers' recovery from injury.\n\nBeckham, of course, also suffered a pair of ACL tears in his post-Giants career, including one in Super Bowl LVI, where he scored the game's first touchdown, helping the Rams secure the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nBeckham has previously expressed interest in continuing his career, and finishing it in a Giants uniform could be just what he needs. However, it would have to make sense for the Giants, who would need to feel confident in Beckham's ability to help the team at this stage of his career.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Should New York Giants reunite Odell Beckham Jr. with John Harbaugh?",

    "fullText": "Florida state Sen. Ileana Garcia (R), co-founder of Latinas for Trump, blasted President Trump’s immigration crackdown, warning he “will lose the midterms” because of White House adviser Stephen Miller.\n\n“I do think that he will lose the midterms because of Stephen Miller,” Garcia told The New York Times in an interview published Tuesday.\n\nThough Garcia was openly supportive of Trump’s plans to close the border, she placed blame on Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, for the aggressive tactics used during the current crackdown.\n\nHer comments come after federal agents in Minneapolis over the weekend shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti amid a protest against the administration’s immigration action, weeks after an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in the city earlier this month.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti “attacked” federal law enforcement, while Miller described Pretti as “a would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal law enforcement.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday distanced Trump from those remarks, saying she had not heard the president “characterize Mr. Pretti in that way” and deferring to the investigation.\n\n“Distorting, politicizing, slandering – justifying what happened to Alex Pretti contradicts the American values the administration campaigned on.  He was neither a domestic terrorist nor an assassin,” Garcia wrote in a Monday post on the social platform X, responding to Miller’s characterization of the incident.\n\n“Allowing individuals like Stephen Miller, among others, who represent the government and make hard-line decisions, to make such comments will have long term consequences. … This is not what I voted for!” she continued.\n\nGarcia, who rallied support from Latina voters to help get Trump elected in 2016 and served in Trump’s Department of Homeland Security during his first term, has blasted what she last year called “inhumane” tactics to meet deportation goals.\n\nHer comments mark the latest sign of growing frustration with Trump’s immigration handling as fallout from the Minnesota shootings grows, as observers warn the issue could have a lingering impact on November’s high-stakes midterms.",

    "fullText": "New York Giants general manager Joe Schoen and recently hired head coach John Harbaugh are not expected to travel to Mobile, Alabama, for this year's Senior Bowl, prioritizing other pressing team needs over an in-person presence at the premier pre-draft showcase.\n\nAs Pat Traina of Sports Illustrated reported:\n\nNew York Giants general manager Joe Schoen and new head coach John Harbaugh are not planning to attend this year’s Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama; the team instead plans to have a heavier scouting presence, a source confirms to New York Giants On SI.\n\nSchoen and Harbaugh, who are being entrusted with building the Giants into a contender as soon as next season, are currently focused on building up Harbaugh’s assistant staff, which is expected to be a large group of men and women, with a heavy lean toward assistants Harbaugh had in Baltimore.\n\nTheir absence is not expected to hinder the Giants’ evaluation process. The organization will deploy an expanded contingent of scouts to the event and rely on comprehensive practice and game footage supplied by Senior Bowl organizers.\n\nThe decision reflects a strategic focus on constructing Harbaugh's coaching staff, which is anticipated to include numerous assistants from his long tenure in Baltimore.\n\nWith Harbaugh reportedly holding significant influence on personnel decisions -- greater than recent predecessors -- the front office is devoting its energy to finalizing key hires, such as offensive coordinator, offensive line coach, and quarterbacks coach.\n\nWhile the Senior Bowl offers valuable networking opportunities with coaching candidates, the Giants' current priorities lie in building infrastructure around their new leadership rather than on-site executive attendance.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants' Joe Schoen, John Harbaugh will skip Senior Bowl",

    "description": "This is the Maryland Minute, a short story followed by a roundup of Terps-related news.",
    "fullText": "Current New York Giants head coach John Harbaugh will forever be linked with the DMV after his long tenure as coach of the Baltimore Ravens. And those ties shone through over the weekend.\n\nHarbaugh’s first official hire as Giants head coach was bringing in former Maryland cornerback and safety Dennard Wilson to be the team’s defensive coordinator.\n\nThe 44-year-old played 42 games for the Terps between 2000-2003, finishing his senior year as team captain and an honorable mention all-ACC pick. He was also a graduate assistant for the Terps from 2007-2008, after getting his start as defensive backs coach at DeMatha High School.\n\nWilson was formerly defensive backs coach for the Ravens in 2023 — where he and Harbaugh truly connected — and defensive backs coach and passing coordinator for the Philadelphia Eagles from 2020-2022.\n\nMost recently and most notably, though, he was the defensive coordinator for the Tennessee Titans from 2024-25.\n\nUnder Wilson’s leadership in 2024, the Titans finished second in the league in total defense and passing defense — their highest ranks since 2000. This year, the Titans were ranked 21st in the league.\n\nSeveral around the Giants organization had incredibly good things to say about Wilson, who chose the Giants after also interviewing with the Los Angeles Chargers for the same role.\n\n“When asking those guys if they thought Dennard had coordinator potential, both of the men said, ‘no, this is a head coach”@Connor_J_Hughes breaks down the hiring of the Giants new defensive coordinator Dennard Wilson: pic.twitter.com/Jcz3A2GTbn\n\n— Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) January 25, 2026\n\nInterestingly, the Giants looked to hire Wilson to be their defensive coordinator in 2024, when he chose the Titans’ job over New York.\n\nNow, he’ll have to turn around a defense that has several talented pieces, including fellow Maryland alums Deonte Banks and Beau Brade, but finished 28th in the NFL in total defense last season.\n\nMaryland had a men’s basketball game Saturday.

    "fullText": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) this weekend accused Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of applying a stark double standard in her comments made after the killing of Alex Pretti by a federal agent during an anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis, the second such death in the city this month.\n\nIn one part of an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, which has gone viral with almost 3 million views on one X post alone, Ocasio-Cortez sharply criticized Noem’s suggestion that people should not attend protests with firearms, arguing the stance clashes with the Trump administration and conservatives’ fawning over previous armed protesters on the political right.\n\nPolitics: Kristi Noem Slips Up With Awkward Typo In Heated Post About Immigrants In Minneapolis\n\nPretti was a legal gun owner who was licensed to carry a concealed weapon. Minnesota law allows permit holders to carry firearms in public, including at protests. The government’s claim that he was armed and provoking violence is at odds with videos and witness statements circulating publicly.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said: “How rich is it that she is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person’s death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and the same administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse?”\n\n“When she [Noem] is talking about how merely showing up and inciting violence based on ideology against the government, when this administration has pardoned hundreds of Jan. 6th rioters who have then gone out into the streets and recommitted crimes of violence over and over again,” she continued.\n\nThe New York Democrat argued the message that is being sent is solely political: “What Secretary Noem is saying is not that you can’t do these things, is not that you can’t be armed, is not that you can’t attack your government. She just thinks that you can’t do that based on your political affiliation.”\n\nPolitics: 'I Can't Watch': Trump Fires Off Unexpected Whine At The Worst Possible Time\n\nThe lawmaker also warned: “The uncorking of chaos that this administration is trying to attempt against the American people is escalatory, it is dangerous and it is a complete abdication of leadership.”\n\n“We cannot go down this road,” Ocasio-Cortez added. “We cannot have countrymen against countrymen, citizen against citizen. This is not the America that we believe in. It is not the America that we stand in and we must unite together against this kind of very dangerous splintering that they are seeking to incite against people and divide us.”\n\nEconomist Sounds Alarm On Damage Trump Is Quietly Doing To The Economy\n\nKash Patel’s Viral Line About Protesters Sparks Anger Online\n\nMelania Trump Told To 'Read The Room' Over Documentary Stunt",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump stunned members of his inner circle by calmly predicting when his own body would be lying in state, according to a new report.\n\nThe 79-year-old president reportedly made the comment at Mar-a-Lago as television screens showed Jimmy Carter’s casket at the U.S. Capitol, telling the room: “You know, within ten years that will be me.”\n\nThe remark, attributed to a person familiar with his comments, appears in a sprawling New York Magazine profile, “The Superhuman President,” about the president’s health and psyche.\n\nThe episode adds a morbid twist to how Trump and his team now talk about 2028.\n\nOne senior White House official told New York Magazine that “the specter of death sometimes manifests in the 2028 conversation,” describing aides gaming out whether the president will be willing—or able—to mount yet another run when he will be in his early 80s.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has leaned into the idea that clinging to the presidency is what keeps him alive.\n\nTrump is already the oldest person ever to be elected president.\n\nInstead of talking about slowing down, he has repeatedly teased the prospect of running again, boasting that he could seek a third term and even what would amount to a fourth term, when he is 86, even as legal experts point out the constitutional two-term limit.\n\nTrump’s brags clash with mounting unease about his health, which the Daily Beast has led the way in reporting.\n\nIn the New York Magazine piece, aides fret about his bruised hands, frequent naps in public, and a mysterious MRI trip to Walter Reed that the White House struggled to explain.\n\nFormer White House lawyer Ty Cobb warned this month that Trump’s cognitive decline is “palpable,” while prominent physician Dr. Bruce Davison told the Beast’s podcast that the president’s daily 325 mg aspirin regimen is the kind of dose usually reserved for stroke patients.\n\nInside Trump’s circle, the result is a strange dual reality, of a president who talks about death, legacy, and what he will leave behind—from a $400 million East Wing ballroom to the “Arc de Trump” he wants erected across from the Lincoln Memorial—while still casting himself as a superhuman figure who can outwork younger rivals and defy time.\n\nAs one senior official told New York Magazine, succession talk is as much about letting Trump live forever through his chosen heirs as it is about acknowledging that he will not.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "The lifestyles of the rich and famous sometimes seem so far out of reach.\n\nWith homes selling for upward of $50 million and billionaires building compounds to disallow regular folks from taking a glance at luxury, one end of the real estate market seems to be growing exponentially.\n\nThose enormous price tags can be jarring when looking for a home, but in reality, the median price of a luxury home is far lower. The entry point of luxury, which is defined as the 90th percentile of listing prices, was $1.19 million in December, according to Realtor.com. That price was about three times the national median home listing price of $399,950.\n\nBut there are some places where luxury, mega-luxury, and standard homes exist side-by-side. While that may seem concerning for those who are looking for affordable homes, these different markets don't always impact each other.\n\n\"Big gaps between luxury and typical home prices aren't automatically a warning sign,\" Realtor.com senior economist Anthony Smith said. \"They often point to markets that are highly segmented, where luxury behaves differently from the rest of the housing market. In those places, even small shifts at the high end can create noticeable changes in luxury pricing without spilling over to the median home price.\"\n\nFlorida, for example, has five metros that ranked in the top 10 on Realtor.com's list of places with the widest luxury gaps in real estate, partially fueled by high-net-worth individuals moving to Florida recently. Miami specifically dethroned the New York City metro area as the city with the most $1 million-plus listings in the country. The influx of high net worth individuals into Miami is also significantly linked to an exodus from the New York metro area: Realtor noted that 26.3% of the Miami metro's demand originates from the New York metro.\n\nThere will always be gaps in the housing market separating one sector from the next. But some luxury markets differ greatly from the sector below.\n\nHere are the top 10 metros where the luxury sector is the most disconnected from the typical market, according to Realtor.com.",

    "title": "From ‘Bono’ to ‘Bozo’ already? Just let NY Giants coach John Harbaugh do his work",
    "description": "Some are already irate over choices the Giants’ new head coach is making about his assistant coaches.",
    "fullText": "It is amazing how quickly the opinions of some fans can change. And, how small things no one has any idea ill prove to be right or wrong can be the cause.\n\nWhen John Harbaugh, a Super Bowl-winning head coach with 12 playoff appearances in 18 years as head coach of the Baltimore Ravens was hired less than two weeks, there was nearly absolute joy in Giants Nation. In our poll asking if hiring Harbaugh was the right decision, 95.21% (5,227) of 5,490 voters said it was.\n\nThere were comments like these:\n\nHarbaugh and Dart will deliver us another SB, I truly believe that\n\nDart’s retiring with more rings than Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson combined. Book it.\n\nI haven’t seen Big Blue Viewers this aligned on a decision in my life. May the next decade be one of redemption.\n\nNo other hiring would have been met with the excitement, or brought the instant credibility that Harbaugh did. The Giants have been flailing for more than a decade now, going mostly in the wrong direction. Harbaugh offers them the best chance for a course correction.\n\nHe comes from a winning environment that he was a big part of establishing and maintaining. He brings with him knowledge of how the Ravens have been consistently good, and the cachet to get ideas implemented with the Giants. We are already seeing some of that take place. He brings a reputation with him for having a keen eye for finding quality young assistant coaches who could help set the organization up for sustained success.\n\nOn the field and in the locker room, Harbaugh is a culture-setting CEO type head coach who brings the ability — and credibility — to set standards and hold players accountable. The Giants, and the entire organization, desperately need that.\n\nRemember John Mara warning Brian Daboll after he won Coach of the Year honors for the 2022 season that it wasn’t hard to go from ‘Bono’ to ‘Bozo’ in the New York/New Jersey market?\n\nWell, when he was introduced as the team’s head coach last Tuesday, Harbaugh was clearly ‘Bono.’ Maybe the Beatles. In a more modern reference, perhaps Taylor Swift.\n\nToday, there are already fans throwing darts at him.\n\nFirst, Harbaugh had the temerity to send Carmen Bricillo, a popular, effective offensive line coach, packing. That led to comments like these:\n\nThis sucks especially if George Warhop is the guy to take over. Nice guy in his 60’s with lots of oline coaching experience. Unfortunately heading up many underwhelming lines.\n\nThis is a questionable move at best. I just don’t understand why he wouldn’t stay — especially since he was under contract for another year and has proven that he can work wonders with what he’s given. I also find it strange since Jack Harbaugh gave a ringing endorsement and told him to keep him. I don’t understand this at all.\n\nSo there was no bigger supporter of the JH acquisition than MaineG1…. But this is a major disappointment! I don’t understand the reason behind fixing something that’s been so horribly wrong for such a long time under any circumstance. For anyone making claims that this is just minor move and, there’s no reason for concern. You obviously haven’t been paying attention over the last 10 years. Before Bricillo, the offensive line was one of the 3 worst in NFL history.\n\nI can’t understand that Harbaugh looked at that man’s resume and came to the conclusion he could get someone better? Direct disciple of Dante Scarnecchia. Plus the job he did with the Raiders. Who by the way, were an absolute shit show just slightly less terrible than the steaming pile of dung the Giants had been trotting out over the past decade.\n\nI was also a fan of Patterson, but the run defense over the last 3 years has been dreadful…. So letting him go makes sense, but, Bricillo is a head scratcher. I also hope the plan isn’t to bring in the Oline coach from the Ravens? For those who don’t know? Joe D passed away at the beginning of the season and, was replaced by George Warhop. He was the offensive line coach for the 49ers and, Bucs I believe in the early 2000s. For the most part those lines were terrible…. 2024 under Joe D, the offensive line was really good. 2025 under Warhop, absolutely shitty. This can’t be the way.\n\nThen, Harbaugh went and hired a defensive coordinator some fans think is terrible.\n\nAnother bad Tennessee DC. I have, misgivings.\n\nOkay, it was a mistake to hire Harbaugh. Everything is going to hell. Fire Schoen. The Mara’s should be forced to sell the team. Trade Dart for draft picks. Burn it to the ground.\n\nWas hoping this was not true. Here’s his report card for his last season :\n\nTotal Defense Rank: 21st in yards, 28th in points\n\nOpponent Points: 478 allowed (28th)\n\nWay to really go for excellence Coach! Forget the guy coaching in the AFC championship or the passing coordinator in one of the most complex, vicious, aggressive modern defenses. Let’s get a guy who managed to coach a 3 win teams defense to the 28th ranking.\n\nWe really managed to grab a guy from one of the only programs worse than ours, who has no idea what winning looks like, who’s defense just Barely ranked better than Shane Bowen and Bullen…? Just fking wow.\n\nLosing Bricillo and Patterson this week coupled with this latest absurd hire, It’s been a very bad week for John harbaugh.\n\nHopefully he can at least get Monken in here.\n\nFolks around here acting like Harbs just hired Shane Bowen again!\n\nGiants fans last weekend – Give Harbaugh whatever he wants, just get him signed! In Harbaugh we trust!!!\n\nGiants fans this weekend – What??? He hired a different guy than the one I wanted?? Harbaugh out!!!\n\nHarbaugh was never going to make every decision you or I would have made. Yes, I was hoping he would keep Carmen Bricillo as offensive line coach. He didn’t. So be it. There will be more decisions you don’t like. Harbaugh will be right about some, wrong about others. Probably, he will be right far more often than he is wrong.\n\nHarbaugh has an 18-year body of really successful work with the Baltimore Ravens and a Rolodex compiled over something like four decades of coaching that earned him a five-year, $100 million contract and the ability to make the decisions he wants to make.\n\nHarbaugh is the best, most capable, most qualified person the Giants have hired on their coaching staff or in their front office since they let Tom Coughlin go after the 2015 season.\n\nHe knows what he wants in an offensive line coach. He knows plenty of people who could tell him what he wanted to know about Bricillo’s work, and his coaching style. He met with Bricillo himself. He decided Bricillo wasn’t the right coach for what he wanted. I would rather have him make that choice than keep a coach on staff he wasn’t certain about to appease the fan base, or the offensive linemen.\n\nMaybe Harbaugh will hire George Warhop, a long-time NFL offensive line coach who was with him in Baltimore the last two seasons. Maybe he will hire someone else. Maybe it will turn out well. Maybe it won’t.\n\nWhen it comes to Wilson, again Harbaugh is far more qualified to make this decision and knows far more about Wilson than any of us.\n\nYou can simply point to the 2025 statistics that showed Wilson’s Tennessee defense 28th in points and 21st in yardage allowed, and decide he is a terrible coach and a terrible hire. Or, you can look deeper.\n\nYou can look back at 2024, his first season. His bio on the Titans’ website, which likely won’t be available much longer, includes this:\n\nDuring Wilson’s first year in Tennessee, the Titans ranked second overall in total defense (311.2 opponent yards per game)—the team’s highest ranking since leading the NFL in total defense in 2000. The 2024 Titans also finished second in passing defense (177.3), which also was their best ranking since 2000 (first). Wilson’s defense tied for the fifth-fewest first downs allowed per game (18.5) and tied for the fifth-fewest opponent yards allowed per play (5.2) in 2024.\n\nYou can trust ESPN Titans beat writer Turron Davenport, who told me recently that Wilson “wasn’t given much to work with” in 2025 but did a good job.\n\nYou can trust Pro Bowl defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons, who wanted Wilson to stay in Tennessee.\n\nJeffery Simmons understands it's not up to him BUT if he has it his way, he'd love to have Dennard Wilson back with the #Titans. pic.twitter.com/Kc4Qhxurko\n\n— TURRON DAVENPORT (@TDavenport_NFL) December 31, 2025\n\nYou can trust Jimmy Morris of SB Nation’s Music City Miracles, who wrote this recently predicting Wilson would land with the Giants:\n\nWilson did a really good job with the Titans this year. The numbers weren’t great, but you have to account for the fact that all three of his starting corners were either traded or injured for most of the season. He also had zero EDGE presence for the entire year.\n\nI thought that Wilson would land as the defensive coordinator for John with the New York Giants. He might still, but it would be surprising if he took the Chargers interview with Jim, knowing he could get the Giants job with John.\n\nThe Giants brought in Harbaugh because of his record of success. He is, naturally, going to want to bring in people he knows and has had success with.\n\nMaybe at least wait until the Giants blow a fourth-quarter lead next fall because of a decision Harbaugh makes that backfires before thinking he is a Bozo.",

    "fullText": "The New York Giantsare hiring Dennard Wilson as their new defensive coordinator under head coach John Harbaugh.\n\nThe 43-year-old Wilson most recently served as the Tennessee Titans' defensive coordinator, where he guided the unit to a No. 2 ranking in total defense (311.2 yards per game) and passing defense (177.3 ypg) in his debut play-calling season -- marks not seen since 2000.\n\nA former Ravens defensive backs coach under Harbaugh, Wilson brings proven secondary expertise and schematic discipline to a Giants defense that struggled mightily last year. This reunion aims to spark a much-needed turnaround.\n\nHere's how Giants fans and analysts reacted to the news.\n\nNow that the storm has calmed down I’m genuinely excited for Dennard Wilson as our DC. Leonhard would’ve been a fun big name but I remember how nasty that Titans defense was his first year.

    "fullText": "Random thoughts while waiting on the release of the new Super Bowl commercials.\n\nThe sight of Cubs star Pete-Crow Armstrong and Bears star Caleb Williams hanging out together at the Blackhawks and Bulls games was a nice way to portray Chicago as the biggest small town in America. Los Angeles has its Hollywood culture and New York is the media center of the world, but nowhere are the local sports stars as big a deal as they are in Chicago.\n\nIt’s nothing new, of course. Chicago’s stars have always supported each other. When the Bears played at Wrigley Field, Bobby Hull was a season ticket holder, and Billy Williams used to get tickets for games from Bears receiver Dick Gordon.\n\nThe budding bromance of Crow-Armstrong and Williams should last a long time, or at least until the Cubs and Bears sign them to massive deals.\n\nOne of the primary requisites of the job of commissioner of a major sports league should be the ability to project strength. But the commissioners of the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball are all weaklings, as evidenced by a report from The Athletic that Roger Goodell, Adam Silver, Gary Bettman and Rob Manfred will meet with President Donald Trump to help promote America 250, a celebration of the country’s 250th birthday.\n\nWhile Trump’s jackboots instill fear in Minneapolis, Chicago and other American cities, and he embarrasses the country on the international stage, these four pretend leaders will be posing for photo-ops in the Oval Office and pretending all is right with the country. None of them has the courage to speak out against what’s happening in America.\n\nLucky for them, they’re only beholden to the billionaire owners of their league’s teams, not the average fans who support their respective sports.\n\nESPN’s Pat McAfee has always appealed to the lowest common denominator, so it’s no surprise the clueless commentator is taking on unidentified media members who point out his lame frat boy act, calling them “fat … lazy nerds” on his TV show.\n\nMcAfee also tweeted that sports journalists “hate what sports are for people (happiness). They hate what sports are for society (unifier) … they’re political journalists by nature who’ve preyed on sports because they saw it as an easier path to ‘make it.’ Their days are numbered … my show being broadcasted on ESPN 10 hours a week with ZERO creative say from any ‘journalism school’ puppets is living proof of that.”\n\nActually, the audience of McAfee’s show is relatively tiny, or else it would be in a better time slot than in the early afternoon, when everyone else is working. He’s already wearing thin on college football fans, and sooner or later the ratings will slide and ESPN will pull the plug and send him off to UFC analysis, where he belongs.\n\nIllinois is having another stellar season, thanks to a deep team led by freshman Keaton Wagler. The 11th-ranked Illini are 17-3 after Saturday’s 88-82 road win over Purdue and in contention for the Big Ten title.\n\nAnd when the Illini are winning, coach Brad Underwood is at his most ornery, as when he recently sparred with an Illinois reporter who praised Tomislav Ivišić for a good game against Northwestern despite what he called an “up-and-down season.”\n\n“You guys say he’s been up and down,” Underwood shot back. “I just say his role changed. You guys create more damn narratives that are full of (bleep). That’s what he does. That’s why he’s been on draft boards. He’s big and can shoot the cover off of it. … No one has ever doubted Tommy.”\n\nLove him or hate him, Underwood is never afraid to speak his mind.\n\nKudos to White Sox general manager Chris Getz for immediately spending the $20 million he saved by dumping Luis Robert Jr.’s contract, signing reliever Seranthony Dominguez to a two-year, $20 million deal. Now maybe he can move Grant Taylor into the rotation where he belongs.\n\nMike Berman was a professional and a hardworking sports reporter willing to work long hours at NBC-5. A Glenbrook North alumnus who grew up rooting for Chicago teams, he did his job for 10 years without calling attention to himself. His work spoke for itself.\n\nBerman, who was let go by the station last week, deserved a better fate. Hopefully he winds up on another local station that will appreciate his work ethic.\n\nTerry Boers, who died Friday at age 75, was remembered by most as a radio host and an original member of The Score. But he was also a great newspaperman. Boers and I competed on the Illini basketball beat for one season back in the early 1990s, when he was still at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was as good a beat writer as there was and handed me my lunch on many occasions.\n\nBoers eventually found his way to radio, where he could put his brash personality into his job. He became a legend at WSCR-AM 670, along with the other originals such as Mike North, Tom Shaer and Dan McNeil. There will never be another quite like Boers, which is why his death has brought so many tributes from colleagues.\n\nCubs manager Craig Counsell is a Green Bay Packers fan, but he assured the media he is not a Bears hater. “Look, I grew up a Packers fan for sure,” he said before the Cubs Convention. “The Bears have struggled for a while, and so when a team hasn’t done well for a whole and starts to do well, you see what it does to a city. You feel it. That part of me knows what it’s doing for the city, and you root for that a little bit.”\n\nAsked who would be booed \n\nIt’s a tough call, but my guess is Counsell is still Public Enemy No. 1 among cheeseheads.",

Slowly but surely.\"\n\nThe injury occurred in Week 8 against the Philadelphia Eagles, when Skattebo suffered a dislocated right ankle along with a fibula fracture and deltoid ligament rupture. He underwent surgery shortly after, ending his promising debut season prematurely after seven games.\n\nRecovery milestones have been steady. By early December, Skattebo ditched his scooter and was seen walking into the team facility unaided. Now, approximately 12 weeks post-surgery, the green light to jog marks another significant step.\n\nGiants general manager Joe Schoen recently confirmed Skattebo is fully on track, stating the running back will be ready for the offseason program beginning in April.\n\nSkattebo has remained resolute throughout rehabilitation.\n\n\"I'm going to be back,\" he previously vowed. \"I played seven games in the NFL, and I got hurt.

    "fullText": "Snowfalls can now beget windfalls.\n\nAs Americans rush to buy essentials ahead of Winter Storm Fern, some are also buying shares on prediction markets, like Kalshi and Polymarket, betting on how much snow will fall in New York City.\n\nTraders on Kalshi have bet almost $900,000 as of Saturday afternoon on whether more than 12 inches of snow will fall in New York City on Saturday and Sunday. Meanwhile, on Polymarket, traders have bet about $210,000 on how much snow New York City will see this weekend. The winning category is now 8 to 10 inches.\n\nThe storm is expected to bring heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain to multiple states in the South, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Northeast this weekend. The National Weather Service says the storm could impact some 180 million Americans. Thousands of flights have already been canceled.\n\nPrediction markets allow users to buy and sell shares in the outcomes of future events, such as sports or elections. Polymarket also provides real-time updates, allowing bets to provide insights into how consumers and investors think.\n\nPolymarket bettors correctly predicted nearly the entire slate of Golden Globe winners last week, prompting a celebration from Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan.\n\n\"We have a long way to go to educate the public on the value of market-based forecasts, but you can't deny its accuracy,\" Coplan wrote. \"People have more clarity about the world because Polymarket exists.\"\n\nThe new markets are not strictly regulated, and some bets have looked a lot like insider trading. A last-minute bet on Polymarket earlier this month that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro would be ousted netted strong returns after the US captured Maduro in a surprise raid hours later.\n\nSnowfall totals, on the other hand, are perhaps less susceptible to market manipulation.",

    "title": "4 candidates seem to be the focus of NY Giants’ defensive coordinator search",
    "description": "Let’s take a look at the coaches who seem most likely to run John Harbaugh’s defense.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants are continuing to search for a defensive coordinator for John Harbaugh’s defense. Here is some background on four candidates who are continually mentioned.\n\nThe 45-year-old former Miami Dolphins’ defensive coordinator seems like the leader in the clubhouse for the Giants’ job. Except for all of those pesky head-coaching interviews he keeps getting.\n\nThere are currently five head-coaching openings remaining in this hiring cycle — Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, Arizona Cardinals, Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nWeaver has interest from the Steelers and Bills for their vacancies. He interviewed with the Steelers in-person on Friday. He received an interview request from the Cardinals, but it is not clear that ever took place. He interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons before they hired Kevin Stefanski, and had two interviews with the Baltimore Ravens before they chose Jesse Minter.\n\nWeaver was defensive coordinator of the Houston Texans in 2020, and the Miami Dolphins for the past two seasons. He was in Baltimore working for Harbaugh as defensive line coach for three seasons, 2021-2023.\n\nWeaver started his NFL coaching career in 2012 working under Rex Ryan with the New York Jets. He has also coach with the Cleveland Browns and Buffalo Bills.\n\nWeaver, a defensive tackle as a player, was a second-round pick by the Ravens in 2002 and had a seven-year NFL career with Baltimore and Houston.\n\nThere is no doubt how Harbaugh feels about him. Here is what Harbaugh said about Weaver before the Dolphins hired him away from the Ravens to be defensive coordinator in 2024:\n\nHere’s what Ravens coach John Harbaugh said about Anthony Weaver. He spoke rather glowingly about him.pic.twitter.com/Vf8Ry4YJOv https://t.co/yS1KH9ESBR\n\n— David Furones (@DavidFurones_) February 2, 2024\n\nLeonhard, 43, has never coached for a Harbaugh — John or Jim. He did play for John Harbaugh in 2008, Harbaugh’s first as Ravens’ head coach.\n\nLeonhard played in the NFL for 10 seasons. He coached at Wisconsin from 2016-2022, serving as defensive coordinator beginning in 2017. He joined Sean Payton’s Denver Broncos staff in 2024 and has spent the last two seasons working under Payton and Vance Joseph. He has been defensive backs coach, pass game coordinator, and in 2025 was the Broncos’ assistant head coach.\n\nThe problem for Leonhard might be timing. The Senior Bowl begins on Tuesday in Mobile, Ala., and there is a belief that the Giants would like to have their offensive and defensive coordinators in place by then if possible.\n\nLeonhard’s Broncos play Sunday in the AFC Championship Game. If they win and go to the Super Bowl, that timeline won’t work. Even if they lose, Leonhard would have to interview, be offered and accept the job on Monday and join the Giants’ contingent on Tuesday in Alabama.\n\nThe 43-year-old Wilson is familiar to Harbaugh, and to the Giants. Wilson was Harbaugh’s defensive backs coach in Baltimore in 2023 before becoming Tennessee Titans defensive coordinator for the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Wilson also interviewed for the Giants’ job in 2024, but chose to take the Tennessee job.\n\nWilson’s defenses in Tennessee did not rank highly, but the Titans won just six games in two seasons and Wilson didn’t have a lot to work with.\n\nWilson had a supporter in Tennessee star defender Jeffery Simmons:\n\nJeffery Simmons understands it's not up to him BUT if he has it his way, he'd love to have Dennard Wilson back with the #Titans. pic.twitter.com/Kc4Qhxurko\n\n— TURRON DAVENPORT (@TDavenport_NFL) December 31, 2025\n\nWilson interviewed with the Los Angeles Chargers, coached by Jim Harbaugh, for their defensive coordinator vacancy on Friday.\n\nJones, defensive backs coach and defensive pass game coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings, is probably an underdog for the job.\n\nJones did interview with Harbaugh earlier in the week. He also interviewed for the Giants’ job in 2024.\n\nJones’ NFL resume includes stops with the Miami Dolphins, Cincinnati Bengals, and two stints with the Vikings. Jones has also coached in high school, at the Division II level, in the FCS, FBS, and in the Canadian Football League.\n\nJones has also drawn interest from the Dallas Cowboys , New York Jets, and Green Bay Packers.",

    "fullText": "For some, Mayor Zohran Mamdani has already failed when it comes to what is traditionally a big test for New York City mayors: dealing with a major snowstorm.\n\nThe new mayor is getting roasted online after issuing a warning about the massive snow event that’s coming this weekend, the New York Post reported.\n\n“NYC is forecasted to get 3–16 inches of snow this weekend. And we’re ready,” Mamdani wrote on X on Thursday afternoon as part of a post on the city’s prep for the storm.\n\nNYC is forecasted to get 3–16 inches of snow this weekend. And we’re ready.\n\nWe’ll issue a Code Blue later today, and outreach workers will ramp up efforts to connect unhoused New Yorkers to safe shelter.\n\nTomorrow, we'll begin pre-snow treatment, brining highways and major…\n\n— Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@NYCMayor) January 22, 2026\n\n“3-16, way to narrow down the forecast,” one user on X commented.\n\n“Saying that NYC is going to get between 3 and 16 inches of snow is nonsense,” another said. “That tells you absolutely nothing. Citing numbers with a probability range of 5% to 95% is idiotic and moronic.”\n\n“Maybe they forgot the 1 in front of the 3? Idk?” said another snarky commenter.\n\nThe Post said that the five boroughs were already under a winter storm watch, issued by the National Weather Service, calling for 6-12 inches of snow when Mamdani posted his statement.\n\nCurrent forecasts call for anywhere from 8-14 inches of snow to fall on the city this weekend.\n\nNew York City mayors in the past have been lambasted for poor reactions to snowstorms.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio was scorched in 2014 when Islanders railed that plows and salters were slow to the rescue after a big snowstorm.\n\nMayor John Lindsay got clobbered when the city was slow to react to a 1969 snowstorm.\n\nAnd Mayor Michael Bloomberg took a pounding when the city flubbed the 2010 Christmas blizzard.\n\nThat was the year that Bloomberg pushed back against critics who said that the city was slow to react to the storm, saying that “The city is going fine. Broadway shows were full last night.”",

    "fullText": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Macklin Celebrini had two goals to end his longest drought of the season, pacing the San Jose Sharks to a 3-1 win over the New York Rangers on Friday night.\n\nCelebrini’s 25th and 26th goals of the season were his first since Jan. 7, a six-game stretch.\n\nThe No. 1 overall pick in 2024, Celebrini had a chance for his third hat trick of the season but his shot in the third period was stopped by Rangers goalie Martin Spencer and the puck rolled slowly to the side of the net.\n\nPavol Regenda added his eighth goal for the Sharks while Will Smith and Collin Graf each had two assists. Alex Nedeljkovic made 28 saves.\n\nSam Carrick had his second goal in six games for New York, which lost its third straight and is now 2-8-1 over its last 11 games.\n\nCelebrini got the Sharks on the board quickly with a power-play goal 1:09 into the first period. Celebrini got positioned in front of the Islanders net and scored off a quick pass from Tyler Toffoli.\n\nSan Jose added a second power-play goal less than two minutes later when Regenda flipped a backhand shot that went over Martin’s left shoulder. Michael Misa and Graf assisted.\n\nCelebrini scored his second goal of the night at the 7:37 mark in the first period. Chants of “MVP MVP” for the 19-year-old broke out moments later.\n\nCarrick’s goal was his third of the season for the Rangers. Taylor Raddysh and Anton Blidh assisted.

    "fullText": "Aaron Glenn is searching for a new defensive coordinator for his second season with the Jets. Here's the latest on that search...\n\nThe Jets are moving on from a number of coaches, including QB coach Charles London, DL coach Eric Washington, LB coach Aaron Curry and pass game coordinator Scott Turner.\n\nSNY's Connor Hughes said on the latest episode of Jets Final Drive that players had \"a lot\" of issues with Washington and Curry, but Turner being relieved comes as a surprise.\n\nWith the mid-season release of DC Steve Wilks, Jets coach Aaron Glenn has now relieved five coaches of their duties.\n\nThe Jets were busy in the second week of their offseason, completing a first round of interviews for eight candidates for the vacant DC job.\n\nThe team announced that they completed virtual interviews with Wink Martindale, Jim Leonhard, Chris Harris, Jim O'Neil, DeMarcus Covington, Daronte Jones, Mathieu Araujo, and Ephraim Banda.\n\nMartindale is the most senior of the group at 65 years old and has the most experience as a defensive coordinator at the NFL level. Recently, the DC at Michigan, he worked last in the NFL with the Giants, where he had a rocky relationship with then-head coach Brian Daboll. Martindale also held the DC job for four seasons in Baltimore and one in Denver.\n\nLeonhard started 40 games over three seasons as a safety for the Jets. After finishing a 10-year playing career, he entered coaching, spending several years at his alma mater, Wisconsin. He was the DC with the Badgers from 2017-22, finishing as the interim head coach for the last seven games. He made the jump to the NFL in 2024 with another of his former teams, the Broncos, where he's been a defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator for the past two seasons, adding assistant head coach to his title this year.\n\nHarris was hired to Glenn's staff last offseason to be the defensive back coach and passing game coordinator, but finished as interim DC after Steve Wilks' firing. Before coming to New York, the eight-year NFL veteran was Washington's defensive backs coach (2020-22) and Tennessee's DBs coach and passing game coordinator (2023-24).\n\nO'Neil has experience with Glenn in Detroit, where he's worked as a defensive assistant since 2024. He got his first NFL gig with the Jets in 2009 as a defensive quality control coach before serving as assistant DBs coach from 2010-12. He was Cleveland's defensive coordinator for two seasons (2014-15), along with NFL stops in Buffalo (2013), San Francisco (2016), Oakland/Las Vegas (2019-20).\n\nCovington also has experience working as a DC in the NFL, holding that position with New England during the 2024 season.

He is in his second season in New York after being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves before last season.\n\nTowns' max contract is fully guaranteed through the 2027-28 season, making him a difficult player to trade.

    "fullText": "There is no tougher runner in the NFL right now than Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry.\n\nThe future Hall of Famer is currently the NFL's leader in touchdowns (127) and rushing yards (13,018) among active players, and his highlight reel is filled with defenders bouncing off his invincible body.\n\nHenry began his career in Tennessee and moved to Baltimore two years ago to better his chances at a Super Bowl and played those two seasons under head coach John Harbaugh, who was fired last week by the Ravens after 18 seasons.\n\n“I love Coach. He’s a great leader,\" Henry told The Escapist in a recent interview. \"Enjoyed my time with him in Baltimore. Kind of sad that it ended while I came to Baltimore, but I wish Coach the best. I definitely appreciate everything that he’s taught us and taught me through these last two years of me being a new guy.”\n\nHarbaugh has naturally moved on to the New York Giants to become their new head coach.\n\nHenry, the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner and five-time Pro Bowler, was asked how Harbaugh treats his players. His answer should delight the Giants and their fans.\n\n“He’s had a great philosophy about how he ran the organization and how he treated the players,\" Henry said. \"After we won, he would point out every single player that had an impact on the game. Even if it doesn’t get noticed nationally, he made sure that they’re appreciated throughout the organization for the effort that they put into the team.”\n\nBut, more importantly, Harbaugh will bring structure and discipline back to the Giants. After 10 double-digit losing seasons over the past 12 years, the Giants and their fans are finally getting a coach deserving of the title.\n\n\"As we begin a new chapter in New York, our focus is simple,\" Harbaugh said in his introductory press conference with th Giants this week, \"it starts with building a team that is physical and tough, that's capable of overwhelming their opponent from beginning to end, and especially at the end, that understands how to finish, that is smart and disciplined, that plays the game the way it should be played, and that everybody watching it, including those playing it, would be proud of.\n\n\"We're going to work together. We have great and talented people to accomplish a shared mission. There will be a relentless commitment to this organization, to this city and the fans to do things the right way every single day. Nothing will be taken for granted. It will always, always be all about the team. The team, the team, the team. Thanks, Dad, for that. It'll always be about that. Now it's time to go to work.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Derrick Henry: New York Giants' John Harbaugh 'a great leader'",

    "description": "An expedition off the coast of Massachusetts has confirmed the existence of a freshwater reservoir beneath the seafloor. Now, scientists are starting to understand when and how it formed.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA giant reservoir of \"secret\" fresh water off the East Coast that could potentially supply a city the size of New York City for 800 years may have formed during the last ice age, when the region was covered in glaciers, researchers say.\n\nPreliminary analyses suggest the reservoir, which sits beneath the seafloor and appears to stretch from offshore New Jersey as far north as Maine, was locked in place under frigid conditions around 20,000 years ago, hinting that it formed in the last glacial period due, partly, to thick ice sheets.\n\nLast summer, researchers went on an expedition to follow up on reports from the late 1960s and early 1970s of fresh water beneath the seafloor off the East Coast. \"It was quite the project and sort of a lifelong dream,\" Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist and a professor of geophysics at the Colorado School of Mines, told Live Science.\n\nThe research voyage, known as Expedition 501, lasted three months and dredged up 13,200 gallons (50,000 liters) of water from beneath the seafloor in three locations off the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. The results aren't finalized yet, but so far it looks as if the reservoir might stretch farther underground than early reports suggested, meaning it might be even bigger than previously thought.\n\nDugan and his colleagues also think they know what created the reservoir thanks to preliminary radiocarbon, noble gas and isotope analyses, he said.\n\nFresh water in the region was first reported 60 years ago by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), during offshore mineral and energy resource assessments between Florida and Maine. \"In a very peculiar way, they found fresh water in the sediment beneath the ocean,\" Dugan said. \"In the 1980s, some of the USGS people came up with ideas of how that fresh water could get there. Then it went quiet for a while — no one was talking about it.\"\n\nIn 2003, Dugan and Mark Person, a professor of hydrology at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, rediscovered these records and came up with three ideas of how fresh water can end up beneath the ocean. One way that a submarine freshwater reservoir can form is if sea levels are very low for a long time and rainfall seeps into the ground. Then, when sea levels rise again over hundreds of thousands of years, that fresh water gets trapped in the underlying sediment, Dugan said.\n\nA second possibility is that tall mountains close to the ocean funnel rainwater directly down into the seabed from their high elevation point, he said. And thirdly — related to the first hypothesis — a freshwater reservoir can form under the ocean if ice sheets expand, causing sea levels to drop. Meltwater collects at the bottom of ice sheets because they grind against the bedrock, producing heat. The huge weight of the ice sheet then pushes that water into the ground, trapping it beneath layers of sediment.\n\nMore than two decades later, the researchers are finally close to getting an answer, with preliminary data indicating that most of the fresh water came from glaciers some time during the last ice age (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). \"We kind of ruled out the large topography for New England, because we don't have big mountains next to the coast,\" Dugan said. However, \"there might be a rainfall component\" blended in the glacier water, he said. \"You can imagine that in front of a glacier you have rainfall, so it's probably a mixed system.\"\n\nExpedition 501 extracted water samples from sites 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast of Massachusetts. The researchers drilled down to 1,300 feet (400 meters) below the seafloor, which was deep enough to reveal a thick layer of sediment engorged with fresh water sitting beneath a layer of salty sediment and an impermeable \"seal\" of clay and silt.\n\n\"We have a seal at the top [of the fresh water] that keeps the seawater above from the fresh water below,\" Dugan said. This seal is strong enough to separate the two layers now, but it wasn't robust enough to stop a glacier from forcing water down through it — if that is what happened. \"Whatever emplaced that water didn't care if there was a seal. There was enough energy to flush it with fresh water,\" he said.\n\nSalinity measurements showed that water freshness in the reservoir drops with distance from the shore, but it stays well below ocean salinity in the areas studied last summer. The drill site closest to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard had a salt content of 1 part per 1,000, which is the maximum safe limit for drinking water. Farther offshore, salt content was 4 to 5 parts per 1,000, and at the farthest site, the researchers recorded 17 to 18 parts per 1,000 — or about half of the ocean's average salt content.\n\n—1.2 billion-year-old groundwater is some of the oldest on Earth\n\n—Scientists discover enormous reservoir hidden in Cascades — more than twice the amount of water in Lake Mead\n\n—Enough fresh water is lost from continents each year to meet the needs of 280 million people. Here's how we can combat that.\n\n\"The important part was we collected all the samples we need to address our primary questions,\" Dugan said. \"When we're done drilling and we pull our equipment out, the holes collapse back in and seal themselves up.\"\n\nNow, scientists are studying the reservoir in finer detail, including any microbes, rare earth elements, pore space — which can help researchers better estimate the reservoir's size — and the age of the sediments, which will help narrow down when it formed. More definitive results about how and when the reservoir formed are expected in about one month's time, Dugan said.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide an understanding of the system so if and when somebody needs to use it, they have information to start from, rather than recreating information or making an ill-informed choice,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — In two decades of kicking in doors for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Joseph Bongiovanni often took on the risks of being the “lead breacher,\" meaning he was the first person into the room.\n\nOn Wednesday, he felt a familiar uncertainty awaiting sentencing for using his DEA badge to protect childhood friends who became prolific drug traffickers in Buffalo, New York.\n\n“I never knew what was on the other side of that door — that fear is what I feel today,” Bongiovanni, 61, told a federal judge, pounding the defense table as his face reddened with emotion. “I've always been innocent. I loved that job.”\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Lawrence J. Vilardo sentenced the disgraced lawman to five years in federal prison on a string of corruption counts. The punishment was significantly less than the 15 years prosecutors sought even after a jury acquitted Bongiovanni of the most serious charges he faced, including an allegation he pocketed $250,000 in bribes from the Mafia.\n\nThe judge said the sentence reflected the complexity of the mixed verdicts following two lengthy trials and the almost Jekyll-and-Hyde nature of Bongiovanni's career, in which the lawman racked up enough front-page accolades to fill a trophy case.\n\nBongiovanni once hurtled into a burning apartment building to evacuate residents through billowing smoke. He locked up drug dealers, including the first ever prosecuted in the region for causing a fatal overdose.\n\n“There are two completely polar opposite versions of the facts and polar opposite versions of the defendant,” Vilardo said, assuring prosecutors five years behind bars would pose a considerable hardship to someone who has never been to prison.\n\nDefense attorney Parker MacKay noted the judge had acknowledged Bongiovanni as a “beacon” of the Buffalo community. The government's request for a 15-year sentence, he added, was “completely unmoored to the nature of the convictions.”\n\n“As Mr. Bongiovanni told the judge at sentencing, he is innocent, and we look forward to continuing to work with him to prove that,” MacKay told The Associated Press.\n\nA jury in 2024 convicted Bongiovanni of four counts of obstruction of justice, counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and making false statements to law enforcement.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's “little dark secret” caused immeasurable damage over 11 years. They likened him to Jose Irizarry, a disgraced former DEA agent serving a 12-year federal sentence after confessing to laundering money for Colombian drug cartels.\n\nBongiovanni upheld an oath not to the DEA, they argued, but to organized crime figures in the tight-knit Italian American community of his North Buffalo upbringing. During sentencing, Bongiovanni’s family dissolved into tears on the front row of the packed courtroom in downtown Buffalo.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's corruption involved as much inaction as calculated coverup. They pointed to a turning point in 2008 when Bongiovanni could have acted on intelligence about traffickers he knew whose operation would evolve into a large-scale organization with links to California, Vancouver, and New York City.\n\nHe also was accused of authoring bogus DEA reports, stealing sensitive files, throwing off colleagues, outing confidential informants, covering for a sex-trafficking strip club and helping a high school English teacher keep his marijuana-growing side hustle. Prosecutors said he brazenly urged colleagues to spend less time investigating Italians and focus instead on Black and Hispanic people.\n\n“His conduct shook the foundation of law enforcement — and this community — to its core,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi told the judge. “That's what a betrayal is.”\n\nThe ex-agent's downfall came amid a sex-trafficking prosecution that took sensational turns, including an implicated judge who killed himself after the FBI raided his home, law enforcement dragging a pond in search of an overdose victim and dead rats planted outside the home of a government witness who prosecutors allege was later killed by a fatal dose of fentanyl.\n\nIt also involved the Pharoah’s Gentlemen’s Club outside Buffalo. Bongiovanni was childhood friends with the strip club’s owner, Peter Gerace Jr., who authorities say has close ties to both the Buffalo Mafia and the violent Outlaws Motorcycle Club. A separate jury convicted Gerace of a sex trafficking conspiracy and of paying bribes to Bongiovanni.\n\nThe prosecution also cast a harsh light on the DEA after a string of corruption scandals prompted at least 17 agents brought up on federal charges over the past decade. Last month, prosecutors charged another former agent with conspiring to launder millions of dollars and obtain military-grade firearms and explosives for a Mexican drug cartel.\n\nFrank Tarentino, the DEA’s northeast associate chief of operations, said Bongiovanni’s sentence “sends a powerful message that those who betray their badge will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”",

    "title": "Bo Bichette explains why Mets were ‘obvious’ choice in free agency",
    "description": "Bo Bichette was introduced by the Mets at Citi Field on Wednesday after signing with New York in free agency.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK — The image of the Dodgers pouring out onto the field at Rogers Centre, celebrating a victory over the Blue Jays in Game 7 of the World Series last fall, will be ingrained in Bo Bichette’s mind forever.\n\nHe still hasn’t gotten over the end of that game — and the Blue Jays’ remarkable playoff run — in the months since.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bichette was in a new jersey, introduced to his new team, in a new city. And, in some ways, he was able to relieve that pain from November.\n\nHe firmly believes that his new team, the Mets, will give him an opportunity to get back to that stage again, as early as this year, with a real chance to finish the job this time around.\n\nThat, Bichette said, was part of what tipped the scales in his negotiations with multiple teams in free agency. It’s what made it “very obvious” that he wanted to be a Met.\n\n“My first priority is winning,” Bichette said, donning his No. 19 Mets jersey for the first time. “This organization is doing everything they can to do that.”\n\nBo Bichette was asked today how long it took for him to get over Game 7 of the World Series with the Blue Jays:\n\n\"I don't know if I have yet. This is probably helping. But yeah, to be that close, you never know when you're gonna get that opportunity again, but I think this team…\n\n— Max Goodman (@MaxTGoodman) January 21, 2026\n\nBichette signed a three-year deal with the Mets last week, a $126 million pact that contains opt-outs after both his first and second seasons. It was reported that Bichette was close to a seven year, $200 million deal with the rival Phillies, but he chose the Mets hours later.\n\nWhen asked on Wednesday if he is treating his contract with the Mets as a one-year deal, one of Bichette’s agents — Greg Genske — chimed in.\n\n“His commitment is to the Mets,” Genske said. “His desire is to be here. His desire is compete for championships here.”\n\nMany fans will question that logic. The Mets missed the playoffs in 2025 and seemingly took steps back during the first half of this offseason. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, were two outs away from winning the World Series in the ninth inning of Game 7 less than three months ago. They won their division last season and advanced to the Fall Classic without Bichette, who was sidelined by a left knee sprain that kept him out until the World Series. Toronto has been active in bolstering their roster this winter. Plus, other high-spending contenders — like the Phillies — were contenders in the Bichette sweepstakes.\n\nBichette’s reasoning is rooted in the actions of owner Steve Cohen and Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns. He thinks the Mets have a roster that supports their offseason initiative to turn this franchise into a true perennial championship contender.\n\n“Mr. Cohen and David have put together an organization that is looking to win every single year, has an opportunity to win a World Series every single year and a roster that backs that up,” Bichette said. “It’s very exciting to be a part of this city, one of the best cities in the world — maybe the best city in the world. The fans, some of the best fans in the world. All of that is something I’ve always wanted to be a part of.\"\n\nThat’s part of the calculus in Bichette’s willingness to change positions heading into the 2026 season, too. He’ll be moving from shortstop to third base with the Mets, something he was open to throughout his dip into free agency, so long as he was signing with a team that gave him a good chance to win.\n\n“I’m excited for the challenge,” Bichette said. “It’s just like anything else, it’s gonna take work to be good at something. I’m willing to put in that work and we’ll get after it.”\n\nBichette will land in the middle of a formidable lineup that includes Fransisco Lindor, Juan Soto, Marcus Semien and Luis Robert, Jr., whom the Mets acquired Tuesday night in a trade with the White Sox.\n\nStearns isn’t concerned about Bichette being used at the hot corner for the first time in his professional career. He trusts that Bichette’s range at shortstop will translate to third and that he can handle the longer throws. Stearns has been prioritizing run prevention and defensive improvements all winter. Even with Jorge Polanco making a similar transition this year to now starting at first base for the Mets, Stearns is confident in this new-look group (with Semien at second and Lindor returning at shortstop).\n\n“There are going to be certain days this season, probably a lot of days this season, where we’re playing four shortstops on the infield, and that’s a pretty distinct advantage,” Stearns said. “The majority of that learning curve is going to be where to be on certain plays. Frankly, some things that may not be completely perceptible. We’re probably going to make a mistake or two. But we’re also going to have elite range around the infield and that’s pretty exciting.”\n\nBichette singled out positioning, bunt plays and a new type of throw across the diamond as the biggest challenges of this transition. Mets manager Carlos Mendoza, who will play a key role in helping Bichette with his defense this spring, has faith that the 27-year-old can pull it off.\n\n“It’s a different angle that you could take from there,” Mendoza said, “But he’s athletic and has work ethic, a lot of the things that will make the transition hopefully a lot smoother.”",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — From hitting in the clutch to testing free agency, Bo Bichette has soaked up plenty of baseball advice from his big league dad over the years.\n\nDante Bichette doesn't have much to offer about handling the hot corner, though.\n\nAfter signing a $126 million, three-year contract with the New York Mets, the younger Bichette was formally introduced by the team Wednesday and pulled on a No. 19 jersey at a packed Citi Field news conference.\n\nA two-time All-Star shortstop with the Toronto Blue Jays, Bichette will shift to third base with the Mets, who have Francisco Lindor entrenched at shortstop. Bichette said he hasn't played third since travel ball as a teenager.\n\n“I’m excited for the challenge. I mean, it’s just like anything else: It’s going to take work to be good at something, and I’m willing to put in that work and we’ll get after it,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there’s different positioning, different plays you have to deal with at third base that I’m going to have to get used to and learn, but I think that’s all attainable.”\n\nDante Bichette, in attendance Wednesday along with other family members, was a four-time All-Star outfielder from 1988-2001. Known much more for his bat than glove, he played one inning at third base for Milwaukee in 1991.\n\n“I didn’t know he did that. I had no idea,\" Bo Bichette said with a grin. \"That would be interesting to watch.”\n\nHousehold jabs aside, the new-look Mets are confident Bichette can make the switch successfully.\n\nHe didn't grade well at shortstop last year, and Bichette entered free agency this offseason willing to move to second or third. He plans to call former Toronto teammate Matt Chapman, a five-time Gold Glove winner at the hot corner, to get some thoughts about manning third.\n\n“This is a player who is universally respected for his aptitude and his work ethic on the field,\" Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said about Bichette. \"And so when you combine those two things it generally gives you comfort that they can make adjustments, make changes, and Bo is very confident that he’s going to be able to do this, and everything we’ve seen backs that up.”\n\nBichette spurned the NL East rival Philadelphia Phillies to sign with the Mets and gives them a proven hitter with a potent right-handed bat to help complement lefty slugger Juan Soto.\n\nBichette batted .311 with 18 home runs, 94 RBIs and an .840 OPS in 139 games last year for the Blue Jays, who fell one win short of a World Series title.\n\nHe hit a three-run homer off Shohei Ohtani in Game 7 of the Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and is a .330 career hitter with runners in scoring position — the third-best mark in the majors among qualified hitters since 2019.\n\nBichette batted .381 with RISP last season.\n\n“I don’t know if my eyes light up or anything like that, but definitely probably get a little bit more focus,\" he said. \"And my dad taught me a lot about it. That’s all I heard about growing up was driving in runs, so I’ve put a lot of work into it.”\n\nBichette, who turns 28 in March, gets a $40 million signing bonus payable March 15 and a $2 million salary this year. He has $42 million player options for 2027 and 2028. If he declines either option, he would receive a $5 million buyout, payable in $1 million installments each July 1 from 2036-40.\n\n“We had a lot of conversations about the different structure of the deal, and Bo had his choice of long-term deals, shorter-term deals, opt outs,\" agent Greg Genske said. “His priority was finding a place where he felt like he could get better as a player and have a chance to compete for championships.”\n\nNew York signed right-handed reliever Luis García to a $1.75 million, one-year contract. He can earn $1.25 million in performance bonuses for games pitched: $100,000 for 25, $150,000 each for 30 and 35, $175,000 for 40, $200,000 for 45, $225,000 for 50 and $250,000 for 55.\n\nGarcía, who turns 39 this month, went 2-2 with a 3.42 ERA and two saves in 58 combined appearances last season with the Dodgers, Nationals and Angels. He is 28-30 with a 4.07 ERA and 17 saves in 13 major league seasons.\n\nTo open a spot for García on the 40-man roster, infielder Tsung-Che Cheng was designated for assignment.\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump knows he's aligning himself with the progressive left when it comes to credit cards.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen in Davos on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that his call for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates isn't a standard conservative policy.\n\nIn fact, he joked that it's something that New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, might have come up with.\n\n\"I know it's sort of like… it sounds like the mayor of New York maybe came up with that,\" Trump said with a laugh.\n\nFollowing Mamdani's election in November, the two met in the Oval Office and appeared to share some common ground in remarks to the press afterwards.\n\n\"I'm conservative, but I think I'm common sense, you know?\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"People say, 'Are you a conservative?' I say, 'Yeah, but I'm a common-sense person.' I mean, I do things that aren't necessarily that conservative sometimes.\"\n\nTrump said he respected credit card companies but that consumers can't afford to pay high rates.\n\n\"Whatever happened to usury? They can't pay 28%,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump called on Congress to pass a bill capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\n\nKey Republicans in Congress have been cool to that idea, with House Speaker Mike Johnson telling reporters last week that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy and that credit card companies may \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nMany business leaders have also been critical of the idea.\n\nYet Trump's call has also been met with agreement from some progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom Trump called last week.\n\nIn Congress, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill that would do just what Trump said, capping credit card rates at 10% for a year.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kevin Fiala had a goal and an assist, and Anton Forsberg made 28 saves after taking over for the injured Darcy Kuemper in the Los Angeles Kings’ 4-3 victory over the slumping New York Rangers on Tuesday night.\n\nAdrian Kempe, Taylor Ward and Andrei Kuzmenko also scored for the Kings, who snapped a four-game skid with only their second regulation victory in January.\n\nKuemper allowed two goals on eight shots before abruptly leaving with 38 seconds left in the first period following a collision in the crease with a charging Jonny Brodzinski.\n\nForsberg played superbly after taking over for Kuemper, a member of Canada’s Olympic roster. Kuemper also missed 2 1/2 weeks last month after taking a hit to the head during a loss at Dallas.\n\nJ.T. Miller scored two goals for the Rangers, who are last in the Eastern Conference after losing seven of eight.\n\nJonathan Quick made 23 saves in his third start and fourth appearance against the Kings, who drafted him in 2005. Quick, who turns 40 years old on Wednesday, won 370 games — 199 more than any other Kings goalie — while backstopping the club to two Stanley Cup championships during his 16 seasons in LA.\n\nKempe scored 18 seconds after the opening faceoff.\n\nOnly 42 seconds after Will Cuylle’s goal for New York, Fiala scored his 18th goal by intercepting an unwise pass by former Kings teammate Vladislav Gavrikov.\n\nMiller evened it again late in the first off Mika Zibanejad’s pass.\n\nWard put the Kings back ahead early in the second, banking in a skittering shot off Quick’s far post for his first goal of the season. After Los Angeles killed a five-on-three disadvantage for 96 seconds, Kuzmenko backhanded home a rebound of Fiala’s shot.\n\nMiller scored his 13th goal in the final seconds with Quick pulled for an extra attacker.\n\nRangers: At San Jose on Friday.\n\nKings: At St. Louis on Saturday to open a six-game road trip.",

    "description": "Taking a look at a Jets pass rusher",
    "fullText": "Over the next few months, we’ll be taking an in-depth look at some of the late season signings who are under contract for 2026, and futures signings after the end of the season. We continue today with edge defender Ochaun Mathis, who was added to the practice squad late last year and signed a futures deal after the season.\n\nThe 27-year old Mathis is listed at 6’5″ and 260 pounds and was a sixth round pick out of Nebraska in 2023 having also played at TCU. He has played 14 NFL games, recording five tackles, a quarterback hit and a forced fumble.\n\nMathis was a three-star high school recruit and headed to TCU where he played four games in 2018 and then redshirted.\n\nOver the next three seasons, he started 34 games and had over 40 tackles in each season with a total of 30 tackles for loss and 16 sacks. His best season, for which he earned second team all-Big 12 recognition, was 2020, in which he had 9.5 sacks in 10 games. However, he also earned second team recognition in 2021.\n\nAfter the 2021 season, Mathis entered the transfer portal and opted to move to Nebraska. However, he was mostly in a rotational role with the Cornhuskers, starting just two games. He was productive, though, with a career-high 48 tackles and 3.5 sacks.\n\nMathis attended the 2023 scouting combine, after which he was rated as a potential late-round pick and ended up getting selected in the sixth round by the Rams.\n\nAfter a training camp injury meant he missed preseason and the start of the regular season, Mathis struggled to crack the rotation. He ultimately made eight appearances as a rookie and had just two tackles and a hit.\n\nIn 2024, he was among the Rams’ final cuts and ended up on New England’s practice squad from where he made it onto their active roster and had two tackles and a forced fumble in five appearances. However, he was released in November.\n\nThe Eagles then signed Mathis to their practice squad and he made one appearance, with one tackle, down the stretch.\n\nHe did not play in the NFL this season, despite spending time with the Eagles, Titans and Browns. The Jets signed him to their practice squad in late December but did not elevate him for any games. They did sign him to a futures deal after the season, though.\n\nLet’s move onto some more in-depth analysis of what Mathis brings to the table as a player, based on extensive research and film study.\n\nMathis has an average sized frame but terrific length and some of his combine numbers were good. He ran a 4.73 in the 40-yard dash and posted 21 bench press reps, along with above average explosiveness and agility numbers. He improved his broad jump by another five inches at his pro day.\n\nThere are times on film when it is apparent he could benefit from adding some strength.\n\nMathis has primarily played on the edge, both in four-man fronts (at TCU) and as an outside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme (at Nebraska), so he has plenty of experience of playing both with his hands in the dirt and standing up.\n\nHe also played off the ball at times, but did not play inside, although he sometimes lined up across from an opposing tackle.\n\nMathis brings high energy and effort in pursuit and in the trenches, with many of his sacks coming as a result of relentlessness meaning he eventually gets home for a coverage sack rather than beating someone clean.\n\nMathis posted an impressive 9.5 sacks in 10 games in 2020 but otherwise had just 10 in 40 other games in his career. In addition, his pressure rates were fairly consistent but nothing special. He hasn’t had much success in NFL regular season or preseason action either, other than a few flashes.\n\nAs a pass rusher, he showcases a decent get-off and can bend the edge to a degree.\n\nHe is someone who can be effective on interior rushes if standing up at the line or stunting inside.\n\nHowever, NFL linemen have typically been able to stay in front of him or redirect him upfield.\n\nMathis is a decent run defender, who can pursue downhill and plays with good discipline on the edge.\n\nHe can be controlled and sealed off by opposing tackles on the edge but has the physicality to take on lead blockers.\n\nMathis is relentless in pursuit, with good closing speed and an ability to extend beyond his frame to wrap up and drag down ball carriers.\n\nHe averaged just over five missed tackles per season in college with eight being the most he ever had in a season.\n\nHe can make some hard hits but had one forced fumble in his college career although he has had another in the NFL.\n\nMathis doesn’t necessary showcase a mastery of a variety of pass rushing moves, but his 35.5-inch arms give him a good foundation to work with and he’s shown signs of being able to exploit a length advantage at times.\n\nHe could probably benefit from sharpening up his footwork to disguise his rush and honing his technique when ripping through as he comes around the edge, but he shows some ability to vary up his rush speed.\n\nMathis hasn’t dropped into coverage that often but he does do it from time to time and is probably more experienced at doing so than most edge defenders at this level, unless they converted from another position.\n\nMost of his six career pass breakups come from getting his hands up to deflect passes; something which he is adept at. However, on this play, despite not getting his head turned, he did a great job of staying with the back to save a potential big play.\n\nHe also intercepted a pass on a two-point conversion attempt, early on in a game TCU ultimately won 34-32.\n\nMost of Mathis’ experience on special teams has been rushing kicks, with his athletic ability on display on this field goal block.\n\nHe also made this special teams tackle and forced a fumble in kickoff coverage during 2024 regular season action.\n\nMathis’ discipline and play recognition seem sound but he perhaps lacks natural pass rushing instincts in terms of transitioning to a counter move when his initial rush is repelled.\n\nHe shows versatility and makes a great play here as he blows up the blocker to bottle up a receiver screen.\n\nHe has jumped offside a few times during his college career.\n\nMathis is regarded as a player who works hard to improve and studies and prepares hard. While he wasn’t a team captain, he is a hard worker who sets a good example. Mathis’ high school team never had a winning season, and he has played with a chip on his shoulder since then, feeling he has gone under the radar.\n\nOn-field discipline is not a major concern as he has no penalties at the NFL level and just nine in his college career, five of which were in 2021.\n\nMathis was carted off with a knee injury during training camp in his rookie season and began the season on injured reserve, although he returned to action in October. He otherwise hasn’t had to deal with major injury issues.\n\nUntil we know who the defensive coordinator is, we can’t say for sure if Mathis will be a good fit for the system, but the Jets obviously targeted him and retained him because he fits some of the things Aaron Glenn likes to do and, as noted, he played on teams with both three and four-man fronts so should be adaptable.\n\nIt’s not impossible he could have the skill-set to be considered for a position switch into an off-ball role, but that would be a long-term project.\n\nHe was a teammate of current Jets cornerback Samuel Womack in Tennessee and offensive lineman Liam Fornadel in New England.\n\nMathis has shown a few brief glimpses of his talent since being drafted but is yet to prove he can crack an NFL rotation or that he has the ability to be productive at this level if given an opportunity.\n\nNevertheless, the Jets presumably liked his potential as a draft prospect and, having brought him in for a look, opted to retain him on a futures deal – something which was far from automatic with the players on the practice squad at the end of the season.\n\nWith his combination of length and athleticism, Mathis has looked like a player who would really benefit from adding some strength and refining his technique. He’s been in the league long enough now that he needs to make an impact in camp or preseason for the organization to be compelled to keep him in their plans.",

    "description": "The New York Giants formally introduced John Harbaugh as their head coach on Tuesday, and here are nine takeaways from his press conference.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants formally introduced John Harbaugh as the 21st head coach in franchise history on Tuesday afternoon at the Quest Diagnostics Training Center in East Rutherford.\n\nThe press conference, held inside the fieldhouse, was a well-attended event, featuring the Mara, Tisch, and Koch families, as well as the Harbaugh family, general manager Joe Schoen, current and former Giants players, and an abundance of reporters.\n\nHarbaugh was introduced by Schoen and then fielded questions for roughly 20 minutes.\n\nHere are nine takeaways from the Harbaugh introductory press conference.\n\nLeading up to Harbaugh signing his contract, many reports indicated that the reporting structure served as a main cog in negotiations. In the end, Schoen and the Giants agreed that Harbaugh would report directly to ownership -- namely, CEO John Mara.\n\nHowever, Harbaugh appeared to dismiss that on Tuesday, calling the reports \"overblown.\"\n\n\"It's really not that important,\" he said. \"It's overblown just a little bit in terms of how it works... We all report to the boss, right? And the boss is ownership. And John Mara is running football operations -- and he's running it -- and I'm glad he is.\"\n\nHarbaugh made it abundantly clear that everything will be football-focused under his leadership. And while that may sound like an obvious statement, the Giants have found ways to get a bit distracted in recent years.\n\n\"To me, the number one thing is that we have to have guys that love football,\" he said. \"It's football. What are we here for? What do we do? What is this building here for? It's football.\"\n\nHarbaugh noted that everyone on the team had better love all aspects of football, from weightlifting to practice to film study, and if they don't, they can go play somewhere else.\n\nHarbaugh mentioned his father, Jack Harbaugh, several times throughout the press conference, attributing several quotes and processes to his old man.\n\nJohn Harbaugh was asked what he sees when he looks at the Giants' roster and he says his dad told him he was impressed by what he saw from the team on tape:\n\n\"When my dad told me, I knew it was true.\" pic.twitter.com/qUPBJH5w2I\n\n— Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) January 20, 2026\n\nDespite reports that several candidates had reservations about Schoen -- including Harbaugh himself -- the head coach came away \"impressed\" after multiple conversations with the GM.\n\n\"You get to know Joe, and we started talking ball, and what you see is a football man. This guy lives and breathes football,\" Harbaugh said. \"His knowledge is deep. He knows the league. . . He was impressive to me.\"\n\nHarbaugh went on to describe their conversations as a \"joy.\"\n\nHarbaugh has not shied away from what he expects of these Giants, and that's winning on Day 1 with sights set on another Super Bowl championship... And then several more.\n\n\"I know the challenges, and I understand the expectations. And I know the fans are hungry for a winner,\" he said. \"We're here with one mission: To earn the right to be called World Champions in New York.\"\n\n\"I'm planning on Day 1. That's what we'll be shooting for, working for... I fully expect it to happen.\"\n\nWhen Harbaugh spoke, you could hear some of Tom Coughlin in his messaging. He shares a similar mindset, which is what fans and players have been yearning for since Coughlin walked out the door a decade ago.\n\n\"Nothing will be taken for granted. It will always, always be all about the team. The team, the team, the team,\" he said. \"It will always be about that. Now it's time to go to work.\"\n\nHarbaugh doesn't just want the Giants to win; he wants them to dismantle and overwhelm opponents for 60 full minutes every single week.\n\n\"Our focus is simple: It starts with building a team that is physical and tough; that is capable of overwhelming their opponent from beginning to end -- especially at the end,\" he said. \"That understands how to finish; that is smart and disciplined. That plays the game the way it should be played. And that everybody watching it -- including those playing it -- would be proud of.\n\nThese are not the New York Giants; they are the New York Football Giants.\n\n\"The New York FOOTBALL Giants\" pic.twitter.com/j7VQ9D0S9Z\n\n— Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) January 20, 2026\n\n\"It's a profound honor to be entrusted with the responsibility of coaching the New York Giants Football Giants,\" he said. \"My Dad taught me that they were the New York Football Giants. They weren't just the Giants, they were the New York Football Giants.\"\n\nHarbaugh was comfortable at the podium, and he offered very little fluff. It was 20-plus minutes of pure substance, with one single quote coming across as the most important.\n\n\"I want this job,\" Harbaugh said emphatically.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 9 takeaways from Giants coach John Harbaugh's introductory press conference",

    "fullText": "Robert Saleh’s impending tenure as Tennessee Titans head coach comes with an unusual wrinkle for the franchise: He plans to call defensive plays himself, a responsibility he did not carry as head coach of the New York Jets.\n\nNew #Titans HC Robert Saleh indicated to teams in interviews that he plans to call defensive plays in his next stop as HC, per sources. \n\nThat wasn’t the case in his #Jets tenure. https://t.co/9hjhYCjkh7 pic.twitter.com/TtdMqrn1AA\n\n— Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) January 20, 2026\n\nSaleh’s decision to take on defensive play-calling signals that he wants more direct control of the side of the ball that has defined his career. As San Francisco’s defensive coordinator, Saleh built a reputation as a top defensive mind, and Tennessee clearly hopes to lean on that expertise to upgrade a defense that struggled with consistency last season.\n\nBut Saleh’s choice also raises the stakes on his offensive coordinator hire.\n\nWith Saleh focused on defense, Tennessee must land a top-tier offensive play-caller -- not only to manage game strategy but to help develop rookie quarterback Cam Ward, the 2025 No. 1 overall pick.\n\nWard showed promise as a rookie, but his continued growth likely hinges on having an OC who can design and call an effective offense. Saleh’s expanded role gives him control where he’s strongest, but success in Nashville will depend on pairing that with elite offensive leadership.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Robert Saleh plans to call defensive plays with Tennessee Titans",

Look at today, man. Crazy.\"\n\nHarbaugh plans to meet with members of Brian Daboll’s former staff this week to evaluate possible retentions, though significant changes are anticipated.\n\nThe Giants have also requested permission to interview Vikings passing game coordinator Daronte Jones for their defensive coordinator vacancy.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants' John Harbaugh addresses Todd Monken as possible OC",

    "fullText": "(This Jan 17 story has been repeated with no changes to text)\n\nNEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has asked a New ​York federal judge to deny a request by two lawmakers seeking an appointment ‌of a special master to monitor the public release of records tied to the late financier and ‌convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Justice Department since December has been releasing caches of documents tied to its investigations of Epstein. But U.S. Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie have criticized the department's slow pace.\n\nKhanna, a California Democrat, and Massie, a Kentucky Republican, last week ⁠said they asked U.S. District ‌Judge Paul Engelmayer to permit them to file a brief that would argue for the appointment of a special master and independent ‍monitor, given the Justice Department's failure to fully comply with a law that requires the DOJ to release all records related to Epstein by December 19.\n\nIn a six-page letter filed on Friday ​to U.S. District Court Judge Paul Engelmayer on Friday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi ‌and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche argued that Khanna and Thomas Massie are not parties to the U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell case involving Epstein and should not be allowed to file a friend of the court request in the matter.\n\n\"Representatives Khanna and Massie do not have standing, their stated objectives are in-consistent with the role of an amicus ⁠as well as the role of the Court, ​and, in any event, there is no authority ​permitting the Court to grant the Representatives the relief they improperly seek,\" the DOJ said in the letter signed by Jay Clayton, US attorney ‍for the Southern District ⁠of New York.\n\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.\n\nThe Justice Department said at the end of 2025 that it had ⁠5.2 million pages of Epstein files left to review and needs 400 lawyers from four different department ‌offices to help with the process through late January.",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets announced they have interviewed eight candidates to fill their defensive coordinator vacancy. Head coach Aaron Glenn will soon make a decision to appoint Steve Wilks' successor. Among the options, Detroit Lions assistant Jim O'Neil could emerge as the favorite.\n\nO'Neil has two advantages working in his favor. He's the only candidate on the list to possess previous experience with Coach Glenn. He's also just one of two candidates, alongside Wink Martindale, to have previously coordinated a defense in the NFL.\n\nLet's break them down into 2 categories:\n\nWorked previously with Aaron Glenn: Jim O'Neil (current Lions def asst/safeties coach)\n\nPrevious NFL DC experience: O'Neil (Cle, SF), Wink Martindale (Balt, NYG).

He also knows the Jets and AFC East well. O'Neil actually worked for the Jets from 2009-2012 under Rex Ryan, and later worked for the Buffalo Bills in 2013.\n\nO'Neil then coordinated the Cleveland Browns' defense in 2014-15, and then again for the San Francisco 49ers in 2016. The Browns fielded a top-10 scoring defense under O'Neil in 2014, but regressed to 29th in 2015. His 49ers defense in 2016 was the worst in the league, allowing 30 points per contest.\n\nThe Jets have a mixture of intriguing candidates. Ranging from veterans like O'Neil and Martindale to Jim Leonhard and DeMarcus Covington, Glenn has a decision to make. Glenn's familiarity with O'Neil could play a role.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Is Jim O'Neil emerging as Jets' defensive coordinator favorite?",

    "fullText": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is getting the message: He’s vulnerable to the same quick hit that President Trump ordered to pluck Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro from power and toss him into custody in New York.\n\nThe brazen Jan. 3 raid on Caracas by U.S. forces almost certainly struck more fear into the potbellied dictator than any military drills or aerial shows of force ever could. In doing so, it’s also ramped up the risks of a potential nuclear showdown as Kim goes into panic mode, triggered by the same American president who has routinely boasted of the pair’s “very good relationship.”\n\n“The operation to ‘rendition’ the president of Venezuela demonstrates the capabilities that have to be of concern to North Korea,” says Sydney Seiler, former national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council. The word “rendition,” as used by Seiler, is CIA-speak for capturing an enemy operative and sending him elsewhere for prosecution, or even torture and killing.\n\nThe other key word is “decapitation,” which Kim is well aware the Americans have been practicing in annual military exercises for years. “What’s appealing is that decapitation is the quickest way to terminate a conflict,” Seiler, who visited North Korea on negotiating teams before the North cut off all communications after the failure of Kim’s meetings with Trump in 2019, told the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n“Decapitation would be helpful in trying to deter North Korea,” Seiler believes. “Without Kim Jong Un,” he notes, North Korea would have no leader, no one who would know how to lead its outsized, underfed armed forces of 1.2 million troops, much less anyone in charge of its nuclear program.\n\nKim betrayed his deepest fears of a plot like the fracas in Caracas by authorizing release for North Korean audiences of a film all about the capture of Maduro. The film “Days and Nights of Confrontation,” could not have aired on North Korean state TV at a more propitious moment, days after elite U.S. troops seized Maduro and his wife. The message is clear: what’s to stop the Americans from repeating themselves in North Korea?\n\nThe film epitomizes “the trend of racy, Hollywood-style content aimed at appealing to young people,” says a South Korean website, NK News, that tracks North Korea. “Surely Mr. Kim and his family, including his fiery younger sister Yo-Jong, and his beloved teenage daughter, Ju-ae, would make great targets.” In one fell swoop the Americans could wipe out the dynasty that Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, founded when the Soviet Union installed him as leader of the northern half of the divided Korean peninsula after the Japanese surrender in 1945.\n\nCapturing Kim is not a new idea for American “rendition” experts.\n\n“Some White House aides believed his death would paralyze his country,” writes Joel Wit, who also joined negotiating teams to North Korea, inspecting the nuclear site at Yongbyon north of Pyongyang after North Korea signed an agreement in 1994 to stop producing nukes. “Go get Kim Jong Un, we were postured to do that,” says Wit in his tell-all book, Fallout: The Inside Story of America’s Failure to Disarm North Korea. One official is quoted as saying: “Everyone, including the North Koreans, knew killing him as part of the war plan.”\n\nMaybe the U.S. would have to marshal more than the 150 or so aircraft, and a few hundred troops, including the U.S. Army’s elite Delta Force, that were needed to grab Maduro, but Kim is well aware his family and entourage could be hustled aboard a helicopter bound for an American warship long before the Russians and Chinese could respond in support of North Korea’s military establishment, ill-fed, ill-trained and not at all ready to leap to their leader’s instant defense.\n\nIf capturing Kim sounds like mission impossible, consider his frequent appearances inspecting industrial and agricultural projects, reviewing troops, and presiding at ceremonies. He also shows up periodically at missile launches, perhaps the best time of all to catch him just as he’s making a show of pressing the button. The Americans, moreover, are steeped in the knowledge of what it will take to get him. U.S. forces have been training for years to go after him. Annual U.S.-South Korean exercises once routinely wound up with a mock “decapitation” of “the North Korean leader,” without explicitly naming Kim.\n\nThe U.S. command in Korea dropped the word “decapitation” from the war games in deference to their South Korean ally, who reminded them such language might not help in attempts at fruitless talks with the North Koreans, who now refuse to talk anyway. The word is gaining currency again with Maduro’s capture—while raising the question in Pyongyang of who might come next on the American hit list.\n\n“North Korea’s Kim expected to cling to [his] nuclear security blanket after Venezuela,” blared one headline in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. “The United States’ decapitation operation against Venezuela will reinforce North Korea’s nuclear ambitions,” read another. That warning should prompt Trump to act quickly to get rid of a nuisance who’s been plaguing the region for years with bombastic harangues, threatening his enemies with a nuclear holocaust while his own people suffer from hunger and disease.\n\nFlights of heavy American bombers do little or nothing to remove the threats posed by America’s foes. Kim knows he can laugh off another aerial show of intimidation or a useless meeting with Trump. The threat of a Maduro-style capture is far more effective. Kim’s worst fear is that the Americans, after rehearsing “decapitation” for years, will decide it’s time to finally put their plan into effect, stifling Asia’s leading terrorist just as suddenly as they whisked Maduro and his wife off to jail in New York.",

    "fullText": "If you have been hoping for a $2,000 tariff rebate check, it may not come.\n\nPresident Donald Trump gave mixed messages about the issues in a recent interview with The New York Times.\n\n\"You've promised $2,000 checks to Americans based off of your tariff revenues. When can they expect those?\" Times reporter Katie Rogers asked.\n\n\"I did do that? When did I do that?\" Trump said. \"Yeah, I'm thinking. Well, I did $1,776 for the military.\"\n\nWhen Tyler Pager, another Times journalist, followed up, asking when the checks would come, Trump replied that \"the tariff money is so substantial.\"\n\n\"That's coming in, that I'll be able to do $2,000 sometime,\" Trump said. \"I would say toward the end of the year.\"\n\nIn November, Trump posted on Truth Social proposing a $2,000 payout to all US citizens with low or middle incomes, because the government is \"taking in so much money\" from tariffs. According to a recent Supreme Court filing, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent estimated that the federal government may have collected around $1 trillion in tariffs.\n\n\"People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!\" Trump posted on Truth Social on November 9. \"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.\"\n\nEven if the Supreme Court doesn't rule his tariffs enacted under emergency powers unconstitutional in its coming decision, revenue generated by the duties may be spread too thin for a payout to Americans.\n\nLater in the interview with the Times, Trump said that the tariff revenue will go toward reducing federal government debt and funding national defense.\n\nAccording to the Treasury, the national debt as of January is around $38.40 trillion, and rose by $2.17 trillion in 2025. If Bessent's estimate on tariff revenue is correct, the total amount collected over the past year would cover less than 50% of the increase in debt.\n\nTrump also recently called for increasing the defense budget to $1.5 trillion for the fiscal year 2027. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the move would add $5.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.\n\nTrump has promised or suggested a number of payouts to Americans in his second term, including a $5,000 DOGE check, a $10,000 bonus for air traffic controllers with perfect attendance during the government shutdown, $1,000 to Trump Accounts for children who are citizens, and a $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" for active military members.\n\nAs for whether Trump even has the power to issue the checks, Congress, not the presidency, has the power of the purse and can make those appropriations.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.",
    "fullText": "If you’ve been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here’s what’s actually driving the nervousness: it’s not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.\n\nTake Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.\n\nDavid Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told The San Francisco Standard this week. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.\n\nBut that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.\n\nNow, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nBut the resistance is fierce and bipartisan. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They’ve called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and Peter Thiel’s firm leasing Miami office space last month. (Thiel has had ties to Miami for years — including a home — but an uncharacteristic press release about the move was seemingly meant to send a message.)\n\nEven Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting it. “This will be defeated, there’s no question in my mind,” he told the New York Times this week, adding that he’d been “relentlessly working behind the scenes” against the proposal. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nFor now, the union isn’t backing down. “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives,” said executive committee member Debru Carthan to the Journal last weekend. “The few who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.”\n\nThe proposal needs 875,000 signatures to make November’s ballot, where it would need a simple majority to pass.",

    "description": "The Alexander brothers' New York sex trafficking trial is scheduled to kick off with jury selection in a Manhattan federal court on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "Brothers Tal and Oren Alexander — once among the nation's top luxury real estate brokers — along with a third brother, are set to stand trial in Manhattan this week over allegations that the trio operated a long-running sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nJury selection in the federal criminal trial is scheduled to kick off Tuesday in the same 26th-floor courtroom where last year Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was cleared of the top sex trafficking and racketeering counts against him and convicted of lesser prostitution-related charges.\n\nThe case against the Alexander brothers marks the Department of Justice's latest high-profile sex-trafficking prosecution to reach trial since the Combs case. In the aftermath of the hip-hop mogul's trial, an attorney for Tal Alexander hailed the Combs verdict as both \"refreshing\" and \"heartening\" to Business Insider.\n\nTal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander, who was an executive at his family's private security firm, have vehemently denied the sex crimes charges against them, as well as all other allegations. They've been locked up at a notorious federal jail in Brooklyn since their December 2024 arrest in Miami.\n\nThe FBI began investigating the Alexander brothers after The Real Deal first reported in June of that year that two women had filed civil lawsuits against Oren and Alon Alexander, accusing them of rape. Those lawsuits sparked a wave of additional allegations against the brothers.\n\nAttorneys for the three brothers did not respond to requests for comment by Business Insider for this story.\n\n\"The brothers were young adults navigating social situations that may not have been perfect,\" a spokesperson for the Alexanders, Juda Engelmayer, told Business Insider, \"but that is not criminal conduct and bears no resemblance to trafficking.\"\n\nIf convicted at trial, the three brothers, who are 38 and 39, could face up to life behind bars.\n\nManhattan federal prosecutors, in court papers, have accused the Alexander brothers of working together and with others to drug, sexually assault, and rape dozens of women over more than a decade in posh locales like the Hamptons, Miami, and Manhattan.\n\nProsecutors have said in court filings that several attacks happened at Hamptons mansions, while another was aboard a Bahamian-flagged cruise ship.\n\nThe Alexander brothers face 12 felony counts, including conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, according to a superseding indictment filed last week. The indictment ties the charges to eight accusers, including two who were minors.\n\nThe superseding indictment also accuses Oren Alexander of recording himself and another person \"engaging in sexual activity with a incapacitated 17-year-old girl in Manhattan.\"\n\nThe government's case rests on allegations that the Alexanders used their wealth and prominent positions \"to create and facilitate opportunities to rape and sexually assault female victims\" in a scheme that ran from roughly 2008 to 2021.\n\nOren and Tal Alexander began their real estate careers at Douglas Elliman before launching their own brokerage, Official, in 2022.\n\nProsecutors said the Alexanders sometimes planned sexual assaults in advance, luring victims to locations with the \"promise of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations.\" Other times, the Alexander brothers chose their victims by chance, prosecutors allege.\n\nProsecutors said that ahead of the sex attacks, the brothers \"shared photographs of women and girls to select those they found sufficiently attractive to invite.\"\n\n\"The defendants and other men attending the trips pooled financial resources in order to pay for flights and other travel expenses for the women and girls,\" prosecutors have said in court papers.\n\nIt will ultimately be up to the jury to decide whether the brothers are guilty of the sex trafficking charges they face.\n\nDefense attorneys for the brothers have argued in court documents that the government overreached by bringing federal sex trafficking charges because the statute requires a \"commercial sex act\" that the indictment failed to allege.\n\n\"The Government alleges, as the 'thing of value,' that Defendants 'lured' their victims with 'promises of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations.' But that is not enough to establish a 'commercial sex act,'\" defense attorneys for Tal Alexander wrote in a June motion to dismiss, which the other brothers joined.\n\nThe lawyers wrote that the accusers did not provide sex \"on account of\" those promises \"as the statute requires.\" They added that the travel and accommodations \"did not represent compensation for the sex acts.\"\n\nThe defense lawyers argued that the government's effort to frame the brothers' alleged conduct as federal sex trafficking \"rests on a dangerously overbroad theory—one that would, if accepted, convert nearly any accusation of date rape into a federal sex trafficking offense.\"",

    "description": "Griffin Canning pitched for the New York Mets in 2025.",
    "fullText": "According to a new report from Jon Heyman of the New York Post, the St. Louis Cardinals are interested in rehabbing free agent starting pitcher Griffin Canning, who spent the 2025 campaign with the New York Mets.\n\nThe Mets have shown interest in bringing back Griffin Canning, who should be ready around Opening Day after suffering an Achilles tear last year. The Cardinals and White Sox also are interested.\n\nNow 29 years old, Canning is a six-year veteran of the Los Angeles Angels and Mets. He's gone 32-37 in his career with a 4.65 ERA. He had a career-high seven wins in 2023, and again in 2025 before getting hurt. He was 7-3 with a 3.77 ERA in 16 starts for the Mets. He hasn't traditionally struck out a lot of batters, but he had 70 Ks in 76.1 innings a season ago, signaling that perhaps he's unlocked more swing-and-miss stuff.\n\nThe Cardinals could be interested in a veteran innings-eater to help keep the pressure off young prospects like Quinn Matthews and Liam Doyle. Even though it's unclear exactly when he'd be able to return to a big-league rotation, he should be able to provide good cover for those prospects. The Cardinals may be able to trade him for a prospect at the trade deadline, or perhaps they could ink him to a multi-year deal, allowing him to rehab and work through things in 2026, while flipping him at some point in 2027.\n\nThe Cardinals are rebuilding, but they should be able to provide Canning with opportunities to rebuild his value. If he's looking for a promised rotation spot and an opportunity to impress people ahead of 2027, he could take a one-year deal in St. Louis. He could also end up being dealt to a contender at the deadline, giving him a chance to win a World Series.\n\nMatthew Liberatore, Dustin May and Andre Pallante are assured rotation spots, with Richard Fitts and Hunter Dobbins likely serving as options once they are recovered from their 2025 injuries. Beyond them, Doyle and Matthews are waiting.\n\nThe one that could impact Canning negatively? Perhaps there's too many variables, too many prospects and too many possibilities in the rotation as is. Maybe the rotation spot isn't guaranteed all year, which could scare him to an organization with more security.\n\nRemember to join our CARDINALS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

O'Neil, who also added the defensive assistant title with the Lions in 2025, has been with Detroit each of the past two seasons.\n\nO'Neil, 47, has worked in the Jets organization before, serving as the Jets' defensive quality control coach in 2009 when New York advanced to the first of what would be back-to-back AFC Championship games.\n\nThe Jets boasted the NFL's No. 1 passing defense (153.7 passing yards per game), total defense (252.3 yards per game), and scoring defense (14.8 points per game) during that 2009 campaign.\n\nWe've completed virtual interviews with the following candidates for our defensive coordinator opening.\n\n— New York Jets (@nyjets) January 16, 2026\n\nIn Detroit, O'Neil has overseen one of the league's best safety tandems.

Meanwhile, Brian Branch earned Pro Bowl honors in 2024 after notching 109 tackles, 16 passes defended, eight tackles for loss, four interceptions and one sack.\n\nThe Lions allowed the second-fewest passing touchdowns (18) and registered the lowest opposition passer rating (82.0) during the 2024 season.\n\nOf course, O'Neil worked under then-Lions defensive coordinator and now-Jets head coach Aaron Glenn during the 2024 season.\n\nFor more Lions coverage,  Follow Josh on X, @JoshOnLions\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lions Wire: Detroit Lions safeties coach interviews with New York Jets for DC job",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Manhattan's top federal prosecutor said Friday that a judge lacks the authority to appoint a neutral expert to oversee the public release of documents in the sex trafficking probe of financier Jeffrey Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nJudge Paul A. Engelmayer was told in a letter signed by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton that he must reject a request this week by the congressional cosponsors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act to appoint a neutral expert.\n\nU.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, say they have “urgent and grave concerns” about the slow release of only a small number of millions of documents that began last month.\n\nIn a filing to the judge they said they believed “criminal violations have taken place” in the release process.\n\nClayton, though, said Khanna and Massie do not have standing with the court that would allow them to seek the “extraordinary” relief of the appointment of a special master and independent monitor.\n\nEngelmayer “lacks the authority” to grant such a request, he said, particularly because the congressional representatives who made the request are not parties to the criminal case that led to Maxwell's December 2021 sex trafficking conviction and subsequent 20-year prison sentence for recruiting girls and women for Epstein to abuse and aiding the abuse.\n\nKhanna said Clayton's response “misconstrued” the intent of their request.\n\n“We are informing the Court of serious misconduct by the Department of Justice that requires a remedy, one we believe this Court has the authority to provide, and which victims themselves have requested,” Khanna said in a statement.\n\n“Our purpose is to ensure that DOJ complies with its representations to the Court and with its legal obligations under our law,” he added.\n\nEpstein died in a federal jail in New York City in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The death was ruled a suicide.\n\nThe Justice Department expects to update the court “again shortly” regarding its progress in turning over documents from the Epstein and Maxwell investigative files, Clayton said in the letter.\n\nThe Justice Department has said the files’ release was slowed by redactions required to protect the identities of abuse victims.\n\nIn their letter, Khanna and Massie wrote that the Department of Justice’s release of only 12,000 documents out of more than 2 million documents being reviewed was a “flagrant violation” of the law’s release requirements and had caused “ serious trauma to survivors.”\n\n“Put simply, the DOJ cannot be trusted with making mandatory disclosures under the Act,” the congressmen said as they asked for the appointment of an independent monitor to ensure all documents and electronically stored information are immediately made public.\n\nThey also recommended that a court-appointed monitor be given authority to prepare reports about the true nature and extent of the document production and whether improper redactions or conduct have taken place.",

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees are entering the final phase of Aaron Judge’s prime, but their front office isn’t acting like it this offseason.\n\nNew York’s ongoing talks with Cody Bellinger (who might land elsewhere) are happening within the context of a painfully underwhelming offseason for Yankees fans.\n\nFirst, the Yankees were blindsided by Trent Grisham accepting his qualifying offer. Their acquisitions and retentions since then have been marginal at best: Amed Rosario, Ryan Yarbrough, Paul Blackburn, and Ryan Weathers.\n\nWhile the Baltimore Orioles have been killing it this offseason, and with the Toronto Blue Jays making some big moves as well, the Yankees look ridiculous with how inactive they’ve been. The Boston Red Sox were more or less quiet for awhile, but even their offseason has been miles better than New York’s, especially now that they’ve added Ranger Suárez.\n\nBleacher Report’s Zachary D. Rymer recently wrote an article talking about the MLB teams who have had the worst offseason, and the Yankees were at the top of his list.\n\n“(The Yankees) seem to be treating their offseason shopping as an optional exercise,” Rymer wrote on Wednesday. “Even bringing back Cody Bellinger, which should be a lay-up, is proving difficult.\n\n… These are the Yankees we’re talking about. No move is supposed to be too big, so no fan should be forgiving of how they’ve made only small moves so far.”\n\n“The Yankees actually project as the fourth-best team in MLB this year, but those projections are taking a lot on faith with question marks like Anthony Volpe, Austin Wells and even Giancarlo Stanton,” Rymer continued. “In other words, the last thing the Yankees should be thinking is that they can leave good enough alone.”\n\nTwo AL East Teams Reportedly Still In On Framber Valdez",

    "fullText": "When the New York Mets signed Bo Bichette on Friday to a three-year, $126 million deal, many MLB fans (particularly those rooting for the New York Yankees) assumed that the Mets halt their pursuit of Cody Bellinger.\n\nThat’s not what’s happening, according to New York Mets On SI’s Pat Ragazzo.\n\n“The Mets are still in play for free agent first baseman/outfielder Cody Bellinger, as sources told Mets On SI on Friday,” Ragazzo wrote.\n\n“The versatile Bellinger fits the Mets at multiple positions given his above average defense at first base and in center and left field. Bellinger’s left-handed bat would also provide added protection in the Mets’ lineup for Francisco Lindor, Juan Soto and Bichette. Bellinger also has a .929 career OPS at Citi Field in 20 games.”\n\n“The Mets could plug Bellinger in center or left field, or at first base if they aren’t comfortable playing Jorge Polanco and Brett Baty at the position,” Ragazzo added.\n\nBellinger has carved out a dynamic nine-year MLB career marked by peaks and valleys. Debuting with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2017, he earned Rookie of the Year honors with 39 home runs. His 2019 MVP season saw him smash 47 homers while batting .305, followed by a 2020 World Series title. Injuries hampered him in 2021-22, leading to a non-tender and a rebound with the Chicago Cubs in 2023 (.307 average, 26 homers). In 2024, he hit .266 with 18 long balls before opting out of his deal.\n\nBellinger’s 2025 campaign with the Yankees represented a strong resurgence, batting .272 with 29 home runs, 98 RBIs, and 13 stolen bases in 152 games. He posted an .813 OPS, 125 wRC+, and delivered memorable moments like a three-homer game against the Cubs, aiding the Yankees’ playoff push.\n\nBellinger remains a free agent, with ongoing talks stalled over contract length (he seeks seven years, while New York offers five at $155-160 million).\n\nBo Bichette Signing Creates Perfect Trade Fit For Red Sox",

Wilks was fired after 14 games and Harris, the Jets' defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator, took over the play calling.\n\n“Compatibility is just as important as coachability,” Glenn said last week when asked about what he's looking for in a defensive coordinator. “So, I want to make sure we see things the same way and I want to make sure that we can vibe as far as sitting down and talking about how we see football.”\n\nLeonhard, a former safety who played for the Jets from 2009-11, has some familiarity with Glenn. In Leonhard's final season as a player in 2014 for Cleveland, Glenn served as the Browns' assistant defensive backs coach.\n\nLeonhard began his coaching career as an assistant at Wisconsin, his alma mater, in 2016 before becoming the Badgers' defensive coordinator and later the interim head coach in 2022. After one year at Illinois, Leonhard joined Sean Payton's staff in Denver as the defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator in 2024 before adding assistant head coach to his duties this season.\n\nMartindale was the defensive coordinator at Michigan the last two seasons after a two-year stint in the same role with the Giants. After several college stops to begin his coaching career, Martindale had NFL stints with the Raiders, Broncos and Ravens.\n\nAraujo spent the last four seasons with the Dolphins, first as an assistant defensive backs coach for Mike McDaniel and then as the cornerbacks coach.\n\nBanda coached the Browns’ safeties the last three seasons under Kevin Stefanski after several college stops, including Texas, Mississippi State, Miami and Utah State.\n\nCovington joined the Packers this season as their defensive line coach and run game coordinator after spending eight seasons with the Patriots, including last season as the defensive coordinator.\n\nJones has spent the last five seasons with the Vikings as the defensive backs coach and also served as the pass game coordinator the last three. He has also had NFL coaching stints with the Dolphins and Bengals.\n\nO’Neil has been with the Lions the past two years, including the 2024 season when Glenn was the defensive coordinator in Detroit. He's a defensive assistant who also coaches the Lions' safeties. He was a defensive quality control coach for the Jets in 2009 and their assistant defensive backs coach from 2010-12. O'Neil also has spent time with the Bills, Browns, 49ers and Raiders.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "The team behind Baby Steps discuss why they made a whiny, unprepared manbaby the protagonist – and how players have grown to love Nate as he struggles up a mountain\n\n“I don’t know why he is in a onesie and has a big ass,” shrugs game developer Gabe Cuzzillo. “Bennett just came in with that at some point.”\n\n“I thought it would be cute,” replies Bennett Foddy, who was formerly Cuzzillo’s professor at New York University’s Game Center and is now his collaborator. “Working on character design and animation brings you over to liking big butts. I could give you an enormous amount of evidence for this.”\n\nFoddy and Cuzzillo are talking about Nate, the impressively pathetic manbaby protagonist of their profound and ridiculous comedy game Baby Steps, developed together with Maxi Boch. When I was preparing to talk to them, I felt like I was about to meet my tormentors: I spent a week last year in the grip of this purposefully, transcendentally frustrating game about going on a horrible hiking holiday with the world’s most incompetent loser.\n\nBaby Steps’ premise seems like a cruel joke at first: watch the hapless man suffer! And you will suffer too! But the more I played it, the more meaning I found in it. As the hours passed and I helped Nate overcome his own uselessness and get himself up the mountain, I came around to him.\n\n“People coming around to him is common,” Foddy says. “We’ve had a lot of people say they hated him at the outset – and then they started either identifying with him or identifying him with other people in their lives. Some people end up sexualising him. The commonality between all these things is people coming around in some way, and that is the core philosophy of the game. It should be that it starts out feeling arduous and awkward and annoying and hostile, and then we try to bring you around to find pleasure in it … that happens to Nate in the story as well. He would never go outside for a hike.”\n\nNate is a large, bearded, russet-haired 35-year-old guy with glasses who lives in his parents’ basement. He is socially awkward, a shy urinator, whiny and massively averse to accepting help from anyone. Early in the game you come across another hiker who offers you a map of the mountain; a little mini-map pops up in the corner of the screen for a few seconds before Nate refuses it and it disappears. I guffawed at this. Like most of Baby Steps, it’s a joke about the comfortable, streamlined gaming experiences that we’ve become used to. But it’s also a joke about Nate, and the kind of guy he is.\n\nTalking to Cuzzillo threw me off at first because he is also the voice of Nate; he and Foddy improvised every line in the game. But he also has a deeper connection to the character. “Nate is one manifestation of my personality,” he says. “He’s an aspect of who I am. He’s not a made-up guy. I totally have refuse-the-map guy within me. That’s deep in who I am. If someone tries to help me, I run away screaming. Sometimes that’s a joyful part of who I am, and sometimes it isn’t.”\n\n“In video games you do this too – you immediately put it on the hardest setting and turn off the assists,” attests Foddy.\n\nLike (almost) all game characters, Nate was once a stickman with a block for a head and tissue boxes for feet. Foddy and Cuzzillo ran through nine or 10 prototypes before alighting on the concept for Baby Steps, prototypes that Cuzzillo describes as “very bad”. “We were looking for something with legs,” adds Foddy, straight-faced.\n\nFoddy’s games are full of ostensibly pointless suffering. It’s a theme of his work, alongside the idea of awkwardly moving a character’s body: a previous game of his, Getting Over It, has you trying to fling a guy in a cauldron up a hill with a sledgehammer. This prototype, in which you’d individually control a character’s feet to walk them around, fit that bill: within a couple of days the blockman had become a helicopter pilot, an off-the-shop placeholder asset. It was a couple more years before he became Nate, and six more before the game was finished.\n\n“The idea is that he’s not prepared and he’s out of shape,” says Cuzzillo. “Having an unprepared character gives the player an excuse if they’re feeling like they’re insufficient. They can blame him,” Foddy elaborates. “We had the idea of a cute lumberjacky guy with a little backpack, based on one of our friends, who will never need to know that he was the inspiration.”\n\nAnother of Foddy and Cuzzillo’s friends and colleagues was the source of Baby Steps’ name. They both now teach at NYU’s Game Center, whose chair emeritus Frank Lantz burst into their office with an idea for the name; at that point the main character was a giant baby (you could argue that he still is). Plenty of infantilising imagery remains, from rivers of breast milk to massive sandcastle toys to the gigantic woman who picks Nate up and cradles him in one especially surreal scene.\n\nAs they were playtesting the game with their friends, another aspect of Nate’s personality began to emerge: his misplaced pride. “This slightly obstinate vein of toxic masculine play starts coming out, from seeing some of our friends play it in a certain kind of way,” Foddy says. One of those friends, Julian Cordero (maker of Despelote), started looking very intently off the edge of cliffs after climbing them, inspiring a scene in which Nate’s fellow hiker Mike sits on the edge of a platform contemplating throwing himself all the way down again.\n\nBaby Steps’ interesting exploration of what masculinity means to a guy like Nate is delivered both through the story and the experience of play. You can unlock short, abstract, playable flashbacks to his childhood and the humiliating experiences that have shaped him. There are also somewhat less subtle symbols around, such as the omnipresent phallic imagery. An interesting thing about this game’s meditations on masculinity is that it doesn’t involve women at all: at a time when men’s insecurities are continually being lumped on women and feminism by common-or-garden internet misogynists, this is refreshing. As Foddy says: “Men can have problems with masculinity just by themselves.”\n\nThere is one thing that Nate straightforwardly loves: fruit. Pieces of shiny fruit hang tantalisingly in almost-inaccessible places, tempting you to waste a chunk of your life trying to reach them. If you do, you are treated to a ludicrous close-up of Nate’s face as he noisily consumes it before screaming its name into the wind.\n\n“We needed something to put on top of stuff,” explains Cuzzillo, deadpan. And a selection of increasingly esoteric fruits was the obvious choice? He explains that rewarding the player would be antithetical to the game’s philosophy. “[So] what if it’s a reward for Nate? What if it’s something he loves, so you get to vicariously watch him get a reward? The day we came up with it, we recorded the first five vocal takes … It’s funniest when you’ve tried hardest for it, and what’s at the top is just him having this crazy fruit orgasm.”\n\nThe inspiration for the dumb camera angle – the wide-angle lens from the top of the forehead – was trainspotter Francis Bourgeois. “Something we both got into during Covid, when we were doing initial exploration on this game, is the vein of culture that emerges when people are critically bored,” explains Foddy. “The idea is that these fruit cutscenes are coming when the player is feeling as unhinged as Nate is when he’s enjoying the fruit.”\n\nThat is the joke that Baby Steps keeps coming back to: you might hate Nate, but also if you’re playing a game like this, then in some way you are Nate. After many, many hours on the mountain, out in the snow, you reach an ending when Nate finds a cabin owned by a donkey-man whom he’s sort of befriended on his journey. After a few false starts, he finally knocks on the door and asks to be let in from the cold. You can go for a walk after that concluding scene, but the game goes to great lengths to warn you that there’s no point. There’s nothing else out there.\n\nBaby Steps’ final joke is that it’s lying to you: there is a final cutscene at the top of the mountain. You can go find it if you want, if you’re just irredeemably that kind of person. But for me, the game’s true ending is Nate finally learning to ask for help. I was rather moved by it.\n\nAfter Cuzzillo finished his first commercial game, 2019’s Ape Out, he felt ambivalent about it. “I wasn’t sure whether it was worth it; whether, once I was at the top of the mountain, I really wished I had climbed it,” he says. But he’s feeling much better about Baby Steps in retrospect, and about Nate.\n\n“I understand it way more now after finishing it. I feel like I’m re-realising all the things the game is about… Nate is a microcosm of the whole game, where it’s both a piss-take and sincere at the same time. It’s not one or the other.”",

    "title": "After losing out on Kyle Tucker, Mets left trying to figure out how to save offseason of own doing",
    "description": "The Mets swung for Kyle Tucker, but the outfielder ultimately took the Dodgers' $240 million offer, and New York is now trying to figure out how to salvage their offseason.",
    "fullText": "Only a couple of hours after Steve Cohen tweeted that he was looking for signs of smoke, a Vatican-style reference to the Mets waiting for an answer from Kyle Tucker, the Los Angeles Dodgers stunned him and the entire baseball world by signing the slugger to a deal worth $60 million a year on Thursday night.\n\nSo it’s almost too easy yet…the question begs to be asked: does Cohen want this smoke?\n\nOr will he, like most other MLB teams now, hold his cards close to the vest and wait for the inevitable lockout and war over a salary cap that is coming after the 2026 season?\n\nIn short, the Mets probably thought they were raising the bar into rarefied air by offering Tucker, a very good hitter but hardly a superstar, $220 million over four years. And in some ways, they were. Only for the Dodgers to swat them aside almost dismissively.\n\nSuffice to say, Cohen did no further tweeting on Thursday night.\n\nAnd I’m not blaming him or the Mets for drawing a line at $55 million a year (their final offer) for Tucker, as absurd as that sounds.\n\nYet, getting outbid must still be embarrassing in a way to Cohen. He’s a man who’s accustomed to getting what he wants, after all, even if it means spending obscene amounts of money for art pieces to add to his renowned collection.\n\nAs the richest billionaire owner in baseball, Cohen was supposed to be the death of baseball, remember?\n\nYes, the irony here is that this is what most other owners in the sport feared when Cohen said at his very first press conference as owner of the Mets that he wanted to model his organization after the Dodgers, that he might use his billions to create a new Evil Empire in Queens.\n\nRemember, at the time, the Dodgers were indeed a model organization that consistently drafted and developed home-grown talent in a way that allowed them to challenge for a championship every year without blowing the roof off the payroll.\n\nNow it’s different, of course. Helped in large part by the Shohei Ohtani connection that has attracted other Japanese stars and his willingness to defer hundreds of millions of dollars on his $700-million contract, the Dodgers are now outspending the rest of baseball in a manner that may have made even the famously impulsive George Steinbrenner look like a piker were he still alive today.\n\nEvil Empire? More like King Kong at this point.\n\nStill, Cohen has the money if he wants to compete with the big, bad Dodgers. And none of this is to excuse the Mets for what has been an underwhelming offseason.\n\nAs it is, it’s hard to tell if their sudden all-out pursuit of Tucker was part of their plan all along or more of a realization they desperately needed a big-splash move as Mets fans showed their displeasure with their wallets.\n\nDid they suddenly decide they better find someone to hit behind Juan Soto so he wouldn’t walk 150 times next season?\n\nWouldn’t it just have been easier to give Pete Alonso the $150 million over five years? He had made it clear he was willing to ease into the DH role, so I’ll never understand why the Mets drew such a hard line there.\n\nThey were willing to go three years but not five? It just never made sense, considering their need for a right-handed power hitter. And whatever their intentions at that time were regarding Tucker, they left themselves vulnerable one way or another.\n\nAnd now, even if they change course and throw crazy money at Cody Bellinger, well, sure, he’d make them better in a lot of ways, but he wouldn’t fill the huge hole in the lineup behind Soto.\n\nSo it’s hard to see how they’re going to have anything resembling a championship-caliber offense, whether they go after Bellinger or not.\n\nAnd if they were truly going all-in on run prevention, the David Stearns buzzword from the moment the 2025 season ended, why haven’t they made the expected moves to upgrade their pitching?\n\nDominant starting pitching and a lockdown bullpen would always offer hope of beating anyone, even the Dodgers, in a short series in October, yet the Mets haven’t gone that route either.\n\nAll along, I’ve said it wasn’t fair to judge Stearns until the offseason was over. And who knows, maybe now he’ll go out and trade for Freddy Peralta and sign Framber Valdez, and suddenly the Mets will have a starting rotation that can indeed beat anybody, especially if Nolan McLean blossoms into the ace everyone is now expecting.\n\nBut lest we forget, Edwin Diaz is now a Dodger, too. And while I’m laying some of that on Diaz for seemingly wanting to take the easy route to winning a championship ring, the Mets put themselves in a position to let it happen by not locking up their closer before LA ever got involved.\n\nIn truth, the most logical move at this point for Cohen might just be to hold onto his chips, save his money for Tarik Skubal next winter, or whenever the sport is open for business again, while seeing what McLean, Jonah Tong, Brandon Sproat, Carson Benge, Jett Williams and other top prospects look like by mid-summer as the trading deadline approaches.\n\nI’m not saying the Dodgers are unbeatable. The Blue Jays were one hanging slider away from beating them in the World Series.\n\nBut it’s hard to see how the Mets, without dramatic pitching upgrades at the very minimum, can realistically compete with LA for a championship in 2026.\n\nAnd right now that’s on Stearns. You can blame the Dodgers all you want for blowing up the sport and setting up a salary cap fight not only between owners and players, but owners and owners as well.\n\nYet the Mets shouldn’t be sitting here in mid-January trying to figure out how to save their offseason. If Stearns’ plan was to let the market come to him in search of the best value, which seems to be his M.O., well, it sure looks to be backfiring to the point where desperation is now part of the equation.\n\nDesperation and the LA Dodgers, that is.",

Harbaugh immediately became the most sought after coach on the market and the Giants’ top target. The team wasted no time in establishing contact with Harbaugh’s camp, and Chris Mara even visited the Super Bowl winning coach at his Baltimore home.\n\nGeneral manager Joe Schoen led a speedy and efficient coaching search that positioned them to be the first team able to hire a coach.\n\nIt had previously been reported that Harbaugh left East Rutherford without a deal, and would take a meeting with the Tennessee Titans at home on Baltimore.\n\nInstead, it seems as though Harbaugh will eventually be announced as the Giants head coach in 2026. This is clearly welcome news to any fan who feared the team fumbled the opportunity to get the most experienced coach in a chaotic market.\n\nGiants have been starved for victories (literal and figurative) for far too long. John Harbaugh was the consensus No. 1 coaching domino, and—barring a setback—he will coach the Giants in 2026. That represents a much-needed victory for a franchise desperately seeking leadership to guide its young nucleus of talent.\n\nThe concentration now shifts to the two sides hammering out the details of an agreement, and then filling out the coaching staff to maximize the Giants’ defensive play as well as Jaxson Dart’s development.\n\nWe’ll bring you more news and updates as we get them.",

    "description": "The New York Giants EDGE room is talented, but how do they look moving into 2026?",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants had little to cheer about throughout 2025, but the edge positiohn provided a spark to the dank swamp that was the Giants’ season. Veteran pass rusher Brian Burns finished second in the NFL with 16.5 sacks, only behind the Browns’ Myles Garrett, who broke Michael Strahan’s single-season sack record with 23. Rookie, third-overall-pick, Abdul Carter finished the season strong, after showing resiliency and overcoming his own immaturity issues.\n\nNew York finished with 39 sacks in 2025, which ranked 17th in the NFL. They had 45 in 2024 (9th in NFL) and 34 in 2023 (29th in NFL). Overall, the edge room was the Giants’ strength, but they were not perfect either. Let’s review the 2025 season.\n\nBrian Burns, Abdul Carter, Kayvon Thibodeaux, Chauncey Golston, Tomon Fox, Victor Dimukeje\n\nThe Giants had three quality edge defenders in 2025: Brian Burns, Abdul Carter, and Kayvon Thibodeaux; those three accounted for 2,201 of the total 2,465 defensive snaps. Burns led the team with 863 snaps, and Carter had 844. Kayvon Thibodeaux sustained a shoulder injury in Week 10 against the Chicago Bears and eventually landed on the Injured Reserve; he played 494 snaps and finished with 32 pressures.\n\nThibodeaux’s presence and development were felt early in the season. He only had 2.5 sacks, but had a tackle for a loss in five of his first six games. Thibodeaux added 19 STOPs at the line of scrimmage, and he was robbed of a strip of Jalen Hurts on the infamous Tush Push play. His improvement as an overall football player was evident throughout the season, but it wasn’t consistent.\n\nFinishing plays was still an issue for Thibodeaux, as he missed nine tackles in 2025 (29%). Now, to be fair, some of these missed tackles are high-effort plays from the backside that alter the running back’s path, but the point remains — need more well-rounded consistency from the 25-year-old EDGE rusher.\n\nThibodeaux missed time in 2024 as well. He finished with 324 pass-rushing snaps in 2025 and just 358 in 2024, finishing with 32 and 38 pressures, respectively. Thibodeaux has improved as a player, and he’s a good football player, but he hasn’t displayed the top-five pedigree that many Giants’ fans thought they were receiving when Joe Schoen selected him as such in 2022. Still, he’s an asset and one the Giants must make a decision about now that he enters next season on his fifth-year option.\n\nBrian Burns is the heart and soul of the Giants’ roster. No player sets an example for others to emulate like Burns. He is a constant hustler who plays through nagging injuries, while being a necessary vocal leader that this defense desperately needs.\n\nBurns had a career year with 16.5 sacks to go along with his 53 pressures; he now has 114 pressures in two seasons with the Giants. Burns was also an asset as a run defender, accounting for 42 STOPs, which is tied for a career high for Burns (2024). Burns is everything a coach would want in a leader on the football team, and he sets an excellent example for Abdul Carter.\n\nAbdul Carter has recorded 66 pressures, the 8th-most in the NFL (most among rookies this season).\n\nA league-high 44 quick pressures (under 2.5 seconds time to pressure) and averaging a 2.41-second time to pressure, the quickest in the NFL among defenders with at least 200 pass…\n\n— Nick Falato (@nickfalato) January 5, 2026\n\nFew players in the NFL were as successful as ACarter at winning in a phone booth. Carter’s quickness and fluidity are rare even at the NFL level, which is why he led the league with 44 quick pressures. Offensive linemen who failed to time their punch or failed to make clean contact on Carter struggled to account for his speed and elusiveness as a pass-rusher.\n\nDoubts surrounding Carter grew louder when Mike Kafka held him accountable TWICE for missing team meetings. It seemed apparent that Brian Daboll was soft with Carter, and Kafka made an example of him against Green Bay by benching him for a series. Two weeks later, Kafka benched Carter for the entire quarter of a prime-time game against New England.\n\nTo Carter’s credit, he took the message to heart and finished the season strong, recording 22 pressures over the final four games, with interim defensive coordinator Charlie Bullen praising his approach to practice. Carter appeared to need a kick in the rear — a reality check — to push him toward his potential. The hope now is that the lesson sparked lasting maturity and sustained motivation, rather than a brief moment of realization, spawned by internet trolling and the overall embarrassment of being held accountable.\n\nEven with Carter’s issues, he still showed enough for me to be excited about his development. He must get better against the run. The strength is necessary for him to unlock a well-rounded approach to the game. He was also frequently out of position early in the season, but that seemed to be rectified down the stretch of the year. It was not a perfect rookie season, but his talents are undeniable — let’s see how he approaches the off-season.\n\nGolston only played 173 snaps due to foot and neck injuries that he dealt with at different parts of the season. The high point of Golston’s season was against Minnesota, where he had five STOPs at the line of scrimmage and was an asset against the run. We have not seen the best of Golston; he finished with five pressures and a sack. Dimukeje and Fox hardly saw the field; the former had one pressure and the latter two.\n\nThe Giants remain strong at EDGE going into next season, although questions about Kayvon Thibodeaux’s future with the team will likely be entertained throughout the off-season. Thibodeaux is entering his fifth-year option season and is a possible trade or extension candidate. Trading Thibodeaux would free up $14.8 million on the cap with no dead cap incurred.\n\nPersonally, I would love to extend Thibodeaux, and the Giants may get him at a slight discount, since he’s finished the last two seasons on the I.R. However, Thibodeaux may want to wait and see his options after next season, which puts the Giants in a position to explore the market, depending on their long-term interest in the 25-year-old.\n\nWith no off-season trades, a trio of Burns, Carter, and Thibodeaux is a lethal edge room for any defensive coordinator. Bullen was able to generate success and deceptive looks from the front with Burns and Carter at the end of the season, and Shane Bowen even helped Burns achieve a career-type of year. The defensive structure will be important, but the ingredients (the personnel) are an excellent baseline — let’s hope they find someone who can cook.\n\nI will say, though, the Giants could still use another edge defender, whether it’s a veteran signing or a day three pick. More depth at the position now that Dimukeje — who missed most of the season with injuries — and Fox are not under contract. Like many positions on the roster, the depth could be replenished, but the top-end of the edge room remains the most impressive on the roster.",

For our previous tracker, you can catch up here:\n\nNEW PODCAST EPISODE: Our Giants 'All In with Art Stapleton' show explores John Harbaugh candidacy, Ravens drama\n\nJohn Harbaugh is in the building.\n\nNow it’s up to the New York Giants to convince him to stay.\n\nHarbaugh is visiting the Giants on Wednesday, a source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to NorthJersey.com and The Record.\n\nThe Giants are throwing everything they can into the pursuit of Harbaugh to make him their next head coach. They'll deal with the fallout if there is any with the rest of their candidate list if he says no.\n\nThe Giants are clearly executing a multifaceted plan to convince Harbaugh to be the next NYG coach. There was a promise of more interactions to come, and the biggest is taking place Wednesday.\n\nNow the question is whether the Giants sell Harbaugh enough to close the deal before he leaves, potentially for a reported two more in-person visits he is expected to take with the Tennessee Titans and the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nRumors are swirling on social media regarding John Harbaugh's schedule. Here's what we know: the expectation is that the 63-year-old free agent coach will meet with the Giants and other potential suitors - reportedly the Falcons and the Titans - by the end of the week.\n\nDoes that mean Friday? Does that mean Sunday? It's not exactly clear.\n\nAnd while the anticipation is that Harbaugh would travel to those cities, it's still yet to be confirmed that he will be boots-on-the-ground inside 1925 Giants Drive - or anywhere else - on this interview circuit. The contingents could still travel and meet with the former Ravens coach.\n\nWe'll stay on top of all the news and nuggets throughout the day, so stick around.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: NY Giants coaching search tracker with news and candidate updates",

    "title": "I'm 7 months postgrad and still job hunting. I'm leaning on my hobbies to help overcome imposter syndrome.",
    "description": "I graduated from college and moved to New York City to apply for full-time jobs. I haven't found one yet, but I've learned to prioritize my hobbies.",
    "fullText": "Before graduating from Syracuse University last spring with a degree in journalism, it seemed like everyone (including me) was scrambling to make plans, get jobs, and figure out where to move.\n\nI always expected life after college would fall seamlessly into place, that all of my involvement in campus media, internships, and good grades would pay off immediately.\n\nSo, when I learned that my childhood friend was planning to move to New York City, it was the perfect opportunity to take the leap together. I'd always dreamed of moving there, and as the home of many big-name publications, it seemed like the right city to be in to kick-start my career.\n\nCome June, I'd moved, gotten a job at a coffee shop, and continued applying to every dream job under the sun (just like the hundreds of other LinkedIn applicants).\n\nLittle did I know, the barista position I'd only planned to have for a month or two would still be my lifeline seven months later.\n\nAt the beginning of my job search, I was incredibly motivated, but slowly, the rejections began to roll in.\n\nI started feeling like maybe I was the problem, that my experiences and skills weren't good enough. How was I supposed to gain more experience if no one would hire me?\n\nImposter syndrome hit me hard, especially since it seemed like the first question anyone wanted to ask me was, \"What do you do?\"\n\nAt first, I'd provide a whole spiel: I just graduated and am working as a barista while I look for a job in journalism, and interviews are going well. I always felt the need to make it appear as though I was on the brink of getting \"the job.\"\n\nThe catalyst for shifting my mindset came later, over dinner with a friend at our favorite Indian restaurant. We talked about life, relationships, New York work culture, and overall, what it means to unplug from the outside world for a second.\n\nMy friend shared his thoughts on being part of corporate America and said he doesn't base his worth on the job he has or his level of success. His words made me think about my own self-worth and why I'd been placing it all on my career and how qualified I am compared to others.\n\nNow, when I'm faced with the \"what do you do\" question, I say I'm a barista and freelancer looking for full-time work in journalism.\n\nI'm less concerned with explaining why I'm not working in corporate yet and more concerned with maintaining my peace and joy, as well as exploring my other interests.\n\nAlthough people's responses to my answers haven't changed much, my confidence in where I'm at and where I'm going has.\n\nAlthough this isn't the life I envisioned having after graduation, I'm grateful for the time I've had to explore my hobbies and be an active member of my community.\n\nAs an avid yogi and certified yoga teacher, I've enjoyed taking free yoga classes in Bryant Park. It's been a great way to get moving, plus it's given me a reason to stop with the endless job applications and catch up with some friends.\n\nIn my free time after barista shifts, I even parlayed my love of yoga into a three-month stint as a front desk receptionist at a studio in SoHo. In exchange for three hours of dedication a week, I got to take unlimited classes from some of the best yoga teachers I've ever had.\n\nAside from yoga, I also signed up with my roommate to volunteer within my Muslim community and teach religious education classes to kids.\n\nGrowing up, I loved attending these classes; it connected me to my culture and was also how my roommate and I met as kids. So, participating in this has felt like a full-circle moment that I likely wouldn't have had if I were already working full-time.\n\nHowever, despite finding a great community, I've found my feelings of imposter syndrome are still present — fueled by the overwhelming chaos and fast-paced energy of the city.\n\nOver the last few months, I've learned NYC isn't the best place for me — at least not right now.\n\nI always come home feeling like I haven't done enough, and it exhausts me. This is partially a result of my mindset, but I also think it's a direct consequence of living in a place known for its hustle.\n\nAlthough living here has been a great experience and played a huge role in helping me gain confidence, I'm ready for somewhere that's slower-paced.\n\nThere are, of course, still days when I struggle with my own self-talk and understanding my purpose, but I'm confident a move is the best next step for me as I continue working toward my goals and exploring all of the other things that make me who I am.\n\nMy time in the industry will come, and until then, I'll keep side-questing and doing everything I can to remain happy and present.",

    "title": "People are pretty upset about a meme coin promoted by former mayor Eric Adams that quickly crashed",
    "description": "A NYC themed meme coin crashed shortly after launch this week, drawing swift outcry from the crypto community online.",
    "fullText": "Former New York City Mayor Eric Adams was a bullish proponent of crypto during his time in office, but an ill-fated meme coin debut this week has drawn outcry.\n\nOn January 12, Adams shared a post on his X account announcing the launch of NYC Token, a New York-themed token with no official ties to the city, but which creators said on the token's website would go toward \"critical initiatives.\" Adams said some proceeds would go toward fighting antisemitism and blockchain education for kids.\n\nAs it started trading, the coin quickly surged to a market cap of roughly $580 million before suddenly reversing course and plunging more than 80% in a few minutes.\n\nOutrage from the crypto community has been swift this week.\n\nThe episode drew accusations that investors had been victims of a \"rug pull,\" in which a token's major holders sell after an initial surge, leaving investors locked into their positions and unable to exit without losing money.\n\nWhile NYC Token rose slightly on its second day of trading, accusations that either Adams or the token's creators had \"rugged\" investors continued to swirl. Legal filings show that the company behind NYC Token, c18 digital LLC, was formed in Delaware two weeks ago.\n\nAn anonymous crypto influencer on X shared several posts saying liquidity had been pulled before NYC Token's plunge, with screenshots to illustrate, and users posted that they believed Adams had profited from the scheme.\n\n\"This has to be the fastest rug pull I've ever seen,\" said one user on X\n\nFor others, the sense of schadenfreude was strong as they watched meme coin investors caught in another high-profile collapse. The episode drew comparisons to Hawk Tuah coin, promoted by viral influencer Haliey Welch. The coin surged before losing 95% of its value shortly after its debut.\n\nA rug pull is usually defined as making a token effectively useless, which in memecoin land often means removing the liquidity needed for holders to sell,\" Haonan Li, founder of stablecoin merchant platform Codex, told Business Insider. That's what appears to have happened in Adam's case—the base layer of liquidity was pulled from the market.\"\n\nAdams could not be reached for comment. Representatives for the token's creators did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nCrypto data platform CoinGecko was still flagging the NYC Token as high risk on Wednesday. It posted the following disclaimer on the token's page:\n\n\"According to Rugcheck.xyz, there is a risk of market manipulation due to large concentration of tokens held in one or more unidentified wallets. Please use caution.\"",

    "fullText": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says he expects Republican President Donald Trump to try to interfere with the midterm elections, and he says raids by immigration agents in major cities are creating a sense of chaos that voters will reject in November.\n\nThe comments were part of a wide-ranging, 20-minute Associated Press telephone interview with the New York Democrat, who argued former Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola's entry into the Senate race gives his party a path to the majority.\n\nSchumer said that economic concerns have begun to cement in the minds of voters and that Democrats have plans to build their campaign around the costs, chaos and corruption they attribute to the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House has called such Democratic statements “fearmongering” to score political points.\n\nThis is an edited transcript of the interview.\n\nQ: Some are predicting Trump will try to prevent an open and fair midterm election and would be expected to dispute the results. Do you share those concerns?\n\nA: We share them, and we already have teams of both senators and lawyers looking at every way that Trump could try to screw things up, and we’re fighting against it. We already have a team to make sure that they count the votes fairly. And, remember, still, a lot of the election mechanisms are done by the states. And even in red states, there’s resistance to Trump interfering.\n\nTrump will do whatever it takes, and he has no honor and no credibility and no respect for law. But, we are prepared for it, and we believe we will succeed.\n\nInfluence of ICE raids on election\n\nQ: What impact do you think the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids are having on the midterms early on?\n\nA: People don’t like chaos. They see that cities and mayors who were perfectly calm and safe are now undergoing all of this chaos. And, you know, as I said, cost is number one. But it’s costs, corruption and chaos. The people don’t like it. And Trump, at the same time he's saying he wants to protect the protesters in Iran, he is going after protesters and other innocent civilians in Minneapolis. Makes no sense to people.\n\nQ: Does it seem to you like economic factors that are dissatisfying to a lot of the voting public are durable in this election year?\n\nA: Absolutely. The number one thing that bothers American families is they can't pay all the bills.\n\nThe costs is the number one issue. The cost of living, affordability, call it what you will. But it’s the number one issue, and now they realize that Trump is screwing them up on all of this.\n\nOn health care, with not extending the ACA tax credits, on energy, by getting rid of clean energy, wind and solar, raising their electric bills with tariffs, which is making the price of everything go up. So, people now realize that Trump is hurting them.\n\nWe are going to focus on five issues in terms of lowering people’s costs. They are health care, housing, tariffs — you know, costs of goods — food prices, because of food monopolies, and child care.\n\nTrump and the Republicans are in a bubble, and they don't understand it. They are ignoring it, and that's why things keep getting better and better for us.\n\nMidterm congressional environment\n\nQ: If we are looking at, in the House, 25 to 30 seats changing hands, is there a direct correlation to what can happen in the Senate?\n\nA: Look, at the beginning of (last) year, people said, “Well, there's a chance to win the House and no chance to win the Senate.” But because of the issues that I've talked about and because the House and Senate have been largely in sync on those issues and it's resonating with the American people how we're on their side, I think that the difference between the likelihood of winning the House and the likelihood of winning the Senate has greatly decreased.\n\nQ: Yet at this very moment, at the beginning of the midterm year, would you agree that Democrats have a narrow path back to the Senate majority?\n\nA: I say it is a much wider path than the skeptics think, and a much wider path than it was three months ago and certainly a year ago. And it keeps getting better and better, and we think we have a really good chance of winning back the Senate.\n\nYounger, non-white Trump voters\n\nQ: Younger and non-white voters drifted toward Trump in the last election, as you know. What is your plan, and what will it take for Democrats to win them over?\n\nA: The cost issue is really having an effect already. Look at the elections of 2025. Look at how (Democrat Abigail) Spanberger won by 15 points in Virginia and (Democrat Mikie) Sherrill won by 13 points (in 2025 governor's races). But it wasn't just those two states. We won elections in Georgia. We won elections across the country. And that is because voters, young and old, poor and middle class, don't think Trump was serving them well. So, there's been a whole turnaround about Trump.\n\nAnd in large part, we helped make it happen by focusing on costs.\n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.",

I'm told Harbaugh is encouraged that John Mara, who is battling cancer, plans to be in the office when he gets together with the Giants. Also, kind of cool that Eli reached out…\n\n— Gary Myers (@GaryMyersNY) January 14, 2026\n\nHarbaugh, who spent 18 seasons in Baltimore and won a Super Bowl, has emerged as a top target for general manager Joe Schoen, who has been described as “relentless” in his pursuit of the veteran coach.\n\nReports indicate the Giants are among Harbaugh’s preferred destinations alongside the Atlanta Falcons and Tennessee Titans, and the organization has remained in close contact ahead of the anticipated meeting.\n\nHarbaugh has been selective with interviews and may require personnel influence in any new role. The Giants could interview him in Baltimore if Harbaugh prefers to host candidates there, but early indications are the meeting will take place in East Rutherford.\n\nHarbaugh has already begun studying film on quarterback Jaxson Dart, signaling serious interest in the Giants’ roster.\n\nWith Schoen retained for 2026 and tasked with leading the search, the Giants are also considering other candidates but appear heavily focused on landing the experienced Harbaugh.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: John Harbaugh plans to meet with New York Giants by end of weekend",

    "fullText": "The New York high school boys basketball 2025-26 campaign is heating up around the Empire State as the drive towards the postseason officially begins.\n\nTaking back over the No. 1 spot in our latest New York high school boys basketball rankings are the \nArchbishop Stepinac Crusaders, which are off to a 9-4 start playing against some of the best competition in the country. Top two teams are both Crusaders, but who else should we watch for out of New York when it comes to the state’s top high school boys basketball teams?\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory.\n\nHere’s a way-too-early look at the top 25 teams in the country according to the Massey Ratings, which ranks teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule and margin of victory, as of Jan. 14.\n\nIf you take one look at the roster Archbishop Stepinac (9-4) and you’ll easily see why the Crusaders are near the head of the table in New York. This season, the Crusaders bring back a very senior-laden bunch and super talented in the front and back court. Senior four-star shooting guard Jasiah Jervis returns after averaging a team-high 16.2 points per game last season. The Crusaders will be tough to drive to the rim on as they have a pair of USC commits in 7-footers in Adonis and Darius Ratliff, respectively. Fordham commitment Hassan Koureissi pairs up with Jervis to create one of the best guard combos in the Northeast. This Saturday, Archbishop Stepanic will be taking on one of the top programs in the country in Notre Dame (Calif.).\n\nOne of New York’s top high school boys basketball teams is the Long Island Lutheran Crusaders (5-5) as they feature one of the best overall rosters in the country once again. Though the Crusaders dropped their fifth game of the season recently to CIA Bella Vista Prep, they have played elite competition thus far. What is obvious when taking a look at the talent pool the Crusaders possesses, this team can compete with practically anyone in the nation. Long Island Lutheran has multiple five-star talents in senior 6-foot-5 point guard Dylan Mingo and junior 6-foot-8 forward Moussa Kamissoko. Among other players folks need to have their eyes on that lace ’em up for the Crusaders are Cincinnati commitment Kayden Allen and North Texas pledge TJ Crumble. Long Island Lutheran will be facing Compass Prep (Ariz.) and Montverde Academy (Fla.) at the Hoophall Classic in Massachusetts.\n\nThe St. Francis Preparatory School Terriers (10-2) have continued with their winning ways as they return one of the more talented teams in the New York City region. Key players returning for the Terriers begins with Oesoemana Sacko, who is already committed to Fairfield University, and 6-foot-3 sophomore Justin DeSena. The Terriers’ only two losses on the season have come against Colorado’s No. 1 ranked Ralston Valley and No. 3 Christ The King Regional, respectively.\n\nOne of the top teams out of New York high school boys basketball is Christ The King Regional (9-2), which finished with a 16-14 record last year. The Lions bring back a talented lineup, which includes 2028 three-star point guard Skye Ragoo, who has an offer currently from St. John’s. Playing one of the tougher schedules in the state, Christ the King Regional has already notched some impressive wins, including recently over No. 5 St. Francis Prep. The Lions’ latest game, though, was a 76-66 loss to No. 18 ranked Xaverian (N.Y.).\n\nThe Nazareth Kingsmen (10-5) of Brooklyn enter the Top 5 of our latest New York high school boys basketball rankings this week as this group has really come on hot as of late. Of Nazareth’s losses this season, two of them have come against Archbishop Molloy, but the Kingsmen were able to notch their first victory versus the Stanners. A matchup against No. 2 Archbishop Stepinac last Saturday ended in a 83-61 loss for the Kingsmen as they look to bounce back tonight against No. 3 ranked St. Francis Prep.\n\n6. Cardinal Hayes Cardinals (6-4)\n7. Iona Preparatory School Gaels (8-6) \n8. Thomas Jefferson Campus Orange Wave (7-5) \n9. St. Raymond For Boys Ravens (5-7)\n10. Poly Prep Blue Devils (1-1)\n\n11. Albany Academy Cadets (2-1)\n12. Archbishop Molloy Stanners (10-6) \n13. Lawrence Woodmere Academy Tigers (0-0)\n14. Christian Brothers Academy Brothers (7-0)\n15. St. John’s Prep Red Storm (5-0)\n\n16. Fairport Red Raiders (7-0)\n17. Xaverian Clippers (6-3)\n18. Westhill Warriors (9-1)\n19. South Shore Vikings (7-5)\n20. Shaker Bison (8-2)\n\n21. Msgr Scanlan Crusaders (8-4) \n22. Chaminade Flyers (6-4) \n23. Canarsie Wolfpack (9-4) \n24. Mount Vernon (5-2)\n25. Shenendehowa Plainsmen (8-1)\n\nFor New York high school boys basketball fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "fullText": "Jets predicted to trade for $212 million QB in lieu of Dante Moore originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAssuming that Fernando Mendoza is the No. 1 overall NFL Draft pick by the Las Vegas Raiders, the New York Jets will have to cross their fingers.\n\nDante Moore isn't a lock to come out of Oregon and enter the draft. He'd be the only clear QB2 in a class that isn't as strong as once thought.\n\nIf Moore stays in school, the Jets may have to pursue a different route at the quarterback position.\n\nBleacher Report's Alex Ballentine suggests an outside the box option: Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nTagovailoa has multiple years remaining on what was originally a $212 million contract with the Miami Dolphins. It'd be a fascinating intra-division trade.\n\nBecause it'd be a salary dump, the Jets in this projected trade actually also receive a second-round pick and cash while only giving up a fifth-round pick.\n\n\"For all of Tua Tagovailoa's faults, he is 44-32 as a starter,\" Ballentine writes. \"Tagovailoa said he would be open to a fresh start after a season in which he ended on the bench. The only problem is that he's only one year into his four-year extension. The Jets are uniquely positioned to help the Dolphins out. They have $93.7 million in cap space, which is plenty to take on a significant portion of Tagovailoa's contract before cutting it in 2027 with little additional cost. That would help the Jets win now while adding to their draft pick stockpile and showing some creativity in navigating their rebuild under Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey.\"\n\nMIKE TOMLIN NEWS: What it means for Rodgers | TV future | Tomlin trade potential | Cignetti?\n\nIt would certainly be fascinating to see the Jets' leadership group put their futures in the hands of Tagovailoa.\n\nIt's hard to know if Tua could be good enough without a talented receiving corps, but maybe he needs the change of scenery more than anything else.\n\nThe narratives would be great if this happened, for sure.\n\nPatriots, Drake Maye silence doubters with callback to Brady, Belichick\n\nA.J. Brown makes a disrespectful decision after season-ending loss\n\nIt's harder to become Steelers coach than it is to become Pope\n\nReddit proves Justin Herbert turns into Shedeur Sanders in the playoffs\n\nBills, Josh Allen never stopped pushing, and the Super Bowl dream is alive\n\nPanthers make decision on Bryce Young's future in Carolina",

    "description": "Taking a look at a Jets cornerback",
    "fullText": "Over the next few months, we’ll be taking an in-depth look at some of the late season signings who are under contract for 2026, and futures signings after the end of the season. We continue today with cornerback Samuel Womack, who signed a futures deal on the day after the season ended, having been elevated from the practice squad to start the season finale.\n\nThe 26-year old Womack is listed at 5’10” and 189 pounds and was a fifth round pick out of Toledo in 2022. He has started 11 games in his career so far, including eight with the Colts in 2024, and has racked up 73 tackles, 13 pass breakups and three interceptions in 46 career games.\n\nWomack was a productive receiver and cornerback in high school but wasn’t ranked by any of the main outlets so he had to walk on at Toledo. However, he saw action in seven games as a true freshman and recorded four tackles and an interception.\n\nHe continued to play a rotational role in 2018 but did make his first career start as he had 12 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss and a pass breakup in 13 games.\n\nOver the next three years, Womack moved into a starting role and was productive as he had 59 tackles, 15 pass breakups and two interceptions in 2019 followed by 20 tackles and eight pass breakups in just six games in 2020. He was then named as a first-team all-MAC selection in his final season in 2021 as he had 32 tackles, 18 passes defensed and two more interceptions.\n\nDespite not being invited to the scouting combine, Womack had a good pro day and was ultimately drafted by the 49ers in the fifth round.\n\nAs a rookie, Womack made one start and ended the season with 19 tackles, an interception and a forced fumble. However, his second season was disrupted by injuries and he had just seven tackles in seven games.\n\nHaving been released in final cuts by the 49ers after the 2024 preseason, he was claimed on waivers by the Colts and made a good impact with them as he had an excellent season. He started eight games and racked up 36 tackles, nine pass breakups and two interceptions.\n\nDespite this, he failed to make the roster in 2025 and ended up on the Titans for whom he made five appearances including one start. He had four tackles and a pass breakup. However, he was waived again in November and ended up on the Jets’ practice squad in December.\n\nWomack didn’t play until the season finale but was in on every snap and had seven tackles and a pass breakup in a solid performance and then signed a futures deal the next day.\n\nLet’s move onto some more in-depth analysis of what Womack brings to the table as a player, based on extensive research and film study.\n\nWomack has average size and length but posted some good numbers at his pro day where he ran a 4.40 in the 40-yard dash and managed a 36-inch vertical jump and solid agility numbers. His broad jump was below average and he did not participate in the bench press.\n\nWomack primarily played on the outside during his career, but he did see extensive action in the slot in a couple of games in his final season at Toledo and then got some work there with the 49ers in his rookie year both in preseason and the regular season. He also played there in preseason in 2024.\n\nWith the Colts and Titans, and with the Jets in the season finale, he played exclusively outside.\n\nWomack’s coverage numbers in college were excellent as he allowed a catch on less than half of his targets and never got beaten for more than four touchdowns in a season.\n\nAt the NFL level, he has given up nine touchdowns in his career, including six in 2024 alone. However, at some points during that season he was ranking among the league leaders in categories such as forced incompletion rate and snaps per reception allowed.\n\nHis balance, anticipation and movement skills are good and his film shows plenty of examples of being able to stay with his man.\n\nHis biggest issue seems to be inconsistent footwork, which can lead to him being beaten off the line.\n\nWhile he can run stride for stride with receivers on deep routes, he can struggle to recover when a bigger receiver gets a clean release off the line.\n\nWomack posted spectacular on-ball numbers in college. In fact, he is ranked 11th all-time in NCAA history for passes defensed despite only having three seasons (one of them pandemic-shortened) as a starter. He led the MAC three straight years in that category and twice placed in the top-four in the nation.\n\nHe showcased his timing and ability to disrupt on this play in the season finale, where he played the defender’s hands to perfection.\n\nIn terms of interceptions, which is of course something the Jets are desperate to add to their team, Womack had five in college and has three in regular season action at the NFL level. He also had two \n\nWhile run defense isn’t a major part of Womack’s game as an outside corner, it’s something he got better at over the course of his college career and it hasn’t proved to be a weakness for him at the pro level as some analysts anticipated.\n\nMissed tackles were another thing that some analysts thought might be an issue for Womack at the pro level, due to his average size and a perceived lack of play strength. This was despite the fact his tackle efficiency numbers in college weren’t too bad. Again, though, this hasn’t really been a problem in the pros, although he has had five missed tackles, all in 2024.\n\nHe had one forced fumble in his rookie season.\n\nAt times, Womack has used his hands well to jam at the line or redirect within five yards of the line of scrimmage, although this wasn’t really his primary role with the Colts or Titans.\n\nHe had 13 penalties during his college career with some analysts picking up on the fact that he would grab from time to time. However, he only has one defensive holding and one pass interference penalty at the pro level.\n\nAlthough he isn’t big, he is capable of making some aggressive tackles.\n\nWomack has hardly ever blitzed at the NFL level, although he did have a quarterback hit in a preseason game. He had this half-sack in college.\n\nWomack has had plenty of experience on all the main special teams units including as a vice on the punt return team and a gunner on punt coverage.\n\nHe wasn’t that productive in college, where he had as many penalties (three) as special teams tackles, but he has nine special teams tackles at the NFL level and made this impressive play at the goal line.\n\nHe did false start once on a punt though.\n\nWomack has displayed an ability to make quick reads and come up to make plays close to the line of scrimmage. In addition, he looks comfortable in terms of his assignment responsibilities in zone coverage.\n\nAs a former walk-on, Womack has displayed determination to get to this level and has been similarly defiant when released by the 49ers, Colts and Titans. He believes he deserves more of a chance to show what he can do and brings good energy and communication skills.\n\nOn-field discipline hasn’t been an issue with just three defensive penalties at the NFL level, although one was for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nWomack spent five weeks on injured reserve in 2023, then returned in November, after suffering an MCL sprain in his knee. Otherwise, he has only been affected by minor injuries and illness during his career so far.\n\nIt was surprising to see Womack unable to make the Colts roster this year after a strong 2024 season, but he reportedly really struggled in Lou Anarumo’s new system.\n\nThat scheme sees the Colts mix up their coverages and packages a lot more than in the past and Womack apparently struggled in camp with giving up catches and penalties.\n\nHe perhaps looked at his most confident when playing in the Colts’ zone heavy schemes but he has handled man and press assignments in the past so it may have been the multiple nature of the system that he struggled to get to grips with.\n\nHe was a teammate of current Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell with the Colts.\n\nWomack’s performance in the season finale stood out as a rare bright spot for the Jets that day, and going back over his career so far suggests that he has some ability and potential that could give him a realistic shot at a roster spot with the Jets next season.\n\nAaron Glenn has brought in a series of defensive backs that he says fits what the Jets do and Womack slotted right into the lineup and did a solid job which sets him up well to perform at training camp next season.\n\nOf course, we don’t know who the new defensive coordinator is going to be and, judging by what happened in Indianapolis, there’s a chance Womack might not fit in as well after this change is made. However, based on his talent alone, it’s too soon to write off Womack as a replacement level player and the Jets may have made a shrewd acquisition of an overlooked cornerback who could prove useful.",

    "description": "Two of the NFL's least successful teams are working with multiple first round picks in 2026. How could Cleveland and New York fix things?",
    "fullText": "For three quarters of the NFL, the 2026 offseason has begun. That means Super Bowl hopes and dreams have been replaced by scouting reports and salary cap debates.\n\nThat means, for 24 teams, it's draft season.\n\nThe 2026 NFL Draft is modest when it comes to quarterback talent but still loaded with players who can change the fortunes of a franchise. Pass rushers, wideouts, cornerbacks and reinforcements on both sides of the trenches are waiting to hear their names called in April. Let's see who fits where and make some educated guesses.\n\nPlease note this draft was completed before Monday night's Wild Card game between the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers, so draft position among the top 24 picks was determined using the betting spread of that game (a projected three-point Texans win).\n\nGeno Smith can be kept for about $8 million more than his dead cap number. While he might be a useful veteran mentor, he's also the guy who flipped off his home fans in his first year in Las Vegas, so... Aidan O'Connell will probably be the experienced (well, kinda) hand that turns things over to a polished rookie next August.\n\nMendoza's elite downfield accuracy means he'll dazzle when it comes to advanced stats like completion percentage over expected (CPOE). He balances pinpoint throws with strong, quick decision making and enough athleticism to keep defenses wary of his run game. While he lacks elite physical traits, you can't argue with his outcomes. Las Vegas needs a winner -- ideally immediately given how quickly it's cycled through head coaches. Mendoza has been wrecking shop at INDIANA.\n\nMoore has more physical tools in his box than Mendoza, but he's not as polished as the Heisman Trophy winner. Still, it's not difficult to see how a quick release and the arm strength to whip a deep shot through a rapidly closing window make him a tantalizing NFL prospect.\n\nThe Oregon star can break down under pressure and will need some time to acclimate to the NFL. Picking up a wideout with the pick acquired from the Colts in the Sauce Gardner trade (or, later on, the second round acquired from the Cowboys in the Quinnen Williams trade) could find him some badly needed receiving help to ease his transition.\n\nJosh Sweat was one of the few bright spots in Arizona last fall, racking up a career-high 12 sacks in his first season with the club. Only one other Cardinal had more than two, and that was 39-year-old Calais Campbell.\n\nArizona needs help just about everywhere but tight end. Reese's versatility can help him plug holes in a few places along the defense but most notably as a pass rusher. He had 10 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks in his All-American 2025.\n\nTexas Tech stud David Bailey is worth a look here, but Bain's playoff performance is too fresh to ignore. The 6-foot-3, 275 pound edge rushing monster had 5.5 tackles for loss and four sacks in the Hurricanes' first two CFP games, setting the stage for a push even further up draft boards.\n\nHis get-off and closing speed hit like a series of small explosions, making him an absolute nightmare to block and a haunting presence to escape. The Titans badly need an influx of talent; Bain may be the best raw prospect of 2026.\n\nTate's ability to create space with savvy route running, strong hands and upper crust ball tracking would be a rising tide for New York's cache of young skill players. Malik Nabers' double-teams would drop. Cam Skattebo (and Tyrone Tracy, if he ever re-enters the circle of trust) would face fewer stacked boxes.\n\nAnd Jaxson Dart, importantly, would have more options downfield that don't require him to lower his shoulder and run face-first into the concussion protocol (he probably still will. He just won't *have* to). Wideout isn't the team's biggest need, but it could be the catalyst that revives an inefficient offense.\n\nThe Browns allowed pressure on a league-high 46.5 percent of their dropbacks -- four percent higher than the second-worst Chargers, who were missing their starting tackles most of the season. Four different linemen who played at least 69 percent of the team's snaps are set for free agency. Spending room is sparse, in large part thanks to Deshaun Watson, formerly accused of more than 20 counts of sexual misconduct and what the NFL described as \"predatory behavior,\" and his albatross contract.\n\nThe easiest fix is to find a dynamic starter on a rookie deal. Here, Cleveland has its choice. Fano gets the nod thanks to his absurd power and athleticism at 6-foot-6 and 305 pounds. That athleticism boosts his recovery when beaten, which will be an asset when squaring up with rookie mistakes and elite edge rushers.\n\nTerry McLaurin is locked in, but Jayden Daniels' targets get iffy after that. Deebo Samuel is a pending free agent. So is Zach Ertz, who is coming off a season-ending ACL tear. Daniels badly needs a boost after backsliding in 2025 due to injury and lackluster play.\n\nTyson is a jetpack. The Arizona State star is good at just about everything, but shines hardest when it comes to breaking off cornerbacks at the top of his route and creating the space for clutch pickups. Sticky hands and elite recognition make him a dynamic closer on 50/50 balls as well -- though he could stand to bulk up a bit to withstand the rigors of a 17-game season.\n\nNeeds: CB, IOL, EDGE, LB, RB, WR\n\nNew Orleans could have used Tate or Tyson. Taking a player like Makai Lemon or Denzel Boston could be a bit of a reach here. Good news! The Saints also need help at another position that would boost Tyler Shough after a promising rookie season.\n\nEnter Love, who'd be a boon to a tailback rotation that got below-average returns from Alvin Kamara and Devin Neal last fall. His value as a runner (nearly seven yards per carry the last two seasons) and receiver (280 yards, three touchdowns in 12 games this fall) give New Orleans a dynamic replacement for Kamara and rising tide to the offense, albeit at considerable expense for a running back.\n\nReleasing Jawaan Taylor could save up to $20 million in salary cap space for 2026. Jaylon Moore hasn't been great and is only under contract through 2026. Josh Simmons was uneven and injured as a rookie, though his ceiling is massive. After Patrick Mahomes faced pressure on at least 42 percent of his dropbacks in his final two games of his 2025 (two games that washed Kansas City out of the postseason race), the Chiefs reload to keep their star QB comfortable.\n\nMauigoa is a rampart in pass protection, but he's truly devastating in space where his 315-pound frame flies upfield to demolish poor, poor linebackers. He's in the running with Fano to be the first tackle off the board in 2026.\n\nTrey Hendrickson won't be coming back, leaving the league's 25th-ranked pass rush in dire need. Maybe 2025 first round pick Shemar Stewart will get there, but he was always a project whose growth was further stunted by a truly pointless contract standoff last season.\n\nBailey brings proven production that Stewart did not, racking up a Big 12-leading 19.5 tackles for loss and an FBS-leading 14.5 sacks after departing Stanford for a hefty payday at Texas Tech. His explosive get-off and devastating closing speed means he can man the second level, but at 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds he's not so small he can't handle edge duties in Ohio (Joseph Ossai, for example, only has an inch and about 15 pounds on him). He's not a perfect fit, but Cincinnati gets a chance to course correct by taking an NFL-ready pass rusher in the first round.\n\nIn theory, Miami's next coach could use this pick to pump up his offense with another athletic marvel and make tight end Kenyon Sadiq a Dolphin. But whomever succeeds Mike McDaniel badly needs to address the league's 25th-ranked defense. And, lo and behold, Miami has a need at safety and Downs has slid out of the top 10.\n\nDowns can play deep or near the line of scrimmage and line up tracking slot receivers with ease. His NFL ceiling is \"Brian Branch, but better.\" He's a fixer, plain and simple, in a Miami defense in need of playmakers.\n\nDoes Jerry Jones truly want to shore up his run defense? If so, Clemson's Peter Woods could be the call here. Is he in the market for a Trevon Diggs replacement? There's Mansoor Delane and Jermod McCoy, among others. But the combination of need and cost savings at a high cost position instead shift the focus to Faulk, a high potential pass rusher who could lift a team that went from a top-four pressure rate with Micah Parsons in the lineup to the middle of the NFL pack without him.\n\nFaulk brings proven production (seven sacks in 2024 before this fall's down year) and the size Cincinnati covets up front (6-foot-6, 285 pounds). He's not a one-dimensional edge rusher, either; he has legitimate chops on the ground for a defense that ranked 29th in rushing EPA allowed in 2025.\n\nThe Rams only have three pending free agents who played more than 50 percent of the teams snaps on offense or defense. All three are defensive backs, including Cobie Durant. Darious Williams is 32 years old. 2026 presents a wonderful opportunity for LA to take the draft's first cornerback.\n\nEnter Delane, who led the SEC with 11 pass breakups and hauled in a pair of interceptions in 11 games. He can be trusted in single coverage on the sideline, with fluid hips and turn-and-go speed to keep up with NFL deep threats. His trustworthiness on an island could mean more blitzes for the Rams -- and an even scarier defense.\n\nThis is a pick that may hinge on Baltimore's next head coach. But this is a franchise with a definite identity. Landing a hoss like Woods who can set a bruising tone up front would help the Ravens get back to it.\n\nWoods, a 315-pound fairy tale monster with absurd quickness and athleticism, is set to jump up draft boards at the 2026 Scouting Combine. He lands in the top half of the draft here, pairing with Justin Madubuike to give Baltimore some world-class BEEF in the middle of its line and make life easier for the defenders behind them.\n\nLavonte David cannot possibly keep doing this forever. Please welcome his replacement, a taller, faster version of Lavonte David.\n\nStyles is a former safety who plays like it (complimentary), using elite athleticism to create problems at every level. He has the speed to turn and run with slot receivers and the physicality to meet a running back at the line of scrimmage and leave him with nothing but regret.\n\nWith Moore on board, several options to punch up his receiving corps persist. But while solid wideouts will last into Day 2, there may only be one chance to draft 2026's top tight end. With apologies to Denzel Boston and Makai Lemon, Sadiq is the pick.\n\nThe Oregon tight end is an athletic marvel and solid blocker who can seal off running lanes or get out in space to deflect defensive backs. More importantly, he's got excellent speed up the seam and quick change-of-direction skills to snap off linebackers and slot corners. Pair that with solid hands and, baby, you've got a stew going.\n\nDetroit needs a pass rusher big enough to hold down the edge and the intelligence to react and adjust as plays unfold. The 6-foot-3, 265 pound Parker qualifies as a valuable counterweight to Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nThough his numbers tailed off after last year's absurd 19.5-TFL, 11-sack campaign, he remains a versatile piece with a high ceiling and useful floor. He's violent at the point of attack, using a quick punch and active hands to shed blockers, though he's fast enough to win with speed on the edge as well.\n\nByron Murphy and Isaiah Rodgers played well in 2025, but there's no such thing as too many talented quarterbacks in a defense as aggressive as Brian Flores'. Adding McCoy would create space to shift Rodgers to the slot, adding strength over the middle alongside a young player who can be trusted on the boundary.\n\nMcCoy's torn ACL kept him from shining in 2025, but his four-interception 2024 proved he's a shadow in coverage, rarely allowing space thanks to fluid hips, elite quickness and vital recognition skills. He's an asset in man coverage from the line of scrimmage, and erasing quick-outs is a specialty -- something that would be a boon for the Vikings' pressure in the pocket.\n\nThe Panthers are running out of time to decide whether Bryce Young can be their franchise quarterback. After Tetairoa McMillan and Jalen Coker made up 81 percent of their receiving output in a Wild Card loss to the Rams, it's clear Carolina could use help to maximize its young passer.\n\nLemon's size at 5-foot-10 is a concern, but putting him in a lineup across from 6-foot-4 McMillan and 6-foot-3 Coker alleviates that. More importantly, he gives the team another man coverage beater with elite acceleration and quickness who can thrive in the short/intermediate zone in the space McMillan creates.\n\nOhio State's Kayden McDonald could be an answer up front with Kenny Clark on the wrong side of 30. But cornerback is a more pressing need and a top-three prospect has slid into Dallas' range.\n\nNot a single defensive back in the Cowboys locker room finished 2025 with a passer rating under 99 when targeted. Terrell, with 22 breakups the last two seasons (and eight! forced! fumbles!) would be rain to that desert. With elite acceleration and lateral movement, he's difficult to shake -- even if he's a bit smaller than Jerry Jones might prefer at under six feet tall.\n\nSure, a quarterback would be nice here -- but Ty Simpson here feels destined to end up like Kenny Pickett before him. It could be a wideout, but with Lemon off the board Pittsburgh may opt to play into tradition and coach up a receiver selected on Day 2 instead. Thus, we get Banks, a massive lineman who can play multiple roles but, most importantly, can succeed Cameron Heyward and pair with Derrick Harmon and Keeanu Benton to give the Steelers' a terrifying young defensive front.\n\nBanks has to refine his game, but his raw talent would make him a tantalizing lump of clay for a franchise that's expertly molded defensive talent. He's explosive at the snap and elusive laterally, allowing him to shed blocks and contribute all three downs. While injury limited him to three games this season and dented his draft stock, he may be due for a pre-draft rise this spring.\n\nZion Johnson has been frustrating in his time as a Charger and headed to free agency. Jim Harbaugh can pluck a Big Ten star to replace him months after the Patriots ended his season by brutalizing poor Justin Herbert.\n\nIoane, Iowa's Gennings Dunker or Oregon's Emmanuel Pregnon could be the call here, but let's start with the Nittany Lion. He's a brick wall at 330 pounds and has the quickness and aggression to create space at the second level -- something Jim Harbaugh will absolutely love as he establishes the run.\n\nThe Eagles haven't been shy about taking a legendary offensive lineman's replacement early in the draft while he's still on the roster. Cam Jurgens was drafted in 2022 to take over for Jason Kelce. Now comes Lomu ahead of whatever Lane Johnson decides comes next.\n\nPhiladelphia's pressure rate allowed actually decreased between 2024 and 2025, but all was not well across an offensive front whose struggles tied into an overall regression this fall. Lomu is a high level athlete who adjusted to Big 12 play with aplomb, showcasing All-Pro upside for the right head coach. Given the Eagles' success with homegrown and retread blockers in the past, his upside is too much to pass up.\n\nWith a blocking upgrade secured in the top 10, the Browns take the next step to elevate whichever poor, unfortunate soul has to play quarterback next season. It's too early to write off Jerry Jeudy even after his disastrous 2025. Instead, he gets a little help -- and another big body alongside Harold Fannin Jr. to serve as a playmaking threat.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Boston is a bail out machine on jump balls, but his biggest strength comes breaking off defenders in the mid-range. That would make him kind of a super-sized Kayshon Boutte. We've seen how nicely Drake Maye has leaned on Boutte en route to an All-Pro second season, correct?\n\nThe draft board has been kind to the Bears -- even at No. 25 they have a wide array of top-level prospects to choose from at positions of need. Secondary and offensive line help is waiting, but Howell's value for the league's 27th-ranked pass rush is massive.\n\nHowell led the SEC with 11 sacks. While he doesn't have an enormous frame at 6-foot-2 and 250 pounds, his versatile pass rushing attack makes him an asset even in Chicago's 4-3 alignment. His ability to use his speed to create leverage and then toss off blockers suggests he could help fix what ails the Bears.\n\nBuffalo could fall in love with a wideout here, but there will be time to address the position on Day 2. Finding a young stud who can keep the middle of the line chugging forward with both Connor McGovern and David Edwards headed to free agency, however, is a tougher call. Dunker could step in immediately to pair with O'Cyrus Torrence as a road-grading young duo at guard.\n\nThe Iowa tackle will likely kick inside due to his arm length but can hold his own on the edge if needed. More importantly, he's mean as hell, quick at the point of attack and difficult to move backward. So, pretty standard Hawkeye stuff.\n\nTrent Williams has to retire someday. We saw how lost the Niners looked without him in stretches in 2025. The Niners' postseason success has prevented them from at least a couple potential saviors earlier in round one, but they still get a good one here. Proctor is enormous; 6-foot-7 and more than 360 pounds.\n\nHe's got the strength to match that frame, but his athleticism belongs to a much smaller man -- including a 32-inch vertical leap despite being the same weight as a Smart car. He's solid as a shadow, and while pad level and lateral quickness will always be a concern with a player his size he should make an immediate impact if Williams doesn't return for 2026.\n\nAh crap, we let the Texans get another elite defensive prospect. McDonald is an anchor up front, damn near impossible to move at 326 pounds. But he's also blessed with an explosive opening salvo that fires him into gaps and shrinks pocket space from the inside-out. Now he gets to pair up with Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter.\n\nCould this be a spot for Alabama's Ty Simpson to serve as Matthew Stafford's apprentice? It's possible, but Allen's availability and the need to add dynamic, young athletic talent to the middle of the field makes the Georgia linebacker the pick.\n\nAllen can handle pass rushing duties as well as lock down the middle of the field in coverage or against the run. He's not huge at 6-foot-1 and 235 pounds, but he moves quickly and fluidity, rarely crossing himself up and sticking to receivers in coverage. He's also a bonafide thumper who can move Omar Speights into pending free agent Troy Reeder's role as a rotational presence.\n\nNew England's pass rush was a strength in its Wild Card win over the Chargers, but K'Lavon Chaisson is a free agent and Harold Landry turns 30 this summer. Reloading here would help create positional savings that will be vital once Drake Maye signs a record-setting contract extension.\n\nUiagalelei can break into the lineup as a pass rushing specialist while fleshing out his game. He's an athletic marvel who looks the part of an NFL star but still needs to refine his game. But with power and speed in droves, he'd bring a stable floor to a position of need for Mike Vrabel.\n\nCisse's turn-and-run ability and elite acceleration suggest he's going to be an absolute darling at the combine. That raw athletic ability is backed by an inconsistent approach -- his 78.9 passer rating in Columbia last season was solid but his 20-plus yards allowed per reception were not. Fortunately, he lands here with a head coach capable of extracting the very best from him.\n\nCisse occasionally plays over-excited, biting on double-moves and adding some boom-bust to his game. Mike Macdonald can fix that. If he can, there's a player with All-Pro potential waiting underneath.\n\nAlex Singleton is a pending free agent on the wrong side of 30. Denver needs a running mate next to Dre Greenlaw in the middle of the field. Hill can do that.\n\nThe Texas star is a smart linebacker who identifies plays and gets where he needs to be to stop them. His coverage continues to develop, but that's a weakness that the rest of the Broncos' defense can help cover as he develops it into a strength.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: NFL mock draft: Can Jets, Browns double-dips save their franchises?",

Duarte (@michaeljduarte) January 12, 2026\n\nCharly Hill, who graduated from Miami in 2024 and has interned and freelanced at Bleacher Report, TNT Sports and NBC, joined as a sports content creator.\n\nI’m not typically active on Twitter, but that’s all about to change with my new role at the California Post as a Sports Content Creator\n\nSo excited to be a part of what’s shaping up to be an incredible year for California sports! pic.twitter.com/EOieGODH0b\n\n— charly d (@charlydyannhill) January 8, 2026\n\nBolch, who has covered UCLA athletics for the Los Angeles Times for more than a decade and spent 26 years at the paper overall, becomes the latest high-profile addition for the California Post, which has aggressively targeted established Southern California journalists to anchor its coverage.\n\nHis move follows the recent exits of former Los Angeles Times sports columnist Dylan Hernandez and Dodgers beat writer Jack Harris, who  announced last month they were joining the California Post.\n\nWith Bolch’s departure, the Los Angeles Times is now left with just nine full-time sports staff writers, a stark contraction for a paper that once boasted one of the deepest sports departments in the country.\n\nOutside of the editors, the Los Angeles Times sports staff is currently led by columnist Bill Plaschke, senior writers Bill Shaikin and Kevin Baxter, Thuc Nhi Nguyen and Broderick Turner on the Lakers, Ryan Kartje on USC, Gary Klein on the Rams, Sam Farmer on the Chargers and Eric Sondheimer on high schools.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times was slated to have the second-largest contingent of sports staffers covering the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo behind NBC, which is the broadcast home of the Olympics, before the pandemic. The plan at the time, according to sources, was to send 14 reporters and photographers to Tokyo to produce a separate daily color section, as it first did in 1984 when the games were held in Los Angeles. The Times will be covering next month’s Winter Games in Italy with one writer as Thuc Nhi Nguyen will be taking a break from the Lakers beat to cover the games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nWhen Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018, he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” Since the pandemic in 2020, however, the sports section has been reduced to the final four or five pages of the California section five days a week, with a standalone sports section of six to eight pages appearing only twice per week.\n\nDespite its statewide branding, the California Post's initial sports coverage will be centered squarely on Los Angeles, with a primary emphasis on the sports and teams the Los Angeles Times still covers in the Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA.\n\nHernandez and Harris will lead its MLB and Dodgers coverage, while Southern California News Group Lakers beat writer Khobi Price and longtime Lakers reporter Melissa Rohlin, who joined the Post last week, will anchor its NBA and Lakers coverage. Bonsignore will lead the NFL and Rams coverage while Bolch will lead college sports coverage, focusing on USC and UCLA.\n\nThe staffing losses at the Los Angeles Times come amid continued upheaval at the paper, which has faced newsroom cuts, buyouts and mounting uncertainty about its long-term investment in daily sports coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Post is not done hiring. Sources familiar with the startup’s plans say the outlet is continuing to pursue additional Times sports writers and other well-known local journalists before its launch on Jan. 26.",
