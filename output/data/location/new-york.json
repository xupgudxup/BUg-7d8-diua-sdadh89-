    "fullText": "The New York Jets officially ended the soul searching portion of their offseason today, announcing the hire of Frank Reich as their new offensive coordinator.\n\nIn a move that feels both like a safe veteran play and a massive gamble, Head Coach Aaron Glenn has effectively handed Reich the keys to the kingdom. Glenn made it clear during the search that he wanted a head coach of the offense someone who could operate with total autonomy while Glenn refocuses on calling the defensive plays.\n\nBut for Jets fans, the question isn’t about Reich’s resume. It’s about which version of the man is stepping off the plane at Newark.\n\nTo understand the anxiety at One Jets Drive, you have to look at the two polar opposite outcomes of Reich’s recent career.\n\nThe Quarterback Whisperer (2017-2020) This is the Reich the Jets are praying for. This is the architect who helped Doug Pederson guide Nick Foles to a Super Bowl ring. This is the man who took a washed Philip Rivers in 2020 and squeezed out an 11-5 playoff season. This version of Reich is Multiple in the best way he adapts his scheme to his players, uses RPOs to protect his QB, and leans on a physical run game to set up deep shots.\n\nThe Scheme Rigid Veteran (2022-2023) This is the Reich who was fired mid season in back to back years. In Carolina, he was criticized for trying to force Bryce Young into a static pocket system that didn’t fit the rookie’s traits. The offense became predictable, horizontal, and frankly boring. This version of Reich prioritizes the system over the personnel, resulting in an offense that ranks in the bottom five of every meaningful category.\n\nIf Reich returns to his roots, the biggest winners are Breece Hall(If we bring him back. Please come back!) and Garrett Wilson.\n\nThe Run Game: Reich’s best years in Indy featured a dominant Jonathan Taylor. With Breece Hall, Reich has a weapon that can execute the Wide Zone scheme that defines his best work.\n\nThe X Factor: Garrett Wilson is the perfect rhythm receiver for Reich’s West Coast hybrid. If Reich can get back to the Triangle Reads and Mesh concepts that made the 2017 Eagles so dangerous, Wilson could see a career high in targets.",

    "description": "A single mom juggling multiple jobs, grad school, and rising costs explains what it takes to stay in New York City — and why she may have to leave.",
    "fullText": "Massiel Lugo hit the New York lottery — and it's why she can afford to stay in the city she grew up in.\n\nThe 33-year-old single mother of two took over her aunt's lease in Jackson Heights, Queens, when her second child was born. Moving into the two-bedroom was only possible because her aunt, also a single mother, left the city for a more affordable life in Georgia.\n\n\"I remember watching her struggle a lot, and then she could no longer do it on her own, and she just got up and left,\" Lugo said.\n\nWhile Lugo's apartment isn't rent-stabilized, she inherited a six-year-old lease, and her landlord has held off on raising her rent to market rate, which is around $2,900 for the typical two-bedroom in the area. Still, the Queens native wonders if she should follow in her aunt's footsteps and leave the city.\n\nWhen her son's father moved out about five years ago, Lugo sublet her second bedroom and skipped meals to make ends meet. These days, she manages to pay her $1,700 rent by juggling multiple jobs while going to school. It helps that her 16-year-old daughter, Jalene, has taken paid internships, and her parents, who live four blocks away, help care for her eight-year-old son, Ozzie, who has autism.\n\nBut the city that's always been home is feeling increasingly hostile. A growing share of New Yorkers are struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world as the costs of basic necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that's driven up rents and home prices. Family-sized apartments with two or three bedrooms are especially hard to come by. The cost crisis is pushing many out of the city, particularly families with young children and lower-income Black and Hispanic residents.\n\nNew York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, got elected on a pledge to bring these costs down. In January, he and Gov. Kathy Hochul rolled out their plan to significantly expand free and low-cost childcare for young children. Lugo was invited by the mayor's team to an event celebrating the announcement. While she supports the efforts, her kids are too old to benefit from them. Lugo and her family could see cost savings through other mayoral proposals, including free buses, city-owned grocery stores, and more affordable housing.\n\nLugo is among the more than 40% of the city's renters who spend more than a third of their gross income on housing. Her traditionally working-class immigrant neighborhood is under pressure from gentrification and the rising cost of living. At the same time, the streets and subways don't feel as safe as they did when Lugo was growing up.\n\n\"It's a love-hate relationship with New York,\" she said. \"At the end of the day, it's home, but it has changed so much.\"\n\nFor the last several years, Lugo worked both as a teacher's assistant in a public school and as a therapist for children with autism while earning her bachelor's degree. In January, she started a master's program to become a certified therapist for autistic children.\n\nOver the last few years, she's pieced together between $50,000 and $60,000 in income from her jobs and monthly child support. However, she's working less this semester to make more time for graduate school, which costs her $1,300 per semester. Eventually, she hopes to make upwards of $80,000 as a full-time certified therapist.\n\nIn the meantime, her income is barely enough to cover her family's expenses. Transportation and grocery costs have ballooned. Food costs in New York City rose by about 68% between 2013 and 2023 — much more than the national average of 49%, the state comptroller found. Lugo is an ALICE, which stands for asset-limited, income-constrained, employed, and describes someone who makes too much to qualify for most assistance, but still struggles to get by. She no longer gets food stamps, and her grocery bills have ballooned as her kids have gotten older.\n\n\"I buy food, and it's just gone,\" she said. \"I never thought I would yell at my kids, like, 'Did you guys really just finish all the juice boxes in a day?'\"\n\nDespite living a block from the 7 subway train and multiple bus lines, Lugo said she's increasingly found herself taking Ubers, in part because Ozzie is sensitive to the noise on public transit. It helps that Jalene rides transit for free because she's a public school student, and Ozzie takes a city-provided school bus because of his diagnosis.\n\nShe's also racked up about $7,000 in credit card debt by treating her kids to occasional meals out and new clothes. She was late on her rent payment last month after putting more money toward paying down her credit card.\n\n\"I used to be really good at saving, but my mindset has changed a lot. I'm just like, what am I saving up for?\" she said. \"I want to travel, I want to make memories with my kids, and that's become more of a priority for me.\"\n\nWhen Lugo's parents first moved to Queens from the Dominican Republic about 45 years ago, life was affordable for them, Lugo said. Some of her aunts and uncles were even able to buy co-ops in the area.\n\nBut the neighborhood has gentrified. Lugo remembers when the first Starbucks opened up in Jackson Heights in 2008 — it felt like a turning point. A few years ago, her father closed the bodega he owned for decades when the building was sold to a developer. The neighborhood has felt less safe in recent years, she said, with a rise in illegal brothels and disorder on the streets.\n\nLugo isn't ready to leave the city, but she'd like to raise her kids in a quieter neighborhood. She dreams of moving to Bayside, a wealthier, more suburban part of Queens, but rent and transportation costs out there would be even higher. She thinks that finding any other apartment similar in price and size to her own would be nearly impossible in the city.\n\nJalene has her sights set on Yale and wants to eventually become a lawyer. Lugo has told her she can only move away for college if she gets a full ride.\n\n\"I tell her, 'I want you to live your life. I want you to be a child, but you need to work extremely hard, because a studio is $2,000 right now. I can only imagine how much your generation is going to have to pay in the future,'\" Lugo said.",

    "description": "Among other things, Hofstra wrestler Will Conlon also likes to read and lists “Catcher in the Rye” as his favorite book.  Conlon doesn’t compare himself to the 16-year-old main character, created in the 1951 classic novel by J.D. Salinger, who dealt with the reality of adulthood in a much grimier era in New York City.  “It’s actually more of a suburban area and what I’m used to,” said Conlon, who grew up outside of Birmingham, and does find time to enjoy today’s New York City.",
    "fullText": "Among other things, Hofstra wrestler Will Conlon also likes to read and lists “Catcher in the Rye” as his favorite book.\n\n“I read that for my 12th-grade AP literature class,” said the 197-pound redshirt college sophomore from Hoover, Ala.\n\nConlon doesn’t compare himself to the 16-year-old main character, created in the 1951 classic novel by J.D. Salinger, who dealt with the reality of adulthood in a much grimier era in New York City.\n\nAnd of course, Hofstra is located 30 miles from the City on Long Island, where wrestlers can find a beach on the Atlantic Ocean as fast as they can find a much busier life in New York City.\n\n“It’s actually more of a suburban area and what I’m used to,” said Conlon, who grew up outside of Birmingham, and does find time to enjoy today’s New York City. “My coach probably doesn’t want me to say this, but there are times I go to the City to eat and eat too much.”\n\nBut Conlon, a 2023 Alabama state high school champion, does believe “100 percent” that the book’s message is helping him adapt to NCAA Division I wrestling.\n\n“(The book) had a big impact on me,” he said. “I’m due to go back through that book because there are many lessons to have been learned from it.”\n\nConlon simply calls his college wrestling career “challenging.” That included a true freshman season in 2023-24 when he went 9-15 at 184 pounds and a redshirt year last season that saw him beat two eventual national qualifiers before undergoing surgery in March to repair an ACL injury.\n\nHe returned this season much healthier and has compiled a 14-9 record through Feb. 1. Though he is not ranked, Conlon considers himself and other Hofstra teammates — like fellow redshirt sophomore Jake Slotnick, 16-11 at 165 pounds — as diamonds in the rough.\n\n“In high school and middle school when I started wrestling, I’ve felt like I’ve been looked over at times,” said Conlon, who also won an NHSCA national championship before coming to Hofstra.\n\n“For me, it’s about chipping away against the top guys in my weight class and trying to close the gap. Consistency is what’s going to get me there. The biggest aspect of my training since high school is where I’ve made myself consistent with training and doing what it takes to get better.\n\n“I’m really thankful for the coaching staff that I have now and who took a chance on me.”\n\nHofstra coach Jamie Franco, the former Pride alum who was a three-time NCAA qualifier (2012-14), believes Hofstra can return to the days when the EIWA school finished as high as seventh in the nation in 2007, but has not had an All-American since 2018 when heavyweight Michael Hughes finished sixth.\n\n“We are a young team,” said Franco, now in his second year. “We just need some experience. Fortunately, most of this team has one or two years of eligibility left.”\n\nFranco — who was introduced to the Alabama native from Conlon’s club coach, Shad Rissler, also a New York native and former prep teammate of Franco —believes that Conlon can be one of his team’s leaders.\n\n“I think he’s a better version of himself and we see each week he’s getting a little stronger,” said Franco. “We hope over the next month before the conference tournament that he keeps building and realizes how well he is doing.”\n\nWill, the son of Carol and Joshua (a former high school wrestler) Conlon, has tried to share his challenge with friends and family back home in Alabama.\n\n“I tell them what’s going on, but if I wasn’t myself, I don’t think I’d truly understand what this has been all about,” he admitted. “It’s a different beast. You have to wake up early, go to workouts and team practices and classes and then go through the competition aspect of it. Every time you compete, a guy is looking to rip your head off, and you have to be willing to do the same thing.”\n\nConlon also credits the Hofstra brotherhood in helping me adapt to his college environment and wrestling goals.\n\n“I just moved off campus this past semester into a house with six other guys and teammates. I consider all those guys my brothers,” he said. “That’s what was important for me when I came here on my visit. I felt like I was home with my family. The summer before my freshman year, I came into training with a team and felt connected with that group.”\n\nBut Conlon also believes he must take his own responsibility to reach his wrestling goals.\n\n“There is something I learned since being in college: you have to seek out the answers to what your development is going to look like and how you are going to get to the next level,” he said. “At this level, you can’t just come in and work on your two best shots of two best re-attacks, work on top and bottom and simply achieve what you want to achieve.\n\n“I feel like you have to be a fan of the sport and be watching the guys who are constantly innovating in the sport and adopting some of those habits and training methods of the best wrestlers. I think some guys don’t realize they also have to be innovators and be as much of a spectator as a competitor.”\n\nA management major, who has been on Hofstra’s Dean List in the past two years, does believe he is reaching his overall life’s goals the past three years.\n\n“Before wrestling was in the cards, which happened late in my high school career, I was thinking about going to a state school near me like Auburn or Alabama,” he said. “And while that experience might have been good, I think taking a different step and direction to wrestle in college and in a completely unknown area, it’s definitely something that aligns with my goals, which is trying out next experiences that make up my life.”",

    "fullText": "Knicks cut ties with Jalen Brunson's struggling 6-foot-7 teammate via trade to Bulls originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlthough the Golden State Warriors’ trade for Kristaps Porzingis and the Washington Wizards’ trade for Anthony Davis (both completed on Wednesday night) will be the main topic of discussion heading into the final stretch of the trade season, it’s worth noting that the New York Knicks recently executed a deal of their own.\n\nThe 2024 Eastern Conference participants cut ties with Jalen Brunson's struggling 6-foot-7 forward via a trade to the Chicago Bulls after less than a full season.\n\n“The New York Knicks are trading Guerschon Yabusele to the Chicago Bulls for Dalen Terry,” ESPN’s Shams Charania reported early Thursday morning.\n\nYabusele has been one of the Knicks’ most disappointing contributors this season, regardless of position. Following an inspiring 2024-25 campaign with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2024-25 (he averaged 11.0 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, while shooting 50.1% from the field and 38.0% from deep), the Knicks felt comfortable taking a chance on him in free agency.\n\nIt’s clear now that New York’s decision backfired, as the former first-round pick was virtually unplayable for first-year head coach Mike Brown this year. Yabusele contributed only 2.7 points and 2.1 rebounds per game with the Knicks, connecting on 39.3% of his field goals and 29.4% from three-point land.\n\nTerry isn’t a high-level bench contributor, either, but it’s challenging to envision him being worse than Yabusele in New York.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors cut ties with Stephen Curry's 6-foot-9 fan-favorite teammate via trade to Raptors",

    "description": "Artemi Panarin’s run on Broadway is over. After seven memorable seasons with the New York Rangers, Panarin’s off to Hollywood",
    "fullText": "Artemi Panarin’s run on Broadway is over. After seven memorable seasons with the New York Rangers, Panarin’s off to Hollywood following a trade to the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nPanarin had 607 points (205 goals, 402 assists) in 482 regular-season games over seven seasons with the Rangers, and his 1.26 points-per-game average is best in franchise history. He ranks eighth all-time for the Rangers in assists, ninth in points, and 14th in goals.\n\nHe left behind a treasure trove of memorable highlights in New York, and will be remembered as one of the most exciting players ever to wear the Blueshirts sweater.\n\nLet’s break down the 10 greatest moments for Panarin during his tenure with the Rangers.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin and former Blue Jackets teammate Sergei Bobrovsky are dear friends, but the Breadman made his countryman — and star defenseman Aaron Ekblad — look silly when he dangled around both and snuck a back-hand shot past the Florida Panthers goalie for a highlight-reel goal in the first period in Sunrise, Florida.\n\nWhy it was great: Before arriving in New York, Panarin owned the Rangers, with 12 goals and 18 points in 12 career games. So it was a relief to see Panarin register his first three-goal game in a Blueshirts sweater in Game 31 of his first season. Panarin had an assist on Mika Zibanejad‘s power-play goal that tied the game, then sealed the hat trick with a pair of goals late in the third period of the Rangers’ 6-3 win over the San Jose Sharks.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin scored a career-high four goals against the Carolina Hurricanes, helping the Rangers turn a 2-1 second-period deficit into a 6-2 laugher. He also had an assist to record points on five of New York’s six goals.\n\nWhy it was great: Maybe the last memorable moment for Panarin in a Rangers sweater. With New York up 1-0 late in the first period, Panarin floated a seeing-eye shot past Bobrovsky in the outdoor contest played in Miami. It ended up being the game-winning goal, and Panarin also added an assist in the Rangers’ 5-1 win over the Panthers.\n\nWhy it was great: It’s easy to forget how far the Rangers had fallen and how quickly that drop off was after so much success for most of the 2010s. But the Letter 1.0, authored in February 2018 by then-GM Jeff Gorton and team president Glen Sather, ushered in a rebuild that climaxed earlier than expected when Panarin signed a mammoth seven-year, $81.5 million contract. The Rangers outbid the Islanders and Blues Jackets for his services, and Panarin was worth every penny. He led the Rangers in scoring six straight seasons before traded to the Kings, and the Blueshirts reached the Eastern Conference Final in 2022 and 2024, and won the Presidents’ Trophy in 2023-24 with Panarin a vital member of their core.\n\nWhen: Oct. 12, 2023-Nov. 18, 2023\n\nWhy it was great: The 2023-24 season was undoubtedly Panarin’s best ever, and he started it with a bang by setting the Rangers record for longest season-opening point streak. Panarin had 10 goals and 16 assists, and the Rangers were 12-2-1 in that stretch. That streak set New York on the path toward its Metropolitan Division championship and the franchise’s fourth Presidents’ Trophy. It also started Panarin on the way to 120 points, second most in Rangers history.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin often showed off his Rockettes-style leg kick after big goals, but it all started with this highlight-reel tally against the Detroit Red Wings early in 2020. Panarin dangled around Detroit defenseman Alex Biega then snuck a back-hand shot past Jimmy Howard to put the Rangers up 3-0. He sealed the goal with a kick, which became his signature celebration.\n\nWhy it was great: Playing outside at MetLife Stadium in front of a pro-Rangers crowd crowd of roughly 80,000, the Blueshirts fell behind 4-1 in the second period then trailed 5-3 in the late stages of the third period against the rival Islanders. Yet, Chris Kreider deflected Panarin’s point shot on the power play past Ilya Sorokin to make it 5-4. After Zibanejad tied it with another power-play tally, Panarin sent the Rangers fans into delirium by stealing Noah Dobson’s pass on the opening shift of overtime and beating Sorokin for an emotional 6-5 comeback win, though only after video review upheld his OT winner.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin scored the game-winning goal in Game 1 of the Rangers’ second-round playoff series against the Hurricanes, then had three assists in a 4-3 win in Game 2. But the Rangers coughed up a late 2-1 lead in Game 3 on the road when Andrei Svechnikov tied the score with the net empty at the other end. But Panarin’s hard work paid off early in OT, when he got inside position on Carolina’s Jalen Chatfield and redirected Vincent Trocheck‘s pass by Pyotr Kochetkov for the game-winning goal at 1:43 of the extra session, giving the Rangers a commanding 3-0 lead in the series. The Rangers ultimately claimed the series in six games.\n\nWhy it was great: It had been five years since the Rangers won a series in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and they looked destined for another early exit after losing a three-overtime classic in Game 1 and fell behind 3-1 to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the best-of-7 first round — especially after they allowed seven goals apiece in Games 3 and 4. But after the Rangers won Games 5 and 6, sending the series to MSG for Game 7, Panarin authored his signature Rangers moment, fittingly on the power play in overtime of the do-or-die game. He dusted off a pass from Adam Fox twice then wristed the game-winner through traffic and past Tristan Jarry, sending the Rangers to the second round.\n\nRangers trade Artemi Panarin to Kings for Liam Greentree, draft picks\n\nEx-Rangers captain Jacob Trouba throws shade, ‘having more fun’ in Anaheim\n\nRangers running out of time to trade Artemi Panarin before NHL roster freeze\n\nRangers coach provides brief Artemi Panarin update, waiting for trade",

    "description": "We're hiring! Join the Converge team in NYC and do your best work!",
    "fullText": "Help us build everything a consumer brand needs to grow. We’re just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). You’ll be shipping end-to-end product and working directly with customers.\n\nWe want to profitably grow the world's consumer brands. That begins with helping them understand which marketing efforts are driving profitable growth.\n\n200+ consumer brands, including publicly traded companies, rely on Converge to check in on their marketing performance up to a dozen times a day. They drill down to figure out what's working and decide where to shift million-dollar marketing budgets.\n\nTo ship even more, we've raised $5.7M from some of the best investors, including Y Combinator, General Catalyst, and the founders of Posthog, Algolia, Shipbob, ...\n\nShip product fully end-to-end. All the way from designing the system and data models to building out the interface and polishing the experience.\n\nWe trust you to build the best solution to a customer's problem. We lead with context and give you full autonomy to design the solution. This means you'll need to build a deep understanding of the problem, obsess over the solution, and ship it.\n\nWork directly with customers. You'll talk to them, ship, get feedback, and iterate. There are no middlemen. This means you can move incredibly fast: you message a customer, create a PR, and can have it fixed within hours.\n\nSome examples of projects you could own:\n\nEffortless Slack conversations: Customers screenshot their Converge reports up to a dozen of times a day (!) to share with the rest of the company. Instead, they should be able to directly tag and message a teammate from any number in Converge and have this synced bidirectionally with Slack.\n\nCentralizing all growth efforts: Converge already centralizes all growth metrics, but the information explaining them is still scattered. We want overlay the context that actually explains trends like pricing updates, budget changes, and promo calendars.\n\nCreative analytics: All growth teams use a separate tool to iterate on ad creatives, but they would want to run this workflow on Converge. We should build a Creative Analytics product on top of our data.\n\nAI agents: We never wanted to jump on the AI train for the sake of hype. But now that we have the foundations in place, there's huge leverage in building agents that can help growth teams understand their data and act on it more quickly.\n\nWe're a team of just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). Join us if you want to get rid of office politics and just take ownership to get a lot done.\n\nEven though you join early, this job comes with real engineering challenges. We process $4B in online orders annually, 20TB of data flows through Converge each month, and we've collected around 10B customer interactions to date.\n\nWhat you're shipping will actually get used. 50% of our customers use us daily (!), while this is only 13% for the average SaaS company. You will have an immediate impact.\n\nWe love working in-person. You'll like it here if you do too.\n\nIf you think you could be a founder, there's no better way to learn than to talk to customers and ship. That's what you'll be spending all of your time on. We obsess over the details and will share honest feedback.\n\nStrong experience working across the stack (4+ YOE). We work with React, Python, Postgres, and Clickhouse. Experience building data-intensive products or familiarity with Clickhouse is a plus.\n\nYou've previously built products or large features fully end-to-end.\n\nYou obsess over the quality of what you're building, both in UX and code.\n\nSalary: $175K - $240K + equity (0.6% - 0.85%).\n\nPrivate health, dental, and vision insurance.\n\nIntro call (30 min): We want to learn about your motivations to join Converge, determine why you’d be a great fit, and answer any questions you have for us.\n\nTechnical (1h): We work through a typical engineering problem we face at Converge.\n\nCulture (45 min): We dive into your past experiences to learn how you like to work and what motivates you.\n\nSuperday (1 day): Join us for a day to actually build something! You get to meet the team, we get to meet you, it's great. (fully paid)\n\n(*) This can all be done in 2 days. If you want to move quickly, we do too. Our founding engineer was on a plane to meet us just days after our first call.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON/NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Oil refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast are struggling to absorb a rapid surge in Venezuelan crude shipments since last month's flagship $2 billion supply deal between Caracas and Washington, pressuring prices and leaving some volumes unsold, according to traders and shipping data.\n\nWhat challenges are U.S. refiners facing with Venezuelan crude?\n\nHow might India's trade deal affect Venezuelan oil sales?\n\nWhat role do trading houses play in Venezuelan exports?\n\nHow has Venezuelan oil export volume changed recently?\n\nThe soft U.S. demand represents ​an early obstacle for President Donald Trump's hopes of sending the majority of the South American country's oil to the United States since U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro ‌last month in a raid in Caracas.\n\nTrading houses Vitol and Trafigura were granted U.S. licenses to market and sell millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil following the U.S. operation and a subsequent supply agreement with interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\nThe trading houses, ‌which joined energy major Chevron in holding approval to export Venezuelan oil, struck several early deals to sell some cargoes to refiners in the U.S. and Europe. However, with Chevron also raising exports quickly, the trading companies are now finding it harder to secure enough buyers among Gulf Coast refiners, traders said.\n\n\"We're all facing this issue where there's more to place and not enough takers,\" one of the traders said, citing reluctance from U.S. refiners to buy Venezuelan crude. Some refiners are complaining that prices, albeit declining, remain high compared to competing Canadian heavy grades.\n\nVenezuelan heavy oil cargoes for delivery at the Gulf Coast are being offered at ⁠about $9.50 per barrel below benchmark Brent, versus discounts of between $6 and $7.50 per ‌barrel in mid-January.\n\nLast month, total Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. almost tripled to 284,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data based on tanker movements.\n\nThe U.S. was absorbing some 500,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil before Washington imposed sanctions on the country in 2019. But exports to the U.S. went to zero in mid-2025 ‍after Trump revoked all licenses to trade and ship.\n\nReaching the U.S. refiners' maximum capacity again will require time, one of the traders said, in part because some facilities would require adjustments to process heavier oil.\n\nThe chief executive of refiner Phillips 66, Mark Lashier, said on Tuesday the company can process around 250,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude, but prices must be competitive for Venezuelan grades to displace other sources of heavy oil.\n\nChevron and Trafigura declined to comment. ​Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA and Vitol did not reply to requests for comment.",

Free groceries for everyone.\n\nTomorrow 12pm.\n\nWest Side Market | 84 3rd Ave. NYC pic.twitter.com/rsrunK5brt\n\nBut Polymarket says it's going even bigger, opening its own grocery store in the city next week — \"New York's first free grocery store\" — for a limited time.\n\n\"The Polymarket is fully stocked. No purchase required. We're open to all New Yorkers,\" the company said. \"Free groceries. Free markets. Built for the people who power New York. We'll see you at The Polymarket's grand opening next week.\"\n\nAfter months of planning, we're excited to announce 'The Polymarket' is coming to New York City.\n\nNew York's first free grocery store.\n\nWe signed the lease. And we donated $1 million to Food Bank For NYC — an organization that changes how our city responds to hunger. 🧵 pic.twitter.com/BGMCWUMz8n\n\nThe address has yet to be announced by the company, but Polymarket says the store will be open from Thursday, February 12 at noon until Sunday, February 15.\n\nThe prediction market also says it donated $1 million to Food Bank for New York City. A spokesperson for Food Bank for New York City confirmed the donation to Business Insider.\n\n\"The activation is the result of months of planning — from securing permits and building out a dedicated retail space to coordinating logistics and nonprofit partnerships — and represents a direct investment in the city where Polymarket was founded and scaled,\" reads a release from the prediction market platform.\n\nKalshi and Polymarket have exploded in popularity over the last year and a half, and the giveaways are likely to raise the companies' profiles and brand recognition even further.\n\nBoth prediction markets have moved to partner with media organizations. Polymarket partnered with the Golden Globes and Dow Jones, while Kalshi has struck deals with CNN and CNBC.\n\nPrediction markets have also faced greater scrutiny from lawmakers, especially after an anonymous Polymarket trader made hundreds of thousands of dollars off a well-timed bet on former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's political future, sparking concerns about insider trading.\n\nThat's led some prediction markets to push back, with Kalshi emphasizing that it has rules against insider trading and supports efforts to regulate the practice.\n\nUpdate, February 3, 2026 — This story has been updated to clarify Food Bank of New York's involvement with the Polymarket initiative.",

    "description": "I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, for a slower pace of life and lower costs. Although I found both of those things, I feel lonely in my new city.",
    "fullText": "After two years of living in New York City, I realized that, although I loved life in the Big Apple, I wasn't fond of the exorbitant cost of living.\n\nMy days in the city were busy — think last-minute Broadway tickets, venturing out to Brooklyn for my photojournalism class, and bottomless brunches that turned into all-day affairs. Still, I found that leaving my apartment was costly, and I knew I needed a change.\n\nSo, moving to Charlotte, North Carolina, seemed like a practical decision. My dad was an hour and a half away, the culture felt less cutthroat, and the cost of rent didn't make me cringe.\n\nAt first, the change was refreshing. I traded crowded subway cars for tree-lined streets and pricey rooftop bars for local breweries.\n\nI even went from paying $4,600 a month for a studio apartment in NYC to $2,489 for an updated one-bedroom apartment with tons of amenities.\n\nHowever, as I began settling into life in Charlotte, the slower pace that I craved began to feel isolating.\n\nOn paper, my job sounds exciting — telling people I'm a travel writer is an instant conversation starter. But behind the trips, Instagram-worthy pictures, and articles, most of my work happens alone.\n\nWorking for a small media company means I don't have coworkers, either. Aside from one weekly meeting with my boss, my days are quiet until I leave for my next work trip.\n\nLuckily, when I'm traveling on assignment, I'm rarely alone. From striking up conversations with crew members to befriending fellow travelers, I'm constantly meeting new people from all walks of life.\n\nThose interactions are among the most rewarding parts of my job, but they only happen a few days each month.\n\nPlus, I often leave these trips feeling drained, which makes it hard to put myself out there and build new friendships when I'm home in Charlotte.\n\nBack in New York, I already had established relationships, which meant I didn't feel like I was \"starting over\" whenever I returned from a trip.\n\nAnd although I've tried finding a community in Charlotte through networking events, friend-of-a-friend invitations, and coffee meet-ups, I realized that building genuine connections postgrad is a slow and painful process — especially when you don't have any built-in social circles from work.\n\nAlthough there's plenty to do in Charlotte, many of the events have started to feel familiar and repetitive, rather than exciting and new — especially after living in the city for over three years.\n\nAt times, I appreciate the quieter lifestyle. However, after a while, the coffee shops, breweries, and parks all seem to blur together.\n\nAlthough I was usually sitting at the same few bars in New York, I never knew what characters would stroll by outside, or what subway performers I'd see in transit.\n\nIn Charlotte, though, even small errands and walks with my dog feel mundane. The predictability of walking the same streets, seeing the same faces, and sitting in the same traffic on I-77 makes Charlotte feel a lot smaller than it is — and, at times, isolating.\n\nBuilding a life in North Carolina has taken longer than expected, and some days, the seemingly endless tapping of my lone keyboard amid the hum of my air purifier is deafening.\n\nHowever, I don't regret my decision to move here.\n\nMy partner and I can now afford a lifestyle that seemed out of reach in New York. We have space to entertain, and the lower cost of living means we can splurge on our hobbies, including our ever-growing Lego collection, traveling, or concert tickets.\n\nAnd although I haven't quite solved the loneliness part just yet, I'm trying to show up",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants have suffered another setback in their search for an offensive coordinator, as Davis Webb has opted to remain with the Denver Broncos in a promotion rather than join the team in East Rutherford.\n\nWebb, a former Giants third-round draft pick in 2017 who started one game for Big Blue in the 2022 season finale, interviewed for the vacant OC position under new head coach John Harbaugh.\n\nThe Giants requested the interview in late January, viewing Webb's rising reputation -- bolstered by his work developing quarterbacks like Russell Wilson and Bo Nix in Denver -- as a strong fit for guiding young signal-caller Jaxson Dart.\n\nHowever, on Monday, the Broncos promoted Webb from passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach to offensive coordinator, filling the vacancy created by the recent firing of Joe Lombardi following Denver's deep playoff run.\n\nSources: Denver’s passing game coordinator Davis Webb has reached agreement to become the Broncos’ offensive coordinator. Webb interviewed for three head coaching jobs during this hiring cycle, had other offensive coordinator opportunities, but opted to remain with the Broncos. pic.twitter.com/pYVZTJPNWD\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) February 2, 2026\n\nThis decision allows Webb to stay under head coach Sean Payton, another ex-Giant, where he has thrived since joining the staff in 2023 after retiring from playing.\n\nThe Giants had hoped to pair Harbaugh with Todd Monken, his former OC in Baltimore, but Monken took the Cleveland Browns head coaching job. The team has conducted virtual interviews with other candidates, including Jim Bob Cooter, Kliff Kingsbury, Brian Callahan, and Alex Tanney, with in-person meetings expected soon for finalists.\n\nWhile Webb's familiarity with the organization and his offensive acumen made him an intriguing option, his choice to accept the Broncos' promotion leaves the Giants continuing their pursuit of a proven play-caller to elevate the offense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Davis Webb won't become New York Giants' OC, opts to remain in Denver",

    "fullText": "New York City is taking aim at one of the biggest complaints from gig workers: Account deactivations.\n\nOn Friday, the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, or DCWP, said that Uber Eats would reinstate the accounts of as many as 10,000 people that were deactivated between December 2023 and September 2024.\n\nThe reactivations are part of a settlement under which Uber Eats, Fantuan, and HungryPanda will pay a cumulative $5.2 million over violations of New York City's minimum pay law for delivery workers. Some of that money will be paid out to roughly 49,000 delivery workers in New York City as damages, according to the DCWP.\n\nBoth the reinstatements and the payouts are meant to compensate workers after the apps either didn't pay workers or deactivated their accounts after customers cancelled their orders, according to the DCWP. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAffected workers should have their accounts automatically reactivated, a spokesperson for the DCWP told Business Insider. Delivery workers who don't get back on to the app but believe that their accounts were deactivated due to their cancellation rates should file a complaint with the Department, the spokesperson added.\n\nNew York City's settlement is the latest government effort to regulate deactivations among gig workers. Last year, Seattle implemented a law regulating how gig work apps deactivate workers' accounts. The law requires the app to provide 14 days of notice before a deactivation and says that a human must review the choice, for instance.\n\nThe settlement is also New York City's latest action related to gig workers since Mayor Zohran Mamdani took office one month ago. Since then, the city has warned delivery apps over their pay practices and started enforcing a law aimed at increasing delivery workers' earnings from tips.\n\nFor delivery workers on apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash, deactivations can pose a major threat to their earnings.\n\nThe delivery services often deactivate accounts with little warning or explanation, Business Insider has reported previously. As independent contractors, delivery workers don't have the same protections as full-time employees. All the while, gig workers can miss out on work and earnings.\n\nWhile some workers try to fight the deactivations, many apps require them to go through binding arbitration, which means that workers can't appeal the decision about their account.\n\nHave a tip?

Jackson case that overturned the federal right to an abortion.\n\nThe court has also been rocked by revelations about disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate about a case involving Idaho’s abortion ban, a battle over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nRoberts’ decision to impose NDAs came just weeks after the Times quoted from the confidential immunity memos, according to the Times.\n\nThe move comes as critics are calling for more transparency at the Supreme Court, which is facing record-low public trust as the conservative justices greenlight the vast majority of Trump’s policies.\n\nRoberts, however, went in the other direction and mandated more secrecy, not less.\n\nThe last time prior to 2024 that Supreme Court clerks were asked to sign a document agreeing to abide by the court’s confidentiality rules appears to have been in the late 1990s, after a former clerk published a tell-all book in 1998, according to the Times.\n\nThose documents, however, did not amount to legal NDAs, according to some of the clerks that signed them.\n\nThe switch to formal contracts is “a sign of the court’s own weakness” and the erosion of internal cohesion, Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor, told the Times.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks are among the franchises that have been linked to Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo on the trade market.\n\nIf the Knicks were to trade for the two-time MVP before the upcoming Feb. 5 trade deadline, there would be no excuse for New York to fall short of an NBA Finals appearance for the second consecutive season.\n\nAccording to a recent report from ESPN’s Brian Windhorst, it’s clear how New York feels about trading for Antetokounmpo this season.\n\n“The Knicks believe in this team,\" Windhorst said Monday. “They believed in this team last summer when Giannis was loosely available in those discussions. They didn't make an aggressive offer at the time to progress those talks.”\n\n“If they want to win a bidding war now, I think it's going to take a three or four-team trade where they take some of their players and get other assets for them, and then come back to the Bucks and make very strong offers. That is just not happening. They are not showing that aggression to get Giannis right now, and I think that's because they like this team.\"\n\nThe Knicks’ stance on potentially acquiring Antetokounmpo from Milwaukee wouldn’t have made sense a few weeks ago. After starting the year with a 23-9 record, the franchise lost nine of its next 11 games and appeared to be headed toward a complete meltdown.\n\nHowever, the Jalen Brunson-led Knicks have turned things around since then, winning six straight games, with five of them being double-digit victories.\n\nAlthough Antetokounmpo has the championship experience New York is missing, it’s understandable that the Knicks would want to roll with their current group and attempt to bring a title to New York in June.\n\nMore NBA: Lakers linked to trade for 'sleeper' $37.7 million Warriors guard",

    "fullText": "The House Committee on Education and Workforce has asked the University of Utah to schedule a briefing to discuss the school’s plans to take money from a New York-based private equity firm.\n\nThe committee, which has jurisdiction over federal education policy, is examining the growing trend of schools seeking institutional partners to capitalize their athletic departments. The group is assessing whether legislative action might be needed to address concerns about the downstream impact of these deals.\n\nColorado's Dempsey Goes From House Objector to China Scholar\n\nSports Tech Mergers Double in Value in 'Landmark Year'\n\nCollege Recruiting Costs Shrink as Football Powers Adapt to Portal\n\nIn a letter sent to Utah president Taylor Randall on Monday morning, a copy of which was viewed by Sportico, the committee requested that the school share information regarding the details and motives behind its potential partnership with Otro Capital, which its trustees greenlit in December.\n\n“While recognizing the escalating costs in collegiate athletics, including revenue share obligations under the House v. NCAA settlement, NIL-related expenses and coaching salaries, the committee seeks to better understand the university’s rationale for entering into this arrangement,” committee chair Tim Walberg (R—Mich.) and Burgess Owens (R—Utah), a former NFL and University of Miami player and chairman of the subcommittee on Higher Education Workforce Development, wrote in the letter. “The information and briefing requested will assist the committee in determining whether legislative action may be necessary to protect students, schools and the integrity of college athletics.”\n\nAs conversations between schools and institutional funds have grown more public, so too have concerns from lawmakers. Last month, on the verge of the College Football Playoff title game, Reps. Michael Baumgartner (R—Wash.) and Haley Stevens (D—Mich.) wrote a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker asking him to limit the emergence of PE deals that “threaten the integrity of university governance and the quality of college sports in ways that will have disastrous consequences for athletes, students and fans.”\n\nLocal state-level lawmakers in both Utah and Washington have proposed bills that would also make it harder to execute these deals.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce’s letter to Randall requests that the university share terms of the arrangement and answer three specific questions:\n\nWhat factors and considerations led the university to pursue this partnership, and why was this approach selected over other potential financing options?\n\nWhat steps is the university taking to maintain institutional control and to protect student-athlete welfare, including compliance with Title IX under this partnership structure?\n\nHow might this partnership affect student costs, particularly with respect to mandatory student fees that subsidize the athletic department, and are any changes to the fee structure anticipated following implementation?\n\nRepresentatives for Utah and its athletic department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe University of Utah trustees voted during their December meeting to allow Randall, athletic department Mark Harlan and others to finalize a deal with Otro. While it’s unclear if that final arrangement has been signed, the structure of the deal was openly discussed. Utah is spinning the Utes’ athletics revenue streams into a for-profit entity, and plans to sell an equity stake in that business.\n\nRandall played a prominent part in the formal 110-minute pitch to the trustees, helping explain the macro reasons why Utah is seeking the money, and why Otro Capital was the right partner.\n\nFinancial specifics, however, have been sparse. The school has declined to share details on a deal that likely tops nine figures. A Sportico open records request for any term sheet between the school and Otro, filed back in September, is yet to be fulfilled following multiple university extensions.\n\nUtah is not alone in seeking institutional money to adapt to the modern economics of college sports. The Big Ten, for example, was recently on the verge of a $2.4 billion partnership with a California pension fund, but those talks are now on hold after pushback from some conference members about the 20-year revenue share commitment that came with the deal.\n\nThe Big 12 is in advanced talks on a potential $500 million deal with Collegiate Athletic Solutions (CAS), a fund backed by RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital, that would let schools take upfront money in exchange for revenue sharing on the back end. That deal, unlike the proposals involving Utah and the Big Ten, does not involve any equity changing hands.\n\nSeparately, a number of other schools, such as Kentucky and Clemson, have created similar separate commercial entities, but they are yet to take outside institutional investment. Those deals are widely considered necessary step for public schools to take on institutional money for athletics.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce, which dates back to 1867, has 21 majority members, and 16 minority members. Under House Rule X, the committee is tasked with reviewing and coordinating “laws, programs and government activities relating to domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student assistance within the jurisdiction of other committees.”\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2025?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings\n\nEverything to Know About the 2025 Emirates NBA Cup",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets are going through the process of hiring their next offensive coordinator after Tanner Engstrand's shocking dismissal.\n\nAccording to multiple reports including ESPN, the Jets are down to three candidates. That list includes Greg Roman, Frank Reich, and Darrell Bevell.\n\nAll three candidates possess previous experience coordinating NFL offenses.\n\nJets Wire has ranked them from best to worst.\n\nGreg Roman spent the previous two campaigns coordinating the Los Angeles Chargers offense for Jim Harbaugh. He previously worked under John Harbaugh with the Baltimore Ravens and was key throughout Lamar Jackson's formative years. Roman failed to maximize Justin Herbert in L.A., but his track record is better than the alternatives.\n\nFrank Reich has been the overwhelming favorite to become Aaron Glenn's coordinator and play caller. Reich enjoyed a fairly successful stint as the Indianapolis Colts' head coach (2018-22), but the follow-up job he did with the Carolina Panthers was disastrous. A decision could arrive this week.\n\nDarrell Bevell was Pete Carroll's long-term offensive coordinator with the Seattle Seahawks. Since then, his reputation has taken a negative turn. Bevell coordinated a bad Detroit Lions offense in 2020 before becoming their interim head coach following Matt Patricia's midseason firing, and the same thing happened to him in 2021 in Jacksonville with Urban Meyer.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Ranking the Jets' 3 OC candidates from best to worst",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants face a critical wide receiver need heading into the offseason, as highlighted in Pro Football Focus' analysis of teams' biggest priorities for free agency and the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nPFF believes the Giants should focus on adding a receiver at No. 5 overall. Specifically, Ohio State wideout Carnell Tate.\n\nBiggest Need: Wide receiver Target: WR Carnell Tate, Ohio State\n\nMalik Nabers flashed star potential as a rookie in 2024, ranking eighth out of 133 qualifying wide receivers in PFF overall grade (86.7). He appeared in just four games this season before suffering a torn ACL, so we didn’t get an opportunity to see how he would develop with quarterback Jaxson Dart.\n\nBeyond Nabers, the Giants' wide receiver unit looks thin, especially since slot specialist Wan'Dale Robinson is heading into free agency and may not be back with the team. Sometimes overshadowed by Jeremiah Smith at Ohio State, Tate is a polished prospect in his own right after finishing fifth in the FBS with an 89.0 PFF receiving grade. He also did not drop a single pass across 66 targets this season.\n\nNabers' injury-shortened 2025 campaign underscores the urgency for depth and a reliable complement.\n\nTate, a 6-foot-3 OSU standout, offers elite reliability -- boasting a near-perfect drop rate and strong efficiency even while sharing targets with top talents. His high PFF grades and production (875 yards and nine touchdowns in 2025 despite missing time) position him as a potential top-10 pick, frequently mocked to the Giants at No. 5.\n\nTargeting Tate makes strategic sense to bolster Jaxson Dart's options and build around Nabers long-term. While the draft class is deep, passing on a polished, high-upside receiver like Tate could prolong the Giants' offensive struggles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Should New York Giants target WR Carnell Tate?",

    "fullText": "The New York Knicks spoiled what might have been LeBron James's last game at Madison Square Garden, stretching their win streak to six games with a 112-100 victory.\n\nOG Anunoby scored 25 points and reserve Landry Shamet added 23 to lead the Knicks.\n\nFour-time NBA Most Valuable Player James, a 41-year-old Lakers star, remains uncommitted beyond this season, his NBA-record 23rd. But he says playing at the Garden has meant \"everything\" to him.\n\n\"It's the Mecca of basketball in New York. It's the Big Apple. Being at MSG, so many guys have walked this court, basketball, entertainment, actors, musicians, everything. It has been a wide range of America, the people, to grace this floor,\" James said.\n\n\"I hope I'm like a small snippet of somebody that came through here and was able to make a little small dent from a visitor's perspective. It's always cool in here. I've always loved these fans.\"\n\nWhile not saying it was his Garden farewell, James noted, \"When the time comes it will always have a special place.\"\n\nJosh Hart added 20 points for the Knicks while All-Star guard Jalen Brunson had 12 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists.\n\n\"We've just been playing together,\" Brunson said of their win streak. \"Sticking together, that's the biggest part, having each other's back holding each other accountable.\n\n“We have to continue to do that. Can't be satisfied. It's a collective effort.\"\n\nThe Knicks improved to 31-18, second in the Eastern Conference behind Detroit.\n\nThe Lakers fell to 29-19 despite 30 points from Luka Doncic and 22 from James, who was named to his record 22nd NBA All-Star Game as a reserve by NBA coaches.\n\n\"Super humbling,\" James said. \"Mad respect to the coaches. \"Playing at the latter stages of my career and still able to be an All-Star, it means a lot.\"\n\nIt was the first Laker loss of the season after leading at half-time.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 34 points and added 13 assists while Cason Wallace had a career-high 27 points with seven three-pointers as reigning champions Oklahoma City won 121-111 at Denver.\n\n\"We knew we were going to have to bring it in this building if we wanted to get a W,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said.\n\nFrench star Victor Wembanyama delivered 25 points, eight rebounds, five blocked shots, four steals and two assists to ignite San Antonio's 112-103 home triumph over Orlando.\n\nThe game was pushed back to a night contest after the Spurs (33-16) had trouble flying out of snowstorm-hit Charlotte.\n\nCleveland's Jarrett Allen scored 40 points and grabbed 17 rebounds as the Cavaliers won 130-111 at Portland.\n\nDetroit claimed the most lopsided victory in team history as Jalen Duren scored 21 points while Cade Cunningham had 18 points and 12 assists in a 130-77 rout of visiting Brooklyn.\n\nSwedish guard Pelle Larsson and Bam Adebayo each scored 20 points as host Miami ripped Chicago 134-91, the third-biggest rout in Heat history.\n\nJaylen Brown had 30 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Boston Celtics over Milwaukee 107-79.\n\nRJ Barrett scored 21 points and Brandon Ingram added 19 for Toronto in a 107-100 home victory over Utah.

    "description": "Courtney Kinnare's art career has taken off since moving from LA to NYC. But in one of the most expensive cities in the world, it comes at a cost.",
    "fullText": "A couple of years out of college and in the midst of a pandemic, Courtney Kinnare took several big risks. The Californian quit her job in sustainable packaging design in Los Angeles, became a full-time artist, and moved to New York City.\n\n\"I just took the leap,\" said Kinnare, now 29. \"I was just like, if I go for it, I have no choice but to make it work out.\"\n\nShe wasn't totally prepared for what it would cost her. When Kinnare moved across the country in 2021, New York City rents began to rise as many others returned after the pandemic. Like many artists, she pays double rent — for her apartment and her studio — and her income swings dramatically, making it hard to budget.\n\nAt the same time, living in New York has turbocharged Kinnare's career. She's constantly meeting gallery owners, seeing new art, and getting exposure to new customers. But while her income has more than doubled in a few years, she often works seven days a week — and the money she makes doesn't go very far.\n\nKinnare is among a growing share of New Yorkers struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world, as the costs of necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that has driven up rents and home prices.\n\nNew York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, got elected on a pledge to bring these costs down, including for artists. In January, he promised to \"make New York affordable to make the arts,\" and said his administration would also make arts and culture more accessible for working-class people. He's facing a dismal trend. After years of growth in the creative industries, the city has lost a significant number of artists since the pandemic.\n\n\"I've always been able to figure it out,\" Kinnare said, but, \"every month I'm like, 'Okay, how am I making money this month?'\"\n\nWhen she first arrived in the city, Kinnare spent $2,000 on rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn that she also used as her art studio. Eventually, she moved in with two roommates and rented a separate studio, where she had more room to grow her craft.\n\nLast year, she moved in with her partner, and spends about $1,000 a month for her share of the $2,600 rent for their Bed-Stuy loft, and another $1,700 on her studio space in Dumbo.\n\nOver the last few years, she's steadily grown her art sales and income, which started around $50,000 a year when she first moved to the city, and last year exceeded $100,000. That's in part because one of her products — a $45 purse hook — took off late last year. She quickly sold out of her first 1,500 hooks, made of metal, glass, abalone shell, and mother-of-pearl, and designed to hang a bag from a restaurant table or bar. She recently dropped 2,000 more and hopes to make them a permanent part of her collection.\n\nDespite her recent windfall, budgeting is tricky with an income that varies dramatically month to month. \"I don't have family money to fall back on, or anyone to ask to borrow money from,\" she says.\n\nIt's taken a toll on Kinnare's social life, especially with friends who work corporate jobs and like to go out. She says she skips dinners out and has made a concerted effort to surround herself with other artists who understand the reality of having an unreliable income and the lifestyle that comes with it.\n\n\"Sometimes you blink your eyes and spend $100, and you're like, what just happened?\" she says. \"That's taken a lot of self-control to be able to find activities and things to do that don't require spending money.\"\n\nWhen factoring in the cost of living, New York creative workers like Kinnare earn about 23% less than the national average, a recent report by the nonprofit Center for an Urban Future found. A decade ago, they earned 15% less than the average. Much of that has to do with pricier real estate. With tighter living quarters in the city, many artists rent a separate studio space to work on their craft.\n\nFinding a studio space with enough room and natural light was even harder than finding an apartment, Kinnare says. When she was forced to move out of one studio on short notice, she struggled to find anything affordable on the market that had a window. So she resorted to messaging artists she didn't know on Instagram, asking for their landlords' contact information. \"It's a really, really fast game, and you have to be on top of it,\" she said.\n\nKinnare sees the high cost of living in New York City as an investment in her career that, so far, is paying off. She thinks it's easier to break into the art world than it was in LA, where she felt more professionally isolated.\n\n\"The art scene here is a lot more diverse and approachable,\" she said. \"I'm frequenting galleries a lot more, going to openings, going to shows, being in places where I want to be, networking and seeing and having the chance to talk to some of these people.\"\n\n\"The exposure here has been tenfold compared to what I've been used to,\" she added.\n\nLast year, she signed with a gallery after meeting their owners at a design fair and has since shown her work at multiple fairs with them.\n\nStill, the costs of breaking into the most dynamic creative scene in the country are high — and a growing number of creatives aren't making it. Many artists who left New York when COVID hit haven't returned. The number of New Yorkers working in the creative economy, including self-employed people, has dropped by about 6% since 2019, the Center for an Urban Future found. The city has lost nearly one-fifth of its dancers and film and video editors. More than a quarter of its fashion designers have disappeared.\n\nKinnare feels like one of the lucky ones. Her sales and social media following are growing, and she finally has some savings. One of her goals for 2026 is to give herself one day a week when she doesn't open her laptop or step inside the studio.\n\n\"I feel like I'm finally, after four years, at a place where I can breathe a little bit, but the grind never stops,\" she says. \"You can never get too comfortable.\"",

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees reportedly “checked in” on Dodgers free agent Michael Kopech this offseason, per the New York Post’s Jon Heyman.\n\nKopech entered free agency after spending a majority of 2025 on the injured list with the Dodgers. The reliever began the regular season on the injured list with a shoulder injury and transferred to the 60-day injured list at the beginning of May 2025.\n\nHe returned to the team the following month, but returned to the injured shortly after with a right knee injury. Kopech returned once again at the beginning of September, but re-aggravated his knee injury at the end of the season and missed the postseason.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Sign Brother of Current LA Starter to Minor League Deal\n\nThe right-hander joined the Dodgers at the trade deadline in 2024, switching to the National League from the Chicago White Sox.\n\nThe 29-year-old made an instant impact after arriving with the Dodgers, and became one of their most important weapons out of the bullpen. He had a 1.13 ERA with L.A. in 2024, and maintained a 3.00 ERA during their World Series charge in the playoffs.\n\nEven though he struggled with injury last season, the right-hander still performed will in 2025. He had a 2.45 ERA through 14 appearances with the Dodgers last season.\n\nThe Dodgers have already reinforced their bullpen this offseason so re-signing Kopech is unlikely, but whichever team grabs him will get a high-quality reliever for the upcoming season.\n\nThe post Dodgers World Series Champion Linked to Yankees appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "The WNBA and members of the WNBA Players Association will meet in New York on Monday to discuss the stalled collective bargaining negotiations, Kelsey Plum said on Friday after Unrivaled shootaround.",
    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA — The WNBA and members of the WNBA Players Association will meet in New York on Monday to discuss the stalled collective bargaining negotiations, Kelsey Plum said on Friday after Unrivaled shootaround.\n\nThe meeting will include members of the players union, the league’s CBA leadership, the legal team, members of the Labor Relations Committee and potentially other owners, a league source with knowledge of the discussions told Yahoo Sports, confirming the meeting.\n\nPlum said she and Naphessa Collier will attend since they can fly out after their early Unrivaled games on Sunday in Miami. Plum and Collier, who co-founded the offseason 3x3 league with Breanna Stewart, are both WNBPA vice presidents.\n\nIt is believed to be the first in-person meeting since shortly after the WNBA Finals concluded in October and the initial CBA deadline passed on Oct. 31. The league had reached out to the union for a couple of weeks now to put a meeting on the books, a source with knowledge of the talks told Yahoo Sports. Those requests were either ignored or declined until Thursday, the source said. Plum said to her knowledge, the meeting came together in recent days.\n\n“At the end of the day we’re human beings,” Plum said. “I think conversation face-to-face goes a long way, right? And you can understand body language, you can understand tone, you can understand all those type of things. And intent. And I just believe that eye contact is actually a massive thing that we forget.”\n\nPlayers, including Stewart, have said of late that they wanted such a meeting instead of working through lawyers. The league is proposing a revenue-sharing structure based on net revenue, whereas the union is proposing one based on gross revenue. There have been no new proposals in the new year after the latest extension expired on Jan. 9. A league source said the union submitted a proposal on Christmas Day that received no response, because it was essentially unchanged from the prior submission.\n\nNegotiations are continuing in a status quo period, with a moratorium passed on free agency to delay the massive movement expected when all but two of the veterans are unsigned. The league announced its 2026 schedule last week as talks hit the 15-month mark.\n\n“The thing is just sitting down and understanding the relationship and conversation, I think is No. 1, because let's be real, like when we play telephone with people in our own lives, a lot of times things can get scattered,” Plum said. “To be able to sit down face to face and say, ‘This is how I feel, this is how you feel, let's see what we can go from there.’”\n\nUnrivaled held practices in Philadelphia on Thursday ahead of the league’s first set of games outside of Miami. Players made available largely skirted away from CBA conversations, saying they’re focused on what they’re doing at Unrivaled or riding the line that they're unified as a player group. Tiffany Hayes said WNBPA executive director Terri Jackson met with players in Miami last week as they move toward the 100-days-out mark for the season to start on time on May 8.\n\nLexie Hull, a union representative for the Indiana Fever, said there is pressure as the timeline dwindles and media coverage increases over the lack of a deal.\n\n“People want a season,” Hull told reporters on Thursday. “We want a season. The league wants a season. And so that becomes just a much larger conversation. And I think that's what makes it feel like there's more pressure.”\n\nMessaging from the union has taken two tacks over the last year. Statements from the union and some players have followed hard, stern lines, with Satou Sabally calling an early proposal from the league a “slap in the face.” Others have been more nuanced and direct, describing small blips of progress, the need for compromise and a deal that benefits all.\n\nThat lack of unified messaging showed itself again on Friday, indicating schisms among the player base as they face a critical juncture.\n\nMinutes after Plum voiced optimism for an in-person meeting and exited the room in the halls of Xfinity Mobile Arena at the end of her media availability, Philadelphia native Natasha Cloud gave a much more fiery and animated retort, telling the crush of local TV media she was “disgusted with the W and how they’re handling this, and their lack of value, their lack of worth for us, their lack of even trying to attempt to move things with us.”\n\n“We will not f****** move until y'all move,” Cloud said, speaking directly into the closest camera. “And it would be the worst business decision of any business to not literally pay the players that make your business go. Without us, there is no W season. So the pressure is on the WNBA, on [Commissioner] Cathy [Engelbert], on [NBA Commissioner] Adam [Silver], on everyone that is in that front office. Do your job. Negotiate and pay your players, your workers.”\n\nAzurà Stevens, the Los Angeles Sparks player rep, spoke similarly, calling for new WNBA leadership and making clear she’s been preparing for a strike. She said she was not aware of an in-person meeting on Monday.\n\n“I feel like this is ridiculous that we’re waiting this long anyways,” Stevens said. “I just think this all needs to be over. We need to come to something and we either need to play or we don’t. It’s getting dragged out, and it’s honestly just frustrating at this point.”",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A man who drove his car into the Chabad Lubavitch world headquarters in New York City had recently been trying to connect with the Hasidic Jewish community and was recorded on video enthusiastically dancing with congregants during a recent visit to the site, police said.\n\nInvestigators were still trying to piece together what prompted the man, Dan Sohail, 36, to ram his car repeatedly into a set of doors at the revered Hasidic Jewish center in Brooklyn on Wednesday night, but police charged him Thursday with attempted assault as a hate crime, based on the fact that the building was a Jewish institution.\n\n“Earlier this month, Sohail attended a social gathering at this very same location,” New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said at a news conference, noting there was video circulating online of that gathering.\n\nThe video appears to show Sohail dancing with Orthodox men inside the headquarters.\n\n“We believe that he was in Brooklyn last night to continue this attempt to connect with the Lubavitch Jewish community,\" Kenny said.\n\nSohail told police that he lost control of his car because he was wearing “clunky boots,” Kenny said, though Kenny added that Sohail had removed several blockades and cleared snow away from a sidewalk before driving into the building.\n\nThe complex at 770 Eastern Parkway includes a synagogue and offices, and was packed with worshippers at the time, but no one was injured. Some of the building’s doors were damaged. No weapons were discovered in Sohail’s car.\n\nSohail's father told the New York Daily News Thursday that his son had been considering converting to Judaism and that he had struggled with “mental problems.” The Forward, a media outlet centered on Jewish issues, interviewed a rabbi in New Jersey who said Sohail attended a Purim service at Chabad last year and visited two other times, looking for spiritual guidance.\n\n“I was able to talk to him for a few minutes and see that he’s not exactly stable,” Rabbi Levi Azimov told the Forward. Another rabbi at a Jewish school in Carteret, New Jersey, where Sohail lived, told the Forward he had dropped by for afternoon prayers on Tuesday but began yelling about feeling let down by Chabad after the service.\n\nThe crash occurred on the 75th anniversary of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson becoming the leader of the Lubavitch movement and prompted immediate concern in the city. Mayor Zohran Mamdani and the city's police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, rushed to the scene to brief the media, with officials announcing increased security around houses of worship across the city.\n\n“This is deeply alarming, especially given the deep meaning and the history of the institution to so many in New York and around the world,\" Mamdani said. “And on today of all days.”\n\nThe Chabad Lubavitch headquarters and synagogue in Brooklyn draws thousands of visitors each year. There is a near constant police presence around the complex.",

She started all 36 games for the Wildcats last season in its Sweet Sixteen run, averaging over eight points per game and shooting 40.2%.\n\nThe Big 12 foes clashed back and forth throughout the first half, with neither team ever pulling away. Colorado led by just four at the end of the second quarter.\n\nThe Buffaloes looked to finally pull ahead with 5:38 left in the third off a Jade Masogayo three-pointer to lead by eight. However, the ‘Cats clawed back and kept it within four with ten to go.\n\nK-State looked to gain some momentum in the fourth quarter. A Brandie Harrod and-one gave K-State a three-point advantage with 7:33 to go.\n\nTied with under six remaining, Walker nailed a three-pointer to take back the lead for the Buffaloes. Colorado never looked back and extended its lead to nine by the final buzzer.\n\nColorado defeats the Wildcats 56-47.\n\nFreshman guard Jordan Speiser came off the bench and led the Wildcats in scoring with 12, including going 8-8 from the free-throw line. Senior guard Tess Heal missed her second game for the Wildcats, as she still awaits word from the NCAA regarding her violation.\n\nThe game extends K-State’s skid to two after losing to rival KU 83-61 in Lawrence Sunday.\n\nThe Wildcats look to get back above .500 in Tempe, Arizona, this Sunday against the Arizona State Sun Devils.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees and Paul Goldschmidt haven't figured out his free agency yet.\n\nBut they're still trying to line something up, and the latest updates are positive.\n\nThe New York Post's Jon Heyman reported this on Thursday:\n\n\"Paul Goldschmidt seems willing to return to the Yankees, even as something less than a full-time player. The Yankees are over the top tax threshold now, so they’d have to squeeze Goldy into the payroll. Goldschmidt makes sense since the Yankees still aren’t sold on Jasson Domínguez batting right-handed and Goldy is better defensively at 1B than Ben Rice.\"\n\nMORE: How Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nGoldschmidt seems willing to be just the short-side platoon guy that plays first base against left-handed pitching.\n\nIf he's really willing to do that, the Yanks should go after him.\n\nGoldschmidt played for the Yankees in 2025 for the first time. He turned 38 years old in September.\n\nGoldschmidt is a seven-time All Star and a former MVP.\n\nIn his career, he's a .288 hitter with an .884 OPS and 372 home runs.\n\nMORE: Paul Skenes has added a new pitch\n\nGoldschmidt signed with the Yankees on a one-year, $12.5 million deal before the 2025 season.\n\nFor the Yanks, Goldy batted .274 with a .731 OPS. Just against lefties, though, his OPS was .981.\n\nThat'll definitely work if the Yankees could get production like that out of Goldy one more time.\n\nTeam USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nHow Trent Grisham's decision ruined the Yankees' offseason plans\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nBo Bichette comments exhibit clear hyprocrisy\n\nAndrew McCutchen is not happy with the Pirates",

    "fullText": "A powerful coastal storm is expected to develop this weekend, and forecasters say its track will determine whether New York City sees accumulating snow or largely avoids impacts, with confidence highest for a system forming off the Carolinas.\n\nFOX 5 NY Meteorologist Mike Woods warns a slight shift closer to the coast could bring a major nor’easter, while a farther-offshore track would limit snowfall for much of the tri-state area.\n\nThe storm could rapidly strengthen into a bomb cyclone, a rare intensification process that can produce heavy snow, damaging winds and dangerous travel conditions as Arctic air remains locked over the Northeast.\n\nNEW YORK CITY - More winter weather may be on the way as forecasters track a potential weekend snowstorm that could strengthen into a major nor’easter.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) says confidence is growing that a powerful coastal storm will develop late this week, with the potential to bring snow, strong winds and bitter cold to the New York City area.\n\nSKIP TO: PREDICTIONS | FORECAST | BOMB CYCLONE | 5 DAY | LIVE WEATHER\n\nHowever, small changes in the storm’s track could make a big difference in who sees accumulating snow — and how much. Here's the latest on the storm.\n\nFOX 5 NY Meteorologist Mike Woods says the region needs to watch the storm closely.\n\nStay connected with FOX LOCAL.

More uncertainty remains for areas north along the East Coast. Stay tuned for more updates! pic.twitter.com/KT1UiNH6Dy\n\n— NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) January 28, 2026\n\nWith a cold weather advisory in effect due to Arctic air already locked in place, conditions could support snow across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.\n\nFOX 5 NY's meteorologist Mike Woods says the region needs to watch the storm closely.\n\n\"If it’s a little farther offshore, we’re left with less of an impact,\" Woods said. \"But if it’s a little closer to us, we could have a major nor’easter on our hands.\"\n\nWoods says some forecast models currently show snow reaching parts of the tri-state area, particularly the Jersey Shore and the eastern end of Long Island, late Saturday into Sunday.\n\nOther scenarios keep the storm farther offshore, limiting impacts for the city. Forecasters emphasize that the exact track of the storm remains uncertain. Even a shift of 50 to 100 miles could change precipitation types, snowfall totals or whether some areas see little to no snow at all.\n\nForecast guidance suggests snow could begin as early as Friday night in parts of the Southeast before spreading north.\n\nThe setup includes very cold air already in place across the Northeast, combined with a developing coastal storm that could pull moisture northward. Woods notes that temperatures will trend colder over the next several days, not warmer.\n\n\"We’ve got more shots of Arctic air coming through,\" he said. \"That’s why temperatures are actually going down instead of up.\"\n\nWind chill advisories are already in effect across parts of the region, with feels-like temperatures dipping below zero in some areas.\n\nFOX Weather says the developing storm has a strong likelihood of rapidly intensifying, a process known as \"bombing out,\" which could turn it into a bomb cyclone. Forecast models suggest the storm’s central pressure could drop dramatically as it moves offshore, a sign of rapid strengthening.\n\nHowever, where that intensification occurs remains uncertain. Meteorologists stress that the storm is still several days away, and multiple scenarios remain on the table.\n\nA bomb cyclone forms through a process called bombogenesis, which occurs when a storm’s central pressure drops at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, according to FOX Weather.\n\nForecasters say a pronounced dip in the jet stream is reinforcing cold air across much of the eastern United States while steering the storm farther south before it turns north.\n\nA strong upper-level disturbance is expected to become embedded in the jet stream late this week, helping trigger the development of low pressure off the East Coast.\n\nWith cold air already in place, that combination raises the risk for snow if the storm moves close enough to the region.\n\nMeteorologists say updates over the next several days will be critical in determining the storm’s impact on New York City and the surrounding area.\n\nThe biggest question remains the storm’s path after it moves through the Carolinas, with forecast models split on whether it will track far enough north to bring another weekend snow to the Northeast.\n\nWednesday: Bitterly cold but dry. Arctic air remains in place with sunshine and strong wind chills making it feel well below freezing across the tri-state area.\n\nThursday: Continued cold with increasing clouds. No precipitation expected, but the cold air sets the stage for potential weekend impacts.\n\nFriday: Clouds increase as a coastal storm begins to organize off the Southeast coast. Snow develops across parts of the Carolinas and southern Virginia by Friday night. Conditions remain cold locally with precipitation still uncertain for NYC.\n\nSaturday: Storm system moves north along the East Coast. Snow is possible in parts of New Jersey, Long Island and coastal areas, depending on the storm’s track. New York City remains in a \"wait-and-see\" zone.\n\nSunday: Potential for lingering snow, wind and cold if the storm tracks closer to the coast. A farther offshore track would limit impacts, while a closer path could bring a nor’easter with strong winds and accumulating snow.\n\nStay ahead of the snow with FOX 5’s expert meteorologists, streaming LIVE on FOX LOCAL.

In nine games, he threw for 1,259 yards and only 7 touchdowns.\n\nNew York will likely be looking for a new starting quarterback this offseason, and CBS Sports NFL writer Joel Corry thinks the Jets could move Fields this offseason.\n\n“The Jets signed Fields to a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million fully guaranteed as an unrestricted free agent last March in the hopes that he would be more than a bridge quarterback,” Corry wrote on Wednesday. “Fields’ preseason struggles were dismissed rather than seen as a warning sign after he played well against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular season opener.\n\n“It was downhill for the 2021 first-round pick after the Steelers game. Fields had a dubious distinction in a Week 6 loss to the Broncos. He was sacked nine times in producing a franchise-worst minus-10 net passing yards. Fields was benched nine games into the season.”\n\nThere’s a possibility that the Steelers could reunite with Fields this offseason, especially if Aaron Rodgers doesn’t come back.

    "description": "After college, my partner and I moved to New York City to live together and start our careers. I had no idea how much I'd miss living with my friends.",
    "fullText": "I still remember pulling out of the driveway of the house I'd shared with the same five girls for three years.\n\nI sat in the passenger seat, waving goodbye as my boyfriend drove away. We both cried, unable to fathom that college was really over.\n\nAs we road-tripped from Ann Arbor, Michigan, back to the Northeast (where we're both from), we felt excited for the next chapter of our lives — starting our careers in New York City and moving in together. But we were also going through our own forms of a breakup, just not with each other.\n\nMy housemates and I weren't just housemates. We were pandemic-era housemates, meaning we ate breakfast together at our tiny kitchen table every morning and took our remote classes from the same living room couch.\n\nMy boyfriend had a similar experience, living with friends in a house around the corner from mine.\n\nSomewhere along the way, both of our friend groups became like family, barging into each other's houses without notice and spending endless hours together.\n\nI had no idea just how much I'd miss that.\n\nJust one month after graduation, I had a cute, albeit tiny, apartment in Manhattan with swanky restaurants on each corner, a pickleball court nearby, and 24/7 access to pizza and bagels. And I was doing it all with my boyfriend by my side.\n\nI had achieved the dream so many Long Island-raised kids like myself had growing up.\n\nBut as much as I tried to romanticize my compact kitchen appliances and lack of windows (and consequently, sunlight), I longed for sunny days on my front porch in Ann Arbor with my five best friends sipping lattes out of mason jars, talking about absolutely nothing.\n\nMy boyfriend missed his version of this, too, sipping bottles of beer with his five housemates, talking mostly about football.\n\nWe both longed to be somewhere else. And I, for one, felt guilty.\n\nStruggling to adjust to our 9-to-5 schedules in a new city, we often found ourselves sitting around the apartment, lacking the energy to do all the fun things we used to love.\n\nI did make some new friends, but I struggled to put in the effort to maintain them. I often wondered if it was even possible to find the same level of friendship I had with my college housemates.\n\nI'd replay the highlight reel of memories in my mind — prank wars that would last for weeks, communicating with our next-door neighbors via handwritten signs taped to our windows, and nights in watching old One Direction music videos.\n\nAlthough we still kept in touch via our group chat, it just wasn't the same as waking up every morning to all my favorite people in one place.\n\nIt was as if I'd been living in my very own sitcom for three years — one that could never be recreated — with the perfect mix of characters, all in the right place at the right time.\n\nAnd like all sitcoms, it had to come to an end. I was holding out hope for a spinoff, but I had to let go.\n\nI realized that what I really needed most was time. There wasn't one thing in particular that magically made me stop missing my friends so much. It took about a year to adapt to my new routine and start feeling like myself again.\n\nIn the meantime, I let myself be sad, and I stopped feeling guilty about it. I leaned on the one person who understood my sadness on a personal level: my boyfriend.\n\nWe talked about missing our best friends, Ann Arbor, and our life together before we moved to New York City. It felt good to have someone who was going through the same thing.\n\nSlowly but surely, we adjusted to our new reality and started finding joy in the little things, like decorating our apartment, trying new bagel spots, and perfecting homemade vodka sauce.\n\nAs for my housemates, we continue to find unique ways to stay in touch. We partake in our own Secret Santa each year. We email each other life updates through personalized newsletters that are way too detailed. We schedule visits throughout the year and meet up around the country. Every time we do, it's like we're back home.\n\nOf course, I still miss them. But I've learned to cherish the people that are nearby — both new friends I've met in the city and old ones I grew up with back on Long Island. I've also made more of an effort to spend time with family. Thankfully, they're only a train ride away.\n\nTwo and a half years postgrad, my boyfriend and I still live together, but now we have a new apartment with a full-sized oven and more windows to let in plenty of sunlight.\n\nWe see our best friends a few times a year and spend the remaining 300-and-something days trying to convince them all to move to New York. And in the meantime, we've built a life we're happy with.",

    "description": ", Jonathan Landay and Matt Spetalnick NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence reports have raised doubts about whether interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez will cooperate",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence reports have raised doubts about whether interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez will cooperate with the Trump administration by formally cutting ties with U.S. adversaries, four people familiar with the reports said in recent days.\n\nU.S. officials have ​said publicly they want the interim president to sever relations with close international allies like Iran, China and Russia, including expelling their diplomats and advisers from Venezuela.\n\nBut ‌Rodriguez, whose swearing-in ceremony was attended by representatives of those countries early this month, has yet to publicly announce such a move. She became president after the U.S. captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3.\n\nThe ‌U.S. intelligence reports said it was not clear if she is fully on board with the U.S. strategy in her country, according to the sources, who declined to be identified by name.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe traveled on January 15 to Caracas, where he discussed the country's political future with Rodriguez. Reuters could not determine if those conversations changed the intelligence agencies' opinion.\n\nWashington wants to rein in its foes' influence in the Western hemisphere, including in Venezuela, where Trump seeks to exploit the OPEC nation’s vast oil reserves.\n\nIf Rodriguez were to break ties with the U.S. rivals, ⁠it would open more opportunity for U.S. investment in Venezuela’s ‌energy sector. But failure to control Rodriguez could undercut Washington’s efforts to direct the country’s interim rulers from afar and avoid a deeper U.S. military role.\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency and the Venezuela government did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAsked for comment, a senior Trump administration official, who ‍declined to be identified, said U.S. President Donald Trump \"continues to exert maximum leverage\" over Venezuela's leaders and \"expects this cooperation to continue.\"\n\nThe CIA has previously assessed that officials loyal to Maduro, including Rodriguez, were best positioned to govern the country following his ouster.\n\nBut critics of Trump's Venezuela strategy have expressed doubts about the wisdom of keeping Maduro's loyalists in place as the country's interim leaders. The concerns ​about Rodriguez' reliability were present prior to the U.S. military operation, said two sources.\n\nFor Venezuela, the U.S. directive means abandoning its closest allies outside the region. Iran has ‌helped Venezuela repair oil refineries while China has taken oil as repayment for debt. Russia has supplied weaponry, including missiles, to Venezuela's military.\n\nTrump has also cited communist-led Cuba as another U.S. foe he wants Venezuela to abandon. Havana has provided security and intelligence support while receiving cut-rate Venezuelan oil.\n\nSince Maduro's removal, Rodriguez, whose deep ties to the oil sector are crucial to keeping the country stable, has taken steps to stay in favor with Washington including releasing political prisoners and authorizing the sale of 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States.\n\nIn a speech on Sunday, Rodriguez said she has had “enough” of U.S. intervention. Still, U.S. officials have also held positive calls with her in recent days, according ⁠to two of the sources.\n\nThe Trump administration does not see an immediate alternative to working with Rodriguez, ​given it has publicly backed her so strongly, two of the sources said.\n\nBut U.S. officials are developing ​contacts with senior military and security officials in case they decide to change their approach, a source briefed on Venezuela policy said.\n\nMACHADO CONSIDERED A LONGER-TERM OPTION TO RUN VENEZUELA\n\nThe recent intelligence reports also found that opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is not currently able to run the country successfully ‍in part because she lacks strong ties to ⁠the country’s security services or oil sector, the sources said.\n\nSome observers and Machado's movement say it won a 2024 election that year by a huge margin, though the state backed a Maduro victory. She remains popular with Venezuelans.\n\nTrump told reporters last week he wanted Machado “involved” in the country’s leadership, without providing details.\n\nOne person familiar with ⁠the administration’s discussions with Machado said she is well-liked by the White House and is considered a longer-term option for a leadership position in Venezuela.\n\nThe separate source briefed on Venezuela policy suggested that for now, Machado ‌could be considered for an advisory role but no firm decision had been made. Representatives for Machado did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Erin Banco, Jonathan Landay and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Don Durfee and Cynthia Osterman)",

    "description": "A WFAN host argues that the New York Giants should sign WR Odell Beckham Jr., reuniting him with head coach John Harbaugh.",
    "fullText": "Following the New York Giants' hiring of John Harbaugh, the top head coaching candidate on the market, excitement surrounds the changes the Giants will make this offseason.\n\nHarbaugh has already begun overhauling the coaching staff, bringing in several coaches he previously worked with during his time with the Baltimore Ravens. With free agency approaching, many have speculated about Ravens free agents who could follow their former head coach to New York.\n\nThere may also be interest in targeting free agents who previously played for both the Giants and Harbaugh, such as Kevin Zeitler, Jihad Ward, or even former star receiver Odell Beckham Jr.\n\nWFAN's Tommy Lugauer believes a reunion with Beckham is something the Giants should explore.\n\nTommy calls for the Giants to bring back Odell Beckham Jr:@tommylugauer pic.twitter.com/i9TRz55iBu\n\n— WFAN Sports Radio (@WFAN660) January 27, 2026\n\n\"So here's my suggestion. A wide receiver that is no stranger to the Giants, a wide receiver that is no stranger to John Harbaugh. A wide receiver that has already had a conversation with Jaxson Dart about John Harbaugh,\" he said. \"And that man's name is Odell Beckham Jr. That's right. OBJ reuniting in New York in a different role than he had in his previous stop, where he was the number one wide receiver, the playmaker. Now as a grizzled vet, a guy that's won a championship, has been around the block -- a chance to come back home.\n\n\"A chance to reunite not only with the Giants but with John Harbaugh, and be a valued wide receiver and playmaker for young Jaxson Dart and a young Giants offense. So there's already a relationship with Harbaugh and OBJ. There's obviously a relationship with Beckham and the Giants. Many were sad when he was sent away, when he was traded off. Now here's the opportunity for the reunion. So Joe Schoen, John Harbaugh -- make it happen. Odell Beckham Jr. back with the Giants.\"\n\nA Beckham-Giants reunion has been discussed for years following the trade that sent the former first-round pick to the Cleveland Browns. Beckham was one of the franchise's most popular players in recent memory, and he has certainly shown interest in returning to the Giants before his career ends.\n\nAs much fun as the reunion may be, it is certainly questionable how much production Beckham could add as a playmaker at 33 years old.\n\nHe last played in 2024 with the Miami Dolphins, appearing in nine games and hauling in just nine catches for 55 yards. Beckham also played for Harbaugh and the Ravens in 2023, when he racked up over 500 yards and three touchdowns on 35 receptions.\n\nWith the Giants relying heavily on the return of Malik Nabers and many questions surrounding the wide receiver corps beyond him, Beckham could provide veteran leadership for his fellow LSU alumnus to learn from and someone the young receivers can lean on during Nabers' recovery from injury.\n\nBeckham, of course, also suffered a pair of ACL tears in his post-Giants career, including one in Super Bowl LVI, where he scored the game's first touchdown, helping the Rams secure the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nBeckham has previously expressed interest in continuing his career, and finishing it in a Giants uniform could be just what he needs. However, it would have to make sense for the Giants, who would need to feel confident in Beckham's ability to help the team at this stage of his career.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Should New York Giants reunite Odell Beckham Jr. with John Harbaugh?",

Ileana Garcia (R), co-founder of Latinas for Trump, blasted President Trump’s immigration crackdown, warning he “will lose the midterms” because of White House adviser Stephen Miller.\n\n“I do think that he will lose the midterms because of Stephen Miller,” Garcia told The New York Times in an interview published Tuesday.\n\nThough Garcia was openly supportive of Trump’s plans to close the border, she placed blame on Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, for the aggressive tactics used during the current crackdown.\n\nHer comments come after federal agents in Minneapolis over the weekend shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti amid a protest against the administration’s immigration action, weeks after an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in the city earlier this month.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti “attacked” federal law enforcement, while Miller described Pretti as “a would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal law enforcement.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday distanced Trump from those remarks, saying she had not heard the president “characterize Mr. Pretti in that way” and deferring to the investigation.\n\n“Distorting, politicizing, slandering – justifying what happened to Alex Pretti contradicts the American values the administration campaigned on.  He was neither a domestic terrorist nor an assassin,” Garcia wrote in a Monday post on the social platform X, responding to Miller’s characterization of the incident.\n\n“Allowing individuals like Stephen Miller, among others, who represent the government and make hard-line decisions, to make such comments will have long term consequences. … This is not what I voted for!” she continued.\n\nGarcia, who rallied support from Latina voters to help get Trump elected in 2016 and served in Trump’s Department of Homeland Security during his first term, has blasted what she last year called “inhumane” tactics to meet deportation goals.\n\nHer comments mark the latest sign of growing frustration with Trump’s immigration handling as fallout from the Minnesota shootings grows, as observers warn the issue could have a lingering impact on November’s high-stakes midterms.",

    "fullText": "Current New York Giants head coach John Harbaugh will forever be linked with the DMV after his long tenure as coach of the Baltimore Ravens. And those ties shone through over the weekend.\n\nHarbaugh’s first official hire as Giants head coach was bringing in former Maryland cornerback and safety Dennard Wilson to be the team’s defensive coordinator.\n\nThe 44-year-old played 42 games for the Terps between 2000-2003, finishing his senior year as team captain and an honorable mention all-ACC pick. He was also a graduate assistant for the Terps from 2007-2008, after getting his start as defensive backs coach at DeMatha High School.\n\nWilson was formerly defensive backs coach for the Ravens in 2023 — where he and Harbaugh truly connected — and defensive backs coach and passing coordinator for the Philadelphia Eagles from 2020-2022.\n\nMost recently and most notably, though, he was the defensive coordinator for the Tennessee Titans from 2024-25.\n\nUnder Wilson’s leadership in 2024, the Titans finished second in the league in total defense and passing defense — their highest ranks since 2000. This year, the Titans were ranked 21st in the league.\n\nSeveral around the Giants organization had incredibly good things to say about Wilson, who chose the Giants after also interviewing with the Los Angeles Chargers for the same role.\n\n“When asking those guys if they thought Dennard had coordinator potential, both of the men said, ‘no, this is a head coach”@Connor_J_Hughes breaks down the hiring of the Giants new defensive coordinator Dennard Wilson: pic.twitter.com/Jcz3A2GTbn\n\n— Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) January 25, 2026\n\nInterestingly, the Giants looked to hire Wilson to be their defensive coordinator in 2024, when he chose the Titans’ job over New York.\n\nNow, he’ll have to turn around a defense that has several talented pieces, including fellow Maryland alums Deonte Banks and Beau Brade, but finished 28th in the NFL in total defense last season.\n\nMaryland had a men’s basketball game Saturday.

    "fullText": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) this weekend accused Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of applying a stark double standard in her comments made after the killing of Alex Pretti by a federal agent during an anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis, the second such death in the city this month.\n\nIn one part of an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, which has gone viral with almost 3 million views on one X post alone, Ocasio-Cortez sharply criticized Noem’s suggestion that people should not attend protests with firearms, arguing the stance clashes with the Trump administration and conservatives’ fawning over previous armed protesters on the political right.\n\nPolitics: Kristi Noem Slips Up With Awkward Typo In Heated Post About Immigrants In Minneapolis\n\nPretti was a legal gun owner who was licensed to carry a concealed weapon. Minnesota law allows permit holders to carry firearms in public, including at protests. The government’s claim that he was armed and provoking violence is at odds with videos and witness statements circulating publicly.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said: “How rich is it that she is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person’s death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and the same administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse?”\n\n“When she [Noem] is talking about how merely showing up and inciting violence based on ideology against the government, when this administration has pardoned hundreds of Jan. 6th rioters who have then gone out into the streets and recommitted crimes of violence over and over again,” she continued.\n\nThe New York Democrat argued the message that is being sent is solely political: “What Secretary Noem is saying is not that you can’t do these things, is not that you can’t be armed, is not that you can’t attack your government. She just thinks that you can’t do that based on your political affiliation.”\n\nPolitics: 'I Can't Watch': Trump Fires Off Unexpected Whine At The Worst Possible Time\n\nThe lawmaker also warned: “The uncorking of chaos that this administration is trying to attempt against the American people is escalatory, it is dangerous and it is a complete abdication of leadership.”\n\n“We cannot go down this road,” Ocasio-Cortez added. “We cannot have countrymen against countrymen, citizen against citizen. This is not the America that we believe in. It is not the America that we stand in and we must unite together against this kind of very dangerous splintering that they are seeking to incite against people and divide us.”\n\nEconomist Sounds Alarm On Damage Trump Is Quietly Doing To The Economy\n\nKash Patel’s Viral Line About Protesters Sparks Anger Online\n\nMelania Trump Told To 'Read The Room' Over Documentary Stunt",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump stunned members of his inner circle by calmly predicting when his own body would be lying in state, according to a new report.\n\nThe 79-year-old president reportedly made the comment at Mar-a-Lago as television screens showed Jimmy Carter’s casket at the U.S. Capitol, telling the room: “You know, within ten years that will be me.”\n\nThe remark, attributed to a person familiar with his comments, appears in a sprawling New York Magazine profile, “The Superhuman President,” about the president’s health and psyche.\n\nThe episode adds a morbid twist to how Trump and his team now talk about 2028.\n\nOne senior White House official told New York Magazine that “the specter of death sometimes manifests in the 2028 conversation,” describing aides gaming out whether the president will be willing—or able—to mount yet another run when he will be in his early 80s.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has leaned into the idea that clinging to the presidency is what keeps him alive.\n\nTrump is already the oldest person ever to be elected president.\n\nInstead of talking about slowing down, he has repeatedly teased the prospect of running again, boasting that he could seek a third term and even what would amount to a fourth term, when he is 86, even as legal experts point out the constitutional two-term limit.\n\nTrump’s brags clash with mounting unease about his health, which the Daily Beast has led the way in reporting.\n\nIn the New York Magazine piece, aides fret about his bruised hands, frequent naps in public, and a mysterious MRI trip to Walter Reed that the White House struggled to explain.\n\nFormer White House lawyer Ty Cobb warned this month that Trump’s cognitive decline is “palpable,” while prominent physician Dr. Bruce Davison told the Beast’s podcast that the president’s daily 325 mg aspirin regimen is the kind of dose usually reserved for stroke patients.\n\nInside Trump’s circle, the result is a strange dual reality, of a president who talks about death, legacy, and what he will leave behind—from a $400 million East Wing ballroom to the “Arc de Trump” he wants erected across from the Lincoln Memorial—while still casting himself as a superhuman figure who can outwork younger rivals and defy time.\n\nAs one senior official told New York Magazine, succession talk is as much about letting Trump live forever through his chosen heirs as it is about acknowledging that he will not.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Some housing markets have a luxury tier that's far higher than the rest of home prices. Miami tops New York City for the most $1 million listings.",
    "fullText": "The lifestyles of the rich and famous sometimes seem so far out of reach.\n\nWith homes selling for upward of $50 million and billionaires building compounds to disallow regular folks from taking a glance at luxury, one end of the real estate market seems to be growing exponentially.\n\nThose enormous price tags can be jarring when looking for a home, but in reality, the median price of a luxury home is far lower. The entry point of luxury, which is defined as the 90th percentile of listing prices, was $1.19 million in December, according to Realtor.com. That price was about three times the national median home listing price of $399,950.\n\nBut there are some places where luxury, mega-luxury, and standard homes exist side-by-side. While that may seem concerning for those who are looking for affordable homes, these different markets don't always impact each other.\n\n\"Big gaps between luxury and typical home prices aren't automatically a warning sign,\" Realtor.com senior economist Anthony Smith said. \"They often point to markets that are highly segmented, where luxury behaves differently from the rest of the housing market. In those places, even small shifts at the high end can create noticeable changes in luxury pricing without spilling over to the median home price.\"\n\nFlorida, for example, has five metros that ranked in the top 10 on Realtor.com's list of places with the widest luxury gaps in real estate, partially fueled by high-net-worth individuals moving to Florida recently. Miami specifically dethroned the New York City metro area as the city with the most $1 million-plus listings in the country. The influx of high net worth individuals into Miami is also significantly linked to an exodus from the New York metro area: Realtor noted that 26.3% of the Miami metro's demand originates from the New York metro.\n\nThere will always be gaps in the housing market separating one sector from the next. But some luxury markets differ greatly from the sector below.\n\nHere are the top 10 metros where the luxury sector is the most disconnected from the typical market, according to Realtor.com.",

    "title": "From ‘Bono’ to ‘Bozo’ already? Just let NY Giants coach John Harbaugh do his work",
    "description": "Some are already irate over choices the Giants’ new head coach is making about his assistant coaches.",
    "fullText": "It is amazing how quickly the opinions of some fans can change. And, how small things no one has any idea ill prove to be right or wrong can be the cause.\n\nWhen John Harbaugh, a Super Bowl-winning head coach with 12 playoff appearances in 18 years as head coach of the Baltimore Ravens was hired less than two weeks, there was nearly absolute joy in Giants Nation. In our poll asking if hiring Harbaugh was the right decision, 95.21% (5,227) of 5,490 voters said it was.\n\nThere were comments like these:\n\nHarbaugh and Dart will deliver us another SB, I truly believe that\n\nDart’s retiring with more rings than Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson combined. Book it.\n\nI haven’t seen Big Blue Viewers this aligned on a decision in my life. May the next decade be one of redemption.\n\nNo other hiring would have been met with the excitement, or brought the instant credibility that Harbaugh did. The Giants have been flailing for more than a decade now, going mostly in the wrong direction. Harbaugh offers them the best chance for a course correction.\n\nHe comes from a winning environment that he was a big part of establishing and maintaining. He brings with him knowledge of how the Ravens have been consistently good, and the cachet to get ideas implemented with the Giants. We are already seeing some of that take place. He brings a reputation with him for having a keen eye for finding quality young assistant coaches who could help set the organization up for sustained success.\n\nOn the field and in the locker room, Harbaugh is a culture-setting CEO type head coach who brings the ability — and credibility — to set standards and hold players accountable. The Giants, and the entire organization, desperately need that.\n\nRemember John Mara warning Brian Daboll after he won Coach of the Year honors for the 2022 season that it wasn’t hard to go from ‘Bono’ to ‘Bozo’ in the New York/New Jersey market?\n\nWell, when he was introduced as the team’s head coach last Tuesday, Harbaugh was clearly ‘Bono.’ Maybe the Beatles. In a more modern reference, perhaps Taylor Swift.\n\nToday, there are already fans throwing darts at him.\n\nFirst, Harbaugh had the temerity to send Carmen Bricillo, a popular, effective offensive line coach, packing. That led to comments like these:\n\nThis sucks especially if George Warhop is the guy to take over. Nice guy in his 60’s with lots of oline coaching experience. Unfortunately heading up many underwhelming lines.\n\nThis is a questionable move at best. I just don’t understand why he wouldn’t stay — especially since he was under contract for another year and has proven that he can work wonders with what he’s given. I also find it strange since Jack Harbaugh gave a ringing endorsement and told him to keep him. I don’t understand this at all.\n\nSo there was no bigger supporter of the JH acquisition than MaineG1…. But this is a major disappointment! I don’t understand the reason behind fixing something that’s been so horribly wrong for such a long time under any circumstance. For anyone making claims that this is just minor move and, there’s no reason for concern. You obviously haven’t been paying attention over the last 10 years. Before Bricillo, the offensive line was one of the 3 worst in NFL history.\n\nI can’t understand that Harbaugh looked at that man’s resume and came to the conclusion he could get someone better? Direct disciple of Dante Scarnecchia. Plus the job he did with the Raiders. Who by the way, were an absolute shit show just slightly less terrible than the steaming pile of dung the Giants had been trotting out over the past decade.\n\nI was also a fan of Patterson, but the run defense over the last 3 years has been dreadful…. So letting him go makes sense, but, Bricillo is a head scratcher. I also hope the plan isn’t to bring in the Oline coach from the Ravens? For those who don’t know? Joe D passed away at the beginning of the season and, was replaced by George Warhop. He was the offensive line coach for the 49ers and, Bucs I believe in the early 2000s. For the most part those lines were terrible…. 2024 under Joe D, the offensive line was really good. 2025 under Warhop, absolutely shitty. This can’t be the way.\n\nThen, Harbaugh went and hired a defensive coordinator some fans think is terrible.\n\nAnother bad Tennessee DC. I have, misgivings.\n\nOkay, it was a mistake to hire Harbaugh. Everything is going to hell. Fire Schoen. The Mara’s should be forced to sell the team. Trade Dart for draft picks. Burn it to the ground.\n\nWas hoping this was not true. Here’s his report card for his last season :\n\nTotal Defense Rank: 21st in yards, 28th in points\n\nOpponent Points: 478 allowed (28th)\n\nWay to really go for excellence Coach! Forget the guy coaching in the AFC championship or the passing coordinator in one of the most complex, vicious, aggressive modern defenses. Let’s get a guy who managed to coach a 3 win teams defense to the 28th ranking.\n\nWe really managed to grab a guy from one of the only programs worse than ours, who has no idea what winning looks like, who’s defense just Barely ranked better than Shane Bowen and Bullen…? Just fking wow.\n\nLosing Bricillo and Patterson this week coupled with this latest absurd hire, It’s been a very bad week for John harbaugh.\n\nHopefully he can at least get Monken in here.\n\nFolks around here acting like Harbs just hired Shane Bowen again!\n\nGiants fans last weekend – Give Harbaugh whatever he wants, just get him signed! In Harbaugh we trust!!!\n\nGiants fans this weekend – What??? He hired a different guy than the one I wanted?? Harbaugh out!!!\n\nHarbaugh was never going to make every decision you or I would have made. Yes, I was hoping he would keep Carmen Bricillo as offensive line coach. He didn’t. So be it. There will be more decisions you don’t like. Harbaugh will be right about some, wrong about others. Probably, he will be right far more often than he is wrong.\n\nHarbaugh has an 18-year body of really successful work with the Baltimore Ravens and a Rolodex compiled over something like four decades of coaching that earned him a five-year, $100 million contract and the ability to make the decisions he wants to make.\n\nHarbaugh is the best, most capable, most qualified person the Giants have hired on their coaching staff or in their front office since they let Tom Coughlin go after the 2015 season.\n\nHe knows what he wants in an offensive line coach. He knows plenty of people who could tell him what he wanted to know about Bricillo’s work, and his coaching style. He met with Bricillo himself. He decided Bricillo wasn’t the right coach for what he wanted. I would rather have him make that choice than keep a coach on staff he wasn’t certain about to appease the fan base, or the offensive linemen.\n\nMaybe Harbaugh will hire George Warhop, a long-time NFL offensive line coach who was with him in Baltimore the last two seasons. Maybe he will hire someone else. Maybe it will turn out well. Maybe it won’t.\n\nWhen it comes to Wilson, again Harbaugh is far more qualified to make this decision and knows far more about Wilson than any of us.\n\nYou can simply point to the 2025 statistics that showed Wilson’s Tennessee defense 28th in points and 21st in yardage allowed, and decide he is a terrible coach and a terrible hire. Or, you can look deeper.\n\nYou can look back at 2024, his first season. His bio on the Titans’ website, which likely won’t be available much longer, includes this:\n\nDuring Wilson’s first year in Tennessee, the Titans ranked second overall in total defense (311.2 opponent yards per game)—the team’s highest ranking since leading the NFL in total defense in 2000. The 2024 Titans also finished second in passing defense (177.3), which also was their best ranking since 2000 (first). Wilson’s defense tied for the fifth-fewest first downs allowed per game (18.5) and tied for the fifth-fewest opponent yards allowed per play (5.2) in 2024.\n\nYou can trust ESPN Titans beat writer Turron Davenport, who told me recently that Wilson “wasn’t given much to work with” in 2025 but did a good job.\n\nYou can trust Pro Bowl defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons, who wanted Wilson to stay in Tennessee.\n\nJeffery Simmons understands it's not up to him BUT if he has it his way, he'd love to have Dennard Wilson back with the #Titans. pic.twitter.com/Kc4Qhxurko\n\n— TURRON DAVENPORT (@TDavenport_NFL) December 31, 2025\n\nYou can trust Jimmy Morris of SB Nation’s Music City Miracles, who wrote this recently predicting Wilson would land with the Giants:\n\nWilson did a really good job with the Titans this year. The numbers weren’t great, but you have to account for the fact that all three of his starting corners were either traded or injured for most of the season. He also had zero EDGE presence for the entire year.\n\nI thought that Wilson would land as the defensive coordinator for John with the New York Giants. He might still, but it would be surprising if he took the Chargers interview with Jim, knowing he could get the Giants job with John.\n\nThe Giants brought in Harbaugh because of his record of success. He is, naturally, going to want to bring in people he knows and has had success with.\n\nMaybe at least wait until the Giants blow a fourth-quarter lead next fall because of a decision Harbaugh makes that backfires before thinking he is a Bozo.",

    "fullText": "The New York Giantsare hiring Dennard Wilson as their new defensive coordinator under head coach John Harbaugh.\n\nThe 43-year-old Wilson most recently served as the Tennessee Titans' defensive coordinator, where he guided the unit to a No. 2 ranking in total defense (311.2 yards per game) and passing defense (177.3 ypg) in his debut play-calling season -- marks not seen since 2000.\n\nA former Ravens defensive backs coach under Harbaugh, Wilson brings proven secondary expertise and schematic discipline to a Giants defense that struggled mightily last year. This reunion aims to spark a much-needed turnaround.\n\nHere's how Giants fans and analysts reacted to the news.\n\nNow that the storm has calmed down I’m genuinely excited for Dennard Wilson as our DC. Leonhard would’ve been a fun big name but I remember how nasty that Titans defense was his first year. They had tons of short yardage to work on. \n\nIt’s going to be FUN.\n\n— Anthony (@AnthonyBetss) January 25, 2026\n\nOver the last two seasons here are the list of players who logged 5 or more COMBINED sacks with the Titans over the last two seasons:\n\nJeffrey Simmons 16 sacks\nJihad Ward 5 sacks\n\nThat's it. That's what Dennard Wilson had to work with. The context matters here!\n\n— Justin Penik (@JustinPenik) January 25, 2026\n\nDid A LOT with little to work with.

    "fullText": "Random thoughts while waiting on the release of the new Super Bowl commercials.\n\nThe sight of Cubs star Pete-Crow Armstrong and Bears star Caleb Williams hanging out together at the Blackhawks and Bulls games was a nice way to portray Chicago as the biggest small town in America. Los Angeles has its Hollywood culture and New York is the media center of the world, but nowhere are the local sports stars as big a deal as they are in Chicago.\n\nIt’s nothing new, of course. Chicago’s stars have always supported each other. When the Bears played at Wrigley Field, Bobby Hull was a season ticket holder, and Billy Williams used to get tickets for games from Bears receiver Dick Gordon.\n\nThe budding bromance of Crow-Armstrong and Williams should last a long time, or at least until the Cubs and Bears sign them to massive deals.\n\nOne of the primary requisites of the job of commissioner of a major sports league should be the ability to project strength. But the commissioners of the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball are all weaklings, as evidenced by a report from The Athletic that Roger Goodell, Adam Silver, Gary Bettman and Rob Manfred will meet with President Donald Trump to help promote America 250, a celebration of the country’s 250th birthday.\n\nWhile Trump’s jackboots instill fear in Minneapolis, Chicago and other American cities, and he embarrasses the country on the international stage, these four pretend leaders will be posing for photo-ops in the Oval Office and pretending all is right with the country. None of them has the courage to speak out against what’s happening in America.\n\nLucky for them, they’re only beholden to the billionaire owners of their league’s teams, not the average fans who support their respective sports.\n\nESPN’s Pat McAfee has always appealed to the lowest common denominator, so it’s no surprise the clueless commentator is taking on unidentified media members who point out his lame frat boy act, calling them “fat … lazy nerds” on his TV show.\n\nMcAfee also tweeted that sports journalists “hate what sports are for people (happiness). They hate what sports are for society (unifier) … they’re political journalists by nature who’ve preyed on sports because they saw it as an easier path to ‘make it.’ Their days are numbered … my show being broadcasted on ESPN 10 hours a week with ZERO creative say from any ‘journalism school’ puppets is living proof of that.”\n\nActually, the audience of McAfee’s show is relatively tiny, or else it would be in a better time slot than in the early afternoon, when everyone else is working. He’s already wearing thin on college football fans, and sooner or later the ratings will slide and ESPN will pull the plug and send him off to UFC analysis, where he belongs.\n\nIllinois is having another stellar season, thanks to a deep team led by freshman Keaton Wagler. The 11th-ranked Illini are 17-3 after Saturday’s 88-82 road win over Purdue and in contention for the Big Ten title.\n\nAnd when the Illini are winning, coach Brad Underwood is at his most ornery, as when he recently sparred with an Illinois reporter who praised Tomislav Ivišić for a good game against Northwestern despite what he called an “up-and-down season.”\n\n“You guys say he’s been up and down,” Underwood shot back. “I just say his role changed. You guys create more damn narratives that are full of (bleep). That’s what he does. That’s why he’s been on draft boards. He’s big and can shoot the cover off of it. … No one has ever doubted Tommy.”\n\nLove him or hate him, Underwood is never afraid to speak his mind.\n\nKudos to White Sox general manager Chris Getz for immediately spending the $20 million he saved by dumping Luis Robert Jr.’s contract, signing reliever Seranthony Dominguez to a two-year, $20 million deal. Now maybe he can move Grant Taylor into the rotation where he belongs.\n\nMike Berman was a professional and a hardworking sports reporter willing to work long hours at NBC-5. A Glenbrook North alumnus who grew up rooting for Chicago teams, he did his job for 10 years without calling attention to himself. His work spoke for itself.\n\nBerman, who was let go by the station last week, deserved a better fate. Hopefully he winds up on another local station that will appreciate his work ethic.\n\nTerry Boers, who died Friday at age 75, was remembered by most as a radio host and an original member of The Score. But he was also a great newspaperman. Boers and I competed on the Illini basketball beat for one season back in the early 1990s, when he was still at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was as good a beat writer as there was and handed me my lunch on many occasions.\n\nBoers eventually found his way to radio, where he could put his brash personality into his job. He became a legend at WSCR-AM 670, along with the other originals such as Mike North, Tom Shaer and Dan McNeil. There will never be another quite like Boers, which is why his death has brought so many tributes from colleagues.\n\nCubs manager Craig Counsell is a Green Bay Packers fan, but he assured the media he is not a Bears hater. “Look, I grew up a Packers fan for sure,” he said before the Cubs Convention. “The Bears have struggled for a while, and so when a team hasn’t done well for a whole and starts to do well, you see what it does to a city. You feel it. That part of me knows what it’s doing for the city, and you root for that a little bit.”\n\nAsked who would be booed \n\nIt’s a tough call, but my guess is Counsell is still Public Enemy No. 1 among cheeseheads.",

Polymarket also provides real-time updates, allowing bets to provide insights into how consumers and investors think.\n\nPolymarket bettors correctly predicted nearly the entire slate of Golden Globe winners last week, prompting a celebration from Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan.\n\n\"We have a long way to go to educate the public on the value of market-based forecasts, but you can't deny its accuracy,\" Coplan wrote. \"People have more clarity about the world because Polymarket exists.\"\n\nThe new markets are not strictly regulated, and some bets have looked a lot like insider trading. A last-minute bet on Polymarket earlier this month that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro would be ousted netted strong returns after the US captured Maduro in a surprise raid hours later.\n\nSnowfall totals, on the other hand, are perhaps less susceptible to market manipulation.",

    "description": "Let’s take a look at the coaches who seem most likely to run John Harbaugh’s defense.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants are continuing to search for a defensive coordinator for John Harbaugh’s defense. Here is some background on four candidates who are continually mentioned.\n\nThe 45-year-old former Miami Dolphins’ defensive coordinator seems like the leader in the clubhouse for the Giants’ job. Except for all of those pesky head-coaching interviews he keeps getting.\n\nThere are currently five head-coaching openings remaining in this hiring cycle — Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, Arizona Cardinals, Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nWeaver has interest from the Steelers and Bills for their vacancies. He interviewed with the Steelers in-person on Friday. He received an interview request from the Cardinals, but it is not clear that ever took place. He interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons before they hired Kevin Stefanski, and had two interviews with the Baltimore Ravens before they chose Jesse Minter.\n\nWeaver was defensive coordinator of the Houston Texans in 2020, and the Miami Dolphins for the past two seasons. He was in Baltimore working for Harbaugh as defensive line coach for three seasons, 2021-2023.\n\nWeaver started his NFL coaching career in 2012 working under Rex Ryan with the New York Jets. He has also coach with the Cleveland Browns and Buffalo Bills.\n\nWeaver, a defensive tackle as a player, was a second-round pick by the Ravens in 2002 and had a seven-year NFL career with Baltimore and Houston.\n\nThere is no doubt how Harbaugh feels about him. Here is what Harbaugh said about Weaver before the Dolphins hired him away from the Ravens to be defensive coordinator in 2024:\n\nHere’s what Ravens coach John Harbaugh said about Anthony Weaver. He spoke rather glowingly about him.pic.twitter.com/Vf8Ry4YJOv https://t.co/yS1KH9ESBR\n\n— David Furones (@DavidFurones_) February 2, 2024\n\nLeonhard, 43, has never coached for a Harbaugh — John or Jim. He did play for John Harbaugh in 2008, Harbaugh’s first as Ravens’ head coach.\n\nLeonhard played in the NFL for 10 seasons. He coached at Wisconsin from 2016-2022, serving as defensive coordinator beginning in 2017. He joined Sean Payton’s Denver Broncos staff in 2024 and has spent the last two seasons working under Payton and Vance Joseph. He has been defensive backs coach, pass game coordinator, and in 2025 was the Broncos’ assistant head coach.\n\nThe problem for Leonhard might be timing. The Senior Bowl begins on Tuesday in Mobile, Ala., and there is a belief that the Giants would like to have their offensive and defensive coordinators in place by then if possible.\n\nLeonhard’s Broncos play Sunday in the AFC Championship Game. If they win and go to the Super Bowl, that timeline won’t work. Even if they lose, Leonhard would have to interview, be offered and accept the job on Monday and join the Giants’ contingent on Tuesday in Alabama.\n\nThe 43-year-old Wilson is familiar to Harbaugh, and to the Giants. Wilson was Harbaugh’s defensive backs coach in Baltimore in 2023 before becoming Tennessee Titans defensive coordinator for the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Wilson also interviewed for the Giants’ job in 2024, but chose to take the Tennessee job.\n\nWilson’s defenses in Tennessee did not rank highly, but the Titans won just six games in two seasons and Wilson didn’t have a lot to work with.\n\nWilson had a supporter in Tennessee star defender Jeffery Simmons:\n\nJeffery Simmons understands it's not up to him BUT if he has it his way, he'd love to have Dennard Wilson back with the #Titans. pic.twitter.com/Kc4Qhxurko\n\n— TURRON DAVENPORT (@TDavenport_NFL) December 31, 2025\n\nWilson interviewed with the Los Angeles Chargers, coached by Jim Harbaugh, for their defensive coordinator vacancy on Friday.\n\nJones, defensive backs coach and defensive pass game coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings, is probably an underdog for the job.\n\nJones did interview with Harbaugh earlier in the week. He also interviewed for the Giants’ job in 2024.\n\nJones’ NFL resume includes stops with the Miami Dolphins, Cincinnati Bengals, and two stints with the Vikings. Jones has also coached in high school, at the Division II level, in the FCS, FBS, and in the Canadian Football League.\n\nJones has also drawn interest from the Dallas Cowboys , New York Jets, and Green Bay Packers.",

    "fullText": "For some, Mayor Zohran Mamdani has already failed when it comes to what is traditionally a big test for New York City mayors: dealing with a major snowstorm.\n\nThe new mayor is getting roasted online after issuing a warning about the massive snow event that’s coming this weekend, the New York Post reported.\n\n“NYC is forecasted to get 3–16 inches of snow this weekend. And we’re ready,” Mamdani wrote on X on Thursday afternoon as part of a post on the city’s prep for the storm.\n\nNYC is forecasted to get 3–16 inches of snow this weekend. And we’re ready.\n\nWe’ll issue a Code Blue later today, and outreach workers will ramp up efforts to connect unhoused New Yorkers to safe shelter.\n\nTomorrow, we'll begin pre-snow treatment, brining highways and major…\n\n— Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@NYCMayor) January 22, 2026\n\n“3-16, way to narrow down the forecast,” one user on X commented.\n\n“Saying that NYC is going to get between 3 and 16 inches of snow is nonsense,” another said. “That tells you absolutely nothing. Citing numbers with a probability range of 5% to 95% is idiotic and moronic.”\n\n“Maybe they forgot the 1 in front of the 3? Idk?” said another snarky commenter.\n\nThe Post said that the five boroughs were already under a winter storm watch, issued by the National Weather Service, calling for 6-12 inches of snow when Mamdani posted his statement.\n\nCurrent forecasts call for anywhere from 8-14 inches of snow to fall on the city this weekend.\n\nNew York City mayors in the past have been lambasted for poor reactions to snowstorms.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio was scorched in 2014 when Islanders railed that plows and salters were slow to the rescue after a big snowstorm.\n\nMayor John Lindsay got clobbered when the city was slow to react to a 1969 snowstorm.\n\nAnd Mayor Michael Bloomberg took a pounding when the city flubbed the 2010 Christmas blizzard.\n\nThat was the year that Bloomberg pushed back against critics who said that the city was slow to react to the storm, saying that “The city is going fine. Broadway shows were full last night.”",

    "fullText": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Macklin Celebrini had two goals to end his longest drought of the season, pacing the San Jose Sharks to a 3-1 win over the New York Rangers on Friday night.\n\nCelebrini’s 25th and 26th goals of the season were his first since Jan. 7, a six-game stretch.\n\nThe No. 1 overall pick in 2024, Celebrini had a chance for his third hat trick of the season but his shot in the third period was stopped by Rangers goalie Martin Spencer and the puck rolled slowly to the side of the net.\n\nPavol Regenda added his eighth goal for the Sharks while Will Smith and Collin Graf each had two assists. Alex Nedeljkovic made 28 saves.\n\nSam Carrick had his second goal in six games for New York, which lost its third straight and is now 2-8-1 over its last 11 games.\n\nCelebrini got the Sharks on the board quickly with a power-play goal 1:09 into the first period. Celebrini got positioned in front of the Islanders net and scored off a quick pass from Tyler Toffoli.\n\nSan Jose added a second power-play goal less than two minutes later when Regenda flipped a backhand shot that went over Martin’s left shoulder. Michael Misa and Graf assisted.\n\nCelebrini scored his second goal of the night at the 7:37 mark in the first period. Chants of “MVP MVP” for the 19-year-old broke out moments later.\n\nCarrick’s goal was his third of the season for the Rangers. Taylor Raddysh and Anton Blidh assisted.

    "fullText": "Aaron Glenn is searching for a new defensive coordinator for his second season with the Jets. Here's the latest on that search...\n\nThe Jets are moving on from a number of coaches, including QB coach Charles London, DL coach Eric Washington, LB coach Aaron Curry and pass game coordinator Scott Turner.\n\nSNY's Connor Hughes said on the latest episode of Jets Final Drive that players had \"a lot\" of issues with Washington and Curry, but Turner being relieved comes as a surprise.\n\nWith the mid-season release of DC Steve Wilks, Jets coach Aaron Glenn has now relieved five coaches of their duties.\n\nThe Jets were busy in the second week of their offseason, completing a first round of interviews for eight candidates for the vacant DC job.\n\nThe team announced that they completed virtual interviews with Wink Martindale, Jim Leonhard, Chris Harris, Jim O'Neil, DeMarcus Covington, Daronte Jones, Mathieu Araujo, and Ephraim Banda.\n\nMartindale is the most senior of the group at 65 years old and has the most experience as a defensive coordinator at the NFL level. Recently, the DC at Michigan, he worked last in the NFL with the Giants, where he had a rocky relationship with then-head coach Brian Daboll. Martindale also held the DC job for four seasons in Baltimore and one in Denver.\n\nLeonhard started 40 games over three seasons as a safety for the Jets. After finishing a 10-year playing career, he entered coaching, spending several years at his alma mater, Wisconsin. He was the DC with the Badgers from 2017-22, finishing as the interim head coach for the last seven games. He made the jump to the NFL in 2024 with another of his former teams, the Broncos, where he's been a defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator for the past two seasons, adding assistant head coach to his title this year.\n\nHarris was hired to Glenn's staff last offseason to be the defensive back coach and passing game coordinator, but finished as interim DC after Steve Wilks' firing. Before coming to New York, the eight-year NFL veteran was Washington's defensive backs coach (2020-22) and Tennessee's DBs coach and passing game coordinator (2023-24).\n\nO'Neil has experience with Glenn in Detroit, where he's worked as a defensive assistant since 2024. He got his first NFL gig with the Jets in 2009 as a defensive quality control coach before serving as assistant DBs coach from 2010-12. He was Cleveland's defensive coordinator for two seasons (2014-15), along with NFL stops in Buffalo (2013), San Francisco (2016), Oakland/Las Vegas (2019-20).\n\nCovington also has experience working as a DC in the NFL, holding that position with New England during the 2024 season. He first joined the Patriots under Bill Belichick, serving as a coaching assistant, outside linebackers coach, and defensive line coach after joining in 2016. He served as defensive line coach/run game coordinator with Green Bay in 2025.\n\nJones was the passing game coordinator and defensive backs coach with the Vikings. He first came to Minnesota in 2020, leaving for one season to be LSU's defensive coordinator in 2021.\n\nAraujo spent the past four seasons, his first in the pro ranks as a coach, with Miami coaching defensive backs.\n\nBanda has been the Browns' safeties coach since 2023 after spending several years coaching in college, including a stint as the DC at Utah State (2021-22).",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks have been struggling lately, causing trade speculation around the team to grow louder.\n\nOne player who has been mentioned in trade rumors is center Karl-Anthony Towns, who has clashed with head coach Mike Brown about his role with the team this season.\n\nBut Knicks reporter Ian Begley said Thursday that New York has not had internal discussions about trading Towns.\n\n\"The Knicks are not having conversations on trading Karl-Anthony Towns,\" Begley said. \"As of Monday, it was not happening.\"\n\nMore:Bill Simmons proposes wild LeBron James for Towns trade\n\nNew York has lost nine of its past 12 games and has just three wins since the calendar flipped to 2026. The Knicks got back in the win column Wednesday with a 120-66 win against the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nBegley believes the Knicks may consider drastic trades if the team has another rough stretch before the Feb. 5 trade deadline.\n\n\"If you see another 2-9 stretch or something like that ahead of the trade deadline, I think that's when you have to consider that, 'Hey, we need to shake something up here,'\" he said.\n\nTowns is averaging 20.8 points, 11.5 rebounds and shooting 46.9% from the field this season. He is in his second season in New York after being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves before last season.\n\nTowns' max contract is fully guaranteed through the 2027-28 season, making him a difficult player to trade. But the Begley thinks Knicks are intent on keeping him for now.\n\n\"I don't think they're there yet,\" he said. \"They're not out there shopping Karl-Anthony Towns.\"\n\nThe Knicks (26-18) return to action Saturday night against the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n76ers' Tyrese Maxey lands signature shoe deal\n\nLakers legend rumored to be involved in 'NBA Europe' project\n\nESPN NBA analyst gives Lakers' season mediocre grade\n\nMichael Jordan's 'NBA on NBC' appearance disappointing for fans\n\nDeMarcus Cousins makes bold claim about LeBron James' future\n\nHeat could keep promising young player for potential Giannis trade",

    "fullText": "There is no tougher runner in the NFL right now than Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry.\n\nThe future Hall of Famer is currently the NFL's leader in touchdowns (127) and rushing yards (13,018) among active players, and his highlight reel is filled with defenders bouncing off his invincible body.\n\nHenry began his career in Tennessee and moved to Baltimore two years ago to better his chances at a Super Bowl and played those two seasons under head coach John Harbaugh, who was fired last week by the Ravens after 18 seasons.\n\n“I love Coach. He’s a great leader,\" Henry told The Escapist in a recent interview. \"Enjoyed my time with him in Baltimore. Kind of sad that it ended while I came to Baltimore, but I wish Coach the best. I definitely appreciate everything that he’s taught us and taught me through these last two years of me being a new guy.”\n\nHarbaugh has naturally moved on to the New York Giants to become their new head coach.\n\nHenry, the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner and five-time Pro Bowler, was asked how Harbaugh treats his players. His answer should delight the Giants and their fans.\n\n“He’s had a great philosophy about how he ran the organization and how he treated the players,\" Henry said. \"After we won, he would point out every single player that had an impact on the game. Even if it doesn’t get noticed nationally, he made sure that they’re appreciated throughout the organization for the effort that they put into the team.”\n\nBut, more importantly, Harbaugh will bring structure and discipline back to the Giants. After 10 double-digit losing seasons over the past 12 years, the Giants and their fans are finally getting a coach deserving of the title.\n\n\"As we begin a new chapter in New York, our focus is simple,\" Harbaugh said in his introductory press conference with th Giants this week, \"it starts with building a team that is physical and tough, that's capable of overwhelming their opponent from beginning to end, and especially at the end, that understands how to finish, that is smart and disciplined, that plays the game the way it should be played, and that everybody watching it, including those playing it, would be proud of.\n\n\"We're going to work together. We have great and talented people to accomplish a shared mission. There will be a relentless commitment to this organization, to this city and the fans to do things the right way every single day. Nothing will be taken for granted. It will always, always be all about the team. The team, the team, the team. Thanks, Dad, for that. It'll always be about that. Now it's time to go to work.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Derrick Henry: New York Giants' John Harbaugh 'a great leader'",

    "description": "An expedition off the coast of Massachusetts has confirmed the existence of a freshwater reservoir beneath the seafloor. Now, scientists are starting to understand when and how it formed.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA giant reservoir of \"secret\" fresh water off the East Coast that could potentially supply a city the size of New York City for 800 years may have formed during the last ice age, when the region was covered in glaciers, researchers say.\n\nPreliminary analyses suggest the reservoir, which sits beneath the seafloor and appears to stretch from offshore New Jersey as far north as Maine, was locked in place under frigid conditions around 20,000 years ago, hinting that it formed in the last glacial period due, partly, to thick ice sheets.\n\nLast summer, researchers went on an expedition to follow up on reports from the late 1960s and early 1970s of fresh water beneath the seafloor off the East Coast. \"It was quite the project and sort of a lifelong dream,\" Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist and a professor of geophysics at the Colorado School of Mines, told Live Science.\n\nThe research voyage, known as Expedition 501, lasted three months and dredged up 13,200 gallons (50,000 liters) of water from beneath the seafloor in three locations off the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. The results aren't finalized yet, but so far it looks as if the reservoir might stretch farther underground than early reports suggested, meaning it might be even bigger than previously thought.\n\nDugan and his colleagues also think they know what created the reservoir thanks to preliminary radiocarbon, noble gas and isotope analyses, he said.\n\nFresh water in the region was first reported 60 years ago by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), during offshore mineral and energy resource assessments between Florida and Maine. \"In a very peculiar way, they found fresh water in the sediment beneath the ocean,\" Dugan said. \"In the 1980s, some of the USGS people came up with ideas of how that fresh water could get there. Then it went quiet for a while — no one was talking about it.\"\n\nIn 2003, Dugan and Mark Person, a professor of hydrology at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, rediscovered these records and came up with three ideas of how fresh water can end up beneath the ocean. One way that a submarine freshwater reservoir can form is if sea levels are very low for a long time and rainfall seeps into the ground. Then, when sea levels rise again over hundreds of thousands of years, that fresh water gets trapped in the underlying sediment, Dugan said.\n\nA second possibility is that tall mountains close to the ocean funnel rainwater directly down into the seabed from their high elevation point, he said. And thirdly — related to the first hypothesis — a freshwater reservoir can form under the ocean if ice sheets expand, causing sea levels to drop. Meltwater collects at the bottom of ice sheets because they grind against the bedrock, producing heat. The huge weight of the ice sheet then pushes that water into the ground, trapping it beneath layers of sediment.\n\nMore than two decades later, the researchers are finally close to getting an answer, with preliminary data indicating that most of the fresh water came from glaciers some time during the last ice age (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). \"We kind of ruled out the large topography for New England, because we don't have big mountains next to the coast,\" Dugan said. However, \"there might be a rainfall component\" blended in the glacier water, he said. \"You can imagine that in front of a glacier you have rainfall, so it's probably a mixed system.\"\n\nExpedition 501 extracted water samples from sites 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast of Massachusetts. The researchers drilled down to 1,300 feet (400 meters) below the seafloor, which was deep enough to reveal a thick layer of sediment engorged with fresh water sitting beneath a layer of salty sediment and an impermeable \"seal\" of clay and silt.\n\n\"We have a seal at the top [of the fresh water] that keeps the seawater above from the fresh water below,\" Dugan said. This seal is strong enough to separate the two layers now, but it wasn't robust enough to stop a glacier from forcing water down through it — if that is what happened. \"Whatever emplaced that water didn't care if there was a seal. There was enough energy to flush it with fresh water,\" he said.\n\nSalinity measurements showed that water freshness in the reservoir drops with distance from the shore, but it stays well below ocean salinity in the areas studied last summer. The drill site closest to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard had a salt content of 1 part per 1,000, which is the maximum safe limit for drinking water. Farther offshore, salt content was 4 to 5 parts per 1,000, and at the farthest site, the researchers recorded 17 to 18 parts per 1,000 — or about half of the ocean's average salt content.\n\n—1.2 billion-year-old groundwater is some of the oldest on Earth\n\n—Scientists discover enormous reservoir hidden in Cascades — more than twice the amount of water in Lake Mead\n\n—Enough fresh water is lost from continents each year to meet the needs of 280 million people. Here's how we can combat that.\n\n\"The important part was we collected all the samples we need to address our primary questions,\" Dugan said. \"When we're done drilling and we pull our equipment out, the holes collapse back in and seal themselves up.\"\n\nNow, scientists are studying the reservoir in finer detail, including any microbes, rare earth elements, pore space — which can help researchers better estimate the reservoir's size — and the age of the sediments, which will help narrow down when it formed. More definitive results about how and when the reservoir formed are expected in about one month's time, Dugan said.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide an understanding of the system so if and when somebody needs to use it, they have information to start from, rather than recreating information or making an ill-informed choice,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — In two decades of kicking in doors for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Joseph Bongiovanni often took on the risks of being the “lead breacher,\" meaning he was the first person into the room.\n\nOn Wednesday, he felt a familiar uncertainty awaiting sentencing for using his DEA badge to protect childhood friends who became prolific drug traffickers in Buffalo, New York.\n\n“I never knew what was on the other side of that door — that fear is what I feel today,” Bongiovanni, 61, told a federal judge, pounding the defense table as his face reddened with emotion. “I've always been innocent. I loved that job.”\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Lawrence J. Vilardo sentenced the disgraced lawman to five years in federal prison on a string of corruption counts. The punishment was significantly less than the 15 years prosecutors sought even after a jury acquitted Bongiovanni of the most serious charges he faced, including an allegation he pocketed $250,000 in bribes from the Mafia.\n\nThe judge said the sentence reflected the complexity of the mixed verdicts following two lengthy trials and the almost Jekyll-and-Hyde nature of Bongiovanni's career, in which the lawman racked up enough front-page accolades to fill a trophy case.\n\nBongiovanni once hurtled into a burning apartment building to evacuate residents through billowing smoke. He locked up drug dealers, including the first ever prosecuted in the region for causing a fatal overdose.\n\n“There are two completely polar opposite versions of the facts and polar opposite versions of the defendant,” Vilardo said, assuring prosecutors five years behind bars would pose a considerable hardship to someone who has never been to prison.\n\nDefense attorney Parker MacKay noted the judge had acknowledged Bongiovanni as a “beacon” of the Buffalo community. The government's request for a 15-year sentence, he added, was “completely unmoored to the nature of the convictions.”\n\n“As Mr. Bongiovanni told the judge at sentencing, he is innocent, and we look forward to continuing to work with him to prove that,” MacKay told The Associated Press.\n\nA jury in 2024 convicted Bongiovanni of four counts of obstruction of justice, counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and making false statements to law enforcement.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's “little dark secret” caused immeasurable damage over 11 years. They likened him to Jose Irizarry, a disgraced former DEA agent serving a 12-year federal sentence after confessing to laundering money for Colombian drug cartels.\n\nBongiovanni upheld an oath not to the DEA, they argued, but to organized crime figures in the tight-knit Italian American community of his North Buffalo upbringing. During sentencing, Bongiovanni’s family dissolved into tears on the front row of the packed courtroom in downtown Buffalo.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's corruption involved as much inaction as calculated coverup. They pointed to a turning point in 2008 when Bongiovanni could have acted on intelligence about traffickers he knew whose operation would evolve into a large-scale organization with links to California, Vancouver, and New York City.\n\nHe also was accused of authoring bogus DEA reports, stealing sensitive files, throwing off colleagues, outing confidential informants, covering for a sex-trafficking strip club and helping a high school English teacher keep his marijuana-growing side hustle. Prosecutors said he brazenly urged colleagues to spend less time investigating Italians and focus instead on Black and Hispanic people.\n\n“His conduct shook the foundation of law enforcement — and this community — to its core,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi told the judge. “That's what a betrayal is.”\n\nThe ex-agent's downfall came amid a sex-trafficking prosecution that took sensational turns, including an implicated judge who killed himself after the FBI raided his home, law enforcement dragging a pond in search of an overdose victim and dead rats planted outside the home of a government witness who prosecutors allege was later killed by a fatal dose of fentanyl.\n\nIt also involved the Pharoah’s Gentlemen’s Club outside Buffalo. Bongiovanni was childhood friends with the strip club’s owner, Peter Gerace Jr., who authorities say has close ties to both the Buffalo Mafia and the violent Outlaws Motorcycle Club. A separate jury convicted Gerace of a sex trafficking conspiracy and of paying bribes to Bongiovanni.\n\nThe prosecution also cast a harsh light on the DEA after a string of corruption scandals prompted at least 17 agents brought up on federal charges over the past decade. Last month, prosecutors charged another former agent with conspiring to launder millions of dollars and obtain military-grade firearms and explosives for a Mexican drug cartel.\n\nFrank Tarentino, the DEA’s northeast associate chief of operations, said Bongiovanni’s sentence “sends a powerful message that those who betray their badge will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”",

    "description": "Bo Bichette was introduced by the Mets at Citi Field on Wednesday after signing with New York in free agency.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK — The image of the Dodgers pouring out onto the field at Rogers Centre, celebrating a victory over the Blue Jays in Game 7 of the World Series last fall, will be ingrained in Bo Bichette’s mind forever.\n\nHe still hasn’t gotten over the end of that game — and the Blue Jays’ remarkable playoff run — in the months since.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bichette was in a new jersey, introduced to his new team, in a new city. And, in some ways, he was able to relieve that pain from November.\n\nHe firmly believes that his new team, the Mets, will give him an opportunity to get back to that stage again, as early as this year, with a real chance to finish the job this time around.\n\nThat, Bichette said, was part of what tipped the scales in his negotiations with multiple teams in free agency. It’s what made it “very obvious” that he wanted to be a Met.\n\n“My first priority is winning,” Bichette said, donning his No. 19 Mets jersey for the first time. “This organization is doing everything they can to do that.”\n\nBo Bichette was asked today how long it took for him to get over Game 7 of the World Series with the Blue Jays:\n\n\"I don't know if I have yet. This is probably helping. But yeah, to be that close, you never know when you're gonna get that opportunity again, but I think this team…\n\n— Max Goodman (@MaxTGoodman) January 21, 2026\n\nBichette signed a three-year deal with the Mets last week, a $126 million pact that contains opt-outs after both his first and second seasons. It was reported that Bichette was close to a seven year, $200 million deal with the rival Phillies, but he chose the Mets hours later.\n\nWhen asked on Wednesday if he is treating his contract with the Mets as a one-year deal, one of Bichette’s agents — Greg Genske — chimed in.\n\n“His commitment is to the Mets,” Genske said. “His desire is to be here. His desire is compete for championships here.”\n\nMany fans will question that logic. The Mets missed the playoffs in 2025 and seemingly took steps back during the first half of this offseason. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, were two outs away from winning the World Series in the ninth inning of Game 7 less than three months ago. They won their division last season and advanced to the Fall Classic without Bichette, who was sidelined by a left knee sprain that kept him out until the World Series. Toronto has been active in bolstering their roster this winter. Plus, other high-spending contenders — like the Phillies — were contenders in the Bichette sweepstakes.\n\nBichette’s reasoning is rooted in the actions of owner Steve Cohen and Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns. He thinks the Mets have a roster that supports their offseason initiative to turn this franchise into a true perennial championship contender.\n\n“Mr. Cohen and David have put together an organization that is looking to win every single year, has an opportunity to win a World Series every single year and a roster that backs that up,” Bichette said. “It’s very exciting to be a part of this city, one of the best cities in the world — maybe the best city in the world. The fans, some of the best fans in the world. All of that is something I’ve always wanted to be a part of.\"\n\nThat’s part of the calculus in Bichette’s willingness to change positions heading into the 2026 season, too. He’ll be moving from shortstop to third base with the Mets, something he was open to throughout his dip into free agency, so long as he was signing with a team that gave him a good chance to win.\n\n“I’m excited for the challenge,” Bichette said. “It’s just like anything else, it’s gonna take work to be good at something. I’m willing to put in that work and we’ll get after it.”\n\nBichette will land in the middle of a formidable lineup that includes Fransisco Lindor, Juan Soto, Marcus Semien and Luis Robert, Jr., whom the Mets acquired Tuesday night in a trade with the White Sox.\n\nStearns isn’t concerned about Bichette being used at the hot corner for the first time in his professional career. He trusts that Bichette’s range at shortstop will translate to third and that he can handle the longer throws. Stearns has been prioritizing run prevention and defensive improvements all winter. Even with Jorge Polanco making a similar transition this year to now starting at first base for the Mets, Stearns is confident in this new-look group (with Semien at second and Lindor returning at shortstop).\n\n“There are going to be certain days this season, probably a lot of days this season, where we’re playing four shortstops on the infield, and that’s a pretty distinct advantage,” Stearns said. “The majority of that learning curve is going to be where to be on certain plays. Frankly, some things that may not be completely perceptible. We’re probably going to make a mistake or two. But we’re also going to have elite range around the infield and that’s pretty exciting.”\n\nBichette singled out positioning, bunt plays and a new type of throw across the diamond as the biggest challenges of this transition. Mets manager Carlos Mendoza, who will play a key role in helping Bichette with his defense this spring, has faith that the 27-year-old can pull it off.\n\n“It’s a different angle that you could take from there,” Mendoza said, “But he’s athletic and has work ethic, a lot of the things that will make the transition hopefully a lot smoother.”",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — From hitting in the clutch to testing free agency, Bo Bichette has soaked up plenty of baseball advice from his big league dad over the years.\n\nDante Bichette doesn't have much to offer about handling the hot corner, though.\n\nAfter signing a $126 million, three-year contract with the New York Mets, the younger Bichette was formally introduced by the team Wednesday and pulled on a No. 19 jersey at a packed Citi Field news conference.\n\nA two-time All-Star shortstop with the Toronto Blue Jays, Bichette will shift to third base with the Mets, who have Francisco Lindor entrenched at shortstop. Bichette said he hasn't played third since travel ball as a teenager.\n\n“I’m excited for the challenge. I mean, it’s just like anything else: It’s going to take work to be good at something, and I’m willing to put in that work and we’ll get after it,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there’s different positioning, different plays you have to deal with at third base that I’m going to have to get used to and learn, but I think that’s all attainable.”\n\nDante Bichette, in attendance Wednesday along with other family members, was a four-time All-Star outfielder from 1988-2001. Known much more for his bat than glove, he played one inning at third base for Milwaukee in 1991.\n\n“I didn’t know he did that. I had no idea,\" Bo Bichette said with a grin. \"That would be interesting to watch.”\n\nHousehold jabs aside, the new-look Mets are confident Bichette can make the switch successfully.\n\nHe didn't grade well at shortstop last year, and Bichette entered free agency this offseason willing to move to second or third. He plans to call former Toronto teammate Matt Chapman, a five-time Gold Glove winner at the hot corner, to get some thoughts about manning third.\n\n“This is a player who is universally respected for his aptitude and his work ethic on the field,\" Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said about Bichette. \"And so when you combine those two things it generally gives you comfort that they can make adjustments, make changes, and Bo is very confident that he’s going to be able to do this, and everything we’ve seen backs that up.”\n\nBichette spurned the NL East rival Philadelphia Phillies to sign with the Mets and gives them a proven hitter with a potent right-handed bat to help complement lefty slugger Juan Soto.\n\nBichette batted .311 with 18 home runs, 94 RBIs and an .840 OPS in 139 games last year for the Blue Jays, who fell one win short of a World Series title.\n\nHe hit a three-run homer off Shohei Ohtani in Game 7 of the Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and is a .330 career hitter with runners in scoring position — the third-best mark in the majors among qualified hitters since 2019.\n\nBichette batted .381 with RISP last season.\n\n“I don’t know if my eyes light up or anything like that, but definitely probably get a little bit more focus,\" he said. \"And my dad taught me a lot about it. That’s all I heard about growing up was driving in runs, so I’ve put a lot of work into it.”\n\nBichette, who turns 28 in March, gets a $40 million signing bonus payable March 15 and a $2 million salary this year. He has $42 million player options for 2027 and 2028. If he declines either option, he would receive a $5 million buyout, payable in $1 million installments each July 1 from 2036-40.\n\n“We had a lot of conversations about the different structure of the deal, and Bo had his choice of long-term deals, shorter-term deals, opt outs,\" agent Greg Genske said. “His priority was finding a place where he felt like he could get better as a player and have a chance to compete for championships.”\n\nNew York signed right-handed reliever Luis García to a $1.75 million, one-year contract. He can earn $1.25 million in performance bonuses for games pitched: $100,000 for 25, $150,000 each for 30 and 35, $175,000 for 40, $200,000 for 45, $225,000 for 50 and $250,000 for 55.\n\nGarcía, who turns 39 this month, went 2-2 with a 3.42 ERA and two saves in 58 combined appearances last season with the Dodgers, Nationals and Angels. He is 28-30 with a 4.07 ERA and 17 saves in 13 major league seasons.\n\nTo open a spot for García on the 40-man roster, infielder Tsung-Che Cheng was designated for assignment.\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump knows he's aligning himself with the progressive left when it comes to credit cards.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen in Davos on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that his call for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates isn't a standard conservative policy.\n\nIn fact, he joked that it's something that New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, might have come up with.\n\n\"I know it's sort of like… it sounds like the mayor of New York maybe came up with that,\" Trump said with a laugh.\n\nFollowing Mamdani's election in November, the two met in the Oval Office and appeared to share some common ground in remarks to the press afterwards.\n\n\"I'm conservative, but I think I'm common sense, you know?\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"People say, 'Are you a conservative?' I say, 'Yeah, but I'm a common-sense person.' I mean, I do things that aren't necessarily that conservative sometimes.\"\n\nTrump said he respected credit card companies but that consumers can't afford to pay high rates.\n\n\"Whatever happened to usury? They can't pay 28%,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump called on Congress to pass a bill capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\n\nKey Republicans in Congress have been cool to that idea, with House Speaker Mike Johnson telling reporters last week that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy and that credit card companies may \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nMany business leaders have also been critical of the idea.\n\nYet Trump's call has also been met with agreement from some progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom Trump called last week.\n\nIn Congress, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill that would do just what Trump said, capping credit card rates at 10% for a year.",

Miller scored two goals for the Rangers, who are last in the Eastern Conference after losing seven of eight.\n\nJonathan Quick made 23 saves in his third start and fourth appearance against the Kings, who drafted him in 2005. Quick, who turns 40 years old on Wednesday, won 370 games — 199 more than any other Kings goalie — while backstopping the club to two Stanley Cup championships during his 16 seasons in LA.\n\nKempe scored 18 seconds after the opening faceoff.\n\nOnly 42 seconds after Will Cuylle’s goal for New York, Fiala scored his 18th goal by intercepting an unwise pass by former Kings teammate Vladislav Gavrikov.\n\nMiller evened it again late in the first off Mika Zibanejad’s pass.\n\nWard put the Kings back ahead early in the second, banking in a skittering shot off Quick’s far post for his first goal of the season. After Los Angeles killed a five-on-three disadvantage for 96 seconds, Kuzmenko backhanded home a rebound of Fiala’s shot.\n\nMiller scored his 13th goal in the final seconds with Quick pulled for an extra attacker.\n\nRangers: At San Jose on Friday.\n\nKings: At St. Louis on Saturday to open a six-game road trip.",

    "description": "Taking a look at a Jets pass rusher",
    "fullText": "Over the next few months, we’ll be taking an in-depth look at some of the late season signings who are under contract for 2026, and futures signings after the end of the season. We continue today with edge defender Ochaun Mathis, who was added to the practice squad late last year and signed a futures deal after the season.\n\nThe 27-year old Mathis is listed at 6’5″ and 260 pounds and was a sixth round pick out of Nebraska in 2023 having also played at TCU. He has played 14 NFL games, recording five tackles, a quarterback hit and a forced fumble.\n\nMathis was a three-star high school recruit and headed to TCU where he played four games in 2018 and then redshirted.\n\nOver the next three seasons, he started 34 games and had over 40 tackles in each season with a total of 30 tackles for loss and 16 sacks. His best season, for which he earned second team all-Big 12 recognition, was 2020, in which he had 9.5 sacks in 10 games. However, he also earned second team recognition in 2021.\n\nAfter the 2021 season, Mathis entered the transfer portal and opted to move to Nebraska. However, he was mostly in a rotational role with the Cornhuskers, starting just two games. He was productive, though, with a career-high 48 tackles and 3.5 sacks.\n\nMathis attended the 2023 scouting combine, after which he was rated as a potential late-round pick and ended up getting selected in the sixth round by the Rams.\n\nAfter a training camp injury meant he missed preseason and the start of the regular season, Mathis struggled to crack the rotation. He ultimately made eight appearances as a rookie and had just two tackles and a hit.\n\nIn 2024, he was among the Rams’ final cuts and ended up on New England’s practice squad from where he made it onto their active roster and had two tackles and a forced fumble in five appearances. However, he was released in November.\n\nThe Eagles then signed Mathis to their practice squad and he made one appearance, with one tackle, down the stretch.\n\nHe did not play in the NFL this season, despite spending time with the Eagles, Titans and Browns. The Jets signed him to their practice squad in late December but did not elevate him for any games. They did sign him to a futures deal after the season, though.\n\nLet’s move onto some more in-depth analysis of what Mathis brings to the table as a player, based on extensive research and film study.\n\nMathis has an average sized frame but terrific length and some of his combine numbers were good. He ran a 4.73 in the 40-yard dash and posted 21 bench press reps, along with above average explosiveness and agility numbers. He improved his broad jump by another five inches at his pro day.\n\nThere are times on film when it is apparent he could benefit from adding some strength.\n\nMathis has primarily played on the edge, both in four-man fronts (at TCU) and as an outside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme (at Nebraska), so he has plenty of experience of playing both with his hands in the dirt and standing up.\n\nHe also played off the ball at times, but did not play inside, although he sometimes lined up across from an opposing tackle.\n\nMathis brings high energy and effort in pursuit and in the trenches, with many of his sacks coming as a result of relentlessness meaning he eventually gets home for a coverage sack rather than beating someone clean.\n\nMathis posted an impressive 9.5 sacks in 10 games in 2020 but otherwise had just 10 in 40 other games in his career. In addition, his pressure rates were fairly consistent but nothing special. He hasn’t had much success in NFL regular season or preseason action either, other than a few flashes.\n\nAs a pass rusher, he showcases a decent get-off and can bend the edge to a degree.\n\nHe is someone who can be effective on interior rushes if standing up at the line or stunting inside.\n\nHowever, NFL linemen have typically been able to stay in front of him or redirect him upfield.\n\nMathis is a decent run defender, who can pursue downhill and plays with good discipline on the edge.\n\nHe can be controlled and sealed off by opposing tackles on the edge but has the physicality to take on lead blockers.\n\nMathis is relentless in pursuit, with good closing speed and an ability to extend beyond his frame to wrap up and drag down ball carriers.\n\nHe averaged just over five missed tackles per season in college with eight being the most he ever had in a season.\n\nHe can make some hard hits but had one forced fumble in his college career although he has had another in the NFL.\n\nMathis doesn’t necessary showcase a mastery of a variety of pass rushing moves, but his 35.5-inch arms give him a good foundation to work with and he’s shown signs of being able to exploit a length advantage at times.\n\nHe could probably benefit from sharpening up his footwork to disguise his rush and honing his technique when ripping through as he comes around the edge, but he shows some ability to vary up his rush speed.\n\nMathis hasn’t dropped into coverage that often but he does do it from time to time and is probably more experienced at doing so than most edge defenders at this level, unless they converted from another position.\n\nMost of his six career pass breakups come from getting his hands up to deflect passes; something which he is adept at. However, on this play, despite not getting his head turned, he did a great job of staying with the back to save a potential big play.\n\nHe also intercepted a pass on a two-point conversion attempt, early on in a game TCU ultimately won 34-32.\n\nMost of Mathis’ experience on special teams has been rushing kicks, with his athletic ability on display on this field goal block.\n\nHe also made this special teams tackle and forced a fumble in kickoff coverage during 2024 regular season action.\n\nMathis’ discipline and play recognition seem sound but he perhaps lacks natural pass rushing instincts in terms of transitioning to a counter move when his initial rush is repelled.\n\nHe shows versatility and makes a great play here as he blows up the blocker to bottle up a receiver screen.\n\nHe has jumped offside a few times during his college career.\n\nMathis is regarded as a player who works hard to improve and studies and prepares hard. While he wasn’t a team captain, he is a hard worker who sets a good example. Mathis’ high school team never had a winning season, and he has played with a chip on his shoulder since then, feeling he has gone under the radar.\n\nOn-field discipline is not a major concern as he has no penalties at the NFL level and just nine in his college career, five of which were in 2021.\n\nMathis was carted off with a knee injury during training camp in his rookie season and began the season on injured reserve, although he returned to action in October. He otherwise hasn’t had to deal with major injury issues.\n\nUntil we know who the defensive coordinator is, we can’t say for sure if Mathis will be a good fit for the system, but the Jets obviously targeted him and retained him because he fits some of the things Aaron Glenn likes to do and, as noted, he played on teams with both three and four-man fronts so should be adaptable.\n\nIt’s not impossible he could have the skill-set to be considered for a position switch into an off-ball role, but that would be a long-term project.\n\nHe was a teammate of current Jets cornerback Samuel Womack in Tennessee and offensive lineman Liam Fornadel in New England.\n\nMathis has shown a few brief glimpses of his talent since being drafted but is yet to prove he can crack an NFL rotation or that he has the ability to be productive at this level if given an opportunity.\n\nNevertheless, the Jets presumably liked his potential as a draft prospect and, having brought him in for a look, opted to retain him on a futures deal – something which was far from automatic with the players on the practice squad at the end of the season.\n\nWith his combination of length and athleticism, Mathis has looked like a player who would really benefit from adding some strength and refining his technique. He’s been in the league long enough now that he needs to make an impact in camp or preseason for the organization to be compelled to keep him in their plans.",

    "description": "The New York Giants formally introduced John Harbaugh as their head coach on Tuesday, and here are nine takeaways from his press conference.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants formally introduced John Harbaugh as the 21st head coach in franchise history on Tuesday afternoon at the Quest Diagnostics Training Center in East Rutherford.\n\nThe press conference, held inside the fieldhouse, was a well-attended event, featuring the Mara, Tisch, and Koch families, as well as the Harbaugh family, general manager Joe Schoen, current and former Giants players, and an abundance of reporters.\n\nHarbaugh was introduced by Schoen and then fielded questions for roughly 20 minutes.\n\nHere are nine takeaways from the Harbaugh introductory press conference.\n\nLeading up to Harbaugh signing his contract, many reports indicated that the reporting structure served as a main cog in negotiations. In the end, Schoen and the Giants agreed that Harbaugh would report directly to ownership -- namely, CEO John Mara.\n\nHowever, Harbaugh appeared to dismiss that on Tuesday, calling the reports \"overblown.\"\n\n\"It's really not that important,\" he said. \"It's overblown just a little bit in terms of how it works... We all report to the boss, right? And the boss is ownership. And John Mara is running football operations -- and he's running it -- and I'm glad he is.\"\n\nHarbaugh made it abundantly clear that everything will be football-focused under his leadership. And while that may sound like an obvious statement, the Giants have found ways to get a bit distracted in recent years.\n\n\"To me, the number one thing is that we have to have guys that love football,\" he said. \"It's football. What are we here for? What do we do? What is this building here for? It's football.\"\n\nHarbaugh noted that everyone on the team had better love all aspects of football, from weightlifting to practice to film study, and if they don't, they can go play somewhere else.\n\nHarbaugh mentioned his father, Jack Harbaugh, several times throughout the press conference, attributing several quotes and processes to his old man.\n\nJohn Harbaugh was asked what he sees when he looks at the Giants' roster and he says his dad told him he was impressed by what he saw from the team on tape:\n\n\"When my dad told me, I knew it was true.\" pic.twitter.com/qUPBJH5w2I\n\n— Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) January 20, 2026\n\nDespite reports that several candidates had reservations about Schoen -- including Harbaugh himself -- the head coach came away \"impressed\" after multiple conversations with the GM.\n\n\"You get to know Joe, and we started talking ball, and what you see is a football man. This guy lives and breathes football,\" Harbaugh said. \"His knowledge is deep. He knows the league. . . He was impressive to me.\"\n\nHarbaugh went on to describe their conversations as a \"joy.\"\n\nHarbaugh has not shied away from what he expects of these Giants, and that's winning on Day 1 with sights set on another Super Bowl championship... And then several more.\n\n\"I know the challenges, and I understand the expectations. And I know the fans are hungry for a winner,\" he said. \"We're here with one mission: To earn the right to be called World Champions in New York.\"\n\n\"I'm planning on Day 1. That's what we'll be shooting for, working for... I fully expect it to happen.\"\n\nWhen Harbaugh spoke, you could hear some of Tom Coughlin in his messaging. He shares a similar mindset, which is what fans and players have been yearning for since Coughlin walked out the door a decade ago.\n\n\"Nothing will be taken for granted. It will always, always be all about the team. The team, the team, the team,\" he said. \"It will always be about that. Now it's time to go to work.\"\n\nHarbaugh doesn't just want the Giants to win; he wants them to dismantle and overwhelm opponents for 60 full minutes every single week.\n\n\"Our focus is simple: It starts with building a team that is physical and tough; that is capable of overwhelming their opponent from beginning to end -- especially at the end,\" he said. \"That understands how to finish; that is smart and disciplined. That plays the game the way it should be played. And that everybody watching it -- including those playing it -- would be proud of.\n\nThese are not the New York Giants; they are the New York Football Giants.\n\n\"The New York FOOTBALL Giants\" pic.twitter.com/j7VQ9D0S9Z\n\n— Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) January 20, 2026\n\n\"It's a profound honor to be entrusted with the responsibility of coaching the New York Giants Football Giants,\" he said. \"My Dad taught me that they were the New York Football Giants. They weren't just the Giants, they were the New York Football Giants.\"\n\nHarbaugh was comfortable at the podium, and he offered very little fluff. It was 20-plus minutes of pure substance, with one single quote coming across as the most important.\n\n\"I want this job,\" Harbaugh said emphatically.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 9 takeaways from Giants coach John Harbaugh's introductory press conference",

    "fullText": "Robert Saleh’s impending tenure as Tennessee Titans head coach comes with an unusual wrinkle for the franchise: He plans to call defensive plays himself, a responsibility he did not carry as head coach of the New York Jets.\n\nNew #Titans HC Robert Saleh indicated to teams in interviews that he plans to call defensive plays in his next stop as HC, per sources. \n\nThat wasn’t the case in his #Jets tenure. https://t.co/9hjhYCjkh7 pic.twitter.com/TtdMqrn1AA\n\n— Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) January 20, 2026\n\nSaleh’s decision to take on defensive play-calling signals that he wants more direct control of the side of the ball that has defined his career. As San Francisco’s defensive coordinator, Saleh built a reputation as a top defensive mind, and Tennessee clearly hopes to lean on that expertise to upgrade a defense that struggled with consistency last season.\n\nBut Saleh’s choice also raises the stakes on his offensive coordinator hire.\n\nWith Saleh focused on defense, Tennessee must land a top-tier offensive play-caller -- not only to manage game strategy but to help develop rookie quarterback Cam Ward, the 2025 No. 1 overall pick.\n\nWard showed promise as a rookie, but his continued growth likely hinges on having an OC who can design and call an effective offense. Saleh’s expanded role gives him control where he’s strongest, but success in Nashville will depend on pairing that with elite offensive leadership.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Robert Saleh plans to call defensive plays with Tennessee Titans",

    "fullText": "(This Jan 17 story has been repeated with no changes to text)\n\nNEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has asked a New ​York federal judge to deny a request by two lawmakers seeking an appointment ‌of a special master to monitor the public release of records tied to the late financier and ‌convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Justice Department since December has been releasing caches of documents tied to its investigations of Epstein. But U.S. Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie have criticized the department's slow pace.\n\nKhanna, a California Democrat, and Massie, a Kentucky Republican, last week ⁠said they asked U.S. District ‌Judge Paul Engelmayer to permit them to file a brief that would argue for the appointment of a special master and independent ‍monitor, given the Justice Department's failure to fully comply with a law that requires the DOJ to release all records related to Epstein by December 19.\n\nIn a six-page letter filed on Friday ​to U.S. District Court Judge Paul Engelmayer on Friday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi ‌and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche argued that Khanna and Thomas Massie are not parties to the U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell case involving Epstein and should not be allowed to file a friend of the court request in the matter.\n\n\"Representatives Khanna and Massie do not have standing, their stated objectives are in-consistent with the role of an amicus ⁠as well as the role of the Court, ​and, in any event, there is no authority ​permitting the Court to grant the Representatives the relief they improperly seek,\" the DOJ said in the letter signed by Jay Clayton, US attorney ‍for the Southern District ⁠of New York.\n\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.\n\nThe Justice Department said at the end of 2025 that it had ⁠5.2 million pages of Epstein files left to review and needs 400 lawyers from four different department ‌offices to help with the process through late January.",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets announced they have interviewed eight candidates to fill their defensive coordinator vacancy. Head coach Aaron Glenn will soon make a decision to appoint Steve Wilks' successor. Among the options, Detroit Lions assistant Jim O'Neil could emerge as the favorite.\n\nO'Neil has two advantages working in his favor. He's the only candidate on the list to possess previous experience with Coach Glenn. He's also just one of two candidates, alongside Wink Martindale, to have previously coordinated a defense in the NFL.\n\nLet's break them down into 2 categories:\n\nWorked previously with Aaron Glenn: Jim O'Neil (current Lions def asst/safeties coach)\n\nPrevious NFL DC experience: O'Neil (Cle, SF), Wink Martindale (Balt, NYG).

He also knows the Jets and AFC East well. O'Neil actually worked for the Jets from 2009-2012 under Rex Ryan, and later worked for the Buffalo Bills in 2013.\n\nO'Neil then coordinated the Cleveland Browns' defense in 2014-15, and then again for the San Francisco 49ers in 2016. The Browns fielded a top-10 scoring defense under O'Neil in 2014, but regressed to 29th in 2015. His 49ers defense in 2016 was the worst in the league, allowing 30 points per contest.\n\nThe Jets have a mixture of intriguing candidates. Ranging from veterans like O'Neil and Martindale to Jim Leonhard and DeMarcus Covington, Glenn has a decision to make. Glenn's familiarity with O'Neil could play a role.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Is Jim O'Neil emerging as Jets' defensive coordinator favorite?",

    "fullText": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is getting the message: He’s vulnerable to the same quick hit that President Trump ordered to pluck Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro from power and toss him into custody in New York.\n\nThe brazen Jan. 3 raid on Caracas by U.S. forces almost certainly struck more fear into the potbellied dictator than any military drills or aerial shows of force ever could. In doing so, it’s also ramped up the risks of a potential nuclear showdown as Kim goes into panic mode, triggered by the same American president who has routinely boasted of the pair’s “very good relationship.”\n\n“The operation to ‘rendition’ the president of Venezuela demonstrates the capabilities that have to be of concern to North Korea,” says Sydney Seiler, former national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council. The word “rendition,” as used by Seiler, is CIA-speak for capturing an enemy operative and sending him elsewhere for prosecution, or even torture and killing.\n\nThe other key word is “decapitation,” which Kim is well aware the Americans have been practicing in annual military exercises for years. “What’s appealing is that decapitation is the quickest way to terminate a conflict,” Seiler, who visited North Korea on negotiating teams before the North cut off all communications after the failure of Kim’s meetings with Trump in 2019, told the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n“Decapitation would be helpful in trying to deter North Korea,” Seiler believes. “Without Kim Jong Un,” he notes, North Korea would have no leader, no one who would know how to lead its outsized, underfed armed forces of 1.2 million troops, much less anyone in charge of its nuclear program.\n\nKim betrayed his deepest fears of a plot like the fracas in Caracas by authorizing release for North Korean audiences of a film all about the capture of Maduro. The film “Days and Nights of Confrontation,” could not have aired on North Korean state TV at a more propitious moment, days after elite U.S. troops seized Maduro and his wife. The message is clear: what’s to stop the Americans from repeating themselves in North Korea?\n\nThe film epitomizes “the trend of racy, Hollywood-style content aimed at appealing to young people,” says a South Korean website, NK News, that tracks North Korea. “Surely Mr. Kim and his family, including his fiery younger sister Yo-Jong, and his beloved teenage daughter, Ju-ae, would make great targets.” In one fell swoop the Americans could wipe out the dynasty that Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, founded when the Soviet Union installed him as leader of the northern half of the divided Korean peninsula after the Japanese surrender in 1945.\n\nCapturing Kim is not a new idea for American “rendition” experts.\n\n“Some White House aides believed his death would paralyze his country,” writes Joel Wit, who also joined negotiating teams to North Korea, inspecting the nuclear site at Yongbyon north of Pyongyang after North Korea signed an agreement in 1994 to stop producing nukes. “Go get Kim Jong Un, we were postured to do that,” says Wit in his tell-all book, Fallout: The Inside Story of America’s Failure to Disarm North Korea. One official is quoted as saying: “Everyone, including the North Koreans, knew killing him as part of the war plan.”\n\nMaybe the U.S. would have to marshal more than the 150 or so aircraft, and a few hundred troops, including the U.S. Army’s elite Delta Force, that were needed to grab Maduro, but Kim is well aware his family and entourage could be hustled aboard a helicopter bound for an American warship long before the Russians and Chinese could respond in support of North Korea’s military establishment, ill-fed, ill-trained and not at all ready to leap to their leader’s instant defense.\n\nIf capturing Kim sounds like mission impossible, consider his frequent appearances inspecting industrial and agricultural projects, reviewing troops, and presiding at ceremonies. He also shows up periodically at missile launches, perhaps the best time of all to catch him just as he’s making a show of pressing the button. The Americans, moreover, are steeped in the knowledge of what it will take to get him. U.S. forces have been training for years to go after him. Annual U.S.-South Korean exercises once routinely wound up with a mock “decapitation” of “the North Korean leader,” without explicitly naming Kim.\n\nThe U.S. command in Korea dropped the word “decapitation” from the war games in deference to their South Korean ally, who reminded them such language might not help in attempts at fruitless talks with the North Koreans, who now refuse to talk anyway. The word is gaining currency again with Maduro’s capture—while raising the question in Pyongyang of who might come next on the American hit list.\n\n“North Korea’s Kim expected to cling to [his] nuclear security blanket after Venezuela,” blared one headline in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. “The United States’ decapitation operation against Venezuela will reinforce North Korea’s nuclear ambitions,” read another. That warning should prompt Trump to act quickly to get rid of a nuisance who’s been plaguing the region for years with bombastic harangues, threatening his enemies with a nuclear holocaust while his own people suffer from hunger and disease.\n\nFlights of heavy American bombers do little or nothing to remove the threats posed by America’s foes. Kim knows he can laugh off another aerial show of intimidation or a useless meeting with Trump. The threat of a Maduro-style capture is far more effective. Kim’s worst fear is that the Americans, after rehearsing “decapitation” for years, will decide it’s time to finally put their plan into effect, stifling Asia’s leading terrorist just as suddenly as they whisked Maduro and his wife off to jail in New York.",

    "fullText": "If you have been hoping for a $2,000 tariff rebate check, it may not come.\n\nPresident Donald Trump gave mixed messages about the issues in a recent interview with The New York Times.\n\n\"You've promised $2,000 checks to Americans based off of your tariff revenues. When can they expect those?\" Times reporter Katie Rogers asked.\n\n\"I did do that? When did I do that?\" Trump said. \"Yeah, I'm thinking. Well, I did $1,776 for the military.\"\n\nWhen Tyler Pager, another Times journalist, followed up, asking when the checks would come, Trump replied that \"the tariff money is so substantial.\"\n\n\"That's coming in, that I'll be able to do $2,000 sometime,\" Trump said. \"I would say toward the end of the year.\"\n\nIn November, Trump posted on Truth Social proposing a $2,000 payout to all US citizens with low or middle incomes, because the government is \"taking in so much money\" from tariffs. According to a recent Supreme Court filing, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent estimated that the federal government may have collected around $1 trillion in tariffs.\n\n\"People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!\" Trump posted on Truth Social on November 9. \"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.\"\n\nEven if the Supreme Court doesn't rule his tariffs enacted under emergency powers unconstitutional in its coming decision, revenue generated by the duties may be spread too thin for a payout to Americans.\n\nLater in the interview with the Times, Trump said that the tariff revenue will go toward reducing federal government debt and funding national defense.\n\nAccording to the Treasury, the national debt as of January is around $38.40 trillion, and rose by $2.17 trillion in 2025. If Bessent's estimate on tariff revenue is correct, the total amount collected over the past year would cover less than 50% of the increase in debt.\n\nTrump also recently called for increasing the defense budget to $1.5 trillion for the fiscal year 2027. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the move would add $5.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.\n\nTrump has promised or suggested a number of payouts to Americans in his second term, including a $5,000 DOGE check, a $10,000 bonus for air traffic controllers with perfect attendance during the government shutdown, $1,000 to Trump Accounts for children who are citizens, and a $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" for active military members.\n\nAs for whether Trump even has the power to issue the checks, Congress, not the presidency, has the power of the purse and can make those appropriations.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
