    "fullText": "Ex-NBA star Enes Kanter Freedom piled on to the often-conservative criticism of freestyle skiing great Eileen Gu on Wednesday.\n\nGu, whose mother is Chinese, was born in San Francisco but is representing China for the second straight Winter Olympics.\n\nPolitics: Trump's Latest Epstein Denial Has Critics Asking New Questions\n\nShe has earned China two silver medals in the Milan Cortina Games with the halfpipe up next. She won two golds and a silver in 2022. She has vaulted to international fame as an athlete and sometimes a model, reportedly earning tens of millions of dollars a year ― a chunk of which she has received from the Chinese government.\n\nBut as in the last Winter Olympics, Gu has gotten heat for her choice, though it should be noted that several U.S.-born athletes compete for other countries. Brazil’s Lucas Pinheiro Braathen, who was born in Oslo but has a Brazilian mother, has been widely celebrated during the Games for representing a country other than his birthplace. Gu’s defenders have suggested that racism and Sinophobia are factors in why she is being treated differently.\n\n“I’m just going to say it. She’s a traitor,” Freedom told Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Wednesday. “She was born in America. She was raised in America, lives in America, and chooses to compete against her own country for, literally, the worst human rights abuser on the planet, China. She built her fame in a free country, and then chooses to represent an authoritarian regime.”\n\nKanter Freedom: Eileen Gu Is a traitor. She was born in America and chooses to compete against her own country. pic.twitter.com/gAh4YbrFpt\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) February 18, 2026\n\nThe former center, who played for the Utah Jazz, New York Knicks and other teams in the NBA from 2011 to 2022, added “Freedom” to his name when he became a U.S. citizen in 2021. The former Turkish citizen was outspoken against the Turkish government and had his passport canceled by the country in 2017. He often speaks out against human rights abuses in China.\n\nBefore the Games, Gu defended her choice to represent China.\n\nPolitics: Money And Power Converge As CBS Becomes Trump State Media\n\n“The U.S. already has the representation,” Gu said, per Newsweek. “I like building my own pond.”\n\nShe also dismissed speculation that she chose China because the financial windfall was potentially greater.\n\n“I’m glad that there’s enough money in the sport now for people to think that’s a consideration,” Gu said.\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nEven Vice President JD Vance weighed in about Gu’s decision, starting off diplomatically but eventually throwing some shade her way.\n\nAsked by Fox News’ Martha MacCallum on Tuesday if the status of the San Francisco-born athlete should be “changed,” the veep replied: “Well, look, I have no idea what her status should be. I think that’s ultimately up to the Olympics Committee. I won’t pretend to wade into that.”\n\nPolitics: Homeland Security Flack Tricia McLaughlin Set To Leave Trump Administration\n\n“I certainly think that somebody who grew up in the United States of America, who benefited from our education system, from the freedoms and liberties that make this country a great place, I would hope that they want to compete with the United States of America,” he added.\n\n“So, I’m going to root for American athletes, and I think part of that is people who identify themselves as Americans. That’s who I’m rooting for this Olympics,” Vance said.\n\nFox News Host Asks Vance If U.S.-Born Olympian Should Lose ‘Status’ Skiing For China\n\nOlympian's *** Confession Spreads To Another Sport In Wild 'Late Show' Send-Up\n\nItaly Taunts U.S. In Oh-So-Familiar Style After Winning Speedskating Team Event",

    "description": "The Trump administration is disputing a new paper from the New York Federal Reserve that asserts US consumers and businesses are bearing the bulk of the higher costs from tariffs imposed last year.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is disputing a new paper from the New York Federal Reserve asserting that US consumers and businesses are bearing the bulk of the higher costs from tariffs imposed last year.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think it's the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve System. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion, which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan, based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class.\"\n\nWhat percentage of tariff costs did US consumers bear?\n\nHow did the Trump administration respond to the study?\n\nWhat did the NY Fed study find about tariff costs?\n\nHow did tariff pass-through rates change throughout 2025?\n\nAuthors Mary Amiti, head of labor and product markets at the New York Fed's Research and Statistics Group, along with research analyst Chris Flanagan and research economist Sebastian Heise, analyzed the tariffs instituted last year and found that 94% were borne by the US in the first eight months of 2025. Just 6% of those costs were absorbed by foreign exporters.\n\nThe analysis covered 12-month changes from January 2024 through November 2025 (the most recent available data). The analysis also noted how the pass-through of costs changed over the course of 2025. For instance, by November, the pass-through of costs borne in the US had declined to 86%.\n\nThe authors said their results show that a 10% tariff led to only a 0.6 percentage-point decline in foreign export prices. But they also found that the tariff pass-through into import prices declined later last year, as more exporters bore the costs of tariffs. In November, a 10% tariff was associated with a 1.4% decline in foreign export prices, though still an 86% pass-through to US import prices.\n\nThe authors said the higher import prices caused firms to reorganize their supply chains.\n\n\"In sum, U.S. firms and consumers continue to bear the bulk of the economic burden of the high tariffs imposed in 2025,\" the authors wrote.\n\nHassett maintains that tariffs affect a multitude of price factors, including supply and demand, which shift around consumer and producer surpluses.\n\n\"They’re basically only looking at changes in prices,\" Hassett said.\n\nHe pointed to other metrics, such as lower inflation and higher wages, which suggest consumers are better off.\n\n\"Incomes are up way more than the cost of living, and that's the real wage gain that this silly Fed study neglects to mention,\" Hassett said.",

    "title": "Why Berkshire Hathaway's New York Times bet is a fitting end to the Warren Buffett era",
    "description": "Warren Buffett went from delivering newspapers to owning dozens of them. Berkshire Hathaway bought a New York Times stake in his final quarter as CEO.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought one new stock in his last quarter as CEO: The New York Times Company. It's a fitting final bet for the Buffett era.\n\nThe famed investor's conglomerate scooped up around 5.1 million shares of the newspaper publisher, securing a stake worth $352 million at December's close, a Tuesday filing revealed.\n\nThe position's small size points to one of Buffett's two investment managers at the time — Ted Weschler and the since-departed Todd Combs — making the purchase.\n\nBuffett is a lifelong lover of newspapers. He delivered 500,000 papers as a teenager running multiple routes, and for years, he challenged shareholders to best him at newspaper tossing during Berkshire's annual meetings.\n\nHe went from throwing newspapers to owning dozens of publishers, including The Buffalo News and The Omaha World-Herald. He was close friends with the late publisher of The Washington Post, Katharine Graham, and one of the paper's biggest financial backers.\n\nDuring Berkshire's 2010 meeting, he recalled looking at the circulation of major titles such as the San Francisco Chronicle, and said it \"blows your mind how fast people are dropping it.\"\n\n\"The world has really changed, in terms of the essential nature of newspapers,\" he said.\n\nIn 1965 or 1970, there was \"probably nothing looked more bulletproof than a daily newspaper where the competition had melted away,\" he continued. \"But it's a form of distributing information and entertainment that has lost its immediacy in many cases.\"\n\nBuffett pointed out that people no longer rely on papers to find out how their stocks were performing, or whether their sports team won. The resulting decline in circulation made newspapers less attractive to advertisers, he noted.\n\n\"And so you get this chicken and egg thing that the newspaper becomes less valuable as the advertisers float away, and the advertisers float away as the subscribers diminish,\" he said.\n\nDespite his concerns, he acquired 28 daily papers in the early 2010s.\n\n\"Charlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly-bound communities and having a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time,\" Buffett wrote in his 2012 letter to shareholders. \"Charlie\" referred to his late business partner, Charlie Munger.\n\n\"Newspapers continue to reign supreme ... in the delivery of local news,\" he added.\n\nBuffett struck a far more bearish tone in 2019, telling Yahoo Finance that he expected only a few national titles, such as The New York Times, to survive, while the rest would \"disappear.\" He also bemoaned the demise of the newspaper ad business.\n\n\"It went from monopoly to franchise to competitive to ... toast,\" he said.\n\nBuffett offloaded Berkshire's newspapers to publisher Lee Enterprises in 2020. Given his long history in the newspaper business and eventual exit from it, it's striking to see Berkshire return with its recent stock purchase.\n\nOne reason was undoubtedly The New York Times' recovery in recent years. It grew revenues by 9% to $2.8 billion and its net income by 17% to $344 million last year, as subscription revenues rose 9% and advertising revenues jumped 12%.\n\nA key driver was the paper's addition of 1.4 million digital-only subscribers, which lifted its total subscriber count to 12.78 million as of December 31.\n\nThe publisher's stock price has already seen some of the benefits. After collapsing from over $50 in mid-2002 to below $5 in early 2009, it has surged roughly 15-fold — including 50% in the past year — to trade at a record high of $74 at Tuesday's close.\n\nThe shares gained another 3% in Wednesday's premarket, perhaps marking one of the final cases of the \"Buffett Effect,\" where other investors mimic his buys and sells, moving markets.\n\nThe publisher's comeback might explain why Buffett and his team decided to revisit one of his favorite industries so soon after turning the page.",

    "description": "Levittown in Long Island, New York, was built in 1947 as a suburban community for America's growing families. Here's what it was like in the '50s.",
    "fullText": "As World War II came to an end, families looked for ways to start over. Emboldened by the GI Bill's provisions for home loans, they moved out of the cities in droves for newly developed suburban communities.\n\nIn fact, the suburbs expanded by 47% during the 1950s, according to the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History.\n\nLevittown in Long Island, New York, was one of the first to introduce the idea of a pre-planned, mass-produced uniform suburban community, The New York Times reported. Families started moving there on October 1, 1947.\n\nThough the community welcomed an influx of families, non-white prospects weren't allowed. Notably, African Americans didn't see the same benefits from the GI Bill, and it would take some years before racial and ethnic minorities broadly shifted to the suburbs.\n\nHere's what it was like to live in America's first modern suburb in the 1950s.\n\nAt the time, most people lived close to the city center to work in factories, or they lived in rural communities to work on farms, according to economist Jay Zagorsky.\n\nThe 1950 Census found that 60% of people lived in cities, while 40% lived in the suburbs.\n\nThanks to factors like the construction of highways, the development of new neighborhoods from farmland, and even safety in the event of an atomic attack, these percentages would soon shift drastically.\n\nThe GI Bill provided each returning soldier with benefits designed to stimulate economic growth. Each soldier was given a year of unemployment and free tuition to go to college. The military pledged to back all home loans, which allowed veterans to buy houses with little to no down payments.\n\nShortly after WWII ended, the Baby Boom began. In 1946, 3.4 million babies were born, more than ever before, and 20% more than in 1945, per History.com. This trend continued into the '50s.\n\nMost historians think it was because Americans were eager to have families after having postponed marriage and childbirth because of the Great Depression and World War II.\n\nWhatever the reason, people flocked to the suburbs to accommodate their growing families.\n\nDuring the war, factories focused on creating wartime essentials, like airplanes and barracks. In the '50s, they refocused their efforts on building home components and automobiles using the new practices — like the assembly line — they implemented in the war,\n\nAs a result, factories were able to produce materials for homes faster than ever before.\n\nLevitt and Sons, a construction company, purchased a 7-square-mile plot of potato and onion farms in Long Island in 1947. They set out to build one of the first uniform suburban communities in the US.\n\nTo construct the new community, which sits about 30 miles east of Manhattan, Levitt and Sons hired mostly unskilled workers to build the homes. They gave each a specific skill and created a sort of human assembly line. William Levitt even called his firm \"the General Motors of the housing industry,\" The Guardian reported.\n\nThe Levitts eventually constructed 17,447 houses between 1947 and 1951. During the peak of the construction boom, one was built every 16 minutes.\n\nThe first homes in Levittown cost new residents around $7,000, The Guardian reported. For veterans, there was no down payment.\n\nWhen adjusting for inflation, a Levittown home in 1950 would be roughly $97,000 in today's money.\n\nAt first, all the homes were built in the same style, and some residents even admitted to walking into the wrong house at times because they couldn't tell them apart, according to Khan Academy, citing Kenneth T. Jackson's \"Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States.\"\n\nEach home in Levittown sat on a 6,000-square-foot lot, The New York Times reported.\n\nWith the growing number of children, outdoor spaces became increasingly important to the suburban neighborhood.\n\nAt first, they were modest homes, but most families saw their new suburban lives as luxurious.\n\nMany Levittown homeowners learned homeownership responsibilities, such as tending to a lawn.\n\nThe suburb helped cement the idea of the \"nuclear family\" in American culture.\n\nThere were also swimming pools that children could use during the summer.\n\nSince the streets in the suburban neighborhood were considered safer than those in the city, parents used to allow children to bike around by themselves, per the National Center for Safe Routes to School.\n\nThe mortgage on a home in Levittown was reportedly about $29 per month, while most paid $90 per month in the city.\n\nThe community has over 17,000 homes, making it one of the largest private housing projects in the history of the US.\n\nSuburban home construction boomed in the 1950s. In fact, at least 15 million units were under construction by the end of the decade, according to the Wealth Management Group.\n\nFor years, there were rules that restricted minorities from buying homes in Levittown, and even as the Civil Rights Movement was starting to take form and the rest of the country began integrating after Brown v Board of Education in 1954, Levittown remained mostly white.\n\nTwo-thirds of Levittown residents today are white, according US Census estimates.\n\nIn 1952, William Cotter, a Black man, and his family, sublet a home at 26 Butternut Lane. When the lease was up, Levitt refused to renew it or sell them the home.\n\nThe refusal sparked support for the Cotters, and the family eventually purchased another home from a white homeowner.\n\nThe suburban boom corresponded with the expansion of interstate highways in the US, starting the modern iteration of the commute from the suburbs to the city.\n\nIn 1950, 80% of men in Levittown commuted to Manhattan for work, The Guardian reported.\n\nWhen men left to fight in WWII, women began entering the workforce, gaining newfound independence and freedom. However, they were suddenly expected to give this up again and instead focus on childbearing and rearing.\n\nIn 1963, author Betty Friedan wrote in \"The Feminine Mystique\" that the suburbs \"were burying women alive.\" However, some believe that women's dissatisfaction with staying home \"contributed to the rebirth of the feminist movement in the 1960s,\" History.com reported.\n\nIn 1959, women of Levittown, with children in hand, protested in favor of putting stop signs in an area with automobile-related deaths.\n\nAs American politics increasingly centered on anticommunism and Cold War tensions rose, Levittown and suburbs like it took on a symbolic meaning in American culture, representing prosperity and the \"American Dream.\"\n\nLevitt was once quoted saying, \"No man who owns his own house and lot can be a Communist. He has too much to do.\"\n\nIn 2026, Levittown is still a sizable community with a population of about 50,000. Though it's full of modern businesses and technology, the community still holds a legacy as a post-war suburban haven.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe shortstop position is one of the top talking points surrounding the New York Yankees, as Anthony Volpe hasn’t been great. One proposed deal looks to address the position with a major shake-up.\n\nIn a mock deal from Thomas Carelli of Sports Illustrated, New York would land infielder CJ Abrams from the Washington Nationals in a swap centered on both MLB talents and prospect capital.\n\nNationals receive: Volpe, Bryce Cunningham, Prospect to be named\n\n“Yankees fans are absolutely fed up with Volpe. As for now, Jose Caballero is the listed starting shortstop. This is due to Volpe's injury, but still, not great,” Carelli wrote.\n\nFrom an offensive standpoint, Abrams is a lot better of a player than Volpe, but to say that he doesn't have his issues on both sides of the baseball would be a bit unfair, as he's good but not great.\n\nCarelli did acknowledge Volpe’s defensive value, but questioned his long-term position of staying in the Bronx. With Volpe set to start the season on the IR due to offseason shoulder surgery, there's a possibility that if Jose Caballero plays well enough, he won't have a place to play on this team.\n\n“Volpe can still be good — he was a Gold Glove.

While Goldschmidt isn’t what he once was at this stage of his career, neither is Castellanos, and Goldschmidt doesn’t come with the attitude that the former Phillies outfielder does.\n\nWhile Castellanos’ power profile may have intrigued the Yankees on paper, there’s not much to say about him at this stage of his career. He also wasn’t content with his role and that’s something the Yankees shouldn’t have wanted to deal with.\n\n\"A lot of times when a good player has their role change with the club, it can cause some friction, and his role changed last year from where it was,\" Dave Dombrowski said. \"I mean you played every single day for a lot years in a row, and so sometimes that can contribute to it.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSpring Training check-ins are underway across camp, and New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone offered an encouraging early update on slugger Giancarlo Stanton.\n\nSpeaking with reporters, including Randy Miller of NJ.com, Boone had very promising words to say about Stanton, who has dealt with many injuries throughout his time in the Bronx.\n\n“I think he’s doing great,” Boone said of Stanton. “I haven’t seen him yet. He’s one of the guys that will get here. But he’s had a good winter. He’s ready to roll.”\n\nStanton’s health has been a recurring storyline in recent seasons, making any positive offseason news a good thing as the Yankees prepare for the regular season.\n\nBoone also made it clear that, even with Stanton feeling well, the team will stick to its usual approach early in camp and try not to overdo it.\n\n“I don’t expect any limitations. I usually slow-play him into games in spring, so you might not see him that first week.”\n\nThat ramp-up stuff has been normal for Stanton, as it allows him to build himself up without getting hurt doing something that’s ultimately useless.\n\nIf the early outlook continues on, the Yankees could enter the season with one of their top power bats fully available, a key factor for a lineup looking to not only score a lot of runs, but also hit home runs and win the American League.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies almost got bailed out of Nick Castellanos situation by historic team in American League\n\nNew York Yankees almost made a $20 million mistake but decided to sign Paul Goldschmidt instead\n\nBoston Red Sox trade idea finally moves on from Triston Casas after two years of rumors\n\nNew York Yankees trade proposal sends Anthony Volpe to lousy NL team for 25-year-old All-Star shortstop\n\nNew York Yankees trade pitch lands another proven veteran and the price is cheaper than most would think\n\nAtlanta Braves trade proposal swaps Ozzie Albies with best hitter at position in Major League Baseball",

    "fullText": "Broncos have to be out on Breece Hall if Jets make predicted move originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos should make a concerted effort to upgrade the running back position this offseason. When they examine the free-agent market, the top name that should stand out is that of New York Jets running back Breece Hall.\n\nAs I have stated previously, Hall is the running back the Broncos should go all out to get ahead of the 2026 NFL season. He is a true three-down back; he fits what Sean Payton likes to do to a tee and he is still only 24 years old.\n\nHowever, his current team, the New York Jets, could foil any plans the Broncos may have of obtaining him.\n\nRecently, Adam Schefter of ESPN put together a list of players who could get the franchise tag placed on them, and Hall is one of those guys. Though the franchise tag doesn't shut down talks of a player moving on from that team, it makes it much more difficult to get them away from that team, and that was the purpose of the franchise tag in the first place.\n\nShould the Jets apply the tag to Hall, it would likely mean he would play at least the 2026 season with the Jets and it would allow the team extra time to come up with a long-term deal to keep him there much longer. If a team like the Broncos wanted to acquire him at that point, it would require giving up multiple first-round picks.\n\nIt would essentially end any thought the team may have of adding Hall to its offensive backfield. Instead, the Broncos would have to look at other options. Fortunately, there are plenty.\n\nWould Breece Hall be the missing piece on the Broncos offense to win a Super Bowl? | @TroyRenck@EricGoodman#BroncosCountry\n\nSponsored by https://t.co/ta6du3zyQx & https://t.co/7GdKA7T5Itpic.twitter.com/nWcwYPPDcz\n\n— Troy Renck (@TroyRenck) February 18, 2026\n\nKenneth Walker III was just named MVP of Super Bowl LX and Rico Dowdle is coming off a strong season with the Carolina Panthers. They are both scheduled to be unrestricted free agents. A more cost-friendly option, and one that would make plenty of sense, would be to grab Atlanta Falcons running back Tyler Allgeier.\n\nFinally, the Broncos could look at re-signing J.K. Dobbins and putting a lot of faith in him staying healthy. That would be a bit of a gamble, but the team does have options.\n\nMORE:Broncos not named as potential landing spot for Tyreek Hill following Dolphins release\n\nFor Broncos fans who were hoping to land Hall, they will have to hope that the Jets choose not to tag him. However, it would make sense for a Jets team that is looking to turn its fortunes around to make sure it keeps its best offensive player in the fold.\n\nBroncos may be getting an idea of cost for A.J.

    "description": "I visited a huge toy fair in NYC to find the next hot new trend. Labubus are over. Next up for kids and the young at heart? The highland cow.",
    "fullText": "I'm calling it: If you haven't already, you're going to start seeing highland cows in toy aisles around the country.\n\nAfter visiting one of the industry's largest fairs earlier this week, I think I'm qualified to say: The shaggy cow is taking over as the hot new animal for plush toys.\n\nIf you've been paying attention to toys — or if you have kids — you probably already know capybaras are big, but they've been the hot thing for more than a year now. Same with axolotls, the eerily cute pink salamanders. Those trends are peaking, though.\n\nStuffed animals seem to go in trend cycles. In the mid-2010s, llamas and owls were all over baby and kids' clothes and toys. Before that, hedgehogs and foxes.\n\nNot everyone I talked to at the Toy Fair, the toy industry convention held in New York over Presidents Day weekend, agreed with my assessment. I got a few other surprising predictions:\n\nBut enough people I asked said the same thing — that the trending animal is the highland cow, with its caramel fur and tawny mop of hair — that I feel I can say there's a modest consensus.\n\nLike I said, not everyone agreed on the cow. But there was agreement, among everyone I talked to, about three things casting a long shadow over the toy business: tariffs, TikTok, and Labubus.\n\nI chatted with several small to midsize toy companies who said that the tariffs that began when President Donald Trump declared \"Liberation Day\" have hurt their businesses. One plush toy maker said they're paying $10,000 extra per container in tariff charges for their high-end plush animals made in the Philippines. They haven't raised prices yet, and the new fees just eat into their profit. Another plush maker said that they raised prices once after tariffs, but are trying to avoid another hike.\n\nToy makers' ears must've been burning when Trump made comments about how perhaps kids could learn to live with just a few dolls instead of many. But Trump was right about something — kids do often have more toys now than they did 30 years ago because toys are, in fact, cheaper than ever.\n\nThe rate of inflation for toys is well below the national average for all things, meaning a Barbie or Hot Wheel costs relatively less today than it did back in 1995. (If you're a parent looking at a mess of toys spilling out of boxes and shelves, you're not alone.) Part of the reason toys have gotten cheaper is overseas manufacturing, which the tariffs are now hitting.\n\nThe big toy brands like Barbie, Lego, and Pokémon all had new items to debut at the fair. Among the smaller toy brands, a few trends emerged — blind boxes were huge, and many brands and distributors had cute figurines packaged in blind boxes or adopted the aesthetic of twee characters sold alongside Labubus at the Hong Kong-based retailer Pop Mart.\n\nStill, no one seemed to think there was a clear heir apparent to Labubus, which were a singular meteoric event in the toy world (yes, there have been viral toys before, like Beanie Babies or Tickle-Me-Elmos, but the rapid internet and celebrity-fueled Labubu phenomenon feels unique).\n\n\"Labubu is such a great example of something from nothing, but really built on the foundation of everything. Blind boxes have been massive. Plush has been massive. It was the amalgamation of a ton of the listening, and it then getting discovered,\" said Eric Morse, VP of new business initiatives at Spirit Halloween said during a panel talk about Gen Alpha trends.\n\nMorse went on to explain they used a similar strategy for rushing out \"K-Pop Demon Hunters\" costumes this October after the surprise hit debuted on Netflix over the summer. (Of course, even though they pushed through a licensed costume at a far faster speed than normal, they still sold out well before Halloween, much to the ire of 8-year-olds everywhere.) \"How we view the business is listen first, execute second,\" Morse said.\n\nWhen toy and candy trends happen rapidly on TikTok, it can be hard to predict surges in demand. And with on-again, off-again tariffs, it's even harder to plan, lots of industry insiders told me. That's something I kept hearing from all the vendors I talked with: uncertainty.\n\nBut one thing I feel confident about is highland cows. You heard it here first, folks.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhile the New York Mets have taken strides in rebuilding their team after losing key superstars, they still haven’t addressed a couple issues. One of those issues is that while they’ve replaced the offense of Pete Alonso, they haven’t replaced his power.\n\nLuckily, a star New York’s been linked to in the past could fit the bill. Fansided’s Mark Powell and Wynston Wilcox believe the Mets should make a deal with the Minnesota Twins for their two-time All-Star Byron Buxton. Buxton is a destroyer of baseballs, and anchors the final spot in their outfield with a Platinum Glove.\n\nMORE: Proposed Yankees blockbuster trade sees New York land $100 million two-time All-Star to anchor outfield with Aaron Judge, Cody Bellinger\n\n“What do the Minnesota Twins actually gain from keeping Byron Buxton at this point? That's the biggest reason the Twins would trade him…Much like the Phillies, adding as much firepower into the batting order is necessary. The Mets had a disappointing 2025 season, fell short of the MLB postseason and now have to figure out how to contend in 2026. The Mets added Juan Soto last offseason as their big addition and now they need to replace Pete Alonso's bat. Buxton seems like the perfect option,” Powell and Wilcox wrote.\n\nThis past season, Buxton slashed .264/.327/.551/.878 with 21 doubles, 35 home runs, and 83 RBI in 126 games played. He’s a perfect replacement for Alonso’s power, and his defense is a major upgrade.\n\nMORE: Red Sox predicted to part ways with $90 million .282 AVG star outfielder through trade, make more room for Jarren Duran and Co.\n\nBuxton’s also only set to make around $45 million over the final three years of his contract, and for the big-spending Mets, that could be very attractive.\n\nHopefully, the Mets start negotiations as soon as they can; otherwise, another contender could swoop in and trade for him right under their noses.\n\nProposed blockbuster Pirates trade sees Pittsburgh finish off explosive offseason by landing $330 million two-time MVP, eight-time All-Star to replace Spencer Horwitz\n\nReds predicted to be dark horse blockbuster trade candidate for $330 million two-time MVP, eight-time All-Star after whiffing on Kyle Schwarber\n\nProposed blockbuster Phillies trade sees Philadelphia land $100 million two-time All-Star, Platinum Glove to replace Nick Castellanos",

    "title": "I spent 60 hours traveling on Amtrak trains from New York to Texas. Here are 10 things that surprised me most.",
    "description": "I took two Amtrak trains to get from New York to Austin. Here are unexpected things about traveling across the country in coach for over two days.",
    "fullText": "Local train rides can be slow and clunky, so I prefer long-distance ones — you can largely sit back, relax, and enjoy the journey because the stops are much farther apart.\n\nThe ride was smooth and enjoyable, and I watched the country pass by right outside my window, as if I were watching TV or a movie.\n\nSometimes I was so distracted by a conversation with someone else on board that I forgot we were moving.\n\nLong-distance trains are great when they run properly, but delays can be tough to avoid.\n\nAmtrak mostly operates on freight railroad lines, which means you're often at the mercy of those dispatchers.\n\nTo make matters worse, some lines run on a single track. So if there's an oncoming train, you have to wait on a track siding until it clears.\n\nFreight trains can cause anywhere from 10 minutes to multiple hours of interference.\n\nThese delays — which came every hour or so on my trip — interrupted the joy and relaxation that came with the otherwise smooth ride.\n\nSometimes passengers didn't receive announcements about delays, or only got vague ones. I wish I'd brought a radio scanner that picked up on the frequencies used by the dispatchers so I could stay up to date on the information or estimate the delay time myself.\n\nI brought enough of my own food for my two and a half days on the rails, and my short layover in Chicago gave me a chance to grab a hot meal.\n\nI also packed a reusable bottle so I could fill it up with tap water on the train. However, I was surprised by how many people depended on Amtrak's onboard dining options.\n\nThe café car is OK in a pinch: It has basic snacks, beverages, and hot foods like burgers and pizza.\n\nThe prices aren't unreasonable, but I still don't think they're worth it for food that generally gets taken out of a plastic wrapper and microwaved.\n\nEvery so often, the train made an extended stop at a station for a crew change or servicing, and passengers were allowed to step off for a bit.\n\nThere's no smoking on the trains, so I noticed a fair number of people using these stops as smoke breaks.\n\nHowever, I expected more people to take the opportunity to get some fresh air and stretch, rather than stay on the train.\n\nThere were only so many of these opportunities, and it was great to walk around, feel some sun on my face, and say that I set foot in a different place, instead of just passing through it.\n\nMy trip took me through more than a dozen states, including six state capitals and the US capital.\n\nThe trip from New York to Washington, DC, started out on tracks that were part of the historical Pennsylvania Railroad and continued down one of the busiest rail corridors in the country.\n\nThe bulk of my Cardinal-line trip went along old Chesapeake and Ohio Railway tracks. There was a lot of interesting history to learn about the railroad towns that sprang up along the tracks when they were first laid.\n\nMy trip through Virginia took me across tracks that played a vital role in the Civil War. The train also traveled through old boom-and-bust towns in West Virginia — some of which still exist, but others have only scant remnants.\n\nThe Texas Eagle is one of the few Amtrak trains that doesn't have WiFi, and some areas we passed through had little-to-no cell reception.\n\nThe Cardinal line also passed through areas with poor cell reception, which made the onboard WiFi quite unstable.\n\nFor this reason, I'm glad I brought an AM/FM HD radio with me. I had a lot of fun tuning in to different stations as my trains traveled the country.\n\nIt helped me feel more connected to the small towns and gave them more life. I found surprisingly good content in some remote areas.\n\nI came prepared for my train ride by downloading a bunch of TV shows and movies onto my laptop. However, surprisingly, the 60 hours went by so quickly that I didn't watch any of them.\n\nI only kept my laptop open on the Cardinal line to look at Amtrak's \"Track Your Train\" map.\n\nI was also having too much fun with the radio and didn't want to miss out on live broadcasts. Plus, I could continue fully taking in the sights out the window while listening.\n\nThe train was a very social place at times, too, so I was often busy speaking with the people around me.\n\nThe camaraderie I've experienced on Amtrak train rides is pretty much unmatched.\n\nI didn't get to talk with as many people as I have on past trips, but it was still enjoyable to journey together with a bunch of people for such an extended time.\n\nIt was great to see others get off at their destinations, but, in a funny way, it also made me a little sad to see them (and the ways they contributed to the train's atmosphere) go.\n\nGetting to spend time with fellow passengers from all over the world while different parts of the country passed by provided some true slices of American life.\n\nIt's great to switch things up by sitting and socializing in the café cars.\n\nHowever, the Cardinal and Texas Eagle trains have combined café and dining cars, so seating was very limited and only for passengers who purchased something.\n\nI missed hanging out in observation cars, as I've done on past trips.\n\nI knew this would be the case for my time on the Cardinal, but the Texas Eagle usually has an awesome sightseeing lounge with a variety of seating and viewing windows.\n\nThe fact that my train didn't have one was by far the biggest disappointment of the trip. However, the Eagle has since brought back its observation cars.\n\nIt's definitely worth checking whether your train has an observation car before booking a long Amtrak ride.\n\nWhen you spend enough time somewhere, it can start to feel very familiar and comfortable, which was my case on the train.\n\nDoing things like making room while walking in the aisle so someone else can pass, heading down the stairs to the bathroom, and refilling water bottles felt as routine as anything I'd do at home.\n\nThere was almost a weird comfort in walking around and seeing different parts of the train that became very familiar to me during my many hours aboard.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 9, 2021, and most recently updated on February 17, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Three-year NFL veteran and safety for the Cleveland Browns, Ronnie Hickman, was assaulted by a group of four individuals following a confrontation in the lobby of a Sixty Les hotel located on Allen Street in Manhattan, New York. The incident occurred at approximately 4:30 am after a group of individuals, who remain unidentified, approached Hickman shortly after he entered the building.\n\nAccording to the local authorities who originally spoke with the New York Post, police are actively investigating the matter, as well as whether or not Hickman’s status as a professional athlete had any influence in their decision to approach him. “The suspects slugged Hickman and took off,” the official report states.\n\nThe franchise itself confirmed that Hickman “was a victim of assault early Monday morning at a New York City hotel,” and a personal representative of the Ohio State product also informed the post that “Ronnie was treated for minor injuries at an area hospital after the incident, was later released, and is home resting with his family.”\n\nThe incident, unfortunately, comes right after Hickman had managed to enjoy a career-defining breakout. After recording just 70 total tackles with the Browns throughout all of 2023 and 2024, he managed to finally become a full-time starter in 2025.\n\nThe 2023 undrafted free agent tallied 103 combined tackles throughout his 17 starts this past season, snagging two interceptions and deflecting seven passes along the way. At this time, police have admitted that no arrests have been made and that all four of the primary suspects remain at large.\n\nStaff members who were on site at the time of the assault have also refused to offer up any sort of comments on the issue, but given the upscale nature of the establishment, it’s widely speculated that Hickman may have been profiled. The 24-year-old prospect is set to become a restricted free agent later this offseason, and will likely be resigning with the Browns for a “projected contract between $7 million to $8 million.”\n\nABC7 has suggested that Hickman was, in fact, identified by the four individuals, and that things only escalated after Hickman refused to acknowledge them, but that has yet to be confirmed by either official sources or any of the members in Hickman’s camp.\n\nThe post Cleveland Browns News: Ronnie Hickman Attacked by Goons in Sixty Les Hotel’s Lobby, No Arrests Yet appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "New York Mets owner Steve Cohen may have lost out on the Kyle Tucker sweepstakes, but he isn't backing down from spending big on high-level free agents.",
    "fullText": "New York Mets owner Steve Cohen may have lost out on the Kyle Tucker sweepstakes, but he isn’t backing down from spending big on high-level free agents.\n\nAnthony DiComo, Mets beat writer for MLB.com, quoted Cohen admitting the Los Angeles Dodgers have built a high-level franchise, but he indicated he’s not intimidated.\n\n“They’re formidable,” DiComo shared on social media. “They have the ability to spend. So do I, by the way.”\n\nThe Dodgers have taken some criticism in recent years over their spending to acquire big-name free agents like Shohei Ohtani and Tucker.\n\nThe $240 million contract for Tucker in particular has renewed interest in a possible salary cap in Major League Baseball, which is the only major North American sports league without one.\n\nCohen has admitted he wanted to sign Tucker this offseason and was “annoyed” the team failed to land the prized outfielder.\n\nThe Mets also lost closer Edwin Díaz to the Dodgers, though they were able to sign infielder Bo Bichette, whom the Dodgers had targeted.\n\nIn an interview with Mets broadcaster Howie Rose, Cohen has made the case that the team ultimately is better off with Bichette over Tucker.\n\n“Frankly, once it was all done, and we got Bo to come to the Mets, (I) actually feel Bo might be a better fit for the team,” said Cohen, as reported by Tim Britton for The Athletic. “So I think things worked out for the best.”\n\nWhile fans and owners of other teams might feel like the Dodgers are bad for baseball, current players — even those who face off against the Boys in Blue regularly — love what the team is doing.\n\n“I f—ing love it,” San Diego Padre and former Dodger Manny Machado said of the Dodgers’ spending. “Every team should be doing it. …S— is f—ing great for the game. So I think every team has the ability to do it, so I hope all 30 teams can learn from that.”\n\nBryce Harper of the Philadelphia Phillies echoed that sentiment.\n\n“I love what the Dodgers do, obviously,” Harper said. “They pay the money, they spend the money. I mean, they’re a great team. They understand how to run it. They run their team like a business, and they run it the right way. They understand where they need to put their money into.”",

    "description": "I moved to New York City to pursue a career in fashion journalism. After a few years at my \"dream job,\" I felt burned out and had to redefine success.",
    "fullText": "Ever since I heard Taylor Swift's \"Welcome to New York\" for the first time, the city called my name.\n\nOf course, I was grateful for my suburban upbringing in California, but my town was too small for my aspirations. I wanted to live the life of a fashion journalist, and to me, that required being in New York City.\n\nFixated on my goal, I mapped out a plan in college to secure as many internships and part-time writing gigs as possible, then fling the industry door wide open.\n\nI went on to land a job at a Los Angeles public relations agency before breaking into editorial with a remote position at a lifestyle publication. Then, a few months later, I got a job at one of NYC's most prominent newspapers. It wasn't strictly focused on fashion, but it was my entry point.\n\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic meant I had to spend the first six months working from California, I was excited to move to New York as soon as possible.\n\nWithout knowing a single soul, I set off to the concrete jungle, armed with sheer ambition, nerves, and the belief that if I worked hard enough, I'd have that movie montage moment (cue \"Empire State of Mind\").\n\nI moved into an apartment on my own, and just like that, I was enveloped by the glittering scene that came with the gig, staring at my laptop until my eyes stung with tears and rubbing elbows with Hollywood's elite. It was a thrill, to say the least, but I still had my eyes on fashion.\n\nOne year later, I pulled it off, landing a role at the glossy I'd been collecting for nearly a decade.\n\nWithin days, my life changed: I was sitting front row at New York Fashion Week and juggling an output that seemed to multiply tenfold — making my heart race so fast my Oura ring began to flag stress spikes.\n\nThis new life shimmered from miles away, with friends and family saying, \"Your life is like a movie.\" By the world's standards, I had \"made it,\" but underneath the dazzling designer façade was a quiet truth no one had prepared me for.\n\nAttaining everything I'd dreamed of by 26 meant drowning in a sea of deadlines, navigating corporate politics, and feeling pressured to sustain my success — smack dab in the middle of a quarter-life crisis.\n\nThe increasing number of industry-wide layoffs also nixed the possibility of a promotion despite my best efforts. Still, the work accelerated and my responsibilities expanded. I was left feeling overlooked and depleted — and my mental health suffered.\n\nI began to question who I was apart from my career, if I wasn't climbing (and rising) to the top. What's worse is that this feeling began to seep into other areas of my life, feeding the lie that I didn't measure up.\n\nThat's when I realized \"making it\" couldn't be as simple as owning luxury handbags, interviewing stars, and typing up thousands of stories.\n\nInstead of feeling fulfilled, I was left with a strange ache that the life I'd worked so hard to achieve wasn't enough. So, I started re-evaluating how I wanted to live, my values, and where I saw myself in five years.\n\nI decided my next move would have to allow me to do what I love and still prioritize the other elements of my life that make me me: family, friendships, hobbies, and faith.\n\nStill, entertaining the concept of \"what comes next\" was unsettling, especially considering I'd up and moved my entire life just a few years prior, and I genuinely adored writing and style.\n\nI wondered whether pursuing something new would be a failure or if people would think I was weak. This inner debate gnawed at me for months, while work opportunities that once thrilled me felt like extra weight.\n\nBut finally, it clicked. Making a career change wouldn't be quitting or failing — I'd already clawed my way to the big leagues and thrived — and my purpose came from much more than my work.\n\nSo, nearly a year later, I left my dream job to freelance within the fashion space, deciding to stay within the industry and city I love — but on my own terms. Still, I'll always be grateful for the early years of my career; I couldn't have pursued my new path without them.\n\nAnd I know this won't be the final shift I make in my life, because it's the bends in the road that make it meaningful.\n\nAs it turns out, \"making it\" is a milestone that can be continually redefined, and landing my \"dream job\" was only the beginning of the story.",

    "description": "NYC's City of Yes policy, led by Dan Garodnick, aims to address housing crisis. Mayor Mamdani faces challenges in implementing affordable solutions.",
    "fullText": "In his four years as director of the New York City Department of Planning, Dan Garodnick oversaw one of the most sweeping changes to the city's zoning rules in decades. The policy, called City of Yes, initiated a collection of revisions to boost housing, including updates that allow new apartment projects to add bulk used for affordable housing, homes to convert basements or add backyard cottages as accessory dwellings, and more office buildings to be converted into residential space.\n\nMayor Zohran Mamdani won the election last year on bold campaign pledges to deliver solutions for a worsening housing and affordability crisis. Mamdani's promises to freeze rents, however, could further dissuade owners of aging rent regulated apartment buildings — who were already dealt a financial blow by a 2019 change to the rent regulation rules — from performing needed maintenance.\n\nMamdani's mayoralty will be a test whether politicians across the country can lower housing costs without destabilizing the landlords that build and maintain most of the housing stock.\n\nGarodnick, who will soon leave his post, spoke with Business Insider to look back on his accomplishments and offer advice to the new mayor. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe real estate community has not been excited about Mamdani. What would you tell them?\n\nI would encourage them to give him a chance to lay out his agenda for housing and economic development and make their determinations.\n\nWhat advice did you give him? Did you give him any?\n\nFocus on delivering results and making sure that the government can execute ideas at scale. And also that the city council is meant to be an active counterbalance to the mayor, and that is something he should embrace and to give elected officials the tools they need to be able to say yes to hard things.\n\nDo you think Mamdani will freeze regulated rents? Do you think that's the right move?\n\nYes. I think that's a top priority for the mayor, and I think people should expect to see that.\n\nI think it's an important signal to renters that the mayor is looking out for them and their interests. I also think it's important to strike a balance here and make sure that it does not have unintended consequences and push buildings into distress.\n\nLandlords of regulated buildings are saying their properties are falling apart, and they have no incentive to fix them. Do they need money from rent increases?\n\nIt's important that the city and state make sure that its policies not only protect tenants from unreasonable rent increases and abuse from landlords, but also that the living conditions and the health and safety of these buildings is satisfactory too. We need to make sure that we're striking the right balance here.\n\nAfter four years at the agency, how does it feel to leave?\n\nWe enabled through zoning changes in four years, more homes than had been enabled in the prior 20 years combined.\n\nYou have rules that were written 60 years ago that had the effect of limiting too narrowly where and how much housing you can build. It is no surprise then that you would see many neighborhoods of the city producing little or no house. City of Yes was designed to enable a little more housing in every neighborhood of the city.\n\nThe real estate community says that may be impressive, but it's still not enough to get housing built at scale.\n\nThere is no question that while zoning sticks around for long periods of time, there are other factors like the interest rate environments, the existence of a tax incentive, or even any single property owner's appetite for risk or access to capital.\n\nThere is often substantial pushback against ambitious rezonings. What does that say about the public's reception to housing development at scale?\n\nChange is hard, and people are rightfully skeptical. We focused relentlessly on clarity, plain language explanations, visual tools, multilingual outreach, and engagement with communities across the city. We met people where they were, and we explained how outdated rules affect everyday life and made the case that the housing crisis isn't inevitable.\n\nWhat is the political feasibility in your mind of dramatic solutions to the housing crisis, specifically large-scale development?\n\nWe wanted to strike a balance here that was historic in its scale, but also something that we believed we could build support for. That is always going to be a balance. I will note that the voters of New York City recently approved charter revisions, which will make it easier in some cases to allow for housing to be approved more quickly and shows that there's an appetite for the city, the mayor, the city council, to continue to take some big swings at this problem.\n\nWhat do you think those big swings will be?\n\nMayor Mamdani has been clear about his interest in creating more housing in New York City and has cited City of Yes as an important template to build on. As he's shaping his agenda, I would expect you might see some exciting new initiatives that continue to move the ball forward.",

In early February, the Celtics assigned him to participate in portions of a practice with their G League affiliate, the Maine Celtics, at the Auerbach Center. This included his first 5-on-5 scrimmage since the injury, involving rostered players, two-way players, and G Leaguers. Tatum described the session as the next logical step in his plan, noting he felt good afterward and emphasizing a focus on daily improvement without committing to an immediate return. He stressed following the structured progression to ensure full readiness.\n\nTeammate Jaylen Brown offered positive feedback recently, stating that Tatum “looks pretty damn good” based on what he’s observed during this phase. Reports indicate Tatum has ramped up activity aggressively, with no setbacks mentioned, and he continues individual on-court work alongside team integration efforts. Celtics president Brad Stevens has maintained a cautious approach, prioritizing Tatum being fully cleared medically and mentally at 110% before any game action.\n\nWhile a return this season remains possible, Tatum has expressed that he wants to come back at full strength, not as a diminished version of himself. Discussions continue, with no firm timeline set.\n\nCeltics’ Jaylen Brown Reveals UFC Aspirations",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants bolstered their offensive staff with the hiring of Matt Nagy as offensive coordinator, positioning him to guide second-year quarterback Jaxson Dart under head coach John Harbaugh.\n\nNagy, who previously coordinated for the Kansas City Chiefs alongside Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce—contributing to multiple Super Bowl runs—brings extensive experience after stints as the Chicago Bears head coach and earlier roles.\n\nDart, coming off an encouraging rookie campaign where he amassed 24 total touchdowns and just seven turnovers across starts, proactively sought insights on his new coordinator.\n\nESPN's Jordan Raanan reports that Dart engaged in multiple conversations with Mahomes about working with Nagy, emerging impressed by the feedback. During Super Bowl week, he also consulted Kelce, who offered glowing endorsements of his former play-caller.\n\nDart, fresh off a rookie season with 24 total touchdowns and seven turnovers, talked on multiple occasions with Mahomes about working with Nagy, according to multiple sources close to the QB. He came away impressed. He also told reporters last week that he spoke with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce about his former coordinator and received rave reviews.\n\nIn an exclusive Forbes interview, Dart elaborated on his enthusiasm.\n\n\"I can’t wait to get the chance to play for him. Just so many great things that are said about him and his coaching style and the work that he puts in, the passion that he has for the game,\" he said.\n\nDart praised Nagy as a \"quarterback guy\" who prioritizes putting players \"in the best situation and position to succeed,\" and tailors approaches to individual QBs. Dart noted Kelce \"didn’t have anything but tremendous things to say about Coach Nags,\" reinforcing positive views from Chiefs stars.\n\nNagy's scheme aligns well with Dart's strengths, with minimal expected adjustments from prior systems.\n\nThis \"loaded\" staff, including other ex-caches and coordinators, signals the Giants' commitment to Dart's growth as they aim to elevate their offense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Jaxson Dart spoke with Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce about Matt Nagy",

    "description": "A man who moved from  New York to Miami was prepared to feel lonely. He reached out to an old acquaintance for lunch and found a close friend to share retirement with.",
    "fullText": "Relocating to a new city is a mixed bag — especially when you're nearing retirement.\n\nWhen I moved away from home for grad school in 1990 at age 28, it was easy to socialize, since I was surrounded by classmates eager to make friends.\n\nBut in 2021, when I moved from New York to Miami for work at age 58, it was much harder to meet new people. The COVID-19 pandemic was still lingering, and I tried to connect with colleagues over a socially distanced lunch, but I couldn't really join clubs or meet neighbours. I found it hard to expand my relationships beyond work.\n\nI wondered how I'd make any friends, but later that year, I reached out to an old acquaintance and learned that it's possible to make good friends at any age.\n\nAfter arriving in Miami, I read articles about how to make friends as an adult. Some suggested rekindling old acquaintances. The logic seemed wiser than starting from scratch. I could reach out to people I already knew, or used to know even a little bit.\n\nI looked through my Facebook friends and LinkedIn connections for people who lived in Miami. I paused on Bruno's name because he brought back good memories. We had worked together seven years prior, when our respective companies collaborated on a project. I valued his ability to drive impressive results and radiate infectious positivity. He'd mentioned at the time that he appreciated how I kept the project on track.\n\nI hesitated to reach out. Our interactions had been friendly, but we'd only connected through work. Would it seem odd to Bruno to get an email from me after all these years? And was I leaping too far by suggesting a personal lunch?\n\nI swallowed my fears by crafting a friendly note, rereading it three times, and hitting send. The next day, Bruno responded warmly: \"Welcome to Miami. I look forward to having lunch.\"\n\nWhen the lunch came around a few weeks later, it went better than I expected. In addition to chuckling over old war stories about work, we discovered that we were both news junkies, avid travelers, and cyclists. At the end, Bruno said, \"That was really fun. You and your girlfriend should come over to our place for an Argentine barbecue.\"\n\nBruno and I started lunching roughly every other week. I was approaching 60 and itching to leave my job, and Bruno was already semi-retired. As someone on the cusp of a new life chapter, I valued having a friend at the same juncture.\n\nWe'd frequently talk about all things retirement, like the best investment strategies for our retirement portfolios, including how much risk to take and how many international stocks to hold. Discussions with a wise friend were much more satisfying than reading through reams of investment advice. We could debate, candidly admit our concerns, and test our logic. I became wiser and more confident.\n\nAs we grew closer, we discussed our hopes and anxieties about stepping off the corporate treadmill. I explained my desire, after decades of work, to release myself from the self-imposed pressure of always being productive. Bruno shared that he'd dealt with similar feelings, which made me feel validated. Our conversations gave me the confidence I needed to take the plunge and enter retirement in 2022, without feeling as guilty as I might have done about working less and enjoying myself more.\n\nSince I've retired, Bruno has been a valued companion. With no work schedules, we almost felt like we were playing hooky when we attended a weekday lecture by the Finnish ambassador to the US and took a day trip to see a touring Rembrandt exhibit. These post-retirement experiences are richer because I can share them with a friend who also enjoys exploring, joking, and giving his insights.\n\nI once mistakenly assumed that you can't form close friendships later in life, without the social intensity and openness of youth. When I first moved to Miami, I thought I'd make some acquaintances or group friendships, rather than forming any deep bonds. I was prepared to feel somewhat lonely.\n\nLast summer, Bruno and I escaped Miami's heat by flying to Upstate New York for a cycling trip. He fell on some railroad tracks, breaking his collarbone and ribs. In the emergency room, I whispered, \"Let's tell them I'm your brother, so I can stay past visiting hours.\" I sat by his side until his procedures were done at 4 a.m., keeping him entertained with the type of stories and gallows humor that only good friends share. We tried not to laugh too hard, so his ribs wouldn't jab him.\n\nBruno has since recovered and even bravely gotten back on his bike to meet me for meals again. During a recent get-together, he told me, \"Some people are really surprised that I found such a good friend later in life.\"\n\nI replied with a smile, \"What do you mean, friend? I thought we were brothers.\"",

    "description": "The former New York Giants head coach faced a backlash after discussing the intersection of child-rearing and football.",
    "fullText": "Ole Miss quarterbacks coach Joe Judge released a statement Saturday after a quote from a court appearance went viral, insisting that his comments about fathers of newborns prioritizing their sleep were \"taken out of context.\"\n\nThe comments were given Thursday during the hearing for Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss' request for an injunction to play a sixth season of college football. That injunction was granted Friday.\n\nOne clip of Judge's testimony took off in particular, in which Judge recounts telling the partners of players with young children that they need to prevent those children from waking them up in the middle of the night.\n\nNEW: Ole Miss coach Joe Judge tells pregnant partners of players during the season that the father has to play good football.\n\n“He needs to be in another room, detached… he ain’t waking up for midnight feedings.” pic.twitter.com/LQG7t0fQtX\n\n— College Transfer Portal (@CollegeFBPortal) February 12, 2026\n\nNotably, that clip identifies Judge as an Ole Miss coach and refers to unspecified players, but what it does not mention is the conversation at the time was about Judge's experience dealing with sleep disorders while in NFL player development with the New England Patriots.\n\nIn his statement, Judge clarified that the conversations about playing football while raising a child were only in the NFL, never the collegiate level:\n\n\"Some of my comments from Thursday have been taken out of context, so l'd like to provide some clarity. In a discussion about Trinidad's sleep apnea, I was trying to point out the importance that the NFL places on sleep for recovery and performance in addition to the education of balancing family dynamics during the football season.\n\n\"These are discussions I was a part of at the professional level from veteran players based on their own experience managing similar situations. These are not discussions we've had at the collegiate level. As a husband and father of four children, I understand those challenges first hand and would never diminish the commitment to family. We share that same dedication to family with our players and always support them through any challenges they face in their personal.\"\n\nJudge worked under Bill Belichick from 2012 to 2019, became head coach of the New York Giants in 2020, then moved back to the Patriots after his firing in 2022. He joined Ole Miss in 2024 and currently holds the titles of quarterbacks coach and \"head coach of offense\" (John David Baker is the offensive coordinator under head coach Pete Golding).\n\nIn the interest of clarity and not taking Judge out of context, here is the larger exchange about dealing with NFL players with sleep disorders:\n\nQ: \"Can a sleep disorder affect a player's ability?\"\n\nQ: \"Has that occurred in your past where you have encountered players with sleep disorders?\"\n\nQ: \"And what did you do for those players?\"\n\nA: \"Well, we got them the CPAP machines. We tracked their sleep. We made sure they were evening out their sleep cycles, that they're properly rested. That was several players over the course of years.\n\n\"And then there was also the players that we would have to educate — this is always a tough conversation to have. It's not a popular opinion, this is the truth, we would have to educate significant others who may have been pregnant during the season, or were going to have a baby during the season, and you'd have to educate them on — you have this baby in the middle of the season, that father has to play good football. It's a day-by-day production business. He has to be ready to perform and go out there and play, and when I say that is, you need to let him sleep. He needs to be in another room, detached.\n\n\"You have to explain to the mother, 'Listen, he ain't waking up for the midnight feedings. After the season, he's full metal jacket. You can do whatever you want with him, he'll change every diaper. In season, he's got to have a different priority.\n\n\"Now, there were examples to use from that. We had some older veteran players — I can or can't share names if you want me too — who had multiple children who would sleep in other rooms. Their wives would bring in family or a nursing aid to help throughout the night, and those players continue to play high-level football. We had other players who are young who quite simply did what every other father in the world does, waking up, changing diapers, doing feedings, and led to injuries, led to soft-tissue injuries, not being rested, not being recovered, not being ready to roll.\"\n\nQ: \"That never occurred to me, that newborns can affect injuries on the football field. But who had to deliver that message?\"\n\nQ: \"And to whom did you deliver the message?\"\n\nA: \"About as good as you'd expect (laughs).\"",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants are signing wide receiver Courtney Jackson to a reserve/futures contract.\n\nThe move comes shortly after the conclusion of the 2025 season, in which Jackson was a member of the practice squad for the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks. The 5-foot-11, 179-pound receiver provides depth at the position and potential special teams value, particularly as a return specialist.\n\nJackson, 24, began his college career at Syracuse University (2019–2022), where he appeared in 36 games and recorded 63 receptions for 662 yards, while also handling punt returns, including a touchdown. He transferred to Arkansas State University (2023–2024), playing in 26 games and totaling 81 catches for 1,183 yards and 9 touchdowns.\n\nAcross his collegiate career, he amassed 144 receptions for an average of 12.8 yards per catch and 13 receiving scores, plus solid return contributions (14.0 yards per punt return on 40 attempts and 20.3 yards on kickoffs).\n\nUndrafted in the 2025 NFL draft, Jackson initially signed with the Denver Broncos as a free agent but was released before joining Seattle's practice squad in August 2025. He spent the year there, earning a Super Bowl ring despite not appearing in regular-season games.\n\nThe reserve/futures deal secures Jackson's rights for the 2026 season, allowing the Giants to evaluate him during offseason programs. This low-risk addition addresses receiver depth and bolsters the return game amid broader roster changes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants sign WR Courtney Jackson to reserve/future contract",

    "fullText": "The former \"Real Housewives of New York City\" star Bethenny Frankel built her public persona in the Big Apple, but after moving to Florida in 2025, she says the Sunshine State is the new cultural hub for America's rich and famous.\n\n\"Miami is the new LA,\" Frankel, 55, told Business Insider. \"In the way that LA was the cool place to be, and aspirational people wanted to be there.\"\n\nLast March, the reality TV veteran, entrepreneur, and social media influencer joined a wave of New Yorkers relocating to South Florida, settling on the coast with her teenage daughter.\n\nShe's one of many Americans leaving cultural hubs like New York and Los Angeles for smaller cities in the Sun Belt. A January 2026 Bank of America Institute study on US migration found that New York recorded the second-largest population loss of any US city in the fourth quarter of 2025, after Los Angeles. About 45% of outbound New Yorkers headed southward, with Miami alone accounting for 7% of departures.\n\n\"It's also cool to be in New York,\" Frankel said, \"but not as much as being in Miami, and Florida in general.\"\n\nAmong the Florida arrivals is a number of billionaires. Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Glenview Capital Management's CEO, Larry Robbins, have all relocated from northern cities to Florida's warmer shores in the past four years.\n\n\"Rich people are moving down here,\" said Frankel, who runs the private membership dating community The Core. \"Miami's exploded, real-estate-wise.\"\n\nData backs that up. Realtor.com's December 2025 Luxury Housing Report found that the Miami metro area had the highest number of million-dollar listings in the country, snatching a title that had traditionally been held by New York. More than a quarter of demand in the Miami metro region originated from the New York metro area, the report found.\n\nFrankel said the influx of new wealth has changed Miami's cultural landscape. \"It means shopping, art, nightlife, the real-estate cool factor,\" she said. \"Everybody went where the money is. The money is dictating what's happening on social media, and what's happening that's cool.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Lucia Moses reported in December that Miami is emerging as a hub for social media influencers. It had the highest number of top Instagram creators per capita of any US city, ahead of New York and LA.\n\nFlorida's draw in recent years, however, has extended beyond just billionaires and social-media influencers. Business Insider previously reported that differences in tax policy and cost of living meant that someone earning $150,000 a year could save roughly $50,000 annually by moving from New York City to Miami, largely due to Florida's lack of state income tax.\n\nFor Frankel, the move offered more than that. She said it has made her \"more social\" and allowed her to run her businesses from the \"sunniest and most beautiful-weathered place.\"\n\nWhile Florida has drawn in large numbers of domestic migrants since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Miami has begun to hemorrhage residents. The Bank of America Institute study found that Miami recorded the third-largest domestic population decline among US cities in the fourth quarter of 2025, with many residents relocating to more affordable parts of Florida, including Orlando and Tampa.\n\nIn Frankel's views, the whole state is having a moment. \"Delray, Palm Beach, Boca, Miami, the Design District,\" she said. \"Florida is on fire.\"",

    "fullText": "A custom suit is the signature look on Wall Street, and it's New York's tailors who keep the city's bankers, stockbrokers, and lawyers looking sharp.\n\nSome of these businesses have been city fixtures for decades, while others are newer arrivals that have quickly built reputations in the finance world.\n\nHere's a look behind the scenes at three of the tailor shops that serve Wall Street, and who owns them.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Alan Flusser's shop near East 48th Street and Fifth Avenue has been a fixture for Wall Street clients. Flusser designed the wardrobes of the iconic movies \"Wall Street\" and \"American Psycho.\"\n\nWhen Flusser retired in 2020, Sigmon, who had previously worked for Suitsupply, took the reins.\n\nHe described the house style to Business Insider as relaxed and \"guided by proper proportions meant to flatter the individual\" rather than trends.\n\nLS Mens Clothing on West 45th Street and Sixth Avenue is a family business that first opened in 1954.\n\n\"I've been doing this for 42 years,\" Zuber told Business Insider.\n\nIn his decades-long career, he's observed some notable shifts in styles.\n\n\"People are dressing thinner,\" he said. \"They're dressing thinner in the arms — even the conservative people, the business people.\"\n\nBefore opening Michael Andrews Bespoke, Andrews trained as an engineer and later worked as a corporate attorney. Required to wear a suit daily, he said he struggled to find off-the-rack options that met his standards.\n\nHe started having custom suits made, and went on to study tailoring.\n\nHe launched the business in 2006, and the flagship is store on Great Jones Alley in NoHo, between Broadway and Lafayette. The newer store is on West 20th Street, between Sixth and Seventh avenues.\n\nIt also has locations in Washington. D.C., Miami, and soon London.\n\n\"The vast majority of our clients are either investment bankers, finance guys, private equity, your typical New York finance guy, or lawyers who, to a large degree, service the financial industry,\" Andrews told Business Insider.\n\nIn 2024, Michael Andrews Bespoke employed three new full-time and two part-time tailors.\n\nRising demand for alterations led the business to hire a further two staff members in NYC the following year, bringing the total to four full-time and three part-time tailors in 2025.\n\n\"We've had dozens of clients bring back entire wardrobes,\" Andrews told Business Insider. \"For a couple of clients, it's 20 to 40 pieces that we've had to take in because they've lost 20 to 30 pounds.\"\n\nSigmon and Zuber also told Business Insider that demand for alterations, mostly take-ins, is growing as Wall Street clients' waistlines shrink.\n\nAs Andrews put it, \"the Ozempic effect is real.\"\n\nRead more about how GLP-1s are reshaping Wall Street.",

    "description": "The big NYC bitcoin bonanza drew top commentators in the market, who told attendees they see bitcoin set for a rebound later this year.",
    "fullText": "Where in New New York City can you see cowboys in snakeskin boots rubbing elbows with Patagonia hedge-fund vest bros?\n\nThe answer is Bitcoin Investors Week in NYC, the multi-day bitcoin bonanza hosted by tech entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano. This year's event kicked off in the depths of a bitcoin bear market, but the exuberance—irrational or otherwise—was on full display throughout the halls.\n\nAn abundance of bitcoin-orange ties and a jubilant mood were the vibes of the whole event.\n\nChris Klein, COO of crypto retirement platform Bitcoin IRA, insisted that the crypto community isn't worried about the current market downturn.\n\n\"Every eighteen months we go through something like this, so if anybody's been in this space long enough, this is the third or fourth time they've been through this,\" he said. \n\nSam Callahan, director of bitcoin strategy and research at digital asset treasury OranjeBTC, echoed the sentiment, saying that seasoned crypto investors remember bear markets much worse than the current decline.\n\nThe bitcoin bear market has dragged on for about four months now, with prices down as much as 50% from the peak earlier this month. They've recovered slightly but are stuck around $70,000, with no clear catalyst on the horizon. Still, for retail and institutional investors, the deep freeze doesn't appear to be souring the mood.\n\nMike Novogratz, CEO of digital asset investment firm Galaxy Digital, revealed that he's been buying more bitcoin recently in anticipation of shifting macro conditions and policy updates.\n\nCathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management, continued to describe bitcoin as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, adding that she thinks blockchain technology is poised to play a role in the next phase of the tech boom.\n\nAnd Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, one of Wall Street's loudest tech bulls, said that he doesn't think anyone can be bullish on tech without being bullish on bitcoin, predicting there will be more use cases for it in the near future.\n\nThe attendees who spoke with Business Insider on the sidelines of the event were equally bullish, donning bitcoin pins on blazer lapels and sporting orange ties in tribute to bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor.\n\n\"These conferences during market drawdowns are refreshing,\" Klint Drici, head of institutional sales at Arch Lending, a crypto-backed loan platform, said. \"They showcase the real builders and operators.\"\n\nIndeed, there were almost as many bitcoin entrepreneurs as investors at the event, boasting about projects they had in the works even as crypto winter deepened.\n\nEran Barak, founder of blockchain consulting firm Breem Group, said that he thinks the macro landscape is shifting in a direction that favors bitcoin, citing regulatory developments on the horizon.\n\n\"As the CLARITY Act moves closer to approval and Fed rate cuts are increasingly expected, funds and enterprises are viewing Bitcoin as a treasury diversification tool—boosting its perceived value as fresh liquidity flows into the market,\" he stated.\n\nMany of the crypto pros at the event didn't quite agree on when bitcoin might rebound, but all maintained that it should stage a comeback this year. Real estate entrepreneur and investor Grant Cardone, who spoke about his bitcoin investing strategy, told Business Insider that he thinks it could move horizontally in the short term before gaining fresh momentum.\n\n\"I think it could go sideways til the Fall or late Summer,\" he said. \"It could touch $40,000, could touch $38,000 and still hit $180,000 before the end of the year.\"",

    "description": ", Shariq Khan, Marianna Parraga and Arathy Somasekhar NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Valero Energy is set to buy up to 6.5 million barrels of Venezuelan crude in March bound for its Gulf",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Valero Energy is set to buy up to 6.5 million barrels of Venezuelan crude in March bound for its Gulf Coast refineries, making it the top foreign refiner of the OPEC country's oil ‌since the United States captured President Nicolas Maduro in January, sources said on Friday.\n\nWhat role is Valero playing in Venezuelan crude imports?\n\nWhat are Venezuela's current oil production and export levels?\n\nHow do recent U.S. sanctions changes affect Venezuelan oil?\n\nHow much Venezuelan oil revenue is under U.S. control?\n\nValero was among the first U.S. refiners to resume imports of ‌Venezuelan crude after the United States struck a flagship $2 billion oil supply deal with the country's interim government and began to ease sanctions. If Valero succeeds in snapping up 10 or more cargoes ​next month, equivalent to around 210,000 barrels per day, it could surpass U.S. oil major Chevron as the top U.S. refiner of Venezuelan crude.\n\nThat would also be the most Venezuelan crude oil Valero would process since the United States first sanctioned the country's oil industry in January 2019.\n\nChevron, the only U.S. major producing oil in Venezuela, is expected to boost exports of Venezuelan crude to some 300,000 bpd in March, from 220,000 bpd in January, sources told Reuters last month. Chevron typically refines up to half of ‌those exports at its own refineries, and sells the ⁠rest to other U.S. refiners.\n\nA large portion of Chevron's sales of Venezuelan oil to U.S. refiners typically goes to Valero. In March, Chevron is expected to supply Valero with most of the volume the refiner is planning to import, six sources said.\n\nValero ⁠has also negotiated some cargoes from trading houses including Trafigura, which were the first companies authorized by the U.S. government last month to join Chevron in trading Venezuelan oil.\n\nVitol has separately scheduled three naphtha cargoes to be delivered to Venezuela's state company PDVSA between February 22 and March 3, according to a shipping plan seen by Reuters.\n\nThe sources cautioned that ​loading ​schedules have not been finalized and are still subject to revision. They spoke on condition of ​anonymity to discuss confidential information.\n\nVitol and Trafigura declined to comment. ‌Chevron and PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA Valero spokesperson referred to comments made by executive Randy Hawkins after its fourth-quarter earnings release on January 29. In those comments, Hawkins confirmed Valero was in talks with authorized sellers of Venezuelan crude and expected it to make up a \"pretty large part\" of its heavy-crude purchases in February and March.\n\nValero, which has the second-largest U.S. refining network capable of processing Venezuelan heavy oil, had a long-term supply agreement to buy crude from PDVSA before U.S. sanctions.",

    "description": "A former high-ranking official in the New York Police Department has been charged with accepting $35,000 in cash, luxury travel perks and other bribes from a Florida businessman seeking to sell panic ...",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A former high-ranking official in the New York Police Department has been charged with accepting $35,000 in cash, luxury travel perks and other bribes from a Florida businessman seeking to sell panic buttons to the city’s public schools and police.\n\nIn an indictment Thursday, federal prosecutors said Kevin Taylor attempted to steer an $11 million contract toward the company, SaferWatch, while serving as the commanding officer of the NYPD’s School Safety Division. The company markets its product as a “mobile panic alert system” used for mass shootings and other emergencies.\n\nIn exchange, the company’s founder, Gene Roefaro, showered Taylor and his romantic partner with gifts — including luxury hotels and airfare to the Bahamas and Las Vegas, helicopter tours, tickets to Broadway musicals and a “medieval-themed dinner theater” — along with multiple cash payments, prosecutors said.\n\nTaylor pleaded not guilty to bribery and wire fraud charges on Thursday. An emailed inquiry to his attorney was not returned.\n\nRoefaro is also facing charges, including bribery and wire fraud. He has not yet entered a plea. An attorney for Roefaro said it was “puzzling and deeply concerning that the United States Attorney’s Office has chosen to pursue charges against Geno, while at the very same time, alleging — and seeking to prove — that he was the victim of an extortionate shakedown.\"\n\nThe charges are the latest allegations of corruption and favor-trading lodged against officials appointed by the city’s former mayor, Eric Adams, who faced his own indictment in a separate bribery scheme that also involved luxury travel gifts.\n\nWhile the case against Adams was later abandoned by the Trump administration, at least some of the probes into his inner circle remain active, including an ongoing bribery case involving his former chief advisor. In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have announced bribery charges against two other NYPD officers and a former housing official under Adams.\n\nThe investigation into SaferWatch first emerged in September 2024 as part of a sprawling federal probe into the Adams administration. The company was one of several to hire a consulting firm run by the brother of two top Adams officials, both of whom resigned after their homes were searched by federal authorities.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege that in 2023 Taylor helped secured a no-bid contract to pilot Roefaro’s products within the command center of the NYPD’s school safety division. But as the police official struggled to expand the program, Roefaro grew frustrated, at times describing himself as a “sugar daddy” who had “made a MAJOR investment and zero return,” according to the indictment.\n\n“It’s been fun, but it’s not fun or funny anymore,” Roefaro allegedly texted Taylor in late 2023. “Our company (ME) needs to report something real and significant that is in place prior to end of year.”\n\nDays later, Taylor tried to put together a press conference to announce his division would be procuring a tip line from Roefaro's company, prosecutors said. But that event was later cancelled.\n\nDuring roughly the same time, Taylor was also attempting to solicit $75,000 in bribes from two businessmen involved in a company that sold bullet-resistant vests to police, according to the indictment. Both men declined his solicitations, prosecutors said.",

    "description": "Trump abandoned his longtime home state of New York in 2019 amid multiple civil and criminal probes into his conduct",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Friday suggested that he could make his post-presidency home near a North Carolina military base instead of the gilded Florida social club where he’s lived since leaving his longtime New York home to avoid various investigations into his conduct.\n\nTrump was winding his way through remarks to soldiers at Fort Bragg that were little different from his usual political stump speech when he began boasting about the “billions” his administration is purportedly investing into improvements to housing and other facilities on the sprawling military base.\n\nHe also claimed his administration would similarly spend “billions of dollars” on improvements “here and around the area” to “make it great” because “people in this area have been so incredible.”\n\n“In fact, I'm thinking about moving here someday. Maybe I'll, maybe I'll move here with our great movie star ... with our First Lady,” he said, referring to first lady Melania Trump, who had also traveled to the base in a rare joint appearance with her husband.\n\nTurning to his wife, he said: “We'll move to Fort. Bragg. Would you like that, darling?”\n\nThe first lady, who seemed to be there as much to promote her documentary as to ride along on to Mar-a-Lago afterward, laughed and seemed to nod, at which point Trump resumed speaking, telling the assembled soldiers: “She loves you.”\n\n“It’s a possibility — actually, it's not a bad idea, because we love it,” he said.\n\nWhile the president’s remarks were made in jest, he does have some family ties to the Tar Heel State through his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native who has twice considered but rejected chances to run for open Senate seats there.\n\nTrump and his wife previously changed their primary residence in 2019, when they filed documents to officially shift their domicile from the eponymous New York skyscraper where he’d lived since 1983 to Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach, Florida mansion where he maintains quarters while using the gilded age-era residence as a social club for dues-paying members.\n\nAt the time, he claimed to “cherish” the Empire State, where he lived from birth through the start of his first term in the White House in 2018 but complained that he’d been “treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state” amid multiple civil and criminal investigations into his conduct there.\n\nThe first lady’s appearance alongside her husband — only one of a select few speaking engagements she’s had with him since his return to the White House — comes weeks after the premier of a hagiographic documentary about her preparations for his January 2025 inauguration that was purchased by Amazon for $40 million in what critics derided as a blatant payoff to her and her husband.\n\nAmazon also reportedly spent $35 million to market the film, which thus far has brought in just over $13 million in box office revenues since it was released in theaters last month.\n\nTrump referenced the documentary’s box office performance in his remarks to the troops, telling them that the United States “is truly blessed to have such a phenomenal First Lady.”\n\n“And now she’s a movie star,” he said.",

    "fullText": "She attended the designer's fall runway show wearing a high-neck halter gown made from gauze-like fabric.\n\nIt wrapped around her body, creating a subtle see-through effect, and its skirt extended into a short train.\n\nShe wore it with a fuzzy jacket that she carried around her waist.\n\nShe made an appearance at the Tory Burch fall/winter runway show wearing a preppy look from the brand. It comprised a white pleated skirt with a black, button-up blouse tucked in.\n\nUnfortunately, the two pieces sat loosely on Anderson and appeared too formal.\n\nHer leather belt, sheer tights, pointed heels, and black purse added some fun to the look, but the base layers were ultimately too simple for them to work.\n\nWhile entering the Ralph Lauren show, Reinhart was photographed wearing a brown tweed blazer as a top with a thick brown belt holding it closed at the waist.\n\nShe also wore a long black skirt covered in leather fringe, which added texture and contrast to the ensemble.\n\nHigh black boots and a small brown purse completed the fun, fashion-forward look.\n\nAlso at the Tory Burch show, Seyfried wore a golden, long-sleeved blouse atop a blue midi skirt with silver stripes. She also wore white heels with silver adornments and carried a blue purse.\n\nThe mix of two metallic shades with blue tones created a unique, fun color combination that complemented her hair and skin tone.\n\nOutside the Tory Burch runway show, the Olympic gymnast was photographed wearing an oversize blue jacket with a form-fitting wrap skirt in a vibrant red shade.\n\nThe two pieces were drastically different in style, and they overwhelmed her petite frame. They also didn't match the lime-green top she wore or her black accessories.\n\nThe \"Stranger Things\" actor attended the show in blue jeans, a button-up top, and a leather jacket that matched his sneakers and Coach purse.\n\nThe latter piece was especially fun. It featured a prominent pocket reminiscent of a coin purse and two keychains that looked like miniature books.\n\nMcLaughlin has been one of the best-dressed men at New York Fashion Week so far.\n\nThe model sat in the stands wearing skinny black pants with a billowing blouse. The semi-sheer white garment had a high neckline, balloon sleeves, and extra fabric at the waist that extended into a train.\n\nThe top piece was dramatic and memorable, while her pants were perfectly tailored to highlight her dramatically pointed heels.\n\nFor the Michael Kors runway show, the actor wore an all-white ensemble that included trousers, a loose-fitting blouse, sneakers, and a trench coat.\n\nThe outfit would have worked for him if it featured more than one color. Because the entire ensemble was stark white, each piece blended into the others, creating the illusion that he was wearing a baggy jumpsuit.",

The company is based in New Albany and traces its roots to a 12-stool diner opened in 1948 by founder Bob Evans in Gallipolis, Ohio.\n\nDublin keeps Irish Festival ticket prices unchanged for 2026\n\n“We are proud of what we accomplished in partnership with Golden Gate Capital and excited to begin this next chapter with 4×4’s hands-on partnership,” said Mickey Mills, the restaurant chain’s CEO, who will continue to lead the brand. “Together, we look forward to investing in and enhancing our operations, guest experience, and brand.”\n\nGolden Gate Capital purchased Bob Evans in 2017 for $565 million. At the time, the firm split the restaurants from Bob Evans Farms, the brand’s consumer-packaged good business, which was acquired by Post Holdings for $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2022, Golden Gate explored a potential $600 million sale of the restaurant chain, though a transaction did not materialize. Reports in 2024 indicated the company had hired investment bank Kroll to oversee another sale process.\n\n“We are truly grateful to the terrific team at Bob Evans for their strong stewardship of this iconic brand,” said Neale Attenborough, a managing director at Golden Gate. “We wish the team all the best as they enter their next phase of growth.”\n\n‘Love is Blind’ fans buzzing over central Ohio ties\n\nBob Evans boasts itself as a farm-inspired, family-style restaurant brand known for breakfast offerings, such as its Farmer’s Choice Breakfast, and roasted turkey dinners.\n\n4×4 Capital, founded in 2018, focuses on investing in middle-market consumer goods and services companies across North America. The firm said it takes an active ownership approach aimed at accelerating growth and operational performance.\n\n“What truly sets the Bob Evans brand apart is its distinctive hospitality, welcoming ambiance, and fresh, flavorful food — delivering real value for the whole family,” said Gustavo Assumpção, co-founder and partner at 4×4 Capital, who will serve as executive board chair. “We look forward to partnering with Mickey and the team to maximize long-term growth.”",

    "fullText": "New York Jets fans have come to terms with the fact that Sam Darnold was better off elsewhere. The former No. 3 overall selection has done a fantastic job reviving his career since leaving the Jets. All of Darnold's hard work culminated in winning Super Bowl LX with the Seattle Seahawks this past weekend.\n\nDarnold has kept it classy at every turn when discussing his tumultuous tenure with the Jets during Super Bowl media week. The Seahawks held their Super Bowl 60-winning parade in downtown Seattle on Wednesday. As per usual, Darnold was faced with occasional questions about the Jets in the wake of winning his first Lombardi Trophy.\n\nOne particular question and clip has rightfully gone viral. Justin Fried of The Jet Press asked Darnold if he had a message to Jets fans who have continued to support him despite things not working out between player and franchise. Darnold provided the most heartwarming response imaginable.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Darnold started with. “I always look at myself and feel like I could’ve done a lot more for that franchise. The fact that [Jets fans] are able to support me even through that means a lot.”\n\nCongratulations to Darnold on winning Super Bowl LX!\n\nI asked Sam Darnold if he had a message to #Jets fans who have continued to support him:\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“I always look at myself and feel like I could’ve done a lot more for that franchise.”\n\n“The fact that [Jets fans] are able to support me even through that means a lot.” pic.twitter.com/AtOsbghHJN\n\n— Justin Fried (@JustinTFried) February 10, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Sam Darnold had the most heartwarming message for Jets fans",

    "description": "A New York City parent explains why she paid $7,500 for a part-time toddler program to ease separation anxiety before 3-K. She says it was worth it.",
    "fullText": "When I first found out I was pregnant, I frankly didn't put much thought into long-term childcare plans. Living in New York City, my husband and I knew we wouldn't have the traditional village available to us — my parents, while local and thrilled to get a first grandchild, are older and weren't particularly eager to volunteer for solo babysitting, while his parents live thousands of miles away.\n\nBut we were in a uniquely lucky situation: We both happened to have flexible, largely remote jobs.\n\nFor the first few months of my surprisingly generous parental leave, my husband and I, cocooned in newborn bliss (and perhaps slightly delirious from sleep deprivation), didn't stress about what would happen when I went back to work. I figured we could make it work through a combination of creative time management and strategically scheduled naps — at least until our daughter was eligible for 3-K, free schooling available in New York City for kids the year they turn 3.\n\nSurprisingly, this plan ended up working, for the most part, and for just shy of a year, we managed a fairly even 50-50 split in parenting duties. As time went on and my own work ramped up and the baby potato turned into a sprinting toddler, it became clear that my husband would need to become the primary parent.\n\nIt wasn't something either of us had considered before having a child, but it made the most sense: He found far greater fulfillment in being a father than he'd ever found in his career, whereas I had always defined myself by my work as a writer and editor. He kept his job but scaled back, working largely in the evenings and weekends so he could be free during the day for stay-at-home parenting.\n\nAs our daughter became a toddler, she blossomed under my husband's full-time care, with constant adventuring and frequent playdates keeping her days busy. We didn't need outside childcare — but as it turned out, she did.\n\nNew York City has notoriously high childcare costs.\n\nIn the interim between our delicate balancing act and deciding my husband would drastically scale down his work, I considered a number of different options, from traditional daycares (upward of $2,500 a month in my neighborhood for full-time programs) to nanny-share arrangements with other local families (maybe slightly cheaper, but a pain to coordinate).\n\nWe were lucky in that we were able to avoid childcare costs, which would have effectively canceled out one of our salaries, though I still toyed with the idea of enrolling her somewhere part time to get her used to the idea in case our situation changed.\n\nEnter Barnard College's Center for Toddler Development.\n\nI first heard about the program in a local moms' book club I'd joined. One of our first reads was \"How Toddlers Thrive\" by Tovah P. Klein, a prominent child psychologist — and incidentally the then-director of the Toddler Center. Another mom in the book club with a daughter two years older than mine mentioned she was now applying.\n\nI was frankly flabbergasted when she explained the details. It's part research program, where the toddlers are minded by teachers and selected students from the college's graduate program and observed for published research purposes from behind a one-way mirror, and part \"school,\" albeit an extremely part-time one, with each \"class\" of toddlers meeting only twice a week for two hours each day for the duration of the school year.\n\nI was intrigued by the program's unique \"gentle separation period\" and its said mission to help toddlers have a positive first school experience while supporting healthy social and emotional development through hands-on, child-guided play.\n\nAt that point, my daughter was only 18 months old (the halfway point to our 3-K end goal), but I'd already started to suspect that separation might be an eventual issue. With two working-from-home parents, she was used to having us around constantly — and had never had a babysitter.\n\nThe few times we'd tried to step out to grab a coffee and handed her to a grandparent, she would shriek like she was being abandoned. Over the next several months, she also grew more shy, coinciding with her stranger danger peaking.\n\nConvinced our future would be filled with school refusals and drop-off meltdowns, I hardcore pitched the Toddler Center to my husband for the coming school year. We didn't need it for childcare, but I became convinced we did need it to help give our daughter the gentlest, most gradual introduction to being away from us. He was less convinced, sure she would grow out of it and be OK with separating by 3-K, but agreed in the end.\n\nIf the program details were mind-boggling, the price point was eye-watering. Though there isn't a set, publicly announced tuition rate, the Toddler Center offers sliding-scale tuition and payment plans to make the program accessible to a broader range of the population. According to its website, a third of Toddler Center families pay tuition on a sliding scale (I assume the higher-profile alum parents like Amy Schumer, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Robert De Niro paid full sticker price for their kids to attend).\n\nAfter submitting a sliding-scale tuition application, which required forking over the previous year's tax returns to prove we were indeed not flush with cash, we landed on $7,500 as the final figure for our almost 2-year-old to take her first baby steps toward school.\n\nThe first few weeks of the program allowed the parents in the classroom, gradually moving us farther from it (a separate, no-toys-allowed room in the back, meant to be unappealing to the kids) to encourage the toddlers to ignore them and play in the main classroom area. That trick didn't work on our daughter, who simply sat next to the chair of whichever of us had taken her in that day, chattering happily as we tried to gently encourage her to go away.\n\nAs I'd dreaded, the initial actual separation — when parents would bring their kids into the classroom and tell them they were leaving — was horrendous. The Toddler Center mandated that only one parent or caregiver drop off their child each morning.\n\nFor the first few weeks after separation, we could both sit in the observation room, where we were treated to a front-row show of our daughter sobbing hysterically and trying to reason with the grad students to open the door she was convinced we were right behind. It was excruciating, and plenty of tears were shed on our end as well.\n\nThere was virtually no improvement for months, which was far longer than I expected. And I felt an immense amount of guilt for having come up with this idea in the first place: Were we actually traumatizing her instead of helping her? Had I epically miscalculated this? Did I pay $7,500 to torture my toddler and myself?\n\nI was wracked with doubt, and we debated withdrawing her from the program before the first semester had even finished. It was particularly hard on my husband, who, as the primary parent, was typically the one dropping her off and dealing with the meltdowns — and who also really missed her on school days.\n\nSuddenly, though, and for no particular reason at all, it got better. A lot better.\n\nInstead of sobbing by the door for a full hour and a half, she started interacting with the other kids. She found a favorite grad student she'd attach herself to. She played happily on the classroom slide. And eventually, she comforted the other toddlers during their hard separation days, assuring them their mommies or daddies would be back.\n\nWhile it was difficult for my husband to be apart from his little buddy for the few hours a week she was at the program, they turned it into an opportunity for new adventures. In the spring semester, he began biking with her to school, stopping to pick up flowers on the way there and back. Another tradition became that he would bring her a blueberry muffin from a local café every day at pickup. These small rituals helped them bond even more.\n\nI don't pretend to have a handle on the intricacies of toddler psychology, and I can't tell you what the flipped-switch moment was where it finally clicked for my kid that being left at school with her teachers didn't mean we were gone forever. And yes, for the record, she still cried during drop-off the first few weeks of 3-K.\n\nBut I am convinced that completing the Toddler Center program drastically reduced her adjustment period for \"real school.\" Tossing her into the deep end for six hours a day, five days a week, was simply not the right option for our family.\n\nIn the end, I'm glad I listened to my gut, dug into our pockets, and toughed out the tears — and I'd like to think my daughter, somewhere deep down in her toddler brain, is too.",

    "fullText": "There was a time I thought I'd spend the rest of my life in New York.\n\nAfter more than a decade in Manhattan, the streets felt like my own, and my identity felt entwined with the city.\n\nEven after having two babies on the Upper West Side, I was constantly plotting and planning on how we could make this lifestyle work long-term.\n\nAnd then, my husband and I stumbled upon our dream home in a distant Connecticut suburb.\n\nI was four months postpartum with my second son, and with two kids, I was no longer able to get the stroller down the three sets of stairs to get out of our building myself.\n\nThough I loved that my routine included walks in Central Park and my oldest had learned to ride a scooter along the Hudson River, I couldn't deny the appeal of a real backyard and a kitchen with an adult-sized fridge.\n\nThere were days when I swore I could feel the walls of our 750-square-foot apartment caving in, but could we really make the move to the 'burbs?\n\nWe both worked full time — I as a journalist, and my husband in finance. Even though our jobs only required us to be in the office two or three times a week, the distance was still daunting, and commutes would be at least an hour each way.\n\nPlus, what would it mean to remove ourselves from the city's vibrant energy? Would we lose ourselves?\n\nStill a little unsure, we decided it was an opportunity we couldn't pass up. On my second son's first day of day care, I dropped him off with teary eyes, and we drove an hour north to close on a four-bedroom home.\n\nWe gained more than three times the physical space of our apartment in the move, but the real gain was the mental space that opened up.\n\nOur day-care bill was almost halved. My kids traded in Riverside Park for their own driveway and a quiet street where they learned to ride bikes.\n\nI was no longer in a constant state of figuring out logistics or trying to find affordable ways for us to get out. We could invite people over to our house, we could barbecue in our backyard, we could even walk 20 minutes to the beach … for free.\n\nEven though we offset our day-care savings with our new mortgage, life felt undeniably more accessible.\n\nI felt myself start to breathe a little easier. I stopped constantly focusing on how to make more money and advance my career. For the first time in my adult life, everything we had was enough.\n\nThat same settled feeling that brought me peace in the suburbs also felt like a little bit of a loss.\n\nThere's a sense of anticipation in every conversation I had with friends in New York — anticipation for a shoot to wrap, for the perfect apartment to appear, for a deal to close.\n\nIt is a feeling built on ambition, dreams, and the shared experience of sacrificing a little bit of life's comforts to be a part of something bigger than yourself. That feeling lit me up when we were in the city, and connected me to my most creative self.\n\nLeaving the city meant we could no longer catch a last-minute Broadway show or easily see the latest exhibit at the Met. We had to consider job opportunities in a whole new way, and as a journalist, that meant accepting that I couldn't pursue certain roles that would require odd hours in the office anymore.\n\nHowever, most of all, I have missed the sense of belonging I felt before the move.\n\nOn the Upper West Side, I had enjoyed a spirit of communal parenting with my neighbors. No matter the weather or time of year, we were always out at a museum or a playground, meeting up with other families.\n\nWhen you live in such tiny spaces, your kids celebrate milestones at restaurants and rented spaces. You're all in it together.\n\nIn the suburbs, once the temperatures dropped, I felt everyone around me burrow into their homes and didn't see them again until spring. It's hard to make new connections when families aren't gathering at the beaches and playgrounds for large swaths of the year.\n\nWith more space came a greater distance from my peers, which made building a new community feel out of reach.\n\nThe energy of New York was the thing I loved most about it. It was also what exhausted me. Once we had kids, the life I wanted felt too far out of reach. The cost of living, too much.\n\nWith a move to the suburbs, our quality of life improved, and the air still feels more breathable.\n\nThe downsides are real — the commute is long, the proximity to our creative fields feels far, and I have struggled to find my community in a place that has felt more isolating than NYC.\n\nHowever, the tradeoffs are just as real. With more space came more peace, more stability, and more financial opportunity.\n\nWe lost some things in the move, but we didn't lose ourselves. And I like to think we brought a little bit of that New York spark with us.",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings traded defensive tackle Harrison Phillips to the New York Jets last summer, a shocking transaction because fans believed the team held Phillips in the highest regard. And when Phillips arrived in New York, he quickly realized the grass wasn’t greener on the other side.\n\nPhillips’ comments put the Vikings’ former captain back in the spotlight and raise questions about the Jets’ tone.\n\nThe veteran lineman told all this week, sparing his head coach, Aaron Glenn, from criticism but noting a markedly different atmosphere from his time in Minnesota and Buffalo.\n\nIt’s a story of the Jets being “the Jets.”\n\nPhillips spoke to Roundtable Sports on Radio Row last week, and he wasn’t shy about revealing the truth.\n\nHe said about his employer, “I think Aaron Glenn inherited a very cancerous, truculent group — whole, top to bottom. It’s not individual people’s fault. I was there for one season — it was a very difficult season — and I almost wanted to waver on some of my thoughts and my beliefs and my optimism.”\n\n“So, I can’t imagine being there for year after year after year after year and not seeing the results that you wanted, and it tainted people. Because my coach is going to get fired, my teammate’s going to get fired, I’m going to be a free agent, I might get fired, I have to play for me, I have to make sure my tape is hot regardless of what the system is asking me to do, what the scheme is telling me to do.”\n\nMany Jets fans saw the interview and thought, “Sounds about right.”\n\nPhillips added, “Then, young players come in and see, ‘Oh, that’s my vet, that’s how they’re acting, so that’s the way I’m going to act, too.’ It’s a long chain of things, and it can’t be fixed like that.”\n\n“I think AG’s mindset, of any coach I’ve been around, to deal with what we had to deal with this season and be as consistent as he was to us throughout that whole thing, was super cool to see,”\n\nUnless he’s released, Phillips can’t quite get out of New York; he’s scheduled to be a free agent in 2027.\n\nOn August 20th, ESPN’s Adam Schefter tweeted: “ESPN sources: Vikings are trading DT Harrison Phillips and a 2027 7th-round pick to the New York Jets in exchange for a 2026 6th-round pick and a 2027 6th-round pick, pending Phillips’ physical. Phillips now joins Jowon Briggs as the second DT that the Jets traded for Wednesday.”\n\nFans checked to ensure the tweet wasn’t from a parody account because — why would Minnesota trade Phillips?\n\nThe defense wound up ranking third in the NFL in EPA per play, so losing Phillips wasn’t a death sentence, but there were times throughout the 2025 campaign when Phillips’s run defense would’ve come in handy. Now, for their troubles, the Vikings will get a pair of extra 6th-Round picks, which, for all intents and purposes, nobody really cares about.\n\nIn the Twin Cities, Phillips earned respect as a team captain and tone-setter. He justified his contract by providing stability at defensive tackle when the Vikings struggled with inconsistency at the position. He steadied the middle of the defensive line when it sometimes faltered.\n\nOff the field, he became the organization’s most visible humanitarian, consistently investing time and resources into community work. Over 51 games in Minnesota, the 29-year-old recorded 207 tackles, 17 quarterback hits, and 6.5 sacks, also serving as a cultural pillar in the locker room.\n\nPhillips personally played well in New York last season — go figure — but his team stunk. Utterly stunk. The Jets started 0-7, basically eliminating themselves from postseason contention by Halloween, and finished the campaign with a horrid 3-14 record.\n\nIn recent weeks, Glenn has fired almost all of his coaching staff, so whatever culture he hoped to fix per the cancerous Phillips observation will start from scratch in 2026.\n\nPhillips banked a 72.5 grade from Pro Football Focus. He did his part. It’s also worth noting that Phillips, until 2025, spent his entire career with the Bills and Vikings. Playing for a bottom-feeder was new territory — that he evidently didn’t enjoy.\n\nWhat’s Next for Phillips & the Jets?\n\nPhillips can escape from New York next offseason, and he’ll be 31 when it’s time to sign his next contract. Unless the Jets trade him in the upcoming months, he’s stuck contractually.\n\nFor the Jets’ overall outlook, well, they’re in a familiar spot. They need a quarterback. Justin Fields and Tyrod Taylor held down the fort in 2025, but all that led to was a 3-14 record. In the coming weeks and months, New York can pursue a passer via trade like Mac Jones or Kyler Murray, sign Malik Willis from free agency, or explore the draft for a signal-caller like Ty Simpson, Carson Beck, or Trinidad Chambliss.\n\nNew York has the third-lowest Super Bowl odds for next year, with a +20000 moneyline, only besting the Miami Dolphins and Arizona Cardinals.",

    "description": "The New York Times argued that it was \"time to acknowledge reality\" and \"admit\" that the United States has a \"marijuana problem\" in a new editorial.",
    "fullText": "The New York Times argued that it was “time to acknowledge reality” and “admit” that the United States has a “marijuana problem” in a new editorial admitting that the legalization of weed in most states has had a wide variety of adverse consequences.\n\n“This editorial board has long supported marijuana legalization. In 2014, we published a six-part series that compared the federal marijuana ban to alcohol prohibition and argued for repeal. Much of what we wrote then holds up — but not all of it does,” began the Times. “At the time, supporters of legalization predicted that it would bring few downsides. In our editorials, we described marijuana addiction and dependence as ‘relatively minor problems.’ Many advocates went further and claimed that marijuana was a harmless drug that might even bring net health benefits. They also said that legalization might not lead to greater use.”\n\n“It is now clear that many of these predictions were wrong. Legalization has led to much more use. Surveys suggest that about 18 million people in the United States have used marijuana almost daily (or about five times a week) in recent years. That was up from around six million in 2012 and less than one million in 1992. More Americans now use marijuana daily than alcohol,” it acknowledged. “This wider use has caused a rise in addiction and other problems. Each year, nearly 2.8 million people in the United States suffer from cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, which causes severe vomiting and stomach pain. More people have also ended up in hospitals with marijuana-linked paranoia and chronic psychotic disorders. Bystanders have also been hurt, including by people driving under the influence of pot.”\n\nInstead of calling for a total rollback that would recriminalize the sale and use of the drug, the Gray Lady advocated a policy of “grudging toleration” that might upset “Big Weed,” which, it argues has “a financial incentive to mislead the public about what they are selling.”\n\n“Marijuana companies, not casual smokers, are the biggest winners of Mr. Trump’s decision to reclassify the drug from Schedule I to Schedule III. The change will increase the profits of these businesses by causing the tax code to treat them more favorably. This does not qualify as grudging toleration,” it submitted before concluding: “The unfortunate truth is that the loosening of marijuana policies — especially the decision to legalize pot without adequately regulating it — has led to worse outcomes than many Americans expected. It is time to acknowledge reality and change course.”\n\nThe post ‘Time to Acknowledge Reality’: The New York Times Warns America Has a ‘Marijuana Problem’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

The unit returned to playing up to traditional Giants standards, earning praise for its improved performance despite limited wins.\n\nBullen described serving as DC as a \"great honor and privilege,\" focusing on hard work and player development rather than external validation. His success drew widespread interest, including prior interview requests from the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals.\n\nUnder new Giants head coach John Harbaugh, Bullen was retained on staff -- amid a broader coaching purge -- but primarily as outside linebackers coach.\n\nTeams cannot block promotional interviews, positioning Bullen as a rising candidate for full-time coordinator opportunities.

    "description": "A super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and other tech leaders has targeted New York Assembly member Alex Bores' congressional campaign, marking its first attack against a lawmaker supporting AI regulation.",
    "fullText": "A pro-AI super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman has chosen New York Assembly member Alex Bores — and his congressional bid — as its first target.\n\nThe PAC, dubbed Leading the Future, formed in August with a more than $100 million commitment to support policymakers with a light-touch — or a no-touch — approach to AI regulation. And that means going after policymakers who want to regulate AI. The super PAC has backing from a number of other prominent leaders in tech, including Palantir co-founder and 8VC managing partner Joe Lonsdale as well as AI search engine Perplexity.\n\n“I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it,” Bores told a room of journalists Monday evening at a Journalism Workshop on AGI impacts and governance in Washington, D.C. “When they say, ‘Hey, we’re going to spend millions against Alex because he might regulate Big Tech and put basic guardrails on AI,’ I just basically forward that to my constituents.”\n\nBores, who’s running to represent the state’s 12th Congressional District, said AI anxieties are on the rise among his constituents, who worry about everything from data centers pushing up utility bills and worsening climate change to chatbots impacting kids’ mental health and automation transforming the job market.\n\nBores is the chief sponsor of New York’s bipartisan RAISE Act, which requires large AI labs to have a safety plan in place to prevent critical harms, follow their own safety plan, and disclose critical safety incidents, like bad actors stealing an AI model. The bill also prohibits AI firms from releasing models with unreasonable risks of critical harm and imposes civil penalties of up to $30 million if companies fail to live up to these standards. The legislation is currently awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature.\n\nBores said while drafting and redrafting the bill, he consulted with the large AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. Those negotiations led to the removal of provisions like third-party safety audits, which he says the industry refused to accept. Nevertheless, the RAISE Act, and Bores himself, appears to have incurred the ire of Silicon Valley.\n\nZac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, heads of Leading the Future, told Politico that they would work on a multibillion-dollar effort to sink Bores’ campaign.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch, they accused Bores of advancing “ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation.” The pair said “bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.”\n\n“The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,” Moffatt and Vlasto said in the emailed statement. “America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users.”\n\nMany in Silicon Valley have pushed to prohibit states from passing regulation that relates to AI. Earlier this year, a provision blocking state AI laws was slipped into the federal budget bill and was later removed. Now, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz are seeking to resurrect it through other legislative avenues.\n\nBores said he is concerned such a movement could continue to gain legs at a time when the federal government has passed no meaningful AI regulation. Where federal government moves slow, states are like startups — they can function as policy laboratories and move fast to test what works.\n\n“The question should be, has Congress solved the problem?” Bores said. “If Congress solves the problem, then it can tell the states to get out of the way, but if they’re not going to pass a bill that’s actually addressing any of the problems…and then [saying that states can’t do anything] that just doesn’t make sense to me.”\n\nBores also noted he has been in contact with policymakers in other states to work on standardizing legislation, which could combat Silicon Valley’s “patchwork” objection. He also believes that lawmakers should ensure there are no redundancies with the EU AI Act.\n\nBores emphasized that AI regulation isn’t meant to limit innovation, and that he has rejected bills that he thinks would have unintended consequences for the industry.\n\n“Having basic rules of the road, literal or metaphorical, is actually a very pro-innovation stance if done well,” Bores said. “I fundamentally believe that the AI that wins is going to be the AI that is trustworthy. And the pushback from industry to say that government has no role in establishing that trust is one that I think you’re seeing people reject at every level.”",

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nAhead of the much-anticipated bout between the Seahawks and the New England Patriots, Booker had an exchange with model Kendall Jenner on Instagram that added a new twist to the big game. Jenner released a betting campaign with Fanatics Sportsbook, leaning into a long-running joke about her past relationship history with NBA players — including the Suns star.\n\nWhile promoting it on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Jenner picked the Patriots to win the Super Bowl.\n\nJan 7, 2026; Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker (1) drives to the basket as Memphis Grizzlies forward Jaylen Wells (0) defends during the first quarter at FedExForum.

Known as a leader for the Suns and a franchise cornerstone, Booker’s ability to bring lightheartedness and sarcasm into the moment showcases his personality off the court.\n\nEven between those who have shared a past, being able to poke fun, look back and share a laugh is something worth noting.\n\nCardinals’ Budda Baker weighs in on Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl Halftime Show",

    "fullText": "Black and trans drag performers are crowdfunding to survive in one of the most expensive cities in the world.\n\nAfter he somersaults on the bar in six-inch stilettos and a blood-stained, Chucky’s-bride-themed white corset, the crowd at Bushwick’s queer-owned Pink Metal Bar roars in delight for Xaddy Addy, a Black transmasculine drag king and sideshow performer. The audience has gathered in the intimate bar for Superstar Open Set’s Halloween show, an open stage that Xaddy Addy cohosts each week alongside drag performer Pachacvnti. After a night of performances from Brooklyn’s emerging talent, the crowd remains spellbound as Xaddy Addy staples cash tips to his cheeks, thighs, and hips. Not even the loud cheering drowns out the clack of the staple gun as it pierces his skin. His self-assured, “weird” drag performance—an expansive genre melding drag with horror, stunts, and complex dramaturgy—belies the economic insecurity and discrimination he faced while building a following.\n\nManhattan native Xaddy Addy tells me that drag was “a way to save his life” after years of doing sex work “100 percent out of survival.” For many, drag is both a calling and an art form—one that contributes to New York’s $35 billion nightlife economy. But income from their performances barely covers their bills in one of the most expensive cities in the world, where the average rent soars beyond $3,000. Many Black and trans performers are crowdfunding on social media to cover rent, medical bills, and groceries.\n\n“You have some of the best Black trans drag performers in the world in your city,” says Klondyke, a Black drag artist and sideshow performer. “Why are they starving? Why am I seeing more people that are Black and trans posting mutual aid than posting shows that they’re in?”\n\nWith the election of Mayor Zohran Mamdani, drag artists are hopeful about his promises to make the city more affordable, by freezing rent for stabilized housing, and to expand protections for trans New Yorkers. But they argue that policy changes alone will not be enough to undo decades of decisions that have disenfranchised the city’s marginalized residents. That will take all of us.\n\nDrag performance artists occupy a precarious ledge in New York’s gentrified landscape. The city’s exorbitant costs of living, along with Trump’s despotic policies, have caused residents and tourists to opt out of live entertainment. “I can’t tell you how many shows I’ve been a part of that have been well promoted, the promo’s gorgeous, the cast is posting, the tickets are not too expensive,” Bri Joy, a drag king and go-go dancer, says. “All the conditions are correct for a beautiful day at the beach, and then no one shows up at the beach.”\n\nBut Black and brown artists have faced decades of discrimination over the years, long before Donald Trump kicked off his crusade against trans people. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Afrosephone, a showgirl from New York, remembers, “the girls and the dolls went to work” across swaths of Manhattan—from the West Side Piers to the iconic La Escuelita on West 39th Street. By contrast, white venues permitted Black or Latine people only on designated nights. These clubs “were a thousand times worse back then,” Afrosephone says, “where they could be openly racist to you.” Black and brown artists forged their own spaces underground, and their contributions to nightlife attracted tourists, a new generation of queer transplants, and, inevitably, the cops.\n\nIn response to the proliferation of underground clubbing, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani disproportionately raided Black and brown clubs for dancing, smoking, or playing loud music. He also wiped the dust off the Prohibition-era Cabaret Law, which outlaws dancing in venues without a pricey cabaret license. Giuliani’s policies, ostensibly aimed to reduce crime, sought to attract wealthy transplants and business owners to the city. Mayor Mike Bloomberg continued these draconian measures into the early 2010s. A long battle with the NY State Liquor Authority ended in La Escuelita’s untimely closing in 2016, only a year before Mayor Bill de Blasio finally repealed the Cabaret Law.\n\nThe NYPD’s crusade on Black and brown clubs robbed performers of cultural sanctuary and employment options. Real estate developers and culture-hungry newcomers flocked to pick at the ruins. Venue owners and event producers shut Black performers out of regimented clubs, where partygoers shuffled into VIP sections, hardly danced, and snapped photos of ostentatious bottle service. Today, Black and trans artists continue to face discriminatory hiring practices.\n\nBri Joy says that many promoters adhere to the “paper bag test”—if a drag performer’s skin is darker than a paper bag, then they’re turned away from certain clubs. Trans artists face compounded scrutiny from audiences and other drag performers, who have asked Bri Joy probing questions like “What kind of trans are you?” and outed Afrosephone on stage without her consent.\n\n“Even now, especially in Manhattan, there can only be one or two top Black performers at a time,” Afrosephone says. “We’re at the mercy of these establishments that don’t truly want to work with us.”\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio’s relatively progressive policy decisions led to ephemeral gains for drag artists. Along with expanding labor rights and housing protections, de Blasio founded the Office of Nightlife (ONL) to support workers and local business development after dark.\n\nWhen Covid restrictions were lifted in 2021, Klondyke recalls that “a lot of corporate and white money” was being “thrown at drag” programs. Diverse drag lineups attracted audiences who toted stimulus checks and a nascent, if not fleeting, solidarity with people of color after the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020. “I was doing at least three or four shows a week for over a year, and that was able to sustain me,” Klondyke says. “Then it just starts to fizzle.” Once the news cycle closed the chapter on racial justice, so did the city’s doors and wallets.\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Michael Kazin\n\nEric Adams pledged to revive the nightlife economy when he was elected mayor in 2022. During his term, he frequently appeared at swanky Midtown venues where he dined on branzino with his inner circle, including convicted fraudsters and former Governor Andrew Cuomo—whose tenure saw steep increases in housing costs and a decline in the number of Black residents.\n\nThe New York City Council sued Adams for blocking legislation to offer more housing vouchers and recently overruled his proposal to hike Section 8 rents. His $650 million campaign to combat street homelessness raises questions about the plan’s execution, given that his former policies led to increased policing in subway stations and forced displacements of unhoused people.\n\nAdams, to his credit, led the transition from Giuliani’s authoritarian MARCH program, in which police cracked down on clubs without warning, to CURE, an initiative that mediates nightlife violations before resorting to harsh police enforcement. While these measures bridge the gap between city government and nightlife venues, Adams’ administration failed to meaningfully address the most pertinent threats to nightlife workers: housing insecurity and finding safe, steady work.\n\n“There have been one or two times where I’ve had a bout of unemployment and I’ve tried to make it work with just nightlife,” says Bri Joy. “I owed so much back rent and I was the brokest I’d ever been in my life. It was the first time that I’d really seen my account hit actual zero.”\n\nEven New York’s “Freelance Isn’t Free” law, which protects freelancers’ rights, requires written contracts only for projects of $800 or more with a single employer. But underground drag artists often earn up to a couple hundred dollars from gigs, if they’re paid at all, and recurring bookings are difficult to come by. In August 2024, the ONL reported that its efforts to expand affordability for DIY spaces were “currently on hold”—despite the fact that increased access to venues would help drag performers and producers like Vague Static create more employment opportunities.\n\n“It’s gonna be a lot easier a lot of the time for a white producer to get into the clubs, to produce a thing, and pay the people,” says Vague Static. They are a co-organizer of Lil’ Park Drag Show, a free program that took a hiatus this year following a spike in transphobic safety threats. “I do not have the money to pay the people for their time.”\n\nA 2019 ONL study reports that income stability and gig competition pose substantial hurdles to 80 percent of nightlife entertainers, and drag is especially cutthroat. Individualism, prejudice, and poor conflict resolution within the drag community—even among other LGBTQ+ people of color—widen the gaps of public policy failures.\n\nDrag kings in particular are disregarded and underpaid compared to drag queens and well-known entertainers, who use “words like community and friendship to get close to you,” only to disappear when they find “a better booking,” according to Klondyke. These discrepancies have material consequences. In January, after Klondyke failed to secure consistent work and accumulated $10,000 in unpaid rent, his landlord evicted him and his partner from their Brooklyn apartment. “Our income is very sporadic,” reads Klondyke’s fundraiser for housing costs. “We are at the end of our rope.” Although Klondyke began fundraising in 2024, his campaign is still less than halfway to its goal, and his search for secure housing wears on.\n\n“When you become silent, you fall into the similar categories of the rising conservatism that we see in this country,” Xaddy Addy says. “People are left to feel alone and invisible and think to themselves, what does it even mean to be in these spaces? What does it even mean to exist in this life?”\n\nFor as long as Black trans artists have existed in New York City, they have addressed their uncertain living situations with community-based solutions. In 1968, drag queen Crystal LaBeija created the House of LaBeija—an artist-led collective that offered mentorship and support networks to Black trans talent—to resist the racial discrimination she faced in ballroom pageants, where women of color lightened their faces to compete for white judges only to lose to non-Black talent. LaBeija’s house system was the first of its kind, not only launching drag to international acclaim but offering a blueprint for how drag artists can support each other in moments of need. “There would be no ballroom or drag culture without Crystal LaBeija,” says Afrosephone.\n\nDuring the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, performers relied on drag collectives, where drag artists shared costumes, exchanged industry knowledge, and hosted in-person events like “Takes the Cake,” “a drag competition for drag king, things, and other non-binary & queer performers.” Klondyke, who “came up in the time of collectives” and won Takes the Cake in 2021, recalls the electrifying presence these opportunities carried, “especially for kings and things,” who were “excited to have spaces to do our thing.”\n\nThe Cake Boys, the drag collective behind Takes the Cake, had to shutter their live event programming in 2024, but other underground initiatives have sprouted up to fulfill drag artists’ needs. More recently, Klondyke and Xaddy Addy cofounded Black Cherry Sideshow, the first-ever trans and BIPOC-led drag sideshow, alongside drag artists Selena Surreal and Oliver Herface. The quartet performs every second Saturday of the month at Purgatory Bar in Bushwick, where they engage in a dizzying range of stunts like eating fire, lying on beds of nails, and taking needles and mouse traps to their bare flesh. With an historic one-year anniversary event held last May on Coney Island, Black Cherry Sideshow dares to reimagine the sideshow not as an exploitative spectacle for white consumption but a way for trans performers of color to reclaim their power and, according to Xaddy Addy, “raise the stakes in my drag in a dangerous but safe way.” Along with his sideshow grind, both Xaddy Addy and Afrosephone host open sets to uplift up-and-coming drag artists, while others circulate calls for mutual aid.\n\n“Being a drag performer, I’d much rather [use] art to fight through a fascist system instead of making art to appease a fascist system,” Klondyke says. “The fact that my art is able to exist as a Black trans person is what is political.”\n\nDrag is inextricable from the city’s anti-fascist future. Zohran Mamdani’s use of relationship-building, volunteerism, and media to build power mirrors the tactics of Black and trans-led collectives throughout New York’s history.\n\nSo far, Mamdani has acted on some of his campaign promises and fallen short on others. Although Mamdani called to defund the “racist and anti-queer” NYPD on X in 2020, he roused criticism from progressives after choosing to retain Jessica Tisch, a moderate who increased surveillance across the city and opposes bail reform efforts, as the NYPD commissioner. The decision to maintain Eric Adams’s pro-NYPD appointment, along with his delayed, lackluster response to two fatal police shootings days into his term, cast suspicion over whether he’ll follow through on his pledge to protect New Yorkers who are most vulnerable to police violence.\n\nHe has made more hopeful strides in the realm of nightlife and entertainment, where he elected Freelancers Union leader Rafael Espinal as commissioner of the New York City Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment. Espinal led the charge to repeal the Cabaret Law and pass the Freelance Isn’t Free Act as a city councillor under Bill de Blasio. The native Brooklynite’s track record of inclusive policy reforms, along with his recent promises to expand affordability for NYC creatives, seek to meaningfully address the cost-of-living catastrophe that worsened under Adams’ administration.\n\nYet policy changes alone are never enough. True power, as Mamdani even emphasized on his campaign trail, lies in the hands of the people.\n\nNew Yorkers have a responsibility to show up and stand down for nightlife performers by attending drag shows run by Black trans performers, tipping and paying entertainers living wages, and advocating for inclusive hiring practices.\n\n“You shouldn’t wait until somebody is on Drag Race to show your support,” says Afrosephone. “The one thing that will keep us performing, the one thing that will keep us afloat, is if you show up.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "description": "Former Real Housewives of New York star Bethenny Frankel moved to Florida last year. She's in her 'nightgown era' and is building a dating community.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 55-year-old Bethenny Frankel, former star of The Real Housewives of New York City and founder of The Core, a private dating membership community. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have a much bigger business now than when I was on The Real Housewives of New York City, was running Skinnygirl, my lifestyle brand famous for its low-calorie cocktails, and landed on the cover of Forbes.\n\nI got a big one-time check when I sold the liquor arm of Skinnygirl, but what I'm doing now, through The Core, my private dating membership community, influencing, and investing, is bigger than ever.\n\nI'm busy, but I'm not sitting at a desk every day. My brain works well, I have a phone, and that's really all I need. I wrote most of my New York Times bestselling books on a BlackBerry.\n\nHere's a typical day in my life.\n\nI wake up fairly early. I let the dogs out, then go give my daughter a hug and a kiss if she lets me in her room for a second. I really love that. I tend to troll her by sitting on her bed for a few minutes, but I've learned that teens don't like to talk in the morning.\n\nI make myself a strong iced coffee with my Cumulus coffee maker and feed the dogs. My dogs are really important to me, and I try to get as many good snuggles in with them as I can.\n\nBetween 7:30 and 8:30 a.m., I usually go for a walk on the beach. I moved from New York to South Florida in March 2025, and I love wandering around like a weirdo on the beach. I often finish the walks by jumping into the sea.\n\nI like taking calls while walking on the beach. In the morning, these are usually with one team member handling brand partnerships and appearances, and with my COO, where we discuss bigger deals, contract negotiations, and my investments.\n\nSince we launched The Core in December, it's taken up a big part of my day. It brings together the trust I've built as an entrepreneur with my crazy Rolodex of incredibly powerful and successful people.\n\nI'm passionate about it, and passion is my thing. When I start obsessing over something — it was the same with BStrong, my disaster-relief initiative I launched in 2017 in response to that year's devastating hurricane season — it's the only thing I'm talking about.\n\nLike every other business I've run, it's a case of building the plane while flying it. A lot of the work involves responding to texts and voice-noting somebody, asking them to do something.\n\nIf someone wants to get on the phone with me, I'll often take the call while I'm in the car. Otherwise, that time is wasted, and I don't waste time, food, or money.\n\nMy days aren't tightly structured, and I don't like feeling shackled by having too many things I have to do. The day often gets away from me before I've even showered, and my team will remind me that I have 15 minutes until I need to record my podcast, \"Just B with Bethenny Frankel.\"\n\nI record the episodes at home. Mostly, I don't care about having guests on. If I talk about my pillowcases and the bacterial facial infection I got on vacation, it will rate just as well as having Madonna.\n\nI'll usually rant for about an hour. I only like to sit and talk about what I want to talk about. It's almost like my own personal therapy monologue.\n\nThis year, I've been more open to meeting people for meals and coffee.\n\nOtherwise, I have my \"supermodel snacks\" for lunch, often seaweed stuffed with salad or turkey or rice cakes with avocado or cottage cheese.\n\nI don't plan to record my social media videos; it's mostly spontaneous. I don't post them as much as I used to. I've told my team I only want to put out excellent content, not filler.\n\nOften, my posts are just about something that's happened to me, and that leads companies to want to do brand deals. Once a week, I bang out those brand videos. The companies send the products to my home, and I film for two to three hours.\n\nI'm constantly being sent expensive things by major brands, from mattresses to nonalcoholic drinks to vape pipes. I also buy a lot of products to try myself. Once that stuff arrives, I want it out of my house as quickly as possible.\n\nAs a result, gift-giving has become a huge part of my day. If anyone does anything nice for me, whether it's at the nail salon or anywhere else, I want to give them a gift. I feel like the universe gave the \"get stuff\" crown to the right person: I like to share the wealth.\n\nIn the evenings, I try to protect my peace and avoid getting too activated by anything. I like to find a TV series that has thousands of episodes to work through. Right now, that's The Walking Dead, which I've been watching in my nightgown. I'm in my nightgown era. I also like to take a bath before I go to sleep.\n\nI listen to my body. I'm an efficient, very organized person, but I'm also a lounger, a pyjama-wearer, and a relaxer. I chill a decent amount each day.\n\nI also listen to my body for cues on when to eat or snack. I'll make dinner reservations, but often change them because I'm not hungry enough.\n\nI couldn't care less about traditional meal times.\n\nThe other night, I went to Trader Joe's and cooked a big dinner at home for my daughter, the guy I'm seeing, and a girlfriend. In Florida, I'm more sociable than I was in New York. I'm actually seeing other human life, outside of dating or being paid.\n\nWhat I cook often depends on what's already in the fridge. I enjoy the process of taking ingredients out, laying them out on the counter, and cooking.\n\nI also feel pride that my daughter sees that, even with how busy I am with my career, I'm able to do this really normal thing for her. That's meaningful for me.",

    "fullText": "Leaving Mexico City, the place I grew up, wasn't impulsive. It was calculated — shaped by ambition and the stubborn belief that opportunity still lives somewhere else.\n\nI headed to New York City in 2020, hoping to prove myself on what I thought was the world's biggest stage. I enrolled in law school, eager to work hard and prove myself.\n\nThe city would eventually demand everything from me, relentlessly, until my life was no longer about ambition but survival.\n\nI eventually left New York City two years later, learning a lot about ambition and the true cost of the American dream.\n\nI was born and raised in Mexico City. It was the only home I'd ever known, which made leaving both harder and more necessary than I expected. Mexico City gave me everything: a vibrant social life, deep friendships, culture that felt alive in every neighborhood, and food that made you want to stay at the table for hours. My days were rich with spontaneity. My nights felt endless in the best way.\n\nGrowing up there also meant learning to coexist with things that slowly wear you down. News alerts about violence became routine. Conversations casually referenced kidnappings the way others might discuss traffic. Certain neighborhoods, roads, or situations were simply off-limits. Everyone knew it, and no one questioned it.\n\nOver time, crime made my future feel fragile. When you're born somewhere, you learn to accept these things as normal. But that doesn't mean they don't accumulate. I didn't want to build a life that depended on constantly calculating risk.\n\nAt the same time, I felt pulled toward something else entirely. The American dream may be bruised and unevenly distributed, but it still exerts a gravitational force. New York represented access to industries, ambition, and reinvention. I wanted to test myself somewhere the ceiling felt higher, even if the floor was harder.\n\nI moved to Manhattan at the end of 2020. Despite the pandemic, my experience wasn't diminished. I watched the city come back to life at full speed.\n\nNew York was exactly as advertised: expensive, intense, chaotic, and unapologetically demanding. It rewarded momentum and punished hesitation. Everything required effort: finding housing, building community, maintaining balance.\n\nAt first, I embraced the intensity. I worked constantly, studied late into the night, stayed busy, and told myself exhaustion was proof I was doing something right. But New York normalizes extremes. Long hours become the baseline. Hustle becomes identity. Rest starts to feel indulgent.\n\nWhat made New York thrilling in the short term felt unsustainable when I imagined it as permanent. The social life, the hustle culture, the constant stimulation — all of it left little room for pause.\n\nStaying long-term meant accepting a life where I had to keep my foot on the gas pedal.\n\nNew York forced me to confront my relationship with ambition, productivity, and self-worth. It taught me discipline and precision. It also clarified my limits. I learned that opportunity without sustainability eventually becomes a trap, not a privilege.\n\nI understood exactly what the city offered: access, intensity, momentum. I also understood exactly what New York and the American dream demanded in return: everything.\n\nI knew then I didn't want to build a life that required me to be \"on\" constantly. I started prioritizing myself and my core convictions, love, relationships, and sustainability. That change would eventually take me out of New York City and into another global hub: London.",

The feedback reinforced Harbaugh's reputation as a strict, no-nonsense leader who \"knows football and he loves football.\"\n\nThibodeaux expressed enthusiasm for the straightforward approach.\n\n\"I always like when you pass a certain age, you don’t have to sugarcoat what you say, you’re just kinda straightforward, white and black,\" Thibodeaux said, via the New York Post. \"You see a lot of different cultures, different people that want to sometimes change their ways for the new generation or they want to fit in or whatever the case may be.\n\n\"For me, specifically, I like old-school coaches because they just take no (expletive), black and white, you know what you’re gonna get every day. I think with a lot of young guys that we have, I think it’s gonna be good for him to really get it in order.\"\n\nThis comes after an earlier denial in January, when Thibodeaux dismissed suggestions on social media that Giants players were calling around about Harbaugh, responding to team legend Carl Banks: \"Nobody's doing this, Carl. Effort was never the problem.\"\n\nHis recent comments show he has since actively sought insights into the coach hired to turn around the franchise following seasons of inconsistency.\n\nThibodeaux, who had his fifth-year option picked up, remains optimistic about the defense under new coordinator Dennard Wilson and is relieved that position coach Charlie Bullen was retained... For now.\n\nAfter a 2025 season cut short by injury, Thibodeaux is cleared medically and eager to thrive in Harbaugh's structured environment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Kayvon Thibodeaux loves John Harbaugh's 'old-school' coaching style",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (PIX11) — A New Jersey mother is sharing her daughter’s story in hopes of changing how high-caffeine drinks are labeled across the country, and the effort is now reaching Capitol Hill.\n\n“That was the day when my life changed forever,” Jill Katz said. It’s been years since her daughter Sarah died. In 2022, the 21-year-old college student went into cardiac arrest while out with friends. Her mother says it all started with a cup of lemonade, packed with caffeine.\n“She was at a friend’s birthday party, in college, and she collapsed. She didn’t make it,” Katz said. “It’s the call that keeps parents awake at night.”\n\nSarah had a heart condition, and her family says she had always been mindful about what she ate and drank. According to her mother, she didn’t realize that 30 ounces of the drink she ordered at a popular restaurant chain contained as much as 390 milligrams of caffeine.\n\nFor context, the FDA says most healthy adults should consume no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, so the drink Sarah had was close to that limit in a single serving. “With grief, there is no restoration, but transformation,” Katz said. “Being involved with her legacy and being able to save other people’s lives in her memory.”\n\nMore: Latest News from Around the Tri-State\n\nThe restaurant chain has since removed the item from its menu following multiple lawsuits.\n\nCaffeine is widely used to boost energy by stimulating metabolism and making the heartbeat faster. Doctors, however, say high doses can be risky, especially for people with underlying conditions.\n\nAccording to the Caffeine Informer database, a single shot of espresso contains about 77 milligrams of caffeine. Energy drinks can range from 80 to 300 milligrams, depending on the brand and size. “When you stimulate so much, and the heart is not prepared for that, they can just collapse,” said cardiologist Dr. Daniel Garcia.\n\nGarcia says the lack of consistent labeling and regulation around caffeine can be dangerous for everyone, from college students to older adults. “As a cardiologist, I advise completely against any energy drink or high-content caffeine drink,” he said. “You don’t know exactly what the amount is and how your body is going to respond.”\n\nNow, Sarah’s death is drawing attention from lawmakers.\n\nNew Jersey Congressman Rob Menendez is pushing for the Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act, federal legislation that would require clearer warnings about caffeine in foods and beverages.\n\nRequire companies to clearly list caffeine content on bottles, cans, and packaging.\n\nRequire chain restaurants to disclose caffeine levels on menus.\n\nFlag items with 150 milligrams or more of caffeine with a visible “high caffeine” warning.\n\nAdd advisory language about recommended daily caffeine limits.\n\nOrder federal health agencies to study caffeine’s health effects and launch public education campaigns.\n\nSupporters say the goal is not to ban caffeinated drinks, but to make sure consumers know what they’re getting before they take a sip. “People need to know what they’re putting in their bodies,” Katz said. “We’re not talking about limiting or banning. We’re talking about making an informed choice.”\n\nThe bill has bipartisan support in Congress, with a total of 14 cosponsors, both Republicans and Democrats.",

    "fullText": "Last week, all sixteen clubs were gathered and represented for the second ever NWSL Media Day ahead of the 2026 regular season.\n\nHere are All For XI’s top moments from the 2026 NWSL Media Day:\n\nBay FC’s Jordan Silkowitz dream 2025 season\n\nA year ago, Silkowitz questioned whether she would continue playing the game at all. Today, she is Bay FC’s undisputed starter, one of the NWSL’s top-performing goalkeepers, and living out her childhood dream with the USWNT.\n\nFor more on her incredible journey, here is our latest feature.\n\nSan Diego Wave midfielder Kenza Dali isn’t sure she’ll ever quit football.\n\nHeading into her 17th professional season, the 34-year-old carries the same love for the game she felt on Day One.\n\n“You know what, it’s funny, because I’m the fittest on the team,” Dali said. “(Wave head coach Jonas Eidevall) can tell you. I look at age in terms of experience. You can’t match that. There are things in football you don’t learn on the pitch — you learn them through moments.”\n\nFull feature can be found here 🙂\n\nPortland Thorns forward Reilyn Turner just made her USWNT debut and scored her first ever goal too.\n\nShe talks to us about finding out that she had made the senior national team for the first time.\n\n“It’s a dream come true. I honestly thought it (email) was spam.”\n\nWhy Avery Patterson plays soccer\n\nUSWNT and Houston Dash defender Avery Patterson spoke about the now-stable culture she feels has been developed with the Houston Dash. The players have culture meetings with the coach every week, and speak with sports psychologists answering questions like, “Why do we play soccer?” At the end of our conversation Patterson answered exactly that question.\n\nPaige Cronin (née Monaghan) shares what being the captain and leader of Utah Royals means to her.\n\n“At first, I was scared,” said Cronin. “I’ve never done this before. For me I put a lot of pressure on myself, I try to listen to others, figure it all out. But, I think I learned through the highs and the lows.”\n\nMust Watch: Her sister’s reaction is incredible\n\nUSWNT and North Carolina Courage midfielder Riley Jackson shares her excitement to finding out she made the senior team for the first time, her sister’s hilarious reaction, and her first ever goal contribution – an assist to Trinity Rodman.\n\nRookie of the Year finalist on her storybook season\n\nAngel City FC forward Riley Tiernan talks about her special rookie season and if she’s had a chance to take in all of the wonderful success from it.\n\n“I was not expecting any of this coming out of college. It’s everything I’ve worked for. It’s something I’ve been working towards my whole life. But, to see it all fall into place and to get these small and big accomplishments has been really special.”\n\n“I would say I’m still digesting, the fact that I’m living in the best place in the world, doing what I love to do for a job.”\n\nEmeri Adames is very serious about her national holiday idea\n\nSeattle Reign forward Emeri Adames reveals her idea for a national holiday, and you better like it!\n\n“I would do National Pickle Day because I love pickles so much. I think everyone should like pickles. And when they say they don’t like pickles, it makes me mad.”\n\nSan Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley reveals while at Target, she found out that she had made the USWNT.\n\n“It was really exciting. I had gotten an email but I don’t check it as frequently as I should. So I was a little bit late, but I saw it when I was with my mom at Target. We were both through the roof, very surprised, very full of excitement and gratitude.”\n\n2025 NWSL Midfielder of the Year\n\nNorth Carolina Courage star Manaka Matsukubo shares what it means to be honored with that award and gives plenty of love to her teammates and family.\n\n“I am honored. However, it’s not just me, it’s my teammates.”\n\nWashington Spirit and USWNT forward, and California native Trinity Rodman talks her excitement about playing at home for the 2028 LA Olympics.\n\n“It always is like this full-circle moment because I grew up here and I started playing soccer down here.”\n\n“I’m so excited. I’m going to have a lot of people, so I better start getting tickets ready for it.”\n\nJordyn Bloomer stole the show in the NWSL in 2025 and will be a player to look out for this season as well.\n\nHowever, her journey has been filled with adversity, patience, and so much more, but she has gotten past all of it. Now, she is shining brighter than ever.\n\nThe goalkeeper discussed her unique journey with us.\n\nCalifornia native Onyeka Gamero shares what it means to be coming back to her home state and join the NWSL.\n\n“I remember saying, ‘I want to be back in the U.S., I’ll go anywhere.’ But of course being in California – my parents right there, everything is so familiar.”\n\n“It just feels nice. I feel good. For me as a player, I feel like that’s where it starts, just feeling ok.”\n\nWashington Spirit star midfielder Croix Bethune shares some of the key details from her conversation with USWNT head coach Emma Hayes.\n\nCasey Murphy made a big move to the Boston Legacy joining as a free agent goalkeeper. One of the reasons she gave at NWSL media day was the titles. Boston is a city that notoriously cares deeply about their sports. Mistakes can linger in the minds of players and fans with the pressure, here’s what Murphy had to say on the matter.\n\nDid Utah Royals forward Mina Tanaka come up with the greatest holiday ever?",

    "fullText": "At first glance, the New York Mets’ recent trade for center fielder Luis Robert Jr. was made to fill a specific hole. The Mets need a good defensive outfielder to hold the fort while prospect Carson Benge finishes developing, and Robert fits the bill.\n\nBeyond that, many consider Robert a broken player who can’t be fixed, but the Mets don’t really share that perspective. David Adler of MLB.com tried to get beneath the obvious reasons for the trade to see why the Mets have a different opinion, and he came up with three numbers that could explain the team’s logic.\n\nThe first is bat speed. According to Adler Robert ranked in the top ten percent of all players at 75.6 mph. It’s an impressive stat, but the logic here is a little sketchy. Robert’s offensive numbers have been terrible for several seasons now, so just because the former Chicago White Sox outfielder has bat speed doesn’t mean he can actually put it in play and be productive again.\n\nThe second number Adler used is the obvious one: Robert’s outs above average number was +7, and that’s why they traded for him. Mets GM David Stearn made it abundantly clear that run prevention would be a priority this season, and Robert fits the bill and then some. That particular stat reflects his strong range, which Robert will definitely need in an outfield where he’ll be playing alongside right fielder Juan Soto and a player to be named later in left\n\nThe third number is about Robert’s speed, which really hasn’t been discussed much. His sprint speed is 29.0 feet per second, according to Adler, and that puts him in the upper tier of all MLB runners. Indeed, it’s almost elite, so if Robert can hit even a little bit, he could match or exceed the 33 stolen bases he posted last year, which was a career high for him.\n\nSome of the potential associated with these numbers is obviously speculative, but the good news is that (a) they didn’t give up much to get him, and (b) contract wise, this is a low-risk deal. Robert is playing for $20 million this year, which is pricey for what he’s done offensively, but Stearns has been emphasizing short-term deals in his acquisition this offseason, so if Robert disappoint as a hitter, the Mets can simply benefit from his defense, then move on from him at the end of the season.",

Goldschmidt, 38, returns to the Yankees after hitting .274/.328/.403 for them last season.\n\n— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) February 6, 2026\n\nGoldschmidt’s 2025 season with the Yankees marked his first year in the American League after six seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals and eight with the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nSigned to a one-year, $12.5 million contract, the veteran first baseman appeared in 146 games, recording 489 at-bats. He batted .274 with 76 runs scored, 134 hits (including 31 doubles and 10 home runs), 45 RBIs, and 5 stolen bases. His on-base percentage stood at .328, slugging .403, for an OPS of .731 and a 103 wRC+ (slightly above league average).\n\nGoldschmidt showed early-season promise with a strong start in the first two months, posting higher production before settling into a more modest output overall. His power numbers dipped to a career-low 10 home runs in a full season, though he maintained solid contact and contributed defensively at first base.\n\nA memorable moment came during a series against his former Cardinals team in August, where he received a warm reception in St. Louis and delivered three hits in a Yankees victory that helped secure a sweep.\n\nCareer-wise, Goldschmidt remains one of the game’s most accomplished first basemen. Through the end of 2025, he has played 15 MLB seasons (debuting in 2011), amassing 2,190 hits, 372 home runs, 1,232 RBIs, 1,280 runs, and 174 stolen bases across 7,608 at-bats. His career batting line reads .288/.378/.504 with an .882 OPS and 63.8 WAR.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Paul Goldschmidt and the Yankees are working toward a one-year contract, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press, another move by New York that makes its 2026 roster resemble last year's team.\n\nThe person spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because the agreement was subject to a successful physical. The deal likely would be for $5 million or less, the person said.\n\nA seven-time All-Star and the 2022 NL MVP, the 38-year-old Goldschmidt hit .274 with 10 homers, 45 RBIs and a .731 OPS after signing a $12.5 million, one-year contract as a free agent.\n\nHe tailed off badly, hitting .287 with eight homers, 36 RBIs and a .776 OPS before the All-Star break and .245 with two homers, nine RBIs and a .631 OPS after. The right-handed-hitting Goldschmidt lost playing time at first to lefty-batting Ben Rice and started just two postseason games.\n\nA seven-time Gold Glove winner, Goldschmidt provides defense and a veteran presence to a team seeking its first World Series title since 2009. He has a .288 average with 372 homers, 1,232 RBIs and an ,882 OPS in 15 major league seasons with Arizona (2011-18), St. Louis (2019) and the Yankees.\n\nComing off an AL Division Series loss to Toronto, New York has had a relatively quiet offseason. The Yankees' major moves were re-signing outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger to a $162.5 million, five-year contract,acquiring left-hander Ryan Weathers from Miami in a trade and retaining center fielder Trent Grisham with a $22,025,000 qualifying offer.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

    "title": "Floyd Mayweather accused in lawsuits of owing millions for luxury watches, gold, and rent on palatial apartment",
    "description": "The boxer allegedly failed to pay the $100,000-a-month rent on a swanky 4,629-square-foot duplex condo in Manhattan.",
    "fullText": "Former boxing champ Floyd Mayweather Jr. has been hit with three new lawsuits alleging that he failed to pay millions to two jewelry stores and owes hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent on a palatial luxury Manhattan apartment.\n\nMayweather rented the 4,629-square-foot duplex unit on the 18th and 19th floors of the Baccarat Hotel and Residences, a high-end condo tower in Midtown, in late 2024. The lease signing was reported in several outlets, including the New York Post and Architectural Digest.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in January in state court alleges that he fell behind on the $100,000-a-month rent for five months and agreed to pay up, then only gave them a portion of what was owed.\n\nThe apartment is owned by Leila and David Centner, a Miami couple who are wellness and tech entrepreneurs. The Centners purchased two condos at The Baccarat in 2016 for $15.3 million and combined them into the two-level unit later rented by Mayweather.\n\nLeila Centner told Business Insider that Mayweather initially paid the rent, then stopped in July 2025. She said she spoke to him in December about missed payments and that he appeared unaware he owed $500,000 in back rent.\n\n\"He was surprised,\" she said. \"He had no idea he was that far behind.\"\n\nMayweather made one $100,000 payment, but didn't settle the remaining balance, and didn't respond to her further efforts to reach him, Centner said.\n\n\"He did say he'd pay, and then he disappeared. We don't know why,\" Centner said.\n\nThe suit seeks $337,736.13. The sum represents the $500,000 in arrears plus late fees, minus a deposit Mayweather paid at the start of the lease and the $100,000 catch-up payment.\n\nAn attorney for Mayweather did not provide a comment by deadline. He has not responded to the lawsuit in court.\n\nIn a separate legal matter, a Miami jeweler sued Mayweather last month, alleging the boxer owes more than a million dollars for jewelry he took but never paid for.\n\nAJ's Jewelry said in a complaint filed in state court that Mayweather, described as a longtime customer, made two trips to the store in August and left with 26 Cartier, Patek Philippe, Rolex, and Audemars Piguet watches, and 15 gold chains. The suit claims that Mayweather agreed to pay the $1.675 million bill later.\n\n\"Because of the parties' long-standing relationship and prior transactions, AJ's Jewelry reasonably believed and relied upon Mayweather's promises to pay for the jewelry items that he took possession of in full,\" the complaint says.\n\n\"To date, Mayweather has only paid AJ's Jewelry $300,000 of the outstanding balance.\"\n\nThe store alleged that five checks from Mayweather between August and November bounced.\n\n\"AJ's Jewelry has repeatedly contacted Mayweather both orally and in writing, to request payment of the remaining balance for the Jewelry. Each time, Mayweather acknowledges the debt owed and promises to pay for the Jewelry, then never sends the monies owed,\" the complaint said.\n\nMayweather's attorney has not responded to the filing in court and did not offer a comment by deadline.\n\nMayweather is also facing legal action from another Miami jeweler. Leonard Sulaymanov sued him and associate Jona Rechnitz in federal court last month, accusing them of failing to honor the terms of a settlement they had reached last year over $3.9 million in watches and jewelry that Mayweather had been accused of taking and failing to pay for.\n\nMayweather's attorney did not provide a comment on that suit. Rechnitz — who is awaiting resentencing in a federal corruption case — did not respond.\n\nThe 48-year-old boxer racked up over a billion dollars in winnings over his undefeated career and has pivoted to business ventures, including real estate investment, since his 2017 retirement.\n\nIn December, Business Insider reported that Mayweather had taken out millions in mortgages on his homes in 2024 and 2025 and faced a string of lawsuits and liens. Two of Mayweather's commercial properties have been foreclosed, and he is at risk of losing a Las Vegas building that houses his strip club over $52,000 in back property taxes and penalties.\n\nIn response to Business Insider's story in December, Mayweather's lawyer, Bobby Samini, said the athlete is not \"experiencing financial strain.\"\n\n\"Floyd Mayweather rose from poverty and hardship to become one of the greatest champions in boxing history, transforming his talent and discipline into an undefeated legacy and a highly successful business empire,\" Samini said in a statement at the time. \"Creating unfounded narratives misrepresents the truth and minimizes the achievements of an individual who has risen from adversity to become one of the most successful athletes and entrepreneurs of his generation.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Mayweather filed a lawsuit against Showtime Networks, which broadcast some of his biggest fights, and former executive Stephen Espinoza, seeking more than $340 million for \"misappropriated funds\" from decade-old bouts.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Showtime and Mayweather's former manager, Al Haymon, diverted winnings from the boxer in what it called a \"long-running and elaborate scheme of financial fraud.\"\n\nHaymon, described as a \"father figure\" to Mayweather in the complaint, is not named as a defendant in the suit. He could not be reached for comment, and a close associate did not return calls.\n\n\"These baseless claims lack legal or factual merit. We strongly reject them and will respond accordingly through the court process,\" a spokesperson for Showtime parent Paramount wrote in a statement to Business Insider. Espinoza declined to comment.\n\nNote: Floyd Mayweather filed a defamation lawsuit against Business Insider in connection with a previous story about Mayweather's real estate investments. The case is pending, and BI stands by its reporting.",

    "description": "Luigi Mangione left court shouting \"double jeopardy\" after a Manhattan judge set a trial date that edges ahead of his federal trial date.",
    "fullText": "A state court judge in New York set a July 8 trial date in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Friday, ending a nearly yearlong battle over who — federal or state prosecutors — will be first to try the accused killer, Luigi Mangione.\n\nThe short, contentious hearing ended with Mangione shouting to a courtroom audience of press and admirers about \"double jeopardy\" as he was led back to jail.\n\n\"It's the same trial twice,\" he said as he was escorted out of the courtroom in a jail uniform and handcuffs. \"One plus one equals two. Double jeopardy by any common sense definition.\"\n\nThe decision was a loss for his defense lawyers, who had urged that Mangione's state murder trial be held some time after his federal fatal stalking trial. That federal trial will now go second, with jury selection set for September 8 and opening statements for October 13.\n\n\"The defense will not be ready on July 8,\" defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo told the judge, during the hearing's most heated moment.\n\n\"Be ready!\" New York Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro answered angrily.\n\nFriedman Agnifilo told the judge that her team, which includes her husband, Marc Agnifilo, has been extremely busy winning victories for their client. In September, she said, the team convinced Carro to drop the top charge in the state indictment, murder as an act of terrorism. Last week, she said, Mangione's federal judge tossed that indictment's top two counts, removing the risk of the death penalty.\n\nBut as she started to tell Carro, \"we haven't been twiddling our thumbs,\" the judge cut her off.\n\n\"Great,\" he interrupted, his voice impatient. \"You've done a great job. So be ready on July 8.\"\n\nWho gets to try Mangione first — New York or the feds — was a thorny question that was fought over for nearly a year in neighboring courthouses in lower Manhattan. And it's a battle that's all about double jeopardy.\n\nMangione's defense lawyers accuse lead state prosecutor Joel Seidemann of pushing to go first, before the feds, because going second would violate New York case law against double jeopardy — the state's restriction on trying someone twice for the same crime.\n\nSeidemann \"does not want his case to be double-jeopardied out because he did all that work,\" Friedman Agnifilo told the judge in court.\n\nSeidemann snapped back that the defense is seeking to deprive the state of New York from prosecuting \"a murder that happened in Midtown Manhattan, on our streets, to a guest in our city.\"\n\n\"All I can say is double jeopardy is something that was meant to protect people and they're using it as a weapon,\" Agnifilo Friedman said as she left the courthouse.\n\n\"This is a tug of war between two prosecutorial offices,\" she added — suggesting that the war, lost moments earlier by Mangione, may not be over.\n\nMangione, who is charged in both indictments with fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The father of two from Minnesota was ambushed from behind as he entered a Midtown Manhattan hotel to deliver remarks at an annual investor conference.\n\nMangione has been held without bail since his arrest on December 9, 2024 following a five-day manhunt.\n\nHe remains at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where last week a man was arrested on charges that he had impersonated an FBI agent in a botched effort to free an inmate — Mangione, according to a law enforcement source",

    "title": "I used ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity to research a gnarly NYC rent situation. Here's what I learned.",
    "description": "AI tools can help interpret complex documents and help people understand their rights. You still have to check in with a human expert, though.",
    "fullText": "In New York City, three things are certain: death, taxes, and sky-high rent.\n\nThere may not be much AI can do for death. Taxes, I'm not sure. But it turns out this technology can be surprisingly helpful if you have a unique rent situation.\n\nI live in a former superintendent-occupied apartment in a prewar co-op in Manhattan. Although I signed a market-rate lease when I moved in, I later learned — with the help of AI tools — that my apartment might qualify as a \"rent-stabilized\" unit.\n\nNew York is one of a handful of cities where rent increases can be limited by law, depending on the circumstances. This is known as rent stabilization. It's a milder form of rent regulation that lets landlords charge more, but not too much more.\n\nMy apartment's rent history showed the unit had been registered as rent-stabilized in the 1980s and contained no obvious record of a deregulation event. Did that mean the apartment might still be regulated? Could I gain protection from potentially large rent increases in the future?\n\nI couldn't find clear answers on Reddit or Google, so I uploaded a photo of the apartment's rent-registration history and asked ChatGPT to help me interpret it.\n\nChatGPT walked me through the document and said this type of situation is routinely evaluated by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which oversees rent-stabilization and related rules in NYC.\n\nI told ChatGPT to show me its sources. It cited relevant provisions of the rent-stabilization code and several court decisions. AI can sometimes hallucinate, so I asked Perplexity and Google Gemini the same questions, as an initial way to double-check the facts. These AI tools reached similar high-level conclusions but differed in their reasoning and the way they cited authoritative sources. Gemini and Perplexity were better at showing their work than ChatGPT, and Gemini tended to be the most conservative in its framing, which made me trust it more.\n\nI still caught all three bots making mistakes. In one instance, Gemini cited a legal case that didn't exist. When I called it out, it quickly corrected itself. I repeated this process multiple times, reading the underlying legal provisions and pushing back on AI-powered conclusions I thought were wrong. I even role-played as a landlord, presenting arguments rental property owners might make about why my apartment is not rent-stabilized.\n\nEventually, I hit a wall. No matter how much I challenged the bots, they were confident that my situation raised legitimate questions that New York's DHCR might resolve. That's when I called a housing attorney — which cost $35 through the New York Bar Association's referral service — to sanity-check everything. After reviewing the documents, he agreed that filing a rent-overcharge complaint was reasonable. So I went ahead. The proceeding is ongoing, and no determination has been made yet.\n\nMy case is pretty unusual. But there are broader takeaways:\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer last month that he was finally prepared to drop his freeze on billions of dollars in funding for a major New York infrastructure project.\n\nBut there was a condition: In exchange for the money, Schumer had to agree to rename New York’s Penn Station and Washington’s Dulles International Airport after Trump.\n\nThe startling offer, which was described by two people familiar with the conversation, was swiftly rejected by Schumer, who told the president he didn’t have the power to deliver on such an unorthodox request.\n\nIn the weeks since, Trump has continued to withhold the more than $16 billion earmarked for the long-planned Gateway project connecting New York and New Jersey through a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River.\n\nThe two states are now suing the Trump administration over the freeze, alleging in a complaint filed earlier this week that the funding suspension is unlawful.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe episode, first reported by Punchbowl, offers a fresh window into Trump’s ever-expanding effort to secure an outsized place in American history — and to do so in part by branding nearly everything around him with his own name.\n\nSince returning to the White House, the president has introduced a slew of initiatives bearing the Trump name, including the Trump Gold Card offering a high-priced path to citizenship, the TrumpRx website offering lower-priced prescription drugs, and a new Trump-class battleship meant to solidify his era of “peace through strength” foreign policy for years to come.\n\nTrump in recent months has set his sights on even bigger targets: Adding his name first to the US Institute of Peace and then, even more controversially, to Washington’s iconic Kennedy Center.\n\nStill, Trump’s offer to Schumer would have represented perhaps his most audacious move yet, an apparent attempt to leverage the future of a massive infrastructure project to fulfill his own personal wishes.\n\nThe commission in charge of the Gateway tunnel has warned that it will soon have to shut down work on the project and lay off roughly 1,000 workers if the Trump administration does not release the funding it needs.\n\nThe tunnel’s construction predates Trump’s return to office, with the federal government on the hook for a significant portion of the funding needed to complete it. But Trump moved to halt the project late last year, a decision that Democratic officials in New Jersey and New York have argued was politically motivated.\n\nSchumer has since played a central role in trying to negotiate the unfreezing of the funding. Yet despite that priority, there’s little that the Democrat could conceivably do on his own to put Trump’s name on either Penn Station or Dulles Airport.\n\nWhile some conservative lawmakers have already introduced legislation to rename Dulles as the “Donald J. Trump International Airport,” it’s so far gained little traction.\n\nThe legislation has not advanced in the GOP-controlled Congress, and as a result remains unlikely to pass.",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets officially ended the soul searching portion of their offseason today, announcing the hire of Frank Reich as their new offensive coordinator.\n\nIn a move that feels both like a safe veteran play and a massive gamble, Head Coach Aaron Glenn has effectively handed Reich the keys to the kingdom. Glenn made it clear during the search that he wanted a head coach of the offense someone who could operate with total autonomy while Glenn refocuses on calling the defensive plays.\n\nBut for Jets fans, the question isn’t about Reich’s resume. It’s about which version of the man is stepping off the plane at Newark.\n\nTo understand the anxiety at One Jets Drive, you have to look at the two polar opposite outcomes of Reich’s recent career.\n\nThe Quarterback Whisperer (2017-2020) This is the Reich the Jets are praying for. This is the architect who helped Doug Pederson guide Nick Foles to a Super Bowl ring. This is the man who took a washed Philip Rivers in 2020 and squeezed out an 11-5 playoff season. This version of Reich is Multiple in the best way he adapts his scheme to his players, uses RPOs to protect his QB, and leans on a physical run game to set up deep shots.\n\nThe Scheme Rigid Veteran (2022-2023) This is the Reich who was fired mid season in back to back years. In Carolina, he was criticized for trying to force Bryce Young into a static pocket system that didn’t fit the rookie’s traits. The offense became predictable, horizontal, and frankly boring. This version of Reich prioritizes the system over the personnel, resulting in an offense that ranks in the bottom five of every meaningful category.\n\nIf Reich returns to his roots, the biggest winners are Breece Hall(If we bring him back. Please come back!) and Garrett Wilson.\n\nThe Run Game: Reich’s best years in Indy featured a dominant Jonathan Taylor. With Breece Hall, Reich has a weapon that can execute the Wide Zone scheme that defines his best work.\n\nThe X Factor: Garrett Wilson is the perfect rhythm receiver for Reich’s West Coast hybrid. If Reich can get back to the Triangle Reads and Mesh concepts that made the 2017 Eagles so dangerous, Wilson could see a career high in targets.",

    "description": "A single mom juggling multiple jobs, grad school, and rising costs explains what it takes to stay in New York City — and why she may have to leave.",
    "fullText": "Massiel Lugo hit the New York lottery — and it's why she can afford to stay in the city she grew up in.\n\nThe 33-year-old single mother of two took over her aunt's lease in Jackson Heights, Queens, when her second child was born. Moving into the two-bedroom was only possible because her aunt, also a single mother, left the city for a more affordable life in Georgia.\n\n\"I remember watching her struggle a lot, and then she could no longer do it on her own, and she just got up and left,\" Lugo said.\n\nWhile Lugo's apartment isn't rent-stabilized, she inherited a six-year-old lease, and her landlord has held off on raising her rent to market rate, which is around $2,900 for the typical two-bedroom in the area. Still, the Queens native wonders if she should follow in her aunt's footsteps and leave the city.\n\nWhen her son's father moved out about five years ago, Lugo sublet her second bedroom and skipped meals to make ends meet. These days, she manages to pay her $1,700 rent by juggling multiple jobs while going to school. It helps that her 16-year-old daughter, Jalene, has taken paid internships, and her parents, who live four blocks away, help care for her eight-year-old son, Ozzie, who has autism.\n\nBut the city that's always been home is feeling increasingly hostile. A growing share of New Yorkers are struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world as the costs of basic necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that's driven up rents and home prices. Family-sized apartments with two or three bedrooms are especially hard to come by. The cost crisis is pushing many out of the city, particularly families with young children and lower-income Black and Hispanic residents.\n\nNew York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, got elected on a pledge to bring these costs down. In January, he and Gov. Kathy Hochul rolled out their plan to significantly expand free and low-cost childcare for young children. Lugo was invited by the mayor's team to an event celebrating the announcement. While she supports the efforts, her kids are too old to benefit from them. Lugo and her family could see cost savings through other mayoral proposals, including free buses, city-owned grocery stores, and more affordable housing.\n\nLugo is among the more than 40% of the city's renters who spend more than a third of their gross income on housing. Her traditionally working-class immigrant neighborhood is under pressure from gentrification and the rising cost of living. At the same time, the streets and subways don't feel as safe as they did when Lugo was growing up.\n\n\"It's a love-hate relationship with New York,\" she said. \"At the end of the day, it's home, but it has changed so much.\"\n\nFor the last several years, Lugo worked both as a teacher's assistant in a public school and as a therapist for children with autism while earning her bachelor's degree. In January, she started a master's program to become a certified therapist for autistic children.\n\nOver the last few years, she's pieced together between $50,000 and $60,000 in income from her jobs and monthly child support. However, she's working less this semester to make more time for graduate school, which costs her $1,300 per semester. Eventually, she hopes to make upwards of $80,000 as a full-time certified therapist.\n\nIn the meantime, her income is barely enough to cover her family's expenses. Transportation and grocery costs have ballooned. Food costs in New York City rose by about 68% between 2013 and 2023 — much more than the national average of 49%, the state comptroller found. Lugo is an ALICE, which stands for asset-limited, income-constrained, employed, and describes someone who makes too much to qualify for most assistance, but still struggles to get by. She no longer gets food stamps, and her grocery bills have ballooned as her kids have gotten older.\n\n\"I buy food, and it's just gone,\" she said. \"I never thought I would yell at my kids, like, 'Did you guys really just finish all the juice boxes in a day?'\"\n\nDespite living a block from the 7 subway train and multiple bus lines, Lugo said she's increasingly found herself taking Ubers, in part because Ozzie is sensitive to the noise on public transit. It helps that Jalene rides transit for free because she's a public school student, and Ozzie takes a city-provided school bus because of his diagnosis.\n\nShe's also racked up about $7,000 in credit card debt by treating her kids to occasional meals out and new clothes. She was late on her rent payment last month after putting more money toward paying down her credit card.\n\n\"I used to be really good at saving, but my mindset has changed a lot. I'm just like, what am I saving up for?\" she said. \"I want to travel, I want to make memories with my kids, and that's become more of a priority for me.\"\n\nWhen Lugo's parents first moved to Queens from the Dominican Republic about 45 years ago, life was affordable for them, Lugo said. Some of her aunts and uncles were even able to buy co-ops in the area.\n\nBut the neighborhood has gentrified. Lugo remembers when the first Starbucks opened up in Jackson Heights in 2008 — it felt like a turning point. A few years ago, her father closed the bodega he owned for decades when the building was sold to a developer. The neighborhood has felt less safe in recent years, she said, with a rise in illegal brothels and disorder on the streets.\n\nLugo isn't ready to leave the city, but she'd like to raise her kids in a quieter neighborhood. She dreams of moving to Bayside, a wealthier, more suburban part of Queens, but rent and transportation costs out there would be even higher. She thinks that finding any other apartment similar in price and size to her own would be nearly impossible in the city.\n\nJalene has her sights set on Yale and wants to eventually become a lawyer. Lugo has told her she can only move away for college if she gets a full ride.\n\n\"I tell her, 'I want you to live your life. I want you to be a child, but you need to work extremely hard, because a studio is $2,000 right now. I can only imagine how much your generation is going to have to pay in the future,'\" Lugo said.",

    "description": "Among other things, Hofstra wrestler Will Conlon also likes to read and lists “Catcher in the Rye” as his favorite book.  Conlon doesn’t compare himself to the 16-year-old main character, created in the 1951 classic novel by J.D.

    "fullText": "Among other things, Hofstra wrestler Will Conlon also likes to read and lists “Catcher in the Rye” as his favorite book.\n\n“I read that for my 12th-grade AP literature class,” said the 197-pound redshirt college sophomore from Hoover, Ala.\n\nConlon doesn’t compare himself to the 16-year-old main character, created in the 1951 classic novel by J.D. Salinger, who dealt with the reality of adulthood in a much grimier era in New York City.\n\nAnd of course, Hofstra is located 30 miles from the City on Long Island, where wrestlers can find a beach on the Atlantic Ocean as fast as they can find a much busier life in New York City.\n\n“It’s actually more of a suburban area and what I’m used to,” said Conlon, who grew up outside of Birmingham, and does find time to enjoy today’s New York City. “My coach probably doesn’t want me to say this, but there are times I go to the City to eat and eat too much.”\n\nBut Conlon, a 2023 Alabama state high school champion, does believe “100 percent” that the book’s message is helping him adapt to NCAA Division I wrestling.\n\n“(The book) had a big impact on me,” he said. “I’m due to go back through that book because there are many lessons to have been learned from it.”\n\nConlon simply calls his college wrestling career “challenging.” That included a true freshman season in 2023-24 when he went 9-15 at 184 pounds and a redshirt year last season that saw him beat two eventual national qualifiers before undergoing surgery in March to repair an ACL injury.\n\nHe returned this season much healthier and has compiled a 14-9 record through Feb. 1. Though he is not ranked, Conlon considers himself and other Hofstra teammates — like fellow redshirt sophomore Jake Slotnick, 16-11 at 165 pounds — as diamonds in the rough.\n\n“In high school and middle school when I started wrestling, I’ve felt like I’ve been looked over at times,” said Conlon, who also won an NHSCA national championship before coming to Hofstra.\n\n“For me, it’s about chipping away against the top guys in my weight class and trying to close the gap. Consistency is what’s going to get me there. The biggest aspect of my training since high school is where I’ve made myself consistent with training and doing what it takes to get better.\n\n“I’m really thankful for the coaching staff that I have now and who took a chance on me.”\n\nHofstra coach Jamie Franco, the former Pride alum who was a three-time NCAA qualifier (2012-14), believes Hofstra can return to the days when the EIWA school finished as high as seventh in the nation in 2007, but has not had an All-American since 2018 when heavyweight Michael Hughes finished sixth.\n\n“We are a young team,” said Franco, now in his second year. “We just need some experience. Fortunately, most of this team has one or two years of eligibility left.”\n\nFranco — who was introduced to the Alabama native from Conlon’s club coach, Shad Rissler, also a New York native and former prep teammate of Franco —believes that Conlon can be one of his team’s leaders.\n\n“I think he’s a better version of himself and we see each week he’s getting a little stronger,” said Franco. “We hope over the next month before the conference tournament that he keeps building and realizes how well he is doing.”\n\nWill, the son of Carol and Joshua (a former high school wrestler) Conlon, has tried to share his challenge with friends and family back home in Alabama.\n\n“I tell them what’s going on, but if I wasn’t myself, I don’t think I’d truly understand what this has been all about,” he admitted. “It’s a different beast. You have to wake up early, go to workouts and team practices and classes and then go through the competition aspect of it. Every time you compete, a guy is looking to rip your head off, and you have to be willing to do the same thing.”\n\nConlon also credits the Hofstra brotherhood in helping me adapt to his college environment and wrestling goals.\n\n“I just moved off campus this past semester into a house with six other guys and teammates. I consider all those guys my brothers,” he said. “That’s what was important for me when I came here on my visit. I felt like I was home with my family. The summer before my freshman year, I came into training with a team and felt connected with that group.”\n\nBut Conlon also believes he must take his own responsibility to reach his wrestling goals.\n\n“There is something I learned since being in college: you have to seek out the answers to what your development is going to look like and how you are going to get to the next level,” he said. “At this level, you can’t just come in and work on your two best shots of two best re-attacks, work on top and bottom and simply achieve what you want to achieve.\n\n“I feel like you have to be a fan of the sport and be watching the guys who are constantly innovating in the sport and adopting some of those habits and training methods of the best wrestlers. I think some guys don’t realize they also have to be innovators and be as much of a spectator as a competitor.”\n\nA management major, who has been on Hofstra’s Dean List in the past two years, does believe he is reaching his overall life’s goals the past three years.\n\n“Before wrestling was in the cards, which happened late in my high school career, I was thinking about going to a state school near me like Auburn or Alabama,” he said. “And while that experience might have been good, I think taking a different step and direction to wrestle in college and in a completely unknown area, it’s definitely something that aligns with my goals, which is trying out next experiences that make up my life.”",

    "fullText": "Knicks cut ties with Jalen Brunson's struggling 6-foot-7 teammate via trade to Bulls originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlthough the Golden State Warriors’ trade for Kristaps Porzingis and the Washington Wizards’ trade for Anthony Davis (both completed on Wednesday night) will be the main topic of discussion heading into the final stretch of the trade season, it’s worth noting that the New York Knicks recently executed a deal of their own.\n\nThe 2024 Eastern Conference participants cut ties with Jalen Brunson's struggling 6-foot-7 forward via a trade to the Chicago Bulls after less than a full season.\n\n“The New York Knicks are trading Guerschon Yabusele to the Chicago Bulls for Dalen Terry,” ESPN’s Shams Charania reported early Thursday morning.\n\nYabusele has been one of the Knicks’ most disappointing contributors this season, regardless of position. Following an inspiring 2024-25 campaign with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2024-25 (he averaged 11.0 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, while shooting 50.1% from the field and 38.0% from deep), the Knicks felt comfortable taking a chance on him in free agency.\n\nIt’s clear now that New York’s decision backfired, as the former first-round pick was virtually unplayable for first-year head coach Mike Brown this year. Yabusele contributed only 2.7 points and 2.1 rebounds per game with the Knicks, connecting on 39.3% of his field goals and 29.4% from three-point land.\n\nTerry isn’t a high-level bench contributor, either, but it’s challenging to envision him being worse than Yabusele in New York.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors cut ties with Stephen Curry's 6-foot-9 fan-favorite teammate via trade to Raptors",

    "description": "Artemi Panarin’s run on Broadway is over. After seven memorable seasons with the New York Rangers, Panarin’s off to Hollywood",
    "fullText": "Artemi Panarin’s run on Broadway is over. After seven memorable seasons with the New York Rangers, Panarin’s off to Hollywood following a trade to the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nPanarin had 607 points (205 goals, 402 assists) in 482 regular-season games over seven seasons with the Rangers, and his 1.26 points-per-game average is best in franchise history. He ranks eighth all-time for the Rangers in assists, ninth in points, and 14th in goals.\n\nHe left behind a treasure trove of memorable highlights in New York, and will be remembered as one of the most exciting players ever to wear the Blueshirts sweater.\n\nLet’s break down the 10 greatest moments for Panarin during his tenure with the Rangers.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin and former Blue Jackets teammate Sergei Bobrovsky are dear friends, but the Breadman made his countryman — and star defenseman Aaron Ekblad — look silly when he dangled around both and snuck a back-hand shot past the Florida Panthers goalie for a highlight-reel goal in the first period in Sunrise, Florida.\n\nWhy it was great: Before arriving in New York, Panarin owned the Rangers, with 12 goals and 18 points in 12 career games. So it was a relief to see Panarin register his first three-goal game in a Blueshirts sweater in Game 31 of his first season. Panarin had an assist on Mika Zibanejad‘s power-play goal that tied the game, then sealed the hat trick with a pair of goals late in the third period of the Rangers’ 6-3 win over the San Jose Sharks.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin scored a career-high four goals against the Carolina Hurricanes, helping the Rangers turn a 2-1 second-period deficit into a 6-2 laugher. He also had an assist to record points on five of New York’s six goals.\n\nWhy it was great: Maybe the last memorable moment for Panarin in a Rangers sweater. With New York up 1-0 late in the first period, Panarin floated a seeing-eye shot past Bobrovsky in the outdoor contest played in Miami. It ended up being the game-winning goal, and Panarin also added an assist in the Rangers’ 5-1 win over the Panthers.\n\nWhy it was great: It’s easy to forget how far the Rangers had fallen and how quickly that drop off was after so much success for most of the 2010s. But the Letter 1.0, authored in February 2018 by then-GM Jeff Gorton and team president Glen Sather, ushered in a rebuild that climaxed earlier than expected when Panarin signed a mammoth seven-year, $81.5 million contract. The Rangers outbid the Islanders and Blues Jackets for his services, and Panarin was worth every penny. He led the Rangers in scoring six straight seasons before traded to the Kings, and the Blueshirts reached the Eastern Conference Final in 2022 and 2024, and won the Presidents’ Trophy in 2023-24 with Panarin a vital member of their core.\n\nWhen: Oct. 12, 2023-Nov. 18, 2023\n\nWhy it was great: The 2023-24 season was undoubtedly Panarin’s best ever, and he started it with a bang by setting the Rangers record for longest season-opening point streak. Panarin had 10 goals and 16 assists, and the Rangers were 12-2-1 in that stretch. That streak set New York on the path toward its Metropolitan Division championship and the franchise’s fourth Presidents’ Trophy. It also started Panarin on the way to 120 points, second most in Rangers history.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin often showed off his Rockettes-style leg kick after big goals, but it all started with this highlight-reel tally against the Detroit Red Wings early in 2020. Panarin dangled around Detroit defenseman Alex Biega then snuck a back-hand shot past Jimmy Howard to put the Rangers up 3-0. He sealed the goal with a kick, which became his signature celebration.\n\nWhy it was great: Playing outside at MetLife Stadium in front of a pro-Rangers crowd crowd of roughly 80,000, the Blueshirts fell behind 4-1 in the second period then trailed 5-3 in the late stages of the third period against the rival Islanders. Yet, Chris Kreider deflected Panarin’s point shot on the power play past Ilya Sorokin to make it 5-4. After Zibanejad tied it with another power-play tally, Panarin sent the Rangers fans into delirium by stealing Noah Dobson’s pass on the opening shift of overtime and beating Sorokin for an emotional 6-5 comeback win, though only after video review upheld his OT winner.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin scored the game-winning goal in Game 1 of the Rangers’ second-round playoff series against the Hurricanes, then had three assists in a 4-3 win in Game 2. But the Rangers coughed up a late 2-1 lead in Game 3 on the road when Andrei Svechnikov tied the score with the net empty at the other end. But Panarin’s hard work paid off early in OT, when he got inside position on Carolina’s Jalen Chatfield and redirected Vincent Trocheck‘s pass by Pyotr Kochetkov for the game-winning goal at 1:43 of the extra session, giving the Rangers a commanding 3-0 lead in the series. The Rangers ultimately claimed the series in six games.\n\nWhy it was great: It had been five years since the Rangers won a series in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and they looked destined for another early exit after losing a three-overtime classic in Game 1 and fell behind 3-1 to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the best-of-7 first round — especially after they allowed seven goals apiece in Games 3 and 4. But after the Rangers won Games 5 and 6, sending the series to MSG for Game 7, Panarin authored his signature Rangers moment, fittingly on the power play in overtime of the do-or-die game. He dusted off a pass from Adam Fox twice then wristed the game-winner through traffic and past Tristan Jarry, sending the Rangers to the second round.\n\nRangers trade Artemi Panarin to Kings for Liam Greentree, draft picks\n\nEx-Rangers captain Jacob Trouba throws shade, ‘having more fun’ in Anaheim\n\nRangers running out of time to trade Artemi Panarin before NHL roster freeze\n\nRangers coach provides brief Artemi Panarin update, waiting for trade",

    "description": "We're hiring! Join the Converge team in NYC and do your best work!",
    "fullText": "Help us build everything a consumer brand needs to grow. We’re just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). You’ll be shipping end-to-end product and working directly with customers.\n\nWe want to profitably grow the world's consumer brands. That begins with helping them understand which marketing efforts are driving profitable growth.\n\n200+ consumer brands, including publicly traded companies, rely on Converge to check in on their marketing performance up to a dozen times a day. They drill down to figure out what's working and decide where to shift million-dollar marketing budgets.\n\nTo ship even more, we've raised $5.7M from some of the best investors, including Y Combinator, General Catalyst, and the founders of Posthog, Algolia, Shipbob, ...\n\nShip product fully end-to-end. All the way from designing the system and data models to building out the interface and polishing the experience.\n\nWe trust you to build the best solution to a customer's problem. We lead with context and give you full autonomy to design the solution. This means you'll need to build a deep understanding of the problem, obsess over the solution, and ship it.\n\nWork directly with customers. You'll talk to them, ship, get feedback, and iterate. There are no middlemen. This means you can move incredibly fast: you message a customer, create a PR, and can have it fixed within hours.\n\nSome examples of projects you could own:\n\nEffortless Slack conversations: Customers screenshot their Converge reports up to a dozen of times a day (!) to share with the rest of the company. Instead, they should be able to directly tag and message a teammate from any number in Converge and have this synced bidirectionally with Slack.\n\nCentralizing all growth efforts: Converge already centralizes all growth metrics, but the information explaining them is still scattered. We want overlay the context that actually explains trends like pricing updates, budget changes, and promo calendars.\n\nCreative analytics: All growth teams use a separate tool to iterate on ad creatives, but they would want to run this workflow on Converge. We should build a Creative Analytics product on top of our data.\n\nAI agents: We never wanted to jump on the AI train for the sake of hype. But now that we have the foundations in place, there's huge leverage in building agents that can help growth teams understand their data and act on it more quickly.\n\nWe're a team of just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). Join us if you want to get rid of office politics and just take ownership to get a lot done.\n\nEven though you join early, this job comes with real engineering challenges. We process $4B in online orders annually, 20TB of data flows through Converge each month, and we've collected around 10B customer interactions to date.\n\nWhat you're shipping will actually get used. 50% of our customers use us daily (!), while this is only 13% for the average SaaS company. You will have an immediate impact.\n\nWe love working in-person. You'll like it here if you do too.\n\nIf you think you could be a founder, there's no better way to learn than to talk to customers and ship. That's what you'll be spending all of your time on. We obsess over the details and will share honest feedback.\n\nStrong experience working across the stack (4+ YOE). We work with React, Python, Postgres, and Clickhouse. Experience building data-intensive products or familiarity with Clickhouse is a plus.\n\nYou've previously built products or large features fully end-to-end.\n\nYou obsess over the quality of what you're building, both in UX and code.\n\nSalary: $175K - $240K + equity (0.6% - 0.85%).\n\nPrivate health, dental, and vision insurance.\n\nIntro call (30 min): We want to learn about your motivations to join Converge, determine why you’d be a great fit, and answer any questions you have for us.\n\nTechnical (1h): We work through a typical engineering problem we face at Converge.\n\nCulture (45 min): We dive into your past experiences to learn how you like to work and what motivates you.\n\nSuperday (1 day): Join us for a day to actually build something! You get to meet the team, we get to meet you, it's great. (fully paid)\n\n(*) This can all be done in 2 days. If you want to move quickly, we do too. Our founding engineer was on a plane to meet us just days after our first call.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON/NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Oil refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast are struggling to absorb a rapid surge in Venezuelan crude shipments since last month's flagship $2 billion supply deal between Caracas and Washington, pressuring prices and leaving some volumes unsold, according to traders and shipping data.\n\nWhat challenges are U.S. refiners facing with Venezuelan crude?\n\nHow might India's trade deal affect Venezuelan oil sales?\n\nWhat role do trading houses play in Venezuelan exports?\n\nHow has Venezuelan oil export volume changed recently?\n\nThe soft U.S. demand represents ​an early obstacle for President Donald Trump's hopes of sending the majority of the South American country's oil to the United States since U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro ‌last month in a raid in Caracas.\n\nTrading houses Vitol and Trafigura were granted U.S. licenses to market and sell millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil following the U.S. operation and a subsequent supply agreement with interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\nThe trading houses, ‌which joined energy major Chevron in holding approval to export Venezuelan oil, struck several early deals to sell some cargoes to refiners in the U.S. and Europe. However, with Chevron also raising exports quickly, the trading companies are now finding it harder to secure enough buyers among Gulf Coast refiners, traders said.\n\n\"We're all facing this issue where there's more to place and not enough takers,\" one of the traders said, citing reluctance from U.S. refiners to buy Venezuelan crude. Some refiners are complaining that prices, albeit declining, remain high compared to competing Canadian heavy grades.\n\nVenezuelan heavy oil cargoes for delivery at the Gulf Coast are being offered at ⁠about $9.50 per barrel below benchmark Brent, versus discounts of between $6 and $7.50 per ‌barrel in mid-January.\n\nLast month, total Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. almost tripled to 284,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data based on tanker movements.\n\nThe U.S. was absorbing some 500,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil before Washington imposed sanctions on the country in 2019. But exports to the U.S. went to zero in mid-2025 ‍after Trump revoked all licenses to trade and ship.\n\nReaching the U.S. refiners' maximum capacity again will require time, one of the traders said, in part because some facilities would require adjustments to process heavier oil.\n\nThe chief executive of refiner Phillips 66, Mark Lashier, said on Tuesday the company can process around 250,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude, but prices must be competitive for Venezuelan grades to displace other sources of heavy oil.\n\nChevron and Trafigura declined to comment. ​Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA and Vitol did not reply to requests for comment.",

Free groceries for everyone.\n\nTomorrow 12pm.\n\nWest Side Market | 84 3rd Ave. NYC pic.twitter.com/rsrunK5brt\n\nBut Polymarket says it's going even bigger, opening its own grocery store in the city next week — \"New York's first free grocery store\" — for a limited time.\n\n\"The Polymarket is fully stocked. No purchase required. We're open to all New Yorkers,\" the company said. \"Free groceries. Free markets. Built for the people who power New York. We'll see you at The Polymarket's grand opening next week.\"\n\nAfter months of planning, we're excited to announce 'The Polymarket' is coming to New York City.\n\nNew York's first free grocery store.\n\nWe signed the lease. And we donated $1 million to Food Bank For NYC — an organization that changes how our city responds to hunger. 🧵 pic.twitter.com/BGMCWUMz8n\n\nThe address has yet to be announced by the company, but Polymarket says the store will be open from Thursday, February 12 at noon until Sunday, February 15.\n\nThe prediction market also says it donated $1 million to Food Bank for New York City. A spokesperson for Food Bank for New York City confirmed the donation to Business Insider.\n\n\"The activation is the result of months of planning — from securing permits and building out a dedicated retail space to coordinating logistics and nonprofit partnerships — and represents a direct investment in the city where Polymarket was founded and scaled,\" reads a release from the prediction market platform.\n\nKalshi and Polymarket have exploded in popularity over the last year and a half, and the giveaways are likely to raise the companies' profiles and brand recognition even further.\n\nBoth prediction markets have moved to partner with media organizations. Polymarket partnered with the Golden Globes and Dow Jones, while Kalshi has struck deals with CNN and CNBC.\n\nPrediction markets have also faced greater scrutiny from lawmakers, especially after an anonymous Polymarket trader made hundreds of thousands of dollars off a well-timed bet on former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's political future, sparking concerns about insider trading.\n\nThat's led some prediction markets to push back, with Kalshi emphasizing that it has rules against insider trading and supports efforts to regulate the practice.\n\nUpdate, February 3, 2026 — This story has been updated to clarify Food Bank of New York's involvement with the Polymarket initiative.",

    "description": "I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, for a slower pace of life and lower costs. Although I found both of those things, I feel lonely in my new city.",
    "fullText": "After two years of living in New York City, I realized that, although I loved life in the Big Apple, I wasn't fond of the exorbitant cost of living.\n\nMy days in the city were busy — think last-minute Broadway tickets, venturing out to Brooklyn for my photojournalism class, and bottomless brunches that turned into all-day affairs. Still, I found that leaving my apartment was costly, and I knew I needed a change.\n\nSo, moving to Charlotte, North Carolina, seemed like a practical decision. My dad was an hour and a half away, the culture felt less cutthroat, and the cost of rent didn't make me cringe.\n\nAt first, the change was refreshing. I traded crowded subway cars for tree-lined streets and pricey rooftop bars for local breweries.\n\nI even went from paying $4,600 a month for a studio apartment in NYC to $2,489 for an updated one-bedroom apartment with tons of amenities.\n\nHowever, as I began settling into life in Charlotte, the slower pace that I craved began to feel isolating.\n\nOn paper, my job sounds exciting — telling people I'm a travel writer is an instant conversation starter. But behind the trips, Instagram-worthy pictures, and articles, most of my work happens alone.\n\nWorking for a small media company means I don't have coworkers, either. Aside from one weekly meeting with my boss, my days are quiet until I leave for my next work trip.\n\nLuckily, when I'm traveling on assignment, I'm rarely alone. From striking up conversations with crew members to befriending fellow travelers, I'm constantly meeting new people from all walks of life.\n\nThose interactions are among the most rewarding parts of my job, but they only happen a few days each month.\n\nPlus, I often leave these trips feeling drained, which makes it hard to put myself out there and build new friendships when I'm home in Charlotte.\n\nBack in New York, I already had established relationships, which meant I didn't feel like I was \"starting over\" whenever I returned from a trip.\n\nAnd although I've tried finding a community in Charlotte through networking events, friend-of-a-friend invitations, and coffee meet-ups, I realized that building genuine connections postgrad is a slow and painful process — especially when you don't have any built-in social circles from work.\n\nAlthough there's plenty to do in Charlotte, many of the events have started to feel familiar and repetitive, rather than exciting and new — especially after living in the city for over three years.\n\nAt times, I appreciate the quieter lifestyle. However, after a while, the coffee shops, breweries, and parks all seem to blur together.\n\nAlthough I was usually sitting at the same few bars in New York, I never knew what characters would stroll by outside, or what subway performers I'd see in transit.\n\nIn Charlotte, though, even small errands and walks with my dog feel mundane. The predictability of walking the same streets, seeing the same faces, and sitting in the same traffic on I-77 makes Charlotte feel a lot smaller than it is — and, at times, isolating.\n\nBuilding a life in North Carolina has taken longer than expected, and some days, the seemingly endless tapping of my lone keyboard amid the hum of my air purifier is deafening.\n\nHowever, I don't regret my decision to move here.\n\nMy partner and I can now afford a lifestyle that seemed out of reach in New York. We have space to entertain, and the lower cost of living means we can splurge on our hobbies, including our ever-growing Lego collection, traveling, or concert tickets.\n\nAnd although I haven't quite solved the loneliness part just yet, I'm trying to show up",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants have suffered another setback in their search for an offensive coordinator, as Davis Webb has opted to remain with the Denver Broncos in a promotion rather than join the team in East Rutherford.\n\nWebb, a former Giants third-round draft pick in 2017 who started one game for Big Blue in the 2022 season finale, interviewed for the vacant OC position under new head coach John Harbaugh.\n\nThe Giants requested the interview in late January, viewing Webb's rising reputation -- bolstered by his work developing quarterbacks like Russell Wilson and Bo Nix in Denver -- as a strong fit for guiding young signal-caller Jaxson Dart.\n\nHowever, on Monday, the Broncos promoted Webb from passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach to offensive coordinator, filling the vacancy created by the recent firing of Joe Lombardi following Denver's deep playoff run.\n\nSources: Denver’s passing game coordinator Davis Webb has reached agreement to become the Broncos’ offensive coordinator. Webb interviewed for three head coaching jobs during this hiring cycle, had other offensive coordinator opportunities, but opted to remain with the Broncos. pic.twitter.com/pYVZTJPNWD\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) February 2, 2026\n\nThis decision allows Webb to stay under head coach Sean Payton, another ex-Giant, where he has thrived since joining the staff in 2023 after retiring from playing.\n\nThe Giants had hoped to pair Harbaugh with Todd Monken, his former OC in Baltimore, but Monken took the Cleveland Browns head coaching job. The team has conducted virtual interviews with other candidates, including Jim Bob Cooter, Kliff Kingsbury, Brian Callahan, and Alex Tanney, with in-person meetings expected soon for finalists.\n\nWhile Webb's familiarity with the organization and his offensive acumen made him an intriguing option, his choice to accept the Broncos' promotion leaves the Giants continuing their pursuit of a proven play-caller to elevate the offense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Davis Webb won't become New York Giants' OC, opts to remain in Denver",

    "description": "Some Uber Eats workers in NYC will have their accounts reactivated under a settlement. The move addresses a major pain point for delivery drivers.",
    "fullText": "New York City is taking aim at one of the biggest complaints from gig workers: Account deactivations.\n\nOn Friday, the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, or DCWP, said that Uber Eats would reinstate the accounts of as many as 10,000 people that were deactivated between December 2023 and September 2024.\n\nThe reactivations are part of a settlement under which Uber Eats, Fantuan, and HungryPanda will pay a cumulative $5.2 million over violations of New York City's minimum pay law for delivery workers. Some of that money will be paid out to roughly 49,000 delivery workers in New York City as damages, according to the DCWP.\n\nBoth the reinstatements and the payouts are meant to compensate workers after the apps either didn't pay workers or deactivated their accounts after customers cancelled their orders, according to the DCWP. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAffected workers should have their accounts automatically reactivated, a spokesperson for the DCWP told Business Insider. Delivery workers who don't get back on to the app but believe that their accounts were deactivated due to their cancellation rates should file a complaint with the Department, the spokesperson added.\n\nNew York City's settlement is the latest government effort to regulate deactivations among gig workers. Last year, Seattle implemented a law regulating how gig work apps deactivate workers' accounts. The law requires the app to provide 14 days of notice before a deactivation and says that a human must review the choice, for instance.\n\nThe settlement is also New York City's latest action related to gig workers since Mayor Zohran Mamdani took office one month ago. Since then, the city has warned delivery apps over their pay practices and started enforcing a law aimed at increasing delivery workers' earnings from tips.\n\nFor delivery workers on apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash, deactivations can pose a major threat to their earnings.\n\nThe delivery services often deactivate accounts with little warning or explanation, Business Insider has reported previously. As independent contractors, delivery workers don't have the same protections as full-time employees. All the while, gig workers can miss out on work and earnings.\n\nWhile some workers try to fight the deactivations, many apps require them to go through binding arbitration, which means that workers can't appeal the decision about their account.\n\nHave a tip?

Jackson case that overturned the federal right to an abortion.\n\nThe court has also been rocked by revelations about disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate about a case involving Idaho’s abortion ban, a battle over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nRoberts’ decision to impose NDAs came just weeks after the Times quoted from the confidential immunity memos, according to the Times.\n\nThe move comes as critics are calling for more transparency at the Supreme Court, which is facing record-low public trust as the conservative justices greenlight the vast majority of Trump’s policies.\n\nRoberts, however, went in the other direction and mandated more secrecy, not less.\n\nThe last time prior to 2024 that Supreme Court clerks were asked to sign a document agreeing to abide by the court’s confidentiality rules appears to have been in the late 1990s, after a former clerk published a tell-all book in 1998, according to the Times.\n\nThose documents, however, did not amount to legal NDAs, according to some of the clerks that signed them.\n\nThe switch to formal contracts is “a sign of the court’s own weakness” and the erosion of internal cohesion, Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor, told the Times.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks are among the franchises that have been linked to Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo on the trade market.\n\nIf the Knicks were to trade for the two-time MVP before the upcoming Feb. 5 trade deadline, there would be no excuse for New York to fall short of an NBA Finals appearance for the second consecutive season.\n\nAccording to a recent report from ESPN’s Brian Windhorst, it’s clear how New York feels about trading for Antetokounmpo this season.\n\n“The Knicks believe in this team,\" Windhorst said Monday. “They believed in this team last summer when Giannis was loosely available in those discussions. They didn't make an aggressive offer at the time to progress those talks.”\n\n“If they want to win a bidding war now, I think it's going to take a three or four-team trade where they take some of their players and get other assets for them, and then come back to the Bucks and make very strong offers. That is just not happening. They are not showing that aggression to get Giannis right now, and I think that's because they like this team.\"\n\nThe Knicks’ stance on potentially acquiring Antetokounmpo from Milwaukee wouldn’t have made sense a few weeks ago. After starting the year with a 23-9 record, the franchise lost nine of its next 11 games and appeared to be headed toward a complete meltdown.\n\nHowever, the Jalen Brunson-led Knicks have turned things around since then, winning six straight games, with five of them being double-digit victories.\n\nAlthough Antetokounmpo has the championship experience New York is missing, it’s understandable that the Knicks would want to roll with their current group and attempt to bring a title to New York in June.\n\nMore NBA: Lakers linked to trade for 'sleeper' $37.7 million Warriors guard",

    "fullText": "The House Committee on Education and Workforce has asked the University of Utah to schedule a briefing to discuss the school’s plans to take money from a New York-based private equity firm.\n\nThe committee, which has jurisdiction over federal education policy, is examining the growing trend of schools seeking institutional partners to capitalize their athletic departments. The group is assessing whether legislative action might be needed to address concerns about the downstream impact of these deals.\n\nColorado's Dempsey Goes From House Objector to China Scholar\n\nSports Tech Mergers Double in Value in 'Landmark Year'\n\nCollege Recruiting Costs Shrink as Football Powers Adapt to Portal\n\nIn a letter sent to Utah president Taylor Randall on Monday morning, a copy of which was viewed by Sportico, the committee requested that the school share information regarding the details and motives behind its potential partnership with Otro Capital, which its trustees greenlit in December.\n\n“While recognizing the escalating costs in collegiate athletics, including revenue share obligations under the House v. NCAA settlement, NIL-related expenses and coaching salaries, the committee seeks to better understand the university’s rationale for entering into this arrangement,” committee chair Tim Walberg (R—Mich.) and Burgess Owens (R—Utah), a former NFL and University of Miami player and chairman of the subcommittee on Higher Education Workforce Development, wrote in the letter. “The information and briefing requested will assist the committee in determining whether legislative action may be necessary to protect students, schools and the integrity of college athletics.”\n\nAs conversations between schools and institutional funds have grown more public, so too have concerns from lawmakers. Last month, on the verge of the College Football Playoff title game, Reps. Michael Baumgartner (R—Wash.) and Haley Stevens (D—Mich.) wrote a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker asking him to limit the emergence of PE deals that “threaten the integrity of university governance and the quality of college sports in ways that will have disastrous consequences for athletes, students and fans.”\n\nLocal state-level lawmakers in both Utah and Washington have proposed bills that would also make it harder to execute these deals.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce’s letter to Randall requests that the university share terms of the arrangement and answer three specific questions:\n\nWhat factors and considerations led the university to pursue this partnership, and why was this approach selected over other potential financing options?\n\nWhat steps is the university taking to maintain institutional control and to protect student-athlete welfare, including compliance with Title IX under this partnership structure?\n\nHow might this partnership affect student costs, particularly with respect to mandatory student fees that subsidize the athletic department, and are any changes to the fee structure anticipated following implementation?\n\nRepresentatives for Utah and its athletic department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe University of Utah trustees voted during their December meeting to allow Randall, athletic department Mark Harlan and others to finalize a deal with Otro. While it’s unclear if that final arrangement has been signed, the structure of the deal was openly discussed. Utah is spinning the Utes’ athletics revenue streams into a for-profit entity, and plans to sell an equity stake in that business.\n\nRandall played a prominent part in the formal 110-minute pitch to the trustees, helping explain the macro reasons why Utah is seeking the money, and why Otro Capital was the right partner.\n\nFinancial specifics, however, have been sparse. The school has declined to share details on a deal that likely tops nine figures. A Sportico open records request for any term sheet between the school and Otro, filed back in September, is yet to be fulfilled following multiple university extensions.\n\nUtah is not alone in seeking institutional money to adapt to the modern economics of college sports. The Big Ten, for example, was recently on the verge of a $2.4 billion partnership with a California pension fund, but those talks are now on hold after pushback from some conference members about the 20-year revenue share commitment that came with the deal.\n\nThe Big 12 is in advanced talks on a potential $500 million deal with Collegiate Athletic Solutions (CAS), a fund backed by RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital, that would let schools take upfront money in exchange for revenue sharing on the back end. That deal, unlike the proposals involving Utah and the Big Ten, does not involve any equity changing hands.\n\nSeparately, a number of other schools, such as Kentucky and Clemson, have created similar separate commercial entities, but they are yet to take outside institutional investment. Those deals are widely considered necessary step for public schools to take on institutional money for athletics.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce, which dates back to 1867, has 21 majority members, and 16 minority members. Under House Rule X, the committee is tasked with reviewing and coordinating “laws, programs and government activities relating to domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student assistance within the jurisdiction of other committees.”\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2025?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings\n\nEverything to Know About the 2025 Emirates NBA Cup",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets are going through the process of hiring their next offensive coordinator after Tanner Engstrand's shocking dismissal.\n\nAccording to multiple reports including ESPN, the Jets are down to three candidates. That list includes Greg Roman, Frank Reich, and Darrell Bevell.\n\nAll three candidates possess previous experience coordinating NFL offenses.\n\nJets Wire has ranked them from best to worst.\n\nGreg Roman spent the previous two campaigns coordinating the Los Angeles Chargers offense for Jim Harbaugh. He previously worked under John Harbaugh with the Baltimore Ravens and was key throughout Lamar Jackson's formative years. Roman failed to maximize Justin Herbert in L.A., but his track record is better than the alternatives.\n\nFrank Reich has been the overwhelming favorite to become Aaron Glenn's coordinator and play caller. Reich enjoyed a fairly successful stint as the Indianapolis Colts' head coach (2018-22), but the follow-up job he did with the Carolina Panthers was disastrous. A decision could arrive this week.\n\nDarrell Bevell was Pete Carroll's long-term offensive coordinator with the Seattle Seahawks. Since then, his reputation has taken a negative turn. Bevell coordinated a bad Detroit Lions offense in 2020 before becoming their interim head coach following Matt Patricia's midseason firing, and the same thing happened to him in 2021 in Jacksonville with Urban Meyer.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Ranking the Jets' 3 OC candidates from best to worst",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants face a critical wide receiver need heading into the offseason, as highlighted in Pro Football Focus' analysis of teams' biggest priorities for free agency and the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nPFF believes the Giants should focus on adding a receiver at No. 5 overall. Specifically, Ohio State wideout Carnell Tate.\n\nBiggest Need: Wide receiver Target: WR Carnell Tate, Ohio State\n\nMalik Nabers flashed star potential as a rookie in 2024, ranking eighth out of 133 qualifying wide receivers in PFF overall grade (86.7). He appeared in just four games this season before suffering a torn ACL, so we didn’t get an opportunity to see how he would develop with quarterback Jaxson Dart.\n\nBeyond Nabers, the Giants' wide receiver unit looks thin, especially since slot specialist Wan'Dale Robinson is heading into free agency and may not be back with the team. Sometimes overshadowed by Jeremiah Smith at Ohio State, Tate is a polished prospect in his own right after finishing fifth in the FBS with an 89.0 PFF receiving grade. He also did not drop a single pass across 66 targets this season.\n\nNabers' injury-shortened 2025 campaign underscores the urgency for depth and a reliable complement.\n\nTate, a 6-foot-3 OSU standout, offers elite reliability -- boasting a near-perfect drop rate and strong efficiency even while sharing targets with top talents. His high PFF grades and production (875 yards and nine touchdowns in 2025 despite missing time) position him as a potential top-10 pick, frequently mocked to the Giants at No. 5.\n\nTargeting Tate makes strategic sense to bolster Jaxson Dart's options and build around Nabers long-term. While the draft class is deep, passing on a polished, high-upside receiver like Tate could prolong the Giants' offensive struggles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Should New York Giants target WR Carnell Tate?",

    "fullText": "The New York Knicks spoiled what might have been LeBron James's last game at Madison Square Garden, stretching their win streak to six games with a 112-100 victory.\n\nOG Anunoby scored 25 points and reserve Landry Shamet added 23 to lead the Knicks.\n\nFour-time NBA Most Valuable Player James, a 41-year-old Lakers star, remains uncommitted beyond this season, his NBA-record 23rd. But he says playing at the Garden has meant \"everything\" to him.\n\n\"It's the Mecca of basketball in New York. It's the Big Apple. Being at MSG, so many guys have walked this court, basketball, entertainment, actors, musicians, everything. It has been a wide range of America, the people, to grace this floor,\" James said.\n\n\"I hope I'm like a small snippet of somebody that came through here and was able to make a little small dent from a visitor's perspective. It's always cool in here. I've always loved these fans.\"\n\nWhile not saying it was his Garden farewell, James noted, \"When the time comes it will always have a special place.\"\n\nJosh Hart added 20 points for the Knicks while All-Star guard Jalen Brunson had 12 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists.\n\n\"We've just been playing together,\" Brunson said of their win streak. \"Sticking together, that's the biggest part, having each other's back holding each other accountable.\n\n“We have to continue to do that. Can't be satisfied. It's a collective effort.\"\n\nThe Knicks improved to 31-18, second in the Eastern Conference behind Detroit.\n\nThe Lakers fell to 29-19 despite 30 points from Luka Doncic and 22 from James, who was named to his record 22nd NBA All-Star Game as a reserve by NBA coaches.\n\n\"Super humbling,\" James said. \"Mad respect to the coaches. \"Playing at the latter stages of my career and still able to be an All-Star, it means a lot.\"\n\nIt was the first Laker loss of the season after leading at half-time.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 34 points and added 13 assists while Cason Wallace had a career-high 27 points with seven three-pointers as reigning champions Oklahoma City won 121-111 at Denver.\n\n\"We knew we were going to have to bring it in this building if we wanted to get a W,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said.\n\nFrench star Victor Wembanyama delivered 25 points, eight rebounds, five blocked shots, four steals and two assists to ignite San Antonio's 112-103 home triumph over Orlando.\n\nThe game was pushed back to a night contest after the Spurs (33-16) had trouble flying out of snowstorm-hit Charlotte.\n\nCleveland's Jarrett Allen scored 40 points and grabbed 17 rebounds as the Cavaliers won 130-111 at Portland.\n\nDetroit claimed the most lopsided victory in team history as Jalen Duren scored 21 points while Cade Cunningham had 18 points and 12 assists in a 130-77 rout of visiting Brooklyn.\n\nSwedish guard Pelle Larsson and Bam Adebayo each scored 20 points as host Miami ripped Chicago 134-91, the third-biggest rout in Heat history.\n\nJaylen Brown had 30 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Boston Celtics over Milwaukee 107-79.\n\nRJ Barrett scored 21 points and Brandon Ingram added 19 for Toronto in a 107-100 home victory over Utah. Finland's Lauri Markkanen led the Jazz with 27 points.\n\nWashington rookie Will Riley scored 18 points off the bench to lead the host Wizards over Sacramento 116-112, stretching the Kings' losing streak to six games.\n\nKawhi Leonard scored 20 points and Ivica Zubac had 14 points and 20 rebounds to spark the Los Angeles Clippers to a 117-93 triumph at Phoenix.",

    "description": "Courtney Kinnare's art career has taken off since moving from LA to NYC. But in one of the most expensive cities in the world, it comes at a cost.",
    "fullText": "A couple of years out of college and in the midst of a pandemic, Courtney Kinnare took several big risks. The Californian quit her job in sustainable packaging design in Los Angeles, became a full-time artist, and moved to New York City.\n\n\"I just took the leap,\" said Kinnare, now 29. \"I was just like, if I go for it, I have no choice but to make it work out.\"\n\nShe wasn't totally prepared for what it would cost her. When Kinnare moved across the country in 2021, New York City rents began to rise as many others returned after the pandemic. Like many artists, she pays double rent — for her apartment and her studio — and her income swings dramatically, making it hard to budget.\n\nAt the same time, living in New York has turbocharged Kinnare's career. She's constantly meeting gallery owners, seeing new art, and getting exposure to new customers. But while her income has more than doubled in a few years, she often works seven days a week — and the money she makes doesn't go very far.\n\nKinnare is among a growing share of New Yorkers struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world, as the costs of necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that has driven up rents and home prices.\n\nNew York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, got elected on a pledge to bring these costs down, including for artists. In January, he promised to \"make New York affordable to make the arts,\" and said his administration would also make arts and culture more accessible for working-class people. He's facing a dismal trend. After years of growth in the creative industries, the city has lost a significant number of artists since the pandemic.\n\n\"I've always been able to figure it out,\" Kinnare said, but, \"every month I'm like, 'Okay, how am I making money this month?'\"\n\nWhen she first arrived in the city, Kinnare spent $2,000 on rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn that she also used as her art studio. Eventually, she moved in with two roommates and rented a separate studio, where she had more room to grow her craft.\n\nLast year, she moved in with her partner, and spends about $1,000 a month for her share of the $2,600 rent for their Bed-Stuy loft, and another $1,700 on her studio space in Dumbo.\n\nOver the last few years, she's steadily grown her art sales and income, which started around $50,000 a year when she first moved to the city, and last year exceeded $100,000. That's in part because one of her products — a $45 purse hook — took off late last year. She quickly sold out of her first 1,500 hooks, made of metal, glass, abalone shell, and mother-of-pearl, and designed to hang a bag from a restaurant table or bar. She recently dropped 2,000 more and hopes to make them a permanent part of her collection.\n\nDespite her recent windfall, budgeting is tricky with an income that varies dramatically month to month. \"I don't have family money to fall back on, or anyone to ask to borrow money from,\" she says.\n\nIt's taken a toll on Kinnare's social life, especially with friends who work corporate jobs and like to go out. She says she skips dinners out and has made a concerted effort to surround herself with other artists who understand the reality of having an unreliable income and the lifestyle that comes with it.\n\n\"Sometimes you blink your eyes and spend $100, and you're like, what just happened?\" she says. \"That's taken a lot of self-control to be able to find activities and things to do that don't require spending money.\"\n\nWhen factoring in the cost of living, New York creative workers like Kinnare earn about 23% less than the national average, a recent report by the nonprofit Center for an Urban Future found. A decade ago, they earned 15% less than the average. Much of that has to do with pricier real estate. With tighter living quarters in the city, many artists rent a separate studio space to work on their craft.\n\nFinding a studio space with enough room and natural light was even harder than finding an apartment, Kinnare says. When she was forced to move out of one studio on short notice, she struggled to find anything affordable on the market that had a window. So she resorted to messaging artists she didn't know on Instagram, asking for their landlords' contact information. \"It's a really, really fast game, and you have to be on top of it,\" she said.\n\nKinnare sees the high cost of living in New York City as an investment in her career that, so far, is paying off. She thinks it's easier to break into the art world than it was in LA, where she felt more professionally isolated.\n\n\"The art scene here is a lot more diverse and approachable,\" she said. \"I'm frequenting galleries a lot more, going to openings, going to shows, being in places where I want to be, networking and seeing and having the chance to talk to some of these people.\"\n\n\"The exposure here has been tenfold compared to what I've been used to,\" she added.\n\nLast year, she signed with a gallery after meeting their owners at a design fair and has since shown her work at multiple fairs with them.\n\nStill, the costs of breaking into the most dynamic creative scene in the country are high — and a growing number of creatives aren't making it. Many artists who left New York when COVID hit haven't returned. The number of New Yorkers working in the creative economy, including self-employed people, has dropped by about 6% since 2019, the Center for an Urban Future found. The city has lost nearly one-fifth of its dancers and film and video editors. More than a quarter of its fashion designers have disappeared.\n\nKinnare feels like one of the lucky ones. Her sales and social media following are growing, and she finally has some savings. One of her goals for 2026 is to give herself one day a week when she doesn't open her laptop or step inside the studio.\n\n\"I feel like I'm finally, after four years, at a place where I can breathe a little bit, but the grind never stops,\" she says. \"You can never get too comfortable.\"",

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees reportedly “checked in” on Dodgers free agent Michael Kopech this offseason, per the New York Post’s Jon Heyman.\n\nKopech entered free agency after spending a majority of 2025 on the injured list with the Dodgers. The reliever began the regular season on the injured list with a shoulder injury and transferred to the 60-day injured list at the beginning of May 2025.\n\nHe returned to the team the following month, but returned to the injured shortly after with a right knee injury. Kopech returned once again at the beginning of September, but re-aggravated his knee injury at the end of the season and missed the postseason.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Sign Brother of Current LA Starter to Minor League Deal\n\nThe right-hander joined the Dodgers at the trade deadline in 2024, switching to the National League from the Chicago White Sox.\n\nThe 29-year-old made an instant impact after arriving with the Dodgers, and became one of their most important weapons out of the bullpen. He had a 1.13 ERA with L.A. in 2024, and maintained a 3.00 ERA during their World Series charge in the playoffs.\n\nEven though he struggled with injury last season, the right-hander still performed will in 2025. He had a 2.45 ERA through 14 appearances with the Dodgers last season.\n\nThe Dodgers have already reinforced their bullpen this offseason so re-signing Kopech is unlikely, but whichever team grabs him will get a high-quality reliever for the upcoming season.\n\nThe post Dodgers World Series Champion Linked to Yankees appeared first on LA Sports Report.",
