    "fullText": "Aaron Glenn is searching for a new defensive coordinator for his second season with the Jets. Here's the latest on that search...\n\nThe Jets are moving on from a number of coaches, including QB coach Charles London, DL coach Eric Washington, LB coach Aaron Curry and pass game coordinator Scott Turner.\n\nSNY's Connor Hughes said on the latest episode of Jets Final Drive that players had \"a lot\" of issues with Washington and Curry, but Turner being relieved comes as a surprise.\n\nWith the mid-season release of DC Steve Wilks, Jets coach Aaron Glenn has now relieved five coaches of their duties.\n\nThe Jets were busy in the second week of their offseason, completing a first round of interviews for eight candidates for the vacant DC job.\n\nThe team announced that they completed virtual interviews with Wink Martindale, Jim Leonhard, Chris Harris, Jim O'Neil, DeMarcus Covington, Daronte Jones, Mathieu Araujo, and Ephraim Banda.\n\nMartindale is the most senior of the group at 65 years old and has the most experience as a defensive coordinator at the NFL level. Recently, the DC at Michigan, he worked last in the NFL with the Giants, where he had a rocky relationship with then-head coach Brian Daboll. Martindale also held the DC job for four seasons in Baltimore and one in Denver.\n\nLeonhard started 40 games over three seasons as a safety for the Jets. After finishing a 10-year playing career, he entered coaching, spending several years at his alma mater, Wisconsin. He was the DC with the Badgers from 2017-22, finishing as the interim head coach for the last seven games. He made the jump to the NFL in 2024 with another of his former teams, the Broncos, where he's been a defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator for the past two seasons, adding assistant head coach to his title this year.\n\nHarris was hired to Glenn's staff last offseason to be the defensive back coach and passing game coordinator, but finished as interim DC after Steve Wilks' firing. Before coming to New York, the eight-year NFL veteran was Washington's defensive backs coach (2020-22) and Tennessee's DBs coach and passing game coordinator (2023-24).\n\nO'Neil has experience with Glenn in Detroit, where he's worked as a defensive assistant since 2024. He got his first NFL gig with the Jets in 2009 as a defensive quality control coach before serving as assistant DBs coach from 2010-12. He was Cleveland's defensive coordinator for two seasons (2014-15), along with NFL stops in Buffalo (2013), San Francisco (2016), Oakland/Las Vegas (2019-20).\n\nCovington also has experience working as a DC in the NFL, holding that position with New England during the 2024 season. He first joined the Patriots under Bill Belichick, serving as a coaching assistant, outside linebackers coach, and defensive line coach after joining in 2016. He served as defensive line coach/run game coordinator with Green Bay in 2025.\n\nJones was the passing game coordinator and defensive backs coach with the Vikings. He first came to Minnesota in 2020, leaving for one season to be LSU's defensive coordinator in 2021.\n\nAraujo spent the past four seasons, his first in the pro ranks as a coach, with Miami coaching defensive backs.\n\nBanda has been the Browns' safeties coach since 2023 after spending several years coaching in college, including a stint as the DC at Utah State (2021-22).",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks have been struggling lately, causing trade speculation around the team to grow louder.\n\nOne player who has been mentioned in trade rumors is center Karl-Anthony Towns, who has clashed with head coach Mike Brown about his role with the team this season.\n\nBut Knicks reporter Ian Begley said Thursday that New York has not had internal discussions about trading Towns.\n\n\"The Knicks are not having conversations on trading Karl-Anthony Towns,\" Begley said. \"As of Monday, it was not happening.\"\n\nMore:Bill Simmons proposes wild LeBron James for Towns trade\n\nNew York has lost nine of its past 12 games and has just three wins since the calendar flipped to 2026. The Knicks got back in the win column Wednesday with a 120-66 win against the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nBegley believes the Knicks may consider drastic trades if the team has another rough stretch before the Feb. 5 trade deadline.\n\n\"If you see another 2-9 stretch or something like that ahead of the trade deadline, I think that's when you have to consider that, 'Hey, we need to shake something up here,'\" he said.\n\nTowns is averaging 20.8 points, 11.5 rebounds and shooting 46.9% from the field this season. He is in his second season in New York after being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves before last season.\n\nTowns' max contract is fully guaranteed through the 2027-28 season, making him a difficult player to trade. But the Begley thinks Knicks are intent on keeping him for now.\n\n\"I don't think they're there yet,\" he said. \"They're not out there shopping Karl-Anthony Towns.\"\n\nThe Knicks (26-18) return to action Saturday night against the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n76ers' Tyrese Maxey lands signature shoe deal\n\nLakers legend rumored to be involved in 'NBA Europe' project\n\nESPN NBA analyst gives Lakers' season mediocre grade\n\nMichael Jordan's 'NBA on NBC' appearance disappointing for fans\n\nDeMarcus Cousins makes bold claim about LeBron James' future\n\nHeat could keep promising young player for potential Giannis trade",

    "description": "Baltimore Ravens RB Derrick Henry shares his thoughts on New York Giants head coach John Harbaugh.",
    "fullText": "There is no tougher runner in the NFL right now than Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry.\n\nThe future Hall of Famer is currently the NFL's leader in touchdowns (127) and rushing yards (13,018) among active players, and his highlight reel is filled with defenders bouncing off his invincible body.\n\nHenry began his career in Tennessee and moved to Baltimore two years ago to better his chances at a Super Bowl and played those two seasons under head coach John Harbaugh, who was fired last week by the Ravens after 18 seasons.\n\n“I love Coach. He’s a great leader,\" Henry told The Escapist in a recent interview. \"Enjoyed my time with him in Baltimore. Kind of sad that it ended while I came to Baltimore, but I wish Coach the best. I definitely appreciate everything that he’s taught us and taught me through these last two years of me being a new guy.”\n\nHarbaugh has naturally moved on to the New York Giants to become their new head coach.\n\nHenry, the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner and five-time Pro Bowler, was asked how Harbaugh treats his players. His answer should delight the Giants and their fans.\n\n“He’s had a great philosophy about how he ran the organization and how he treated the players,\" Henry said. \"After we won, he would point out every single player that had an impact on the game. Even if it doesn’t get noticed nationally, he made sure that they’re appreciated throughout the organization for the effort that they put into the team.”\n\nBut, more importantly, Harbaugh will bring structure and discipline back to the Giants. After 10 double-digit losing seasons over the past 12 years, the Giants and their fans are finally getting a coach deserving of the title.\n\n\"As we begin a new chapter in New York, our focus is simple,\" Harbaugh said in his introductory press conference with th Giants this week, \"it starts with building a team that is physical and tough, that's capable of overwhelming their opponent from beginning to end, and especially at the end, that understands how to finish, that is smart and disciplined, that plays the game the way it should be played, and that everybody watching it, including those playing it, would be proud of.\n\n\"We're going to work together. We have great and talented people to accomplish a shared mission. There will be a relentless commitment to this organization, to this city and the fans to do things the right way every single day. Nothing will be taken for granted. It will always, always be all about the team. The team, the team, the team. Thanks, Dad, for that. It'll always be about that. Now it's time to go to work.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Derrick Henry: New York Giants' John Harbaugh 'a great leader'",

    "description": "An expedition off the coast of Massachusetts has confirmed the existence of a freshwater reservoir beneath the seafloor. Now, scientists are starting to understand when and how it formed.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA giant reservoir of \"secret\" fresh water off the East Coast that could potentially supply a city the size of New York City for 800 years may have formed during the last ice age, when the region was covered in glaciers, researchers say.\n\nPreliminary analyses suggest the reservoir, which sits beneath the seafloor and appears to stretch from offshore New Jersey as far north as Maine, was locked in place under frigid conditions around 20,000 years ago, hinting that it formed in the last glacial period due, partly, to thick ice sheets.\n\nLast summer, researchers went on an expedition to follow up on reports from the late 1960s and early 1970s of fresh water beneath the seafloor off the East Coast. \"It was quite the project and sort of a lifelong dream,\" Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist and a professor of geophysics at the Colorado School of Mines, told Live Science.\n\nThe research voyage, known as Expedition 501, lasted three months and dredged up 13,200 gallons (50,000 liters) of water from beneath the seafloor in three locations off the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. The results aren't finalized yet, but so far it looks as if the reservoir might stretch farther underground than early reports suggested, meaning it might be even bigger than previously thought.\n\nDugan and his colleagues also think they know what created the reservoir thanks to preliminary radiocarbon, noble gas and isotope analyses, he said.\n\nFresh water in the region was first reported 60 years ago by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), during offshore mineral and energy resource assessments between Florida and Maine. \"In a very peculiar way, they found fresh water in the sediment beneath the ocean,\" Dugan said. \"In the 1980s, some of the USGS people came up with ideas of how that fresh water could get there. Then it went quiet for a while — no one was talking about it.\"\n\nIn 2003, Dugan and Mark Person, a professor of hydrology at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, rediscovered these records and came up with three ideas of how fresh water can end up beneath the ocean. One way that a submarine freshwater reservoir can form is if sea levels are very low for a long time and rainfall seeps into the ground. Then, when sea levels rise again over hundreds of thousands of years, that fresh water gets trapped in the underlying sediment, Dugan said.\n\nA second possibility is that tall mountains close to the ocean funnel rainwater directly down into the seabed from their high elevation point, he said. And thirdly — related to the first hypothesis — a freshwater reservoir can form under the ocean if ice sheets expand, causing sea levels to drop. Meltwater collects at the bottom of ice sheets because they grind against the bedrock, producing heat. The huge weight of the ice sheet then pushes that water into the ground, trapping it beneath layers of sediment.\n\nMore than two decades later, the researchers are finally close to getting an answer, with preliminary data indicating that most of the fresh water came from glaciers some time during the last ice age (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). \"We kind of ruled out the large topography for New England, because we don't have big mountains next to the coast,\" Dugan said. However, \"there might be a rainfall component\" blended in the glacier water, he said. \"You can imagine that in front of a glacier you have rainfall, so it's probably a mixed system.\"\n\nExpedition 501 extracted water samples from sites 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast of Massachusetts. The researchers drilled down to 1,300 feet (400 meters) below the seafloor, which was deep enough to reveal a thick layer of sediment engorged with fresh water sitting beneath a layer of salty sediment and an impermeable \"seal\" of clay and silt.\n\n\"We have a seal at the top [of the fresh water] that keeps the seawater above from the fresh water below,\" Dugan said. This seal is strong enough to separate the two layers now, but it wasn't robust enough to stop a glacier from forcing water down through it — if that is what happened. \"Whatever emplaced that water didn't care if there was a seal. There was enough energy to flush it with fresh water,\" he said.\n\nSalinity measurements showed that water freshness in the reservoir drops with distance from the shore, but it stays well below ocean salinity in the areas studied last summer. The drill site closest to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard had a salt content of 1 part per 1,000, which is the maximum safe limit for drinking water. Farther offshore, salt content was 4 to 5 parts per 1,000, and at the farthest site, the researchers recorded 17 to 18 parts per 1,000 — or about half of the ocean's average salt content.\n\n—1.2 billion-year-old groundwater is some of the oldest on Earth\n\n—Scientists discover enormous reservoir hidden in Cascades — more than twice the amount of water in Lake Mead\n\n—Enough fresh water is lost from continents each year to meet the needs of 280 million people. Here's how we can combat that.\n\n\"The important part was we collected all the samples we need to address our primary questions,\" Dugan said. \"When we're done drilling and we pull our equipment out, the holes collapse back in and seal themselves up.\"\n\nNow, scientists are studying the reservoir in finer detail, including any microbes, rare earth elements, pore space — which can help researchers better estimate the reservoir's size — and the age of the sediments, which will help narrow down when it formed. More definitive results about how and when the reservoir formed are expected in about one month's time, Dugan said.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide an understanding of the system so if and when somebody needs to use it, they have information to start from, rather than recreating information or making an ill-informed choice,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — In two decades of kicking in doors for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Joseph Bongiovanni often took on the risks of being the “lead breacher,\" meaning he was the first person into the room.\n\nOn Wednesday, he felt a familiar uncertainty awaiting sentencing for using his DEA badge to protect childhood friends who became prolific drug traffickers in Buffalo, New York.\n\n“I never knew what was on the other side of that door — that fear is what I feel today,” Bongiovanni, 61, told a federal judge, pounding the defense table as his face reddened with emotion. “I've always been innocent. I loved that job.”\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Lawrence J. Vilardo sentenced the disgraced lawman to five years in federal prison on a string of corruption counts. The punishment was significantly less than the 15 years prosecutors sought even after a jury acquitted Bongiovanni of the most serious charges he faced, including an allegation he pocketed $250,000 in bribes from the Mafia.\n\nThe judge said the sentence reflected the complexity of the mixed verdicts following two lengthy trials and the almost Jekyll-and-Hyde nature of Bongiovanni's career, in which the lawman racked up enough front-page accolades to fill a trophy case.\n\nBongiovanni once hurtled into a burning apartment building to evacuate residents through billowing smoke. He locked up drug dealers, including the first ever prosecuted in the region for causing a fatal overdose.\n\n“There are two completely polar opposite versions of the facts and polar opposite versions of the defendant,” Vilardo said, assuring prosecutors five years behind bars would pose a considerable hardship to someone who has never been to prison.\n\nDefense attorney Parker MacKay noted the judge had acknowledged Bongiovanni as a “beacon” of the Buffalo community. The government's request for a 15-year sentence, he added, was “completely unmoored to the nature of the convictions.”\n\n“As Mr. Bongiovanni told the judge at sentencing, he is innocent, and we look forward to continuing to work with him to prove that,” MacKay told The Associated Press.\n\nA jury in 2024 convicted Bongiovanni of four counts of obstruction of justice, counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and making false statements to law enforcement.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's “little dark secret” caused immeasurable damage over 11 years. They likened him to Jose Irizarry, a disgraced former DEA agent serving a 12-year federal sentence after confessing to laundering money for Colombian drug cartels.\n\nBongiovanni upheld an oath not to the DEA, they argued, but to organized crime figures in the tight-knit Italian American community of his North Buffalo upbringing. During sentencing, Bongiovanni’s family dissolved into tears on the front row of the packed courtroom in downtown Buffalo.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's corruption involved as much inaction as calculated coverup. They pointed to a turning point in 2008 when Bongiovanni could have acted on intelligence about traffickers he knew whose operation would evolve into a large-scale organization with links to California, Vancouver, and New York City.\n\nHe also was accused of authoring bogus DEA reports, stealing sensitive files, throwing off colleagues, outing confidential informants, covering for a sex-trafficking strip club and helping a high school English teacher keep his marijuana-growing side hustle. Prosecutors said he brazenly urged colleagues to spend less time investigating Italians and focus instead on Black and Hispanic people.\n\n“His conduct shook the foundation of law enforcement — and this community — to its core,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi told the judge. “That's what a betrayal is.”\n\nThe ex-agent's downfall came amid a sex-trafficking prosecution that took sensational turns, including an implicated judge who killed himself after the FBI raided his home, law enforcement dragging a pond in search of an overdose victim and dead rats planted outside the home of a government witness who prosecutors allege was later killed by a fatal dose of fentanyl.\n\nIt also involved the Pharoah’s Gentlemen’s Club outside Buffalo. Bongiovanni was childhood friends with the strip club’s owner, Peter Gerace Jr., who authorities say has close ties to both the Buffalo Mafia and the violent Outlaws Motorcycle Club. A separate jury convicted Gerace of a sex trafficking conspiracy and of paying bribes to Bongiovanni.\n\nThe prosecution also cast a harsh light on the DEA after a string of corruption scandals prompted at least 17 agents brought up on federal charges over the past decade. Last month, prosecutors charged another former agent with conspiring to launder millions of dollars and obtain military-grade firearms and explosives for a Mexican drug cartel.\n\nFrank Tarentino, the DEA’s northeast associate chief of operations, said Bongiovanni’s sentence “sends a powerful message that those who betray their badge will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”",

    "title": "Bo Bichette explains why Mets were ‘obvious’ choice in free agency",
    "description": "Bo Bichette was introduced by the Mets at Citi Field on Wednesday after signing with New York in free agency.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK — The image of the Dodgers pouring out onto the field at Rogers Centre, celebrating a victory over the Blue Jays in Game 7 of the World Series last fall, will be ingrained in Bo Bichette’s mind forever.\n\nHe still hasn’t gotten over the end of that game — and the Blue Jays’ remarkable playoff run — in the months since.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bichette was in a new jersey, introduced to his new team, in a new city. And, in some ways, he was able to relieve that pain from November.\n\nHe firmly believes that his new team, the Mets, will give him an opportunity to get back to that stage again, as early as this year, with a real chance to finish the job this time around.\n\nThat, Bichette said, was part of what tipped the scales in his negotiations with multiple teams in free agency. It’s what made it “very obvious” that he wanted to be a Met.\n\n“My first priority is winning,” Bichette said, donning his No. 19 Mets jersey for the first time. “This organization is doing everything they can to do that.”\n\nBo Bichette was asked today how long it took for him to get over Game 7 of the World Series with the Blue Jays:\n\n\"I don't know if I have yet. This is probably helping. But yeah, to be that close, you never know when you're gonna get that opportunity again, but I think this team…\n\n— Max Goodman (@MaxTGoodman) January 21, 2026\n\nBichette signed a three-year deal with the Mets last week, a $126 million pact that contains opt-outs after both his first and second seasons. It was reported that Bichette was close to a seven year, $200 million deal with the rival Phillies, but he chose the Mets hours later.\n\nWhen asked on Wednesday if he is treating his contract with the Mets as a one-year deal, one of Bichette’s agents — Greg Genske — chimed in.\n\n“His commitment is to the Mets,” Genske said. “His desire is to be here. His desire is compete for championships here.”\n\nMany fans will question that logic. The Mets missed the playoffs in 2025 and seemingly took steps back during the first half of this offseason. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, were two outs away from winning the World Series in the ninth inning of Game 7 less than three months ago. They won their division last season and advanced to the Fall Classic without Bichette, who was sidelined by a left knee sprain that kept him out until the World Series. Toronto has been active in bolstering their roster this winter. Plus, other high-spending contenders — like the Phillies — were contenders in the Bichette sweepstakes.\n\nBichette’s reasoning is rooted in the actions of owner Steve Cohen and Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns. He thinks the Mets have a roster that supports their offseason initiative to turn this franchise into a true perennial championship contender.\n\n“Mr. Cohen and David have put together an organization that is looking to win every single year, has an opportunity to win a World Series every single year and a roster that backs that up,” Bichette said. “It’s very exciting to be a part of this city, one of the best cities in the world — maybe the best city in the world. The fans, some of the best fans in the world. All of that is something I’ve always wanted to be a part of.\"\n\nThat’s part of the calculus in Bichette’s willingness to change positions heading into the 2026 season, too. He’ll be moving from shortstop to third base with the Mets, something he was open to throughout his dip into free agency, so long as he was signing with a team that gave him a good chance to win.\n\n“I’m excited for the challenge,” Bichette said. “It’s just like anything else, it’s gonna take work to be good at something. I’m willing to put in that work and we’ll get after it.”\n\nBichette will land in the middle of a formidable lineup that includes Fransisco Lindor, Juan Soto, Marcus Semien and Luis Robert, Jr., whom the Mets acquired Tuesday night in a trade with the White Sox.\n\nStearns isn’t concerned about Bichette being used at the hot corner for the first time in his professional career. He trusts that Bichette’s range at shortstop will translate to third and that he can handle the longer throws. Stearns has been prioritizing run prevention and defensive improvements all winter. Even with Jorge Polanco making a similar transition this year to now starting at first base for the Mets, Stearns is confident in this new-look group (with Semien at second and Lindor returning at shortstop).\n\n“There are going to be certain days this season, probably a lot of days this season, where we’re playing four shortstops on the infield, and that’s a pretty distinct advantage,” Stearns said. “The majority of that learning curve is going to be where to be on certain plays. Frankly, some things that may not be completely perceptible. We’re probably going to make a mistake or two. But we’re also going to have elite range around the infield and that’s pretty exciting.”\n\nBichette singled out positioning, bunt plays and a new type of throw across the diamond as the biggest challenges of this transition. Mets manager Carlos Mendoza, who will play a key role in helping Bichette with his defense this spring, has faith that the 27-year-old can pull it off.\n\n“It’s a different angle that you could take from there,” Mendoza said, “But he’s athletic and has work ethic, a lot of the things that will make the transition hopefully a lot smoother.”",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — From hitting in the clutch to testing free agency, Bo Bichette has soaked up plenty of baseball advice from his big league dad over the years.\n\nDante Bichette doesn't have much to offer about handling the hot corner, though.\n\nAfter signing a $126 million, three-year contract with the New York Mets, the younger Bichette was formally introduced by the team Wednesday and pulled on a No. 19 jersey at a packed Citi Field news conference.\n\nA two-time All-Star shortstop with the Toronto Blue Jays, Bichette will shift to third base with the Mets, who have Francisco Lindor entrenched at shortstop. Bichette said he hasn't played third since travel ball as a teenager.\n\n“I’m excited for the challenge. I mean, it’s just like anything else: It’s going to take work to be good at something, and I’m willing to put in that work and we’ll get after it,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there’s different positioning, different plays you have to deal with at third base that I’m going to have to get used to and learn, but I think that’s all attainable.”\n\nDante Bichette, in attendance Wednesday along with other family members, was a four-time All-Star outfielder from 1988-2001. Known much more for his bat than glove, he played one inning at third base for Milwaukee in 1991.\n\n“I didn’t know he did that. I had no idea,\" Bo Bichette said with a grin. \"That would be interesting to watch.”\n\nHousehold jabs aside, the new-look Mets are confident Bichette can make the switch successfully.\n\nHe didn't grade well at shortstop last year, and Bichette entered free agency this offseason willing to move to second or third. He plans to call former Toronto teammate Matt Chapman, a five-time Gold Glove winner at the hot corner, to get some thoughts about manning third.\n\n“This is a player who is universally respected for his aptitude and his work ethic on the field,\" Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said about Bichette. \"And so when you combine those two things it generally gives you comfort that they can make adjustments, make changes, and Bo is very confident that he’s going to be able to do this, and everything we’ve seen backs that up.”\n\nBichette spurned the NL East rival Philadelphia Phillies to sign with the Mets and gives them a proven hitter with a potent right-handed bat to help complement lefty slugger Juan Soto.\n\nBichette batted .311 with 18 home runs, 94 RBIs and an .840 OPS in 139 games last year for the Blue Jays, who fell one win short of a World Series title.\n\nHe hit a three-run homer off Shohei Ohtani in Game 7 of the Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and is a .330 career hitter with runners in scoring position — the third-best mark in the majors among qualified hitters since 2019.\n\nBichette batted .381 with RISP last season.\n\n“I don’t know if my eyes light up or anything like that, but definitely probably get a little bit more focus,\" he said. \"And my dad taught me a lot about it. That’s all I heard about growing up was driving in runs, so I’ve put a lot of work into it.”\n\nBichette, who turns 28 in March, gets a $40 million signing bonus payable March 15 and a $2 million salary this year. He has $42 million player options for 2027 and 2028. If he declines either option, he would receive a $5 million buyout, payable in $1 million installments each July 1 from 2036-40.\n\n“We had a lot of conversations about the different structure of the deal, and Bo had his choice of long-term deals, shorter-term deals, opt outs,\" agent Greg Genske said. “His priority was finding a place where he felt like he could get better as a player and have a chance to compete for championships.”\n\nNew York signed right-handed reliever Luis García to a $1.75 million, one-year contract. He can earn $1.25 million in performance bonuses for games pitched: $100,000 for 25, $150,000 each for 30 and 35, $175,000 for 40, $200,000 for 45, $225,000 for 50 and $250,000 for 55.\n\nGarcía, who turns 39 this month, went 2-2 with a 3.42 ERA and two saves in 58 combined appearances last season with the Dodgers, Nationals and Angels. He is 28-30 with a 4.07 ERA and 17 saves in 13 major league seasons.\n\nTo open a spot for García on the 40-man roster, infielder Tsung-Che Cheng was designated for assignment.\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump knows he's aligning himself with the progressive left when it comes to credit cards.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen in Davos on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that his call for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates isn't a standard conservative policy.\n\nIn fact, he joked that it's something that New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, might have come up with.\n\n\"I know it's sort of like… it sounds like the mayor of New York maybe came up with that,\" Trump said with a laugh.\n\nFollowing Mamdani's election in November, the two met in the Oval Office and appeared to share some common ground in remarks to the press afterwards.\n\n\"I'm conservative, but I think I'm common sense, you know?\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"People say, 'Are you a conservative?' I say, 'Yeah, but I'm a common-sense person.' I mean, I do things that aren't necessarily that conservative sometimes.\"\n\nTrump said he respected credit card companies but that consumers can't afford to pay high rates.\n\n\"Whatever happened to usury? They can't pay 28%,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump called on Congress to pass a bill capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\n\nKey Republicans in Congress have been cool to that idea, with House Speaker Mike Johnson telling reporters last week that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy and that credit card companies may \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nMany business leaders have also been critical of the idea.\n\nYet Trump's call has also been met with agreement from some progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom Trump called last week.\n\nIn Congress, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill that would do just what Trump said, capping credit card rates at 10% for a year.",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants welcomed their new head coach, John Harbaugh, at Tuesday's introductory press conference. He opened up about his past with the Baltimore Ravens and advice from long-time friend and Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid.\n\n\"Andy (Reid) is a man of few words,\" Harbaugh said, \"And his four words to me were: 'Change can be good.' That's what he said: 'Change can be good.'\"\n\nHarbaugh got his start in the NFL with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1998 and was later hired by then-head coach Reid. Harbaugh served as his special teams coordinator before leaving for Baltimore in 2008. The new Giants coach wants to replicate the success Reid saw when he left for Kansas City.\n\n\"He's a good friend,\" Harbaugh said. \"How about we do this? We'll Let's do that.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and Giants aren't scheduled to face off next season, but it's good to see Reid still has an interest in his former staff members and rivals.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs HC Andy Reid shares advice for new Giants HC John Harbaugh",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kevin Fiala had a goal and an assist, and Anton Forsberg made 28 saves after taking over for the injured Darcy Kuemper in the Los Angeles Kings’ 4-3 victory over the slumping New York Rangers on Tuesday night.\n\nAdrian Kempe, Taylor Ward and Andrei Kuzmenko also scored for the Kings, who snapped a four-game skid with only their second regulation victory in January.\n\nKuemper allowed two goals on eight shots before abruptly leaving with 38 seconds left in the first period following a collision in the crease with a charging Jonny Brodzinski.\n\nForsberg played superbly after taking over for Kuemper, a member of Canada’s Olympic roster. Kuemper also missed 2 1/2 weeks last month after taking a hit to the head during a loss at Dallas.\n\nJ.T. Miller scored two goals for the Rangers, who are last in the Eastern Conference after losing seven of eight.\n\nJonathan Quick made 23 saves in his third start and fourth appearance against the Kings, who drafted him in 2005. Quick, who turns 40 years old on Wednesday, won 370 games — 199 more than any other Kings goalie — while backstopping the club to two Stanley Cup championships during his 16 seasons in LA.\n\nKempe scored 18 seconds after the opening faceoff.\n\nOnly 42 seconds after Will Cuylle’s goal for New York, Fiala scored his 18th goal by intercepting an unwise pass by former Kings teammate Vladislav Gavrikov.\n\nMiller evened it again late in the first off Mika Zibanejad’s pass.\n\nWard put the Kings back ahead early in the second, banking in a skittering shot off Quick’s far post for his first goal of the season. After Los Angeles killed a five-on-three disadvantage for 96 seconds, Kuzmenko backhanded home a rebound of Fiala’s shot.\n\nMiller scored his 13th goal in the final seconds with Quick pulled for an extra attacker.\n\nRangers: At San Jose on Friday.\n\nKings: At St. Louis on Saturday to open a six-game road trip.",

    "description": "Taking a look at a Jets pass rusher",
    "fullText": "Over the next few months, we’ll be taking an in-depth look at some of the late season signings who are under contract for 2026, and futures signings after the end of the season. We continue today with edge defender Ochaun Mathis, who was added to the practice squad late last year and signed a futures deal after the season.\n\nThe 27-year old Mathis is listed at 6’5″ and 260 pounds and was a sixth round pick out of Nebraska in 2023 having also played at TCU. He has played 14 NFL games, recording five tackles, a quarterback hit and a forced fumble.\n\nMathis was a three-star high school recruit and headed to TCU where he played four games in 2018 and then redshirted.\n\nOver the next three seasons, he started 34 games and had over 40 tackles in each season with a total of 30 tackles for loss and 16 sacks. His best season, for which he earned second team all-Big 12 recognition, was 2020, in which he had 9.5 sacks in 10 games. However, he also earned second team recognition in 2021.\n\nAfter the 2021 season, Mathis entered the transfer portal and opted to move to Nebraska. However, he was mostly in a rotational role with the Cornhuskers, starting just two games. He was productive, though, with a career-high 48 tackles and 3.5 sacks.\n\nMathis attended the 2023 scouting combine, after which he was rated as a potential late-round pick and ended up getting selected in the sixth round by the Rams.\n\nAfter a training camp injury meant he missed preseason and the start of the regular season, Mathis struggled to crack the rotation. He ultimately made eight appearances as a rookie and had just two tackles and a hit.\n\nIn 2024, he was among the Rams’ final cuts and ended up on New England’s practice squad from where he made it onto their active roster and had two tackles and a forced fumble in five appearances. However, he was released in November.\n\nThe Eagles then signed Mathis to their practice squad and he made one appearance, with one tackle, down the stretch.\n\nHe did not play in the NFL this season, despite spending time with the Eagles, Titans and Browns. The Jets signed him to their practice squad in late December but did not elevate him for any games. They did sign him to a futures deal after the season, though.\n\nLet’s move onto some more in-depth analysis of what Mathis brings to the table as a player, based on extensive research and film study.\n\nMathis has an average sized frame but terrific length and some of his combine numbers were good. He ran a 4.73 in the 40-yard dash and posted 21 bench press reps, along with above average explosiveness and agility numbers. He improved his broad jump by another five inches at his pro day.\n\nThere are times on film when it is apparent he could benefit from adding some strength.\n\nMathis has primarily played on the edge, both in four-man fronts (at TCU) and as an outside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme (at Nebraska), so he has plenty of experience of playing both with his hands in the dirt and standing up.\n\nHe also played off the ball at times, but did not play inside, although he sometimes lined up across from an opposing tackle.\n\nMathis brings high energy and effort in pursuit and in the trenches, with many of his sacks coming as a result of relentlessness meaning he eventually gets home for a coverage sack rather than beating someone clean.\n\nMathis posted an impressive 9.5 sacks in 10 games in 2020 but otherwise had just 10 in 40 other games in his career. In addition, his pressure rates were fairly consistent but nothing special. He hasn’t had much success in NFL regular season or preseason action either, other than a few flashes.\n\nAs a pass rusher, he showcases a decent get-off and can bend the edge to a degree.\n\nHe is someone who can be effective on interior rushes if standing up at the line or stunting inside.\n\nHowever, NFL linemen have typically been able to stay in front of him or redirect him upfield.\n\nMathis is a decent run defender, who can pursue downhill and plays with good discipline on the edge.\n\nHe can be controlled and sealed off by opposing tackles on the edge but has the physicality to take on lead blockers.\n\nMathis is relentless in pursuit, with good closing speed and an ability to extend beyond his frame to wrap up and drag down ball carriers.\n\nHe averaged just over five missed tackles per season in college with eight being the most he ever had in a season.\n\nHe can make some hard hits but had one forced fumble in his college career although he has had another in the NFL.\n\nMathis doesn’t necessary showcase a mastery of a variety of pass rushing moves, but his 35.5-inch arms give him a good foundation to work with and he’s shown signs of being able to exploit a length advantage at times.\n\nHe could probably benefit from sharpening up his footwork to disguise his rush and honing his technique when ripping through as he comes around the edge, but he shows some ability to vary up his rush speed.\n\nMathis hasn’t dropped into coverage that often but he does do it from time to time and is probably more experienced at doing so than most edge defenders at this level, unless they converted from another position.\n\nMost of his six career pass breakups come from getting his hands up to deflect passes; something which he is adept at. However, on this play, despite not getting his head turned, he did a great job of staying with the back to save a potential big play.\n\nHe also intercepted a pass on a two-point conversion attempt, early on in a game TCU ultimately won 34-32.\n\nMost of Mathis’ experience on special teams has been rushing kicks, with his athletic ability on display on this field goal block.\n\nHe also made this special teams tackle and forced a fumble in kickoff coverage during 2024 regular season action.\n\nMathis’ discipline and play recognition seem sound but he perhaps lacks natural pass rushing instincts in terms of transitioning to a counter move when his initial rush is repelled.\n\nHe shows versatility and makes a great play here as he blows up the blocker to bottle up a receiver screen.\n\nHe has jumped offside a few times during his college career.\n\nMathis is regarded as a player who works hard to improve and studies and prepares hard. While he wasn’t a team captain, he is a hard worker who sets a good example. Mathis’ high school team never had a winning season, and he has played with a chip on his shoulder since then, feeling he has gone under the radar.\n\nOn-field discipline is not a major concern as he has no penalties at the NFL level and just nine in his college career, five of which were in 2021.\n\nMathis was carted off with a knee injury during training camp in his rookie season and began the season on injured reserve, although he returned to action in October. He otherwise hasn’t had to deal with major injury issues.\n\nUntil we know who the defensive coordinator is, we can’t say for sure if Mathis will be a good fit for the system, but the Jets obviously targeted him and retained him because he fits some of the things Aaron Glenn likes to do and, as noted, he played on teams with both three and four-man fronts so should be adaptable.\n\nIt’s not impossible he could have the skill-set to be considered for a position switch into an off-ball role, but that would be a long-term project.\n\nHe was a teammate of current Jets cornerback Samuel Womack in Tennessee and offensive lineman Liam Fornadel in New England.\n\nMathis has shown a few brief glimpses of his talent since being drafted but is yet to prove he can crack an NFL rotation or that he has the ability to be productive at this level if given an opportunity.\n\nNevertheless, the Jets presumably liked his potential as a draft prospect and, having brought him in for a look, opted to retain him on a futures deal – something which was far from automatic with the players on the practice squad at the end of the season.\n\nWith his combination of length and athleticism, Mathis has looked like a player who would really benefit from adding some strength and refining his technique. He’s been in the league long enough now that he needs to make an impact in camp or preseason for the organization to be compelled to keep him in their plans.",

    "description": "The New York Giants formally introduced John Harbaugh as their head coach on Tuesday, and here are nine takeaways from his press conference.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants formally introduced John Harbaugh as the 21st head coach in franchise history on Tuesday afternoon at the Quest Diagnostics Training Center in East Rutherford.\n\nThe press conference, held inside the fieldhouse, was a well-attended event, featuring the Mara, Tisch, and Koch families, as well as the Harbaugh family, general manager Joe Schoen, current and former Giants players, and an abundance of reporters.\n\nHarbaugh was introduced by Schoen and then fielded questions for roughly 20 minutes.\n\nHere are nine takeaways from the Harbaugh introductory press conference.\n\nLeading up to Harbaugh signing his contract, many reports indicated that the reporting structure served as a main cog in negotiations. In the end, Schoen and the Giants agreed that Harbaugh would report directly to ownership -- namely, CEO John Mara.\n\nHowever, Harbaugh appeared to dismiss that on Tuesday, calling the reports \"overblown.\"\n\n\"It's really not that important,\" he said. \"It's overblown just a little bit in terms of how it works... We all report to the boss, right? And the boss is ownership. And John Mara is running football operations -- and he's running it -- and I'm glad he is.\"\n\nHarbaugh made it abundantly clear that everything will be football-focused under his leadership. And while that may sound like an obvious statement, the Giants have found ways to get a bit distracted in recent years.\n\n\"To me, the number one thing is that we have to have guys that love football,\" he said. \"It's football. What are we here for? What do we do? What is this building here for? It's football.\"\n\nHarbaugh noted that everyone on the team had better love all aspects of football, from weightlifting to practice to film study, and if they don't, they can go play somewhere else.\n\nHarbaugh mentioned his father, Jack Harbaugh, several times throughout the press conference, attributing several quotes and processes to his old man.\n\nJohn Harbaugh was asked what he sees when he looks at the Giants' roster and he says his dad told him he was impressed by what he saw from the team on tape:\n\n\"When my dad told me, I knew it was true.\" pic.twitter.com/qUPBJH5w2I\n\n— Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) January 20, 2026\n\nDespite reports that several candidates had reservations about Schoen -- including Harbaugh himself -- the head coach came away \"impressed\" after multiple conversations with the GM.\n\n\"You get to know Joe, and we started talking ball, and what you see is a football man. This guy lives and breathes football,\" Harbaugh said. \"His knowledge is deep. He knows the league. . . He was impressive to me.\"\n\nHarbaugh went on to describe their conversations as a \"joy.\"\n\nHarbaugh has not shied away from what he expects of these Giants, and that's winning on Day 1 with sights set on another Super Bowl championship... And then several more.\n\n\"I know the challenges, and I understand the expectations. And I know the fans are hungry for a winner,\" he said. \"We're here with one mission: To earn the right to be called World Champions in New York.\"\n\n\"I'm planning on Day 1. That's what we'll be shooting for, working for... I fully expect it to happen.\"\n\nWhen Harbaugh spoke, you could hear some of Tom Coughlin in his messaging. He shares a similar mindset, which is what fans and players have been yearning for since Coughlin walked out the door a decade ago.\n\n\"Nothing will be taken for granted. It will always, always be all about the team. The team, the team, the team,\" he said. \"It will always be about that. Now it's time to go to work.\"\n\nHarbaugh doesn't just want the Giants to win; he wants them to dismantle and overwhelm opponents for 60 full minutes every single week.\n\n\"Our focus is simple: It starts with building a team that is physical and tough; that is capable of overwhelming their opponent from beginning to end -- especially at the end,\" he said. \"That understands how to finish; that is smart and disciplined. That plays the game the way it should be played. And that everybody watching it -- including those playing it -- would be proud of.\n\nThese are not the New York Giants; they are the New York Football Giants.\n\n\"The New York FOOTBALL Giants\" pic.twitter.com/j7VQ9D0S9Z\n\n— Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) January 20, 2026\n\n\"It's a profound honor to be entrusted with the responsibility of coaching the New York Giants Football Giants,\" he said. \"My Dad taught me that they were the New York Football Giants. They weren't just the Giants, they were the New York Football Giants.\"\n\nHarbaugh was comfortable at the podium, and he offered very little fluff. It was 20-plus minutes of pure substance, with one single quote coming across as the most important.\n\n\"I want this job,\" Harbaugh said emphatically.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 9 takeaways from Giants coach John Harbaugh's introductory press conference",

As San Francisco’s defensive coordinator, Saleh built a reputation as a top defensive mind, and Tennessee clearly hopes to lean on that expertise to upgrade a defense that struggled with consistency last season.\n\nBut Saleh’s choice also raises the stakes on his offensive coordinator hire.\n\nWith Saleh focused on defense, Tennessee must land a top-tier offensive play-caller -- not only to manage game strategy but to help develop rookie quarterback Cam Ward, the 2025 No. 1 overall pick.\n\nWard showed promise as a rookie, but his continued growth likely hinges on having an OC who can design and call an effective offense. Saleh’s expanded role gives him control where he’s strongest, but success in Nashville will depend on pairing that with elite offensive leadership.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Robert Saleh plans to call defensive plays with Tennessee Titans",

Ghislaine Maxwell case involving Epstein and should not be allowed to file a friend of the court request in the matter.\n\n\"Representatives Khanna and Massie do not have standing, their stated objectives are in-consistent with the role of an amicus ⁠as well as the role of the Court, ​and, in any event, there is no authority ​permitting the Court to grant the Representatives the relief they improperly seek,\" the DOJ said in the letter signed by Jay Clayton, US attorney ‍for the Southern District ⁠of New York.\n\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.\n\nThe Justice Department said at the end of 2025 that it had ⁠5.2 million pages of Epstein files left to review and needs 400 lawyers from four different department ‌offices to help with the process through late January.",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets announced they have interviewed eight candidates to fill their defensive coordinator vacancy. Head coach Aaron Glenn will soon make a decision to appoint Steve Wilks' successor. Among the options, Detroit Lions assistant Jim O'Neil could emerge as the favorite.\n\nO'Neil has two advantages working in his favor.

The Browns fielded a top-10 scoring defense under O'Neil in 2014, but regressed to 29th in 2015. His 49ers defense in 2016 was the worst in the league, allowing 30 points per contest.\n\nThe Jets have a mixture of intriguing candidates. Ranging from veterans like O'Neil and Martindale to Jim Leonhard and DeMarcus Covington, Glenn has a decision to make.

    "fullText": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is getting the message: He’s vulnerable to the same quick hit that President Trump ordered to pluck Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro from power and toss him into custody in New York.\n\nThe brazen Jan. 3 raid on Caracas by U.S. forces almost certainly struck more fear into the potbellied dictator than any military drills or aerial shows of force ever could. In doing so, it’s also ramped up the risks of a potential nuclear showdown as Kim goes into panic mode, triggered by the same American president who has routinely boasted of the pair’s “very good relationship.”\n\n“The operation to ‘rendition’ the president of Venezuela demonstrates the capabilities that have to be of concern to North Korea,” says Sydney Seiler, former national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council. The word “rendition,” as used by Seiler, is CIA-speak for capturing an enemy operative and sending him elsewhere for prosecution, or even torture and killing.\n\nThe other key word is “decapitation,” which Kim is well aware the Americans have been practicing in annual military exercises for years. “What’s appealing is that decapitation is the quickest way to terminate a conflict,” Seiler, who visited North Korea on negotiating teams before the North cut off all communications after the failure of Kim’s meetings with Trump in 2019, told the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n“Decapitation would be helpful in trying to deter North Korea,” Seiler believes. “Without Kim Jong Un,” he notes, North Korea would have no leader, no one who would know how to lead its outsized, underfed armed forces of 1.2 million troops, much less anyone in charge of its nuclear program.\n\nKim betrayed his deepest fears of a plot like the fracas in Caracas by authorizing release for North Korean audiences of a film all about the capture of Maduro. The film “Days and Nights of Confrontation,” could not have aired on North Korean state TV at a more propitious moment, days after elite U.S. troops seized Maduro and his wife. The message is clear: what’s to stop the Americans from repeating themselves in North Korea?\n\nThe film epitomizes “the trend of racy, Hollywood-style content aimed at appealing to young people,” says a South Korean website, NK News, that tracks North Korea. “Surely Mr. Kim and his family, including his fiery younger sister Yo-Jong, and his beloved teenage daughter, Ju-ae, would make great targets.” In one fell swoop the Americans could wipe out the dynasty that Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, founded when the Soviet Union installed him as leader of the northern half of the divided Korean peninsula after the Japanese surrender in 1945.\n\nCapturing Kim is not a new idea for American “rendition” experts.\n\n“Some White House aides believed his death would paralyze his country,” writes Joel Wit, who also joined negotiating teams to North Korea, inspecting the nuclear site at Yongbyon north of Pyongyang after North Korea signed an agreement in 1994 to stop producing nukes. “Go get Kim Jong Un, we were postured to do that,” says Wit in his tell-all book, Fallout: The Inside Story of America’s Failure to Disarm North Korea. One official is quoted as saying: “Everyone, including the North Koreans, knew killing him as part of the war plan.”\n\nMaybe the U.S. would have to marshal more than the 150 or so aircraft, and a few hundred troops, including the U.S. Army’s elite Delta Force, that were needed to grab Maduro, but Kim is well aware his family and entourage could be hustled aboard a helicopter bound for an American warship long before the Russians and Chinese could respond in support of North Korea’s military establishment, ill-fed, ill-trained and not at all ready to leap to their leader’s instant defense.\n\nIf capturing Kim sounds like mission impossible, consider his frequent appearances inspecting industrial and agricultural projects, reviewing troops, and presiding at ceremonies. He also shows up periodically at missile launches, perhaps the best time of all to catch him just as he’s making a show of pressing the button. The Americans, moreover, are steeped in the knowledge of what it will take to get him. U.S. forces have been training for years to go after him. Annual U.S.-South Korean exercises once routinely wound up with a mock “decapitation” of “the North Korean leader,” without explicitly naming Kim.\n\nThe U.S. command in Korea dropped the word “decapitation” from the war games in deference to their South Korean ally, who reminded them such language might not help in attempts at fruitless talks with the North Koreans, who now refuse to talk anyway. The word is gaining currency again with Maduro’s capture—while raising the question in Pyongyang of who might come next on the American hit list.\n\n“North Korea’s Kim expected to cling to [his] nuclear security blanket after Venezuela,” blared one headline in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. “The United States’ decapitation operation against Venezuela will reinforce North Korea’s nuclear ambitions,” read another. That warning should prompt Trump to act quickly to get rid of a nuisance who’s been plaguing the region for years with bombastic harangues, threatening his enemies with a nuclear holocaust while his own people suffer from hunger and disease.\n\nFlights of heavy American bombers do little or nothing to remove the threats posed by America’s foes. Kim knows he can laugh off another aerial show of intimidation or a useless meeting with Trump. The threat of a Maduro-style capture is far more effective. Kim’s worst fear is that the Americans, after rehearsing “decapitation” for years, will decide it’s time to finally put their plan into effect, stifling Asia’s leading terrorist just as suddenly as they whisked Maduro and his wife off to jail in New York.",

    "fullText": "If you have been hoping for a $2,000 tariff rebate check, it may not come.\n\nPresident Donald Trump gave mixed messages about the issues in a recent interview with The New York Times.\n\n\"You've promised $2,000 checks to Americans based off of your tariff revenues. When can they expect those?\" Times reporter Katie Rogers asked.\n\n\"I did do that? When did I do that?\" Trump said. \"Yeah, I'm thinking. Well, I did $1,776 for the military.\"\n\nWhen Tyler Pager, another Times journalist, followed up, asking when the checks would come, Trump replied that \"the tariff money is so substantial.\"\n\n\"That's coming in, that I'll be able to do $2,000 sometime,\" Trump said. \"I would say toward the end of the year.\"\n\nIn November, Trump posted on Truth Social proposing a $2,000 payout to all US citizens with low or middle incomes, because the government is \"taking in so much money\" from tariffs. According to a recent Supreme Court filing, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent estimated that the federal government may have collected around $1 trillion in tariffs.\n\n\"People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!\" Trump posted on Truth Social on November 9. \"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.\"\n\nEven if the Supreme Court doesn't rule his tariffs enacted under emergency powers unconstitutional in its coming decision, revenue generated by the duties may be spread too thin for a payout to Americans.\n\nLater in the interview with the Times, Trump said that the tariff revenue will go toward reducing federal government debt and funding national defense.\n\nAccording to the Treasury, the national debt as of January is around $38.40 trillion, and rose by $2.17 trillion in 2025. If Bessent's estimate on tariff revenue is correct, the total amount collected over the past year would cover less than 50% of the increase in debt.\n\nTrump also recently called for increasing the defense budget to $1.5 trillion for the fiscal year 2027. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the move would add $5.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.\n\nTrump has promised or suggested a number of payouts to Americans in his second term, including a $5,000 DOGE check, a $10,000 bonus for air traffic controllers with perfect attendance during the government shutdown, $1,000 to Trump Accounts for children who are citizens, and a $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" for active military members.\n\nAs for whether Trump even has the power to issue the checks, Congress, not the presidency, has the power of the purse and can make those appropriations.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.",
    "fullText": "If you’ve been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here’s what’s actually driving the nervousness: it’s not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.\n\nTake Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.\n\nDavid Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told The San Francisco Standard this week. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.\n\nBut that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.\n\nNow, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nBut the resistance is fierce and bipartisan. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They’ve called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and Peter Thiel’s firm leasing Miami office space last month. (Thiel has had ties to Miami for years — including a home — but an uncharacteristic press release about the move was seemingly meant to send a message.)\n\nEven Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting it. “This will be defeated, there’s no question in my mind,” he told the New York Times this week, adding that he’d been “relentlessly working behind the scenes” against the proposal. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nFor now, the union isn’t backing down. “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives,” said executive committee member Debru Carthan to the Journal last weekend. “The few who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.”\n\nThe proposal needs 875,000 signatures to make November’s ballot, where it would need a simple majority to pass.",

    "title": "The Alexander brothers head to trial this week on sex-trafficking charges. Here's what's at stake.",
    "description": "The Alexander brothers' New York sex trafficking trial is scheduled to kick off with jury selection in a Manhattan federal court on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "Brothers Tal and Oren Alexander — once among the nation's top luxury real estate brokers — along with a third brother, are set to stand trial in Manhattan this week over allegations that the trio operated a long-running sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nJury selection in the federal criminal trial is scheduled to kick off Tuesday in the same 26th-floor courtroom where last year Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was cleared of the top sex trafficking and racketeering counts against him and convicted of lesser prostitution-related charges.\n\nThe case against the Alexander brothers marks the Department of Justice's latest high-profile sex-trafficking prosecution to reach trial since the Combs case. In the aftermath of the hip-hop mogul's trial, an attorney for Tal Alexander hailed the Combs verdict as both \"refreshing\" and \"heartening\" to Business Insider.\n\nTal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander, who was an executive at his family's private security firm, have vehemently denied the sex crimes charges against them, as well as all other allegations. They've been locked up at a notorious federal jail in Brooklyn since their December 2024 arrest in Miami.\n\nThe FBI began investigating the Alexander brothers after The Real Deal first reported in June of that year that two women had filed civil lawsuits against Oren and Alon Alexander, accusing them of rape. Those lawsuits sparked a wave of additional allegations against the brothers.\n\nAttorneys for the three brothers did not respond to requests for comment by Business Insider for this story.\n\n\"The brothers were young adults navigating social situations that may not have been perfect,\" a spokesperson for the Alexanders, Juda Engelmayer, told Business Insider, \"but that is not criminal conduct and bears no resemblance to trafficking.\"\n\nIf convicted at trial, the three brothers, who are 38 and 39, could face up to life behind bars.\n\nManhattan federal prosecutors, in court papers, have accused the Alexander brothers of working together and with others to drug, sexually assault, and rape dozens of women over more than a decade in posh locales like the Hamptons, Miami, and Manhattan.\n\nProsecutors have said in court filings that several attacks happened at Hamptons mansions, while another was aboard a Bahamian-flagged cruise ship.\n\nThe Alexander brothers face 12 felony counts, including conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, according to a superseding indictment filed last week. The indictment ties the charges to eight accusers, including two who were minors.\n\nThe superseding indictment also accuses Oren Alexander of recording himself and another person \"engaging in sexual activity with a incapacitated 17-year-old girl in Manhattan.\"\n\nThe government's case rests on allegations that the Alexanders used their wealth and prominent positions \"to create and facilitate opportunities to rape and sexually assault female victims\" in a scheme that ran from roughly 2008 to 2021.\n\nOren and Tal Alexander began their real estate careers at Douglas Elliman before launching their own brokerage, Official, in 2022.\n\nProsecutors said the Alexanders sometimes planned sexual assaults in advance, luring victims to locations with the \"promise of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations.\" Other times, the Alexander brothers chose their victims by chance, prosecutors allege.\n\nProsecutors said that ahead of the sex attacks, the brothers \"shared photographs of women and girls to select those they found sufficiently attractive to invite.\"\n\n\"The defendants and other men attending the trips pooled financial resources in order to pay for flights and other travel expenses for the women and girls,\" prosecutors have said in court papers.\n\nIt will ultimately be up to the jury to decide whether the brothers are guilty of the sex trafficking charges they face.\n\nDefense attorneys for the brothers have argued in court documents that the government overreached by bringing federal sex trafficking charges because the statute requires a \"commercial sex act\" that the indictment failed to allege.\n\n\"The Government alleges, as the 'thing of value,' that Defendants 'lured' their victims with 'promises of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations.' But that is not enough to establish a 'commercial sex act,'\" defense attorneys for Tal Alexander wrote in a June motion to dismiss, which the other brothers joined.\n\nThe lawyers wrote that the accusers did not provide sex \"on account of\" those promises \"as the statute requires.\" They added that the travel and accommodations \"did not represent compensation for the sex acts.\"\n\nThe defense lawyers argued that the government's effort to frame the brothers' alleged conduct as federal sex trafficking \"rests on a dangerously overbroad theory—one that would, if accepted, convert nearly any accusation of date rape into a federal sex trafficking offense.\"",

    "description": "Griffin Canning pitched for the New York Mets in 2025.",
    "fullText": "According to a new report from Jon Heyman of the New York Post, the St. Louis Cardinals are interested in rehabbing free agent starting pitcher Griffin Canning, who spent the 2025 campaign with the New York Mets.\n\nThe Mets have shown interest in bringing back Griffin Canning, who should be ready around Opening Day after suffering an Achilles tear last year. The Cardinals and White Sox also are interested.\n\nNow 29 years old, Canning is a six-year veteran of the Los Angeles Angels and Mets. He's gone 32-37 in his career with a 4.65 ERA. He had a career-high seven wins in 2023, and again in 2025 before getting hurt. He was 7-3 with a 3.77 ERA in 16 starts for the Mets. He hasn't traditionally struck out a lot of batters, but he had 70 Ks in 76.1 innings a season ago, signaling that perhaps he's unlocked more swing-and-miss stuff.\n\nThe Cardinals could be interested in a veteran innings-eater to help keep the pressure off young prospects like Quinn Matthews and Liam Doyle. Even though it's unclear exactly when he'd be able to return to a big-league rotation, he should be able to provide good cover for those prospects. The Cardinals may be able to trade him for a prospect at the trade deadline, or perhaps they could ink him to a multi-year deal, allowing him to rehab and work through things in 2026, while flipping him at some point in 2027.\n\nThe Cardinals are rebuilding, but they should be able to provide Canning with opportunities to rebuild his value. If he's looking for a promised rotation spot and an opportunity to impress people ahead of 2027, he could take a one-year deal in St. Louis. He could also end up being dealt to a contender at the deadline, giving him a chance to win a World Series.\n\nMatthew Liberatore, Dustin May and Andre Pallante are assured rotation spots, with Richard Fitts and Hunter Dobbins likely serving as options once they are recovered from their 2025 injuries. Beyond them, Doyle and Matthews are waiting.\n\nThe one that could impact Canning negatively? Perhaps there's too many variables, too many prospects and too many possibilities in the rotation as is. Maybe the rotation spot isn't guaranteed all year, which could scare him to an organization with more security.\n\nRemember to join our CARDINALS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

O'Neil, who also added the defensive assistant title with the Lions in 2025, has been with Detroit each of the past two seasons.\n\nO'Neil, 47, has worked in the Jets organization before, serving as the Jets' defensive quality control coach in 2009 when New York advanced to the first of what would be back-to-back AFC Championship games.\n\nThe Jets boasted the NFL's No. 1 passing defense (153.7 passing yards per game), total defense (252.3 yards per game), and scoring defense (14.8 points per game) during that 2009 campaign.\n\nWe've completed virtual interviews with the following candidates for our defensive coordinator opening.\n\n— New York Jets (@nyjets) January 16, 2026\n\nIn Detroit, O'Neil has overseen one of the league's best safety tandems.

Meanwhile, Brian Branch earned Pro Bowl honors in 2024 after notching 109 tackles, 16 passes defended, eight tackles for loss, four interceptions and one sack.\n\nThe Lions allowed the second-fewest passing touchdowns (18) and registered the lowest opposition passer rating (82.0) during the 2024 season.\n\nOf course, O'Neil worked under then-Lions defensive coordinator and now-Jets head coach Aaron Glenn during the 2024 season.\n\nFor more Lions coverage,  Follow Josh on X, @JoshOnLions\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lions Wire: Detroit Lions safeties coach interviews with New York Jets for DC job",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Manhattan's top federal prosecutor said Friday that a judge lacks the authority to appoint a neutral expert to oversee the public release of documents in the sex trafficking probe of financier Jeffrey Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nJudge Paul A. Engelmayer was told in a letter signed by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton that he must reject a request this week by the congressional cosponsors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act to appoint a neutral expert.\n\nU.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, say they have “urgent and grave concerns” about the slow release of only a small number of millions of documents that began last month.\n\nIn a filing to the judge they said they believed “criminal violations have taken place” in the release process.\n\nClayton, though, said Khanna and Massie do not have standing with the court that would allow them to seek the “extraordinary” relief of the appointment of a special master and independent monitor.\n\nEngelmayer “lacks the authority” to grant such a request, he said, particularly because the congressional representatives who made the request are not parties to the criminal case that led to Maxwell's December 2021 sex trafficking conviction and subsequent 20-year prison sentence for recruiting girls and women for Epstein to abuse and aiding the abuse.\n\nKhanna said Clayton's response “misconstrued” the intent of their request.\n\n“We are informing the Court of serious misconduct by the Department of Justice that requires a remedy, one we believe this Court has the authority to provide, and which victims themselves have requested,” Khanna said in a statement.\n\n“Our purpose is to ensure that DOJ complies with its representations to the Court and with its legal obligations under our law,” he added.\n\nEpstein died in a federal jail in New York City in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The death was ruled a suicide.\n\nThe Justice Department expects to update the court “again shortly” regarding its progress in turning over documents from the Epstein and Maxwell investigative files, Clayton said in the letter.\n\nThe Justice Department has said the files’ release was slowed by redactions required to protect the identities of abuse victims.\n\nIn their letter, Khanna and Massie wrote that the Department of Justice’s release of only 12,000 documents out of more than 2 million documents being reviewed was a “flagrant violation” of the law’s release requirements and had caused “ serious trauma to survivors.”\n\n“Put simply, the DOJ cannot be trusted with making mandatory disclosures under the Act,” the congressmen said as they asked for the appointment of an independent monitor to ensure all documents and electronically stored information are immediately made public.\n\nThey also recommended that a court-appointed monitor be given authority to prepare reports about the true nature and extent of the document production and whether improper redactions or conduct have taken place.",

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees are entering the final phase of Aaron Judge’s prime, but their front office isn’t acting like it this offseason.\n\nNew York’s ongoing talks with Cody Bellinger (who might land elsewhere) are happening within the context of a painfully underwhelming offseason for Yankees fans.\n\nFirst, the Yankees were blindsided by Trent Grisham accepting his qualifying offer. Their acquisitions and retentions since then have been marginal at best: Amed Rosario, Ryan Yarbrough, Paul Blackburn, and Ryan Weathers.\n\nWhile the Baltimore Orioles have been killing it this offseason, and with the Toronto Blue Jays making some big moves as well, the Yankees look ridiculous with how inactive they’ve been. The Boston Red Sox were more or less quiet for awhile, but even their offseason has been miles better than New York’s, especially now that they’ve added Ranger Suárez.\n\nBleacher Report’s Zachary D. Rymer recently wrote an article talking about the MLB teams who have had the worst offseason, and the Yankees were at the top of his list.\n\n“(The Yankees) seem to be treating their offseason shopping as an optional exercise,” Rymer wrote on Wednesday. “Even bringing back Cody Bellinger, which should be a lay-up, is proving difficult.\n\n… These are the Yankees we’re talking about. No move is supposed to be too big, so no fan should be forgiving of how they’ve made only small moves so far.”\n\n“The Yankees actually project as the fourth-best team in MLB this year, but those projections are taking a lot on faith with question marks like Anthony Volpe, Austin Wells and even Giancarlo Stanton,” Rymer continued. “In other words, the last thing the Yankees should be thinking is that they can leave good enough alone.”\n\nTwo AL East Teams Reportedly Still In On Framber Valdez",

    "fullText": "When the New York Mets signed Bo Bichette on Friday to a three-year, $126 million deal, many MLB fans (particularly those rooting for the New York Yankees) assumed that the Mets halt their pursuit of Cody Bellinger.\n\nThat’s not what’s happening, according to New York Mets On SI’s Pat Ragazzo.\n\n“The Mets are still in play for free agent first baseman/outfielder Cody Bellinger, as sources told Mets On SI on Friday,” Ragazzo wrote.\n\n“The versatile Bellinger fits the Mets at multiple positions given his above average defense at first base and in center and left field. Bellinger’s left-handed bat would also provide added protection in the Mets’ lineup for Francisco Lindor, Juan Soto and Bichette. Bellinger also has a .929 career OPS at Citi Field in 20 games.”\n\n“The Mets could plug Bellinger in center or left field, or at first base if they aren’t comfortable playing Jorge Polanco and Brett Baty at the position,” Ragazzo added.\n\nBellinger has carved out a dynamic nine-year MLB career marked by peaks and valleys. Debuting with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2017, he earned Rookie of the Year honors with 39 home runs. His 2019 MVP season saw him smash 47 homers while batting .305, followed by a 2020 World Series title. Injuries hampered him in 2021-22, leading to a non-tender and a rebound with the Chicago Cubs in 2023 (.307 average, 26 homers). In 2024, he hit .266 with 18 long balls before opting out of his deal.\n\nBellinger’s 2025 campaign with the Yankees represented a strong resurgence, batting .272 with 29 home runs, 98 RBIs, and 13 stolen bases in 152 games. He posted an .813 OPS, 125 wRC+, and delivered memorable moments like a three-homer game against the Cubs, aiding the Yankees’ playoff push.\n\nBellinger remains a free agent, with ongoing talks stalled over contract length (he seeks seven years, while New York offers five at $155-160 million).\n\nBo Bichette Signing Creates Perfect Trade Fit For Red Sox",

    "fullText": "Denver Broncos assistant coach Jim Leonhard and longtime NFL assistant Wink Martindale were among eight candidates interviewed by the New York Jets for their vacant defensive coordinator position.\n\nThe Jets announced Friday they also completed interviews — all through video meetings — this week with Chris Harris, who served as New York's interim defensive coordinator after Steve Wilks was fired last month, Mathieu Araujo, Ephraim Banda, DeMarcus Covington, Daronte Jones and Jim O’Neil.\n\nJets coach Aaron Glenn will next shorten the list and meet with remaining candidates for in-person interviews.\n\nNew York's defense was one of the NFL's worst during a 3-14 season, Glenn's first as head coach. Wilks was fired after 14 games and Harris, the Jets' defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator, took over the play calling.\n\n“Compatibility is just as important as coachability,” Glenn said last week when asked about what he's looking for in a defensive coordinator. “So, I want to make sure we see things the same way and I want to make sure that we can vibe as far as sitting down and talking about how we see football.”\n\nLeonhard, a former safety who played for the Jets from 2009-11, has some familiarity with Glenn. In Leonhard's final season as a player in 2014 for Cleveland, Glenn served as the Browns' assistant defensive backs coach.\n\nLeonhard began his coaching career as an assistant at Wisconsin, his alma mater, in 2016 before becoming the Badgers' defensive coordinator and later the interim head coach in 2022. After one year at Illinois, Leonhard joined Sean Payton's staff in Denver as the defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator in 2024 before adding assistant head coach to his duties this season.\n\nMartindale was the defensive coordinator at Michigan the last two seasons after a two-year stint in the same role with the Giants. After several college stops to begin his coaching career, Martindale had NFL stints with the Raiders, Broncos and Ravens.\n\nAraujo spent the last four seasons with the Dolphins, first as an assistant defensive backs coach for Mike McDaniel and then as the cornerbacks coach.\n\nBanda coached the Browns’ safeties the last three seasons under Kevin Stefanski after several college stops, including Texas, Mississippi State, Miami and Utah State.\n\nCovington joined the Packers this season as their defensive line coach and run game coordinator after spending eight seasons with the Patriots, including last season as the defensive coordinator.\n\nJones has spent the last five seasons with the Vikings as the defensive backs coach and also served as the pass game coordinator the last three. He has also had NFL coaching stints with the Dolphins and Bengals.\n\nO’Neil has been with the Lions the past two years, including the 2024 season when Glenn was the defensive coordinator in Detroit. He's a defensive assistant who also coaches the Lions' safeties. He was a defensive quality control coach for the Jets in 2009 and their assistant defensive backs coach from 2010-12. O'Neil also has spent time with the Bills, Browns, 49ers and Raiders.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "The team behind Baby Steps discuss why they made a whiny, unprepared manbaby the protagonist – and how players have grown to love Nate as he struggles up a mountain\n\n“I don’t know why he is in a onesie and has a big ass,” shrugs game developer Gabe Cuzzillo. “Bennett just came in with that at some point.”\n\n“I thought it would be cute,” replies Bennett Foddy, who was formerly Cuzzillo’s professor at New York University’s Game Center and is now his collaborator. “Working on character design and animation brings you over to liking big butts. I could give you an enormous amount of evidence for this.”\n\nFoddy and Cuzzillo are talking about Nate, the impressively pathetic manbaby protagonist of their profound and ridiculous comedy game Baby Steps, developed together with Maxi Boch. When I was preparing to talk to them, I felt like I was about to meet my tormentors: I spent a week last year in the grip of this purposefully, transcendentally frustrating game about going on a horrible hiking holiday with the world’s most incompetent loser.\n\nBaby Steps’ premise seems like a cruel joke at first: watch the hapless man suffer! And you will suffer too! But the more I played it, the more meaning I found in it. As the hours passed and I helped Nate overcome his own uselessness and get himself up the mountain, I came around to him.\n\n“People coming around to him is common,” Foddy says. “We’ve had a lot of people say they hated him at the outset – and then they started either identifying with him or identifying him with other people in their lives. Some people end up sexualising him. The commonality between all these things is people coming around in some way, and that is the core philosophy of the game. It should be that it starts out feeling arduous and awkward and annoying and hostile, and then we try to bring you around to find pleasure in it … that happens to Nate in the story as well. He would never go outside for a hike.”\n\nNate is a large, bearded, russet-haired 35-year-old guy with glasses who lives in his parents’ basement. He is socially awkward, a shy urinator, whiny and massively averse to accepting help from anyone. Early in the game you come across another hiker who offers you a map of the mountain; a little mini-map pops up in the corner of the screen for a few seconds before Nate refuses it and it disappears. I guffawed at this. Like most of Baby Steps, it’s a joke about the comfortable, streamlined gaming experiences that we’ve become used to. But it’s also a joke about Nate, and the kind of guy he is.\n\nTalking to Cuzzillo threw me off at first because he is also the voice of Nate; he and Foddy improvised every line in the game. But he also has a deeper connection to the character. “Nate is one manifestation of my personality,” he says. “He’s an aspect of who I am. He’s not a made-up guy. I totally have refuse-the-map guy within me. That’s deep in who I am. If someone tries to help me, I run away screaming. Sometimes that’s a joyful part of who I am, and sometimes it isn’t.”\n\n“In video games you do this too – you immediately put it on the hardest setting and turn off the assists,” attests Foddy.\n\nLike (almost) all game characters, Nate was once a stickman with a block for a head and tissue boxes for feet. Foddy and Cuzzillo ran through nine or 10 prototypes before alighting on the concept for Baby Steps, prototypes that Cuzzillo describes as “very bad”. “We were looking for something with legs,” adds Foddy, straight-faced.\n\nFoddy’s games are full of ostensibly pointless suffering. It’s a theme of his work, alongside the idea of awkwardly moving a character’s body: a previous game of his, Getting Over It, has you trying to fling a guy in a cauldron up a hill with a sledgehammer. This prototype, in which you’d individually control a character’s feet to walk them around, fit that bill: within a couple of days the blockman had become a helicopter pilot, an off-the-shop placeholder asset. It was a couple more years before he became Nate, and six more before the game was finished.\n\n“The idea is that he’s not prepared and he’s out of shape,” says Cuzzillo. “Having an unprepared character gives the player an excuse if they’re feeling like they’re insufficient. They can blame him,” Foddy elaborates. “We had the idea of a cute lumberjacky guy with a little backpack, based on one of our friends, who will never need to know that he was the inspiration.”\n\nAnother of Foddy and Cuzzillo’s friends and colleagues was the source of Baby Steps’ name. They both now teach at NYU’s Game Center, whose chair emeritus Frank Lantz burst into their office with an idea for the name; at that point the main character was a giant baby (you could argue that he still is). Plenty of infantilising imagery remains, from rivers of breast milk to massive sandcastle toys to the gigantic woman who picks Nate up and cradles him in one especially surreal scene.\n\nAs they were playtesting the game with their friends, another aspect of Nate’s personality began to emerge: his misplaced pride. “This slightly obstinate vein of toxic masculine play starts coming out, from seeing some of our friends play it in a certain kind of way,” Foddy says. One of those friends, Julian Cordero (maker of Despelote), started looking very intently off the edge of cliffs after climbing them, inspiring a scene in which Nate’s fellow hiker Mike sits on the edge of a platform contemplating throwing himself all the way down again.\n\nBaby Steps’ interesting exploration of what masculinity means to a guy like Nate is delivered both through the story and the experience of play. You can unlock short, abstract, playable flashbacks to his childhood and the humiliating experiences that have shaped him. There are also somewhat less subtle symbols around, such as the omnipresent phallic imagery. An interesting thing about this game’s meditations on masculinity is that it doesn’t involve women at all: at a time when men’s insecurities are continually being lumped on women and feminism by common-or-garden internet misogynists, this is refreshing. As Foddy says: “Men can have problems with masculinity just by themselves.”\n\nThere is one thing that Nate straightforwardly loves: fruit. Pieces of shiny fruit hang tantalisingly in almost-inaccessible places, tempting you to waste a chunk of your life trying to reach them. If you do, you are treated to a ludicrous close-up of Nate’s face as he noisily consumes it before screaming its name into the wind.\n\n“We needed something to put on top of stuff,” explains Cuzzillo, deadpan. And a selection of increasingly esoteric fruits was the obvious choice? He explains that rewarding the player would be antithetical to the game’s philosophy. “[So] what if it’s a reward for Nate? What if it’s something he loves, so you get to vicariously watch him get a reward? The day we came up with it, we recorded the first five vocal takes … It’s funniest when you’ve tried hardest for it, and what’s at the top is just him having this crazy fruit orgasm.”\n\nThe inspiration for the dumb camera angle – the wide-angle lens from the top of the forehead – was trainspotter Francis Bourgeois. “Something we both got into during Covid, when we were doing initial exploration on this game, is the vein of culture that emerges when people are critically bored,” explains Foddy. “The idea is that these fruit cutscenes are coming when the player is feeling as unhinged as Nate is when he’s enjoying the fruit.”\n\nThat is the joke that Baby Steps keeps coming back to: you might hate Nate, but also if you’re playing a game like this, then in some way you are Nate. After many, many hours on the mountain, out in the snow, you reach an ending when Nate finds a cabin owned by a donkey-man whom he’s sort of befriended on his journey. After a few false starts, he finally knocks on the door and asks to be let in from the cold. You can go for a walk after that concluding scene, but the game goes to great lengths to warn you that there’s no point. There’s nothing else out there.\n\nBaby Steps’ final joke is that it’s lying to you: there is a final cutscene at the top of the mountain. You can go find it if you want, if you’re just irredeemably that kind of person. But for me, the game’s true ending is Nate finally learning to ask for help. I was rather moved by it.\n\nAfter Cuzzillo finished his first commercial game, 2019’s Ape Out, he felt ambivalent about it. “I wasn’t sure whether it was worth it; whether, once I was at the top of the mountain, I really wished I had climbed it,” he says. But he’s feeling much better about Baby Steps in retrospect, and about Nate.\n\n“I understand it way more now after finishing it. I feel like I’m re-realising all the things the game is about… Nate is a microcosm of the whole game, where it’s both a piss-take and sincere at the same time. It’s not one or the other.”",

    "title": "After losing out on Kyle Tucker, Mets left trying to figure out how to save offseason of own doing",
    "description": "The Mets swung for Kyle Tucker, but the outfielder ultimately took the Dodgers' $240 million offer, and New York is now trying to figure out how to salvage their offseason.",
    "fullText": "Only a couple of hours after Steve Cohen tweeted that he was looking for signs of smoke, a Vatican-style reference to the Mets waiting for an answer from Kyle Tucker, the Los Angeles Dodgers stunned him and the entire baseball world by signing the slugger to a deal worth $60 million a year on Thursday night.\n\nSo it’s almost too easy yet…the question begs to be asked: does Cohen want this smoke?\n\nOr will he, like most other MLB teams now, hold his cards close to the vest and wait for the inevitable lockout and war over a salary cap that is coming after the 2026 season?\n\nIn short, the Mets probably thought they were raising the bar into rarefied air by offering Tucker, a very good hitter but hardly a superstar, $220 million over four years. And in some ways, they were. Only for the Dodgers to swat them aside almost dismissively.\n\nSuffice to say, Cohen did no further tweeting on Thursday night.\n\nAnd I’m not blaming him or the Mets for drawing a line at $55 million a year (their final offer) for Tucker, as absurd as that sounds.\n\nYet, getting outbid must still be embarrassing in a way to Cohen. He’s a man who’s accustomed to getting what he wants, after all, even if it means spending obscene amounts of money for art pieces to add to his renowned collection.\n\nAs the richest billionaire owner in baseball, Cohen was supposed to be the death of baseball, remember?\n\nYes, the irony here is that this is what most other owners in the sport feared when Cohen said at his very first press conference as owner of the Mets that he wanted to model his organization after the Dodgers, that he might use his billions to create a new Evil Empire in Queens.\n\nRemember, at the time, the Dodgers were indeed a model organization that consistently drafted and developed home-grown talent in a way that allowed them to challenge for a championship every year without blowing the roof off the payroll.\n\nNow it’s different, of course. Helped in large part by the Shohei Ohtani connection that has attracted other Japanese stars and his willingness to defer hundreds of millions of dollars on his $700-million contract, the Dodgers are now outspending the rest of baseball in a manner that may have made even the famously impulsive George Steinbrenner look like a piker were he still alive today.\n\nEvil Empire? More like King Kong at this point.\n\nStill, Cohen has the money if he wants to compete with the big, bad Dodgers. And none of this is to excuse the Mets for what has been an underwhelming offseason.\n\nAs it is, it’s hard to tell if their sudden all-out pursuit of Tucker was part of their plan all along or more of a realization they desperately needed a big-splash move as Mets fans showed their displeasure with their wallets.\n\nDid they suddenly decide they better find someone to hit behind Juan Soto so he wouldn’t walk 150 times next season?\n\nWouldn’t it just have been easier to give Pete Alonso the $150 million over five years? He had made it clear he was willing to ease into the DH role, so I’ll never understand why the Mets drew such a hard line there.\n\nThey were willing to go three years but not five? It just never made sense, considering their need for a right-handed power hitter. And whatever their intentions at that time were regarding Tucker, they left themselves vulnerable one way or another.\n\nAnd now, even if they change course and throw crazy money at Cody Bellinger, well, sure, he’d make them better in a lot of ways, but he wouldn’t fill the huge hole in the lineup behind Soto.\n\nSo it’s hard to see how they’re going to have anything resembling a championship-caliber offense, whether they go after Bellinger or not.\n\nAnd if they were truly going all-in on run prevention, the David Stearns buzzword from the moment the 2025 season ended, why haven’t they made the expected moves to upgrade their pitching?\n\nDominant starting pitching and a lockdown bullpen would always offer hope of beating anyone, even the Dodgers, in a short series in October, yet the Mets haven’t gone that route either.\n\nAll along, I’ve said it wasn’t fair to judge Stearns until the offseason was over. And who knows, maybe now he’ll go out and trade for Freddy Peralta and sign Framber Valdez, and suddenly the Mets will have a starting rotation that can indeed beat anybody, especially if Nolan McLean blossoms into the ace everyone is now expecting.\n\nBut lest we forget, Edwin Diaz is now a Dodger, too. And while I’m laying some of that on Diaz for seemingly wanting to take the easy route to winning a championship ring, the Mets put themselves in a position to let it happen by not locking up their closer before LA ever got involved.\n\nIn truth, the most logical move at this point for Cohen might just be to hold onto his chips, save his money for Tarik Skubal next winter, or whenever the sport is open for business again, while seeing what McLean, Jonah Tong, Brandon Sproat, Carson Benge, Jett Williams and other top prospects look like by mid-summer as the trading deadline approaches.\n\nI’m not saying the Dodgers are unbeatable. The Blue Jays were one hanging slider away from beating them in the World Series.\n\nBut it’s hard to see how the Mets, without dramatic pitching upgrades at the very minimum, can realistically compete with LA for a championship in 2026.\n\nAnd right now that’s on Stearns. You can blame the Dodgers all you want for blowing up the sport and setting up a salary cap fight not only between owners and players, but owners and owners as well.\n\nYet the Mets shouldn’t be sitting here in mid-January trying to figure out how to save their offseason. If Stearns’ plan was to let the market come to him in search of the best value, which seems to be his M.O., well, it sure looks to be backfiring to the point where desperation is now part of the equation.\n\nDesperation and the LA Dodgers, that is.",

    "description": "The New York Giants EDGE room is talented, but how do they look moving into 2026?",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants had little to cheer about throughout 2025, but the edge positiohn provided a spark to the dank swamp that was the Giants’ season. Veteran pass rusher Brian Burns finished second in the NFL with 16.5 sacks, only behind the Browns’ Myles Garrett, who broke Michael Strahan’s single-season sack record with 23. Rookie, third-overall-pick, Abdul Carter finished the season strong, after showing resiliency and overcoming his own immaturity issues.\n\nNew York finished with 39 sacks in 2025, which ranked 17th in the NFL. They had 45 in 2024 (9th in NFL) and 34 in 2023 (29th in NFL). Overall, the edge room was the Giants’ strength, but they were not perfect either. Let’s review the 2025 season.\n\nBrian Burns, Abdul Carter, Kayvon Thibodeaux, Chauncey Golston, Tomon Fox, Victor Dimukeje\n\nThe Giants had three quality edge defenders in 2025: Brian Burns, Abdul Carter, and Kayvon Thibodeaux; those three accounted for 2,201 of the total 2,465 defensive snaps. Burns led the team with 863 snaps, and Carter had 844. Kayvon Thibodeaux sustained a shoulder injury in Week 10 against the Chicago Bears and eventually landed on the Injured Reserve; he played 494 snaps and finished with 32 pressures.\n\nThibodeaux’s presence and development were felt early in the season. He only had 2.5 sacks, but had a tackle for a loss in five of his first six games. Thibodeaux added 19 STOPs at the line of scrimmage, and he was robbed of a strip of Jalen Hurts on the infamous Tush Push play. His improvement as an overall football player was evident throughout the season, but it wasn’t consistent.\n\nFinishing plays was still an issue for Thibodeaux, as he missed nine tackles in 2025 (29%). Now, to be fair, some of these missed tackles are high-effort plays from the backside that alter the running back’s path, but the point remains — need more well-rounded consistency from the 25-year-old EDGE rusher.\n\nThibodeaux missed time in 2024 as well. He finished with 324 pass-rushing snaps in 2025 and just 358 in 2024, finishing with 32 and 38 pressures, respectively. Thibodeaux has improved as a player, and he’s a good football player, but he hasn’t displayed the top-five pedigree that many Giants’ fans thought they were receiving when Joe Schoen selected him as such in 2022. Still, he’s an asset and one the Giants must make a decision about now that he enters next season on his fifth-year option.\n\nBrian Burns is the heart and soul of the Giants’ roster. No player sets an example for others to emulate like Burns. He is a constant hustler who plays through nagging injuries, while being a necessary vocal leader that this defense desperately needs.\n\nBurns had a career year with 16.5 sacks to go along with his 53 pressures; he now has 114 pressures in two seasons with the Giants. Burns was also an asset as a run defender, accounting for 42 STOPs, which is tied for a career high for Burns (2024). Burns is everything a coach would want in a leader on the football team, and he sets an excellent example for Abdul Carter.\n\nAbdul Carter has recorded 66 pressures, the 8th-most in the NFL (most among rookies this season).\n\nA league-high 44 quick pressures (under 2.5 seconds time to pressure) and averaging a 2.41-second time to pressure, the quickest in the NFL among defenders with at least 200 pass…\n\n— Nick Falato (@nickfalato) January 5, 2026\n\nFew players in the NFL were as successful as ACarter at winning in a phone booth. Carter’s quickness and fluidity are rare even at the NFL level, which is why he led the league with 44 quick pressures. Offensive linemen who failed to time their punch or failed to make clean contact on Carter struggled to account for his speed and elusiveness as a pass-rusher.\n\nDoubts surrounding Carter grew louder when Mike Kafka held him accountable TWICE for missing team meetings. It seemed apparent that Brian Daboll was soft with Carter, and Kafka made an example of him against Green Bay by benching him for a series. Two weeks later, Kafka benched Carter for the entire quarter of a prime-time game against New England.\n\nTo Carter’s credit, he took the message to heart and finished the season strong, recording 22 pressures over the final four games, with interim defensive coordinator Charlie Bullen praising his approach to practice. Carter appeared to need a kick in the rear — a reality check — to push him toward his potential. The hope now is that the lesson sparked lasting maturity and sustained motivation, rather than a brief moment of realization, spawned by internet trolling and the overall embarrassment of being held accountable.\n\nEven with Carter’s issues, he still showed enough for me to be excited about his development. He must get better against the run. The strength is necessary for him to unlock a well-rounded approach to the game. He was also frequently out of position early in the season, but that seemed to be rectified down the stretch of the year. It was not a perfect rookie season, but his talents are undeniable — let’s see how he approaches the off-season.\n\nGolston only played 173 snaps due to foot and neck injuries that he dealt with at different parts of the season. The high point of Golston’s season was against Minnesota, where he had five STOPs at the line of scrimmage and was an asset against the run. We have not seen the best of Golston; he finished with five pressures and a sack. Dimukeje and Fox hardly saw the field; the former had one pressure and the latter two.\n\nThe Giants remain strong at EDGE going into next season, although questions about Kayvon Thibodeaux’s future with the team will likely be entertained throughout the off-season. Thibodeaux is entering his fifth-year option season and is a possible trade or extension candidate. Trading Thibodeaux would free up $14.8 million on the cap with no dead cap incurred.\n\nPersonally, I would love to extend Thibodeaux, and the Giants may get him at a slight discount, since he’s finished the last two seasons on the I.R. However, Thibodeaux may want to wait and see his options after next season, which puts the Giants in a position to explore the market, depending on their long-term interest in the 25-year-old.\n\nWith no off-season trades, a trio of Burns, Carter, and Thibodeaux is a lethal edge room for any defensive coordinator. Bullen was able to generate success and deceptive looks from the front with Burns and Carter at the end of the season, and Shane Bowen even helped Burns achieve a career-type of year. The defensive structure will be important, but the ingredients (the personnel) are an excellent baseline — let’s hope they find someone who can cook.\n\nI will say, though, the Giants could still use another edge defender, whether it’s a veteran signing or a day three pick. More depth at the position now that Dimukeje — who missed most of the season with injuries — and Fox are not under contract. Like many positions on the roster, the depth could be replenished, but the top-end of the edge room remains the most impressive on the roster.",

    "fullText": "And down the stretch they come.\n\nThe Giants have been in the market for a new coach since Brian Daboll was fired Nov. 10 and we could be approaching the finish line as their coaching search reaches its second week.\n\nContinue to check back throughout the Giants' process for updates, the latest news and rumors, and analysis. For our previous tracker, you can catch up here:\n\nNEW PODCAST EPISODE: Our Giants 'All In with Art Stapleton' show explores John Harbaugh candidacy, Ravens drama\n\nJohn Harbaugh is in the building.\n\nNow it’s up to the New York Giants to convince him to stay.\n\nHarbaugh is visiting the Giants on Wednesday, a source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to NorthJersey.com and The Record.\n\nThe Giants are throwing everything they can into the pursuit of Harbaugh to make him their next head coach. They'll deal with the fallout if there is any with the rest of their candidate list if he says no.\n\nThe Giants are clearly executing a multifaceted plan to convince Harbaugh to be the next NYG coach. There was a promise of more interactions to come, and the biggest is taking place Wednesday.\n\nNow the question is whether the Giants sell Harbaugh enough to close the deal before he leaves, potentially for a reported two more in-person visits he is expected to take with the Tennessee Titans and the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nRumors are swirling on social media regarding John Harbaugh's schedule. Here's what we know: the expectation is that the 63-year-old free agent coach will meet with the Giants and other potential suitors - reportedly the Falcons and the Titans - by the end of the week.\n\nDoes that mean Friday? Does that mean Sunday? It's not exactly clear.\n\nAnd while the anticipation is that Harbaugh would travel to those cities, it's still yet to be confirmed that he will be boots-on-the-ground inside 1925 Giants Drive - or anywhere else - on this interview circuit. The contingents could still travel and meet with the former Ravens coach.\n\nWe'll stay on top of all the news and nuggets throughout the day, so stick around.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: NY Giants coaching search tracker with news and candidate updates",

    "title": "I'm 7 months postgrad and still job hunting. I'm leaning on my hobbies to help overcome imposter syndrome.",
    "description": "I graduated from college and moved to New York City to apply for full-time jobs. I haven't found one yet, but I've learned to prioritize my hobbies.",
    "fullText": "Before graduating from Syracuse University last spring with a degree in journalism, it seemed like everyone (including me) was scrambling to make plans, get jobs, and figure out where to move.\n\nI always expected life after college would fall seamlessly into place, that all of my involvement in campus media, internships, and good grades would pay off immediately.\n\nSo, when I learned that my childhood friend was planning to move to New York City, it was the perfect opportunity to take the leap together. I'd always dreamed of moving there, and as the home of many big-name publications, it seemed like the right city to be in to kick-start my career.\n\nCome June, I'd moved, gotten a job at a coffee shop, and continued applying to every dream job under the sun (just like the hundreds of other LinkedIn applicants).\n\nLittle did I know, the barista position I'd only planned to have for a month or two would still be my lifeline seven months later.\n\nAt the beginning of my job search, I was incredibly motivated, but slowly, the rejections began to roll in.\n\nI started feeling like maybe I was the problem, that my experiences and skills weren't good enough. How was I supposed to gain more experience if no one would hire me?\n\nImposter syndrome hit me hard, especially since it seemed like the first question anyone wanted to ask me was, \"What do you do?\"\n\nAt first, I'd provide a whole spiel: I just graduated and am working as a barista while I look for a job in journalism, and interviews are going well. I always felt the need to make it appear as though I was on the brink of getting \"the job.\"\n\nThe catalyst for shifting my mindset came later, over dinner with a friend at our favorite Indian restaurant. We talked about life, relationships, New York work culture, and overall, what it means to unplug from the outside world for a second.\n\nMy friend shared his thoughts on being part of corporate America and said he doesn't base his worth on the job he has or his level of success. His words made me think about my own self-worth and why I'd been placing it all on my career and how qualified I am compared to others.\n\nNow, when I'm faced with the \"what do you do\" question, I say I'm a barista and freelancer looking for full-time work in journalism.\n\nI'm less concerned with explaining why I'm not working in corporate yet and more concerned with maintaining my peace and joy, as well as exploring my other interests.\n\nAlthough people's responses to my answers haven't changed much, my confidence in where I'm at and where I'm going has.\n\nAlthough this isn't the life I envisioned having after graduation, I'm grateful for the time I've had to explore my hobbies and be an active member of my community.\n\nAs an avid yogi and certified yoga teacher, I've enjoyed taking free yoga classes in Bryant Park. It's been a great way to get moving, plus it's given me a reason to stop with the endless job applications and catch up with some friends.\n\nIn my free time after barista shifts, I even parlayed my love of yoga into a three-month stint as a front desk receptionist at a studio in SoHo. In exchange for three hours of dedication a week, I got to take unlimited classes from some of the best yoga teachers I've ever had.\n\nAside from yoga, I also signed up with my roommate to volunteer within my Muslim community and teach religious education classes to kids.\n\nGrowing up, I loved attending these classes; it connected me to my culture and was also how my roommate and I met as kids. So, participating in this has felt like a full-circle moment that I likely wouldn't have had if I were already working full-time.\n\nHowever, despite finding a great community, I've found my feelings of imposter syndrome are still present — fueled by the overwhelming chaos and fast-paced energy of the city.\n\nOver the last few months, I've learned NYC isn't the best place for me — at least not right now.\n\nI always come home feeling like I haven't done enough, and it exhausts me. This is partially a result of my mindset, but I also think it's a direct consequence of living in a place known for its hustle.\n\nAlthough living here has been a great experience and played a huge role in helping me gain confidence, I'm ready for somewhere that's slower-paced.\n\nThere are, of course, still days when I struggle with my own self-talk and understanding my purpose, but I'm confident a move is the best next step for me as I continue working toward my goals and exploring all of the other things that make me who I am.\n\nMy time in the industry will come, and until then, I'll keep side-questing and doing everything I can to remain happy and present.",

    "description": "A NYC themed meme coin crashed shortly after launch this week, drawing swift outcry from the crypto community online.",
    "fullText": "Former New York City Mayor Eric Adams was a bullish proponent of crypto during his time in office, but an ill-fated meme coin debut this week has drawn outcry.\n\nOn January 12, Adams shared a post on his X account announcing the launch of NYC Token, a New York-themed token with no official ties to the city, but which creators said on the token's website would go toward \"critical initiatives.\" Adams said some proceeds would go toward fighting antisemitism and blockchain education for kids.\n\nAs it started trading, the coin quickly surged to a market cap of roughly $580 million before suddenly reversing course and plunging more than 80% in a few minutes.\n\nOutrage from the crypto community has been swift this week.\n\nThe episode drew accusations that investors had been victims of a \"rug pull,\" in which a token's major holders sell after an initial surge, leaving investors locked into their positions and unable to exit without losing money.\n\nWhile NYC Token rose slightly on its second day of trading, accusations that either Adams or the token's creators had \"rugged\" investors continued to swirl. Legal filings show that the company behind NYC Token, c18 digital LLC, was formed in Delaware two weeks ago.\n\nAn anonymous crypto influencer on X shared several posts saying liquidity had been pulled before NYC Token's plunge, with screenshots to illustrate, and users posted that they believed Adams had profited from the scheme.\n\n\"This has to be the fastest rug pull I've ever seen,\" said one user on X\n\nFor others, the sense of schadenfreude was strong as they watched meme coin investors caught in another high-profile collapse. The episode drew comparisons to Hawk Tuah coin, promoted by viral influencer Haliey Welch. The coin surged before losing 95% of its value shortly after its debut.\n\nA rug pull is usually defined as making a token effectively useless, which in memecoin land often means removing the liquidity needed for holders to sell,\" Haonan Li, founder of stablecoin merchant platform Codex, told Business Insider. That's what appears to have happened in Adam's case—the base layer of liquidity was pulled from the market.\"\n\nAdams could not be reached for comment. Representatives for the token's creators did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nCrypto data platform CoinGecko was still flagging the NYC Token as high risk on Wednesday. It posted the following disclaimer on the token's page:\n\n\"According to Rugcheck.xyz, there is a risk of market manipulation due to large concentration of tokens held in one or more unidentified wallets. Please use caution.\"",

    "fullText": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says he expects Republican President Donald Trump to try to interfere with the midterm elections, and he says raids by immigration agents in major cities are creating a sense of chaos that voters will reject in November.\n\nThe comments were part of a wide-ranging, 20-minute Associated Press telephone interview with the New York Democrat, who argued former Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola's entry into the Senate race gives his party a path to the majority.\n\nSchumer said that economic concerns have begun to cement in the minds of voters and that Democrats have plans to build their campaign around the costs, chaos and corruption they attribute to the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House has called such Democratic statements “fearmongering” to score political points.\n\nThis is an edited transcript of the interview.\n\nQ: Some are predicting Trump will try to prevent an open and fair midterm election and would be expected to dispute the results. Do you share those concerns?\n\nA: We share them, and we already have teams of both senators and lawyers looking at every way that Trump could try to screw things up, and we’re fighting against it. We already have a team to make sure that they count the votes fairly. And, remember, still, a lot of the election mechanisms are done by the states. And even in red states, there’s resistance to Trump interfering.\n\nTrump will do whatever it takes, and he has no honor and no credibility and no respect for law. But, we are prepared for it, and we believe we will succeed.\n\nInfluence of ICE raids on election\n\nQ: What impact do you think the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids are having on the midterms early on?\n\nA: People don’t like chaos. They see that cities and mayors who were perfectly calm and safe are now undergoing all of this chaos. And, you know, as I said, cost is number one. But it’s costs, corruption and chaos. The people don’t like it. And Trump, at the same time he's saying he wants to protect the protesters in Iran, he is going after protesters and other innocent civilians in Minneapolis. Makes no sense to people.\n\nQ: Does it seem to you like economic factors that are dissatisfying to a lot of the voting public are durable in this election year?\n\nA: Absolutely. The number one thing that bothers American families is they can't pay all the bills.\n\nThe costs is the number one issue. The cost of living, affordability, call it what you will. But it’s the number one issue, and now they realize that Trump is screwing them up on all of this.\n\nOn health care, with not extending the ACA tax credits, on energy, by getting rid of clean energy, wind and solar, raising their electric bills with tariffs, which is making the price of everything go up. So, people now realize that Trump is hurting them.\n\nWe are going to focus on five issues in terms of lowering people’s costs. They are health care, housing, tariffs — you know, costs of goods — food prices, because of food monopolies, and child care.\n\nTrump and the Republicans are in a bubble, and they don't understand it. They are ignoring it, and that's why things keep getting better and better for us.\n\nMidterm congressional environment\n\nQ: If we are looking at, in the House, 25 to 30 seats changing hands, is there a direct correlation to what can happen in the Senate?\n\nA: Look, at the beginning of (last) year, people said, “Well, there's a chance to win the House and no chance to win the Senate.” But because of the issues that I've talked about and because the House and Senate have been largely in sync on those issues and it's resonating with the American people how we're on their side, I think that the difference between the likelihood of winning the House and the likelihood of winning the Senate has greatly decreased.\n\nQ: Yet at this very moment, at the beginning of the midterm year, would you agree that Democrats have a narrow path back to the Senate majority?\n\nA: I say it is a much wider path than the skeptics think, and a much wider path than it was three months ago and certainly a year ago. And it keeps getting better and better, and we think we have a really good chance of winning back the Senate.\n\nYounger, non-white Trump voters\n\nQ: Younger and non-white voters drifted toward Trump in the last election, as you know. What is your plan, and what will it take for Democrats to win them over?\n\nA: The cost issue is really having an effect already. Look at the elections of 2025. Look at how (Democrat Abigail) Spanberger won by 15 points in Virginia and (Democrat Mikie) Sherrill won by 13 points (in 2025 governor's races). But it wasn't just those two states. We won elections in Georgia. We won elections across the country. And that is because voters, young and old, poor and middle class, don't think Trump was serving them well. So, there's been a whole turnaround about Trump.\n\nAnd in large part, we helped make it happen by focusing on costs.\n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.",

I'm told Harbaugh is encouraged that John Mara, who is battling cancer, plans to be in the office when he gets together with the Giants. Also, kind of cool that Eli reached out…\n\n— Gary Myers (@GaryMyersNY) January 14, 2026\n\nHarbaugh, who spent 18 seasons in Baltimore and won a Super Bowl, has emerged as a top target for general manager Joe Schoen, who has been described as “relentless” in his pursuit of the veteran coach.\n\nReports indicate the Giants are among Harbaugh’s preferred destinations alongside the Atlanta Falcons and Tennessee Titans, and the organization has remained in close contact ahead of the anticipated meeting.\n\nHarbaugh has been selective with interviews and may require personnel influence in any new role. The Giants could interview him in Baltimore if Harbaugh prefers to host candidates there, but early indications are the meeting will take place in East Rutherford.\n\nHarbaugh has already begun studying film on quarterback Jaxson Dart, signaling serious interest in the Giants’ roster.\n\nWith Schoen retained for 2026 and tasked with leading the search, the Giants are also considering other candidates but appear heavily focused on landing the experienced Harbaugh.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: John Harbaugh plans to meet with New York Giants by end of weekend",

    "fullText": "The New York high school boys basketball 2025-26 campaign is heating up around the Empire State as the drive towards the postseason officially begins.\n\nTaking back over the No. 1 spot in our latest New York high school boys basketball rankings are the \nArchbishop Stepinac Crusaders, which are off to a 9-4 start playing against some of the best competition in the country. Top two teams are both Crusaders, but who else should we watch for out of New York when it comes to the state’s top high school boys basketball teams?\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory.\n\nHere’s a way-too-early look at the top 25 teams in the country according to the Massey Ratings, which ranks teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule and margin of victory, as of Jan. 14.\n\nIf you take one look at the roster Archbishop Stepinac (9-4) and you’ll easily see why the Crusaders are near the head of the table in New York. This season, the Crusaders bring back a very senior-laden bunch and super talented in the front and back court. Senior four-star shooting guard Jasiah Jervis returns after averaging a team-high 16.2 points per game last season. The Crusaders will be tough to drive to the rim on as they have a pair of USC commits in 7-footers in Adonis and Darius Ratliff, respectively. Fordham commitment Hassan Koureissi pairs up with Jervis to create one of the best guard combos in the Northeast. This Saturday, Archbishop Stepanic will be taking on one of the top programs in the country in Notre Dame (Calif.).\n\nOne of New York’s top high school boys basketball teams is the Long Island Lutheran Crusaders (5-5) as they feature one of the best overall rosters in the country once again. Though the Crusaders dropped their fifth game of the season recently to CIA Bella Vista Prep, they have played elite competition thus far. What is obvious when taking a look at the talent pool the Crusaders possesses, this team can compete with practically anyone in the nation. Long Island Lutheran has multiple five-star talents in senior 6-foot-5 point guard Dylan Mingo and junior 6-foot-8 forward Moussa Kamissoko. Among other players folks need to have their eyes on that lace ’em up for the Crusaders are Cincinnati commitment Kayden Allen and North Texas pledge TJ Crumble. Long Island Lutheran will be facing Compass Prep (Ariz.) and Montverde Academy (Fla.) at the Hoophall Classic in Massachusetts.\n\nThe St. Francis Preparatory School Terriers (10-2) have continued with their winning ways as they return one of the more talented teams in the New York City region. Key players returning for the Terriers begins with Oesoemana Sacko, who is already committed to Fairfield University, and 6-foot-3 sophomore Justin DeSena.

    "fullText": "Jets predicted to trade for $212 million QB in lieu of Dante Moore originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAssuming that Fernando Mendoza is the No. 1 overall NFL Draft pick by the Las Vegas Raiders, the New York Jets will have to cross their fingers.\n\nDante Moore isn't a lock to come out of Oregon and enter the draft. He'd be the only clear QB2 in a class that isn't as strong as once thought.\n\nIf Moore stays in school, the Jets may have to pursue a different route at the quarterback position.\n\nBleacher Report's Alex Ballentine suggests an outside the box option: Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nTagovailoa has multiple years remaining on what was originally a $212 million contract with the Miami Dolphins. It'd be a fascinating intra-division trade.\n\nBecause it'd be a salary dump, the Jets in this projected trade actually also receive a second-round pick and cash while only giving up a fifth-round pick.\n\n\"For all of Tua Tagovailoa's faults, he is 44-32 as a starter,\" Ballentine writes. \"Tagovailoa said he would be open to a fresh start after a season in which he ended on the bench. The only problem is that he's only one year into his four-year extension. The Jets are uniquely positioned to help the Dolphins out. They have $93.7 million in cap space, which is plenty to take on a significant portion of Tagovailoa's contract before cutting it in 2027 with little additional cost. That would help the Jets win now while adding to their draft pick stockpile and showing some creativity in navigating their rebuild under Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey.\"\n\nMIKE TOMLIN NEWS: What it means for Rodgers | TV future | Tomlin trade potential | Cignetti?\n\nIt would certainly be fascinating to see the Jets' leadership group put their futures in the hands of Tagovailoa.\n\nIt's hard to know if Tua could be good enough without a talented receiving corps, but maybe he needs the change of scenery more than anything else.\n\nThe narratives would be great if this happened, for sure.\n\nPatriots, Drake Maye silence doubters with callback to Brady, Belichick\n\nA.J. Brown makes a disrespectful decision after season-ending loss\n\nIt's harder to become Steelers coach than it is to become Pope\n\nReddit proves Justin Herbert turns into Shedeur Sanders in the playoffs\n\nBills, Josh Allen never stopped pushing, and the Super Bowl dream is alive\n\nPanthers make decision on Bryce Young's future in Carolina",

    "description": "Taking a look at a Jets cornerback",
    "fullText": "Over the next few months, we’ll be taking an in-depth look at some of the late season signings who are under contract for 2026, and futures signings after the end of the season. We continue today with cornerback Samuel Womack, who signed a futures deal on the day after the season ended, having been elevated from the practice squad to start the season finale.\n\nThe 26-year old Womack is listed at 5’10” and 189 pounds and was a fifth round pick out of Toledo in 2022. He has started 11 games in his career so far, including eight with the Colts in 2024, and has racked up 73 tackles, 13 pass breakups and three interceptions in 46 career games.\n\nWomack was a productive receiver and cornerback in high school but wasn’t ranked by any of the main outlets so he had to walk on at Toledo. However, he saw action in seven games as a true freshman and recorded four tackles and an interception.\n\nHe continued to play a rotational role in 2018 but did make his first career start as he had 12 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss and a pass breakup in 13 games.\n\nOver the next three years, Womack moved into a starting role and was productive as he had 59 tackles, 15 pass breakups and two interceptions in 2019 followed by 20 tackles and eight pass breakups in just six games in 2020. He was then named as a first-team all-MAC selection in his final season in 2021 as he had 32 tackles, 18 passes defensed and two more interceptions.\n\nDespite not being invited to the scouting combine, Womack had a good pro day and was ultimately drafted by the 49ers in the fifth round.\n\nAs a rookie, Womack made one start and ended the season with 19 tackles, an interception and a forced fumble. However, his second season was disrupted by injuries and he had just seven tackles in seven games.\n\nHaving been released in final cuts by the 49ers after the 2024 preseason, he was claimed on waivers by the Colts and made a good impact with them as he had an excellent season. He started eight games and racked up 36 tackles, nine pass breakups and two interceptions.\n\nDespite this, he failed to make the roster in 2025 and ended up on the Titans for whom he made five appearances including one start. He had four tackles and a pass breakup. However, he was waived again in November and ended up on the Jets’ practice squad in December.\n\nWomack didn’t play until the season finale but was in on every snap and had seven tackles and a pass breakup in a solid performance and then signed a futures deal the next day.\n\nLet’s move onto some more in-depth analysis of what Womack brings to the table as a player, based on extensive research and film study.\n\nWomack has average size and length but posted some good numbers at his pro day where he ran a 4.40 in the 40-yard dash and managed a 36-inch vertical jump and solid agility numbers. His broad jump was below average and he did not participate in the bench press.\n\nWomack primarily played on the outside during his career, but he did see extensive action in the slot in a couple of games in his final season at Toledo and then got some work there with the 49ers in his rookie year both in preseason and the regular season. He also played there in preseason in 2024.\n\nWith the Colts and Titans, and with the Jets in the season finale, he played exclusively outside.\n\nWomack’s coverage numbers in college were excellent as he allowed a catch on less than half of his targets and never got beaten for more than four touchdowns in a season.\n\nAt the NFL level, he has given up nine touchdowns in his career, including six in 2024 alone. However, at some points during that season he was ranking among the league leaders in categories such as forced incompletion rate and snaps per reception allowed.\n\nHis balance, anticipation and movement skills are good and his film shows plenty of examples of being able to stay with his man.\n\nHis biggest issue seems to be inconsistent footwork, which can lead to him being beaten off the line.\n\nWhile he can run stride for stride with receivers on deep routes, he can struggle to recover when a bigger receiver gets a clean release off the line.\n\nWomack posted spectacular on-ball numbers in college. In fact, he is ranked 11th all-time in NCAA history for passes defensed despite only having three seasons (one of them pandemic-shortened) as a starter. He led the MAC three straight years in that category and twice placed in the top-four in the nation.\n\nHe showcased his timing and ability to disrupt on this play in the season finale, where he played the defender’s hands to perfection.\n\nIn terms of interceptions, which is of course something the Jets are desperate to add to their team, Womack had five in college and has three in regular season action at the NFL level. He also had two \n\nWhile run defense isn’t a major part of Womack’s game as an outside corner, it’s something he got better at over the course of his college career and it hasn’t proved to be a weakness for him at the pro level as some analysts anticipated.\n\nMissed tackles were another thing that some analysts thought might be an issue for Womack at the pro level, due to his average size and a perceived lack of play strength. This was despite the fact his tackle efficiency numbers in college weren’t too bad. Again, though, this hasn’t really been a problem in the pros, although he has had five missed tackles, all in 2024.\n\nHe had one forced fumble in his rookie season.\n\nAt times, Womack has used his hands well to jam at the line or redirect within five yards of the line of scrimmage, although this wasn’t really his primary role with the Colts or Titans.\n\nHe had 13 penalties during his college career with some analysts picking up on the fact that he would grab from time to time. However, he only has one defensive holding and one pass interference penalty at the pro level.\n\nAlthough he isn’t big, he is capable of making some aggressive tackles.\n\nWomack has hardly ever blitzed at the NFL level, although he did have a quarterback hit in a preseason game. He had this half-sack in college.\n\nWomack has had plenty of experience on all the main special teams units including as a vice on the punt return team and a gunner on punt coverage.\n\nHe wasn’t that productive in college, where he had as many penalties (three) as special teams tackles, but he has nine special teams tackles at the NFL level and made this impressive play at the goal line.\n\nHe did false start once on a punt though.\n\nWomack has displayed an ability to make quick reads and come up to make plays close to the line of scrimmage. In addition, he looks comfortable in terms of his assignment responsibilities in zone coverage.\n\nAs a former walk-on, Womack has displayed determination to get to this level and has been similarly defiant when released by the 49ers, Colts and Titans. He believes he deserves more of a chance to show what he can do and brings good energy and communication skills.\n\nOn-field discipline hasn’t been an issue with just three defensive penalties at the NFL level, although one was for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nWomack spent five weeks on injured reserve in 2023, then returned in November, after suffering an MCL sprain in his knee. Otherwise, he has only been affected by minor injuries and illness during his career so far.\n\nIt was surprising to see Womack unable to make the Colts roster this year after a strong 2024 season, but he reportedly really struggled in Lou Anarumo’s new system.\n\nThat scheme sees the Colts mix up their coverages and packages a lot more than in the past and Womack apparently struggled in camp with giving up catches and penalties.\n\nHe perhaps looked at his most confident when playing in the Colts’ zone heavy schemes but he has handled man and press assignments in the past so it may have been the multiple nature of the system that he struggled to get to grips with.\n\nHe was a teammate of current Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell with the Colts.\n\nWomack’s performance in the season finale stood out as a rare bright spot for the Jets that day, and going back over his career so far suggests that he has some ability and potential that could give him a realistic shot at a roster spot with the Jets next season.\n\nAaron Glenn has brought in a series of defensive backs that he says fits what the Jets do and Womack slotted right into the lineup and did a solid job which sets him up well to perform at training camp next season.\n\nOf course, we don’t know who the new defensive coordinator is going to be and, judging by what happened in Indianapolis, there’s a chance Womack might not fit in as well after this change is made. However, based on his talent alone, it’s too soon to write off Womack as a replacement level player and the Jets may have made a shrewd acquisition of an overlooked cornerback who could prove useful.",

    "description": "Two of the NFL's least successful teams are working with multiple first round picks in 2026. How could Cleveland and New York fix things?",
    "fullText": "For three quarters of the NFL, the 2026 offseason has begun. That means Super Bowl hopes and dreams have been replaced by scouting reports and salary cap debates.\n\nThat means, for 24 teams, it's draft season.\n\nThe 2026 NFL Draft is modest when it comes to quarterback talent but still loaded with players who can change the fortunes of a franchise. Pass rushers, wideouts, cornerbacks and reinforcements on both sides of the trenches are waiting to hear their names called in April. Let's see who fits where and make some educated guesses.\n\nPlease note this draft was completed before Monday night's Wild Card game between the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers, so draft position among the top 24 picks was determined using the betting spread of that game (a projected three-point Texans win).\n\nGeno Smith can be kept for about $8 million more than his dead cap number. While he might be a useful veteran mentor, he's also the guy who flipped off his home fans in his first year in Las Vegas, so... Aidan O'Connell will probably be the experienced (well, kinda) hand that turns things over to a polished rookie next August.\n\nMendoza's elite downfield accuracy means he'll dazzle when it comes to advanced stats like completion percentage over expected (CPOE). He balances pinpoint throws with strong, quick decision making and enough athleticism to keep defenses wary of his run game. While he lacks elite physical traits, you can't argue with his outcomes. Las Vegas needs a winner -- ideally immediately given how quickly it's cycled through head coaches. Mendoza has been wrecking shop at INDIANA.\n\nMoore has more physical tools in his box than Mendoza, but he's not as polished as the Heisman Trophy winner. Still, it's not difficult to see how a quick release and the arm strength to whip a deep shot through a rapidly closing window make him a tantalizing NFL prospect.\n\nThe Oregon star can break down under pressure and will need some time to acclimate to the NFL. Picking up a wideout with the pick acquired from the Colts in the Sauce Gardner trade (or, later on, the second round acquired from the Cowboys in the Quinnen Williams trade) could find him some badly needed receiving help to ease his transition.\n\nJosh Sweat was one of the few bright spots in Arizona last fall, racking up a career-high 12 sacks in his first season with the club. Only one other Cardinal had more than two, and that was 39-year-old Calais Campbell.\n\nArizona needs help just about everywhere but tight end. Reese's versatility can help him plug holes in a few places along the defense but most notably as a pass rusher. He had 10 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks in his All-American 2025.\n\nTexas Tech stud David Bailey is worth a look here, but Bain's playoff performance is too fresh to ignore. The 6-foot-3, 275 pound edge rushing monster had 5.5 tackles for loss and four sacks in the Hurricanes' first two CFP games, setting the stage for a push even further up draft boards.\n\nHis get-off and closing speed hit like a series of small explosions, making him an absolute nightmare to block and a haunting presence to escape. The Titans badly need an influx of talent; Bain may be the best raw prospect of 2026.\n\nTate's ability to create space with savvy route running, strong hands and upper crust ball tracking would be a rising tide for New York's cache of young skill players. Malik Nabers' double-teams would drop. Cam Skattebo (and Tyrone Tracy, if he ever re-enters the circle of trust) would face fewer stacked boxes.\n\nAnd Jaxson Dart, importantly, would have more options downfield that don't require him to lower his shoulder and run face-first into the concussion protocol (he probably still will. He just won't *have* to). Wideout isn't the team's biggest need, but it could be the catalyst that revives an inefficient offense.\n\nThe Browns allowed pressure on a league-high 46.5 percent of their dropbacks -- four percent higher than the second-worst Chargers, who were missing their starting tackles most of the season. Four different linemen who played at least 69 percent of the team's snaps are set for free agency. Spending room is sparse, in large part thanks to Deshaun Watson, formerly accused of more than 20 counts of sexual misconduct and what the NFL described as \"predatory behavior,\" and his albatross contract.\n\nThe easiest fix is to find a dynamic starter on a rookie deal. Here, Cleveland has its choice. Fano gets the nod thanks to his absurd power and athleticism at 6-foot-6 and 305 pounds. That athleticism boosts his recovery when beaten, which will be an asset when squaring up with rookie mistakes and elite edge rushers.\n\nTerry McLaurin is locked in, but Jayden Daniels' targets get iffy after that. Deebo Samuel is a pending free agent. So is Zach Ertz, who is coming off a season-ending ACL tear. Daniels badly needs a boost after backsliding in 2025 due to injury and lackluster play.\n\nTyson is a jetpack. The Arizona State star is good at just about everything, but shines hardest when it comes to breaking off cornerbacks at the top of his route and creating the space for clutch pickups. Sticky hands and elite recognition make him a dynamic closer on 50/50 balls as well -- though he could stand to bulk up a bit to withstand the rigors of a 17-game season.\n\nNeeds: CB, IOL, EDGE, LB, RB, WR\n\nNew Orleans could have used Tate or Tyson. Taking a player like Makai Lemon or Denzel Boston could be a bit of a reach here. Good news! The Saints also need help at another position that would boost Tyler Shough after a promising rookie season.\n\nEnter Love, who'd be a boon to a tailback rotation that got below-average returns from Alvin Kamara and Devin Neal last fall. His value as a runner (nearly seven yards per carry the last two seasons) and receiver (280 yards, three touchdowns in 12 games this fall) give New Orleans a dynamic replacement for Kamara and rising tide to the offense, albeit at considerable expense for a running back.\n\nReleasing Jawaan Taylor could save up to $20 million in salary cap space for 2026. Jaylon Moore hasn't been great and is only under contract through 2026. Josh Simmons was uneven and injured as a rookie, though his ceiling is massive. After Patrick Mahomes faced pressure on at least 42 percent of his dropbacks in his final two games of his 2025 (two games that washed Kansas City out of the postseason race), the Chiefs reload to keep their star QB comfortable.\n\nMauigoa is a rampart in pass protection, but he's truly devastating in space where his 315-pound frame flies upfield to demolish poor, poor linebackers. He's in the running with Fano to be the first tackle off the board in 2026.\n\nTrey Hendrickson won't be coming back, leaving the league's 25th-ranked pass rush in dire need. Maybe 2025 first round pick Shemar Stewart will get there, but he was always a project whose growth was further stunted by a truly pointless contract standoff last season.\n\nBailey brings proven production that Stewart did not, racking up a Big 12-leading 19.5 tackles for loss and an FBS-leading 14.5 sacks after departing Stanford for a hefty payday at Texas Tech. His explosive get-off and devastating closing speed means he can man the second level, but at 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds he's not so small he can't handle edge duties in Ohio (Joseph Ossai, for example, only has an inch and about 15 pounds on him). He's not a perfect fit, but Cincinnati gets a chance to course correct by taking an NFL-ready pass rusher in the first round.\n\nIn theory, Miami's next coach could use this pick to pump up his offense with another athletic marvel and make tight end Kenyon Sadiq a Dolphin. But whomever succeeds Mike McDaniel badly needs to address the league's 25th-ranked defense. And, lo and behold, Miami has a need at safety and Downs has slid out of the top 10.\n\nDowns can play deep or near the line of scrimmage and line up tracking slot receivers with ease. His NFL ceiling is \"Brian Branch, but better.\" He's a fixer, plain and simple, in a Miami defense in need of playmakers.\n\nDoes Jerry Jones truly want to shore up his run defense? If so, Clemson's Peter Woods could be the call here. Is he in the market for a Trevon Diggs replacement? There's Mansoor Delane and Jermod McCoy, among others. But the combination of need and cost savings at a high cost position instead shift the focus to Faulk, a high potential pass rusher who could lift a team that went from a top-four pressure rate with Micah Parsons in the lineup to the middle of the NFL pack without him.\n\nFaulk brings proven production (seven sacks in 2024 before this fall's down year) and the size Cincinnati covets up front (6-foot-6, 285 pounds). He's not a one-dimensional edge rusher, either; he has legitimate chops on the ground for a defense that ranked 29th in rushing EPA allowed in 2025.\n\nThe Rams only have three pending free agents who played more than 50 percent of the teams snaps on offense or defense. All three are defensive backs, including Cobie Durant. Darious Williams is 32 years old. 2026 presents a wonderful opportunity for LA to take the draft's first cornerback.\n\nEnter Delane, who led the SEC with 11 pass breakups and hauled in a pair of interceptions in 11 games. He can be trusted in single coverage on the sideline, with fluid hips and turn-and-go speed to keep up with NFL deep threats. His trustworthiness on an island could mean more blitzes for the Rams -- and an even scarier defense.\n\nThis is a pick that may hinge on Baltimore's next head coach. But this is a franchise with a definite identity. Landing a hoss like Woods who can set a bruising tone up front would help the Ravens get back to it.\n\nWoods, a 315-pound fairy tale monster with absurd quickness and athleticism, is set to jump up draft boards at the 2026 Scouting Combine. He lands in the top half of the draft here, pairing with Justin Madubuike to give Baltimore some world-class BEEF in the middle of its line and make life easier for the defenders behind them.\n\nLavonte David cannot possibly keep doing this forever. Please welcome his replacement, a taller, faster version of Lavonte David.\n\nStyles is a former safety who plays like it (complimentary), using elite athleticism to create problems at every level. He has the speed to turn and run with slot receivers and the physicality to meet a running back at the line of scrimmage and leave him with nothing but regret.\n\nWith Moore on board, several options to punch up his receiving corps persist. But while solid wideouts will last into Day 2, there may only be one chance to draft 2026's top tight end. With apologies to Denzel Boston and Makai Lemon, Sadiq is the pick.\n\nThe Oregon tight end is an athletic marvel and solid blocker who can seal off running lanes or get out in space to deflect defensive backs. More importantly, he's got excellent speed up the seam and quick change-of-direction skills to snap off linebackers and slot corners. Pair that with solid hands and, baby, you've got a stew going.\n\nDetroit needs a pass rusher big enough to hold down the edge and the intelligence to react and adjust as plays unfold. The 6-foot-3, 265 pound Parker qualifies as a valuable counterweight to Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nThough his numbers tailed off after last year's absurd 19.5-TFL, 11-sack campaign, he remains a versatile piece with a high ceiling and useful floor. He's violent at the point of attack, using a quick punch and active hands to shed blockers, though he's fast enough to win with speed on the edge as well.\n\nByron Murphy and Isaiah Rodgers played well in 2025, but there's no such thing as too many talented quarterbacks in a defense as aggressive as Brian Flores'. Adding McCoy would create space to shift Rodgers to the slot, adding strength over the middle alongside a young player who can be trusted on the boundary.\n\nMcCoy's torn ACL kept him from shining in 2025, but his four-interception 2024 proved he's a shadow in coverage, rarely allowing space thanks to fluid hips, elite quickness and vital recognition skills. He's an asset in man coverage from the line of scrimmage, and erasing quick-outs is a specialty -- something that would be a boon for the Vikings' pressure in the pocket.\n\nThe Panthers are running out of time to decide whether Bryce Young can be their franchise quarterback. After Tetairoa McMillan and Jalen Coker made up 81 percent of their receiving output in a Wild Card loss to the Rams, it's clear Carolina could use help to maximize its young passer.\n\nLemon's size at 5-foot-10 is a concern, but putting him in a lineup across from 6-foot-4 McMillan and 6-foot-3 Coker alleviates that. More importantly, he gives the team another man coverage beater with elite acceleration and quickness who can thrive in the short/intermediate zone in the space McMillan creates.\n\nOhio State's Kayden McDonald could be an answer up front with Kenny Clark on the wrong side of 30. But cornerback is a more pressing need and a top-three prospect has slid into Dallas' range.\n\nNot a single defensive back in the Cowboys locker room finished 2025 with a passer rating under 99 when targeted. Terrell, with 22 breakups the last two seasons (and eight! forced! fumbles!) would be rain to that desert. With elite acceleration and lateral movement, he's difficult to shake -- even if he's a bit smaller than Jerry Jones might prefer at under six feet tall.\n\nSure, a quarterback would be nice here -- but Ty Simpson here feels destined to end up like Kenny Pickett before him. It could be a wideout, but with Lemon off the board Pittsburgh may opt to play into tradition and coach up a receiver selected on Day 2 instead. Thus, we get Banks, a massive lineman who can play multiple roles but, most importantly, can succeed Cameron Heyward and pair with Derrick Harmon and Keeanu Benton to give the Steelers' a terrifying young defensive front.\n\nBanks has to refine his game, but his raw talent would make him a tantalizing lump of clay for a franchise that's expertly molded defensive talent. He's explosive at the snap and elusive laterally, allowing him to shed blocks and contribute all three downs. While injury limited him to three games this season and dented his draft stock, he may be due for a pre-draft rise this spring.\n\nZion Johnson has been frustrating in his time as a Charger and headed to free agency. Jim Harbaugh can pluck a Big Ten star to replace him months after the Patriots ended his season by brutalizing poor Justin Herbert.\n\nIoane, Iowa's Gennings Dunker or Oregon's Emmanuel Pregnon could be the call here, but let's start with the Nittany Lion. He's a brick wall at 330 pounds and has the quickness and aggression to create space at the second level -- something Jim Harbaugh will absolutely love as he establishes the run.\n\nThe Eagles haven't been shy about taking a legendary offensive lineman's replacement early in the draft while he's still on the roster. Cam Jurgens was drafted in 2022 to take over for Jason Kelce. Now comes Lomu ahead of whatever Lane Johnson decides comes next.\n\nPhiladelphia's pressure rate allowed actually decreased between 2024 and 2025, but all was not well across an offensive front whose struggles tied into an overall regression this fall. Lomu is a high level athlete who adjusted to Big 12 play with aplomb, showcasing All-Pro upside for the right head coach. Given the Eagles' success with homegrown and retread blockers in the past, his upside is too much to pass up.\n\nWith a blocking upgrade secured in the top 10, the Browns take the next step to elevate whichever poor, unfortunate soul has to play quarterback next season. It's too early to write off Jerry Jeudy even after his disastrous 2025. Instead, he gets a little help -- and another big body alongside Harold Fannin Jr. to serve as a playmaking threat.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Boston is a bail out machine on jump balls, but his biggest strength comes breaking off defenders in the mid-range. That would make him kind of a super-sized Kayshon Boutte. We've seen how nicely Drake Maye has leaned on Boutte en route to an All-Pro second season, correct?\n\nThe draft board has been kind to the Bears -- even at No. 25 they have a wide array of top-level prospects to choose from at positions of need. Secondary and offensive line help is waiting, but Howell's value for the league's 27th-ranked pass rush is massive.\n\nHowell led the SEC with 11 sacks. While he doesn't have an enormous frame at 6-foot-2 and 250 pounds, his versatile pass rushing attack makes him an asset even in Chicago's 4-3 alignment. His ability to use his speed to create leverage and then toss off blockers suggests he could help fix what ails the Bears.\n\nBuffalo could fall in love with a wideout here, but there will be time to address the position on Day 2. Finding a young stud who can keep the middle of the line chugging forward with both Connor McGovern and David Edwards headed to free agency, however, is a tougher call. Dunker could step in immediately to pair with O'Cyrus Torrence as a road-grading young duo at guard.\n\nThe Iowa tackle will likely kick inside due to his arm length but can hold his own on the edge if needed. More importantly, he's mean as hell, quick at the point of attack and difficult to move backward. So, pretty standard Hawkeye stuff.\n\nTrent Williams has to retire someday. We saw how lost the Niners looked without him in stretches in 2025. The Niners' postseason success has prevented them from at least a couple potential saviors earlier in round one, but they still get a good one here. Proctor is enormous; 6-foot-7 and more than 360 pounds.\n\nHe's got the strength to match that frame, but his athleticism belongs to a much smaller man -- including a 32-inch vertical leap despite being the same weight as a Smart car. He's solid as a shadow, and while pad level and lateral quickness will always be a concern with a player his size he should make an immediate impact if Williams doesn't return for 2026.\n\nAh crap, we let the Texans get another elite defensive prospect. McDonald is an anchor up front, damn near impossible to move at 326 pounds. But he's also blessed with an explosive opening salvo that fires him into gaps and shrinks pocket space from the inside-out. Now he gets to pair up with Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter.\n\nCould this be a spot for Alabama's Ty Simpson to serve as Matthew Stafford's apprentice? It's possible, but Allen's availability and the need to add dynamic, young athletic talent to the middle of the field makes the Georgia linebacker the pick.\n\nAllen can handle pass rushing duties as well as lock down the middle of the field in coverage or against the run. He's not huge at 6-foot-1 and 235 pounds, but he moves quickly and fluidity, rarely crossing himself up and sticking to receivers in coverage. He's also a bonafide thumper who can move Omar Speights into pending free agent Troy Reeder's role as a rotational presence.\n\nNew England's pass rush was a strength in its Wild Card win over the Chargers, but K'Lavon Chaisson is a free agent and Harold Landry turns 30 this summer. Reloading here would help create positional savings that will be vital once Drake Maye signs a record-setting contract extension.\n\nUiagalelei can break into the lineup as a pass rushing specialist while fleshing out his game. He's an athletic marvel who looks the part of an NFL star but still needs to refine his game. But with power and speed in droves, he'd bring a stable floor to a position of need for Mike Vrabel.\n\nCisse's turn-and-run ability and elite acceleration suggest he's going to be an absolute darling at the combine. That raw athletic ability is backed by an inconsistent approach -- his 78.9 passer rating in Columbia last season was solid but his 20-plus yards allowed per reception were not. Fortunately, he lands here with a head coach capable of extracting the very best from him.\n\nCisse occasionally plays over-excited, biting on double-moves and adding some boom-bust to his game. Mike Macdonald can fix that. If he can, there's a player with All-Pro potential waiting underneath.\n\nAlex Singleton is a pending free agent on the wrong side of 30. Denver needs a running mate next to Dre Greenlaw in the middle of the field. Hill can do that.\n\nThe Texas star is a smart linebacker who identifies plays and gets where he needs to be to stop them. His coverage continues to develop, but that's a weakness that the rest of the Broncos' defense can help cover as he develops it into a strength.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: NFL mock draft: Can Jets, Browns double-dips save their franchises?",

The plan at the time, according to sources, was to send 14 reporters and photographers to Tokyo to produce a separate daily color section, as it first did in 1984 when the games were held in Los Angeles. The Times will be covering next month’s Winter Games in Italy with one writer as Thuc Nhi Nguyen will be taking a break from the Lakers beat to cover the games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nWhen Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018, he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” Since the pandemic in 2020, however, the sports section has been reduced to the final four or five pages of the California section five days a week, with a standalone sports section of six to eight pages appearing only twice per week.\n\nDespite its statewide branding, the California Post's initial sports coverage will be centered squarely on Los Angeles, with a primary emphasis on the sports and teams the Los Angeles Times still covers in the Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA.\n\nHernandez and Harris will lead its MLB and Dodgers coverage, while Southern California News Group Lakers beat writer Khobi Price and longtime Lakers reporter Melissa Rohlin, who joined the Post last week, will anchor its NBA and Lakers coverage. Bonsignore will lead the NFL and Rams coverage while Bolch will lead college sports coverage, focusing on USC and UCLA.\n\nThe staffing losses at the Los Angeles Times come amid continued upheaval at the paper, which has faced newsroom cuts, buyouts and mounting uncertainty about its long-term investment in daily sports coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Post is not done hiring. Sources familiar with the startup’s plans say the outlet is continuing to pursue additional Times sports writers and other well-known local journalists before its launch on Jan. 26.",

    "fullText": "An arrest report revealed new details about a fight in the stands among fans at TD Garden during Saturday’s Boston Bruins-New York Rangers game that resulted in an arrest and hospitalization.\n\nAaron Tucker, 48, of Barre, Vermont, is slated to be arraigned on Friday on a charge of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and assault and battery on a person over the age of 60 in connection with the altercation.\n\nAccording to the arrest report, TD Garden detail officers responded to the arena’s Loge 2 section just after 3 p.m. for a report of an unconscious man who had fallen from the balcony level. After officers spoke with witnesses, they learned the victim was actually pushed while standing on the stairs in the section, causing him to fall backwards.\n\nWhen officers and security personnel located the 60-year-old victim, he was lying on the ground, semi-conscious, and breathing with his eyes slightly open near row AA in club section 113, the report stated. While enroute to Mass General Hospital for the treatment of a head injury, he allegedly told emergency officials that he drank “seven beers” and “had no memory” of the incident.\n\nOne witness told police that the victim was intoxicated and agitating Tucker and a woman he was sitting with, at one point raising his middle finger directly in their faces, according to the report. Another witness said Tucker and the victim continued to heckle each other before the push occurred.\n\n“He [witness] observed the victim continue to inch closer to the suspect and his wife, at which point the suspect grabbed the victim by the neck and pushed him, which caused him to fall backwards down the stairs,” police wrote in the report.\n\nNew video obtained by Boston 25 shows Boston police and EMS responding to the chaotic scene.\n\nTucker was wearing a Rangers hat and jersey, and the victim was harassing other Rangers fans leading up to the push, another witness told police. The victim’s friends had also been trying to get him to leave the arena to avoid continued escalation.\n\n“It shouldn’t happen,” a fan told Boston 25 News. “When the Rangers were here, they beat them 10 to 2; that’s when there are more fights.”\n\nOther witnesses reported seeing Tucker walk off toward the club level after the push as the victim rolled down “three to five” steps to the foyer below.\n\nInvestigators later spotted Tucker on surveillance video leaving the arena on Causeway Street and tracked him to the area of Endicott Street and Lafayette Avenue, where he was taken into custody without incident.\n\nTucker was booked at the Nashua Street Jail and later released on bail.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - New York City nurses walked out of 10 major private hospitals across the city on Monday ​to demand increased staffing, funding of health benefits and protection from workplace violence ‌often coming from patients.\n\nMayor Zohran Mamdani, who is just two weeks into his term, joined the picket lines to ‌support 15,000 nurses that the New York State Nurses Association said were on strike.\n\n\"They are not asking for a multi-million dollar salary. What they are asking is for their pensions to be safeguarded, to be protected in their own workplace, to receive the pay and the health benefits ⁠that they deserve,\" Mamdani told ‌reporters.\n\nMount Sinai said that the union's proposals would cost it $1.6 billion over three years, with a $638 million increase in nursing costs by the third ‍year, which is 74% more than current costs.\n\nNew York State Gov. Kathy Hochul had declared a disaster emergency last week, allowing out-of-state and foreign medical personnel to cover for striking staff. The disaster emergency ​is in effect until February 8.\n\nOn Monday morning, dozens of nurses spoke of lack of ‌healthcare benefits and inability to take adequate breaks during their shifts as they rallied outside a NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in uptown Manhattan. NewYork-Presbyterian is one of three healthcare networks affected by the strike along with Mount Sinai and Montefiore.\n\n\"In the operating room, I work as a night nurse and we're always short on staffing and this is unsafe for the patient,\" said Michael ⁠Lazar, a 53-year-old NewYork-Presbyterian nurse.\n\nMount Sinai said it ​had secured more than 1,000 qualified and specialized agency ​nurses to cover for striking medics and to deliver care for \"however long a strike may last.\"\n\nNewYork-Presbyterian said all of its hospitals were open and continued ‍to provide services.\n\nMontefiore did ⁠not immediately respond to a request for comment. A notice on its website said that services would not be impacted by the strike.\n\nThe union and the hospitals held ⁠the last round of the negotiations the day before the strike, according to Mount Sinai and NYSNA. As ‌of Monday evening, there was no information about the next talks.",

    "description": "The New York Yankees are apparently pursuing Kyle Tucker, but they just received some bad news in that department.",
    "fullText": "The New York Yankees have reportedly moved away from Cody Bellinger and have pivoted to other options in MLB free agency. One of those options? Kyle Tucker.\n\nTucker is the jewel of this year's free-agent class and was viewed as a potential fit for the Yankees heading into the winter, but it didn't appear that New York had much interest in the four-time All-Star.\n\nHowever, recent events may have changed things for the Bronx Bombers, as Bellinger seems to be asking for $36-37 million annually, a rather steep price for a merely good — not great — 30-year-old player with an injury history.\n\nAs a result, the Yankees have evidently decided to turn their attention to Tucker, who was said to be seeking a $400 million contract at the outset of he offseason, but may have reduced his demands as a result of a slow market.\n\nBut unfortunately, it does not appear that New York is one of the favorites to sign him.\n\nFormer MLB general manager Jim Duquette has revealed that the Toronto Blue Jays, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets are the three teams most connected to Tucker and have all met with the outfielder either in person or via video call.\n\nDuquette wondered if any one of those three ballclubs would \"increase\" their offers, indicating that each of those teams have already made overtures to Tucker.\n\nSo, where do the Yankees fit in all of this? Have they made Tucker an offer? Are they laying in the weeds? Are they really not that interested in the former Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs star?\n\nIt's also entirely possible that Alex Bregman's recent five-year, $175 million contract with the Cubs has rejuvenated Tucker's market and, therefore, his asking price, which may have caused the Yanks to bow out of the process.\n\nNew York has not made a single notable addition this winter. The Yankees are supposedly trying to make a trade for a starting pitcher, but things appear to be moving at a snail's pace on that front.\n\nAs far as signing big-name free agents? Outside of Bellinger, New York has not seemed serious about anyone. It was also linked to Bo Bichette, but it seems hard to imagine the Yanks meeting his asking price, especially considering how bad he is defensively.\n\nIf the Yankees really want Tucker, they better jump in now, because all three of the teams mentioned have deep pockets and are clearly not afraid to spend.",

    "fullText": "It was a fine frenzy in East Rutherford this past season, with the NFL slapping the New York Giants organization, coaches, and players with fines totalling nearly $500,000. That represents roughly 12.5% of the average yearly total across the league ($4 million).\n\nBut it all goes to a good cause:\n\nThe fines collected are donated to the Professional Athletes Foundation to support Legends in need and the NFL Foundation to further support the health, safety and wellness of athletes across all levels, including youth football and the communities that support the game.\n\nThe following data was accumulated through the NFL's operations department, compiled as part of their gameday accountability tracker. It does not include or account for any private appeals and their subsequent results.\n\nHere's a look at all fines levied against the Giants in 2025:\n\nOL James Hudson, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/kneeing): $12,172\n\nLB Brian Burns, unsportsmanlike conduct (taunting): $11,593\n\nGiants organization, violating concussion protocol: $200,000\n\nHC Brian Daboll, conduct detrimental to the league: $100,000\n\nRB Cam Skattebo, conduct detrimental to the league: $15,000\n\nS Tyler Nubin, unnecessary roughness (hip-drop tackle): $10,324\n\nRB Cam Skattebo, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/tripping/kneeing): $6,157\n\nRB Tyrone Tracy Jr., unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $5,731\n\nDT Rakeem Nunez-Roches, unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $23,186\n\nS Dane Belton, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/tripping/kneeing): $7,201\n\nLB Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles, unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $7,292\n\nTE Theo Johnson, unnecessary rough (late hit): $6,488\n\nCB Dru Phillips, unnecessary roughness (hit on defenseless player): $7,292\n\nCB Dru Phillips, unnecessary roughness (pulling player off a pile): $7,293\n\nDB Raheem Layne, unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet): $5,722\n\nS Tyler Nubin, unsportsmanlike conduct (illegal celebration and vulgar acts): $10,324\n\nCB Rico Payton, unnecessary roughness (late hit): $5,333\n\nCB Rico Payton, unnecessary roughness (striking/kicking/tripping/kneeing): $5,333\n\nCB Dru Phillips, unnecessary roughness (late hit): $7,293\n\nIndividual franchise/coach/player fines: 14\n\nPlayer fined most times: S Dane Belton (3)\n\nLargest fine: Giants organization ($200,000)\n\nPlayer with highest fine total: DT Rakeem Nunez-Roches ($23,186)\n\nPlayer with largest fine: DT Rakeem Nunez-Roches ($23,186)\n\nCumulative fine total: $453,734\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: New York Giants racked up nearly $500,000 in fines from NFL in 2025",

    "description": "Miles Guo was convicted of fraud. Now his formerly luxurious lifestyle is being broken down and sold for parts in bankruptcy court.",
    "fullText": "Miles Guo's home these days is a federal jail in Brooklyn. His life was once dizzyingly more fabulous.\n\nThe fraud-convicted one-time billionaire sailed on a gleaming superyacht, wore custom-tailored Brioni suits, and strode through his Gilded Age mansion on a million-dollar cushion of Chinese and Persian carpets.\n\nSince 2022, the cash, homes, luxury cars, and private jets of Guo's suptuous former life have been picked over by prosecutors, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a federal bankruptcy trustee — all trying to claw back money for thousands of creditors and victims in one of the most sprawling fraud cases in recent history.\n\nGuo — aka Ho Wan Kwok and Guo Wengui — lived so lavishly that the liquidation process has taken three years and counting.\n\nHere's a look at some of the priciest assets that, piece by extravagant piece, are being sold off as part of Guo's ongoing 2022 federal bankruptcy case.\n\nFederal prosecutors say Guo starred in Mandarin-language music videos and livestreams that enticed victims from around the world into investing $1.3 billion in his various anti-China and cryptocurrency schemes.\n\nMany of the videos show him in his 15-room Manhattan penthouse, gazing triumphantly at the city from either of two terraces overlooking Central Park.\n\nThe 7,000-square-foot home occupies the entirety of the 18th floor of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue, and is now being sold off as part of the bankruptcy.\n\nBrokers at Compass are asking $12 million — far less than the $67.5 million Guo paid for it in 2015, shortly upon his arrival from China on the heels of a corruption investigation there.\n\nIt was here that Guo was arrested by federal agents in 2023.\n\nConvicted in Manhattan of federal racketeering conspiracy in 2024, Guo's sentencing and a final ruling on forfeiture have been delayed five times, in part due to the complexity of his finances.\n\nGuo's Greenwich, Connecticut, mansion was sold for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate in 2024 for $7.2 million.\n\nThe 21-room, seven-bedroom home, which Guo bought for $4.6 million in 2020, borders the Stanwich Club golf course. Real estate listings feature tennis courts, an in-ground pool, a six-car garage, a billiards room, a gym, and a movie theater. Well-trimmed ivy climbs the stone and wood-shingled exterior.\n\nFederal prosecutors say the home featured bulletproof glass and that Guo employed round-the-clock security in the three years he lived there.\n\nLocated 25 miles from New York City in Mahwah, New Jersey, the historic Crocker-McMillin mansion is the last and most elaborate of the three addresses Guo purchased and then lost control of in the ongoing bankruptcy litigation.\n\nThe home's ceiling murals, elaborately carved railings, and other Gilded Age vestiges can be seen in real estate listings; brokers at Compass are asking $19 million.\n\nAccording to court filings and other online records, Guo bought the 21-bedroom estate for $26 million in 2022.\n\nHe was in the midst of spending another $18 million renovating and furnishing the Jacobean-styled home — built in 1907 by railroad heir George Crocker and modeled after England's Bramshill House — when he was arrested.\n\nGuo's plans included outfitting separate wings for his wife, his son, and his daughter. Federal prosecutors say he'd already purchased $978,000 in carpets, a $62,000, eight-foot-diameter Samsung television, and something his indictment called a $53,000 \"Louis XV-style gilt bronze fireplace log cradle.\"\n\nThe filings don't say if Guo intended to keep the mansion's floor-to-ceiling pipe organ, which likely came in handy during the seven decades the home was a Catholic seminary.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Guo's Cirrus SF50 Vision Jet — a seven-seater he'd purchased in 2019 — was sold back to Cirrus as part of the bankruptcy, for $3.5 million. A second private jet, a Bombardier Global XRS, netted some $12 million.\n\nThe estate has yet to sell Guo's third and last personal aircraft, a four-seat Cirrus SR22 single-engine propeller plane.\n\nGuo's ground-transportation options were also lavish, including a dozen top-end motorcycles and luxury cars, also being litigated for sale in the bankruptcy.\n\nA Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Roadster was seized by the feds from the six-car garage at the Connecticut mansion. And his videos still show him tooling around in his $3.5 million red Ferrari.\n\nThe most expensive of the cars is a $4.4 million custom Bugatti Chiron Super Sport.\n\nGuo's motor yacht, the Lady May, was the first big-ticket item to go on the auction block — in all her shimmering aluminum, white marble, and Macassar ebony glory.\n\nHe spent 41 million euros in fraud proceeds (worth $48 million today) to buy the vessel in 2018. The bankruptcy trustee recovered half that sum — $23 million — three summers ago, selling it, according to bankruptcy filings, to New England auto dealership magnate Herb Chambers.\n\nThe boat boasts five staterooms that can sleep 10 guests, including an owner's cabin with a spacious dressing room and his-and-hers en-suite bathrooms.\n\nGuo's pal and business partner, Steve Bannon, was infamously arrested on board in August 2020.\n\nYacht lovers who missed the 2023 bankruptcy sale have another chance to own it. Now refurbished, renamed \"Excellence V,\" and docked in Fort Lauderdale, the Lady May is listed for sale by yacht brokers Edmiston & Company for $29 million.\n\nGuo's videos, still online, show him stalking the yacht's bleached teak decks as he smokes cigars, raps in Mandarin about his wealth, and aims martial arts kicks at the camera.\n\nIn June, a hodge-podge of furniture, light fixtures, wall hangings, tableware, and knickknacks — 156 items, all from the Manhattan penthouse — were put on the virtual auction block in Connecticut.\n\nThe sale included an ornate mahogany chest of drawers that had been cryptically referred to in Guo's criminal file as \"A Louis XV Style French Ormolu-Mounted Mahogany Commode by Joseph Emmanuel Zweiner.\" \"Veneer damage\" and \"right and left side cracking,\" the auction listing read.\n\nA collection of six small ceramic figurines was listed together as \"Misc. Oriental Items\" and included a \"Damaged & Broken Pig.\" Even a \"Lot of (2) small trash cans\" was up for bidding.\n\nThe bankruptcy file sheds no light on the fate of the racks of hand-tailored Italian suits Guo spoke of while sitting in the library of his penthouse during a 2018 interview with the New York Post.\n\n\"I have 60 custom-made Brioni suits and handmade Louis Vuitton shoes,\" he told the tabloid, which said he added, \"I don't care about things. I'm a Buddhist.\"",

    "title": "I visited Nespresso's NYC flagship, with free coffee and a speakeasy. It showed me how brands want to be our identity.",
    "description": "The nearly 14,000 square-foot store offers free coffee and a place to hang out, but I probably won't be back.",
    "fullText": "At 4:45 pm on Wednesdays, I'm used to hearing my editors discuss the evening's stories. This week, I eavesdropped on a conversation about the similarities between a coffee pod and an oxidized avocado.\n\nI was visiting Nespresso's new flagship location in Manhattan's tourist-heavy Flatiron district, a well-lit, open-air space that feels almost like an Apple store. The Nestlé-owned coffee company opened the nearly 14,000 square-foot store in December, billing its now-largest retail space as \"a destination for modern coffee culture\" in a press release.\n\nPart of the store's big draw is the free coffee, and the self-service station features shiny machines and a wide array of pods. An extremely friendly employee approached me asking if I have a Nespresso — I don't — before explaining how the \"bright, citrusy\" Tanzania coffee pod compares to Velluto, which is like \"the house wine of coffee.\" She gave me instructions for using the machine, displaying the patience and helpful rhyming tips befitting a kindergarten teacher as I somehow fumbled with the two buttons.\n\nAfter having my double shot of Tanzania, which actually was quite bright and citrusy, I wandered over to the smelling station, where you can sniff 12 different brews. As I determined my favorite scent, I kept thinking about something that chef and restaurateur Jeremy Fall, the man behind this summer's viral Hamptons smoothie, told me a few months ago: \"The way people look at drinks is that they sort of say a lot about their identity.\"\n\nThe store also tries to make Nespresso part of customers' identity, with its push toward personalization and finding your signature blend. After helping me make coffee, the employee made sure to tell me that if I buy a glass cup, I can get it engraved with any personal message for free.\n\n\"If it's free, it's for me!\" she told me. The store emphasizes its free offerings, including a barista class and complimentary coffee, yet I couldn't shake my awareness that the whole point is to make me buy stuff. The walls are lined with mugs, nanofoamers, barista recipe makers, flavored syrups, Nespresso machines, pod holders, and even bag charms à la Labubu.\n\nYet there is also the genuine possibility of simply hanging out. Two employees let me know that the store's secret, hidden coffee speakeasy opened at 5 pm, tucked behind a painting on the lower level.\n\nI stepped inside around 5:15 pm, and a line had formed by 5:20 pm. The mocktail bar offered three drinks, and I went with \"The Hidden Fizz\" after the bartender said it was the most refreshing. The $15 drink was the only item I paid for during my visit.\n\nDespite the trappings of a speakeasy, the space didn't feel private, especially since multiple employees told me to visit. In the dim lighting and over an unidentifiable jazz song, people took pictures or chatted quietly.\n\nThough I generally avoid fruit-coffee combos, I liked the drink more than expected. I forced my coworkers, Henry and Ana, to meet me at the store and try it, too. Henry agreed that it was OK if a little too sweet, and didn't realize it had any coffee; Ana was \"literally obsessed.\"\n\nThere's also a lounge downstairs, with self-service coffee, couches, a chessboard, and a record player. When I walked in, an employee, dressed in the store's characteristic beige, stood at a counter reading \"How to Taste Coffee.\" Other books dotted the space, many of them focused on nature despite our being underground in New York City: multiple editions of \"Great Escapes,\" a photography collection featuring outdoor athletes, and a selection of works by the chronically outside painter Monet.\n\nMuch like Starbucks, it seems that the Nespresso flagship wants to be a third space, an informal social place beyond home or work. And to an extent, it accomplishes the goal — two guys at the chess table sat discussing H-1B visas, while two women huddled on a couch without even holding coffee cups.\n\nI don't see myself coming back, mainly because I'd prefer to spend my time in a smaller, local New York City café, but partly because of the not-so-subtle push to make me identify with, and identify myself by, the brand. Yet for those who don't mind that and can fight the impulse to buy Nespresso products, the store can serve as a rare spot to get a free coffee and sit on a plush sofa.",

    "fullText": "Hell fucking YES they dropped 10 on New York!\n\nEnjoy. After the Rangers scored their first goal…\n\n…The Boston Bruins put belt to ass for 60 straight minutes. 10-2 Bruins Win!\n\nYour TOI Leader was Charlie McAvoy, who had 21:26 logged last night.\n\nThe Bruins got to see what the New York Rangers are without their vaunted goaltender Igor Sheshterkin, and as it turns out, the New York Rangers suck out loud. The Bruins were allowed gorgeous opportunities to score all night, and with Sheshterkin out, the Rangers defense was effectively bullied all night, forcing a goalie change and a historic night in Boston.\n\nKhusnutdinov and Pavel Zacha had hat tricks tonight; as I’m sure you’ve read this is the first time since 1964 since the Bruins have ever had two players record double hatties on home ice.\n\nIn the middle of all this it can be easy to lose the guys who didn’t get hat tricks, but this was a phenomenal night for Fraser Minten, who got two goals, and Charlie McAvoy, who got his 2nd of the year. Good for both of them!\n\nDavid Pastrnak had the first 6 point game in almost 50 years for the Boston Bruins, joining Ken Hodge and Bobby Orr as the only players in team history to do such a thing. Just another moment on the pile for the legend. What a special player.\n\nI’m sure this game will produce some all-timer whining from JT Miller.\n\nJeremy Swayman, now properly rested and to be clear, was not doing nothing all game, had a pretty good finish; .931 SV% on 29 shots is nothing to sneeze at. Now, let’s make absolutely sure Korpi starts today. Okay?\n\nThe last time the Bruins scored 10 in a game was back in 1988, when they absolutely pasted the Blackhawks in a 10-3 contest. That game featured Cam Neely with a 7 point night, Craig Janney with a 3 assist night, Steve Kasper with two goals, and 5 other Bruins scoring in that contest. Tidy bit of work by the B’s tonight. Tidy bit indeed.\n\nThe Bruins continue things on today against the Pens! That game is at 5pm EST.",

    "fullText": "Friday's usual \"Ask The Maven\" was on holiday but  \"ATM\" is running today. This week's question comes from City Island, New York. Jack Gumpert asks:\n\nHOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HOW THE TV MEDIA IS HANDLING THE RANGERS SITUATION?\n\nThe Maven replies: You have to start with the fact that whether the Blueshirts win or lose, it's all there for the public to see on the screen, in person as well as all the replays available.\n\nThere can be no cheating the viewing public.\n\nMSG Networks' analyst styles vary. Sam Rosen and Joe Micheletti, for example, were more –  shall I say – temperate in their handling of a non-playoff team. They were professional and rational which were fair enough and the fans adored them.\n\nThe very able replacements, Kenny Albert and Dave Maloney, have brought their pungent-no-kidding-around radio styles superbly to television and – I'm certain – fans find it most refreshing.\n\nEmotional – in a fan kind of way – Maloney reacts more forcefully than Micheletti while Albert\n\ncontinues to be the best play-by-play man for which a Rangers fan can root. MSG Networks employs a variety of other analyst types and some penetraiting ones.\n\nI was intrigued with a post-game schmooze the other night between the very insightful John Gianonne and Steve Valiquette. It was very revealing in terms of Vally's comments about some of the Rangers. Take a look:\n\n\"Now is the time of year where you start sitting people,\" Valiquette asserted. \"You have to get everybody's attention. You start with Lafreniere; he's pacing for 16 goals. Terrible giveaway (late vs. Buffalo) again; getting less than 15 minutes of ice time right now. You have to get more from him.\n\n\"You need to get more from your top six and I think that it sends a message to everybody that they can be next. One of the biggest challenges NHL teams have is that guys make a lot of money and you can't shame or blame a millionaire. But you can embarrass them by taking away their ice time. That's the only thing you can control.\n\nRemembering Glenn Hall Against The Rangers I have to admit that The Maven has taken the passing of Hall of Fame goalie Glenn Hall hard. Tearful hard.\n\n\"You can control the narrative in your room if you do that. You can go there. Sometimes during a game, you miss a shift. Panarin not backchecking on the empty net goal should cost  PP time in the next game.\n\n\"You have a meeting with him (and say) 'Look, you didn't skate at the end of the game on the PP.'\"\n\nToday, we'll see who comes through and who doesn't and I expect that the MSG Networks' pros will tell us what we need to know!\n\nOh, yeah, by the way, they need two points!",

    "fullText": "Following the publication of a report in The New York Times on Friday night revealing that the Washington National Opera will be leaving the Kennedy Center, members of the Trump administration immediately began scrambling to reframe the news as not only a positive, but their idea.\n\nKennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi, who has been hard at work lashing out at artists for canceling scheduled performances at the once-revered venue, posted a statement to X claiming that the center’s relationship with the opera group has “presented ongoing financial challenges for well over a decade” that “long predate the current leadership.”\n\n“Given the longstanding financial strain, it has become necessary for us to part ways to protect the best interests of the Center,” Daravi wrote.\n\nThe statement was then amplified by the venue’s Donald Trump-appointed executive director Richard Grenell, who elaborated on the difficulties surrounding exclusivity agreements.\n\n“Having an exclusive relationship has been extremely expensive and limiting in choice and variety,” Grenell wrote on X. “We approached the Opera leadership last year with this idea and they began to be open to it.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, he wrote, “The exclusive Opera contract cost the Trump Kennedy Center $64 million over the last 10 years—with their expenses being double their revenues.”\n\n“We were very pleased that the current Opera leadership was so willing to end their exclusivity,” he noted.\n\nThe New York Times report states that the decision to sever ties was made by the Washington National Opera, with the board of trustees approving a resolution on Friday that will enable the group to terminate its agreement with the venue.\n\n“Today, the Washington National Opera announced its decision to seek an amicable early termination of its affiliation agreement with the Kennedy Center and resume operations as a fully independent nonprofit entity,” a statement provided to The New York Times said.\n\nOpera officials told the paper that new venues in Washington D.C. have been lined up but that no leases have been signed. They declined to name specific venues.\n\nWith the passing of the resolution, the WNO will now seek to move its performances out of the center’s opera house and reduce the number of performances staged there.\n\nThe decision marks the end of a partnership between the Kennedy Center and the WNO that dates back to 1971.\n\nWhile the WNO did not mention the Kennedy Center’s MAGA rebrand as the reason for its departure, they have noted disagreements with new requirements that have been made under the cultural center’s new management.\n\nSeveral well-known performers have canceled planned events since President Donald Trump’s takeover of the center, which saw him fire the board in order to populate it with his allies and install himself as chair.\n\nTrump further ignited tensions when he attempted to rebrand the center to bear his name, ignoring the fact that any formal change requires congressional action. A lawsuit was filed shortly after, challenging the rebrand.\n\nIn response to Trump’s actions, several artists have canceled planned appearances at the performing arts venue, including comedian Issa Rae, folk act Rhiannon Giddens, musician Kristy Lee, trumpeter Wayne Tucker, and Grammy-winning bluegrass performer Béla Fleck.\n\nOn Thursday, singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos canceled her Feb. 7 performance at the Kennedy Center, citing her Mexican heritage and the Trump administration’s immigration policies as the reasons behind her decision.\n\n“As an artist, I treasure the freedom to create and share my music, and for many years I have used this privilege to uplift the stories of immigrants in this country,” the Grammy-nominated musician wrote on Thursday. “Unfortunately, I do not feel that the current climate at this beloved venue represents a welcoming space for myself, my band, or our audience.”",

    "description": "Former New York Times writer Harvey Araton's novel reveals a raucous life of a youth athlete, and lessons we can all learn from it.",
    "fullText": "It’s a statement but also a question we can ask ourselves as sports parents.\n\nIt’s driven into our kids very early, often by us.\n\nOr is it to just enjoy the experience?\n\n“Dad, according to Mom, asked the parents in our group not to worry about how good we were, or weren’t,” writes author Harvey Araton, through the eyes of a kid named “Z,” in a new middle-grade novel.\n\nZ’s dad was the coach of the boy’s first soccer team. It’s a neighborhood collection of grade school buddies. Dad didn’t just roll out the ball, though. He orchestrated drills that mimicked game situations that gave everyone a shot at the action.\n\n“You scrimmage too much, and the same kids, the stronger players, will dominate the ball, and then how do the other kids get better?” Z overhears his dad telling his mom early in the book.\n\nEveryone notices, in fiction and reality, when others don’t have this growth mentality.\n\nZ and his teammates hear opposing parents scream for blood, or at least a foul, when his team, once a doormat, incrementally starts to get better and begins to dominate.\n\nThe kids of manic youth sports parents, one of whom Araton admits to once being himself, is whom he wants to reach. The veteran sportswriter, most recently with The New York Times for 25 years, covered the Danny Almonte age scandal at the 2001 Little League World Series, and the ensuing escalation of Little League World Series coverage into American living rooms.\n\nHe has pondered or written about (or both) kids choosing between club and high school soccer and early sports specialization.\n\nHe also played the role of sports dad to two now-grown sons (36 and 32).\n\n“Kids learn playing sports,” Araton tells USA TODAY Sports. “I think there's a joy in that. I just feel, especially at these early years, it's becoming infected with this ambition that there could be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and I think too many parents become obsessed with turning their children into potential cash machines.”\n\nAraton launched the book last week with a signing at his local bookstore in Montclair, New Jersey. He made sure to also include a panel discussion about youth sports. He spoke with us about how his novel imitates the raucous life America lives within it, and the lessons he has gleaned from it.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nAraton is from Staten Island, which he describes as New York City’s last developed borough. It still has large swaths of parks and fields, where his story is set.\n\nHe had grown up on the basketball courts near his public housing development. The free play felt natural as it took him to the local Jewish community center and high school. He eventually played at a health club in Brooklyn as an adult and even worked in Madison Square Garden, where he covered the Knicks, the team he had idolized as a kid.\n\nHis competitive juices carried him into fatherhood when his older son, Alex, was in first grade and had the option of going out for a travel team. It’s a decision many of us have faced.\n\n“I remember asking him if he wanted to try out,” Araton says. “And he was kind of a naturally cautious kid and said, ‘Not really,’ and I remember being disappointed, a little deflated. Maybe I already was thinking, ‘If he doesn't go into this next level, he'll fall behind and never catch up, (and) there will go any chance of playing in high school.’ I mean, I could look at my kids, look at their size even at that age and know that they weren't likely to be D1 college athletes.\n\n“But I remember being disappointed and over the next couple of weeks, I came up with five or six different ways to pose the same question. Well, Nick's trying out, you sure you don't want (to)? And he kept saying no. And then the last time that I asked, he said, ‘No, dad.’ And then he looked at me and said, ‘But if I don't play travel, can I still play in the town league?’\n\n“And I remember feeling this sensation of shame because I realized in that moment that I was projecting my own ambitions and my own sports values onto this 6-year-old kid. And all he wanted to do at that point in his life was just run around and play with a bunch of kids he knew and maybe take one or two things out of any game and feel good about himself and look forward to the snacks.”\n\nThe book’s central character, who tells the story in the first person, is a combination of Araton’s two sons. Charly, Alex’s younger brother, was 4-foot-11 when he entered high school but played on the basketball team for four years.\n\nZ is left-footed with really good field vision like Alex and he’s small and feisty like Charly was. It doesn’t seem to bother Z when his young team is losing because he knows he will celebrate the things they all did well, or at least enjoyed, at Big Mitch’s restaurant afterward.\n\nBig Mitch is the father of his friend and teammate, Lloyd.\n\n“You only let in, like, seven or eight goals on an undefeated travel team,” he tells Lloyd, the team’s goalie, in the book. “Do you think a kid who was out of shape could do that?”\n\nZ becomes less comfortable when sports becomes more and more competitive. His father has a horrific accident and the team eventually gets a coach from England, who adopts a similar skills-first mindset with the kids. Kevin, the coach, who has also had a traumatic experience with his father, takes Z under his wing.\n\nAs the boys and girls on the team continue to rise in competition level, and travel further and further away from Staten Island, Z gets a much more transactional coach.\n\nHe feels himself immersed in a world over which he has less and less control, similar to the experiences Araton observed and felt as a soccer dad.\n\n“The reason why I chose soccer is because I probably was most closely involved with that, whether it was as coaching them in the early grades or just being at the games and kind of like, living for it a little bit,” he says. “I understand why parents are so heavily involved. After a week of work you really look forward to the experience of the games. It's like an adrenaline rush but also I think, it created a whole social network with the parents of their teammates and friends and everything. So I get the temptation, and the seductiveness, of it all, but (it) all got completely out of control, as well.”\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nWhile Araton was growing up on Staten Island, the borough’s Mid-Island Little League won it all in Williamsport. Years later, as a sportswriter, Araton caught up with Danny Yaccarino, who came within one strike of a perfect game during that 1964 Little League World Series against Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nHe wrote a column, (‘After Perfection at the Age of 12, What's Next?’) detailing how Yaccarino became a very good high school pitcher and reached the Baltimore Orioles organization and yet, he was always haunted by the feeling of coming so close to near-perfection as a Little Leaguer and not getting it.\n\n“Not only did he get a lot of bench jockeying and all that stuff throughout his career, but he also put incredible pressure on himself,” Araton says. “He turned out to be a minor league pitcher and he never went very far. But he told me that he finished his career feeling like an abject failure.”\n\nZ feels an emptiness, too, at the climax of the book. It's a feeling that can be induced by us.\n\n\"Parents, being vulnerable, and easily manipulated into spending vast sums of money, (wind) up treating their children like they are speculating on a stock, an investment,\" Araton says. \"They're not stocks that will pay off at 8 or 9 or 10 years; they're developing human beings.\"\n\n“Z, we’re running behind,” his mother yells upstairs, trying to get him moving for his U-13 fall season-opening game. She’s now the team’s driven parent-manager.\n\n“The construction of this story is really about Z coming to an understanding of what role sports should play in his life,” Araton says. “And when I say that, I mean, at that particular time, kids are always subject to change. He's at a point in his life where he's experienced family trauma, and, when he looks around, he doesn't see the friends who he loves, the kids that he grew up playing with. He sees a lot of strange kids. And that's not what he wants. More than playing at an elite level, he wants to play with kids who know him, who know what he's gone through.\n\n“He realizes that he still loves the game, but will only play it under his terms.”\n\nIsn’t that what we all want? What about our kids, too?\n\n“You could offer them the higher-level stuff,” Araton says, “but if it's being forced upon them, and if you're calling up to their bedroom every time there's practice, then it's clear that they don't really want to do it.\n\n“I wouldn't deny an exceptional child that kind of pathway any more than you would, say, if you had a child who (was) a mathematical genius or a classical violinist, you would want them to have the best teachers to best capitalize on their special talent. But the temptation is so great because sports is the most visible thing in the community. …\n\n\"It'll become pretty obvious to a parent if they have someone special. But this whole notion that they can create one by spending significant sums of money, I think it's really overstated.”\n\nAraton points to another interview he did, with Yael Averbuch, the general manager of the New Jersey/New York Gotham FC of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). She played for an exclusive club team in high school, won two national championships playing for the University of North Carolina and was drafted professionally.\n\nHer mother said she never had to yell upstairs for practice. Yael was the one yelling to them.\n\nAraton’s sons, like Z, had to figure out where sports fit into their lives. It worked out for them, too.\n\nAlex, who played high school soccer, is a special education teacher and Charly, the high school basketball player (who has grown to about 5-foot-9 today), works in marketing strategies for a fashion brand. He still plays in men’s leagues.\n\nAraton says those middle-grade age groups – 8 to 12, give or take – are the ages where people know the least amount about who their children are as athletes.\n\n“Don’t be disappointed if at the age of 8, they are not willing to do all this stuff and make all that sacrifice,” he says. “They might be ready when they're 11. Kids do things on their own time schedules. So just accept who they are and let them experience sports in the way they want to. They’ll enjoy it more and get more out of it.\n\n“If they're not playing for the idea of feeling good about themselves, about learning to be a coachable kid, and be a good teammate, to play with kids from all different backgrounds and develop their skills at the fundamental level at the age of 7, 8, 9, 10,” Araton says, “then they're playing for the wrong reasons.\n\n“Each shall develop at their own rate. I just think that parents have to chill and let the kids experience it for themselves.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "fullText": "New York Giants fans have experienced growing frustration over the past decade as the once-successful organization has regressed into one of the league's worst. That frustration has led to some protests, including various banners demanding change being flown over MetLife Stadium.\n\nOther fans have taken their anger directly to the desk of Giants co-owner John Mara, writing him letters of disgust -- something he, like his late father, will often read and respond to, personally.\n\nThat frustration continued to grow in 2025, but with one caveat: In September, Mara revealed he had been diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"I have recently been diagnosed with cancer and have been following the treatment plan recommended by an outstanding team of doctors,\" Mara said in a statement. \"I'm feeling strong and optimistic, and I'm committed to seeing this through to a positive outcome.\n\n\"I plan to remain active with the team throughout my treatment, and I'm fortunate to be surrounded by incredible support -- personally, professionally, and medically. I ask that you respect my privacy and my family’s privacy at this time.\"\n\nAs he battled cancer, Mara was less visible around the team. And although fans remained frustrated as the Giants stumbled to just four wins, they did take some time out to show love.\n\nAlmost went to Vietnam for this pic.twitter.com/qig0c7rUz2\n\n— Giants Nation Show (@GiantsNationPod) November 2, 2025\n\nOn Friday, with the Giants firmly entrenched in offseason mode, the expressions of love, support, and prayer continued.\n\nNew York Revival, along with many other Giants fans and content creators, compiled a video message for Mara, offering their support and well wishes as he battles cancer — an evil that has impacted all of us at some point or another, in some form or fashion.\n\nA message to John Mara \nfrom the Giants Family 🙏 @Giants | #NYGiants pic.twitter.com/EvnvjkH9cX\n\n— New York Revival (@NewYorkRevival) January 9, 2026\n\nWe at Giants Wire echo that love and those prayers.

    "description": "Chrissy Traore and her husband Ben started a bakery in New York. When they needed more space, they turned to shipping containers as the solution.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chrissy Traore, 41, who opened See & Be Kitchen with her husband Ben Salif Traore in Cairo, New York, about 40 miles from Albany, New York. When their business expanded quickly, they began running parts of it out of shipping containers on their property. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBen and I met while I was a chef and he was a baker. We worked at the same restaurant — they had a bakery and a restaurant right next door, and I was their pizza chef and he was their head baker. I had to mix my pizza dough in his mixer and that's kind of how we met.\n\nBefore, I worked on Madison Avenue in marketing and brand strategy, and in 2008, the economy crashed and my job crashed too. When that happened, I moved into food. I took a job on an ice cream truck and just fell in love with food work.\n\nI was in the food industry in various ways in New York City from about 2008 until 2017.\n\nWhile working in the industry, I was unhappy with the way that they treated employees. I was in management at the time, so I could see the full round numbers.\n\nI thought, \"There has to be a better way, but it's not my job to change this business owner or this business.\"\n\nBen and I talked a lot about it, and we were going upstate frequently — I was working at a place upstate as their first chef.\n\nI said, \"We should really move upstate.\" It's more our speed. We like the outdoors. We like having space. The quality of life is better. We love farming and being close to what's happening on the ground, literally. In 2017 we said, let's get out of the city.\n\nWe didn't have a ton of money, and we had to be scrappy and thoughtful about how we deployed the resources that we had saved. We wanted a place where we could live and work, so we wanted property and land — that was important to us.\n\nWe found a property in Cairo, New York, and it had been a bar and a hotel, so it was already grandfathered in on DOH, and had some structures there. We have 11 acres, and the house was practically falling apart, so we could afford it. We paid $189,900, and that was it. We went all in.\n\nWe knew we wanted to open our own place and we were trying to discover what that was. We knew it would involve Ben's bread and my cooking.\n\nWe started renovating the property and doing farmers markets, and that's how we got to know the community that we were in.\n\nWe came in quietly, like, \"Let's see what's already here and get to know people before we just bash them over the head with what we do.\" Let's see what they want, because ultimately we're entering a community that's not necessarily ours yet.\n\nWe were moving from Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn, and part of the reason we moved out was we saw that happening. People were moving in and they would say, \"We need to fix this. This is broken.\" And I'm like, \"What is broken? This is a wonderful community. Please stop.\"\n\nSometime in 2018, we turned into See & Be. Then, from there, we really got some traction at farmers markets.\n\nWe were doing porch pickups — people could pick up their orders at a local massage therapist's house — so we had started operating, but we didn't have a physical space yet.\n\nWe were still building out the cafe in the very small already existing structure on our property. We had one oven, with one proofer, a little cooktop that I would do the sandwiches on, and a coffee station with this beautiful wooden bar that people could sit at. And we opened that in February of 2019. Ben baked everything; I ran the front of house.\n\nWe had a five-year plan and it went into overdrive. Soon, we needed more space, and I could not get a building up fast enough. With traditional buildings, we looked at it and we thought it was going to take a year and a half to two years. We couldn't do that. We needed space like tomorrow.\n\nI had worked for a company while in Brooklyn that was actually my first shipping container job. That was at the DeKalb Market, and it was all built out of shipping containers.\n\nI realized there was no way to get a building through the planning board and everything quickly enough — but I could get a shipping container.\n\nI looked at Ben and I said, \"The fastest way we can do this is to get a shipping container.\" And he said, \"Are you kidding?\" I said, \"No.\"\n\nWe really bootstrapped our business from day one. We had a $10,000 investment in building out the space over time. We costed it out, and we could afford it with what we had already made in the business.\n\nWe got our approval and I was so excited. I posted it on our Facebook page and we got over 4,000 interactions. We couldn't not open.\n\nOur first shipping container was a regular shipping container — a 40' by 20' high cube. We placed it on wooden rail ties, which was not great — those degraded over the years, especially with heavy usage.\n\nWe thought of ourselves as scrappy: \"Well, we did the cafe, we can do this ourselves. So why would I pay to have a spray foam? We'll do that ourselves.\" That was terrible idea.\n\nI think we bought every spray foam insulation canister in a 200-mile radius of here from Home Depot and Lowe's. We didn't know what we were doing. We were just trying to figure it out. The walls were uneven and it worked, but it wasn't a great solution.\n\nThen we pushed out of that shipping container and needed even more space. At that point, we needed more cold storage. I started doing more research into shipping containers and came across decommissioned reefers.\n\nThey're pre-insulated and have steel walls. And unlike a regular shipping container that has a wood floor, this has a steel flat floor. So it's already food-ready.\n\nWe bought the first container for $6,000 painted and delivered. And then we spent another couple thousand dollars in spray foam. God only knows how much the labor was, because we did it ourselves and that took forever.\n\nWe have running water and electric in the containers, but most of the mixing happens in our original building.\n\nThat following year, as our business grew and began to quickly scale, we kept outgrowing our space and needing more and more room. Once we saw how quickly we could get a shipping container in place — about a month — it was easy to go, \"OK, well, gee, trucks can double my space in a month.\"\n\nThe second container was much faster and easier to set up. I bought that directly through a broker at the port. We paid $8,500 for that one.\n\nWhen we installed the second container, we leveled the ground, put in concrete pillars, and the cranes came in and moved the original container and did that whole process. Then, with the third container, it was very easy to attach it because the ground was already graded and leveled.\n\nIt cost about $7,500 to $15,000 per container at the end of the day, because we had to get the crane to get them moved, and we had to get them welded together.\n\nIt's always funny when someone comes up to the building for the first time, and they're just like, \"What is this? Where is the bakery?\" And then they knock on a shipping container door.\n\nPeople are always shook to see that it's a real production. They think we're winging this or pretending because there's these shipping containers. But when you walk in, you forget you're in a shipping container.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A judge’s ruling that a Trump administration prosecutor in upstate New York was serving unlawfully has spilled into another case — with the same judge saying he can’t obtain tax return information in a criminal investigation because he lacks authority.\n\nThe ruling Thursday against prosecutor John Sarcone from U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield came the same day the judge disqualified Sarcone from overseeing investigations into Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. In that case, Schofield ruled that Sarcone was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York and that any “of his past or future acts taken in that capacity are void or voidable.”\n\nSarcone is among the prosecutors around the country found by federal judges to lack authority after the Republican administration used unusual maneuvers to place them or keep them in their posts without U.S. Senate confirmation.\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, said Schofield's ruling was consistent with previous decisions.\n\n“It does seem like more and more courts are coming around to this view,” he said.\n\nIn a separate ruling Thursday, Schofield denied Sarcone's application for a court order directing the IRS to disclose tax return information for a limited liability company as part of a criminal investigation. The application remains sealed and it's not clear who filed the tax returns sought in the Oct. 2 request.\n\nApplications for that tax information can only be made by officials holding specific positions, such as U.S. attorneys. The Manhattan judge said Sarcone lacked authority to authorize the application because he was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney — mirroring her reasoning in the case involving James.\n\nAn email seeking comment was sent to the northern district.\n\nCourts in New Jersey, Nevada and California have held that similarly installed acting U.S. attorneys lacked lawful authority. Trump’s former personal attorney, Alina Habba,resigned as the top federal prosecutor for New Jersey in December after an appeals court said she had been serving unlawfully.",

    "title": "Why Trump is suing The New York Times — and giving them 2-hour interviews",
    "description": "The president uses digital media to get his message across — but he really loves old media like newspapers and cable TV.",
    "fullText": "Last fall, Donald Trump filed a $15 billion defamation suit against The New York Times. That suit is still ongoing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sat down with Times reporters at the White House for a 2-hour interview, where he expounded on his worldview, conducted an off-the-record conversation with the president of Colombia, and showed off new plans to renovate the West Wing.\n\nIf that surprises you, it shouldn't. Trump, and the rest of his administration, love to complain about the Times and other big, mainstream media outfits. They also love talking to them.\n\nEarlier this week, for instance, key Trump advisor Stephen Miller appeared on CNN for a much-discussed interview with Jake Tapper, where he laid out a bellicose view of America's role in the world.\n\nA few days before that, Trump talked to The Wall Street Journal — another publication he's currently suing — for a story about his health and fitness.\n\nAnd last month Vanity Fair published a lengthy profile of Susie Wiles, Trump's chief of staff, which involved multiple interviews with Wiles and portraits of her and other Trump officials, including Miller, Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nTrump has made mainstream media a target since he started running for president in 2015, calling reports he doesn't like \"fake news,\" and labeling journalists \"enemies of the people.\" He's called for a change in US libel law, so he can more easily punish journalists, and he often insists that TV networks that irk him should have their broadcast licenses revoked.\n\nAnd his rhetoric and actions have ramped up in his second term, where he has banned the Associated Press from events in the Oval Office, stocked the White House briefing room with Trump-friendly outlets, and pushed out all mainstream reporters from the Pentagon.\n\nAll of that should worry anyone who cares about press freedom — or in less lofty terms, the ability of the press to accurately tell you what's happening in the federal government.\n\nThe flip of that is quite simple: Trump is a man who grew up in a world dominated by traditional media — newspapers and television — and he still cares very much about what traditional media says about him, no matter what he says. That's why he delights in constant press appearances in the White House, aboard Air Force One, and anywhere else reporters have cameras, microphones, and notepads.\n\nI often think of an AP photo from last spring, shortly after he'd announced his initial, chaotic tariff plan, that shows him perusing the New York Post's coverage of that plan in the back of his limousine. We focus a lot of attention on Trump's ability to use Twitter, YouTube, podcasts, and other digital media to shape public perception. But he's very much an old media guy — print, broadcast, cable.\n\nAnd as long as those things still exist, Trump will want to be in them and flattered by their coverage. Which explains why he can sue them and invite them into his office at the same time.",

    "title": "I run alcohol-free nightlife events in NYC. Most of my guests aren't sober — they just don't want to drink.",
    "description": "Sam Bail, the founder of Bright Nights Social, told Business Insider that demand is booming for her alcohol-free nightlife events in New York.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Bail, a data engineer and the founder of the alcohol-free pop-up event company, Bright Nights Social. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThree years ago, I had the idea to open an alcohol-free bar in New York City.\n\nI don't drink, but I still wanted nightlife — dancing, music, meeting new people, getting out of the house on a Friday or Saturday night. What I didn't want was another alcohol-free space that was centered on wellness, meditation, or yoga. I wanted something that still felt like real nightlife, just without booze being the main event.\n\nInstead of signing a lease, I started testing the idea by hosting pop-up events. I'd take over coffee shops or other venues at night and turn them into alcohol-free bars for the evening.\n\nWhat started as an experiment quickly took on a life of its own.\n\nOver the past three years, I've collaborated with tons of venues, experimented with a variety of new formats, and thousands of people have come through our doors. That's been the most surprising part of all of this: the demand.\n\nWhat's even more interesting? Most of the people who attend my events aren't even sober.\n\nWhen people hear \"alcohol-free event,\" they often assume the crowd is made up entirely of sober or sober-curious people. That hasn't been my experience at all. Based on conversations with guests, I estimate that at least 75% of the people who attend my events don't identify as sober or even sober-curious.\n\nThey're mostly in their mid-20s to early 30s — older Gen Z and very young millennials. Gender splits depend on the event, but many of my parties are close to 50-50 men and women. What they have in common is that they want to go out, socialize, and have fun without making drinking the center of their entire social life.\n\nI'm 40, so I'm an elder millennial who's already done the heavy partying phase and is over it. But many of the people who come to Bright Nights Social are younger than me and feel the same way. They'll tell me things like, \"I still drink sometimes, I just don't want to do it every time I go out,\" or \"Alcohol makes me feel terrible the next day.\"\n\nThey're not abstaining out of moral opposition to alcohol or because of addiction. They're opting out because they don't like the cost, the hangovers, or the way drinking dominates social life in cities like New York.\n\nWhat I see aligns with a broader shift happening right now, especially among younger people. There's a growing focus on experiences rather than just going to a bar and spending money on drinks. In New York City, you can see it everywhere: pottery classes, cooking classes, rug tufting, late-night library events, group reading clubs.\n\nSome of my favorites have been hosting cooking classes and our crafting events, like rug-making. Coming up this month, we have a tea bar, a bagel-making (and eating!) class, and a full-on dance party, complete with DJs and a full non-alcoholic bar, to close out Dry January.\n\nPeople want to do something. They want to make memories. They just don't want to wake up feeling awful the next day.\n\nCost is also a big factor. When cocktails are $15 or $20 each, it doesn't take long for a casual night out to become extremely expensive. A lot of people tell me they'd rather spend their money on an experience than on alcohol that doesn't even make them feel good.\n\nThat doesn't mean Gen Z isn't drinking at all. In fact, some recent data suggests younger people are actually drinking more now than they were a year or two ago. I think part of that is a post-pandemic catch-up effect — many Gen Zers reached legal drinking age during lockdowns and simply didn't have the chance to go out.\n\nWhat I see on the ground is moderation. People might have one drink at dinner and then switch to a nonalcoholic beer. Or they'll alternate between alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks throughout the night — what some people call \"zebra striping.\" They're being much more intentional about how and when they drink.\n\nAnother huge shift I'm seeing is the role of legal THC. I don't serve THC products at my events, but I don't stop anyone from having one before they come, and I hear about them constantly from guests and friends who work at nonalcoholic bottle shops. THC drinks are some of the best-selling products in those stores.\n\nPeople understand what THC does. They say it helps with social anxiety, takes the edge off, and feels more manageable than alcohol when used in moderation. Compared to that, there's still skepticism around functional or adaptogenic drinks — things with nootropics, ashwagandha, or functional mushrooms. Many people aren't convinced that those drinks actually do anything beyond being a placebo.\n\nThat said, I think we're still early. As people learn what works for their own bodies — whether that's L-theanine, lion's mane, or something else — those functional beverages may gain more traction.\n\nAt the same time, I'm also seeing conversations online about people pulling back from THC after overdoing it, so I think we'll see a similar trend as people try to find nightlife events that best suit their needs.\n\nI don't think most people want to be completely sober forever, but they are actively experimenting with what moderation looks like.\n\nThe biggest misconception about alcohol-free nightlife is that it's boring or restrictive. What I've learned is that people don't want to be told what not to do — they just want more options.\n\nBright Nights Social isn't about sobriety as an identity. It's about creating a space where alcohol isn't the default. You can still dance, flirt, meet strangers, and stay out late. The only difference is that you're not expected to drink to participate.\n\nThe fact that so many non-sober people show up tells me this isn't a niche idea anymore. Alcohol-free nightlife isn't just for people who've quit drinking entirely. It's for anyone who wants to go out — and wake up the next day feeling like themselves.\n\nDo you host or attend alternative nightlife events? Contact this reporter at ktl@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Nearly 16,000 nurses set to join union-led strike Monday to demand large hospitals across NYC ‘put patients over profit’",
    "fullText": "Nearly 16,000 nurses in New York City are set to strike on Monday amid a battle over pay during contract negotiations.\n\nThe action, due to take place across five large hospitals, is being organized by the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA), which is demanding the hospitals put patients over profit.\n\nThe hospitals insist they continue to bargain in good faith, and have accused the union of trying to disrupt patient care.\n\nCEO compensation at three hospitals – Montefiore, Mount Sinai, and New York Presbyterian – is nearly 12,000 times more than that of the average nurse, according to the union.\n\nNancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, who has worked at Maimonides medical center in Brooklyn for over 30 years, told the Guardian that the hospitals are pushing to scale back safe staffing ratios, refusing to guarantee healthcare benefit coverage for nurses, and declining to address workplace safety issues.\n\nThree of the major hospitals involved in contract negotiations have $1.6bn cash or cash equivalent on hand, according to the union, which said they have already started hiring travel nurses to replace those striking in preparation for a strike.\n\n“What we are asking them is to take those millions and invest it into the community so we could continue to work to care for our patients, invest it into staffing, invest those millions into our medical coverage so we could come to work,” said Hagans. “We’re not taking this lightly. We’re not asking to strike. Management is the one who’s telling us that we need to strike. They are the ones putting us on the picket line.”\n\nShe cited safety issues that stem from a drastic increase of assaults on healthcare workers since the Covid-19 pandemic, and an active shooter incident at Mount Sinai last November, where three nurses were reportedly disciplined for speaking out afterwards.\n\n“The large, wealthy hospitals are much better off financially than they were three years ago, but yet they’re asking for takeaways,” claimed Hagans. “They told us to choose between our wages or keeping our healthcare and safe staffing, because we cannot have it all. The safety of a patient should never be a bargaining chip. Nurses will not cut corners on patients and their safety. Nurses are just demanding that New York City private hospitals put patients over profit.”\n\nNurses represented by NYSNA issued 10-day strike notices on 2 January at a string of New York hospitals. On Tuesday, seven of the smaller hospitals moved forward in contract negotiations, with the union rescinding their strike notice.\n\nAbout 1,000 nurses at three Northwell hospitals in Long Island have also issued strike notices.\n\n“Our nurses have been at the bargaining table since September 2025 with little to no movement,” said Simone Way, a member of the NYSNA executive committee, and a nurse at Mount Sinai Morningside hospital. “Even though we started this process in September, there have been committees in the hospital having these same discussions on staffing since January 2025, so it’s no surprise to our management the things nurses feel we need.”\n\nWay also criticized hospital management’s efforts to blame the strike on nurses, claiming they are putting patients at risk and asking for too much. “They do have the money, but they don’t appear to be willing to invest that money in their nurses or into the ability for us to provide the best care humanly possible to our patients,” she said.\n\nMount Sinai denied retaliation claims against nurses following November’s active-shooter incident, and denied attempting to take away healthcare benefits for nurses. A spokesperson said: “We are continuing to bargain in good faith in the hopes of reaching an agreement that is fair, reasonable, and responsible, but unfortunately just a week before a potential strike NYSNA has refused to move off of its extreme economic proposals that demand hospitals like ours spend billions of dollars on increased nursing compensation and additional hires.”\n\nThey claimed “most of the union’s claims about bargaining are untrue”, and confirmed that the hospital is taking steps to prepare in case of a strike.\n\nNew York Presbyterian blamed the union for not budging on wages. “NYSNA’s threatened strike is intended to disrupt patient care across the city,” a spokesperson said. “We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that our patients will continue to receive safe, exceptional care. We will always meet our fundamental obligation to the communities we serve.”\n\nMontefiore did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "GUATIRE, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela released citizens and foreigners from its prisons on Thursday in what a top government official described as a gesture to “seek peace” less than a week after former President Nicolás Maduro was captured by U.S. forces to face federal drug-trafficking charges in New York.\n\nJorge Rodríguez, brother of acting President Delcy Rodríguez and head of the National Assembly, said a “significant number” of people would be freed, but he was not specific about how many or provide names.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have freed political prisoners before, but the releases on Thursday were the first since Maduro was deposed. Human rights groups were encouraged by the releases, though it wasn’t clear yet whether this might represent the early stages of a government in transition or was more of a symbolic effort to please the Trump administration, which has allowed Maduro’s loyalists to stay in control even as it exerts political pressure through crippling sanctions.\n\nJournalists, lawyers and human rights activists were among those freed on Thursday, and families waited outside a notorious prison in hopes their loved ones would be among the detainees released.\n\n“Consider this a gesture by the Bolivarian government, which is broadly intended to seek peace,” Rodríguez said in an announcement publicized over TV.\n\nNGO: 863 detained for ‘political reasons’\n\nAlfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, an advocacy group for prisoners based in Caracas, praised Thursday’s release as “good news” that lifted Venezuelans’ hopes that all political detainees in the country may walk free.\n\nBut he stressed that he wanted this to become “the beginning of the dismantling of the repressive system” of Maduro’s government and not remain “a mere gesture, a charade of releasing some prisoners and incarcerating others.”\n\nDespite a widespread crackdown during the tumultuous 2024 election – in which the government said it detained 2,000 people – Venezuela's government denies that there are “political prisoners” and accuses those detained of plotting to destabilize Maduro’s government.\n\nRomero's organization said that as of Dec. 29, 2025, there were 863 people detained in Venezuela “for political reasons.”\n\nThe Spanish government announced Thursday that five Spanish citizens were among those released in Venezuela and would soon return to Spain.\n\nForeign Minister José Manuel Albares confirmed the group includes prominent Venezuelan-Spanish lawyer and human rights activist Rocío San Miguel. Speaking to Spanish broadcaster RNE, he also confirmed that Spanish citizens Andrés Martínez, José María Basoa, Ernesto Gorbe and Miguel Moreno were freed.\n\nBasoa and Martínez were arrested in Venezuela in September 2024, accused by officials of being involved in a plot to destabilize Maduro’s government as Spanish intelligence agents, allegations that Spanish authorities denied at the time. Spain’s El País newspaper reported Thursday that Gorbe had been living in Venezuela and was arrested in 2024, accused of being in the country illegally with an expired visa.\n\nA number of families of those detained rushed to wait outside of a number of Venezuelan prisons on Thursday, hoping to reunite with their loved ones.\n\nPedro Durán, 60, was among those hoping to wrap his arm around his brother Franklin Durán as he waited outside a prison in the town of Guatire, around 25 miles (43 kilometers) outside of Caracas. Durán said his brother was detained in 2021 on charges of trying to overthrow Maduro’s government — an accusation the family fiercely denies.\n\nDurán, who has been living in Spain, heard rumors that the government may be releasing a number of detainees on Wednesday and immediately bought a plane ticket from Madrid to Caracas to find his brother.\n\n“I don’t have words to express the emotion I’m feeling,” Durán said. “We’re feeling a lot of hope ... We’re just waiting now.”\n\nDespite the anticipation, fear persists in parts of the South American country as residents brace for an uncertain future.\n\n“Of course everyone here is very scared, but what more could (the government) do to us that they haven’t done already,” he said.\n\nRonal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuelan Observatory at the University of Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia, said the government periodically releases prisoners at politically strategic moments.\n\nIn July last year, Venezuela released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in exchange for getting home more than 200 migrants deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador, where they were held in a prison built to hold alleged gang members.\n\n“The regime uses them (prisoners) like a bargaining chip,” he said, adding that he and other observers will be watching not just how many people the government releases, but also whether high-profile individuals are included or if they're being released under a condition of house arrest.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration sought to assert its control over Venezuelan oil, seizing a pair of sanctioned tankers transporting petroleum and announcing plans to relax some sanctions so the U.S. can oversee the sale of Venezuela’s petroleum worldwide.\n\nBoth moves reflect the administration’s determination to make good on its effort to control the next steps in Venezuela through its vast oil resources after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged after the capture of Maduro that the U.S. will “run” the country.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "title": "New York Jets - Picking 16: A Preliminary View",
    "description": "An Early Look At The Four Most Mocked Players The Jets Could Select With The 16th Pick",
    "fullText": "Well, the season is over. The tank is complete, and after weeks of speculation, the Jets will be picking No. 2 overall.\n\nAt No. 2, there are still plenty of questions about what direction they take. If Dante Moore declares, the debate will almost certainly center on whether the Jets go quarterback, trade back, or simply take the best player on the board. That discussion is fairly straightforward and will dominate much of the early draft conversation.\n\nHowever, there’s another pick the Jets own that isn’t getting nearly the same level of attention.\n\nThanks to the Colts’ collapse down the stretch and their failure to make the playoffs, the pick they traded to the Jets now lands in the top half of the draft. For a team with holes all over the roster, that’s a massive asset.\n\nWe’ll dive much deeper into these prospects as we get closer to April, and it’s important to note that draft boards can change rapidly between January and draft night. But for now, let’s take a brief look at the four most popular players players mocked to the Jets with this pick:\n\nBailey immediately emerges as a popular potential target for the Jets.\n\nA four-year senior who began his career at Stanford before transferring to Texas Tech, Bailey has been on draft radars for the better part of the last two years. However, it was his senior season that truly launched his draft stock. After entering the year viewed as more of a mid–second-round prospect, Bailey has climbed to consensus No. 11 overall on most big boards.\n\nThe book on Bailey is fairly simple: he’s an elite college pass rusher.\n\nAfter two solid seasons at Stanford, Bailey took a major leap in his junior year, becoming one of the highest-graded pass rushers in the country. With a larger national stage at Texas Tech, he only continued that ascent, arguably becoming the most dominant pass rusher in college football this past season. With better coverage behind him, his sack total also exploded with 15 sacks this past year.\n\nBailey is the highest-graded pass rusher in the country on both true pass sets and overall snaps. He leads the nation in PRP—a PFF metric that combines sacks, hits, and hurries relative to pass-rush opportunities—and also ranks first in win rate on true pass sets, measuring how often he beats his blocker on non-penalty pass-rush snaps.\n\nThe athletic profile jumps off the page as well. Bailey is fast, explosive, and incredibly productive. He reportedly bench-pressed 405 pounds, squatted 550, and has been clocked at 22.16 mph. There’s a lot to like.\n\nThe concerns, however, are also easy to spot.\n\nBailey is undersized, listed at 250 pounds (a number that appears generous given he doesn’t look much different from the 240 pounds he was listed at during his Stanford days). That size raises legitimate questions about his ability to set the edge, hold up against the run, and rein in some of his more reckless tendencies.\n\nUltimately, there are two very different ways to view Bailey depending on the story you are going to tell yourself. On one hand, you’re getting a freaky, explosive, highly productive pass rusher, something the Jets desperately need. On the other, you may be drafting a situational edge defender who can’t consistently stay on the field for all three downs due to size limitations.\n\nWith Will McDonald already on the roster and facing similar concerns, it remains to be seen whether the Jets would be willing to take another swing on this type of profile.\n\nKeldric Faulk:\n\nWe’ll continue the trend of examining potential pass rushers at pick No. 16, but this one couldn’t be more different from David Bailey.\n\nKeldric Faulk is a specimen. If you were designing an NFL edge rusher in a lab, it would look a lot like Faulk. He stands 6’6”, carries long arms, and weighs in at 285 pounds a drastically different body type than the Jets’ current edge rushers in Will McDonald and Jermaine Johnson.\n\nFaulk is also a completely different type of player than Bailey. While Bailey lined up almost exclusively outside the offensive tackle, Faulk has been used all over the front. Over the past two seasons, he’s aligned outside the tackle roughly 55–60% of the time, but Auburn has also deployed him over tackles and even inside over guards. He’s been asked to do everything.\n\nThat versatility shows up most clearly against the run. Faulk has graded extremely well in run defense, ranking in the top 25 in both stop rate and run-defense grade in each of the last two seasons. What makes that even more impressive is his age, he’s been doing this at 19 and 20 years old in the SEC.\n\nThe pass-rushing profile, however, is very much a work in progress and that’s where the concerns begin.\n\nMost notably, Faulk took a step back as a pass rusher this season. After recording nine sacks as a 19-year-old sophomore, his sack total dropped to just two this past year. His underlying metrics tell a similar story, as he ranked outside the top 50 in both pressure rate and win rate. There is an important caveat here: pressure and win rates tend to decline when a player isn’t used primarily as a stand-up edge rusher outside the tackle. Still, the pass-rush skill set clearly needs refinement.\n\nFaulk will be one of the more fascinating evaluations in this class, particularly depending on how he tests. On first glance, he appears plenty athletic (especially for his size) and it’s notable how well he already carries his frame at just 20 years old. It’s easy to see why he’s been viewed as a mid–first-round pick at worst for much of the year.\n\nThe questions, however, are largely tied to projection.\n\nThe best-case scenario is a complete edge defender: a powerful run stopper who leverages his size and athleticism into becoming a legitimate plus pass rusher at the next level. The concern is more straightforward, he never fully develops the pass-rushing tools needed to consistently win in the NFL.\n\nThat variance is what makes Faulk such a fascinating, and potentially polarizing, option for the Jets at No. 16.\n\nMoving away from edge rusher to another position of need, wide receiver will undoubtedly be one of the most talked-about spots to address in this year’s draft especially if the Jets do select a quarterback at pick No. 2. Makai Lemon, by all accounts, appears to be a very legitimate option considering where he ranks on consensus big boards. Over the last three months of the draft process, Lemon has hovered anywhere from the early 20s to as high as No. 16, where he currently sits on several boards.\n\nLemon is a fascinating evaluation. From a production standpoint, it’s hard to find many receivers as consistently productive as he’s been. After entering USC as a highly rated recruit, Lemon broke out during his sophomore season, finishing with 52 catches for 764 yards and three touchdowns on 67 targets. From an efficiency perspective, he was outstanding—posting a high catch rate while adding an elite 3.03 yards per route run.\n\nAt just 21 years old, Lemon took another leap as a junior and emerged as one of the best wide receivers in college football. He finished the season as the highest-graded receiver in the country, totaling 79 catches, 1,156 yards, and 11 touchdowns. Among qualified Power Four receivers, he ranked third nationally in yards per route run and finished top 10 in missed tackles forced, drop rate, and passer rating when targeted. Any way you slice it, Lemon was both dominant and efficient.\n\nThe main concern with Lemon, (and the first thing evaluators will point to) is his size. Listed at 5’11”, 195 pounds, Lemon spent most of his time at USC operating out of the slot. While he did expand his role this season, he still lined up outside on just 28% of his snaps.\n\nThat leads to the obvious questions: can Lemon consistently beat press man coverage at the NFL level against bigger, more physical defensive backs? And does the lack of true top-end speed (he’s rumored to run in the 4.45–4.50 range) cap his upside? Those answers will come with time.\n\nThe Jaxson Smith-Njigba comparison is going to come up frequently throughout this draft cycle given how similar their profiles are in terms of size, production, usage, and athleticism. But one thing is clear: if you’re looking for an advanced route runner with elite production, there simply aren’t many better options in this draft than Makai Lemon.\n\nWe’ll close out this article with our final player and undoubtedly the most polarizing name on the list: Peter Woods.\n\nWoods has been in the spotlight for a long time now. The buzz around him has been loud for nearly two years, dating back to when he burst onto the scene at Clemson as a true freshman. From the very beginning, Woods was a very good player.\n\nAt just 18 years old, Woods made an immediate impact. During his freshman season, while primarily playing as a 1-tech and 3-tech, he established himself as an elite run defender. He finished as a top-eight run defender in the country by PFF grade and ranked second nationally among all defensive linemen in stop rate. For an 18-year-old freshman playing in the Power Four, that level of production is remarkable.\n\nHe followed up his breakout freshman year with another strong campaign as a sophomore. Clemson used him differently, lining him up more frequently as a traditional defensive end and even placing him outside the tackles at times. As a result, his pass-rush metrics took a step forward. Despite still spending the majority of his snaps inside, Woods graded well as a pass rusher when asked to attack the quarterback. His win rate ranked top 10 nationally among non-edge rushers, and in true pass sets—albeit on a smaller sample—he finished top 15 at the position.\n\nBecause of that trajectory, Woods entered the season as a consensus top-five prospect. He also earned a spot on Bruce Feldman’s Freaks List, where Feldman wrote:\n\n“His latest body composition scans prior to camp showed that 240 of his 310 pounds are lean muscle mass. He’s a rare combination of power and speed for a 300-plus-pounder. This offseason, Woods bench pressed 490 pounds and did 34 reps of 225. He squatted 700 pounds and power cleaned 385, ran a 4.86 40-yard dash and vertical jumped 33 inches.”\n\nUnfortunately, Woods’ junior season was a clear disappointment. He moved back exclusively to the interior, and his production and grading took a noticeable step back. From a win-rate and pressure standpoint, he fell outside the top 50 among qualified defensive linemen. It’s fair to note that producing high pressure and win rates is more difficult when playing nose tackle and interior defensive line, but even accounting for alignment, his results were underwhelming compared to peers in similar roles. The dominant run defense he showed early in his career also regressed.\n\nAs a result, Woods has slid from being a consensus top-five player on big boards to someone who could legitimately fall out of the top half of the first round on draft night.\n\nWoods remains a fascinating evaluation. From a size and athleticism standpoint, he checks every box at 6’3”, 315 pounds. He’s shown flashes of high-level play as both a run defender and a pass rusher. But it’s impossible to ignore the step back in performance this past season. Simply put, he’s well behind the sack and tackle-for-loss production you’d typically expect from a defensive lineman selected in the middle of the first round. A concern to say the least.\n\nAs previously mentioned, these rankings are cyclical by nature. While these four players are the most commonly mocked to the Jets at this point in the process, it’s unlikely they’ll be the same names we’re seeing come April once testing results and additional information start to reshape boards.\n\nWe’ll continue to monitor the class and take a deeper look at all of these prospects (including those listed above) over the coming months.",

Right there. Pulitzer Prize! He got one for the bullet,” Trump said, drawing applause from the crowd.\n\n“These are the ones that take the pictures. Make me look thin for a change, Doug,” he quipped. “You’re making me look a little bit heavy. I’m not happy about it.”\n\nBut Democrats think there’s little photographers can do to help the president.\n\nNot the photographers' fault https://t.co/EI8nukJYJK pic.twitter.com/oggK2CqUXd\n\n— Democrats (@TheDemocrats) January 6, 2026\n\n“Not the photographers’ fault,” they wrote in an X post, attaching candid images of Trump taken from less-than-flattering angles.\n\nTrump, a high-flying socialite and TV personality before he entered the White House, has long been conscious of his public image.\n\nIn October, he threw a Truth Social meltdown after TIME magazine put him on the cover using a photo taken from a low angle, which highlighted the drooping skin on his neck. It didn’t help that his hair practically disappeared into the sky above him.\n\n“They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one,” Trump wrote. “Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?”\n\nThe aging president is 6’ 3” and weighs 224 pounds, according to the results of his annual physical exam released last April. His BMI puts him in the overweight category, though the president’s physician Sean Barbabella has repeatedly cleared Trump as being in “excellent health.”\n\nTrump’s fast-food-heavy diet and love for Diet Coke are unlikely to see him shed pounds soon. Florida state senator Joe Gruters once said he saw Trump eat McDonald’s fries, a Filet-O-Fish, a Quarter Pounder, and a Big Mac all in one sitting.\n\nAs for exercise, Trump doesn’t care for much physical activity outside of the golf course.\n\n“I just don’t like it. It’s boring,” Trump told The Wall Street Journal about his opinion of exercise. “To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that’s not for me.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment about the Democratic Party’s post.",

    "description": "Growing up in Fort Lauderdale and moving to New York City has taught me that the cities we dream of won't always meet our expectations, and that's OK.",
    "fullText": "For nearly 20 years of my life, I lived in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe beaches, palm trees, and Pub Subs (sub sandwiches from Publix, for those unfamiliar) that were part of other people's vacations were staples of my everyday life.\n\nMaybe that's why I started yearning for somewhere that wasn't as calm and steady as I was used to — somewhere like New York City.\n\nI visited NYC for the first time in 2016, and four visits later, I made it my goal to live there one day.\n\nEach trip welcomed me with new experiences and places to explore. Getting to walk out of my hotel with no set itinerary and discover local coffee shops or pocket parks was a feeling I genuinely believed couldn't be replicated elsewhere.\n\nUnlike my days in Florida, which sometimes felt repetitive, New York always felt fresh.\n\nSo, in July, I made the leap and moved to the Big Apple. Like other transplants in their early 20s, I wanted to feel like I was living in a place that mattered, and the city's energy was intoxicating.\n\nDay by day, since moving to New York City, I've become more aware of the realities that come with actually living in the place I dreamed of.\n\nAs a tourist, I curated my experiences, planned my trips around perfect weather, and was able to appreciate a slowed-down version of the city.\n\nBut living in the city comes with a pace that's impossible to ignore.\n\nPublic transportation is crowded, fast-paced, and something I've learned to take into account when planning my days. I've had to learn to make decisions faster, leave earlier than necessary, and accept that even the smallest disruptions can throw off my entire day.\n\nPlus, the so-called \"New York tax\" that forces me to spend at least $30 the moment I walk out the door has been a humbling dose of reality.\n\nMoments like schlepping groceries in bad weather have made me miss how South Florida provides more space to slow down, too.\n\nI used to see New York City as a fantasy, but as a resident, I'm realizing that maybe that was the version I created for the \"me\" who was just passing through.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still see New York City's appeal — just not in the ways I used to. In the same way tourists flock to the beaches I grew up on, I now see NYC as a destination people project their biggest hopes onto.\n\nAfter months of living here, I've come to realize that the mundane aspects of everyday life are what make the city feel like home, from catching an express train just before it leaves the station to waving to my building's super.\n\nAnd now, I'm able to take these lessons home to Fort Lauderdale when I visit, which I've come to see in a whole new light.\n\nOn my first trip home, the beaches I used to visit every other month, and the constant hot weather I'd tried to avoid, carried a sense of charm I had really never appreciated growing up.\n\nExperiencing it from the perspective of someone who left made me feel grateful for all the little details I used to overlook.\n\nAfter that visit, I finally understood: A place can lose its appeal once it becomes familiar, but that doesn't mean it's no longer special. A dream city may never truly live up to the images we create of it, and that's OK.\n\nI'm learning to love New York's imperfections and am enjoying rediscovering the beauty of South Florida as well.\n\nBut moreover, I'm learning to accept that home doesn't have to be a place that constantly amazes me. It's where I choose to keep building, flaws and all — and for now, that place is New York City.",

Its ranking also considered factors like housing availability, whether the city had a community of young people, the average estimated commute time, and affordability, which was weighted as one of the most important factors in Realtor.com's analysis.\n\nAffordability remains one of the largest barriers to Americans trying to break into the housing market for the first time.\n\nThe 30-year mortgage rate clocked in at around 6.15% in the last week of 2025, according to data from Freddie Mac — still elevated compared to levels over the last decade, particularly during the pandemic, when many home loans were going for under 3%.\n\nThe median sales price of a US home, meanwhile, hovered around $410,800 in the second quarter of last year, according to US Census data, close to a record high.\n\nHere are the cities where Realtor.com thinks first-time buyers could catch a break.\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 21.3%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 21 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 23\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 19.9%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 23 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 37.9\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 13.0%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 25 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 47.8\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 18.9%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 24 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 43.5\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 17.4%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 23 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 39.2\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 20.4%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 20 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 21.0\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 19.1%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 31 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 52.6\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 25.2%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 22 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 42.4\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 23.5%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 25 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 33.7\n\nEst. share of households with young homeowners (ages 25 to 34): 12.4%\n\nEst. average commute to work: 24 minutes\n\nAvailable inventory for every 1,000 households: 50.2",
