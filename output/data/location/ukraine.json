    "title": "Russia's Oil Revenue, the Lifeblood of Its War Machine, Is Plummeting",
    "description": "The new reality has forced the Kremlin to raise taxes and increase debt, and hovers over peace talks with Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "As Russia holds direct peace talks with Ukraine for the first time in months, the Kremlin’s most potent fuel for the war, oil revenue, is under mounting strain.\n\nThe price of Russian oil, the country’s primary export, has declined under the weight of surging global supplies and Western sanctions related to the war. Last year, Russia’s oil and gas revenue fell by almost a quarter, according to the Finance Ministry. The Kremlin is resorting to tax increases and deficit spending to bridge the gap.\n\nSo far, there is little sign that the economic strains, and any discontent they generate among business leaders and the public, will be enough to change President Vladimir V. Putin’s calculations on the war. Trilateral negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine and the United States are set to continue on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBut with the economy stagnating and the Kremlin reaching the limit of what it can squeeze from it, the Russian people will have to bear more of the burden of a war whose costs exceed about $170 billion a year.\n\n“This situation is manageable,” said Yevgeny Nadorshin, an economist in Moscow who advises companies and banks. “But no one is comfortable with that.”\n\nThroughout his decades-long rule, Mr. Putin has taken pride in the stability he has brought to a Russian economy that was in free fall after the demise of the Soviet Union — slashing debt, streamlining taxes and taming inflation.\n\nA strong oil economy allowed the Russian state to deliver an improved standard of living. That, the Kremlin hoped, would keep the public content even as the government eroded personal freedoms.\n\nNow, the carefully cultivated economic stability is fracturing. The steep drop in oil revenue has sent Russia into a new era defined by sustained budget deficits, higher taxes and stubborn inflation.\n\nRussia’s oil trade has been battered by two forces. Oil prices have declined since April, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to gradually increase production after years of cuts. The Russian oil industry has also been hit in recent months by new Western sanctions and the heavier enforcement of existing ones.\n\nIn October, President Trump imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft, which is state-owned, and Lukoil, which is private. Those penalties significantly undercut the companies’ ability to sell crude. Since then, Russia has also faced stepped-up enforcement of restrictions against the illicit “shadow fleet” of tankers it uses to ship oil.\n\nThis month, the U.S. military seized a Russian-flagged vessel in the North Atlantic that had been used to carry Venezuelan oil. The French Navy also intercepted a tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of using a false flag and belonging to a Russia-linked fleet.\n\nBecause of the current global oversupply, buyers now have more alternatives to Russian crude. This allows them to either walk away entirely or demand significantly higher discounts to compensate for the risk of handling goods hit with sanctions, said Sergey Vakulenko, an energy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n“Had it not been for this noticeable decrease in oil prices,” he said, “all these measures would have been far less effective.”\n\nDiscounts on Russian oil have grown drastically. The economy ministry said this month that the average price of Russian oil was $39 per barrel in December, down from more than $57 in August.\n\nAdding to Moscow’s problems, Ukraine has been using drones since November to strike Russia-linked tankers in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Ukrainian military has also been attacking Russian refineries. That has contributed to fuel crises in several regions, forcing the government to temporarily ban the export of oil products.\n\n“The only factor that can change the situation is economic pressure on Russia,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Friday. “Russia must run out of money for the war to start coming to an end.”\n\nThis is not the first time that Mr. Putin has dealt with a drop in oil prices. But in previous years, the Russian state had more options. It could cut expenditures or allow the currency to weaken to replenish the budget. But the costs of the war, which amount to about 30 percent of Russia’s $580 billion annual budget, make it hard to reduce expenses. And the currency, the ruble, has remained strong.\n\nPropped up by restrictions on imports and high interest rates, the ruble surged by about 45 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2025. A strong ruble means that the government receives less money for each barrel of crude that is sold.\n\nWith options dwindling, the Kremlin had little choice but to increase state debt as well as personal and corporate taxes. The Russian government also increased taxes on smaller enterprises like bakeries and shops, causing a rare uproar among owners.\n\nRussia’s budget deficit reached $72 billion in 2025, nominally the highest since 2009. Mr. Nadorshin, the economist, said he expected it to increase further this year.\n\n“The situation is becoming more complicated,” he said, “and it’s clear that the pace of this complication is, naturally, worrying.”",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The terms of a Russian commitment to U.S. President Donald Trump to temporarily halt its bombardment of Ukraine during one of the country's bleakest winters in years remained unclear Friday, as Ukrainians braced for even worse conditions to come next week.\n\nTrump said late Thursday that President Vladimir Putin had agreed to a temporary pause in targeting Kyiv and other places as the region experiences freezing temperatures that have brought widespread hardship to civilians.\n\n“I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week during this ... extraordinary cold,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. Putin has “agreed to that,” he said, without elaborating on when the request to the Russian leader was made.\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a query seeking clarity about the scope and timing of any limited pause.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed Friday that Trump “made a personal request” to Putin to stop targeting Kyiv until Feb. 1 “in order to create favorable conditions for negotiations.”\n\nThe mention of Feb. 1 was confusing since that is only two days away. Also, the cold weather is forecast to get much worse from Sunday, with temperatures dropping even further and making the time frame for a pause in attacks hard to understand.\n\nRussia has sought to deny Ukrainian civilians heat, light and running water over the course of the war, in a strategy that Ukrainian officials describe as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nAsked if Moscow agreed to Trump’s proposal, Peskov said, “Yes, of course.” But he refused to answer further questions about whether the agreement covered only energy infrastructure or all aerial strikes, and when the halt on strikes was supposed to start.\n\nRussia struck Ukrainian energy assets in several regions of Ukraine on Thursday but there were no strikes on those facilities overnight, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday.\n\nIn a post on social media, Zelenskyy also noted that Russia has turned its attention to targeting Ukrainian logistics networks and that Russian drones and missiles hit residential areas of Ukraine overnight, as they have most nights during the war.\n\nTrump framed Putin's acceptance as a concession. But Zelenskyy was skeptical as Russia’s invasion approaches its fourth anniversary on Feb. 24 with no sign that Moscow is willing to reach a peace settlement despite a U.S.-led push to end the fighting.\n\n“I do not believe that Russia wants to end the war. There is a great deal of evidence to the contrary,” Zelenskyy said Thursday. Ukraine is ready to halt its attacks on Russia’s energy infrastructure, including oil refineries, if Moscow also stops its bombardment of the Ukrainian power grid and other energy assets, he said.\n\nRussia fired 111 drones and one ballistic missile at Ukraine overnight, injuring at least three people, the Ukrainian Air Force said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that its air defenses overnight shot down 18 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions, as well as the illegally annexed Crimea and the Black Sea.\n\nForecasters say Kyiv, which recently endured severe power shortages, will see a brutally cold stretch starting Friday that is expected to last into next week. Temperatures in some areas will drop to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit), the State Emergency Service said.\n\nThe possibility of a respite in energy sector attacks was discussed at last weekend’s meeting in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, between envoys of Ukraine, Russia and the United States, Zelenskyy said, adding that he had agreed to adhere to a “reciprocal approach” on energy assaults.\n\n“If Russia does not strike us, we will … take corresponding steps,” he told reporters.\n\nFurther talks were expected on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, but that could change because of a spike in tensions between the United States and Iran.\n\nIt was unclear whether and how any partial truce might work amid ongoing wider fighting and mistrust between the two countries.\n\n“There is no ceasefire. There is no official agreement on a ceasefire, as is typically reached during negotiations,” Zelenskyy said. “There has been no direct dialogue and no direct agreements on this matter between us and Russia.”\n\nUkraine had originally proposed a limited energy ceasefire at talks in Saudi Arabia last year, Zelenskyy said, but it gained no traction.\n\nDisagreement over what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory, and Moscow’s demand for possession of territory it hasn’t captured, are a key issue holding up a peace deal, according to Zelenskyy.\n\n“We have repeatedly said that we are ready for compromises that lead to a real end to the war, but that are in no way related to changes to Ukraine’s territorial integrity,” Zelenskyy said. “The American side understands this and says that there is a compromise solution regarding a free economic zone.”\n\nUkraine demands control over such a zone, he said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "title": "Ukrainian Drone Strikes On Parked Russian Aircraft Seen In “Greatest Hits” Video",
    "description": "The Security Service of Ukraine claims that its drones struck at least 15 Russian aircraft on airfields last year.",
    "fullText": "As both sides in the war in Ukraine continue their campaigns of long-range drone attacks, the Ukrainian government’s internal security agency has released a compilation of strikes directed against Russian airbases. The video, published by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), records drone strikes against Russian military aircraft by its special forces unit, the “Alpha Group,” also known as “A” Special Operations Center.\n\nHere is the Ukrainian video, released by SBU Alfa unit, by the way. https://t.co/dM7FBC5Ntf pic.twitter.com/vbdMqFIHmK\n\n— Yaroslav Trofimov (@yarotrof) January 29, 2026\n\n“The enemy is used to feeling safe in the deep rear. But for the special forces of “Alpha,” distance has long ceased to matter,” the SBU wrote in a post accompanying the video on social media.\n\nThe footage shows several Russian aircraft being targeted, from the perspective of the attacking drones. It appears that most, if not all, of these strikes were previously claimed, and some have been previously seen in the form of video stills. But the end result is certainly impressive, presuming all of the targeted aircraft were damaged or destroyed — which is far from clear from these videos.\n\nThe SBU claims that the total value of the damage was more than $1 billion, although it’s far from clear how this was calculated, especially since some of the airframes in question are decades old and no longer in production. It’s also notable that the SBU figure includes damage inflicted on ammunition and fuel depots at the airfields in question.\n\nRegardless, the 15 aircraft claimed targeted by the SBU appear to comprise:\n\n11 fixed-wing combat aircraft: Su-30SM Flanker (two), Su-27 Flanker (two), Su-24 Fencer (perhaps as many as five), and MiG-31 Foxhound (two);\n\n3 helicopters: Mi-8 Hip, Mi-26 Halo, and Mi-28 Havoc (one each);\n\n1 transport aircraft: An-26 Curl.\n\nFrom what can be seen, the An-26 appears to have been damaged beyond repair, while one Su-24 seems to have had at least its tail section damaged; available satellite imagery may show a destroyed Su-24, but the quality of the imagery means that it can’t be determined for sure.\n\nThese aircraft were targeted at five different airfields, the SBU stated, without disclosing their exact locations.\n\nHowever, based on open-source analysis, it seems that the targeted bases included Belbek, Kirovskoye, Saky, and Simferopol, all in Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nMi-8MTV-5M attacked at Kirovskoye Air Base (45.166855, 35.192407). This is the one that was destroyed on 28 June 2025. https://t.co/kizTFk1EP6 pic.twitter.com/dlR9pp5xF1\n\n— The Military Watch (@MarcinRogowsk14) January 28, 2026\n\nThe growing threat of attacks like these on airbases has prompted Russia to build new hardened aircraft shelters and embark on additional construction to help shield aircraft from drone strikes and other indirect fire. This is part of a broader push by the Russian military to improve physical defenses at multiple airfields following the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe highlighted airfield raids in the video are part of a wider Ukrainian drone campaign carried out last year, in which the SBU also targeted Russian air defense systems, radar installations, and critical energy infrastructure.\n\nAs far as air defense systems are concerned, the SBU claims that it destroyed Russian equipment worth an estimated $4 billion last year. These included S-300, S-350, and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, as well as advanced radar systems such as the Nebo-M, Podlet, and Protivnik-GE.\n\nIn 2025, Ukraine also carried out the spectacular Operation Spiderweb, a large-scale Ukrainian drone strike against airbases across Russia in June. This targeted Moscow’s fleet of strategic bombers and saw a reported 117 drones launched against at least four airfields.\n\nNotable also is the fact that the specific Ukrainian campaign against Russian airfields is something that was brought up by U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, last summer. The timing of that call suggests that Operation Spiderweb prompted that discussion.\n\nLots of people are reposting this Trump Truth Social post as if it’s recent (in part because Ukraine just released another video of hitting parked Russian warplanes), but it is in fact from last summer. pic.twitter.com/8jodT8bm7H\n\n— Yaroslav Trofimov (@yarotrof) January 29, 2026\n\nUkraine’s ability to strike high-value Russian targets at considerable range has been bolstered through the addition of long-range cruise missiles, as well as an expanding inventory of attack drones, both large and small.\n\nMeanwhile, SBU is continuing its long-range drone strikes.\n\nOvernight on January 13, the security agency teamed up with the Ukrainian Navy to attack a drone production facility in Taganrog, where several production halls appear to have been destroyed, based on satellite analysis.\n\nUkrainian Defenders destroyed several warehouses of Atlant Aero plant in Taganrog, Russia. Combat drones and their parts were produced there.\n\nGlory! pic.twitter.com/P6RcfpXtbl\n\n— Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) January 16, 2026\n\nThe facility in question, the Atlant Aero factory, is responsible, among others, for producing Russia’s Molniya loitering munition, widely used in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly hit a Russian drone factory in the city of Taganrog tonight, setting it ablaze. \n\nMultiple explosions were reported at the Atlant drone company, manufacturer of the Molniya-series attack drones. pic.twitter.com/yr3SA3b7gV\n\n— OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) January 13, 2026\n\nDrones being used to strike enemy facilities producing drones is very much indicative of the path the war has taken, when it comes to the increasing use and diversity of uncrewed systems across all fronts.\n\nFor its part, Russia employed a BM-35 loitering munition to attack what was claimed by some observers to be a Ukrainian F-16 fighter at Kanatove Air Base in Ukraine’s Kirovohrad region, on January 26. In fact, the target was either a decoy or a ground-instructional aid, something that even Russia’s Rubicon Drone Operations Center attested to.\n\nRussian BM-35 kamikaze drone with Starlink hits Ukrainain F-16 decoy at Kanatove airfield, Kirovohrad region. pic.twitter.com/LpQyXUlvPZ\n\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) January 29, 2026\n\nThis is not the first time that a Russian drone strike has claimed a Ukrainian aircraft mock-up, but again demonstrates the potential vulnerability of airfields to these kinds of attacks.\n\nNotably, too, the BM-35 drone used in the strike is reported to use satellite connectivity via Starlink, allowing operators to control it in real time over long distances.\n\nThe SBU’s latest ‘greatest hits’ compilation underscores how drone attacks on Russian military aircraft are one of its highest priorities and one that we will certainly see targeted again in the months to come.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

Musk turned on Starlink service over Ukraine in 2022 ‍after Kyiv pleaded for help in the first days following Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nDespite Musk's subsequent clashes with Ukrainian officials over his views on the war, Ukraine's military still relies on tens of thousands of Starlinks for battlefield communication and for piloting ​some drone missions.\n\nThey are favoured for their stable connection on the battlefield and for their resistance to ‌enemy signal jamming.\n\nIn a social media post in February 2024, SpaceX said it does not sell or ship Starlink to Russia, and \"does not do business of any kind with the Russian Government or its military\".\n\nThe U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said it had seen reports of Russia using Starlink-equipped Shahed long-range drones beginning in September 2024.\n\n'HUNDREDS' OF STARLINK-EQUIPPED DRONES\n\nSerhiy Beskrestnov, a newly appointed adviser to Fedorov, drew attention to the issue ⁠over the past week by posting pictures on social media ​of the wreckage of long-range Russian drones, including Shaheds, with Starlink ​terminals.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beskrestnov said that Shahed drones manually flown by pilots, possibly through Starlink, had attacked a passenger train in northeastern Ukraine. That attack killed five people, and was denounced ‍by Kyiv as an act ⁠of terrorism.\n\nOn Thursday, Beskrestnov said there had been \"hundreds\" of cases where Starlink-enabled Russian drones had attacked Ukraine.\n\n\"The complexity of this process lies in the fact that Starlink cannot be suppressed by means of ⁠electronic warfare, and even their position in flight cannot be detected by reconnaissance equipment,\" he wrote, adding that the way to solve ‌the issue was therefore through SpaceX.",

    "description": "A new report warns that the number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could hit 2 million by the spring, with Russia suffering the largest number of troop deaths recorded for any major power in any conflict since World War II.  Tuesday's report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A new report warns that the number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could hit 2 million by the spring, with Russia suffering the largest number of troop deaths recorded for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nTuesday's report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nAs the war grinds through another bitterly cold winter, Russian strikes hit an apartment block Wednesday on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing two people. Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe CSIS report said Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025.\n\n“Despite claims of battlefield momentum in Ukraine, the data shows that Russia is paying an extraordinary price for minimal gains and is in decline as a major power,” the report said. “No major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II.\"\n\nIt estimated that Ukraine, with its smaller army and population, had suffered between 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each side seeks to amplify the other side’s casualties.\n\nCommenting on the report, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the research could not be considered “reliable information” and that only Russia’s Ministry of Defense was authorized to provide information on military losses.\n\nThe ministry’s last statement on battlefield deaths was in September 2022, when it said that just under 6,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. It has not released any updated figures since then.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn an interview with NBC in February 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the war began.\n\nThe report estimated that at current rates, combined Russian and Ukrainian casualties may be as high as 1.8 million and could reach 2 million by spring.\n\nThe figures from the CSIS were compiled using the Washington, D.C.-based think tank’s own analysis, data published by independent Russian news site Mediazona with the BBC, estimates by the British government and interviews with state officials.\n\nReports about military losses have been repressed in Russian media, activists and independent journalists say.\n\nMediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, has so far collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed by scouring news reports, social media and government websites.\n\nThe report also said that Russian forces were advancing at a sluggish pace since they seized the initiative on the battlefield in 2024, despite their much larger size.\n\nRussia’s advance in Ukraine has largely settled into a grinding war of attrition, and analysts say that Russian President Vladimir Putin is in no rush to find a settlement, despite his army’s difficulties on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.\n\nThe report said Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters (49 to 230 feet) per day in their most prominent offensives.\n\nThat is “slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century,” the report said.\n\nPutin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure — 617,000 — in December 2023. It was not possible to verify those figures.\n\n2 killed in attack in Kyiv region\n\nOfficials said Wednesday that two people were killed near the Ukrainian capital and at least nine others were injured in attacks across Ukraine.\n\nA man and a woman died in an overnight attack in the Bilohorodka area on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to Mykola Kalashnyk, head of the regional military administration.\n\nOfficials in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih, as well as the Zaporizhzhia region, also reported Russian strikes overnight, wounding at least nine people and damaging infrastructure.\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia attacked overnight with one ballistic missile and 146 strike drones, 103 of which were shot down or destroyed using electronic warfare.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense said its air defenses destroyed 75 Ukrainian drones overnight. Twenty-four were shot down over Russia’s southwestern Krasnodar region, with 23 more shot down over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2016.\n\nTwo drones were reportedly shot down over Russia's Voronezh region, where Ukraine's General Staff said Wednesday that it had struck the Khokholskaya oil depot. Regional Gov. Alexander Gusev wrote on Telegram that falling drone debris sparked a fire involving oil products, but did not give further details.",

    "title": "Ukrainian drone schools say there's little the West can teach them about fighting a drone war",
    "description": "Ukraine's drone schools are closely following the fast-developing drone battle and say their expertise only comes from Ukrainians, not Western allies.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian drone schools say that Western militaries have little to offer them when it comes to training drone operators to fight Russia. Western armies know war, tactics, and combat power, but Ukraine has significant experience in novel elements of modern drone warfare learned over years of hard fighting.\n\nDrones of all kinds are used \n\nWhile drones are not new to Western militaries, they have never been used or adapted at this scale or speed. Facing an existential adapt-or-die situation, Ukraine is writing its own lessons.\n\nUkraine has a host of drone schools that have designed curricula to make the country's operators as effective as possible. And officials at three of them told Business Insider that their lessons are only informed by Ukrainian experiences.\n\n\"As of today, we do not receive any particularly useful information from our allies regarding the use of drones,\" other than training on any equipment that allies provide, one said.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that said 100% of his school's teachings come from feedback or information from soldiers who are in the field.\n\nOne example he gave was in stopping enemy drones: \"All experience in striking down drones is based only on the experience of the Ukrainian Defense Forces.\"\n\nHe said there isn't time for theoretical tactics that may not work when needed most. \"We are in a situation where we need to respond quickly to new drones and the tactics of their use by the enemy,\" he said. \"Accordingly, techniques are being tested in practice, and only those techniques that really work are being retained.\"\n\nAnother drone school, Dronarium, said the school's training \"is based on existing combat experience, which changes very rapidly.\"\n\nBecause of that pace, instructors said Ukraine is often better positioned to share lessons than to receive them. \"In this sense, at the moment it is rather us who can share valuable information with them, rather than our foreign partners sharing it with us,\" Anastasia Sobova, Dronarium Academy's chief business development officer, told BI.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have been receiving Western training throughout the war, with mixed feedback. Some has been well received, while other elements have been deemed irrelevant to the kind of fighting Ukraine faces now.\n\nUkraine's troops say combat tactics can become out of date in a matter of only weeks; the drone war is no different.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of the US arm of DroneShield, a company making counter-drone systems for the US and Europe, recently told Business Insider that the speed of battlefield changes has shifted weapon development cycles from months and years to weeks.\n\nThings change so fast on the battlefield that the schools need to frequently rewrite their lessons, sometimes as fast as every other week.\n\nThese drone schools stay on top of changes by sending their instructors to the front, maintaining constant contact with program graduates and other soldiers who send updates from the battlefield, and testing new technology.\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, said that his school's graduates exchange messages with the school to share new information about what's happening on the battlefield or get advice from teachers.\n\n\"Cadets go to the front line, type questions in those chats, or provide information about new enemy tactics.\" The information they get from those on the front line goes into the teaching for the next groups.\n\nPervak said in his school, \"We constantly update our instructors' knowledge. Some instructors occasionally visit combat units of the UAV to see firsthand what has changed, what remains relevant, and what can be discarded.\"\n\nMany Western militaries, including the US, acknowledge they are behind on drone warfare and that their tactics need updating. It is an area where Ukraine is helping partner nations that have assisted it in its defense.\n\nWestern and NATO militaries are closely watching the war, concerned that Russia could threaten Europe and that drones would play a major role in any wider conflict. That worry has intensified efforts to learn from Ukraine's experience, particularly in drone operations and counter-drone tactics. The Ukrainians are attempting to meet that demand for expertise.\n\nUkraine agreed to help Poland with drone warfare training and has helped train Norway's drone operators.\n\nUkrainian military specialists traveled to Denmark to participate in counter-drone exercises. Copenhagen said in April it intended to send unarmed soldiers to Ukraine for drone warfare training, though it is unclear if that has taken place.\n\nThe UK says Ukraine has influenced its drone doctrine as well. Britain leads an international effort to train Ukrainian troops, known as Operation Interflex, and those Ukrainian soldiers often arrive with more real-world drone experience than their trainers.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the UK's Irish Guards, told Business Insider that one surprise from the training was \"how much we would learn.\" His unit now trains in drone warfare and 3D printing drone parts based on Ukrainian lessons.\n\nPervak described sharing expertise as a way to repay allies for their support. \"Not forgetting the fact that we are truly grateful for the remarkable support from our allies, it is time now to share our latest battlefield experience.\"\n\nDrones might not dominate a NATO war against Russia to the same extent they do in Ukraine — in part because Western militaries possess capabilities Ukraine lacks — but they are no longer viewed as a niche tool. Ukraine's experience has led to a realization that this tech may very well be the future of warfare.",

    "description": "In a major shift for Ukraine's military, Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko are now officially advising Kyiv on defense tech and drones.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, has appointed two prominent Telegram bloggers and activists to his \"team of new leaders,\" saying they will advise him on defense technology and drone warfare.\n\nThe move is a major recognition for the pair — Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko — who are among the most influential voices among the volunteers filling vital gaps in logistics and drone expertise for Ukraine's battered military.\n\nBeskrestnov, widely cited among Ukrainians as an expert on drones, runs a Telegram channel with some 156,000 followers, where he publicly analyzes Russian and Ukrainian battle drones and how they've performed.\n\nFedorov named him an advisor in defense technology on Sunday, saying Beskrestnov would focus on helping Ukraine build counter-systems for Russian strike and reconnaissance drones.\n\nIn his statement, Fedorov said that Beskrestnov would also support Ukraine's military in analyzing Russian tech, studying \"logistics, study of enemy solutions, and leveraging this experience to our advantage.\"\n\nSternenko, a political activist who now runs an organization that raises funds for military drones, was appointed as Fedorov's advisor on Thursday.\n\n\"From now on, Serhii will act as my advisor on enhancing the use of UAVs at the frontline. His experience will help us implement our shared vision of improving the effectiveness of units operating unmanned systems,\" Fedorov said.\n\nThe Sternenko Foundation serves as a hub for drone procurement, raising money to buy specialized first-person-view drones for military units that demonstrate they're combat-effective.\n\nAs of Monday, it says it has delivered over 256,000 drones on demand to Ukrainian units.\n\nFedorov, Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister at 35, previously was the country's minister for digital transformation. Since being confirmed to his new role earlier this month, he's pledged to revitalize Ukraine's military, promising to reform its training programs, internal culture, and organizational doctrine.\n\nAppointing Sternenko and Beskrestnov as advisors is a significant change in how Kyiv treats its grassroots movements. These groups work closely with Ukrainian forces, but top authorities have generally been slow to officially recognize or integrate them.\n\nSeveral frontline units previously told Business Insider that they sometimes rely on the Sternenko Foundation, for example, for drones that can effectively cope with Russian electronic warfare. While the Ukrainian military provides its fighters with drones in bulk, these sometimes need further tweaks as the battlefield evolves rapidly.\n\nVolunteer foundations often step in and have become known for their speed, leveraging connections with drone manufacturers and informal logistics networks to deliver priority supplies, vehicles, and modified drones within hours or days.\n\nFedorov said that Sternenko would particularly assist in establishing basic support for drone units, adding that 50 of Ukraine's 400 units account for 70% of its battlefield engagements.\n\n\"The objective is to enable the other 350 units to grow quickly and significantly increase the scale of destroying Russian forces,\" Fedorov said.\n\nBeskrestnov, meanwhile, regularly publicizes news about Russia's Shahed-type drones. He often posts footage from found wreckage to show how the Kremlin has been modifying or upgrading the loitering munitions.\n\nFedorov's team credited the drone analyst for being the \"first to report on the use by Russians of FPV drones equipped with machine vision, as well as the use of jet-powered Shahed drones.\"\n\nThe new defense minister's attempt to reshape Ukraine's military comes as it grapples with a slew of challenges, including heightened fighting intensity on the front lines in recent months and a withdrawal of most US miliary support.\n\nIn his opening speech to Ukraine's parliament, Fedorov said the country was facing a high rate of desertion and draft dodging, and that the military's budget had shrunk since last year.",

    "fullText": "For average wage earners in Russia, it's a big payday. For criminals seeking to escape the harsh conditions and abuse in prison, it's a chance at freedom. For immigrants hoping for a better life, it's a simplified path to citizenship.\n\nAll they have to do is sign a contract to fight in Ukraine.\n\nAs Russia seeks to replenish its forces in nearly four years of war — and avoid an unpopular nationwide mobilization — it's pulling out all the stops to find new troops to send into the battlefield.\n\nSome come from abroad to fight in what has become a bloody war of attrition. After signing a mutual defense treaty with Moscow in 2024, North Korea sent thousands of soldiers to help Russia defend its Kursk region from a Ukrainian incursion.\n\nMen from South Asian countries, including India, Nepal and Bangladesh, complain of being duped into signing up to fight by recruiters promising jobs. Officials in Kenya, South Africa and Iraq say the same has happened to citizens from their countries.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure – 617,000 – in December 2023. It's unclear if those numbers are accurate.\n\nStill hidden are the numbers of military casualties, with Moscow having released limited official figures. The British Defense Ministry said last summer that more than 1 million Russian troops may have been killed or wounded.\n\nIndependent Russian news site Mediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, scoured news reports, social media and government websites and collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed. More than 550 of those were foreigners from over two dozen countries.\n\nUnlike Ukraine, where martial law and nationwide mobilization has been in place since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Putin has resisted ordering a broad call-up.\n\nWhen a limited mobilization of 300,000 men was tried later that year, tens of thousands of people fled abroad. The effort stopped after a few weeks when the target was met, but a Putin decree left the door open for another call-up. It also made all military contracts effectively open-ended and barred soldiers from quitting service or being discharged, unless they reached certain age limits or were incapacitated by injuries.\n\nSince then, Moscow has largely relied on what it describes as voluntary enlistment.\n\nThe flow of voluntary enlistees signing military contracts has remained strong, topping 400,000 last year, Putin said in December. It was not possible to independently verify the claim. Similar numbers were announced in 2024 and 2023.\n\nActivists say these contracts often stipulate a fixed term of service, such as one year, leading some potential enlistees to believe the commitment is temporary. But contracts are automatically extended indefinitely, they say.\n\nThe government offers high pay and extensive benefits to enlistees. Regional authorities offer various enlistment bonuses, sometimes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nIn the Khanty-Mansi region of central Russia, for example, an enlistee would get about $50,000 in various bonuses, according to the local government. That's more than twice the average annual income in the region, where monthly salaries in the first 10 months of 2025 were reported to be just over $1,600.\n\nThere also are tax breaks, debt relief and other perks.\n\nDespite Kremlin claims of relying on voluntary enlistment, media reports and rights groups say conscripts — men aged 18-30 performing fixed-term mandatory military service and exempted from being sent to Ukraine — are often coerced by superiors into signing contracts that send them into battle.\n\nRecruitment also extends to prisoners and those in pretrial detention centers, a practice led early in the war by the late mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin and adopted by the Defense Ministry. Laws now allow recruitment of both convicts and suspects in criminal cases.\n\nForeigners also are recruiting targets, both inside Russia and abroad.\n\nLaws were adopted offering accelerated Russian citizenship for enlistees. Russian media and activists also report that raids in areas where migrants typically live or work lead to them being pressuring into military service, with new citizens sent to enlistment offices to determine if they’re eligible for mandatory service.\n\nIn November, Putin decreed that military service was mandatory for certain foreigners seeking permanent residency.\n\nSome reportedly are lured to Russia by trafficking rings promising jobs, then duping them into signing military contracts. Cuban authorities in 2023 identified and sought to dismantle one such ring operating from Russia.\n\nNepal’s Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud told The Associated Press in 2024 that his country asked Russia to return hundreds of Nepali nationals who were recruited to fight in Ukraine, as well as to repatriate the remains of those killed in the war. Nepal has since barred citizens from traveling to Russia or Ukraine for work, citing recruitment efforts.\n\nAlso in 2024, India’s federal investigation agency said it broke up a network that lured at least 35 of its citizens to Russia under the pretext of employment. The men were trained for combat and deployed to Ukraine against their will, with some \"grievously injured,” the agency said.\n\nWhen Putin hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks in 2024, New Delhi said its nationals who were “misled” into joining the Russian army would be discharged.\n\nIraqi officials say about 5,000 of its citizens have joined the Russian military along with an unspecified number who are fighting alongside Ukrainian forces. Officials in Baghdad cracked down on such recruiting networks, with one man convicted last year of human trafficking and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAn unknown number of Iraqis have been killed or gone missing while fighting in Ukraine. Some families have reported that relatives were lured to Russia under false pretenses and forced to enlist; in other cases, Iraqis have joined voluntarily for the salary and Russian citizenship.\n\nForeigners duped into fighting are especially vulnerable because they don’t speak Russian, have no military experience and are deemed “dispensable, to put it bluntly,” by military commanders, said Anton Gorbatsevich of the activist group Idite Lesom, or “Get Lost,” which helps men desert from the army.\n\nThis month, a Ukrainian agency for the treatment of prisoners of war said over 18,000 foreign nationals had fought or are fighting on the Russian side. Almost 3,400 have been killed, and hundreds of citizens of 40 countries are held in Ukraine as POWs.\n\nIf true, that represents a fraction of the 700,000 troops that Putin said are fighting for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nUsing foreigners is only one way to meet the constant demand, said Artyom Klyga, head of the legal department at the Movement of Conscientious Objectors, noting Russian recruitment efforts appear to be stable. Most of those seeking help from the group, which assists men in avoiding military service, are Russian citizens, he said.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, a Russia researcher at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, said the Kremlin has gotten more “creative” in the last two years with attracting enlistees, including foreigners.\n\nBut recruitment efforts are becoming “extremely expensive” for Russia, which faces a slowing economy, she added.",

    "description": "Russia has admitted for the first time that a Ukrainian missile sank its prized Black Sea flagship, later deleting the statement and returning to the official narrative that the guided-missile cruiser Moskva went down because of a freak accident.",
    "fullText": "Russia has admitted for the first time that a Ukrainian missile sank its prized Black Sea flagship, later deleting the statement and returning to the official narrative that the guided-missile cruiser Moskva went down because of a freak accident.\n\nThe Moskva was one of Russia’s most important warships when it sunk in April 2022, just seven weeks after Moscow launched its unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKyiv was quick to claim it had hit the vessel with its Neptune anti-ship cruise missile, but Russia pushed a different narrative of the incident.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense always insisted the Moskva sank after a fire broke out and caused munitions aboard to explode. The Russian military said at the time that the crew of the warship was evacuated, although it later admitted some were missing.\n\nAccording to an independent Russian news outlet Mediazona, a military court in Moscow last week inadvertently corrected the Kremlin’s official narrative. The court, Mediazona said, issued a statement about the sentencing of a Ukrainian navy commander who ordered strikes against the Moskva and another ship, the Admiral Essen frigate. According to the court, he was sentenced to life in prison in absentia.\n\nThe statement was quickly wiped off the court’s website, but not before Mediazona managed to download it.\n\nThe loss of the Moskva was extremely embarrassing for Russia, marking one of Ukraine’s most significant wins of the war so far.\n\nCNN asked Russian authorities about the apparent backtracking. Irina Zhirnova, the spokesperson for the 2nd Western District Military Court, which would have issued the now-deleted statement, said there would be no comment. The Russian military did not respond to CNN’s request.\n\nMediazona has reported on the circumstances of the Moskva sinking extensively in the past, publishing testimonies from the families of sailors who were killed – and whose deaths were never officially acknowledged by the Russian military.\n\n“On April 13, 2022, a missile strike with two missiles hit the Guards missile cruiser Moskva, causing a fire and smoke filling the ship’s interior,” the court said in the statement, according to Mediazona.\n\n“The explosion, fire, and smoke killed 20 of the cruiser’s crew, 24 suffered injuries of varying severity, and eight were missing, including during the over six-hour battle for the ship’s survival,” the statement said, according to Mediazona, adding that the ship was “not involved” in Russia’s operation in Ukraine.\n\nAsked by CNN for a comment, Dmytro Pletenchuk, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s Naval Forces, said it was difficult for Russia to deny the facts of the sinking, especially since the families of the Moskva’s crew have been speaking out.\n\nThe backtracking on the statement by the court is just the latest propaganda fail by Russian authorities.\n\nIn the early days of the invasion, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti published, and then quickly removed, an editorial prematurely celebrating Russia’s victory in the war. Nearly four years later, Russian forces continue to grind along the front lines achieving incremental territorial gains at an extremely high cost, while Ukraine has managed to retake vast areas that Moscow initially invaded.\n\nThe Russian military and the Kremlin have exercised an extremely tight control over the narrative around Russia’s war on Ukraine – even refusing to call the conflict a “war” and referring to it instead as Russia’s “special military operation.”\n\nNumerous journalists who have reported on the facts of the ground, including documenting massacres committed by Russian soldiers in Bucha and elsewhere, have been jailed for spreading “false information” about the Russian army.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists said in December that at least 27 journalist had been imprisoned on criminal charges related to their reporting since Russia launched the full-scale invasion. The committee said that four have been released, two exiled and one killed. The rest are still in prison.",

Using elite strike crews for short-range suppression could also be a sign of heightened pressure on Ukrainian lines.\n\nThe Unmanned Systems Forces is a relatively new elite formation in Ukraine that focuses on providing strike or reconnaissance support with smaller drones. Madyar, a prominent drone unit commander appointed to lead the group in June 2025, said on Sunday that his branch comprises 12 combat crews who are present on 30% of the front line.\n\nRussia relies on ground infantry assaults to gradually take territory in Ukraine, and has been aggressively attempting to advance along some key frontline areas in recent months.\n\nMadyar wrote that his units are assigned to corps commanders, who have been deploying the operators to attack such advancing troops at closer range.\n\n\"Not a single Corps commander, who has many hundreds of crews from their own brigades and subordinate units within their area of responsibility, is ready to release SBS work to proper depth,\" Madyar wrote, referring to the Unmanned Systems Forces as the SBS.\n\nHe added that this was due to Ukrainian commanders wanting to protect their troops in the trenches.\n\nFor Ukrainian soldiers, being sent to hold a trench is one of the war's most high-casualty tasks. They're often outnumbered by waves of attacking Russian troops, and typically need the help of friendly drone pilots to thwart assaults before they can get close.\n\nBut ideally, these drone operators try to spot and engage enemy infantry farther away, roughly 6 to 10 miles from the line of contact, as these troops form up or begin to launch assaults.\n\n\"To systematically reach proper depth, it is necessary to manage to create new crews, at least three times more than the current number,\" Madyar wrote. \"The existing ones, for the most part, will remain in tactical depth.\"\n\nMadyar also said infantry strikes have recently accounted for a larger share of his units' time.\n\nAccording to him, the SBS has a usual goal of targeting infantry in 30% of its strikes, but nearly 40% of its successful attacks in December were against infantry, involving roughly 12,000 Russian soldiers.\n\nStill, the commander wrote that in the SBS' entire history, the majority of its engagements have been against Russian equipment and logistics routes, at ranges of roughly 2.3 miles to 9.2 miles, depending on the type of system targeted.\n\nMadyar's branch has struck over 1,200 \"launch points\" for Russian drone pilots, at an average depth of 2.25 miles, he added.\n\nElite drone units typically make a name for themselves by using small, inexpensive drones to strike priority air defense systems, logistics routes, or command posts deep behind enemy lines.\n\nIndeed, Madyar had posted his statement on Sunday in response to what he said were recent criticisms that his units were focusing too much on strikes against Russian soldiers.\n\nMadyar also wrote that not all SBS crews are equally contributing to these strike statistics.\n\n\"Only six to seven out of 12 SBS units are working at the desired pace; the others are catching up and need more time,\" his statement said.",

    "fullText": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that a U.S. security guarantees document for Ukraine is “100% ready” after two days of talks involving representatives from Ukraine, the U.S. and Russia.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Vilnius during a visit to Lithuania, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is waiting for its partners to set a signing date, after which the document would go to the U.S. Congress and Ukrainian parliament for ratification.\n\nZelenskyy also emphasized Ukraine’s push for European Union membership by 2027, calling it an “economic security guarantee.”\n\nThe Ukrainian leader described the talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, as likely the first trilateral format in “quite a long while” that included not only diplomats but military representatives from all three sides. The talks, which began on Friday and continued Saturday, were the latest aiming to end Russia’s nearly four-year full-scale invasion.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged fundamental differences between Ukrainian and Russian positions, reaffirming territorial issues as a major sticking point.\n\n“Our position regarding our territory — Ukraine’s territorial integrity — must be respected,” he said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin discussed a Ukraine settlement with U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner during marathon talks late Thursday. The Kremlin insisted that to reach a peace deal, Kyiv must withdraw its troops from the areas in the east that Russia illegally annexed but has not fully captured.\n\nZelenskyy said the U.S. is trying to find a compromise, but that “all sides must be ready for compromise.”\n\nNegotiators will return to the UAE on Feb. 1 for the next round of talks, according to a U.S. official. The recent talks covered a broad range of military and economic matters and included the possibility of a ceasefire before a deal, the official said. There was not yet an agreement on a final framework for oversight and operation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russia and is the largest in Europe.",

Many residents' apartments were already freezing cold from disruption to the ‌city's centralised heat distribution system following previous attacks.\n\nMoscow carried out the strikes as trilateral, U.S.-brokered talks between Russia and Ukraine continued into a second day in the UAE, with no sign of compromise on Friday.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said one person was killed in the capital city and four injured, including three being treated ⁠in hospital, while 19 people including ‌a child were wounded in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv.\n\nRussia, which has pummelled Ukraine's power grid since its full-scale invasion in 2022, is conducting its heaviest bombardment campaign ‍on energy facilities this winter, leaving people across Ukraine with only a few hours of power a day and some without heat or water.\n\nOver 800,000 people in the capital and another 400,000 in the northern region of Chernihiv ​were without power after the latest attacks, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said.\n\nUkraine's air force said ‌Russia had unleashed 375 drones and 21 missiles, including two of its rarely deployed Tsirkon ballistic missiles, in its overnight attack.\n\nThe sky over Kyiv was lit up by regular orange flashes as air defences fired on missiles and drones descending on the capital, with loud booms echoing around the city's tall buildings.\n\nTymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, reported strikes in at least four districts. A medical facility was ⁠among the buildings damaged.\n\nBefore Saturday, Kyiv had already endured two ​mass overnight attacks since the New Year that have knocked ​out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings.\n\nEmergency workers were still engaged in restoring services to residents that had been knocked out by those attacks, and Klitschko said ‍many of the buildings ⁠that had lost heating on Saturday had only recently had it restored.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a frequent target 30 km (18 miles) from the Russian border and much closer to eastern battlefronts, Mayor Ihor ⁠Terekhov said 25 drones had hit several districts.\n\nWriting on Telegram, Terekhov said the drones had struck a dormitory for displaced people ‌and two medical facilities including a maternity hospital.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Lai Ching-te on Friday offered talks with Ukraine to crack down on sanctions-busting after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy name-checked ​the island as a source of illicit missile components.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in ‌2022, semiconductor powerhouse Taiwan has successively updated export controls to stop high-tech goods being used for military purposes, and ‌has joined wide-ranging Western-led sanctions against Moscow.\n\nSpeaking in Davos on Thursday, Zelenskiy said Russia would not be able to produce missiles without \"critical components sourced from China, Europe, the United States, and Taiwan\", according to excerpts published on his website.\n\nResponding on his X account in English, Lai said Taiwan has ⁠long worked with global partners to \"staunchly ‌support Ukraine through humanitarian aid & coordinated sanctions\".\n\n\"We welcome further exchanges of information with President @ZelenskyyUa to further clamp down on illegal 3rd country transshipment & concealed ‍end-use,\" he said, posting a picture of orchids in the colours of Ukraine's flag.\n\nLai said young Taiwanese volunteer soldiers had died fighting against Russia.\n\n\"We remain clear: any assistance to the aggressor or ​violations of int'l embargoes & export control regulations are unacceptable. We pray for peace to be ‌restored to Ukraine soon.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters later, Lai said he hoped Zelenskiy would pass any information to Taiwan about sanctions busting:\n\n\"We are willing to strengthen controls on goods that are routed through third countries while concealing their final destination, to prevent them from entering Russia and to protect Ukraine.\"\n\nUkraine's presidential office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTaiwan's economy ministry said ⁠no chips or machine tools had been exported to ​Russia since April 2024, and the government would prevent ​relevant components from going to Russia.\n\nIn November, Taiwan said it was revising export controls to comply with the Wassenaar Arrangement, an international agreement aimed at preventing ‍weapons proliferation.\n\nWhile senior Taiwan ⁠officials have spoken directly with some Ukrainian city mayors, there has been no publicly acknowledged direct contact between the two governments.\n\nLike most countries, Ukraine has formal diplomatic relations ⁠only with Beijing, not Taipei.\n\nTaiwan has compared the Russian invasion of Ukraine to China's military threat against an island ‌it claims as its own. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.",

    "description": "Mykhailo Fedorov, the country's new defense minister, said his troops are already inflicting 35,000 battlefield kills a month. He wants more.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's new defense minister has set a new goal for its forces to kill 50,000 Russian troops a month, a sharp increase from the losses that Kyiv says it's inflicting on the Kremlin now.\n\nIn a meeting with reporters on Tuesday, Mykhailo Fedorov said the new figure would be a core \"strategic objective\" for Ukraine.\n\n\"The objective is to impose costs on Russia that it cannot bear. In this way to force peace through strength,\" Fedorov said.\n\nNotably, he specified only battlefield fatalities.\n\nThe new standard comes as Russia intensified its offensive in some areas of the front lines last year, aiming to take key cities such as Pokrovsk. The nature of its operations — often reliant on continuous high-casualty infantry attacks — has led to political discussion in recent months that the Kremlin may soon reach a point where it will lose more soldiers than it can recruit.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in December that his forces had, for the first time, killed and wounded more Russian soldiers in one month than the Kremlin had called up for the same time period.\n\nFedorov, who was confirmed in his role last week, said on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops are already documenting 35,000 kills every month via video.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte cited another figure while speaking in Brussels on January 16, saying that 20,000 to 25,000 Russian troops were dying every month.\n\nWhile differing significantly, both figures indicate that Russia is fighting the war at a high cost.\n\nRutte said the death rate has become \"unsustainable\" for Russia, and drew comparisons to the Soviet Union's losses during the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, when an estimated 15,000 Soviet troops died every month over nine years.\n\nLikewise, Fedorov expressed hopes that ramping up a focus on lethality will exhaust Russia's war machine.\n\n\"If we reach the figure of 50,000, we will see what happens to the enemy. They treat people as a resource, and problems with that resource are already obvious,\" he said.\n\nRussia does not disclose how many of its troops are wounded or killed during the war. However, international and Ukrainian analyses say the number is likely tracking past 1 million people over nearly four years of war.\n\nThe UK's defense ministry said in early January that the Kremlin may have suffered at least 1.2 million total casualties, which includes both wounded and deceased, since February 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin has relied largely on hefty sign-up bonuses to attract local contract soldiers, though it's also been found to sustain troop levels through other means, such as by recruiting from prisons or hiring foreigners via informal channels.\n\nSome of those strategies may be waning. On Tuesday, the Russian independent media outlet Vertska reported that contract soldier sign-ups were slowing in some areas of the country.\n\nData from an unnamed source in the Moscow mayor's office, it wrote, showed that the capital had seen a roughly 25% annual drop in recruitment in 2025.\n\nIt's unclear how Fedorov intends to specifically target increasing combat kills. He said in his opening remarks to Ukrainian lawmakers last week that he intended to divert more staffing to drone units. Drones are thought to be responsible for roughly 70 to 90% of casualties inflicted during the war.\n\nHis new objective also comes against the backdrop of the US attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. Many of the Kremlin's latest war actions, such as attempts to take Pokrovsk, have been seen in Ukraine as efforts to posture into a position of strength.\n\nAt 32, Fedorov is Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister. He's begun his new appointment with promises of aggressive reform of the military's structure and how it distributes resources to its fighters.\n\nFedorov was previously Ukraine's minister for digital transformation.",

    "description": "Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper says the Russian president has shown no commitment to peace in Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the UK will not yet be signing up to US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace over concerns about Russian leader Vladimir Putin's possible participation.\n\nCooper told the BBC the UK had been invited to join the board but \"won't be one of the signatories today\" at a ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nThe board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.\n\nCooper described the board as a \"legal treaty that raises much broader issues\" than the initiative's initial focus on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe charter proposed by the White House does not mention the Palestinian territory and critics say the board appears to be designed to replace some functions of the United Nations.\n\nSome of the US's traditional allies have not agreed to join the board and notably, none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far.\n\nThe UN Security Council has been the main international platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution since the end of World War Two.\n\nBut launching the board at a signing ceremony alongside world leaders in Davos, Trump said he did not intend it as a replacement for the UN and expressed his belief that it would help forge an \"everlasting\" peace in the Middle East.\n\nTrump said the board had the chance to be \"one of the most consequential bodies ever created\".\n\n\"We're committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,\" Trump said. \"It's going to be a great plan and this is where the board of peace started.\"\n\nTrump said once the board had been completely formed, \"we can do pretty much whatever we want to do\".\n\n\"But we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,\" he added.\n\nPresident Trump was joined by the leaders and representatives of 19 countries for the Board of Peace signing ceremony, including Argentina, Hungary, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n\nPresident Trump also said Putin had accepted an invitation to join the initiative.\n\nBut the Russian president has not confirmed this and earlier he said his country was still studying the invitation.\n\nPutin said the idea of using Russian assets frozen in the US as a contribution to the board would be discussed at a meeting with representatives of the Trump administration later on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nLive: World leaders sign Trump's Board of Peace papers\n\nTrump to meet Zelensky as US envoy says ending war with Russia down to one issue\n\nPutin invited to join US-led Gaza 'Board of Peace', Trump says\n\nWho is on Trump's 'Board of Peace' overseeing Gaza's reconstruction?\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Breakfast programme from Davos, Cooper said the UK had received an invitation to join the board and strongly supported Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza.\n\n\"That's why we are also clear we want to play our part in phase two of the Gaza peace process,\" Cooper said.\n\nBut she added: \"We won't be one of the signatories today because this is a legal treaty that raises much broader issues.\n\n\"And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that's talking about peace when we've still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"\n\nShe said Putin had shown no willingness \"to come and make that agreement and that's where the pressure needs to be now\".\n\n\"But we will have continuing international discussions including with our allies,\" the foreign secretary said.\n\nDiplomatic relations between the US and the UK are on shakier ground after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European nations if his demand to hand control of Greenland to his country was not met.\n\nBut Trump appears to have backed down, saying the US was exploring a potential deal on Greenland after talks with the Nato security alliance, as he dropped planned tariffs on eight European countries and ruled out using force to take the island.\n\nCooper welcomed the apparent climbdown on Greenland and said the UK and its European allies had put forward \"positive, constructive proposals\" on security in the Arctic.\n\nBut when asked about the Board of Peace, Cooper echoed other UK cabinet ministers who in recent days have been expressing concerns over Putin's potential role in the scheme, given Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe UK has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies and together with France, signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops to the country if a peace deal is made with Russia.\n\nAs talks to end the war in Ukraine continue, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are due to meet in Davos on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump repeated his often-stated belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.\n\nTrump's Board of Peace was originally unveiled by the White House as part of a plan to rebuild Gaza and design its future governance.\n\nBut the leaked text of the board's founding charter goes far beyond that purpose.\n\nThe text says the board would be \"an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict\".\n\nThe leaked document says the Board of Peace's charter will enter into force once three states formally agree to be bound by it, with member states given renewable three-year terms and permanent seats available to those contributing $1bn (£740m), it said.\n\nThe charter declared the body as an international organisation mandated to carry out peace-building functions under international law, with Trump serving as chairman - and separately as the US representative - and holding authority to appoint executive board members and create or dissolve subsidiary bodies.\n\nLast Friday, the White House named seven members of the founding Executive Board, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nMore have now said they will join it, including Pakistan, Egypt and Qatar.\n\nThe Vatican has said the Pope has also received an invitation.",

    "fullText": "As the Ukraine-Russia drone arms race rages, hobbyists far from the war are pushing the limit for how quickly these small quadcopters can fly.\n\nA father-son duo in South Africa set a new Guinness World Record by reaching a ground speed of 408 mph with their custom, battery-powered remote-controlled quadcopter, the Peregreen V4.\n\nLuke and Mike Bell performed the record-breaking flight on December 11, 2025, the Guinness World Records organization said in a statement in January.\n\nWhile drones built for war are constrained by additional factors, the Bells' achievement expands the possibilities of how these devices might one day perform on the battlefield.\n\nIt also lays bare how accessible new war-relevant technology is becoming for civilians. The Bells documented their design and build process on YouTube, filming themselves using a 3D printer and off-the-shelf parts to create the Peregreen V4.\n\nTheir drone's design features a dome-shaped head and four propellers extending from the lower body — much like many of the interceptor drones available on the Ukrainian market today.\n\nThese drones, developed primarily as a low-cost way of countering Russian Shahed-type loitering munitions, have become a pillar of Ukrainian air defense.\n\nSome of the fastest interceptors available to Ukrainian forces can reach 200 mph, which is also the typical velocity of a bullet train.\n\nUkrainians are trying to push their quadcopters to fly even faster. Flight speed is key for these interceptors because they're designed to chase and crash into Shaheds, and Russia has been continually ramping up the speeds of its attack drones.\n\nThe Geran-2, a Shahed-type drone that Russia launches more commonly, can carry an explosive warhead for hundreds of miles at top speeds of 115 mph. Newer, jet-powered versions of Shaheds are estimated to fly up to 230 mph in some conditions.\n\nA major issue with faster drones is that their components tend to overheat when pushed to the limit — whether it's the propeller motors, wiring, or batteries.\n\nIn their YouTube videos, the Bells repeatedly recorded their drone or its individual parts catching fire during tests.\n\nDrone makers also have to juggle other design factors, such as the drone's aerodynamics and propeller efficiency.\n\nUkrainian war manufacturers face additional constraints: Their drones need to carry an additional payload — often 200 grams to 1 kg of explosives. They must also be maneuverable enough to pivot and catch a flying enemy target, and be mass-produced.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was already producing 1,000 interceptor drones a day.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bells' flight record involved a single drone that flew largely in a straight line.\n\nThe duo's latest certification is the third time they've attained the fastest-drone record. The previous holder of the achievement was Australian drone maker Ben Biggs, who built a drone that reached 389 mph late last year.\n\nBefore Biggs' record, the Bells' earlier quadcopter, the Peregreen V3, had flown at up to roughly 363 mph in the summer of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, the pair set a record of 298 mph with a similar drone design.\n\nGuinness World Records requires aspiring drone record-breakers to fly their device in two opposing directions and then calculate the average speed to account for wind.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine is set to receive 40,000 interceptor drones in January, thanks in part to a reward system that pays firms for every kill scored against a Russian Shahed, the country's defense minister said.\n\nMykhailo Fedorov said on Tuesday that Kyiv had rolled out a program inviting defense companies to test their small interceptor drones in Ukraine, paying them $20,000 for each Shahed drone their product destroyed.\n\n\"At the time, no one believed in it,\" Fedorov said at a press briefing. \"But now, by this month, 40,000 interceptors are expected to be delivered to the military.\"\n\nOften short of munitions and weapons, Ukraine invites defense firms from around the world — though mostly NATO countries — to test their products on the battlefield.\n\nFedorov, who was appointed defense minister last week, said the payment program had focused on the Chernihiv area, which sits between Kyiv and Russia's western border. Long-range attack drones launched from that border must fly over Chernihiv to reach the Ukrainian capital, and the region thus sees some of the heaviest Shahed flight traffic.\n\nInterceptor drones in Ukraine are generally small, first-person-view drones designed to fly at high speed to catch Russia's Gerans, delta-wing explosive-carrying drones closely based on the Iranian Shahed.\n\nThe most common type of Geran that Ukraine faces can cruise at roughly 6,500 feet and fly at up to 115 mph.\n\nBecause Russia can launch hundreds of these at a time, resource-strapped Ukrainians have prioritized keeping the cost of interceptor drones as low as possible. A typical one costs roughly several thousand US dollars.\n\nFedorov said on Tuesday that Ukraine's military had been actively looking into interceptors since at least February 2025. The technology has evolved rapidly over the last year, with Ukrainian firms still experimenting with designs at the start of 2025 and now scaling up manufacturing for mass production.\n\nReceiving 40,000 interceptors a month would mean that Ukraine can deploy more than 1,000 of them a day — an initial production goal set by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn a separate press briefing on Monday, Zelenskyy repeated that his country was now able to produce about 1,000 interceptors per day.\n\n\"But that is not enough,\" he said. \"Because, frankly speaking, our interceptor drones have already outpaced the number of our operators.\"\n\nZelenskyy said that Fedorov and Ukraine's chief commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, have been assigned with recruiting, training, and deploying more troops who can fly interceptor drones.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces fired nearly $100 million worth of air defense missiles battling Russia's latest bombardment, Kyiv revealed on Tuesday, offering insight into the war's growing financial toll.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that the Russian attack, which began Monday night and continued into Tuesday, forced Kyiv to launch around €80 million (roughly $94 million) worth of interceptor missiles.\n\n\"Imagine that — the cost of these missiles,\" Zelenskyy said over WhatsApp in response to a question about interceptor stockpiles.\n\nThe staggering figure covers only the interceptor missiles and does not appear to account for any other munitions expended to defend against the Russian attack, which also included hundreds of drones.\n\nRussia launched 18 ballistic missiles, 15 cruise missiles, and one anti-ship missile overnight, according to data from Ukraine's air force. It said in a statement that 27 were shot down, while five hit their targets.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia has \"significantly increased\" its use of ballistic missiles and has been able to obtain critical technology for the munitions from third-party countries and from industry.\n\n\"Nevertheless, their ability to produce these missiles must be reduced — and that is not happening yet,\" he said in response to another question.\n\nAlthough Ukraine has received some additional air defense systems from Western countries, Zelenskyy said more are still needed, along with additional interceptor missiles to keep pace with Russia's attacks.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged that it has been difficult for Ukraine to obtain the necessary interceptor missiles. He specifically singled out the PAC-3, which has a $3.7 million price tag and is fired from US-made Patriot batteries, as the best chance Kyiv has to defeat Russian ballistic missiles.\n\n\"War is an extremely expensive Russian luxury, and for us it results in severe losses,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussian missiles are not the only worry for Ukraine. Moscow's overnight attack involved 339 drones. Kyiv said its Air Force shot down 315 of them. Two dozen hit their targets.\n\nTo preserve its costly air defense missiles, Ukraine has been increasingly relying on locally made interceptor drones that cost as little as a few thousand dollars to hunt down and destroy Russian drones.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine is producing around 1,000 interceptor drones each day, a goal he set last summer. The challenge now, he said, is that the number of drones has outpaced the number of operators who can control them.\n\n\"Therefore, now we must catch up in terms of the number of interceptor groups — the corresponding mobile groups,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he has tasked senior Ukrainian military leadership with bridging the gap.",

    "description": "Ukraine is using ground robots and flying drones to take on Russia. One robot maker was surprised when soldiers combined them to be more effective.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian ground robot maker said soldiers surprised it with the ways they used its robots, including using flying drones to drop them closer to Russian positions.\n\nUkraine has a growing army of ground robots that can evacuate the injured, blow up inside or fire on Russian positions, lay or remove mines, carry cargo, and gather intelligence. It's a battlefield technology sector where Ukraine is rapidly experimenting and Western militaries are paying close attention.\n\nArk Robotics is one of the companies supplying these systems, making a suite of autonomous robots used by more than 20 Ukrainian brigades.\n\nIts CEO, Achi, told Business Insider that Ukrainian soldiers have demonstrated \"some really crazy ideas I would never imagine in my life that you would do.\" He spoke using a pseudonym as a security precaution.\n\nOne example involved pairing a small Ark ground robot with a larger aerial drone, which carried the robot forward before \"dropping it out of the sky.\"\n\nHe said that when he first saw it, his immediate reaction was: \"What the fuck? Why?\" Then it quickly made sense.\n\n\"The goal is simple: get a tool on the ground fast without putting a person in harm's way.\"\n\nUltimately, he found, \"it works.\"\n\nHe said this use \"wasn't the robot's original design, but give smart, motivated people a tool, and they'll find new ways to use it — and squeeze more out of it.\"\n\nThe \"soldiers keep surprising us,\" Achi said. \"They are very creative.\"\n\nAerial drones are available in significant numbers and are able to cover great distances quickly. Using them to transport ground robots helps overcome some of the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the robots, which have notable advantages once deployed.\n\nSmall ground robots can do things that are sometimes more challenging for aerial drones. They can drive into Russian dugouts or other positions to gather intelligence or deliver explosives. They can also be more precise when firing mounted weapons, and they are easier to conceal near Russian positions than aerial drones, which are noisy and have to hover overhead.\n\nAchi described the tactic as one example of how quickly battlefield technology and tactics are evolving in Ukraine.\n\n\"There is so much innovation happening right now that it's hard to comprehend,\" he said.\n\nOther arms makers have also been surprised at how Ukraine's forces have used their weaponry. Kuldar Väärsi, the founder and CEO of Estonia's Milrem Robotics, which makes ground robots used by Ukraine's forces, previously told BI that Ukrainian soldiers have used them in ways he hadn't expected.\n\n\"The creativity of Ukrainian troops is really admirable,\" he said, adding that the way the company's robots are used in Ukraine has led it to make changes in their design.\n\nCompanies with products deployed in Ukraine are seeking constant feedback from soldiers, often through group chats, video calls, and direct visits to front-line units.\n\nAchi said the challenge for Ark Robotics is keeping pace with new ideas without changing products so rapidly that large-scale production becomes impossible.\n\nArk needs to experiment constantly and stay aware of what's happening on the battlefield, but focusing on the wrong trends would mean sacrificing both mass and quality.\n\n\"This iteration cycle is insane. I've never seen anything like it,\" he said. It can mean making five different changes to a product in a few weeks, all while trying to make sure that you \"lead your whole engineering team the right way.\"\n\nAchi said that even the importance of ground robots surprised him. In 2023, they were a \"random side project,\" he said, but Ark has leaned into the technology.\n\nArk Robotics also develops aerial drones and is making a system called Frontier that it says will enable thousands of aerial drones and ground robots to work together effectively with minimal human involvement.\n\nUkraine's defense industry has boomed since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022, and its Western partners have been closely watching, impressed at how quickly it can develop and make weaponry.\n\nGround robots still make up only a small fraction of Ukraine's drone usage, but it's a growing area, with more companies entering the space and existing ones growing.\n\nAchi said he believes Ukraine is moving toward a future in which robots handle a significant share of front-line logistics. His long-term view is that sending people into vehicles near the front lines will increasingly make little sense.",

    "title": "Ukraine's elite Alpha unit dealt a $4 billion blow to Russian air defenses last year, security forces say",
    "description": "The Security Service of Ukraine said its \"Alpha\" special forces hit Russian air defense and radar systems with long-range strikes.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's elite \"Alpha\" unit destroyed or disabled Russian air defense systems that were worth a total of around $4 billion over the past year, the country's security service said.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Monday that its \"Alpha\" special forces unit conducted long-range strikes on Russian air defense and radar systems. The unit heavily relies on long-range drones in its attacks.\n\nIt said the strikes managed to break open corridors in Russia's multilayered air defenses and created safe passages to allow Ukraine's long-range drones to punch deep behind enemy lines.\n\nThose deep-strike assets struck targets like military bases, warehouses, and airfields, the SBU said. Ukraine has reported a slew of such strikes, which are key in preventing a big Russian force buildup and hindering operations.\n\nThe SBU listed off the types of air defense systems it said Alpha attacks destroyed or damaged: S-300s and S-400s, BUK M-1s and M-2s, Pantsir S-1s and S-2s, and Tor-M1s, M2s, and M3s. These systems range from older, Soviet-era models to some of Russia's most advanced systems.\n\nMany of these systems come with large price tags, though the cost of the losses is often the estimated current cost of replacement. Russia's defense industrial base faces strains from sanctions and other pressures.\n\nThe Ukrainian security service said the Russians also suffered losses of radar reconnaissance and guidance equipment, including radar stations and radars. Examples listed by the SBU included the Nebo-U radar and the Gamma-D.\n\nThe Alpha group is an elite unit that is considered among the best of Ukraine's special forces. It frequently carries out long-range drone attacks on Russian targets, including on aircraft, ammunition depots, and oil operations in Russia.\n\nIn November, the SBU said that its \"Alpha\" special forces had killed more than 1,500 Russian soldiers and destroyed dozens of tanks, armored combat vehicles, multiple rocket launchers, and air defense systems over the previous month.\n\nAir defense systems have been an integral part of this conflict, fundamentally shaping how it has been fought. Russia and Ukraine, at the start of the full-scale war in February 2022, possessed the largest and second-largest air defense arsenals in Europe, respectively, and their proliferation has heavily restricted front-line air operations. Neither side has been able to secure permanent control of the skies.\n\nA lack of air cover hamstrung large-scale breakthrough efforts, blunting the effectiveness of weaponry like tanks and contributing to the war's transformation into a slow, grinding fight, one where drones dominate and further prevent maneuver.\n\nUkraine has reported the destruction of a slew of Russian air defense weapons throughout the war, including advanced S-400s and a host of defenses on the strategic Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed illegally in 2014. Crippling these has been a priority.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has raised alarms in much of Europe and NATO about the lack of ground-based air defenses. Investment in them slowed after the Cold War. The alliance has pledged a huge investment in them, but it's the kind of ramp-up that takes time. Western manufacturers already have big backlogs amid the increased demand.\n\nAir defense is vital for combating not just crewed and uncrewed aircraft, but also missiles, and there is a substantial global demand for proven capabilities. US defense giant Lockheed Martin recently announced a deal with the Pentagon to dramatically boost production of Patriot interceptors.\n\nUkraine has received air defense systems from partner nations over the course of the war, from advanced US-made Patriots to improvised \"FrankenSAMs\" that mix Soviet launchers with Western missiles. Ukraine is building its own air defense systems to reduce dependency on partners.\n\nUkraine says it needs more air defenses and far more interceptors. Russia regularly hammers the country with massive missile and drone barrages targeting both military and civilian infrastructure.\n\nThough Ukraine appears to be inflicting damage, Russia's air defense arsenal is still a threat.\n\nJustin Bronk, an airpower expert at the Royal United Services Institute, warned in a report this month that despite Russia's ground-based integrated air defence systems suffering attrition from Ukraine, Russia still has several hundred batteries of different surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems in service.\n\nFurthermore, he said, they have also become \"significantly more effective\" at shooting down Ukrainian air assets as Russia learns throughout the war.\n\nAnd beyond Ukraine, he warned that Russia's ground-based air defenses remain \"a highly potent threat to NATO air capabilities in a European context.\"",

    "description": "Oleksandr Syrskyi said that Russia is currently producing 404 Shaheds \"of various types\" per day.",
    "fullText": "Russia has plans to more than double production of its Iranian-designed attack drones to 1,000 per day, said Ukrainian Armed Forces' commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi.\n\n\"The enemy plans to significantly increase production to use up to 1,000 drones per day,\" Syrskyi said of these drones.\n\nHe was speaking in an interview published on Sunday by the local media outlet LB.Ua, in which he commented on a wide range of topics, including the effectiveness of Ukraine's deep strikes into Russia and the balance of power in drone warfare.\n\nSyrskyi gave a precise assessment of Russia's current Shahed manufacturing, saying that Moscow can now produce 404 Shahed drones \"of various types\" every day.\n\nThese Russian delta-wing drones are closely modeled after Iran's loitering munitions. Moscow manufactures its own versions, dubbed Gerans, as well as cheaper decoys called Gerberas.\n\nRussia typically deploys a mix of strike drones and decoys when launching long-range attacks into Ukraine, and can send hundreds in a single night.\n\nSyrskyi did not say if Russia's daily Shahed production included Gerberas, nor did he break down exact production figures for each type of Shahed-type drone. The Geran-1 and Geran-2, propeller-driven drones that can fly up to 115 mph, are more common than the faster, jet-powered Geran-3.\n\nLaunching 1,000 Shahed-type drones a day would be a massive surge in Russia's attack capability. Moscow has generally been deploying 5,000 to 6,000 Shaheds a month against Ukraine, and half to four-fifths of these are usually strike variants.\n\nPer an analysis by the Institute for Science and International Security, Russia launched an average of 166 Shahed drones per day in December 2025. However, it's known to sometimes pause or reduce the intensity of its strikes to accumulate a stockpile for later use in a single large wave.\n\nCost is a major advantage for Shaheds. Each is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $70,000, making it cheaper and easier to manufacture than a conventional missile and providing Russia with a way to scale up its strike capability more sustainably.\n\nResource-strapped Ukraine has responded by seeking cheaper complements for its air defense network, including the growing use of small interceptor drones.\n\nStill, Russia's monthly use of Shahed-type drones has remained largely stagnant for the last six months. Moscow has, meanwhile, been experimenting with the loitering munitions, such as equipping them with air-to-air missiles or rear-facing cameras.\n\nSyrskyi's public assessment also comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned on Friday that his country was running low on ammunition for Western-supplied air defense systems.\n\nZelenskyy said that Ukraine had just secured a replenished stock of those munitions, but before that, it was fielding \"several systems without missiles.\"\n\n\"Today I can say this openly, because today, I have those missiles,\" he said.\n\nAs for other drones used in the war, Syrskyi said that Russia and Ukraine were now evenly matched in production quantity. Both Kyiv and Moscow have sporadically claimed the advantage on this front in recent years.\n\n\"The question is in quality. In conventional drones, quality is on our side. In fiber optics, unfortunately, we are only catching up with the enemy,\" Syrskyi said.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drone strikes damaged energy networks in Russia-occupied parts of southern Ukraine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power on Sunday, according to Kremlin-installed authorities there.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has kept up its hammering of Ukraine’s energy grid in overnight attacks that killed at least two people, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nMore than 200,000 households in the Russia-held part of Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region had no electricity on Sunday, according to the Kremlin-installed local governor.\n\nIn a Telegram post, Yevgeny Balitsky said that nearly 400 settlements have had their supply cut, because of damage to power networks from Ukrainian drone strikes.\n\nRussia has hammered Ukraine’s power grid, especially in winter, throughout the nearly four-year war. The strikes aim to weaken Ukrainians’ will to resist in a strategy that Kyiv officials call “weaponizing winter.”\n\nRussia targeted energy infrastructure in Odesa region overnight on Sunday, according to Ukraine’s Emergency Service. A fire broke out and was promptly extinguished.\n\nAt least six people were wounded in the Dnipropetrovsk region from Russian attacks, the emergency service said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that repairing the country’s energy system remains challenging, “but we are doing everything we can to restore everything as quickly as possible.”\n\nHe said that two people were killed in overnight attacks across the country that struck Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and Odesa.\n\nIn total, more than 1,300 attack drones, 1,050 guided aerial bombs and 29 missiles of various types were used by Russia to strike Ukraine this week, Zelenskyy said.\n\n“If Russia deliberately delays the diplomatic process, the world’s response should be decisive: more help for Ukraine and more pressure on the aggressor,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe spoke the day after a Ukrainian delegation arrived in the United States for talks on a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the war.\n\nOn Friday, Zelenskyy said that the delegation would try to finalize with U.S. officials documents for a proposed peace settlement that relate to postwar security guarantees and economic recovery.\n\nIf American officials approve the proposals, the U.S. and Ukraine could sign the documents next week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Zelenskyy said at a Kyiv news conference with Czech President Petr Pavel. Trump plans to be in Davos, according to organizers.\n\nRussia would still need to be consulted on the proposals.\n\nSeparately, in Russia’s Caucasus mountains, two children and an adult were wounded overnight as debris from a Ukrainian drone fell on a five-story residential building in North Ossetia, according to the regional governor.\n\nSeventy people had to be evacuated from the building, in the town of Beslan, and there was damage to its roof and windows, Gov. Sergei Menyaylo said in a Telegram post on Sunday morning.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said that its forces shot down or suppressed 63 Ukrainian drones overnight over Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. One person was hospitalized in Russia’s Krasnodar region east of Crimea following a drone strike, local authorities said.\n\nUkrainian crews have started repair works on the backup power line connecting the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to the power grid, under a ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based U.N. organization said in an X post on Sunday.\n\nThe fate of the plant, occupied by Russia and the largest in Europe, is a central issue in ongoing U.S.-brokered peace talks.\n\n“Crucial repair works on the essential back up Ferosplavna-1 330 kV power line connecting Ukraine’s ZNPP to the grid have begun under another IAEA-brokered ceasefire,” the agency said in the post.\n\nThe 330-kilovolt power line, which was damaged and disconnected because of fighting, is crucial to supplying the plant with electricity.",

The case is being heard behind closed doors.\n\nThe EU has frozen 210 billion euros ($244 billion) worth of Russian assets as part of the sanctions imposed on Moscow after it sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Euroclear holds around 193 billion euros of the seized funds.\n\nMoscow's Arbitration Court picked up the case even though the EU last month set aside its initial plan to use frozen Russian assets to assist Ukraine after failing to convince Belgium that it would be protected from Russia's retaliation. The bloc opted instead for borrowing 90 billion euros on capital markers to provide an interest-free loan to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years.\n\nRussia's Central Bank has condemned the use of frozen assets to aid Ukraine as “illegal, contrary to international law,” arguing that they violated “the principles of sovereign immunity of assets.”",

    "description": "Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves ​of Russian attacks on its infrastructure, mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters on Friday.\n\nKyiv, one of Eastern ‌Europe's largest cities, requires 1,700 megawatts of electricity to power the services for its 3.6 million people, Klitschko said.\n\nKlitschko said the current energy crisis ‌was the most difficult challenge facing the capital in the nearly four years since Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\n\"It's the first time in the history of our city that, in such severe frosts, most of the city was left without heating and with a huge shortage of electricity,\" Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, said in an interview ⁠in his office at the heart of ‌Kyiv.\n\nSome Kyiv residents face up to 18 to 20 hours a day without mains electricity. Ukraine declared an energy emergency this week as its grid crumbles due to accumulated wartime ‍damage and a new targeted wave of Russian bombardments.\n\nBitter cold weather with icy rain and snow exacerbated the challenges. Nighttime minimum temperatures have dipped to around -17 Celsius (1 Fahrenheit) in Kyiv this week.\n\nFAST REPAIRS, GENERATORS AND INTERNATIONAL AID\n\nKlitschko said Ukraine's international partners had ​rushed in additional generators, and repair teams had worked round the clock to restore heating following a Russian ‌strike last week that knocked out supplies to 6,000 apartment buildings.\n\nAbout 100 buildings still have no heating, he said.\n\n\"We're not just working during the day now, we're working at night too,\" he said. \"There is no such thing as the start and end of the working day for us.\"\n\nIn addition to repairs and generators, the city opened about 1,300 sites with heaters to help residents keep warm, and was working to install mini thermal power stations in ⁠some districts to decentralize electricity and heating.\n\nWith generators, the priority was ​to provide electricity to ensure water supplies and power hospitals, kindergartens, ​and other key critical infrastructure, Klitschko said. About 300 tonnes of fuel a day were needed to do that.\n\nKlitschko reiterated his call for Kyiv residents to leave the city if they ‍have the opportunity to do ⁠so to ease the pressure on its infrastructure.\n\nSchools in Kyiv extended their winter holidays, and many commercial companies have switched to remote work arrangements.\n\nKlitschko said that despite all the challenges, city officials were determined to ⁠restore heating supplies in full, and they were also planning for backup scenarios in case new Russian air strikes damage the energy infrastructure.\n\n\"This ‌winter will be difficult, but we are doing everything that's possible and impossible,\" Klitschko said.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Olena Harmash; editing by Daniel Flynn and Alex Richardson)",

    "fullText": "The battlefield in Ukraine is changing constantly, and weapons makers are rushing to keep up.\n\nDrone and ground robot makers said they're designing their systems in ways that allow them to be easily updated.\n\nThey're either modular, meaning parts can be swapped out, or designed so software changes are all that's needed.\n\nRapid changes on the battlefield in Ukraine are prompting Western weapons manufacturers to reassess how military technology is developed and upgraded.\n\nWith the fight evolving quickly, arms companies in Ukraine and Europe say that they can't afford to start from scratch and completely redesign entire systems each time conditions shift.\n\nInstead, companies making aerial drones and ground robots told Business Insider that their focus is now on creating weapons that can be upgraded by simply changing parts or software rather than overhauling the whole system.\n\nDesigns are modular, like Lego pieces, with parts being easily swapped out as new mission demands arise. Increasingly, companies are turning to software-first designs for more convenient upgrades.\n\nDefense technology has been moving in this direction, but revelations from Russia's war against Ukraine are injecting new urgency.\n\nPatrick Shepherd, the chief sales officer for Milrem Robotics, an Estonian company that makes autonomous uncrewed ground vehicles and has some in Ukraine, said that these changes are key to staying ahead, as they provide much faster adaptation than what \"traditional, monolithic designs\" permit.\n\nUkraine's soldiers say that battlefield tech can become out of date in weeks and months, with electronic warfare, new drone countermeasures, and new tactics blunting once-effective systems.\n\nAmong the companies involved in this evolving technology battle is DroneShield, an Australian company that develops counter-drone technology and operates across Europe. It has multimillion-dollar US military contracts and has multiple systems in Ukraine.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of DroneShield's US arm, said that the drone and counter-drone fight has sped up globally since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, cutting development cycles to weeks rather than months or years.\n\nThe only way to keep pace, he said, is to build \"systems that are not fixed, solving the problem of today, but ones that can address an issue today and adapt as needed.\"\n\nLithuanian drone company Granta Autonomy was one of the first companies to send drones to Ukraine. CEO Gediminas Guoba said the company needs to build systems that are not simply ready for this year or the next, but can be updated and upgraded for new operations even further into the future.\n\nThat means building systems that can be easily reworked. Anything else, he said, and \"we will lose the battle.\"\n\nMcCrann said the faster development cycle is why DroneShield has put greater emphasis on modular and adaptable designs.\n\nLikewise, Shepherd said that Milrem builds flexibility into its systems from the outset, allowing sensors, payloads, mission systems, and other components to be integrated, removed, or upgraded without redesigning the entire vehicle.\n\nAchi, the CEO of Ukraine's Ark Robotics, which makes autonomous robots used by nearly two dozen Ukrainian brigades, said the company focuses on making its platforms \"as cheap and as mass producible as possible.\" He spoke to Business Insider using a pseudonym as a security precaution.\n\n\"And then when we get this right, we can do surface-level customization,\" like adding armor or additional equipment. The base platform remains the same, letting the company scale production without driving up costs.\n\nLatvia-based Origin Robotics manufactures both drones and drone interceptors used by Ukrainian and NATO forces. Its CEO, Agris Kipurs, told BI that the company also prioritizes modular systems to adapt quickly to battlefield changes.\n\nModular designs aren't just for companies striving to keep their edge in a competitive industry. Warfighters need them too. Ukrainian soldiers have said they need flexible systems that can be easily modified at the front.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, the head of robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that the ground robots his unit uses can be configured for different missions, be it evacuating wounded troops or attacking Russian positions. He said the robots work like Lego bricks.\n\nShepherd said that Milrem's robots follow the same logic, avoiding designs built around a single mission. They can be customized by soldiers for evacuation, explosive disposal, intelligence gathering, or weaponized roles.\n\nIn some cases, soldiers adapt systems in ways manufacturers did not anticipate.\n\nWestern companies say they are learning from those changes. McCrann said Ukraine has been technologically innovative \"because they have to be,\" and that this is driving industry adaptation.\n\nCompanies sometimes have group chats and FaceTime calls with Ukrainian soldiers to get real-time feedback, and weapons software is where they can make the biggest changes the fastest.\n\nShepherd said that software is now playing a central role in adapting systems, whether for command-and-control integration or mission management. \"Software updates can be developed, tested, and deployed much more quickly, allowing lessons learned from the field to be integrated on shorter timescales,\" he said.\n\nMcCrann said DroneShield has focused on a software-first approach, where upgrades add new capabilities without hardware modifications.\n\nGuoba said Granta Autonomy's drones have not changed much over the last year or two, but the software inside them, on the other hand, \"is changing every month.\"\n\nSoftware can be remotely pushed to weaponry already in Ukraine, eliminating the need to ship gear back to the factory. That speed, and the ability to test changes quickly, has made software the preferred tool for rapid adaptation.\n\nUltimately, Ark Robotics' Achi said, \"software is easier to do.\"\n\nArk's aerial drones and ground robots rely on onboard and server-based software, and the company is developing systems to allow thousands of platforms to operate together with minimal human involvement.\n\nHe said Ark also deploys engineers forward to implement software changes tailored to specific units or missions. It follows a similar approach for hardware, though those changes take longer to implement.\n\nKipurs said Origin makes its systems \"software-intensive\" so development is continuous, \"with updates regularly pushed to improve systems that have already been delivered.\"\n\nIt only uses hardware changes \"when they provide clear benefits across all intended users.\" Because the company also builds for NATO customers, systems must remain broadly interoperable.\n\nShepherd said companies still need to strike a balance. Systems must remain reliable, so not every update can be rushed to the field. The key, he said, is close collaboration with Ukrainian soldiers and fast but disciplined feedback loops.",

    "description": "Macron said that Ukraine was previously \"overwhelmingly dependent\" on US intelligence, but that France is now providing \"two-thirds\" of that service.",
    "fullText": "French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that his country has now overtaken the US as the main provider of intelligence to Ukraine.\n\n\"Where Ukraine was overwhelmingly dependent on American intelligence capacity, a year ago, two-thirds is today provided by France. Two-thirds,\" Macron said in a New Year's speech to the French military.\n\nThe French leader's comments indicate a shift in the dynamics of Western contributions to the war and suggest that the US may have scaled back its military relationship with Ukraine.\n\nThe US briefly suspended intelligence-sharing and aid to Ukraine in March 2025, as the Trump administration was attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Kyiv and Moscow. After roughly a week, Washington said it was lifting the suspension.\n\nBut it's been unclear so far whether the Pentagon has continued to provide intelligence at the same level as it did during the Biden administration.\n\nThe New York Times previously reported that, in those years, US-Ukrainian intelligence-sharing ties had been so close that officials from both countries worked in the same facility to coordinate military strikes.\n\nOne of the most vital roles played by US intelligence at the time was providing targeting data and situational awareness for Ukrainian troops, especially when the latter were using American-made systems for the attacks.\n\nUkraine has since been trying to develop its own strike capabilities, including long-range precision missiles, that might allow it to strike Russia without Western approval.\n\nIt's also unclear exactly how Macron quantified two-thirds of Ukrainian intelligence capabilities. His speech did not say whether he was referring to two-thirds of the intelligence provided by Ukraine's foreign partners or to two-thirds of all the intelligence used by Ukraine's forces.\n\nThe Élysée Palace and French defense ministry did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours. Ukraine's defense ministry and the Pentagon have also not responded to similar requests for comment on Macron's remarks.\n\nThe French president's point on intelligence-sharing with Ukraine aligns with his larger push to position Paris as a regional military leader, while the Trump administration seeks to curb American involvement in Europe. President Donald Trump has also recently rattled European leaders by alluding that the US could try to take over Greenland, a Danish territory.\n\nMacron said on Thursday that France had helped Ukraine to rebuild its forces and provided Kyiv with security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire.\n\nLast week, European NATO members and the US issued a declaration that said willing countries would form a multinational, \"European-led\" force to provide \"reassurances\" to Ukraine and stave off a second Russian invasion or attack.\n\n\"The signal sent to our Ukrainian partners, to other Europeans, and to the world is that we are ready,\" Macron said. \"We are ready to sustain this effort of resistance. We are ready to deter new aggressions or to maintain peace on our soil.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is pointing the finger at an unlikely target after his much-touted efforts to broker an end to the war in Ukraine failed to gain traction.\n\nAsked why U.S.-led peace talks have stalled, Trump blamed the victim of the invasion, claiming it was the Ukrainian leader’s fault. Asked directly what was standing in the way, he gave a one-word answer to Reuters: “Zelensky.”\n\nAt the same time, Trump argued that Moscow is prepared to conclude the conflict, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin is eager to bring the nearly four-year invasion to a close. “I think he’s ready to make a deal,” Trump said, adding, “I think Ukraine is less ready to make a deal.”\n\nOn Thursday, the Kremlin said they agree with Trump’s remarks, which are in contrast to those of European allies, who have long maintained that Moscow is not genuinely interested in ending the conflict, instead aiming to seize additional territory while avoiding new Western sanctions.\n\nTrump, who previously said he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine “in a day” if he won a second term, has frequently clashed with Zelensky over the past year.\n\nNegotiations took a sharp turn in March last year when a public clash between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office derailed a widely promoted agreement that would have given the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, with the Ukrainian president leaving the White House without signing the deal. In the aftermath, Trump briefly halted military assistance and intelligence sharing, though both were restored the following month.\n\nSince then, the interactions between the two presidents have improved, with Ukrainian officials being deeply involved in recent peace talks, led by the U.S.\n\nRecent U.S.-led diplomacy has focused on what security guarantees Ukraine would receive after a ceasefire to prevent another Russian attack. As part of those discussions, American negotiators have broadly urged Kyiv to consider relinquishing control of the eastern Donbas region in exchange for an agreement with Russia.\n\nZelensky, however, has repeatedly rejected any suggestion of territorial concessions, insisting Ukraine’s constitution bars the government from surrendering any of its land to Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces have continued to press their offensive in Ukraine despite Trump’s claims that his pressure campaign and peace efforts are gaining traction with the Kremlin.\n\nIn mid-January, Moscow confirmed the launch of a hypersonic Oreshnik missile into western Ukraine near the EU border, a high-speed strike that hit infrastructure in the Lviv region. Western officials condemned it as an escalation even as peace proposals were being discussed.\n\nAt the same time, Russia has repeatedly carried out large waves of missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure while diplomatic talks have continued. In December, Ukrainian authorities reported hundreds of drones and missiles targeting power stations and other sites across the country, causing multiple injuries and widespread damage even as discussions on ending the war persisted.\n\nMoscow’s foreign ministry has also signaled reluctance to accept partial ceasefires as credible.\n\nIn his New Year’s message, Zelensky warned that Moscow was deliberately continuing its war, saying that “Russia deliberately brings war” with night time shelling and large drone attacks, and thanked Ukrainian defenders for repelling many of them.\n\nWhen asked why he believes Zelensky has resisted moving forward with peace talks, Trump told Reuters: “I just think he’s, you know, having a hard time getting there.”",

    "description": "In his remarks at Ukraine's parliament, Mykhailo Fedorov warned of nearly 2 million Ukrainians dodging the military draft.",
    "fullText": "Around 2 million Ukrainians are dodging military drafts, while another 200,000 are absent without official leave, or AWOL, Kyiv's newly appointed defense minister said on Wednesday.\n\nThe tally revealed by Mykhailo Fedorov is a rare disclosure by the Ukrainian leadership about the troop shortages the country has grappled with throughout the war.\n\nFedorov, who was previously minister of digital transformation, was speaking in Ukraine's parliament as representatives confirmed his new appointment in the defense role.\n\nThe defense minister said roughly 2 million Ukrainians are \"wanted\" for evading callups, with another 200,000 soldiers voluntarily leaving their posts without permission to do so.\n\nFedorov has pledged wide reform, saying he would audit Ukraine's military and root out systemic issues \"that have accumulated over the years\" in training and command.\n\n\"We cannot fight with new technologies under an old organizational structure,\" Fedorov said.\n\nUnder martial law in Ukraine, going AWOL is defined as being away without permission for more than three days, an act that can carry a prison sentence of between five to 10 years. Desertion is when a soldier is deemed to be intentionally avoiding service and carries a more severe sentence of up to 12 years in prison.\n\nA soldier could go AWOL if they are given a break from the fighting or leave to return home, then fail to show up when ordered to do so. Sometimes, troops simply flee their positions.\n\nThe figures relayed by Fedorov may be affected by a notorious tactic among Ukrainian troops seeking to transfer to another unit, especially if they were previously denied. Some soldiers try to circumvent the official process by going AWOL and then reporting for duty again with a recommendation for their desired unit.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general's office told local media outlet Ukrainska Pravda last year that, from the start of the war to September 2025, it had opened over 235,000 criminal cases for AWOL-related offenses, as well as over 53,000 for desertion.\n\nAs a loose comparison, some records say that a rough total of 150,000 American and British troops deserted or went AWOL during World War II across the entire European theater.\n\nAnother key concern implied in Fedorov's speech is the sheer scale of missing recruits that Kyiv desperately needs.\n\nThe country is already straining against Russia's much larger war economy and military industrial complex, and one of its most pressing needs is to replenish its fighters on the front lines.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that his country fields around 880,000 active-duty personnel, though other estimates vary.\n\nThe lack of reinforcements is crushing both for Ukrainian morale and operational success. Without reinforcements, some Ukrainian units have reported holding frontline positions for years with barely any rest or opportunity to rotate out to see their families.\n\nIn the city of Pokrovsk, for example, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv's troops were outnumbered 1 to 8 in the fall, when Russia aggressively tried to take control of the devastated regional hub via repeated ground assaults.\n\nUkrainian men aged 25 to 60 are eligible to be called up for active duty, though those as young as 18 must register with the military. Thousands of Ukrainian men have fled overseas since the war started. Many have done so illegally; Ukraine doesn't allow men aged 23 to 60 to leave its borders.\n\nFedorov said a key focus of his audit would be to assess what Ukraine can do more efficiently with the troops it has now. One of these reform goals is to ensure basic-level staffing in all of Ukraine's drone brigades, which he said is now \"definitely lacking.\"\n\n\"Today, the top 50 out of 400 total units involved in drones provide 70% of enemy damage,\" he said. \"Imagine the potential of the defense forces if we help the remaining 350 grow.\"\n\nThe defense minister, who is 35, also said the Ukrainian military is starting the year with considerably fewer resources. Its budget for 2026 is roughly 300 billion Ukrainian hryvnias, or $7 billion, lower than that for 2025, Fedorov said.",

The former head of Ukraine’s digital transformation policies is credited with spearheading the the army's drone technology and introducing several successful e-government platforms.\n\nHis appointment was part of a broad government reshuffle that the Ukrainian leader said aimed to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy amid a new U.S.-led push to find a peace settlement.\n\nFedorov said the defense ministry is facing a shortfall of 300 billion hryvnia ($6.9 billion) in funding needs.\n\nThe European Union will dedicate most of a massive new loan program to help fund Ukraine’s military and economy over the next two years, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday.\n\nFedorov said Ukraine’s defense sector has expanded significantly since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. At the start of the war, he said, the country had seven private drone companies and two firms developing electronic warfare systems. Today, he said, there are nearly 500 drone manufacturers and about 200 electronic warfare companies in Ukraine.\n\nHe added that some sectors have emerged from scratch, including private missile producers, which now number about 20, and more than 100 companies manufacturing ground-based robotic systems.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Up to 25,000 Russian soldiers are being killed every month, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said this week.",
    "fullText": "Russia's military is suffering heavy losses fighting in Ukraine, with up to 25,000 soldiers killed a month, NATO's top civilian official said this week, calling the carnage \"unsustainable\" for Moscow.\n\n\"The Russians, at the moment, are losing massive amounts of their soldiers thanks to the Ukrainian defense,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told European lawmakers at a forum in Brussels on Tuesday. He said that 20,000 to 25,000 troops are dying each month as the war drags on.\n\n\"I'm not talking seriously wounded. Killed.\" Rutte clarified. He compared the incredibly high losses to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, where an estimated 15,000 of its soldiers were killed over a period of more than nine years.\n\n\"Now they lose this amount or \n\nRussia has not disclosed official casualty figures, but Ukrainian and Western estimates paint a grim picture for Moscow.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said in an intelligence update Wednesday that Russia has likely suffered over 1.2 million battlefield casualties since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, averaging 1,100 soldiers killed and wounded every day last month.\n\nRussia's average daily casualty rate from August to December 2025 increased steadily, although it was still lower than during the same months in 2024, according to the ministry. It said the recent uptick came as Moscow made small territorial gains, and the heavy losses are expected to roll into 2026 \"with continued dismounted infantry attacks on multiple axes.\"\n\nRussian forces have been focused on seizing the war-torn city of Pokrovsk in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region for more than a year. It has been the site of some of the war's most intense fighting.\n\nUkrainian officials have said that attack drones are the biggest battlefield killer of people and equipment, believed to be responsible for eliminating around 90% of all targets hit. Military units regularly publish footage of their combat kills on social media.\n\nThe casualty assessments underscore the significant attrition for Russia. It has a much larger population pool from which it can pull new soldiers and replenish losses than Ukraine does. However, Moscow has tried to avoid large-scale involuntary mobilization during the war, and conflict analysts believe it is unlikely to do so anytime soon.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, a Russia research fellow with the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, told Business Insider that Moscow has increasingly relied on covert and informal recruitment networks to avoid a full mobilization, which would likely come at a tremendous political cost.\n\nRussian military efforts to bring fresh troops into its war against Ukraine include offering financial benefits to some informal recruiters, sourcing combat personnel from overseas, and playing with the legislation on the use of active and inactive reserves, among some other unofficial methods, Stepanenko said.\n\n\"Before, the Kremlin just assigned your military recruitment centers, some paramilitary organizations, and regional authorities to do recruitment,\" she said. Now, Moscow has to think: \"Where else can we squeeze recruits from?\"\n\nUS and Ukrainian assessments from last year suggested that Russia was pulling an average of 30,000 to 36,000 new soldiers a month into the war, figures similar to its casualty rate. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said thousands more than that are volunteering.\n\n\"It is certainly a challenge for Russian forces to replace personnel and replace the casualties,\" Stepanenko said, adding that Russia will eventually \"hit a wall\" if it doesn't change its personnel and recruitment system eventually.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine, which does not disclose official casualty figures similar to Russia, is believed to have suffered an estimated 400,000 soldiers killed and wounded. Those losses hit hard, as Ukraine faces a constant struggle for manpower.\n\nThe proliferation of drones over the battlefield has made it increasingly difficult to evacuate casualties from a widening kill zone that extends in both directions along the front line, significantly contributing to the heavy losses.\n\nUkrainian and Western soldiers and officers have said that \"golden hour\" — the first 60 minutes after a severe injury when medical treatment determines whether a soldier lives or dies — is long gone in this war.",

    "description": "Ukraine's air command for the central region published video of the Tempest firing what appear to be Hellfire Longbow missiles into the night sky.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's air defense forces said they've destroyed at least 21 Russian Shaheds with a new American light vehicle that fires guided missiles from its back.\n\nThe vehicle, called the Tempest, featured in a video posted on Tuesday by Ukraine's Air Command for the country's central region.\n\nThe footage showed at least three video clips of the system firing into the night sky, its missile arcing upward to track its target.\n\n\"As of now, our crew has destroyed 21 Shahed drones,\" said a Ukrainian soldier, identified by Air Command Central as an operator with the call-sign \"Shorty,\" in the video.\n\nThe four-wheeled, off-road buggy is equipped with a dual launcher that appears to be fitted with missiles that look like the AGM-114 Hellfire.\n\nThese American-made missiles typically require the assistance of a laser to track their targets and are often fired from aircraft such as the MQ-9 Reaper and the AH-64 Apache.\n\nThe Tempest, however, likely uses the Longbow variant, which instead uses radar to home in on targets in a fire-and-forget fashion. The Hellfire Longbow carries a 9-kilogram, or 20-pound, warhead.\n\nThe Ukrainian video did not specifically identify the type of missile used. The company that built the Tempest, V2X, is a Virginia-headquartered firm that's also pitching the vehicle to the US Army.\n\n\"This machine keeps the sky locked down,\" Shorty said in the air command video.\n\nHe added that his crew was previously deployed to Ukraine's eastern regions, saying that they destroyed \"all targets\" they attacked there.\n\nOther clips of the Tempest in action showed the buggy maneuvering in open fields, muddy terrain, and on a road.\n\nMobility is a key need for Ukraine's fight against Russian Shahed drones. Because these loitering munitions fly at speeds exceeding 100 mph, air defense crews only have a short time after detecting a target to arrive at an ideal firing location and launch.\n\nUkrainian troops once relied on trucks mounted with machine guns, but had to scramble for other options as Russia significantly increased the number of drones launched and started adapting to fly Shaheds at higher altitudes.\n\nThe sheer quantity of Shaheds that Ukraine often faces means that it needs lower-cost munitions to take them down.\n\nA congressional report from 2021 said that from 1998 to that year, the US spent roughly $10.9 billion, adjusted for inflation, on buying about 87,500 Hellfire missiles. That's about $123,000 per missile, though that figure would also include costs such as training, launchers, software, and support equipment.\n\nPrices can also vary for different variants of the missile, and the Longbow's radar guidance likely results in it being on the more expensive side.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian officials estimate that Russia can produce older Shaheds at roughly $35,000 each, though Moscow was believed to likely be making them at $70,000 apiece in 2025.\n\nIt's unclear what the cost ratio is between a Tempest launch and a Shahed or Gerbera, which are decoy drones that Russia deploys to give Ukrainians more targets to attack.\n\nWhen debuting the Tempest to the US Army in October 2025, V2X said the vehicle is made with commercial off-the-shelf components and can be offered as a stationary, trailer-mounted launcher.\n\nIt's also unclear how many Tempests are deployed in Ukraine. Only one vehicle appears onscreen at a time, and Ukraine is known to openly invite foreign weapons companies to test their products on the battlefield.\n\nNotably, the same clips of the Tempest firing, cropped to conceal the vehicle, appeared in an earlier New Year's montage published by Air Command Central, indicating that the vehicle has been in Ukraine since December.\n\nUkraine has increasingly relied on small first-person-view drones that are tweaked to fly extremely quickly and serve as interceptors. While these can cost as little as $2,000 each, they typically also require a human pilot and crew to successfully track, chase, and destroy a Shahed drone.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States accused Russia on Monday of a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation” of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace.\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia’s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, a NATO ally.\n\nShe told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the United States deplores “the staggering number of casualties” in the conflict and condemns Russia’s intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.\n\nUkraine called for the meeting after last Thursday’s overnight Russian bombardment with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, including the powerful, new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, which Moscow used for only the second time in what was a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe large-scale attack came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nThe attack also coincided with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. And it came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Russia.\n\nMoscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. And Russia's U.N. ambassador on Monday blamed the diplomatic impasse on Ukraine.\n\nEurope’s leaders condemned the attack using the Oreshnik as “escalatory and unacceptable,” and U.S. envoy Bruce was equally tough on Monday.\n\n“At a moment of tremendous potential, due only to President Trump’s unparalleled commitment to peace around the world, both sides should be seeking ways to de-escalate,” she said. “Yet Russia’s action risks expanding and intensifying the war.”\n\nBruce reminded Russia that nearly a year ago it voted in favor of a Security Council resolution calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It would be nice if Russia matched their words with deeds,” she said. “In the spirit of that resolution, Russia, Ukraine and Europe must pursue peace seriously and bring this nightmare to an end.”\n\nBut Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council that until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “comes to his senses and agrees to realistic conditions for negotiations, we will continue solving the problem by military means.”\n\n“He was warned long ago, with each passing day, each day which he squanders, the conditions for negotiations will only get worse for him,” Nebenzia said. “Similarly, each vile attack on Russian civilians will elicit a stiff response.”\n\nUkraine’s U.N. Ambassador Andriy Melnyk countered that Russia is more vulnerable now than at any time since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Its economy is slowing and oil revenue is down.\n\n“Russia wants to sell to this council and the whole U.N. family the impression that it is invincible, but this is another illusion,” he told the council. “The carefully staged image of strength is nothing but smoke and mirrors, completely detached from reality.”",

    "description": "Injuries in Ukraine largely come from shrapnel and explosions. Medics say they're seeing damage to multiple parts of the body all at once.",
    "fullText": "The war in Ukraine is one of blast and shrapnel injuries, not gunshot wounds, a local medic and US veterans providing medical care in front-line areas told Business Insider.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine is characterized by fighting in extensive trench networks, where grenades continue to prove their worth, intense artillery fire, missile barrages, and drone attacks. Land mines also continue to be a problem.\n\nGunfights, however, are becoming less common.\n\nUS veterans and a Ukrainian medic told Business Insider that most combat injuries are caused by fragmentation and burns and that amputations are often necessary.\n\nThese injuries are not unusual for industrial, artillery-heavy conflicts, or more modern kinds of warfare, for that matter, but they are being exacerbated by new technology, such as exploding one-way attack drones and others that drop grenades and other deadly explosives.\n\n\"This is not a war of direct small-arms contact,\" the medic shared, \"but a war of remote destruction.\"\n\nKaterina Zirka, the Ukrainian combat medic, said that she increasingly sees injuries that affect multiple parts of the body at once, often without a single identifiable \"entry wound,\" but instead dozens of micro-injuries from blasts and shrapnel. The medical equipment she carries has changed as a result.\n\nMedics are also seeing internal blast injuries that don't come with external wounds, such as concussions, ruptured eardrums, and lung injuries from rapid changes in pressure, she said.\n\nSoldiers fighting in Ukraine have told Business Insider about being injured by exploding drones, mines, and falling debris when buildings are hit. Mortars, artillery, and rockets have also done their fair share of damage.\n\nA US veteran who fought in Ukraine and served as a combat medic for his unit previously told Business Insider that he saw a significant number of injuries from explosions, like burns, concussions, traumatic brain injuries, and wounds from shrapnel that resulted in amputations.\n\n\"Artillery is fucking everywhere out there. You go anywhere near the front, it's just artillery shell, artillery shell, artillery artillery,\" he said, speaking to BI on the condition of anonymity for operational security reasons.\n\nThe threats, however, are far more than artillery.\n\nJeffrey Wells, a US Navy veteran with experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, is involved in medical training for front-line Ukrainian civilians through a nonprofit organization, Task Force Antal, that also provides supplies and evacuation assistance. He shared details about the kinds of injuries he's seen in this role.\n\n\"Mostly people aren't being shot, even on the front lines,\" he explained. \"It's injuries that come from a missile, a drone, or a glide bomb.\"\n\nMark Antal, the co-founder of Task Force Antal and a veteran of the elite US special operations unit Delta Force, told Business Insider that he had to tell some of his group's medics that \"the soldiers on the front line, less than 2% of them are being shot. All of the wounds are from drones, from shrapnel.\"\n\nAnd with civilians, \"it's crush injuries, it's blast injuries.\"\n\nChristine Quinn Antal, a US Army veteran and former national security advisor who co-founded the nonprofit, said that with other injuries being significantly more prevalent, members have taken \"things like chest seals,\" tools used for gunshot wounds, out of their medical kits. \"We've moved away from that,\" she said.\n\nAway from the cities, out on the front lines, drones dominate warfare, but even in the close-quarters fighting, explosives, not necessarily guns, are key. There is still a role for guns in this war, but drones and other new tech are taking over classic combat roles, even the precision strike role of snipers.\n\nDrones are used in this war more than in any other conflict in history, and have fundamentally changed the shape of the war. Their ubiquity is shown by Ukraine's own stats. Its commander in chief said in November that drones were responsible for around 60% of all Russian targets hit.\n\nDrones direct traditional weapons but also engage targets as well. They are deadly tools readily available in large quantities at low costs, making them increasingly desirable tools as the war drags on.\n\nZirka said that injuries have changed because now, \"most engagements actually take place in the air through the use of drones. As a result, gunshot wounds are encountered much less frequently.\" Soldiers have told BI that drones have created a roughly 10-kilometer kill zone at the front.\n\nGuns are not gone from Ukraine, far from it, but it is a different kind of fighting. Soldiers carry and are trained on various guns for different missions, some of which sometimes actually lead to injuries that aren't gunshots.\n\nSoldiers often arm themselves against the ever-present threat of drones with electronic warfare tools and shotguns, among other systems. Shooting down drones, like the fiber-optic drones resistant to jamming, can generate dangerous shrapnel that can pierce or shred the skin.\n\nTroops also carry guns into trench warfare, which has been a prominent part of this fight.\n\nBut much of that fight also relies on other weapons, such as explosives like grenades and mines. These weapons are used to booby trap trenches and to try to clear them. The trenches can be so tight that it can make using firearms like assault rifles difficult.\n\nDrones are also used in trench battles, including by dropping grenades into enemy trenches or diving down on soldiers and exploding.\n\nLikewise, explosives are often used to clear bunkers as well. Charging into one for an extremely close-quarters firefight is exceptionally dangerous. A grenade, on the other hand, lowers the risk.\n\nUkraine has mounted machine guns and other weapons on its uncrewed ground robots, creating new ways to fire on the Russians using guns without putting its troops at risk, but these weapons are still quite limited for the time being. The same is true for the automated gun turrets.\n\nAs Zirka indicated, this war is more of a remote-explosive fight than a gunfight.",

    "description": "Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, a commander of a drone team, told Business Insider what it was like flying in the heavy fog that Russia used to its advantage.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, an ISR drone team leader in Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces. He deployed in 2025 near Pokrovsk, a key city that Russia said it captured in early December.\n\nBusiness Insider has verified his role in the Ukrainian armed forces. The article has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore the full-scale war, I was a software engineer, working for companies in San Francisco, New Zealand, and Germany.\n\nToday, I lead a team of five to six Ukrainian drone operators. Our task is to use high-flying drones to provide reconnaissance data to our troops and commanders.\n\nWith our intelligence, artillery such as HIMARS and drone strike teams can target Russian equipment and soldiers, often before they can even reach the front lines.\n\nWe were redeployed to the Pokrovsk area in August because the fighting there had become so intense. Because drone operators are priority targets in the war, we would spend our dayslong rotations in houses and underground bunkers outside the city.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the weather was sunny and ideal for flying.\n\nBut the end of October was a disaster for us. Ukraine turns foggy in the autumn, with thick and low clouds that can stack from 100 meters to 300 meters above the ground.\n\nThese are so thick that no infrared camera or thermal camera can see through them, and caused many days to be completely no-go for flying for our types of drones.\n\nAt the time, the Russians took advantage of the clouds, using them to cover their advance on foot and in vehicles. Given the weather, the number of personnel they sacrificed to take the city, and our limited resources, there was eventually no viable way for us to defend Pokrovsk forever.\n\nUkraine is dependent on drone warfare. It has carried us through the terrible and scary times of these Russian assaults, and it has changed the face of war. For the entire summer of 2025, for example, I saw a tank only twice on the battlefield.\n\nDrones are cheap and effective, and if we had an infinite number of drones, we would have been working 24/7 to fight the Russians in Pokrovsk.\n\nBut we don't have infinite drones, so in the meantime, we need other strike tools and resources, such as more artillery fire and troops. War is complex, and drones cannot be its only solution.\n\nIn normal conditions, we fly our drones four times a day, with each flight lasting about three to four hours and sometimes into the night. It's tiring, but worth it, because you can make an enormous difference for Ukrainian defenders. We can spot where Russian forces are moving, denying them the element of surprise, and scout for assets such as air defenses and artillery for commanders to strike.\n\nRecon drone operators like us rely heavily on visual navigation. We study Pokrovsk so closely that, even when our drone is being spoofed, we can determine our flying location simply by the shape of the terrain or landmarks.\n\nWhen the foggy season comes, we try to make the most of any good visibility. Sometimes, you can get lucky and perform five flights in a five-day rotation.\n\nHowever, there were days when we found ourselves sitting in a house, just waiting for the weather to clear.\n\nYou can try to fly under the clouds, but going low means our bulky drones are more easily spotted and destroyed. Since we have limited tools, we try to preserve them and not use them recklessly.\n\nStill, on days with strong winds, there's a chance that the clouds may break slightly and give you glimpses of the battlefield. Sometimes, when visibility is bad but not impossible to work with, we must risk flying in such weather, especially if our troops are defending against a major assault.\n\nIn late summer, the situation in Pokrovsk was becoming increasingly problematic, both on the ground and in the sky. Back in the day, we would help long-range artillery focus on the Russian rear.\n\nI began to notice that Russia's tactics were making an impact around September.\n\nAcross the warzone, their strategy is to find our limit and overwhelm it with the smallest number of soldiers needed to seize our positions.\n\nIt is simple mathematics. Initially, they would send around 10 soldiers. If that wasn't enough, they would send 20. Then they would try 30.\n\nDay by day, they increase the number of troops and equipment. Their goal is to create a situation where we don't have enough drones to counter the amount of attacking infantry.\n\nTo eliminate an assault of 50 guys, all spread out, we'd need at least 150 drones and artillery, which is difficult for us to organize with our limited resources.\n\nWhen we were working in Pokrovsk, there were already areas of the city where the Russians had advanced, so the fighting area was porous and undefined.\n\nIf we had more troops, we could have held out for much longer and performed more aggressive maneuvers.\n\nIf we had more recon drones, our team could have flown over Pokrovsk nonstop, working despite the clouds.\n\nWith more first-person-view strike drones, our pilots could continue to find and attack the Russians closer to the ground.\n\nBut we don't have enough. So, we need other strike tools besides FPV drones, even though they account for about 80% of our kills on Russians.\n\nIronically, some of these tools have disappeared because warfare has changed so much. Mortars might have helped, but we mostly stopped using them — the battlefield is now so transparent that it is a suicide mission to ride around close to the front line in your pickup truck with a mortar.\n\nWhat we definitely need is artillery ammunition. Last year, some HIMARS units I worked with were rationed to four strikes a week.\n\nOther artillery units were limited to just three artillery shells a day. We would find them a target, and they would say: \"We don't have any more for today. Sorry, guys.\"\n\nThe weather in this season means it is still what drone pilots call our \"low season.\" At the same time, the terrain is now not too muddy, so it is the perfect time for Russians to attack.\n\nThis month, I am redeploying to Dnipro. The fight continues.",

    "description": "Ukraine said the \"Geran-5\" bears similarities to Iran's Karrar attack drone, and uses a more powerful engine than Russia's current turbojet Shaheds.",
    "fullText": "Russia has attacked Ukraine with a new type of long-range drone that uses a powerful jet engine to fly 600 miles with a 200-pound explosive warhead, Kyiv's military intelligence agency said.\n\nThe Ukrainian intelligence directorate, or GUR, released a statement on Sunday providing new details about what it dubbed the \"Geran-5.\"\n\nGUR said the drone was used during an attack in early 2026.\n\n\"Unlike previous modifications of the 'Geran' line, the device is made according to a normal aerodynamic scheme,\" GUR said, adding that the Geran-5 bears a strong resemblance to Iran's Karrar attack drone.\n\nPublished images showed wreckage of the apparent device on snow-laden ground, which included long fixed wings attached to a slender chassis. Business Insider could not independently verify the location and date of the images.\n\nThe Geran-5 is roughly 20 feet long, with a wingspan of about 18 feet, GUR added.\n\n\"The warhead weighs about 90 kg, and the declared range is about 1,000 km,\" the intelligence agency said.\n\nRussia's Geran drone family is most often associated with the Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munition. The Geran-1, Geran-2, and Geran-3 are inexpensive, mass-manufactured drones modeled after the Shahed but tweaked for production inside Russia.\n\nWhile the new drone's design differs significantly from that of the typical Shahed, GUR said it was being classified as a type of Geran because it shares many key components with Russian Shahed-like drones.\n\nThese include a jet engine made by Telefly, a Chinese company, and a microcomputer that GUR said is modeled after Raspberry Pi, a UK-designed low-cost computer that fits on a small board.\n\nThe Geran-3, a newer drone resembling Iran's Shahed-238, was earlier reported by Ukraine to use a Telefly JT80 turbojet engine that allows the device to fly at speeds of up to 230 miles per hour.\n\nGUR said the Telefly engine on the Geran-5 generates even more thrust, but did not give specifics about the drone's speed.\n\nUkrainian authorities have said that they've found Raspberry Pi 4 computers on Russia's more commonly used Geran-2s. These drones, modeled after the Shahed-136, are Russia's main tool in the hundreds-strong waves bombarding Ukraine and require computers for functions such as transmitting navigation data to operators.\n\nTelefly did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider. The Raspberry Pi Foundation did not respond to a similar request sent outside regular business hours.\n\nGUR said that the Geran-5 also uses 3G and 4G modems, as well as a 12-channel Comet, otherwise known as Kometa, satellite navigation system. The Kometa is typically known to use multiple antennas, which makes it more resistant to jamming.\n\n\"As with previous 'geraniums,' this UAV is difficult to consider as a Russian Federation development,\" GUR said.\n\nNotably, the intelligence agency said it had information that Russia is looking to launch the Geran-5 from another aircraft, such as the Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jet.\n\nUsing the drone in this way would likely greatly increase its operational range, since the Su-25 can fly out a distance before launching the Geran-5. Russia has typically been launching its older Gerans from ground-based ramps in Western Russia, annexed Crimea, and occupied Ukraine.\n\n\"Separately, the possibility of equipping the aircraft with R-73 air-to-air missiles to counter Ukrainian aviation is being considered,\" GUR said.\n\nThe R-73 is a Soviet-era heat-seeking missile, also known as the AA-11 Archer by NATO, designed to be fired from fighter jets to attack other aircraft.\n\nUkraine has previously said that it found Russia had mounted some of its Geran-2s with the R-60, an older air-to-air missile, to target aircraft such as helicopters trying to hunt down drones.",

    "fullText": "First came Russia’s “turtle tank”, a metal shed rumbling across the battlefield. Then Ukraine laughed at the so-called “hairy tank”, coated in long, wavy metal wires.\n\nNow the “dandelion tank” has arrived.\n\nMoscow’s latest crude design, which features flexible metal rods arranged in branched layers, attempts to shield the body of the tank from the ever-present threat of small kamikaze drones.\n\nIt may look ridiculous, but analysts say the Oduvanchik (dandelion) anti-drone armour might offer the best protection currently available for the expensive vehicles.\n\nIt is the latest in a series of odd-looking Russian inventions that have appeared over the past week, each inspiring some level of mockery online. They include a camouflage net disguised as rubble and a patent for giant rotating propellers to protect Soviet-era vans.\n\nBut in such a protracted and largely static war, which demands endless innovation at cheaper and cheaper costs, any edge may save lives at the front.\n\nThe unorthodox dandelion-inspired modification was pictured for the first time last week, covering a Russian T-90M tank inside a warehouse. It is unclear when it will be deployed for combat, but Russia’s defence ministry recently patented the design.\n\nThe reinforced metal rods are welded together to form a tree-like structure that branches out into several tiers, forming a three-dimensional barrier, like the florets of a dandelion. In any gaps, a high-strength mesh is stretched between them.\n\nIf an explosive-rigged FPV (first-person-view) drone flies towards the tank, the rods should detonate it at a distance, shielding the hull from most of the blast. For every extra inch the drone is kept away, the tank has a better chance of survival.\n\nOn top of a T-90’s significant base armour, Russia often adds explosive reactive armour and metal cages. Pair this with the dandelion defence and “you’ve got the best passive anti-drone protection currently available,” David Axe, a military correspondent, wrote on his blog, Trench Art.\n\nIt is an upgrade of the “hedgehog” armour, of thick broom-like bristles protruding from a vehicle’s side, used across the front by Russian forces last year, and later by the Ukrainians.\n\n“At the front, anything you can experiment with, all different kinds of spikes, chains, cages, or a mixture of all, that can save the lives of soldiers is worth doing,” said David Kirichenko, a Ukraine-Russia weapons expert.\n\n“Ukrainian soldiers once mocked the Russians for putting cages on their vehicles; now they are doing it too,” he told The Telegraph.\n\nUkrainian forces were pictured earlier this week showing off a new design on a large infantry fighting vehicle that featured dandelion-like anti-drone armour, hair-like bristles, and metal sheets hanging from chains.\n\n“It is a part of [the] endless development of experimental and wacky inventions by both sides,” said Mr Kirichenko. “There is a constant race to identify weaknesses, produce measures and countermeasures and adapt to changing battlefield conditions.”\n\nYet, as with many other anti-drone systems, there are drawbacks. All the extra gear adds to the vehicle’s weight, slowing it down and leaving it more exposed to the drones that haunt the front.\n\nPlus, the dandelion armour is far from impregnable. Ukraine is proving increasingly efficient at flying drones beneath tanks and vehicles to strike them from below, where the armour is weakest, or to use FPVs to drop mines in their path.\n\nValerii Riabykh, a Ukrainian weapons analyst and editor of Defence Express, also pointed out how such protection was “ineffective against traditional weapons, such as an artillery shell, especially a high-precision one.”\n\nBut when it comes to drones, he said: “It may be effective for some time until the opposing side picks up the key to this protection, or breaks it.”\n\nIt can disguise gun, artillery or infantry positions underneath a rug of fake smashed-up bricks that look like rubble and rubbish, hiding equipment from Ukrainian drone operators.\n\nMr Riabykh said that, like the dandelion tank, it would probably only be useful for a limited time.\n\nWith the rise of AI and image processing tools installed within drones, its specific features could automatically highlight the nets to drone operators, he said, becoming an “unmasking feature which will lead to even faster destruction of those who use them”.\n\nAnother rudimentary tactic that emerged last week is the use of large propellers mounted on the roof, front, rear and sides of civilian vehicles used at the front.\n\nShort on modern armoured vehicles, Russia has for two years been using vans, trucks and jeeps for front-line tasks. Such unprotected vehicles are easy targets for Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a Russian patent, when the drone attempts to attack a protected vehicle, “there is a high probability that he will enter the rotation zone of one of the blades”.\n\nAnalysts The Telegraph spoke to largely dismissed such a design, owing to how much of the van is exposed and the fact that the propellers probably cost more than the vehicle they are intended to protect.\n\nYet any modifications, no matter how seemingly trivial, could allow either side to buy time, said Mr Riabykh, “and time on the modern battlefield is everything”.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Russia said Friday it used its latest missile against Ukraine for a second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, a forceful signal to Kyiv and its Western allies as U.S.-led peace talks have entered a new and crucial stage.\n\nThe hypersonic Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile hit Ukraine's western Lviv region late Thursday night, although officials there did not mention any casualties. The area is near a military base in neighboring Poland, a NATO member, that serves as a key hub for ferrying Western military supplies to Kyiv.\n\nSome Moscow commentators said the attack was a warning to European leaders against proposals to deploy their troops to Ukraine as part of a prospective peace deal. Russia has said it won't accept such a deployment and would view those forces as legitimate targets.\n\nA look at the weapon and why Russia used it now:\n\nWhat’s known about the Oreshnik\n\nRussia first used the multiple-warhead Oreshnik on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in November 2024.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said the Oreshnik, which means “hazelnut tree” in Russian, streaks at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, “like a meteorite,” and was immune to any missile defense system.\n\nHe said the weapon is so powerful that several such missiles -- even fitted with conventional warheads — could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. He said it’s capable of destroying underground bunkers “three, four or more floors down.”\n\nThe Russian military said the Oreshnik can carry nuclear or conventional warheads and can reach any European target.\n\nThe Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019.\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Ukraine’s military said the missile had six independently targetable warheads, each carrying six submunitions.\n\nRussian military bloggers said the submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives.\n\nSince the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has used swarms of cheap slow-flying drones and an assortment of other missiles, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said last month the Oreshnik had been deployed to Belarus and entered active service. It didn't specify how many missiles were sent to the key ally of Moscow and whether they were fitted with nuclear warheads, but Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that up to 10 Oreshnik systems will be stationed there.\n\nRussia previously has stationed tactical nuclear weapons inside Belarus, whose territory it used to launch the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2024, Putin released a revised nuclear doctrine that placed Belarus under Russia's atomic umbrella. The document significantly lowered the threshold for the possible use of nuclear weapons, declaring that any nation’s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on the country. The threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons.\n\nUnlike Russia's other shorter-range conventional weapons, the Oreshnik is able to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether the missile is carrying a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target.\n\nRussia's message by using the Oreshnik\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Putin described it as a response to Ukraine's Western allies allowing it to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory.\n\nIts latest strike comes as the U.S.-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine have entered a pivotal stage and appears to underline Putin’s intention to negotiate from a position of strength as his troops make slow but steady territorial gains.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers noted that the strike in Lviv, not far from the Polish border, was a message intended for Kyiv’s allies. Those members of the “coalition of the willing” have proposed sending their troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees once a peace deal is reached.\n\nRussia has said it won't accept any European forces in Ukraine, seeing them as legitimate targets.\n\n“For the first time, NATO command has been shown a strategic weapons strike virtually on its border,” said military expert Valery Shiryayev. “This action is intended to demonstrate the determination of Russia’s military and political leadership to use such weapons with nuclear warheads if necessary.”\n\nThe attack comes less than a week after the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a Russian ally. The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the U.S. action as an act of aggression and sharply criticized Wednesday’s U.S. seizure of a Russia-flagged tanker.",

Putin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024.",
    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's launch of an Oreshnik hypersonic missile appears aimed at intimidating Ukraine and sending a signal of Russian military might to Europe and the United States at a crucial juncture in talks to end the war.\n\nPutin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024. Since then, it has kept the weapon in reserve.\n\nThe overnight Oreshnik strike in western Ukraine came after a week of setbacks for Russia. ‌On Saturday, President Donald Trump sent U.S. special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close Putin ally, and on Wednesday U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the north Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain and France announced plans to deploy troops in Ukraine ‌in the event of a ceasefire - prompting Moscow to respond that it would view foreign soldiers as legitimate combat targets.\n\nGerhard Mangott, a Russia specialist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said Moscow was frustrated at being sidelined during weeks of diplomacy between the U.S., Ukraine and the Europeans, and \"particularly mad\" about the planned potential troop deployment by Kyiv's European allies. The use of the Oreshnik should be seen in that context, he said.\n\n\"It's a signal to the United States and the Europeans about the military capabilities of the Russian army,\" Mangott said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe said Moscow wanted to convey that \"Russia is to be taken seriously, given its military arsenal, ⁠and that the Europeans and Trump should return to a minimum of respect ‌for the Russian position in the negotiations.\"\n\n'DESTRUCTION NOT NECESSARILY THE GOAL'\n\nThe Oreshnik is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, although there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the latest attack.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the missile struck a state enterprise in the western city of Lviv and ‍was likely carrying inert or \"dummy\" warheads - as in 2024, when Russia first fired it to test the weapon in war.\n\n\"It does appear that at this point Russia is using Oreshnik for signaling purposes, so the destruction is not necessarily the goal,\" Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, told Reuters when asked if the use of dummy warheads would diminish the capacity of Moscow's action to intimidate Ukraine and its allies.\n\n\"It's probably a general signal of resolve ​to escalate. My guess is that it will be read this way by the West,\" he said.\n\nWestern reaction to the attack, around 60 km (40 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland, was swift. ‌The leaders of Britain, France and Germany called it \"escalatory and unacceptable\". European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"a clear escalation against Ukraine and meant as a warning to Europe and to the U.S.\".\n\nRUSSIAN STATEMENT ON REASON FOR MISSILE USE DRAWS SCEPTICISM\n\nRussia specialist Mangott was sceptical about the official statement from Russia's Defence Ministry that the Oreshnik launch was in response to an alleged Ukraine drone strike targeting one of Putin's residences, in the northern region of Novgorod, late last month. Ukraine has denied any such attack took place, accusing Moscow of lying about it in order to derail peace talks.\n\nSeveral high-profile Russian war bloggers also criticised the official framing of the strike as a revenge attack. One, Yuri Baranchik, suggested it would have \"looked more convincing\" if Moscow had fired the missile at President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's bunker in Kyiv.\n\nMick Ryan, ⁠an Australian military expert, linked the weapon's use to Russia's recent setbacks, especially over Venezuela.\n\nHe said the point was \"to demonstrate ​that Russia remains a nuclear-armed world power. In this guise, it is a psychological weapon – an instrument of Putin’s cognitive war ​against Ukraine and the West – rather than a weapon of mass physical destruction.\"\n\nRussian arch-hawk Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Putin's Security Council, alluded in a social media post to the capture of Maduro, the oil tanker seizure by the U.S. and the possibility of further U.S. sanctions against Russia, which he ‍said had made for a \"stormy\" start to the year.\n\nIn ⁠comments highly critical of Washington, he said international relations had descended into a madhouse and compared the Oreshnik strike to \"a life-saving injection of haloperidol\", an anti-psychotic drug.\n\nProminent Russian war blogger Fighterbomber, a former military serviceman, said he thought the use of the Oreshnik was a display of power to convey a message and that Moscow would not be resorting to it often.\n\nHe noted that ⁠some Oreshnik systems had been transferred to Belarus and that Russia would have some of its own in reserve, but suggested that there was not an endless supply of the relatively new missile.\n\n\"Taking all these constants into account, we can assume that ‌we can afford to conduct such demonstrations two or three times a year,\" he wrote.\n\nHe expressed hope that no further launches would be needed for now, concluding: \"The signals have ‌been sent and they have been heard.\"",

    "description": "Ukrainian cities have set up hundreds of \"invincibility points\" in preparation for a rare mass blackout event like this week's.",
    "fullText": "A new wave of Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure has put two of its biggest regions to the test, as local cities rolled out plans for dealing with their worst blackouts in years.\n\nTheir prepared \"blackout mode\" response provides some insight into how urban centers might steel themselves for energy crises in wartime, especially during cold months. Ukraine's winter can turn brutal in January and February, when temperatures typically drop to 18°F.\n\nMass blackouts can also disrupt water and sewage systems, hospitals, public transportation, and road control, including traffic lights.\n\nBoth Ukrainian troops and civilians have long learned to cope with frequent energy shortages in the winter, maintaining backup generators, battery-powered lamps, and stockpiles of coal or gas.\n\nBut Moscow's latest attacks on Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk, two eastern Ukrainian regions, plunged both areas into almost total darkness this week.\n\nRegional leaders have described it as their biggest energy crisis since 2022, when Ukrainians first faced wartime power outages. Borys Filatov, the mayor of Dnipro, Dnipropetrovsk's largest city, said the situation there was one of the most severe in the country and had risen to the level of a \"national emergency.\"\n\n\"This is the first total blackout in the entire region in recent years,\" Ivan Fedorov, Zaporizhzhia's governor, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nAs national authorities reported that over 1 million people had lost heat and water, local officials rushed to restore power and open access to facilities prearranged for the blackouts.\n\nOne of their prepared responses was to deploy \"invincibility points,\" or earmarked emergency shelters equipped with heat, communication, and basic necessities.\n\nSome local governments publish a map with available locations for civilians. The city of Dnipro, for example, maintains a list of mostly schools, municipality buildings, and metro stations designated as safe spots.\n\nCivilians are meant to visit these shelters to \"warm up, charge your gadgets, and wait out the power outage,\" per the municipal government.\n\nA video published by Oleksy Kuleba, Ukraine's vice prime minister for reconstruction and the minister for community and territorial development, showed one point in Dnipropetrovsk that appears to be located in a small convenience store.\n\nKuleba said the region's energy sector had been hit with a \"massive blow,\" and that over 5,000 people visited 500 such locations in the city of Dnipro within 24 hours after the power outages began.\n\nKuleba added that neighboring regions in Ukraine had donated 45 generators to Dnipropetrovsk, where some of its trains had switched to burning onboard fuel for power.\n\nZaporizhzhia's governor, Fedorov, also said on Thursday that the region had 400 established invincibility points, with 200 ready for visitors within two hours.\n\n\"Residents could warm up, call their relatives, drink hot tea, and, if necessary, stay overnight,\" he said.\n\nFilatov, Dnipro's mayor, said on Thursday that the city had set up 130 water dispensers, which his staff marked on Google Maps, and that disrupted public transport would be temporarily replaced by buses.\n\nHospitals were already equipped with alternative power sources and necessities, while parts of the city, on the western bank of the Dnipro River, were supported by backup power, he added.\n\n\"The city's sewage system is also powered,\" Filatov said.\n\nNotably, Filatov said that while authorities had extended local school holidays to January 11, kindergartens would operate on four-hour shifts \"because it's clear that parents are also in a difficult situation.\"\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, Fedorov said the region had been left \"completely without electricity\" on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We immediately went into 'blackout' mode and started working according to a clear plan,\" he said.\n\nZaporizhzhia's hospitals similarly switched to backup power within minutes, and the region's traffic lights \"worked autonomously,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian officials have since said that power has been partially returned to both regions, with Kuleba reporting on late Thursday evening that water and heating in Dnipropetrovsk had been restored to over 1.7 million people and 270,000 people, respectively.\n\nEnergy supplier DTEK said that around 700,000 families in the Dnipropetrovsk region once again had access to electricity, though it added that Russian bombing was continuing.\n\n\"An exhausting day for energy workers in the Dnipropetrovsk region,\" the company said.\n\nFedorov warned repeatedly on Thursday evening of incoming drone and guided missile strikes over Zaporizhzhia. He later said that Russia had carried out over 728 strikes, including drone attacks, artillery shelling, and multiple-launch rocket system strikes across Ukraine that day.\n\nBoth Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk are close to the southern and eastern front lines in Ukraine.\n\nKyiv has often accused Russia of specifically targeting energy infrastructure during the winter to exhaust and punish Ukrainian civilians, which is a war crime but is often difficult to prove.\n\nThe Kremlin has often responded that its strikes were intended for legitimate military targets, though the years have shown that critical facilities are regularly damaged or destroyed by the attacks.\n\n\"There is no military sense in such strikes on the energy sector, on infrastructure, which leave people without electricity and heating in winter conditions,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday.",

    "description": "Ukraine's commander in chief said December was the first month that its drones \"neutralized\" roughly as many Russians as were called up.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's top general said that for the first time in the war, its drones are killing or seriously wounding Russia's soldiers as fast as it can get new troops into the field.\n\nDrones are the top battlefield threat, responsible for the most casualties in this war. Ukraine relies heavily on them, especially the cheap first-person-view drones, as solutions to its manpower and equipment shortages.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Tuesday in a Telegram post that December was the first month in which Ukraine's uncrewed systems units \"neutralized\" about as many Russian servicemen as it called up in a month.\n\nHe said video confirmed 33,000 Russian losses last month. \"The real losses of the occupiers are greater,\" the general said.\n\nSyrskyi did not provide a number for the number of Russian soldiers called up. Business Insider is unable to independently confirm Syrskyi's claims.\n\nRussia hasn't provided official casualty figures. As for the number of new Russian soldiers sent to Ukraine each month, a US assessment put the number around 30,000 last April. In May, however, the Russian president said that the number was twice that. A Ukrainian intelligence assessment in December said that Russia fulfilled its 2025 mobilization target of 403,000, an average of more than 36,000 a month.\n\nRussia's armed forces in Ukraine are a mixed bag of contract soldiers who volunteer for the fight — Russia attracts volunteers with various perks, like signing bonuses — conscripts pulled in through draft cycles, and other sources. Russia has previously recruited people out of its prisons.\n\nThough exact losses are unclear, Ukrainian and Western intel assessments point to substantial attrition. Russia has a much larger population to draw soldiers from than Ukraine, which is also said to have suffered significant losses in this war. Some estimates put Russian losses at 1,000 troops a day.\n\nWhile Russia has a larger population to pull from, it has tried to avoid repeated large-scale involuntary mobilizations.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin publicly promised not to send conscripts to the front lines, fearing fallout. It has limited what Russia can do with them, even though widespread reporting and captured conscripts say assurances have been misleading.\n\nSyrskyi called 2025 a great breakthrough for Ukraine's drone war and pledged that it would not stop, with plans to grow capabilities further in 2026.\n\nHe said that in December, the number of targets that were hit or destroyed by drones rose by 31% and that the number of Russian personnel hit rose by more than 25%.\n\nSyrskyi said in November that uncrewed systems were responsible for about 60 % of all enemy targets hit. That figure has also been higher, at times, in front-line areas.\n\nDrones directly attack troops and equipment — either by carrying explosives or dropping weapons like grenades — and they also collect intelligence that shapes how armies employ other forces. Even inexpensive drones have had an outsized impact, destroying sophisticated, multimillion-dollar systems such as tanks.\n\nRussia and Ukraine are locked in a drone development race to field greater numbers and more advanced drones, as well as counter-drone technology.\n\nSyrskyi warned that Russia also has ambitious plans for its drones. He said that Russia copied Ukraine by creating a separate part of the military for uncrewed systems and said that it has 80,000 servicemen. He said Russia plans to expand that to 165,500 this year and to almost 210,000 by 2030.\n\nThere are so many drones in the sky that Ukrainian soldiers previously told Business Insider that they were sometimes unable to tell which side any belonged to and would instead try to bring them all down just to be on the safe side.",

    "fullText": "The lightning U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro can be seen as both a benefit and a burden for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose forces botched an attempt to capture Ukraine’s capital and topple its leader at the start of Moscow's invasion nearly four years ago.\n\nThe ouster of Maduro highlights another Kremlin failure to support an ally, following the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024 and last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran. With the U.S. determined to establish control over Venezuela, Russia stands to lose a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere, along with billions of dollars invested in its oil industry.\n\nBut President Donald Trump's actions in Venezuela also are causing unease in Western nations and giving the Kremlin fresh talking points to defend its war in Ukraine.\n\nIn addition, Trump’s interest in wresting control of Greenland from NATO ally Denmark also threatens to destabilize the alliance at the moment when the U.S.-led efforts to broker peace in Ukraine enter a pivotal stage, distracting its members from their efforts to support Kyiv and provide it with security guarantees.\n\nPutin himself hasn’t commented on the U.S. actions in Venezuela, which his diplomats have denounced as a blatant act of aggression. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president who serves as his deputy on the presidential Security Council, similarly rebuked Washington for trampling international law — but also complimented Trump on defending U.S. interests.\n\n“Even though Trump’s action is completely unlawful, he cannot be denied a certain consistency — he and his team are very aggressively upholding their country’s national interests,” Medvedev said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. said it seized two sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela, including one flagged to Russia in the North Atlantic.\n\nMoscow's ‘spheres of influence’\n\nSince 2014's illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that followed the ouster of a pro-Kremlin president in Kyiv, Putin has sought to justify his action by describing his neighbor as part of Russia’s sphere of influence where Western encroachment can’t be allowed.\n\nPutin has argued that just as the U.S. would bristle at any foreign military presence in the Western Hemisphere, Russia sees NATO’s expansion to its borders as a major security threat. He cited Ukraine’s bid to join the military alliance as a key reason behind his full-scale invasion of the country.\n\n“We have made it clear and unambiguous that further eastward expansion of NATO is unacceptable,” Putin said shortly before sending troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. “Are we the ones placing missiles near the U.S. borders? No, it’s the U.S. that has brought its missiles to our doorstep.”\n\nLong before the invasion, Russia tested the ground on a possible deal under which it would refrain from meddling in Latin America in exchange for the U.S. offering Moscow free rein in Europe.\n\nFiona Hill, who oversaw Russia and Europe on Trump's National Security Council during his first term, testified before Congress in 2019 that the Russians were signaling their willingness to make such an arrangement involving Venezuela and Ukraine.\n\nRussia never made a formal offer, Hill told The Associated Press in an interview, but Moscow’s then-ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, “hinted ... many times” to her that Russia could cede its influence in Venezuela to the U.S. in exchange for a sphere of influence in Europe.\n\nShe said Trump's administration wasn’t interested in the Russian overtures that she described as a “hint-hint, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, how-about-doing-a-deal” offer. In April 2019, Hill was sent to Moscow to convey the message that “nobody’s interested. ... Ukraine and Venezuela are not related to each other.”\n\nHill said she did not know if the winds have now changed and whether there was any deal between the U.S. and Russia to swap spheres of influence in Venezuela and Ukraine, but she noted that many officials, including herself, who were involved in “restraining” Trump in his first term aren't around for his second.\n\nShe argued that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio would likely be the only member of the Trump administration who would now resist such a proposal, but added that others, including Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, could have a different view.\n\n“Who knows what Witkoff and others have been chatting about recently?” Hill asked.\n\nBefore Maduro was captured, AP reported Russia had started evacuating families of diplomats from Venezuela. When asked about the move, Hill said it would not be “implausible” that Witkoff gave Moscow a “courtesy heads-up.”\n\nSam Greene, a Russia expert at King’s College London, observed that Moscow may have backed down on Venezuela in the expectation of the U.S. giving it a free hand on Ukraine.\n\n“My worry is that it may be part of a tacit agreement, by which Washington, Moscow and Beijing agree not to deter one another against interventions in their putative spheres of influence,” he wrote on X.\n\nRussia’s foothold in Western Hemisphere\n\nBefore the invasion of Ukraine, senior Russian officials had issued vague warnings that Moscow could deploy troops or military assets to Cuba and Venezuela — statements that the U.S. dismissed as bluster. Some drew parallels to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis — when the Soviet Union deployed missiles to Cuba and the U.S. imposed a naval blockade of the island.\n\nRussian-Cuban ties withered after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, plunging Cuba into a grueling depression. Soon after his first election in 2000, Putin ordered the closure of a Soviet-built military surveillance facility in Cuba as he sought to improve ties with Washington. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies mounted, however, Moscow again intensified trade and other contacts with Cuba and sent warships to visit the island.\n\nRussia also has invested heavily in Venezuela's oil industry, as did China, and offered Caracas generous loans to purchase top-of-the-line air defense missiles, fighter jets and other weapons. On several occasions, most recently in 2018, it dispatched its nuclear-capable Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela in a projection of force.\n\nMilitary experts have said, however, that any attempt by Russia to establish a permanent military foothold in the Western Hemisphere would face overwhelming logistical challenges.\n\nThe ‘might-makes-right’ doctrine\n\nThe U.S. seizure of Maduro and his wife was seen worldwide as the return of the “might- makes-right” doctrine, backing Moscow’s argument that its action in Ukraine protects its vital interests the way the U.S. did in Venezuela.\n\nAfter its action in Venezuela, the U.S. has “nothing to formally reproach our country for,” Medvedev noted.\n\nHill noted that Maduro’s capture makes it harder for countries to condemn Russia’s action in Ukraine because “we’ve just had a situation where the U.S. has taken over — or at least decapitated the government of another country — using fiction.”\n\nAn indictment accuses Maduro and others of working with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S.\n\nFyodor Lukyanov, a Kremlin-connected, Moscow-based foreign policy expert, observed that “if we consider what’s happening from the perspective of setting a precedent, then we couldn’t ask for anything better, and this includes Trump’s conviction that the authorities in Venezuela must be approved by Washington.”\n\nRussian hawks, meanwhile, argue the U.S. action in Venezuela has created a new sense of urgency for Moscow to dramatically speed up its offensive in Ukraine.\n\n“Ukraine under our full control is our pass to the Great Powers club,” Alexander Dugin, a hard-line nationalist ideologue, wrote in a commentary.\n\nAP European Security Correspondent Emma Burrows in London contributed.",

    "description": "A Ukrainian F-16 pilot said the initial tactics taught by NATO were based on wars that were \"fundamentally different\" from Ukraine's fight.",
    "fullText": "One of Ukraine's first F-16 pilots said they had to create new tactics for the fighter because the West's original training didn't fit the war against Russia.\n\nUkraine's air force released a video interview on Monday with the pilot, whose name wasn't disclosed, in which he spoke about the F-16 Fighting Falcon's performance and the early challenges he faced when learning to fly the aircraft.\n\nThe pilot said he flew Kyiv's Soviet-made combat aircraft in the initial days of Russia's full-scale invasion, before being sent abroad to train to fly the F-16s donated by the West.\n\nOnce he returned to the war, he and his fellow pilots \"encountered reality,\" he said.\n\n\"The tactics that we were taught abroad do not entirely fit the war we have here, because those tactics are also based on wars in which the partners previously took part,\" the pilot said. \"And this war is fundamentally different from those wars.\"\n\nUkrainian pilots had to devise their own tactics, he said.\n\n\"How we would destroy cruise missiles, strike drones, how we would fight with the enemy near the line of combat contact,\" the pilot added.\n\nUkraine's Western allies have been taking note of some of those lessons, he added.\n\n\"When the partners see our effectiveness, they understand how, in our limited conditions, we are able to carry out flights with such effectiveness,\" he said. \"And they even, I would say, learn from us. They learn the tactics and adjust the tactics that they taught us when we were abroad.\"\n\nThe pilot didn't go into exact detail about the types of new tactics Ukrainians developed for the F-16, but spoke about a daring maneuver he recently conducted in the Donbas region.\n\nHe said his three-ship formation had encountered heavily saturated Russian defenses, including surface-to-air missile systems and unspecified air assets, that \"did not allow us the possibility to approach\" their target.\n\n\"We drew two missiles from the enemy, because there were two launches from different directions, and we gave the opportunity for our strike aircraft to destroy the target,\" he said.\n\nThe pilot said the entire group returned safely after the mission.\n\nUkraine has officially received 44 of the 87 F-16s that European nations have promised to donate to Kyiv. Its first crews for the American-made aircraft were trained in Romania, where a coalition of NATO member states, including the US, worked to teach Ukrainian pilots, technicians, and other staff to service and fly the planes.\n\nIn his interview, the pilot said the language barrier was one of his biggest challenges when learning to fly the F-16, and that while waiting to be sent abroad for training, he studied English grammar, colloquial language, and aviation terms as he rested between combat flights.\n\n\"It was very hard, because after a combat sortie, as a rule, a pilot has to rest, because he does not know whether at some moment he might fly again,\" he said.\n\nThe first of Ukraine's F-16s entered the war in August 2024 and were primarily used for defensive purposes against strike drones and cruise missiles.\n\nKyiv has since lost four of the aircraft, but its pilots have also been recorded achieving notable feats, including one reportedly destroying six missiles in a single flight.\n\nThe interviewed pilot praised the F-16 as a fighter that performs \"flawlessly,\" but also said he wished for the more advanced, Block 70/72 version of the aircraft. These latest iterations have been upgraded with fifth-generation technology, including powerful radars with stronger jamming resistance and a modernized cockpit.\n\n\"If we were given such an opportunity to carry out tasks on these aircraft, I think that in our tally there would be not only destroyed strike drones and cruise missiles, but also enemy aircraft that are carrying out tasks along the line of combat contact,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is now on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Moscow as his administration continues to negotiate a deal to end the war that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he met with Trump at the White House earlier Wednesday, during which the president “greenlit” the Russia sanctions bill that has been in the works for months.\n\nGraham had signaled previously that Trump has blessed the bill, only for it to encounter additional obstacles. But a White House official confirmed to The Associated Press Wednesday that the president supports the sanctions legislation.\n\n“This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent,” Graham said in a statement, referring to the Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe bill, chiefly written by Graham and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., allows the administration to impose tariffs and secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russia’s oil, gas, uranium and other exports. Doing so is meant to cut off the source of financing for much of Russia’s military actions.\n\nThe White House has previously insisted on some revisions and flexibility for Trump in the sanctions package, but the White House official on Wednesday did not elaborate on whether any changes were secured.\n\nThe legislation has dozens of co-sponsors in the Senate, as well as a companion bill in the House, drafted by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.\n\nGraham said there could be a vote as early as next week, although it’s unclear how likely that will be. The Senate is poised to take up a scaled-back government funding package next week that the House is currently considering, if the House passes it. The following week is a Senate recess timed to Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently trying to finalize a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, now nearly four years old, with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, as the U.S. president’s chief negotiators.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range, deep-strike drones to hit a Russian missile arsenal and oil depot supporting the invasion, a security official told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe attacks mark Ukraine's latest deep strikes as it continues to target Russian weapons and the country's vast energy sector, a major revenue source for the state as it wages war.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, said that drones hit Russia's 100th Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU) in the western Kostroma region. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe drone attack on the facility triggered a secondary detonation of ammunition, causing powerful blasts at the facility, the source said, calling it an important target because Russia uses it to supply munitions to smaller sites in other areas of the country.\n\nThe source said drones also struck an oil depot in the nearby Lipetsk region, sparking an \"intense\" blaze. Video footage and images shared on social media appeared to show fire and smoke at the two facilities.\n\nOvernight, Ukrainian attack drones successfully hit a Russian oil depot in the town of Usman, Lipetsk Oblast. Seen here, flames leap into the night sky from the burning facility. pic.twitter.com/EN6SRI2sXU\n\nRussia's defense ministry said on Tuesday that it shot down 360 Ukrainian drones without specifying where. Neither the ministry nor the Russian embassy in the US responded to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe SBU source said that the two drone attacks were carried out by its Alpha group, an elite \"spetsnaz\" unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces.\n\nThe Alpha group regularly carries out long-range drone attacks against Russian targets, including a recent first-of-its-kind strike on a Moscow-linked oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea and the stunning June attacks against Russian airbases, known as Operation Spiderweb.\n\nThe SBU's Alpha forces also carry out ground operations; for instance, they have participated in Ukraine's defense of Pokrovsk, the war-torn city in the eastern Donetsk region that has been the site of some of the conflict's most intense fighting.\n\n\"In the New Year, the SBU continues to work successfully on military and oil facilities of the Russian Federation, reducing the enemy's ability to provide their army with ammunition and fuel,\" the source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\n\"All Russian rear facilities that work for the war against Ukraine are absolutely legitimate targets,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drones to attack Russian energy facilities in a bid to put pressure on a key source of revenue for Moscow that helps fuel its war efforts.\n\nUkraine has mostly targeted oil and gas infrastructure on land, such as depots and ports, but in recent weeks, it has expanded attacks to maritime targets, striking several oil tankers and oil platforms in the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the deep-strike operations as the country's way of imposing \"long-range\" sanctions on Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday's attack on the 100th GRAU arsenal reflects a tactic that Ukraine has long relied on — hitting ammunition storage sites inside Russia to cause more near-term battlefield impacts.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy replaced the head of his powerful security agency on Monday, pressing ahead with a reshuffle of top officials as Russia's war in Ukraine nears the four-year mark with ​no end in sight despite intense diplomacy.\n\nThe removal of Vasyl Maliuk, who oversaw a series of assassinations and a surprise ‌operation codenamed \"Spiderweb\" that destroyed Russian warplanes, shakes up the leadership of a vast security agency at the heart of Ukraine's shadow war.\n\nZelenskiy named Major-General Yevhenii Khmara as the acting ‌head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), which Maliuk had run since 2022. The agency described Khmara as an experienced commander who had served in the elite Alfa combat unit since 2011 and led it since 2023.\n\nSOME COMMANDERS STAND BY MALIUK\n\nZelenskiy said on X he had asked Maliuk to focus on combat operations, adding: \"There must be more Ukrainian asymmetric operations against the occupier and the Russian state, and more solid results in eliminating the enemy.\"\n\nZelenskiy ⁠last week named military spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as ‌his chief of staff to replace Andriy Yermak, who was ousted in November amid a corruption scandal but denied wrongdoing.\n\nNew defence and energy ministers will also be named in a reshuffle that had been put on hold ‍during negotiations on a possible peace deal that produced no sign of a breakthrough.\n\nRussia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, holds about one-fifth of Ukrainian territory including Crimea, which it seized in 2014. Kyiv says the advances have come at huge losses for Russia.\n\nZelenskiy has also appointed First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsia ​as a first deputy to Budanov, bringing a member of Ukraine's negotiating team into his administration.\n\nSome commanders rushed to Maliuk's defence after ‌reports of his looming exit circulated at the weekend.\n\nDrone forces chief Robert Brovdi said replacing him risked weakening \"one of Ukraine's key contemporary heavyweight\" agencies fighting Russia.\n\nSolomiia Bobrovska, a lawmaker on the defence, security and intelligence committee, said she did not think Maliuk's removal was \"necessary today\".\n\n\"In my opinion, under Maliuk's leadership, the SBU has been doing its job successfully in the current political situation, balancing between political tasks, combat operations and economic issues,\" she told Reuters.\n\nShe said Zelenskiy had effectively bypassed parliament by appointing Khmara as placeholder by decree.\n\nMaliuk, a career SBU official, overhauled the ⁠SBU after replacing Ivan Bakanov, who was dismissed by Zelenskiy in July 2022 ​for failing to root out Russian spies.\n\nMaliuk's most sophisticated operation, Spiderweb, used small drones ​hidden in cargo trucks to attack dozens of Russian highly valuable strategic bombers at airbases far from Ukraine's usual strike capabilities in May 2025.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously, told Reuters Maliuk had been asked to run the smaller ‍foreign intelligence service instead of the ⁠SBU, but declined.\n\nThe foreign spy service has no chief after its previous head was put in charge of the military intelligence agency. The head of the border guard service has also been replaced, another sign of the extensive security and defence reshuffle underway.\n\nMykhailo ⁠Fedorov, Zelenskiy's choice as defence minister, has not yet been approved by parliament. Zelenskiy said on Monday he wanted him to focus on technology and innovation to \"counter Russia's ‌desire to make this war endless.\"",

    "description": "The push for tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a \"significant increase\" in tax collection and compliance this year as Russia's wartime economy continues to lose momentum.\n\nThe Kremlin announced the directive on Saturday following an early December meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects.\n\nA share of that increase is set to come from higher consumption taxes, which rose from 20% to 22% on January 1. This bump is expected to generate about 1 trillion rubles, or $12.3 billion, in tax revenues.\n\nRussia is also planning to introduce a new tax on electronics in September.\n\nThe push for more aggressive tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhile Russia's sanctions-hit wartime economy appeared resilient in the first years of the war, cracks are emerging as persistently low oil prices are taking a toll.\n\nIn November, GDP expanded by just 0.1% from a year ago, according to official data. Industrial output declined 0.7%.\n\nIn the third quarter, Russia's GDP grew 0.6% from a year ago — sharply lower than the 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first.\n\nPutin has also ordered officials to restore economic growth and investment activity, while addressing structural problems across key sectors of the economy.\n\nAt the same time, the government is expected to keep inflation in check, with the target rate by the end of 2026 set within the central bank's forecast range of 4% to 5% — down from below 6% expected in 2025 and 9.5% in 2024.\n\nOil prices fell 20% in 2025 due to ample supply and slowing demand growth.\n\nDevelopments in the global oil market could add to that pressure. The US raid on Venezuela over the weekend is set to change the calculus for energy markets.\n\n\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry wrote on Monday that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid- to long-term. He said tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nThat view was echoed by John E. Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who pointed to President Donald Trump's plans for Venezuelan oil.\n\n\"Trump has said he intends to put Venezuelan oil — still under tough sanctions — back on the market,\" wrote Herbst on Monday.\n\n\"While this may take some time, it will help him reach his goal of driving down oil prices for US (and therefore global) consumers. This will be another big hit to the Russian economy,\" he added.\n\nVenezuela holds some of the world's largest oil reserves. But analysts say reviving the country's oil industry could take years due to aging infrastructure, decades of under-investment, sanctions, and political instability.",

    "fullText": "ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday told reporters that U.S. officials have determined that Ukraine did not target a residence belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week, disputing Kremlin claims that Trump had initially greeted with deep concern.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last week said Ukraine launched a wave of drones at Putin’s state residence in the northwestern Novgorod region that the Russian defense systems were able to defeat. Lavrov also criticized Kyiv for launching the attack at a moment of intensive negotiations to end the war.\n\nThe allegation came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had traveled to Florida for talks with Trump on the U.S. administration's still-evolving 20-point plan aimed at ending the war. Zelenskyy quickly denied the Kremlin allegation.\n\nTrump said that “something happened nearby” Putin's residence but that Americans officials didn't find the Russian president's residence was targeted.\n\n“I don’t believe that strike happened,\" Trump told reporters as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his home in Florida. “We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.”\n\nTrump addressed the U.S. determination after European officials argued that the Russian claim was nothing more than an effort by Moscow to undermine the peace effort.\n\nBut Trump, at least initially, had appeared to take the Russian allegations at face value. He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.\n\nThe U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nBut Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian military leader on Putin’s hit-list conned the Kremlin out of $500,000 by faking his own death to collect the bounty, Kyiv revealed on Thursday.\n\nDenis Kapustin, a far-right military commander and founder of the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), a battalion of far-right Russians who fight for Ukraine against Putin, was reported to have been killed in a drone strike in Zaporizhia on December 27 after spending months atop the Kremlin’s most wanted list.\n\n“We will definitely avenge you, Denis,” the RVC wrote in a Telegram post ‘confirming’ Kapustin’s death. “Your legacy lives on.”\n\nBut in a stunning twist, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) revealed on Thursday that the assassination of Kapustin, 41, had instead been part of an elaborate hoax cooked up by Kyiv to save the militia leader’s life and trick Russia into paying them a half-a-million dollar bounty that had been placed on his head.\n\n“Welcome back to life,” HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov announced in a video on January 1, congratulating Kapustin on bamboozling the Kremlin.\n\n“First of all, Mr. Denis, congratulations on your return to life. That is always a pleasure. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle,” he said. “I wish us all and you personally success.”\n\nBudanov, who described Kapustin as a “personal enemy” of Vladimir Putin, said the plot had taken more than a month to organize and that the commander would promptly return to the frontlines to continue his duties after swindling the Kremlin out of its cash.\n\nKapustin, better known by his callsign of ‘White Rex,’ also confirmed his role in the plot and said his “temporary absence” had not affected his unit’s effectiveness on the battlefield.\n\n“I am ready to move to the area of operations and continue commanding the RDK,” he said.\n\nFormed in 2022, the RVC was one of several international brigades composed of dissident Russians who took up arms against Putin and played a key role in cross-border excursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Kursk regions in 2023 and 2024.\n\nBut Kapustin, who has been formally named a terrorist by the Russian government, has long been considered a controversial ally to Ukraine due to his association with several neo-Nazi and far-right groups, which saw him banned from entering almost the entire European Union, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain, in 2019 because of his extremist views.\n\nThe RVC describes its members as holding “conservative views and traditionalist beliefs” but has denied accusations of neo-Nazism, instead claiming their goal is to establish a “true nation-state for Russians” that “lives in peace with the nations that surround it.”\n\n“I have my set of views, it’s a patriotic set of views, it’s a traditionalist set of views, it’s a right-wing set of views,” Kapustin told Al Jazeera in 2023.\n\n“You’ll never find me waving a flag with a swastika, you’ll never find me raising my hand in a Hitler sign. So why would you call me that?”",

    "description": "The UK military expected to see more high-end Russian equipment, like T-14s and Su-57s, in Ukraine, an officer said. They're not there though.",
    "fullText": "A British Army officer said that the military was surprised it did not see more advanced Russian weaponry, like some of its best tanks, on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\n\"We probably would've expected to have seen more of their prestige equipment,\" Maj. Maguire told Business Insider, speaking on the condition that only his rank and last name be used. He previously helped lead the UK-led training for Ukrainian soldiers and also produced reports for the UK and allies on tactics in Ukraine and the lessons Western forces could draw from them.\n\nOne example he gave of Russian equipment that hasn't been seen is the T-14, considered Russia's most advanced tank.\n\nThat kind of warfighting equipment is what the British military sort of sees as \"the pacing threat equipment that we train against.\"\n\nThe T-14, estimated to cost between $5 million and $9 million, is regarded as one of Russia's best tanks. Western analysts had worried the tanks might rival NATO's most advanced tanks. Russian state media has often touted the Armata as \"cutting edge.\"\n\nYet these weapons haven't been seen in the war. Sergei Chemezov, the CEO of Rostec, which produces the Armata, previously said the tanks might not be well-suited for Ukraine.\n\n\"Armata is, in general, a little expensive,\" he said. \"In terms of functionality, it is, of course, much superior to existing tanks, but it is too expensive, so the army is unlikely to use it now.\"\n\nThe UK expected this kind of prestige equipment, but instead these tanks \"haven't really been used, and I think that's probably more surprising than the fact that they've used a lot of their stockpiles and stuff,\" Maguire said.\n\nThe Russians have relied heavily on tanks like T-90s and T-80s, as well as some decades-old equipment, some first deployed in the 1940s. It has been pulling old tanks out of storage rather than putting its most capable assets, at least on paper, out onto the battlefield.\n\nIts stores are vast, with numerous tanks built for a Cold War fight, and building new tanks is a long process, even with Russia's ramped-up defense industry output. Sophisticated machinery takes time to build, and the Western sanctions at crippling the industry don't make it any easier.\n\nMaguire did not speculate on why Russia is not using the T-14, but the UK Ministry of Defence has previously weighed in.\n\nIt said last year that the Armata's absence was \"highly likely due to the potential reputational damage of losing the 'prestige' vehicle in combat and the requirement to produce greater quantities of MBTs which can only be satisfied by other variants.\"\n\nAn earlier ministry intelligence update that Russian troops in Ukraine were reluctant to accept the first tranche of T-14s that were offered to them \"because the vehicles were in such poor condition.\"\n\nRussia's confidence in the tank is unclear; however, it notably reduced its own order for the tanks, instead focusing on modernizing older types. Western analyses say the tank is impressive but also appears to be more vulnerable than Russia has said.\n\nThe war has not been kind to tanks and other armored vehicles. It is a fight in which neither side has achieved air superiority and cheap drones and mines threaten anything that moves. Considering the substantial losses, cost-effective mass has often proven more valuable than exquisite combat power.\n\nBeyond the T-14, Russia also hasn't sent in its fifth-generation fighters, its Su-57s. These aircraft are built for this kind of war, where air defenses make the skies extremely dangerous for older fourth-gen jets. Russia hasn't made the progress it hoped for in Ukraine, yet these planes are still largely sitting out the fight.\n\nThe UK defense ministry said in 2023 that the Su-57's usage seemed limited to Russian territory and launching long-range air-to-surface or air-to-air missiles into Ukraine. It said Russia was \"highly likely prioritising avoiding the reputational damage, reduced export prospects, and the compromise of sensitive technology which would come from any loss\" of the jet over Ukraine.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the Su-57 stealth and combat capabilities, with some speculation that it may not be a true fifth-gen aircraft. A former UK air force officer turned analyst previously told Business Insider that Russia was likely saving them for a possible conflict with NATO.\n\nWhen it comes to the high-level equipment Russia isn't using, Maguire said, \"I have no idea why they're not using it, but I'm pretty sure whatever it is, we could defeat it with what we have.\"\n\nRussia has put some advanced systems into the war; however, the few weapons that have made an appearance haven't \"performed very well,\" the major said.\n\nHe pointed to Ukraine's destruction of Russia's newly developed BMPT \"Terminator\", a 23-foot-long armored vehicle carrying a host of weapons. Ukraine has also been able to shoot down the Kinzhal missiles Russia boasted were unstoppable with Patriots, and Russia's S-400 air defense system, while still formidable, has somewhat underperformed.\n\nRussia's military in general has underperformed compared to Western expectations, including in its failure to quickly overpower Ukraine, which has left it bogged down in a grinding fight in the east. NATO officials also say the quality of its military has degraded throughout the war, though others have noted its learning too, making it a threat the West is watching closely.",

    "description": "Drones have turned the front line into a kill zone, and made casualty evacuation extremely difficult and dangerous.",
    "fullText": "NATO forces would likely see heavier losses than Ukraine has in a war with Russia, a senior officer told Business Insider, and that possibility is driving a rethink of battlefield medical care.\n\nDrones are watching much of the front line, making it nearly impossible to get wounded troops access to medical care within the \"golden hour,\" the critical first 60 minutes after a severe injury when access to medical care may determine life or death.\n\nGolden hour is found only in books, said Ukrainian Col. Valerii Vyshnivskyi, the country's senior representative to the NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis Training and Education Centre (JATEC).\n\nNow, there's only a golden day or month, he continued. \"The battlefield is visible 100%. That's why medical evacuation cannot be done in the old way.\"\n\nThe sky above the battlefield is filled with drones of all types executing both reconnaissance and strike missions. That saturation means Ukrainians often have to wait for unfavorable weather conditions and poor visibility to evacuate casualties. Some solutions, such as ground robots, are becoming more popular, but those systems aren't without their problems. They are vulnerable to attack, they break down, and they are susceptible to jamming.\n\nIn a high-intensity conflict against Russia, NATO forces would probably face the same casualty evacuation issues that Ukraine is dealing with, Vyshnivskyi said. However, he believes the military alliance would suffer heavier combat losses, as such a war has the potential to be significantly more destructive.\n\nNow nearly four years into the war, neither Ukraine nor Russia has publicly disclosed how many of their soldiers have been killed or wounded in combat. However, the total losses across both sides are unquestionably high.\n\nUkraine has suffered an estimated 400,000 casualties, including up to 100,000 troops killed, according to figures reported over the summer. Russia's toll is even grimmer: the UK defense ministry said last month that Moscow has likely taken more than 1.1 million casualties since its 2022 invasion and is now losing over 1,000 troops a day.\n\nWestern leaders have warned that the carnage, while presently unfolding on the battlefield and in Ukrainian cities, could expand deeper into Europe.\n\n\"Russia could be ready to use military force against NATO within five years,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a speech last month, later adding that such a conflict would result in \"extreme losses.\"\n\nNATO is becoming increasingly aware of the threat that drones pose to the treatment and evacuation of wounded troops in armed conflict, and it is preparing to meet that challenge. The alliance is working to source solutions from the medical and defense industries to save lives on a drone-infested battlefield.\n\nCompanies from 20 nations submitted 175 applications to showcase solutions at an \"Innovation Challenge\" hosted by NATO Allied Command Transformation (ACT) and JATEC — a key initiative that uses real-time lessons from the war to inform Western defense planning — in London last month.\n\nTen finalists presented ideas, which included a portable system to treat kidney failure, a jury-rigged stretcher design for evacuation over rough terrain, a secure communications portal for medics, ballistic plates for makeshift shelter, and other innovative solutions.\n\nBritish Army Col. Niall Aye Maung, the medical branch head for NATO's ACT and the medical advisor to the alliance headquarters in Brussels, referred to the ideas as a \"system of systems,\" where there's no single solution for battlefield casualty treatment and medical care. Instead, they'd function together.\n\nACT officials are now examining how to overhaul the NATO medical system to meet the demands of a large-scale war, Maung told Business Insider — and they're turning to Ukraine's experience to find medical solutions, including through events like the innovation challenge.\n\nVyshnivskyi, the Ukrainian officer, said Western leaders and industry are starting to understand the challenges that Ukraine is dealing with on the battlefield.\n\nHowever, one of NATO's biggest problems, he said, is that building new capabilities takes far too long — much slower than the battlefield is changing.\n\nFor medical gear, the research and development process can be lengthy because items must undergo regulatory and legal processes to ensure their safety. Still, Maung said that most solutions NATO is looking for are commercial off-the-shelf products with dual-use applications in both civilian and military settings. This can speed up procurement timelines.\n\nQuicker procurement is something NATO is exploring well beyond medical capabilities, as allies look to keep pace with the evolution of war technology on the battlefield. Drones and other emerging technologies are at the center of these efforts.\n\n\"If we want to react and innovate at speed, we have to accept and respect that the speed of innovation in commercial markets and civilian markets is a lot faster than in traditional military markets, especially if you're looking at non-traditional armaments,\" Bart Hollants, NATO's innovation broker, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the Ukraine war continues, European militaries continue to buy up weapons and strengthen their defenses — especially nations along NATO's Eastern flank that border Russia — and prepare for the possibility of a larger war.\n\nRutte, NATO's secretary general, said during his speech last month that Europe needs \"to be ready\" because modern wars are \"no longer fought at arm's length.\"\n\n\"Conflict is at our door,\" he warned. \"Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured.\"",

Kyiv denied attacking civilian targets.\n\nSvetlana Petrenko, spokeswoman of Russia's main criminal investigation agency, the Investigative Committee, said in a statement that a Ukrainian drone strike on a café and hotel in the village of Khorly, where at least 100 civilians were celebrating New Year's Eve overnight into Thursday, killed 27 people, including two minors. A total of 31, including five minors, were hospitalized with injuries.\n\nA criminal probe on the charges of carrying out an act of terrorism has been opened, Petrenko said.\n\nKyiv denied attacking civilians. Spokesman of Ukraine’s General Staff, Dmytro Lykhovii, told Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne on Thursday that Ukrainian forces “adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law” and \"carry out strikes exclusively against Russian military targets, facilities of the Russian fuel and energy sector, and other lawful targets.”\n\nLykhovii said that General Staff has published an explicit list of targets that the Ukrainian army struck on the night of New Year’s Eve. The list did not include strikes on occupied parts of the Kherson region.\n\nLykhovii noted that Russia has repeatedly used disinformation and false statements to disrupt the ongoing peace negotiations.\n\nThe Associated Press could not independently verify claims made about the attack.\n\nRussia's accusations against Ukraine come amid a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Moscow alleged that Kyiv launched a long-range drone attack against a residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in northwestern Russia overnight from Sunday to Monday.\n\nKyiv has called the allegations of an attack on Putin’s residence a ruse to derail ongoing peace negotiations, which have ramped up in recent weeks on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nIn his New Year’s address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a peace deal was “90% ready” but warned that the remaining 10%, believed to include key sticking points such as territory, would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live.”\n\nTrump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that he, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner had a “productive call” with the national security advisers of Britain, France, Germany and Ukraine “to discuss advancing the next steps in the European peace process.”\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, Russia conducted what local authorities called “one of the most massive” drone attacks at Zaporizhzhia overnight.\n\nAt least nine Russian drones struck the city, damaging dozens of residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure, head of the regional administration, Ivan Fedorov, wrote on Telegram on Friday. There were no casualties, the official said.\n\nOverall, Russia fired 116 long-range drones at Ukraine last night, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said that 86 drones were intercepted, while 27 more have reached their targets.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry reported Friday that its air defenses intercepted 64 Ukrainian drones overnight over multiple Russian regions.\n\nVyacheslav Gladkov, governor of Russia's Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine, on Friday also accused Ukrainian forces of carrying out a missile strike on the city of Belgorod. Two women were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said. The strike shattered windows in multiple residential buildings and damaged an unspecified “commercial” facility and a number of cars, according to the official.",

    "description": "Kyiv deception operation pays off as Moscow intelligence fooled by assassination claims",
    "fullText": "As far as the Russians were concerned, they had got their man.\n\nDenis Kapustin, one of the most prominent anti-Putin Russians fighting on behalf of Ukraine, was reported dead on Dec 27, assassinated by a drone on the southern front.\n\nHe had long been hunted by Moscow and the price on his head reflected this: Russian intelligence services had offered $500,000 (£370,000) to anyone who killed him.\n\nRussia paid this out after news broke of the successful hit this week. But what Vladimir Putin’s intelligence services did not know was that they had handed the money directly to Ukraine.\n\nMr Kapustin, known by his nom de guerre “White Rex”, founded the pro-Ukrainian Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) in 2022.\n\nThe group made headlines in 2023 and 2024 when it carried out cross-border incursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Kursk regions, humiliating the Russian president and his generals.\n\nHis death was first confirmed by the RDK itself. “We will definitely take revenge, Denis,” the group said on Telegram. “Your legacy lives on.”\n\nYet on New Year’s Day, in a morale-raising ruse, Mr Kapustin re-emerged – alive and unscathed – in a video posted by Ukraine’s military intelligence (HUR).\n\n“Welcome back to life,” Gen Kyrylo Budanov, head of HUR, said with a wry smile. He congratulated Mr Kapustin and his team on a successful operation to deceive their Russian adversaries.\n\nIt turns out HUR, along with the RDK, had hatched a plan to fake Mr Kapustin’s death and claim the $500,000 bounty from Russia for themselves, to be used in Ukraine’s war effort.\n\n“First of all, Mr Denis, congratulations on your return to life. That is always a pleasure. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle,” Gen Budanov added.\n\nRussia’s FSB and GRU agencies have long been feared for their ruthlessness.\n\nBut Ukrainian intelligence, throughout the near four-year war, has consistently proved its ability to outsmart their Russian counterparts, carrying out assassinations of generals and Kremlin officials on Russian soil, orchestrating complex sabotage operations and recruiting Russian agents.\n\nIn November, it was reported that Ukraine’s intelligence services used Russia’s own agents to accept missions offered openly by the FSB for financial reward and sabotaging its objectives.\n\nIn one case, a Ukrainian double-agent accepted a task from a Russia jobs board to build a bomb, which was then handed to a Russian saboteur.\n\nThe bomb, however, was made using flour and the Russian agent was captured by Ukraine after it failed to detonate.\n\nUkraine has also claimed responsibility for assassinations of high-ranking Russian officials, while Kyiv is suspected to have been behind many others.\n\nIn April, Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy chief of the main operations directorate of Russia’s army, was killed by a car bomb on Nesterov Boulevard in the Balashikha suburb of Moscow.\n\nBaza, a Russian media outlet with sources inside law enforcement agencies, said the home-made bomb was strapped to a parked Volkswagen car and detonated remotely when Moskalik, who lived in the neighbourhood, walked past.\n\nA month later, a former Ukrainian politician was shot dead in what appeared to be a professional hit job at the entrance of an exclusive school in Madrid.\n\nAndriy Portnov, a pro-Russian politician who worked as a close aide to the Moscow regime, was dropping off his daughters when an assassin shot him several times.\n\nThe shooting took place at the American School of Madrid while other parents were also making the school run.\n\nMost recently, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, 56, head ‍of the Russian army’s operational training ‍directorate, died in an explosion on Dec 22 in Moscow, probably planted by Ukrainian special forces.\n\nThe force of the explosion was such that at least seven cars parked nearby also sustained damage\n\nThe general worked in the Russian ministry of defence and participated in combat operations in Chechnya, Syria and Ossetia as well as Ukraine.\n\nAmong the most striking assassinations was the killing of Lt Gen Igor Kirillov on Dec 17 2024.\n\nThe officer, who was in charge of Russia’s nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, was killed by a remotely detonated device hidden inside an electric scooter.\n\n“Kirillov was a war criminal and an absolutely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against the Ukrainian military,” a Ukrainian security source said.\n\nIn a daring mission in June 2025 – dubbed Operation Spiderweb – Ukraine-operated drones destroyed several Russian surveillance aircraft and nuclear-capable bombers, with officials in Kyiv saying this rendered a third of Russia’s strategic cruise missile carriers useless.\n\nThe drones had been smuggled into Russia and assembled, and launched from trucks deep within Russian territory, in another huge victory for Ukraine’s spies.\n\nUkraine’s latest intelligence success means Denis Kapustin, a far-Right extremist and former football hooligan, is inside Ukrainian territory and “preparing to continue carrying out assigned tasks”, said a Ukrainian commander.\n\nThe commander’s family moved from Moscow to Germany when Mr Kapustin was 17 and he relocated to Ukraine in 2017.\n\nSince 2019, he has been banned from entering the Schengen Area for promoting neo-Nazi ideology.\n\nIn the early weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Mr Kapustin helped set up units that would become Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade that played a key role in defending Kyiv and later become renowned for its fierce fighting on the eastern front.\n\nResponding to reports of his death, the 3rd Army Corps said: “We together confronted the common enemy in the battle for Kyiv.”\n\nIt added on Dec 27: “He perceived [Ukraine] as a place of real resistance and freedom.”\n\nIn August 2022, Mr Kapustin set up the RDK, with the goal of overthrowing Putin to bring “peace to Russia”. Its stated aim is to end Putin’s regime of “lies, corruption, and lawlessness”.\n\nIt is made up of former Wagner Group recruits, some former FSB agents and civilian volunteers. It is deemed a terrorist organisation by Russia.\n\nRussian courts have twice sentenced Mr Kapustin to life imprisonment in absentia on treason and terrorism charges.\n\nIn March 2024, the RDK stormed into Russia alongside other anti-Kremlin militias on tanks and armoured vehicles. It clashed with Russian security services and captured Russian soldiers.\n\nKyiv has said that while it fights as part of Ukraine’s military, under its command, the incursions into Russia were not taking place under Kyiv’s orders.\n\nSince its incursions, the group is either fighting at the front or engaged in cross-border sabotage operations in Russia.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph in September, an RDK commander known as “White”, a 26-year-old Russian volunteer, described how he joined in order to exact revenge on Putin for invading Ukraine.\n\n“We fight to change something in Russia,” he said. “When the war ends, I will continue fighting until Putin falls.”",

    "description": "A New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.",
    "fullText": "United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addresses a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025 \n\nA New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart during which he seemed much more concerned with his appearance than policy.\n\nThe Times published a comprehensive story about the Trump administration’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday in which it suggested that Hegseth began his tenure at the Pentagon “as something of a blank slate on the war.”\n\n“He didn’t have any of his own thoughts on Russia and Ukraine,” an ex-Pentagon official told the Gray Lady. “But he had civilian advisers who did.”\n\nOn Day 4, the freshly minted defense secretary sat at a Pentagon conference table as one of his coterie of advisers argued for an immediate U-turn.\n\nThe ideological godfather of the group was Elbridge A. Colby, grandson of the Nixon-era C.I.A. director William E. Colby. The younger Mr. Colby and Mr. Vance had been introduced in 2015 by an editor at National Review who thought they were like-minded. Nearly nine years later, as Mr. Biden poured billions of dollars into arming Ukraine, Mr. Colby argued that “we would have been better served to put a lot more of that money to use in the Pacific.”\n\nNow, it was one of his disciples, Dan Caldwell, presenting the group’s recommendations to Mr. Hegseth, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other military leaders.\n\nThe Pentagon, Mr. Caldwell argued, should pause delivery of certain munitions that the Biden administration had promised to Ukraine, because, he believed, existing stocks were insufficient to execute America’s war plans around the world. Nor should it use the additional $3.8 billion left unspent by the Biden administration to buy weapons for Ukraine.\n\nGeneral Brown did not speak as Mr. Caldwell wrapped up. He simply shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\n\nDuring a trip to Europe the next month, Hegseth reportedly made sure to powder his nose for the cameras, but declined to answer Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov’s queries:\n\nThe Ukrainians had repeatedly requested a proper sit-down. Instead it would be a brief stand-up affair in an anteroom.\n\nBeforehand, according to an American official present, Mr. Hegseth dabbed his nose with powder from a small compact. “Look commanding,” he told one aide. The handshake with the Ukrainian might be shown on Fox; the president might be watching.\n\nThen the standing meeting began, Mr. Umerov coming in close, taking his voice down to a whisper, assuring the secretary that he knew America’s political and security agenda might be changing. He didn’t ask for new aid. He just needed to know one thing: Would the U.S. military continue to supply the munitions Ukraine was counting on, the ones approved by Mr. Biden? Every delivery sustained the lives of Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines; every delivery that didn’t arrive one day meant those soldiers would die the next.\n\nAgain and again, Mr. Umerov repeated his plea: “I just need you to be honest with me. Just be honest with me.”\n\nHegseth allegedly offered Umerov only nodding.\n\n“He wasn’t pleading for the answer that he wanted, but just for honesty, some indication,” observed one U.S. official. “He was saying: You can trust me; you can trust us. Just tell me what you guys are thinking.”\n\nThe post New York Times Deep Dive Alleges Pete Hegseth Donned Makeup for Ukraine Photo Op — Then Ignored Counterpart first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Russia is using helicopters to try to stop Ukraine's drones. Now its naval drones armed with missiles keep Russia's helicopters away, per a commander.",
    "fullText": "Russian helicopters are now steering clear of Ukraine's naval drones because they are vulnerable to the surface-to-air missiles some carry, a Ukrainian special forces commander said.\n\nThe commander, call sign Thirteen, leads \"Group 13,\" a special forces unit within Ukraine's defense intelligence agency, the GUR, that uses naval drones. He said that Russian helicopters initially \"posed a critical threat and made our work difficult.\"\n\nHowever, the naval drones evolved to counter the aircraft. Specifically, Ukraine armed them with missiles.\n\n\"After that, the enemy stopped using helicopters against us altogether, realising they had become easy targets for our missiles,\" Thirteen said. He spoke earlier this month at a GUR showcase about Ukraine's naval drones, and his comments were reported by Ukrainian outlet Pravda.\n\nThe commander did not specify when this change occurred, but his update indicates an increasingly successful role for Ukraine's pioneering naval drones. The drones achieved tremendous wins against Russian warships, forcing Russia to relocate its naval vessels and increase combat air patrols. Now, it appears the new missile-armed naval drones are seeing success in driving away the air patrols.\n\nUkraine claimed its first naval drone kill of a Russian helicopter last December, calling it a first worldwide. It said a Magura V5 sea drone destroyed a Russian Mi-8 helicopter with missiles. Ukraine has since claimed more helicopter hits with its naval drones.\n\nThe usefulness of helicopters has shifted throughout the war. Russia saw its Ka-52 attack helicopters defeat Ukrainian armor but also suffered losses to air defenses, the proliferation of which has made it extremely difficult for either side to take control of the skies.\n\nRussian helicopters, much like Ukraine's, have broadly been vulnerable to interceptors and drones, both aerial first-person-view (FPV) drones and now naval drones. They're increasingly employed with caution but still used for troop transport, logistical support, evacuations, armed support, air assault missions, and drone hunts.\n\nUkraine, for instance, has new helicopter units dedicated to shooting down Russian drones. Notably, though, they're engaging Shahed-style long-range one-way attack drones that Russia uses to attack cities, not front-line attack drones.\n\nThe naval drones' ability to shoot down helicopters reflects how rapidly the systems have evolved to hit a wider range of targets. Early in the war, the drones were used mainly as explosive-laden attack craft, ramming Russian warships and other vessels.\n\nAlong with aerial drones, they helped Ukraine blunt Russia's naval power despite Ukraine lacking a traditional navy, including by forcing much of Russia's Black Sea Fleet to withdraw to ports farther from Ukraine. The fleet used to be based in Sevastopol but is now positioned primarily at Novorossiysk.\n\nOver time, Ukraine has expanded the drones' capabilities by adding missile and rocket launchers, guns, and even other drones that can be launched from the vessels. New variants and missions have followed, including drones that have downed Russian fighter jets and others designed specifically to strike Russian assets on rivers.\n\nUkraine makes its own sea drones, including Magura variants and the Sea Baby. Russia has also gotten into the naval drone business, and the West is increasingly paying attention to the impact that the assets can have in war.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump struggled to offer much sympathy for the families of about 100 Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nAn estimated several thousand Americans have volunteered to fight for Ukraine since Russian dictator Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, with at least 92 Americans killed as of September, The New York Times reported.\n\nFollowing a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a peace deal to end the war, Trump was asked about his message to the families of the fallen Americans.\n\n“The message is so obvious,” he replied. “What a shame. They died in a foreign country. And some are celebrated people, they’re very celebrated. But it’s so sad that a thing like that would happen.”\n\nHe then immediately moved on to the next question.\n\nSocial media users quickly noted that the president hadn’t thanked the fallen for their sacrifice, praised their commitment to freedom and democracy, or even offered his personal condolences.\n\nMany of the Americans who have died in Ukraine were U.S. military veterans.\n\nMike Meoli, 71, was a retired Navy Seal and firefighter who traveled to Ukraine to train medics on the front lines. He was killed in November 2024, ABC 10 News San Diego reported.\n\nNicholas Maimer, 45, was an Army Special Forces veteran and Idaho native who helped train Ukrainian officers. He was killed in May 2023 in an artillery barrage, according to Military.com.\n\nIan Frank Tortorici, 32, was a retired corporal with the U.S. Marines who fought on the front lines. He died in July 2023 after a Russian missile hit a restaurant where he was eating while on leave, Task and Purpose reported.\n\nThe U.S. government has declined to provide aid to American fighters to avoid any suggestion of a direct clash with Russia, which is a nuclear power, the Times reported in September.\n\nBut some social media users argued that Trump’s barely-there compassion for their families wasn’t measured diplomacy—it was reminiscent of the president’s previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during World War I were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.\n\nAlthough he failed to offer much comfort Sunday to the families of Americans who have died fighting Russia, Trump did manage to heap praise on the man who started the war.\n\n“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, prompting Zelensky to raise an eyebrow. “I was explaining to the president [Zelensky], President Putin was very generous in his feeling toward Ukraine succeeding.”\n\nHe also said he “understands” Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire while a longer-term agreement is being hashed out.\n\n“He feels that look, you know, they’re fighting and to stop, and if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn’t want to be in that position—I understand that position,” Trump said.\n\nPutin bombarded Ukraine with over 100 drones on Christmas Eve and early Christmas Day, killing at least seven civilians.\n\nSunday’s talks were intended to address security guarantees and possible territorial concessions, and while both sides said progress had been made, neither gave any indication that a deal was within reach.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States is offering Ukraine security guarantees for a period of 15 years as part of a proposed peace plan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, though he said he would prefer an American commitment of up to 50 years to deter Russia from further attempts to seize its neighbor’s land by force.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump hosted Zelenskyy at his Florida resort on Sunday and insisted that Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace settlement.\n\nNegotiators are still searching for a breakthrough on key issues, however, including whose forces withdraw from where and the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the 10 biggest in the world. Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.\n\n“Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,” Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.\n\nUkraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDetails of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the “presence” of partners. He didn’t elaborate, but Russia has said it won’t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv’s allies will meet in Paris in early January to “finalize each country’s concrete contributions” to the security guarantees.\n\nTrump said he would consider extending U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.\n\nHowever, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump slathered a fresh coat of makeup on his hand for another round of peace talks with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\nTrump, 79, welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to his Mar-a-Lago estate as he continues to chase down an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which he promised to end on his first day back in office.\n\nThe mismatched concealer on Trump’s hand was once again evident as he took questions from reporters.\n\nJust days ago, on Christmas Eve, the now-familiar bruising on Trump’s right hand was coupled with some discoloration on his left. On Sunday, however, his left hand seemed back to normal, while his right hand remained covered in makeup.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reverted to a statement she has been reusing since February when reached for comment by the Daily Beast.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” she said.\n\nLeavitt previously attributed the persistent bruising to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has closely catalogued the bruising on Trump’s hand, which he has been nursing for months. The makeup smears, together with Trump’s swollen ankles, mysterious MRI, mental flubs, and twice-in-a-year “annual” medical checkups, have raised concerns about the health of the oldest person to be inaugurated president.\n\nThe White House has consistently maintained that Trump is in “excellent health.”\n\nThe president was joined by several of his officials in Mar-a-Lago as he sat down for another meeting with Zelensky, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nA day before the meeting, Russia struck Kyiv with ballistic missiles and drones, killing at least one person and injuring 27 others.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump said he still believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was “very serious” about finding common ground with Ukraine.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, that’s good for everybody. There’s nothing more important,” he told reporters. “I’ve settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one. I thought it would be in the middle of the pack. This is the most difficult one, but we’re gonna get it done.”\n\nThe president stopped short of laying out a timeline for the end of peace talks.\n\n“I don’t have deadlines,” he said. “You know what my deadline is? Getting the war ended.”",
