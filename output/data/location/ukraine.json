    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Monday slapped sanctions on five businessmen linked to Russian state-owned oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft and targeted companies accused of circumventing sanctions on Russian oil by running ships for Moscow's shadow fleet of aging oil tankers.\n\nOil revenue is a key part of Russia’s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the war effort against Ukraine without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.\n\nMember countries, notably France, have vowed to crack down on the sanction-busting shadow fleet which experts estimate numbers over 400 ships. They are also trying to secure deals with flag-carrying countries to make it easier to board the vessels.\n\nEU headquarters said the businessmen “control vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products, originating in Russia or being exported from Russia, concealing the actual origin of the oil, while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe four shipping companies targeted are based in the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Russia. A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",

    "fullText": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and 34 other countries formally approved plans Tuesday to create a compensation body to pay for damages to Ukraine caused by the Russian invasion, but questions remain about where the money will come from.\n\nZelenskyy told leaders gathered in the Dutch city of The Hague that he hopes for strong international support so \"any damage caused by the war can be compensated.”\n\nThe Council of Europe, the continent’s preeminent human rights organization, has facilitated the International Claims Commission, which will allow Ukrainians to seek compensation for “damage, loss or injury” caused by Russia since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022.\n\nThe Council of Europe is adamant that Russia must foot the bill, but there is no clear pathway for forcing Moscow to pay. One proposal is to use some of the tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe.\n\n“The aggressor must pay,” Zelenskyy told the Dutch parliament earlier Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, he attended peace talks in Berlin with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Zelenskyy voiced readiness to drop his country’s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia.\n\n“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he told journalists. “And this is already a compromise on our part.”\n\nThirty-five countries backed the International Claims Commission, but they now must ratify the treaty, a process which usually requires legislature approval. That level of support is unprecedented for the start of a Council of Europe treaty.\n\nThe commission will assess claims made to the already operational register of damages, which was launched during a Council of Europe summit in 2023. Some 80,000 claims have already been filed with the register, which is based in The Hague.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told a press conference the bloc would give one million euros ($1.1 million) to finance the commission's operation. An estimated 3.5 million euros ($4.1 million) are needed overall.\n\nMany of the same countries have also backed a new international court, also under the umbrella of the Council of Europe, to prosecute senior Russian officials for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.\n\nThe officials said talks with President Donald Trump’s envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, led to narrowing differences on security guarantees that Kyiv said must be provided, as well as on Moscow’s demand that Ukraine concede land in the Donbas region in the country’s east.\n\nTrump dialed into a dinner Monday evening with negotiators and European leaders, and more talks are expected this weekend in Miami or elsewhere in the United States, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly by the White House.\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump told reporters at an unrelated White House event. He added, “We’re having tremendous support from European leaders. They want to get it ended, also.\"\n\nThe U.S. officials said the offer of security guarantees won’t be on the table “forever.” They said the Trump administration plans to put forward the agreement on guarantees for Senate approval, although they didn’t specify whether it would be ratified like a treaty, which needs the chamber's two-thirds approval.\n\nIn a statement, European leaders in Berlin said they and the U.S. committed to work together to provide “robust security guarantees,” including a European-led ”multinational force Ukraine\" supported by the U.S.\n\nThey said the force's work would include \"operating inside Ukraine\" as well as assisting in rebuilding Ukraine's forces, securing its skies and supporting safer seas. They said Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.\n\nWitkoff and Kushner were accompanied by U.S. Air Force Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who heads NATO's military operations and the U.S. European Command, as talks honed in on the particulars of what the U.S. officials described as an “Article 5-like” security agreement. Article Five in the NATO treaty is the collective defense clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all.\n\nThe U.S. side presented the Ukrainians a document that spelled out in greater specificity aspects of the proposed U.S. security guarantees — something that Ukrainian officials said was missing from earlier iterations of the U.S. peace proposal, according to U.S. officials.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it a “truly far-reaching, substantial agreement that we did not have before, namely that both Europe and the U.S. are jointly prepared to do this.”\n\nQuestions over Ukraine's postwar security and the fate of occupied territories have been the main obstacles in talks. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil.\n\nZelenskyy on Monday called the talks “substantial” and noted that differences remain on the issue of territory.\n\nZelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine’s preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.\n\nUkraine has continued to reject the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control as a key condition for peace.\n\nThe U.S. officials on Monday said there is consensus on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan, and that Russia has indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the European Union, something it previously said it did not object to.\n\nThe Russian president has cast Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, however, as a major threat to Moscow’s security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nAsked whether the negotiations could be over by Christmas, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said trying to predict a potential time frame for a peace deal was a “thankless task.”\n\n“I can only speak for the Russian side, for President Putin,” Peskov said. “He is open to peace, to a serious peace and serious decisions. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.”\n\nPutin has denied plans to attack any European allies.\n\nRussia fired 153 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said 133 drones were neutralized, while 17 more hit their targets.\n\nIn Russia, the Defense Ministry on Monday said forces destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones overnight. An additional 16 drones were destroyed between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time.\n\nEighteen drones were shot down over Moscow itself, the defense ministry said. Flights were temporarily halted at the city’s Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports as part of safety measures, officials said.\n\nDamage details and casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.

    "description": "Ukraine has claimed to have blown up a Russian submarine using underwater drones for the first time.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine has claimed to have blown up a Russian submarine using underwater drones for the first time.\n\nThe submarine, which was carrying Kalibr cruise missiles and is estimated to cost close to £300m, was critically damaged after being hit in the Russian port city of Novorossiysk, according to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Monday.\n\nThe SBU did not specify the date or time of the attack. If verified, this would be the first time an underwater drone has hit a Russian submarine since the invasion began in 2022.\n\nRussia’s Black Sea Fleet said a Ukrainian attempt to attack the Russian naval base failed, according to news agencies.\n\n“Not &NoBreak;a single ‌ship ‍or submarine of the Black Sea Fleet located at ‍the base in Novorossiysk Bay &NoBreak;was damaged,” agencies quoted the Black Sea Fleet as saying on Monday. “There ‍were no injuries to crew.”\n\nVideo footage purportedly of the attack shows multiple Russian warships and a surfaced submarine, before there’s a sudden explosion in the water.\n\nThe clip has not been independently verified, but Reuters confirmed the location as Novorossiysk using the port’s layout and piers.\n\nThe SBU claimed the 636.6 Varshavyanka-class submarine, which “carried four Kalibr cruise missile launchers”, had been left effectively inoperable.\n\nReplacing it, considering international sanctions imposed on Moscow, would cost up to £370m, the SBU said.\n\n“The Security Service of Ukraine carried out another unique special operation and launched a naval attack in the port of Novorossiysk,” the SBU said in a statement.\n\n“For the first time in history, Sub Sea Baby underwater drones blew up a Russian... submarine.”\n\nUkraine’s upgraded “Sub Sea Baby” drones were unveiled in October, according to the statement.\n\nThe drones reportedly operate at distances of more than 1,500km and carry a payload of up to 2,000kg, around double the previous limit.\n\nAccording to Kyiv, they have previously been used to strike the support columns of the Kerch Bridge, which links Crimea with mainland Russia, and three sanctioned oil tankers linked to Russia’s “shadow fleet” in the Black Sea.\n\nDmytro Pletenchuk, the Ukrainian navy spokesman, told Reuters the operation to hit a submarine marked “another turning point” in the naval battle between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nAlexander Kamyshin, an advisor to ‍President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, ‌wrote on X that it was the first time in history that an underwater drone had neutralised a submarine. “I’ve been waiting for this day,” he said.\n\nThe Kalibr is one of the most modern and accurate cruise missiles in Russia’s arsenal. They are expensive and there are doubts about how many Moscow has left owing to difficulties procuring Western electronics.\n\nThe Varshavyanka submarine is known as the “Black Hole” because of the hull’s ability to absorb sounds and remain invisible to sonars.\n\nRussia is believed to have just 12 Varshavyanka submarines – six in its Black Sea fleet and six in its Pacific fleet, according to Ivan Stupak, Ukrainian military analyst and former SBU officer.\n\nHe added on social media that Novorossiysk is a heavily guarded port. “This is a real game-changer. As a result, one more Kalibr cruise missile carrier is lost and the potential total missile salvo against Ukrainian territory is slightly reduced,” said Mr Stupak.\n\nUkraine has become a world leader in sea drones and is thought to have carried out at least 13 attacks with them.\n\nKyiv has used them to attack Russian military ships and a naval base in Sevastopol, which forced Moscow to relocate its vessels from the Crimean port to the one in Novorossiysk.\n\nUkraine has stepped up its naval attacks in the Black Sea in recent weeks. Russia regularly strikes the Ukrainian port of Odessa.\n\nDrones have become a crucial part in Kyiv’s fight against Russia, as the devices are cheaper and quicker to produce than traditional weaponry.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Russia is now arming its drones with Soviet-era air-to-air missiles to hunt Ukrainian aircraft, Kyiv said.",
    "fullText": "A new kind of Russian drone armed with an air-to-air missile is being made using foreign parts, including some sourced from Western countries, Ukraine's military intelligence agency revealed on Monday.\n\nThe drone — a modified Geran-2 — was recently spotted in Ukraine carrying a Soviet-era missile, a first for this war. From the Ukrainian assessment, it's the latest Russian weapon to turn up with foreign components despite the sweeping international sanctions and export controls targeting Moscow.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence agency, the GUR, said that Russia has armed its Geran-2 drones with R-60 air-to-air missiles to fire at helicopters and aircraft providing air defense for Kyiv. Officials and analysts have delivered similar determinations about the purpose of the modification.\n\n\"The main purpose of the new development is to create a threat to Ukrainian military and tactical aviation, reducing the effectiveness of its work in intercepting enemy UAVs,\" the GUR wrote in a translated statement.\n\nThe GUR said that the modified drone contains foreign-made parts produced by companies in the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland, China, Japan, and Taiwan. Kyiv has frequently identified components in Russian weaponry sourced from these countries, some of which are among Ukraine's closest partners.\n\nRussia's defense ministry and its US embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the foreign parts assessments.\n\nDespite global sanctions, Western technology can still find its way into Russian weaponry via civilian markets, middlemen, or countries that sidestep export rules. Ukraine has repeatedly urged the international community to close those gaps and further isolate the Kremlin.\n\nIn one attack this fall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 100,000 foreign-made parts were discovered among 550 drones and missiles that Russia launched, underscoring just how massive the problem continues to be for Kyiv.\n\nRussia's introduction of a new Geran-2 — a one-way attack drone based on the Iranian Shahed-136 — armed with an air-to-air missile is notable, though it is not the first time in this war that drones have received these types of modifications.\n\nUkraine, for instance, has armed some of its naval drones with surface-to-air missiles, which have been used to shoot down Russian aircraft flying combat air patrols over the Black Sea.\n\nThe Shahed-style Geran-2 usually carries an internal warhead that explodes when the drone impacts a target. The R-60 missile — which entered service for Soviet fighter jets in the early 1970s and has a 6-mile range — may force Russia to limit the size of the payload, potentially reducing the drone's effectiveness in exchange for increased survivability.\n\nThe GUR said that the missile could be used if Russian operators saw a nearby Ukrainian aircraft or helicopters through cameras mounted on the drone and then ordered a launch. The R-60 features heat-seeking technology that enables it to home in on its target.\n\nThe new missile-armed Geran-2 comes as Russia continues to invest heavily in drone operations, including domestic production and the development of new launch sites.",

    "description": "Ukraine has used long-range drones to attack Russian oil platforms as it expands its strikes on the country's energy sector.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine has hit Russian oil platforms in the Caspian Sea with long-range drones three times in a matter of days, a security source told Business Insider on Monday.\n\nIn the most recent attack, drones struck a platform at the Korchagin oil and gas condensate field, causing damage at the facility and forcing it to halt production, said the source in the Security Service of Ukraine, who was only authorized to speak anonymously to discuss sensitive military developments.\n\nThe drone attack is the latest against Russia's energy sector, a critical source of income for Moscow that helps fuel its war efforts in Ukraine. Kyiv has ramped up its deep-strike campaign on key oil and gas facilities and is now targeting infrastructure in the Caspian Sea, hitting activities there for the third time in less than a week.\n\nThe source in the SBU, Ukraine's main internal security agency, said that drones struck the Filanovsky oil production platform last Thursday, marking the first time Kyiv had caused damage to Russian oil infrastructure in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe following day, Ukrainian drones struck the Filanovsky platform again and also hit the Korchagin platform. The SBU source said that the attacks caused damage at both facilities and forced a suspension of operations.\n\nThe platforms are owned by Lukoil-Nizhnevolzhskneft, a subsidiary of the Russian energy giant Lukoil. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the drone attacks. Additionally, neither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe SBU source said that the agency is working to deny Russia the critical revenue from its energy sector, which helps finance the war in Ukraine. They said that the Filanovsky deposit is one of Russia's largest, with an estimated 129 million tons of oil.\n\n\"No Russian object working for the war is safe regardless of its location,\" the source said, according to a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\nThe repeated targeting of the two Caspian Sea oil platforms appears to signal a new shift for Ukraine as it continues to strike Russian oil and gas infrastructure.\n\nFor months, Ukraine has mostly carried out attacks against oil refineries, ports, and other facilities across Russia. However, in recent weeks, Kyiv has expanded these operations beyond land and intensified its strikes on maritime targets.\n\nJust before the three strikes in the Caspian Sea, Ukraine used its naval drones packed with explosives to attack three tankers allegedly belonging to the Russian \"shadow fleet,\" a collection of hundreds of vessels that Moscow uses to move oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the campaign against the Russian energy sector as \"long-range\" sanctions. The deep-strike campaign has been a bright spot for Kyiv in this war as Moscow's forces continue to make slow but costly gains on the battlefield.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has repeatedly urged its international partners to do more to prevent Russia from exporting oil and earning cash to fuel its invasion.",

    "description": "Ukraine's internal security agency said the attack damaged and disabled a Russian Kilo-class submarine in the port city of Novorossiysk.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine carried out a first-of-its-kind attack on a Russian submarine using underwater drones, Kyiv said on Monday, revealing a new use for its explosive-packed uncrewed systems.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, said it executed a \"unique special operation\" using an underwater drone to strike a Russian Kilo-class submarine at the Black Sea port Novorossiysk, damaging and disabling the boat.\n\nThe SBU, Ukraine's main internal security agency, disclosed that the attack involved the employment of its \"Sub Sea Baby\" drones, which appear to be an underwater version of the Sea Baby naval drone Ukraine uses to target Russian surface vessels and port infrastructure.\n\nThe SBU said in a statement that the submarine was equipped with four launchers for Kalibr cruise missiles, which Russia regularly fires at Ukrainian cities.\n\nThe security agency did not specify when the operation took place, but it said it was carried out in coordination with the Ukrainian navy. The SBU published footage that appears to show the moment the underwater drone impacted the submarine, causing a large explosion.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe Kilo-class submarines are diesel-electric boats that have been in service since the 1980s. Russia has dozens of active subs, which make up one of the largest submarine fleets in the world.\n\nThe SBU said a Kilo-class submarine costs around $400 million, but the agency added that sweeping international sanctions would make it notably more costly for Russia to build a replacement.\n\nThe submarine attack marks the latest against Russia's naval force in the Black Sea. Since the start of the war, Ukraine has employed drones and missiles to damage and destroy dozens of warships and other vessels.\n\nThe asymmetrical campaign has forced Russia to relocate the bulk of its battered Black Sea Fleet from the long-held headquarters on the occupied Crimean peninsula across the region to Novorossiysk. However, Ukraine has demonstrated it can target Russian ships there as well.\n\nThe SBU said on Monday that the damaged submarine was in Novorossiysk due to the Ukrainian operations that drove the Russian Navy away from Crimea earlier in the war.\n\nMore significantly, the submarine attack appears to signal a new chapter in drone warfare. Ukraine has used naval drones, such as the Sea Baby, to strike Russian surface ships and used underwater drones to target Russia's \"shadow fleet\" vessels moving oil and circumventing sanctions.\n\nHowever, a strike on a submarine with what has been likened to a slow-moving mine or torpedo suggests an expansion of Ukrainian capabilities.\n\nBeyond Ukraine, Russia and NATO countries have actively developed their own underwater drone technology as militaries look to augment traditional naval capabilities with more uncrewed systems.",

    "fullText": "Move marks big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as safeguard against Russian attacks\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy has offered to drop Ukraine’s aspirations to join the Nato military alliance, as he held five hours of talks with US envoys in Berlin on Sunday to end the war with Russia.\n\nDonald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said “a lot of progress was made” as he and the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met Zelenskyy in the latest push to end Europe’s bloodiest conflict since the second world war – though full details were not divulged.\n\nDmytro Lytvyn, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said Zelenskyy would comment further when the talks conclude on Monday. He added that officials are now considering the draft documents.\n\nBefore the talks, Zelenskyy had offered to drop Ukraine’s goal to join Nato in exchange for western security guarantees.\n\nThe move marks a big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia’s war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow.\n\n“Representatives held in-depth discussions regarding the 20-point plan for peace, economic agendas, and more. A lot of progress was made,” Witkoff wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe talks were hosted by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who a source said had made brief remarks before leaving the two sides to negotiate. Other European leaders are also due in Germany for talks on Monday.\n\nZelenskyy described the concession on Nato as a compromise.\n\n“From the very beginning, Ukraine’s desire was to join Nato: these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,” he said – adding that legally binding security guarantees from the US, Europe and other countries such as Canada and Japan could “prevent another Russian invasion”.\n\nVladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its Nato ambitions and withdraw troops from approximately 10% of Donbas that Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country, and that no Nato troops can be stationed there.\n\nRussian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a “written” pledge by leading western powers not to enlarge the US-led Nato alliance eastwards – shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics.\n\nZelenskyy had earlier called for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again.\n\nUnder pressure from Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow’s demands, Zelenskyy accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities, as well as Ukraine’s power and water supplies.\n\nSending Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress nearly four years after Russia’s 2022 invasion.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine, Europe and the US are looking at a 20-point plan, and that at the end of this there is a ceasefire. He said Kyiv has had no direct talks with Moscow.\n\nA ceasefire along the current frontlines would be a fair option, he added.\n\nBritain, France and Germany have been working to refine the US proposals, which in a draft disclosed last month called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its Nato ambitions and accept limits on its armed forces.\n\nEuropean allies have described this as a “critical moment” that could shape Ukraine’s future, and sought to shore up Kyiv’s finances by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget.",

    "fullText": "A 1,000-strong \"dark fleet\" of rogue oil tankers skirting sanctions has emerged as a new target for the U.S. and Ukraine, a senior maritime intelligence analyst claims.\n\nMichelle Wiese Bockmann warned the aging fleet poses geopolitical risks and threats of $1 billion oil spills, with the recent U.S. seizures in Venezuela and Ukrainian drone strikes in the Black Sea marking a turning point for both nations in their efforts.\n\n\"There are about 1,000 vessels worldwide that are trading sanctioned crude tankers containing sanctioned Iranian, Venezuelan and Russian oil,\" Bockmann told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"These vessels are a lifeline for these regimes, because they’re used for shipping oil to fund the war in Ukraine, and also give money to the illicit Maduro regime,\" she added.\n\nIran Backs Maduro To Keep Latin America Foothold As Trump Increases Pressure On Venezuela\n\n\"This is a brand-new problem for the U.S., and now Ukraine has signaled they are going to target these vessels the same way,\" she said. \"There is a new strategy to deal with this dark fleet, which is the lifeline of sanctioned oil revenues, and now under attack by the U.S. and Ukraine. The strategy is all to counter what we call gray-zone aggression.\"\n\nUs Escalation With Maduro Halts Deportation Flights To Venezuela\n\nRecent Ukrainian naval drone strikes have disabled several tankers in the Black Sea, including the Dashan, part of Russia’s so-called shadow fleet that Ukraine says helps Moscow export oil in defiance of sanctions, according to Reuters.\n\n\"It is dangerous and could be interpreted as a form of gray-zone aggression in order to continue to keep oil revenue flowing,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"This is all a billion-dollar oil spill catastrophe waiting to happen,\" she added, pointing to the environmental and navigational risks posed by poorly maintained, uninsured ships.\n\nVenezuela Mobilizes Troops, Weapons In Response To Us Warship Buildup In Caribbean\n\nShe said a subset of \"about 350 to 400 vessels at any one time are not only sanctioned but falsely flying flags, which is dangerous,\" because false registration leaves vessels stateless and uninsured, putting crews at risk.\n\n\"This is a huge issue for maritime safety, it’s a menace to the environment, and it entails crew welfare,\" Bockmann said.\n\nThese vessels, she said, are typically \"elderly\" and used solely for sanctioned oil trades. Many also \"manipulate AIS\" to show they are in one place when they are actually elsewhere.\n\nTrump Sends World's Most Powerful Warship To Latin America — Historic Echoes Of Regime Change\n\n\"They use false flagging, but also spoofing and manipulating its AIS to show it's in one place when it's not. These vessels have also gone to fraudulent registries that don't exist, which means they have no insurance,\" she said. \"Their certificates of seaworthiness are invalid, and they have relied on international maritime conventions to have what's called the ‘right of innocent passage’ so they can't get intercepted.\"\n\nBockmann said U.S. forces have used legal tools including Article 110 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which allows boarding of stateless vessels, to stop these ships.\n\n\"It's my belief that they used Article 110, and they got on board that vessel, and they were absolutely entitled to remove that vessel from global trade,\" she said.\n\nVenezuela Accuses Us Of 'Piracy' After Seizing Massive Oil Tanker\n\nIn the Caribbean, U.S. forces recently seized the tanker Skipper, sanctioned in 2022 and found to be masking its location, under a federal warrant as part of a broader campaign to disrupt illicit oil shipping.\n\n\"The recent Venezuelan tanker was carrying 1.8 million barrels of oil uninsured, so that's a billion-dollar maritime disaster waiting to happen,\" Bockmann said.\n\nAs reported by Fox News Digital, Dec. 12 saw Attorney General Pam Bondi frame the U.S. seizure of a Venezuelan crude tanker as a sanctions-enforcement action rooted in a federal court warrant.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Black Sea, Ukraine targeted multiple alleged \"shadow fleet\" tankers with sea drones, according to Reuters.\n\n\"The three tankers that have been targeted by Ukraine are all in ballast, which means that they weren't carrying oil,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"That was carefully chosen, and they were also falsely flagged, just like in the recent case of the three tankers attacked in Ukraine. That flag was Gambia. In the U.S. case of Skipper, the flag was Guyana,\" Bockmann said.\n\nFox News Digital's Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "Ukraine's drone schools are preparing soldiers to take on Russia and working to keep pace with an ever-changing fight.",
    "fullText": "The Ukrainian drone schools training operators for war are having to rewrite their lessons as fast as every other week to get students ready for an ever-changing battlefield.\n\nWithin the drone battle, a critically important aspect of this war, tech and tactics are shifting rapidly. Three drone schools told Business Insider that it's imperative they keep their lessons up to date because it's life or death on the battlefield.\n\nTo maintain relevance and the tactical edge, the instructors are visiting the front regularly, keeping in touch with former students, and testing out new technology to shape their curriculum.\n\nTetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, told Business Insider that changes sometimes take place every two weeks.\n\nAt the front, the evolution of technology is \"moving forward at a very fast pace.\" It means that \"also we have to be very fast in our adaptability.\"\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, told BI that \"we continuously make changes to our training programs.\"\n\nFor the most part, he said, no two lectures on the same subject are exactly the same; something is always changing. Over 16,000 students have trained at the school. Their comments and experiences are reflected in the training program curriculum, Slediuk said. Instructors also visit the front lines, and service members come to the school, where they deliver insight into the latest in warfighting.\n\nThere are also group chats with soldiers, Tetyana said. It's two-way communication, with soldiers sharing front-line feedback and instructors providing guidance and advice.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that it is absolutely vital that schools teach what is informed by and needed for the field.\n\n\"We do not teach things that will not be necessary in combat,\" he said. \"We constantly update our instructors' knowledge,\" occasionally with visits to the front to \"see firsthand what has changed, what remains relevant, and what can be discarded.\"\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, told Business Insider that all students are in group chats with their instructors, and that connection is preserved after the training is complete. \"Cadets go to the front line, type questions in those chats, or provide information about new enemy tactics.\"\n\nNew information is added to the courses, with some topics updated every three months, he said.\n\nDrone strikes are responsible for most front-line hits and casualties, with both sides using them in lieu of traditional weaponry.\n\nThe result is constant modifications to how they are used and their tactics, as well as the drones themselves, with new types frequently entering the battlefield.\n\nLuke Pollard, the UK's armed forces minister, said this year that Western militaries risk becoming outdated. He said drone warfare is evolving so fast that \"we have to fundamentally challenge our assumptions.\"\n\nHe said that drone technology in Ukraine \"iterates every two to three weeks on the front line,\" while NATO militaries \"build and procure really expensive high-end bits of kit. And it will take you five, 10 years: five years to run a procurement challenge, another 10 years to build it.\" At that rate, the system may already be obsolete by the time it's ready for war.\n\nDefense companies watching Ukraine can see the speed of change, too, and are moving quickly to make changes. Matt McCrann, CEO of the US arm of Droneshield, a company making counter-drone systems for the US and Europe, recently told Business Insider that weapon development cycles are shifting from months and years to weeks.\n\nCompanies are regularly engaging in approaches similar to the drone schools — chats with soldiers and even front-line visits — to keep their understanding of warfighting demands up to date. Some companies have previously told BI that the ways Ukrainians are using tech have come as a surprise, so that communication and engagement are critical.\n\nGediminas Guoba, the CEO of Lithuanian company Granta Autonomy, which has drones in Ukraine, told Business Insider over the summer that he visits the battlefield himself \"just to understand how it really works\" and see what changes need to be made to its products to keep them relevant.\n\nAnd it's beneficial for soldiers too, sparking faster iteration. Ukrainian drone operators have told Business Insider that they keep in touch with companies making their drones to give them feedback on how they can be improved, as well as to get things like replacement parts.\n\nFrom the companies making drones to the troops using them to the schools training operators, everyone is rushing to maintain the edge, but the schools are not simply fighting to stay on top of changes. Targeted by Russian attacks and often seeking donations to help fund the training, they're fighting for survival as well.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Friday indefinitely froze Russia’s assets in Europe to ensure that Hungary and Slovakia, both with Moscow-friendly governments, can’t prevent the billions of euros from being used to support Ukraine.\n\nUsing a special procedure meant for economic emergencies, the EU blocked the assets until Russia gives up its war on Ukraine and compensates its neighbor for the heavy damage that it has inflicted for almost four years.\n\nEU Council President António Costa said European leaders had committed in October “to keep Russian assets immobilized until Russia ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates for the damage caused. Today we delivered on that commitment.”\n\nIt’s a key step that will allow EU leaders to work out at a summit next week how to use the tens of billions of euros in Russian Central Bank assets to underwrite a huge loan to help Ukraine meet its financial and military needs over the next two years.\n\n“Next step: securing Ukraine’s financial needs for 2026–27,” added Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit.\n\nThe move also prevents the assets, estimated to total around 210 billion euros ($247 billion), from being used in any negotiations to end the war without European approval.\n\nA 28-point plan drafted by U.S. and Russian envoys stipulated that the EU would release the frozen assets for use by Ukraine, Russia and the United States. That plan, which surfaced last month, was rejected by Ukraine and its backers in Europe.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X that the EU decision means that “no one will decide in place of the Europeans the use of these funds.”\n\nThe vast majority of the funds — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in Euroclear, a Belgian financial clearing house.\n\nThe money was frozen under sanctions that the EU imposed on Russia over the war it launched on Feb. 24, 2022, but these sanctions must be renewed every six months with the approval of all 27 member countries.\n\nHungary and Slovakia oppose providing more support to Ukraine, but Friday’s decision prevents them from blocking the sanctions rollover and make it easier to use the assets.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe – said on social media that it means that “the rule of law in the European Union comes to an end, and Europe’s leaders are placing themselves above the rules.”\n\n“The European Commission is systematically raping European law. It is doing this in order to continue the war in Ukraine, a war that clearly isn’t winnable,” he wrote. He said that Hungary “will do everything in its power to restore a lawful order.”\n\nIn a letter to Costa, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said that he would refuse to back any move that “would include covering Ukraine’s military expenses for the coming years.”\n\nHe warned “that the use of frozen Russian assets could directly jeopardize U.S. peace efforts, which directly count on the use of these resources for the reconstruction of Ukraine.”\n\nBut the commission argues that the war has imposed heavy costs by hiking energy prices and stunting economic growth in the EU, which has already provided nearly 200 billion euros ($235 billion) in support to Ukraine.\n\nBelgium, where Euroclear is based, is opposed to the “reparations loan” plan. It says that the plan “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks,” and has called on other EU countries to share the risk.\n\nRussia’s Central Bank, meanwhile, said on Friday that it has filed a lawsuit in Moscow against Euroclear for damages it says were caused when Moscow was barred from managing the assets. Euroclear declined to comment.\n\nThe Belgian clearing house has around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) in Russia and it’s unclear what would happen to that money if the legal challenge or others like it succeed.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Central Bank also described wider EU plans to use Russian assets to aid Ukraine as “illegal, contrary to international law,” arguing that they violated “the principles of sovereign immunity of assets.”\n\nBut EU Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis brushed off the suit, saying that the decision is “legally robust,” and that he expects Russia “to continue to launch speculative legal proceedings to prevent the EU from upholding international law.”\n\nChris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. Consultancy, said that the timing of the court action is “clearly linked” to the EU’s intention to use the frozen assets.\n\n“The Russian Central Bank is making clear that it will respond with legal actions against all countries involved in the decision to take the Russian money,” he said.\n\nFriday's EU decision came hours after Germany summoned the Russian ambassador in Berlin following allegations of sabotage, disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks and interference in its elections.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A senior Kremlin official said Friday that Russian police and National Guard will stay on in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas and oversee the industry-rich region, even if a peace settlement ends Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\n\nThe remarks by Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov underscore Moscow's ambition to maintain its presence in Donbas post-war. Ukraine is likely to reject such a stance as U.S.-led negotiations drag on.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian units have recaptured several settlements and neighborhoods near the city of Kupiansk in the northeastern Kharkiv region, following a monthslong operation aimed at reversing Russian advances there.\n\nKupiansk has in recent months been one of the most closely contested sectors of the around 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, and the claimed Ukrainian progress of around 40 sq. km. (15 sq. miles) would be a setback for Russia.\n\nLess than two months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Ukrainian troops in Kupiansk were surrounded and offered to negotiate their surrender. He said a media visit to the area would prove it. Putin has sought to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of strength in the war.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s office said he would host Zelenskyy on Monday for talks as peace efforts gain momentum and European leaders seek to steer negotiations. Afterward, numerous European heads of state and government, as well as the leaders of the European Union and NATO, will join the meeting, a statement said.\n\nMoscow will give its blessing to a ceasefire only after Ukraine’s forces have withdrawn from the front line, Ushakov also said in comments published Friday in Russian business daily Kommersant.\n\nHe told Kommersant “it’s entirely possible that there won’t be any troops (in the Donbas), either Russian or Ukrainian” in a postwar scenario. But he said that “there will be the National Guard, our police, everything necessary to maintain order and organize life.”\n\nFor months, American negotiators have tried to navigate the demands of each side as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for a swift end to Russia’s war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into a major obstacle over who keeps Ukrainian territory that Russian forces have occupied so far.\n\nSince Moscow’s 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea and the seizure of territory in the east by Russia-backed separatists later that year, as well as land taken after the full-blown invasion was launched on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia has captured about 20% of its neighbor.\n\nUkraine says its constitution doesn’t allow it to surrender land. Russia, which illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions illegally in 2022, says the same. Ushakov said that “no matter what the outcome (of peace talks), this territory (the Donbas) is Russian Federation territory.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump compared the negotiations to a very complex real estate deal. He said that he wants to see more progress in talks before sending envoys to possible meetings with European leaders over the weekend.\n\nIn October, Trump said the Donbas region will have to be \"cut up\" to end the war.\n\nIn recent months, Russia’s army has made a determined push to gain control of all parts of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, which together make up the valuable Donbas region.\n\nIts slow slog across the Ukrainian countryside, using its significant advantage in troop numbers in a corrosive war of attrition, has been costly in terms of casualties and losses of armor. Although outnumbered, Ukrainian defenders have held firm in many areas and counterattacked in others.\n\nUkrainian forces said Friday that they had advanced around Kupiansk. They gradually cut off Russian supply routes into the city, starting on Sept. 22, and regained control of the villages of Kindrashivka and Radkivka, as well as several northern districts of the city, according to a statement by Ukrainian National Guard’s Khartia Corps posted on Facebook.\n\nFighting is ongoing in central Kupiansk, where more than 200 Russian soldiers are encircled, the statement said.\n\nZelenskyy posted a video of himself standing on the road into Kupiansk on Friday. Explosions could be heard in the background as he spoke.\n\n“Today, it is critically important to achieve results on the battlefield so that Ukraine can achieve results in diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said in the video, praising his troops on Ukraine’s Ground Forces Day.\n\nRussian officials made no immediate comment, and the Ukrainians statements couldn't be independently verified.\n\nUkraine also has developed its long-range strike capabilities using domestically produced weapons to disrupt Russia's war machine.\n\nIts Special Operations Forces, or SSO, said Friday that an operation in the Caspian Sea struck two Russian vessels carrying military equipment and arms.\n\nThe ships named Kompozitor Rakhmaninov and Askar-Saridzha are under U.S. sanctions for transporting arms between Russia and Iran, the SSO said in a statement on social media. It didn't say what weapons it used in its attack.\n\nA Ukrainian drone attack wounded seven people, including a child, in the Russian city of Tver, acting Gov. Vitaly Korolev said Friday. Falling drone debris struck an apartment building in the city, which lies northwest of Moscow, Korolev said.\n\nRussia’s air defenses destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia’s Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian drones struck a residential area of Pavlohrad, in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding four others, the head of the local military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko, wrote on the Telegram messaging channel on Friday.\n\nUkraine’s southern Odesa region came under a large-scale drone attack overnight, according to regional chief Oleh Kiper. The attack damaged energy infrastructure, he said. More than 90,000 people were without electricity on Friday morning, Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said.\n\nUkraine’s air force said that Russia launched 80 drones across the country during the night.\n\nLitvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.

    "description": "Ukrainian special operators described to Business Insider how they came under Russian fire driving buggies near the front lines.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's elite special operators rely on light buggies to swiftly move along the front lines, banking on their speed and maneuverability to execute high-stakes missions.\n\nThese run-and-gun vehicles don't come with much in the way of external protection, leaving them exposed and vulnerable to Russian drone strikes, but that's the tradeoff for flexibility in combat.\n\nTwo soldiers in Ukraine's 4th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit modeled after its US Army counterparts, talked to Business Insider about how they found themselves under Russian drone fire near the front lines while riding in the buggies.\n\nBoth attacks, which were carried out in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region in recent months, left soldiers injured, the two special operators said. They could only be identified by their call signs for security reasons.\n\nIn September, Khyzhak and two other operators were driving back to base from a mission when a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone appeared behind their buggy and started chasing the vehicle.\n\nKhyzhak said that his driver skillfully maneuvered away from the Russian drone at the last second, which detonated a few feet away on the side of the road. The Ukrainians, having narrowly survived, jumped out of the buggy. One of the operators landed awkwardly and broke his leg.\n\nThe 4th @SOF_UKR Regiment Rangers skillfully maneuver away from an enemy FPV while returning from the frontline to the base. Video from the ranger's action camera of the 2nd Battalion, the Northern-Slobozhanskyi direction. Ukrainian SOF: Always Beyond! pic.twitter.com/i7tN5PQsSZ\n\nTwo months earlier, in July, Drago and several other operators were out in a buggy when they were attacked by a massive swarm of Russian FPV drones — so many, in fact, that he described how their tiny propellers made the whole sky sound \"noisy.\"\n\nDrago said his buggy was struck and shrapnel from the explosion injured his left hand and pelvis. Then, another Ukrainian buggy that went to help came under drone fire. Multiple operators from the 4th Ranger Regiment found themselves caught in the large attack.\n\nKhyzhak speculated that the Russian drone pilots may be intentionally targeting the Ukrainian buggies because these vehicles are known to carry elite troops, forces that tend to stir up trouble behind enemy lines.\n\nIn his case, the Russian drone didn't react to any other vehicles in the vicinity, he said. However, Drago said that when he was struck, the concentration of Russian drones was so high that pilots attacked anything they could, including ATVs and armored personnel carriers.\n\nAlthough several buggies were caught in the attack, Drago said that it's hard to say whether they were priority targets.\n\nIt's unclear to what extent the targeting of buggies may reflect a broader trend. The Russian defense ministry and its embassy in the US did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe buggy is a four-wheel car with virtually no external protection. It is one of the lightweight vehicles used in the conflict for infantry assaults, rapid movement, and other specialized missions, alongside quad bikes, motorcycles, and even electric scooters.\n\nThese buggies can also run logistics missions — hauling ammunition to the front or evacuating wounded troops. Ukraine's defense industry has signaled it intends to mass-produce them.\n\nThe US Army is notably interested in something very similar, the Infantry Squad Vehicle, a lightweight buggy-style combat asset that comes as the service and soldiers look to prioritize speed and flexibility over cumbersome heavy armor.\n\nUnlike armored vehicles, which have hardened exteriors, the buggies used in Ukraine look more like militarized golf carts. However, their main advantages are speed, maneuverability, and off-road capabilities that allow access to areas other vehicles can't reach and a shot at dodging drones, though these can be tough to evade.\n\nThese characteristics are particularly useful for special operators, who try to keep a low profile during their missions.\n\nKhyzhak, who joined Ukraine's special operators forces nearly two years ago and commands a small unit, said that he faced the threat of Russian drones earlier in the war while riding in US-made High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (Humvees) or Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles.\n\nThe September near-miss, though, was the first time he experienced a Russian drone attack while riding in a buggy.\n\nUkrainian officials have said that attack drones are destroying most battlefield targets now, making large mechanized assaults with armored vehicles far harder for both sides.\n\nThe increasing threat of drones has pushed Ukraine and Russia to acquire and field smaller, lighter, and faster vehicles as alternatives to more traditional — often slower, less flexible, and more easily spotted — systems, such as tanks and heavy armor.\n\nAt least 14,000 tanks and armored vehicles have been destroyed in this conflict, according to the open-source intelligence platform Oryx, which tracks equipment losses on both sides. Many systems have been taken out by drones.\n\nThe expanded use of light vehicles for combat and logistics missions underscores how Ukraine and Russia are adapting to the threat of drones, which dominate the battlefield all along the front line.",

Household behavior has become more frugal,\" according to the central bank report.\n\nRetailers in many regions report weakening demand for big-ticket and nonessential goods, marking a clear cooling after the post-2022 consumer boom.\n\n\"More subdued consumption may indicate a gradual reduction in labor market overheating and more moderate expectations for future income dynamics,\" wrote Russia's central bank.\n\nIt's a notable shift for an economy that witnessed a boom in consumer spending after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, even amid sweeping sanctions against Moscow.\n\nThat boom was fueled by surging defense spending and intense competition for scarce workers. Wages jumped, and many households went on spending sprees.\n\nNow, that momentum appears to be fading.\n\nWage growth has slowed, and firms across multiple regions report reduced manpower demand and less urgency to hire, reflecting a cooling labor market, according to the central bank report.\n\nMany firms told the central bank they expect even more modest wage increases in 2026, suggesting that households may be bracing for leaner times.\n\nThe central bank's latest report arrives as Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year, and the limits of wartime economic stimulus become more apparent.\n\nOil and gas revenues — the backbone of Russia's budget — dropped 34% year-over-year in November.\n\nEven before this, analysts had warned that Russia's economy was being sustained largely by defense spending, subsidies, and emergency policy interventions.\n\nTop officials had sounded alarms. In December 2023, Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's central bank governor, warned that the economy was at risk of overheating.\n\nLast June, the head of Russia's largest bank said the economy was \"definitely and strongly overheated.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a deepening demographic crisis and ongoing competition for labor between the military and industry continue to weigh on Russia's growth prospects, both now and in the years ahead.",

    "description": "Drone schools in Ukraine say they've realized what traits tend to make people the best pilots for the fight against Russia.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's drone schools say it's clear: young, tech-savvy people with a gaming background make the best drone pilots.\n\nAcross the country, drone schools are training new operators for what has become one of the most important roles in Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion — flying the drones that scout Russian positions, find targets, and blow up tanks and troops.\n\nThree leaders working at two schools told Business Insider that younger students with gaming or tech experience tend to consistently pick up skills the fastest. These students often are already comfortable with controllers, joysticks, and staring at a screen for a long time.\n\nThe instructor comments offer insight into what kind of person makes the best pilot, useful as Ukraine continues to fight for its survival and Western militaries study the war, investing more heavily in drone programs for a potential future fight.\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, said younger people and gamers, \"are really good because their system of motor movements in their hands is already well developed.\"\n\nHis colleague, Tetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, agreed, telling BI that \"those who used to play video games, those who are accustomed to using a joystick, would be better in terms of running an FPV drone.\"\n\nTechnical fluency matters too. It's easier to train people with IT or engineering backgrounds than it is teachers, marketing specialists, or accountants. This war is one of rapidly evolving technology and tactics, especially in drone warfare.\n\nBeing an operator isn't just about physical control; it's about really understanding how drones work and what they can do. The school strives to instill these principles in all students.\n\nAnd gaming experience, technical knowledge, and flexible adaptation in the face of new technology tend to be more easily found among younger students. If they're over 50, Tetyana explained, \"it is a bit more challenging for students to get hold of controlling some types of drones.\"\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said someone who flies well isn't automatically a strong combat operator — but after a year of training, his team has identified what works.\n\n\"Young people aged 18-27 are the easiest to train,\" he said. \"They memorize information and acquire skills faster and more effectively. As we have noted, the older a person is, the more difficult it is for them to learn.\"\n\nSimilar to the other drone school leaders, Pervak said people who have a technical mindset can absorb training \"more easily and understand the intricacies of using UAVs in combat better.\" Those who were programmers and gamers often \"find it easiest to focus on a monitor for long periods of time. Everyone else must develop this skill.\"\n\nGood health is also key, but he said the school has nonetheless \"successfully trained people with visual and hearing impairments, back problems, contusions, and even head injuries.\"\n\nDrones account for about 60% of Ukraine's front-line strikes, according to the country's commander-in-chief. With shortages of artillery shells and other weaponry, Ukraine has leaned heavily on drones. The inexpensive systems have been highly effective at damaging and destroying equipment worth millions.\n\nCheap drones offer an asymmetric advantage and provide the Ukrainian military with combat power it couldn't generate with humans and crewed assets alone. But its drone force is only as strong as its pilots are capable, making drone training essential.\n\nThe drone school leaders are not alone in their assessment of who tends to make the best pilots.\n\nUkrainian soldiers with gaming backgrounds have also credited that experience for their skills, and Ukraine's special drone unit, Typhoon, previously told Business Insider that gamers make great drone pilots. But they also cautioned that real drone warfare is much more complicated and dangerous than any video game.\n\nOne Typhoon operator said that \"people think flying a military drone is like playing 'Call of Duty,' until they realize there's no restart option,\" referring to the popular video game.\n\nWestern drone pilots have previously expressed similar sentiments. Tanner Yackley, a former US Air Force drone operator who left in 2018, previously told Business Insider that it's fundamentally different because \"you're making life or death calls every single day.\"\n\n\"There's not a single game in the world that can prep you for what you're going to do,\" he said.\n\nAs NATO watches the war in Ukraine, worried about a wider conflict, its forces are already adapting and also looking to gamers, even embracing tech from the gaming world to make it easier for younger troops to quickly skill up on new technology.\n\nSome American and European troops, for instance, are training on a new air-defense system that uses an Xbox controller to launch interceptor drones.\n\nThe drone schools, however, are constantly grappling with challenges, such as limited funding, reliance on donated drones, and the threat of Russian strikes. They have to keep their curricula updated, with instructors traveling to the front and rewriting lessons every couple of weeks to match the rapid battlefield shifts.",

    "title": "Interceptor drones are taking over in Ukraine, but soldiers are still using machine guns to battle Russian threats",
    "description": "The drones are still in limited supply and are not always the ideal interception method, Ukrainian soldiers and an official told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces are still using decades-old machine guns and small arms to defend against Russian air attacks, even as cheap interceptor drones surge in popularity.\n\nInterceptor drones, which are armed with small warheads and fly directly into their targets or explode nearby to destroy them midair, have become a crucial tool for Ukraine as it struggles to defend against worsening Russian bombardments.\n\nHowever, Ukraine still doesn't have enough of these drones, and they aren't always the best tool for every intercept, making guns a practical fallback, Ukrainian soldiers and an official familiar with the security situation told Business Insider.\n\nOleksiy, the deputy commander of a Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces mobile air defense unit who could only be identified by his first name for security reasons, said his troops are training to use new interceptor drones to strengthen their arsenal.\n\nOleksiy's unit, tasked with protecting Irpin, a city on the outskirts of Ukraine's capital Kyiv, has historically used the .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun mounted on the bed of a pickup truck to battle the Russian one-way attack drones that are regularly launched at Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this year, though, Russia started modifying its drones to fly faster and at higher altitudes, beyond the range of the Browning, a popular US-made heavy weapon designed around the end of World War I.\n\nOleksiy said his unit is still using the Browning, but it hasn't scored any hits recently because the Russian drones are beyond its capabilities. He said that other Ukrainian air defenders also rely on the machine gun, which has decades of combat experience.\n\nOleksiy argued that guns will likely continue to have a role in air defense. Ultimately, soldiers will decide which weapon best suits their needs in the moment.\n\n\"Defense forces always use all available means of deterrence, and a machine gun is currently one of the cheapest means if there are enemy air targets in its range,\" he said.\n\nA special operator in Ukraine's 4th Ranger Regiment, who previously worked with the Browning in an air defense sub-unit, said the gun is a reliable weapon troops can master in just a few days.\n\nRussian drones don't always maintain a consistent altitude in flight; sometimes they fly closer to the ground, where they become vulnerable to the Browning, said Drago, who could only be identified by his call sign for security reasons.\n\nOfficials, however, would like to see a shift toward the newer capabilities. Yehor Cherniev, the deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, told Business Insider that air defenders still largely use \"outdated weapons,\" including guns, to battle Russian drones.\n\nCherniev said Ukraine is replacing these weapons with interceptor drones at a rapid pace, describing them as \"far more effective.\"\n\nHe said that \"due to a lack of funding and limited assistance from our partners, we have not yet been able to implement the use of interceptor drones everywhere and on the necessary scale.\" Limits on these capabilities leave crews dependent on older options that are useful but not always well-suited for the threat.\n\nInterceptor drones emerged earlier this year as a top defense priority for Ukraine because these systems are inexpensive and can be manufactured in large quantities. They are among the latest battlefield innovations and crucial technology as Kyiv faces growing Russian investment in its long-range drone operations and ever-expanding nightly attacks.\n\nSome Ukrainian interceptor drones are worth as little as $2,500; by comparison, Russia's one-way attack drones are estimated to cost $35,000 on the low end. Officials stress that it's crucial to be on the right end of the cost curve.\n\nUkraine's defense industry is now producing hundreds of interceptor drones daily, and the military frequently shares footage showing them downing Russian attack and reconnaissance drones.\n\nWestern military officials and Ukrainian organizations have said that interceptor drones are responsible for taking down thousands of Russian drones in combat.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO is taking note of the success of interceptor drones in Ukraine. Some allies have purchased and are deploying their own systems, recognizing the value as a low-cost air defense solution that doesn't necessarily require extensive training.\n\nOleksiy's unit began training on the new interceptor drones earlier in the fall, and they expect to wrap up soon. While he acknowledged that there is a bit of a learning curve, he said that it \"doesn't scare us.\"",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used naval drones packed with explosives to attack an oil tanker identified as part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Black Sea on Wednesday, a security source told Business Insider.\n\nThe naval drone strike on the tanker, Dashan, marks the third such attack in less than two weeks as Ukraine ramps up its long-range strike campaign against Russia's energy sector, increasingly gunning for ships at sea in addition to land-based oil facilities.\n\nSea Baby naval drones hit the tanker and caused \"critical damage\" to the vessel, with early indications indicating that the strike completely disabled the vessel, the source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the country's main internal security agency, revealed on Wednesday.\n\nThe SBU source, only authorized to speak anonymously to discuss sensitive military developments, said the Dashan was flying the Comoros flag and moving through Ukraine's exclusive economic zone in the direction of Novorossiysk, a Russian port city and major oil terminal.\n\nPublicly available ship-tracking data last showed the Dashan in the middle of the Black Sea.\n\nThe tanker was sailing at maximum speed with its transponder turned off, the security source said. They added that the attack was carried out in cooperation with the Ukrainian navy and shared footage captured by the Sea Baby drones showing multiple hits on the ship.\n\nSeveral Western countries and the European Union have sanctioned the $30 million tanker, which has been used for Russian oil exports and is known to sail with its transponder switched off, Ukraine's HUR military intelligence agency said.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the extent of the damage. Russia's defense ministry and its embassy in the US did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe attack on Wednesday appears to mark the third time in the last two weeks that Ukraine has disabled a tanker belonging to the \"shadow fleet.\" In late November, the SBU used naval drones to strike and damage two vessels before they loaded at Novorossiysk.\n\nThe \"shadow fleet\" is a collection of hundreds of vessels that Moscow uses to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports, a major source of revenue. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly urged Kyiv's international partners to do more to prevent the ships from operating.\n\n\"The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce the receipt of petrodollars to the budget of the Russian Federation,\" the security source said on Wednesday, according to a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\nUkraine has been stepping up its attacks against the Russian energy sector, the revenue from which fuels its war efforts, in recent months. Kyiv has used long-range drones to strike oil refineries and other facilities and infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe three tanker attacks appear to reflect a new shift for Ukraine — one that now increasingly attacks ships at sea rather than just land targets.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Almost four years into Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine, European Union leaders have committed to funding Kyiv’s economic and military needs for the next two years, one way or another. Ukraine is desperate and needs the money by early 2026.\n\nAt a summit next week, the 27 EU leaders will weigh whether to use tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to help meet Ukraine’s requirements, which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion).\n\nSuch a move has never been done before, and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries' money, it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.\n\nBelgium, where most of the assets are held, is the main opponent of the plan. It’s fearful that Russia will strike back, either through the courts or in more nefarious ways. A series of drone incidents near airports and military bases last month suggested that the Kremlin was already doing so, but those responsible were never publicly identified.\n\nEuropean Council President Antonio Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit, has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision.\n\nEU leaders froze the money, most of it in Russian Central Bank assets, over the war that Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the scheme as “theft.”\n\nTwo plans have emerged. The first would be a “reparations loan” that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Russian President Vladimir Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.\n\nPlan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets, much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany of Europe’s major economies are cash strapped and mired in debt. But Russia’s war on Ukraine poses an existential threat to the bloc. Intelligence assessments suggest that Putin could launch a war elsewhere in three to five years should he defeat Ukraine.\n\nThe assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, estimates that 210 billion ($244 billion) euros worth of frozen assets are currently held in Europe. The vast majority — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.\n\nThere are political advantages too. Should the EU choose to use the assets, only “a qualified majority” of countries — around a two-thirds majority — would be required for a green light. Borrowing on financial markets would have to be endorsed by all, meaning that even a single no vote would sink the idea.\n\nOver the last year, Hungary has blocked EU support for Ukraine at almost every turn. The government in Slovakia is starting to dig in its heels as well. A new and stridently nationalist leader in the Czech Republic could further complicate the decision.\n\nAvoiding a veto is in the interest of the vast majority of member countries.\n\nDetails of the reparations loan\n\nUnveiling her plan on Dec. 4, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s needs for 2026 and 2027, for a total of 90 billion euros ($105 billion). International partners would fill the gap.\n\nDue to EU sanctions on Russia’s assets, cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. They’ve generated interest — some 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion) this year, Euroclear says — which is already being used to fund a Group of Seven loan plan for Ukraine.\n\nUnder the new plan, some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc’s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.\n\nThe commission insists that there is no “theft,” as Russia has claimed, because the right of the Russian Central Bank to make a claim on its money and Euroclear’s duty to repay will remain intact.\n\nOnce Putin pays war reparations, Ukraine would repay the EU, the EU would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay the Russian Central Bank.\n\nImportantly for Belgium, the plan contains safeguards to ensure that the risks would be shared by its partners. Other EU countries would offer to guarantee the loan if something went wrong. Germany has already signaled that it would do so.\n\nBut the Belgian government has not been assuaged. Even before the commission's reparations loan plan was made public, Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that it “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks.”\n\nPrévot said Belgium — a strong backer of Ukraine that has provided military and financial support — feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.\n\n“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return,” he said.\n\nIn an interview with Belgian public broadcaster RTBF last week, Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain also said that court action could not be ruled out should the EU oblige the clearinghouse to transfer its Russian assets.",

    "fullText": "Ground drones are growing more popular on Ukraine's front lines, but they're still vastly overshadowed by the small aerial drones made famous in the war.\n\nIn November, uncrewed ground vehicles accounted for less than 0.66% of Ukraine's total drone missions.\n\nUsage numbers were announced on Tuesday by Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, as he gave a statement on the war situation this winter.\n\n\"At the current stage of the war, it is unmanned aerial vehicles that provide about 60% of all strikes on enemy targets,\" Syrskyi wrote.\n\nThe military chief said that in November alone, Ukrainian uncrewed aerial vehicles, or UAVs, carried out over 304,000 missions, striking or destroying roughly 81,500 targets.\n\n\"Over the past six months, this indicator has been constantly growing,\" Syrskyi added.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian uncrewed ground vehicles, or UGVs, carried out 2,000 missions in the same timeframe, he said.\n\nThe statistics underscore just how aerial drones continue to dominate the battlefield in Ukraine. UGVs, an emerging technology, are still finding their footing in the war as Kyiv moves to integrate them at a wider scale among its military units.\n\nAmid the push, dozens of Ukrainian companies and units have been debuting their own UGVs, which can range from miniature buggies to full-size trucks mounted with remote machine gun turrets.\n\nThe ground drones are particularly useful because they can perform dangerous frontline missions that human soldiers would otherwise be required to carry out. Ukrainians are building them to serve a variety of purposes, from direct assaults and mine-clearing to monitoring roads and delivering frontline supplies.\n\nSome units have begun using aerial and ground systems in tandem, such as troops in Pokrovsk who used a UGV to spot incoming Russian vehicles through fog and later attacked with exploding drones.\n\nRussia has also been pioneering new drones, including UGVs for logistics and rocket artillery. On the aerial front, the Kremlin's forces were the first to introduce unjammable, fiber-optic drones that are now proliferating on the battlefield.\n\nThis year, Moscow has repeatedly been reported to be more readily integrating drone warfare into its ranks, scaling up mass production, forming official drone units, and creating new warfighting doctrine after observing Ukrainian tactics.\n\nSyrskyi wrote that Russia had, at one point, reached a \"period of a certain parity\" with Ukraine in the use of first-person-view drones, or the small hobby drones souped up to fly explosives into targets.\n\n\"As reported by our intelligence bodies, the enemy seeks to reach monthly deliveries of up to half a million FPV drones to its troops,\" he wrote.\n\nNow, however, Syrskyi claimed that Ukraine has recently surpassed Russia in first-person-view drone usage.\n\n\"The Ukrainian response must be asymmetric and effective: strengthening the fight against enemy drones and destroying the infrastructure of the enemy's unmanned forces units,\" he added.\n\nSyrskyi's statement offered a grim recap of the war in recent months, saying that Ukraine's forces have \"faced some of the most serious challenges since the beginning of the full-scale war.\"\n\nBoth civilians and soldiers in the country must soon grapple with another brutal winter, as temperatures are expected to consistently drop below freezing in January and February. Russia has been targeting local energy grids, disrupting Ukraine's access to reliable heating.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had no time to hold a traditional news conference during a whirlwind, 36-hour trip across Europe this week, so he improvised.\n\nFor the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of his country, Zelenskyy — who usually takes reporters’ questions in person while trotting the globe — communicated with the news media via group chat. While flying between London and Brussels, he answered a long list of questions from Ukrainian and international reporters, relaying audio clips on WhatsApp.\n\nHis chosen mode of communication was, if not unprecedented, at the very least extremely rare for a world leader.\n\nThe low drone of the aircraft blended with his hoarse, tired-sounding voice, yet his message cut through clearly: Amid uncertain negotiations to end the war, Ukraine, he said, cannot surrender land.\n\n“Undoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories,” he said in a crackling message late Monday. “According to the law, we don’t have such a right … and to be frank, we don’t have a moral right either.”\n\nWith the outlook for negotiations changing by the day, Zelenskyy’s team set out on a jam-packed schedule to shore up support in Europe.\n\nZelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nA key issue being discussed is whether Ukraine should cede Russian‑occupied territory in return for security guarantees, but the talks have been complicated by uncertainty about the Trump administration’s commitment to European security.\n\nSince the start of the war, Zelenskyy has shown a desire to communicate in real-time in whatever way is necessary.\n\nWhen Kyiv came under siege shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Zelenskyy tried to reassure the public through what appeared to be a cellphone video with three top officials — perhaps his best-known address.\n\n“We are all here,” he said at the time. “Our soldiers are here, the citizens of our country are all here protecting our independence, and we are going to continue to do so.”\n\nSince then, Zelenskyy has made frequent communication a strategic priority in a sleep-defying cycle of video messages, remote speeches to Western parliaments and conferences, late-night posts and high-security public appearances.\n\nMonday night’s WhatsApp exchange wound down as his plane landed in Brussels, just before he was whisked into his next round of meetings.\n\nHe asked reporters: “How did you like this format? If it works for you, then when we have the opportunity, we’ll share our thoughts and decisions this way again.”\n\nIt didn't take long. By Tuesday evening, Zelenskyy had sent reporters more audio messages on WhatsApp to explain how talks to end the war were proceeding with its Western allies.",

    "description": "With the proliferation of drones on the battlefield in Ukraine, European militaries are racing to better arm their forces.",
    "fullText": "European militaries are showing growing interest in a technology that turns standard service rifles into last-resort drone killers, an Israeli weapons maker says, as countries look for cheaper ways to counter the surge in uncrewed systems.\n\nA representative of firearms manufacturer Israel Weapon Industries told Business Insider that at least 10 European countries have either purchased or shown interest in the Arbel system, a micro-computer intended to better optimize a gun for shooting down drones, since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022.\n\nIWI declined to name buyers and interested parties. But Europe has grown increasingly interested in anti-drone defenses.\n\nDrones have dominated the battlefield in this war, providing Ukraine and Russia with constant surveillance and precision-strike capabilities. As both sides develop cheap ways to deal with the threat, countries closely watching the conflict from the sidelines are investing in the same.\n\nIWI said that its Arbel system is already in use with an undisclosed number of militaries around the world, said Semion, the head of Europe for the company, who requested to be identified only by his first name for security reasons.\n\nHe said that by next year, given current trends, he expects that 40 to 50% of European countries will either have procured the Arbel system or be close to doing so, reflecting growing investment in cost-efficient anti-drone defenses across the continent.\n\nDrones of all shapes, sizes, and functions are playing key roles on the battlefield in Ukraine, but one of the most problematic for soldiers on both sides is the small quadcopter known as a first-person-view (FPV) system.\n\nFPV drones are often armed with explosives that turn them into inexpensive precision-strike weapons. To defeat them, soldiers use signal jamming to interfere with their signal connections.\n\nHowever, FPV drones are increasingly being controlled by fiber-optic cables that connect directly with an operator rather than radio frequencies, making them immune to electronic warfare. The only option is to shoot them down with small arms, but even that requires precision and a lot of luck.\n\nDrones are hard targets to hit, in many cases, with anything other than a shotgun, and even then, there's no guarantee. They can move quickly and in unexpected ways.\n\nWith drones cementing themselves as a permanent feature of the modern battlefield, militaries are racing to acquire personal anti-drone defenses, like Arbel, in case soldiers find themselves on the receiving end of one of these weapons.\n\nArbel is a tiny computerized system that can be integrated into light machine guns or assault rifles, giving a soldier a more accurate shot on the battlefield in scenarios that require quick reactions or against moving targets — such as small drones, Semion said.\n\nWhen activated, the system lets a soldier hold down the trigger while Arbel automatically releases rounds at the moments they're most likely to hit the target. It can bring down drones at roughly 450 meters in daylight and 200 meters at night.\n\nThe system's sensors study the shooter's behavior — their weapon movement, stability, and trigger pressure. With the trigger held down, all the soldier needs to do is keep the drone in their sight; Arbel decides exactly when each round should go.\n\nArbel is battery-powered and adds about 400 grams to the gun, and soldiers can adapt quickly. Semion said the system is inexpensive but declined to disclose any specifics on the cost.\n\nSemion likened the system to equipping a soldier with a helmet and bulletproof vest, saying that drones today \"are the new bullets on the battlefield.\"\n\nArbel itself doesn't necessarily know what it's shooting at. Semion said it's up to the soldier to engage targets responsibly.\n\nEarly versions of Arbel have been on the market for a few years now, but only recently — after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and drone usage exploded on the battlefield — has the system been viewed as a viable anti-drone solution.\n\nEuropean nations, in particular, are acutely aware of the rising drone threat, and there is increasing demand for counter-drone solutions.\n\nArbel is one of several systems that offers to help soldiers use small arms to battle the drone threat without needing to pack on too much extra gear.\n\nLast year, Business Insider observed US soldiers training to shoot down drones with the Smart Shooter — a rifle equipped with a special optic that tracks the threat, calculates its trajectory, and notifies the user when they have a reasonable chance of hitting it.\n\nAnd this year, Business Insider observed AimLock target recognition technology at a special operations event, where the company's CEO talked about how this tech could support the counter-drone fight by enhancing various weapons.\n\nBeyond rifle attachments and fresh pitches for shotguns as drone defense, Western countries are also racing to develop interceptor drones as an anti-drone capability, following Ukraine, which has invested heavily in the production of these small systems and uses them widely to take down Russian threats.",
