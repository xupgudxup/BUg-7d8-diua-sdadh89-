    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Almost four years into Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine, European Union leaders have committed to funding Kyiv’s economic and military needs for the next two years, one way or another. Ukraine is desperate and needs the money by early 2026.\n\nAt a summit next week, the 27 EU leaders will weigh whether to use tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to help meet Ukraine’s requirements, which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion).\n\nSuch a move has never been done before, and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries' money, it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.\n\nBelgium, where most of the assets are held, is the main opponent of the plan. It’s fearful that Russia will strike back, either through the courts or in more nefarious ways. A series of drone incidents near airports and military bases last month suggested that the Kremlin was already doing so, but those responsible were never publicly identified.\n\nEuropean Council President Antonio Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit, has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision.\n\nEU leaders froze the money, most of it in Russian Central Bank assets, over the war that Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the scheme as “theft.”\n\nTwo plans have emerged. The first would be a “reparations loan” that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Russian President Vladimir Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.\n\nPlan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets, much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany of Europe’s major economies are cash strapped and mired in debt. But Russia’s war on Ukraine poses an existential threat to the bloc. Intelligence assessments suggest that Putin could launch a war elsewhere in three to five years should he defeat Ukraine.\n\nThe assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, estimates that 210 billion ($244 billion) euros worth of frozen assets are currently held in Europe. The vast majority — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.\n\nThere are political advantages too. Should the EU choose to use the assets, only “a qualified majority” of countries — around a two-thirds majority — would be required for a green light. Borrowing on financial markets would have to be endorsed by all, meaning that even a single no vote would sink the idea.\n\nOver the last year, Hungary has blocked EU support for Ukraine at almost every turn. The government in Slovakia is starting to dig in its heels as well. A new and stridently nationalist leader in the Czech Republic could further complicate the decision.\n\nAvoiding a veto is in the interest of the vast majority of member countries.\n\nDetails of the reparations loan\n\nUnveiling her plan on Dec. 4, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s needs for 2026 and 2027, for a total of 90 billion euros ($105 billion). International partners would fill the gap.\n\nDue to EU sanctions on Russia’s assets, cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. They’ve generated interest — some 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion) this year, Euroclear says — which is already being used to fund a Group of Seven loan plan for Ukraine.\n\nUnder the new plan, some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc’s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.\n\nThe commission insists that there is no “theft,” as Russia has claimed, because the right of the Russian Central Bank to make a claim on its money and Euroclear’s duty to repay will remain intact.\n\nOnce Putin pays war reparations, Ukraine would repay the EU, the EU would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay the Russian Central Bank.\n\nImportantly for Belgium, the plan contains safeguards to ensure that the risks would be shared by its partners. Other EU countries would offer to guarantee the loan if something went wrong. Germany has already signaled that it would do so.\n\nBut the Belgian government has not been assuaged. Even before the commission's reparations loan plan was made public, Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that it “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks.”\n\nPrévot said Belgium — a strong backer of Ukraine that has provided military and financial support — feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.\n\n“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return,” he said.\n\nIn an interview with Belgian public broadcaster RTBF last week, Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain also said that court action could not be ruled out should the EU oblige the clearinghouse to transfer its Russian assets.",

    "fullText": "Ground drones are growing more popular on Ukraine's front lines, but they're still vastly overshadowed by the small aerial drones made famous in the war.\n\nIn November, uncrewed ground vehicles accounted for less than 0.66% of Ukraine's total drone missions.\n\nUsage numbers were announced on Tuesday by Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, as he gave a statement on the war situation this winter.\n\n\"At the current stage of the war, it is unmanned aerial vehicles that provide about 60% of all strikes on enemy targets,\" Syrskyi wrote.\n\nThe military chief said that in November alone, Ukrainian uncrewed aerial vehicles, or UAVs, carried out over 304,000 missions, striking or destroying roughly 81,500 targets.\n\n\"Over the past six months, this indicator has been constantly growing,\" Syrskyi added.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian uncrewed ground vehicles, or UGVs, carried out 2,000 missions in the same timeframe, he said.\n\nThe statistics underscore just how aerial drones continue to dominate the battlefield in Ukraine. UGVs, an emerging technology, are still finding their footing in the war as Kyiv moves to integrate them at a wider scale among its military units.\n\nAmid the push, dozens of Ukrainian companies and units have been debuting their own UGVs, which can range from miniature buggies to full-size trucks mounted with remote machine gun turrets.\n\nThe ground drones are particularly useful because they can perform dangerous frontline missions that human soldiers would otherwise be required to carry out. Ukrainians are building them to serve a variety of purposes, from direct assaults and mine-clearing to monitoring roads and delivering frontline supplies.\n\nSome units have begun using aerial and ground systems in tandem, such as troops in Pokrovsk who used a UGV to spot incoming Russian vehicles through fog and later attacked with exploding drones.\n\nRussia has also been pioneering new drones, including UGVs for logistics and rocket artillery. On the aerial front, the Kremlin's forces were the first to introduce unjammable, fiber-optic drones that are now proliferating on the battlefield.\n\nThis year, Moscow has repeatedly been reported to be more readily integrating drone warfare into its ranks, scaling up mass production, forming official drone units, and creating new warfighting doctrine after observing Ukrainian tactics.\n\nSyrskyi wrote that Russia had, at one point, reached a \"period of a certain parity\" with Ukraine in the use of first-person-view drones, or the small hobby drones souped up to fly explosives into targets.\n\n\"As reported by our intelligence bodies, the enemy seeks to reach monthly deliveries of up to half a million FPV drones to its troops,\" he wrote.\n\nNow, however, Syrskyi claimed that Ukraine has recently surpassed Russia in first-person-view drone usage.\n\n\"The Ukrainian response must be asymmetric and effective: strengthening the fight against enemy drones and destroying the infrastructure of the enemy's unmanned forces units,\" he added.\n\nSyrskyi's statement offered a grim recap of the war in recent months, saying that Ukraine's forces have \"faced some of the most serious challenges since the beginning of the full-scale war.\"\n\nBoth civilians and soldiers in the country must soon grapple with another brutal winter, as temperatures are expected to consistently drop below freezing in January and February. Russia has been targeting local energy grids, disrupting Ukraine's access to reliable heating.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had no time to hold a traditional news conference during a whirlwind, 36-hour trip across Europe this week, so he improvised.\n\nFor the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of his country, Zelenskyy — who usually takes reporters’ questions in person while trotting the globe — communicated with the news media via group chat. While flying between London and Brussels, he answered a long list of questions from Ukrainian and international reporters, relaying audio clips on WhatsApp.\n\nHis chosen mode of communication was, if not unprecedented, at the very least extremely rare for a world leader.\n\nThe low drone of the aircraft blended with his hoarse, tired-sounding voice, yet his message cut through clearly: Amid uncertain negotiations to end the war, Ukraine, he said, cannot surrender land.\n\n“Undoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories,” he said in a crackling message late Monday. “According to the law, we don’t have such a right … and to be frank, we don’t have a moral right either.”\n\nWith the outlook for negotiations changing by the day, Zelenskyy’s team set out on a jam-packed schedule to shore up support in Europe.\n\nZelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nA key issue being discussed is whether Ukraine should cede Russian‑occupied territory in return for security guarantees, but the talks have been complicated by uncertainty about the Trump administration’s commitment to European security.\n\nSince the start of the war, Zelenskyy has shown a desire to communicate in real-time in whatever way is necessary.\n\nWhen Kyiv came under siege shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Zelenskyy tried to reassure the public through what appeared to be a cellphone video with three top officials — perhaps his best-known address.\n\n“We are all here,” he said at the time. “Our soldiers are here, the citizens of our country are all here protecting our independence, and we are going to continue to do so.”\n\nSince then, Zelenskyy has made frequent communication a strategic priority in a sleep-defying cycle of video messages, remote speeches to Western parliaments and conferences, late-night posts and high-security public appearances.\n\nMonday night’s WhatsApp exchange wound down as his plane landed in Brussels, just before he was whisked into his next round of meetings.\n\nHe asked reporters: “How did you like this format? If it works for you, then when we have the opportunity, we’ll share our thoughts and decisions this way again.”\n\nIt didn't take long. By Tuesday evening, Zelenskyy had sent reporters more audio messages on WhatsApp to explain how talks to end the war were proceeding with its Western allies.",

    "description": "With the proliferation of drones on the battlefield in Ukraine, European militaries are racing to better arm their forces.",
    "fullText": "European militaries are showing growing interest in a technology that turns standard service rifles into last-resort drone killers, an Israeli weapons maker says, as countries look for cheaper ways to counter the surge in uncrewed systems.\n\nA representative of firearms manufacturer Israel Weapon Industries told Business Insider that at least 10 European countries have either purchased or shown interest in the Arbel system, a micro-computer intended to better optimize a gun for shooting down drones, since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022.\n\nIWI declined to name buyers and interested parties. But Europe has grown increasingly interested in anti-drone defenses.\n\nDrones have dominated the battlefield in this war, providing Ukraine and Russia with constant surveillance and precision-strike capabilities. As both sides develop cheap ways to deal with the threat, countries closely watching the conflict from the sidelines are investing in the same.\n\nIWI said that its Arbel system is already in use with an undisclosed number of militaries around the world, said Semion, the head of Europe for the company, who requested to be identified only by his first name for security reasons.\n\nHe said that by next year, given current trends, he expects that 40 to 50% of European countries will either have procured the Arbel system or be close to doing so, reflecting growing investment in cost-efficient anti-drone defenses across the continent.\n\nDrones of all shapes, sizes, and functions are playing key roles on the battlefield in Ukraine, but one of the most problematic for soldiers on both sides is the small quadcopter known as a first-person-view (FPV) system.\n\nFPV drones are often armed with explosives that turn them into inexpensive precision-strike weapons. To defeat them, soldiers use signal jamming to interfere with their signal connections.\n\nHowever, FPV drones are increasingly being controlled by fiber-optic cables that connect directly with an operator rather than radio frequencies, making them immune to electronic warfare. The only option is to shoot them down with small arms, but even that requires precision and a lot of luck.\n\nDrones are hard targets to hit, in many cases, with anything other than a shotgun, and even then, there's no guarantee. They can move quickly and in unexpected ways.\n\nWith drones cementing themselves as a permanent feature of the modern battlefield, militaries are racing to acquire personal anti-drone defenses, like Arbel, in case soldiers find themselves on the receiving end of one of these weapons.\n\nArbel is a tiny computerized system that can be integrated into light machine guns or assault rifles, giving a soldier a more accurate shot on the battlefield in scenarios that require quick reactions or against moving targets — such as small drones, Semion said.\n\nWhen activated, the system lets a soldier hold down the trigger while Arbel automatically releases rounds at the moments they're most likely to hit the target. It can bring down drones at roughly 450 meters in daylight and 200 meters at night.\n\nThe system's sensors study the shooter's behavior — their weapon movement, stability, and trigger pressure. With the trigger held down, all the soldier needs to do is keep the drone in their sight; Arbel decides exactly when each round should go.\n\nArbel is battery-powered and adds about 400 grams to the gun, and soldiers can adapt quickly. Semion said the system is inexpensive but declined to disclose any specifics on the cost.\n\nSemion likened the system to equipping a soldier with a helmet and bulletproof vest, saying that drones today \"are the new bullets on the battlefield.\"\n\nArbel itself doesn't necessarily know what it's shooting at. Semion said it's up to the soldier to engage targets responsibly.\n\nEarly versions of Arbel have been on the market for a few years now, but only recently — after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and drone usage exploded on the battlefield — has the system been viewed as a viable anti-drone solution.\n\nEuropean nations, in particular, are acutely aware of the rising drone threat, and there is increasing demand for counter-drone solutions.\n\nArbel is one of several systems that offers to help soldiers use small arms to battle the drone threat without needing to pack on too much extra gear.\n\nLast year, Business Insider observed US soldiers training to shoot down drones with the Smart Shooter — a rifle equipped with a special optic that tracks the threat, calculates its trajectory, and notifies the user when they have a reasonable chance of hitting it.\n\nAnd this year, Business Insider observed AimLock target recognition technology at a special operations event, where the company's CEO talked about how this tech could support the counter-drone fight by enhancing various weapons.\n\nBeyond rifle attachments and fresh pitches for shotguns as drone defense, Western countries are also racing to develop interceptor drones as an anti-drone capability, following Ukraine, which has invested heavily in the production of these small systems and uses them widely to take down Russian threats.",
