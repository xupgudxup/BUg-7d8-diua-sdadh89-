    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's launch of an Oreshnik hypersonic missile appears aimed at intimidating Ukraine and sending a signal of Russian military might to Europe and the United States at a crucial juncture in talks to end the war.\n\nPutin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024. Since then, it has kept the weapon in reserve.\n\nThe overnight Oreshnik strike in western Ukraine came after a week of setbacks for Russia. ‌On Saturday, President Donald Trump sent U.S. special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close Putin ally, and on Wednesday U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the north Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain and France announced plans to deploy troops in Ukraine ‌in the event of a ceasefire - prompting Moscow to respond that it would view foreign soldiers as legitimate combat targets.\n\nGerhard Mangott, a Russia specialist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said Moscow was frustrated at being sidelined during weeks of diplomacy between the U.S., Ukraine and the Europeans, and \"particularly mad\" about the planned potential troop deployment by Kyiv's European allies. The use of the Oreshnik should be seen in that context, he said.\n\n\"It's a signal to the United States and the Europeans about the military capabilities of the Russian army,\" Mangott said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe said Moscow wanted to convey that \"Russia is to be taken seriously, given its military arsenal, ⁠and that the Europeans and Trump should return to a minimum of respect ‌for the Russian position in the negotiations.\"\n\n'DESTRUCTION NOT NECESSARILY THE GOAL'\n\nThe Oreshnik is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, although there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the latest attack.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the missile struck a state enterprise in the western city of Lviv and ‍was likely carrying inert or \"dummy\" warheads - as in 2024, when Russia first fired it to test the weapon in war.\n\n\"It does appear that at this point Russia is using Oreshnik for signaling purposes, so the destruction is not necessarily the goal,\" Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, told Reuters when asked if the use of dummy warheads would diminish the capacity of Moscow's action to intimidate Ukraine and its allies.\n\n\"It's probably a general signal of resolve ​to escalate. My guess is that it will be read this way by the West,\" he said.\n\nWestern reaction to the attack, around 60 km (40 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland, was swift. ‌The leaders of Britain, France and Germany called it \"escalatory and unacceptable\". European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"a clear escalation against Ukraine and meant as a warning to Europe and to the U.S.\".\n\nRUSSIAN STATEMENT ON REASON FOR MISSILE USE DRAWS SCEPTICISM\n\nRussia specialist Mangott was sceptical about the official statement from Russia's Defence Ministry that the Oreshnik launch was in response to an alleged Ukraine drone strike targeting one of Putin's residences, in the northern region of Novgorod, late last month. Ukraine has denied any such attack took place, accusing Moscow of lying about it in order to derail peace talks.\n\nSeveral high-profile Russian war bloggers also criticised the official framing of the strike as a revenge attack. One, Yuri Baranchik, suggested it would have \"looked more convincing\" if Moscow had fired the missile at President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's bunker in Kyiv.\n\nMick Ryan, ⁠an Australian military expert, linked the weapon's use to Russia's recent setbacks, especially over Venezuela.\n\nHe said the point was \"to demonstrate ​that Russia remains a nuclear-armed world power. In this guise, it is a psychological weapon – an instrument of Putin’s cognitive war ​against Ukraine and the West – rather than a weapon of mass physical destruction.\"\n\nRussian arch-hawk Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Putin's Security Council, alluded in a social media post to the capture of Maduro, the oil tanker seizure by the U.S. and the possibility of further U.S. sanctions against Russia, which he ‍said had made for a \"stormy\" start to the year.\n\nIn ⁠comments highly critical of Washington, he said international relations had descended into a madhouse and compared the Oreshnik strike to \"a life-saving injection of haloperidol\", an anti-psychotic drug.\n\nProminent Russian war blogger Fighterbomber, a former military serviceman, said he thought the use of the Oreshnik was a display of power to convey a message and that Moscow would not be resorting to it often.\n\nHe noted that ⁠some Oreshnik systems had been transferred to Belarus and that Russia would have some of its own in reserve, but suggested that there was not an endless supply of the relatively new missile.\n\n\"Taking all these constants into account, we can assume that ‌we can afford to conduct such demonstrations two or three times a year,\" he wrote.\n\nHe expressed hope that no further launches would be needed for now, concluding: \"The signals have ‌been sent and they have been heard.\"",

    "description": "Ukrainian cities have set up hundreds of \"invincibility points\" in preparation for a rare mass blackout event like this week's.",
    "fullText": "A new wave of Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure has put two of its biggest regions to the test, as local cities rolled out plans for dealing with their worst blackouts in years.\n\nTheir prepared \"blackout mode\" response provides some insight into how urban centers might steel themselves for energy crises in wartime, especially during cold months. Ukraine's winter can turn brutal in January and February, when temperatures typically drop to 18°F.\n\nMass blackouts can also disrupt water and sewage systems, hospitals, public transportation, and road control, including traffic lights.\n\nBoth Ukrainian troops and civilians have long learned to cope with frequent energy shortages in the winter, maintaining backup generators, battery-powered lamps, and stockpiles of coal or gas.\n\nBut Moscow's latest attacks on Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk, two eastern Ukrainian regions, plunged both areas into almost total darkness this week.\n\nRegional leaders have described it as their biggest energy crisis since 2022, when Ukrainians first faced wartime power outages. Borys Filatov, the mayor of Dnipro, Dnipropetrovsk's largest city, said the situation there was one of the most severe in the country and had risen to the level of a \"national emergency.\"\n\n\"This is the first total blackout in the entire region in recent years,\" Ivan Fedorov, Zaporizhzhia's governor, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nAs national authorities reported that over 1 million people had lost heat and water, local officials rushed to restore power and open access to facilities prearranged for the blackouts.\n\nOne of their prepared responses was to deploy \"invincibility points,\" or earmarked emergency shelters equipped with heat, communication, and basic necessities.\n\nSome local governments publish a map with available locations for civilians. The city of Dnipro, for example, maintains a list of mostly schools, municipality buildings, and metro stations designated as safe spots.\n\nCivilians are meant to visit these shelters to \"warm up, charge your gadgets, and wait out the power outage,\" per the municipal government.\n\nA video published by Oleksy Kuleba, Ukraine's vice prime minister for reconstruction and the minister for community and territorial development, showed one point in Dnipropetrovsk that appears to be located in a small convenience store.\n\nKuleba said the region's energy sector had been hit with a \"massive blow,\" and that over 5,000 people visited 500 such locations in the city of Dnipro within 24 hours after the power outages began.\n\nKuleba added that neighboring regions in Ukraine had donated 45 generators to Dnipropetrovsk, where some of its trains had switched to burning onboard fuel for power.\n\nZaporizhzhia's governor, Fedorov, also said on Thursday that the region had 400 established invincibility points, with 200 ready for visitors within two hours.\n\n\"Residents could warm up, call their relatives, drink hot tea, and, if necessary, stay overnight,\" he said.\n\nFilatov, Dnipro's mayor, said on Thursday that the city had set up 130 water dispensers, which his staff marked on Google Maps, and that disrupted public transport would be temporarily replaced by buses.\n\nHospitals were already equipped with alternative power sources and necessities, while parts of the city, on the western bank of the Dnipro River, were supported by backup power, he added.\n\n\"The city's sewage system is also powered,\" Filatov said.\n\nNotably, Filatov said that while authorities had extended local school holidays to January 11, kindergartens would operate on four-hour shifts \"because it's clear that parents are also in a difficult situation.\"\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, Fedorov said the region had been left \"completely without electricity\" on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We immediately went into 'blackout' mode and started working according to a clear plan,\" he said.\n\nZaporizhzhia's hospitals similarly switched to backup power within minutes, and the region's traffic lights \"worked autonomously,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian officials have since said that power has been partially returned to both regions, with Kuleba reporting on late Thursday evening that water and heating in Dnipropetrovsk had been restored to over 1.7 million people and 270,000 people, respectively.\n\nEnergy supplier DTEK said that around 700,000 families in the Dnipropetrovsk region once again had access to electricity, though it added that Russian bombing was continuing.\n\n\"An exhausting day for energy workers in the Dnipropetrovsk region,\" the company said.\n\nFedorov warned repeatedly on Thursday evening of incoming drone and guided missile strikes over Zaporizhzhia. He later said that Russia had carried out over 728 strikes, including drone attacks, artillery shelling, and multiple-launch rocket system strikes across Ukraine that day.\n\nBoth Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk are close to the southern and eastern front lines in Ukraine.\n\nKyiv has often accused Russia of specifically targeting energy infrastructure during the winter to exhaust and punish Ukrainian civilians, which is a war crime but is often difficult to prove.\n\nThe Kremlin has often responded that its strikes were intended for legitimate military targets, though the years have shown that critical facilities are regularly damaged or destroyed by the attacks.\n\n\"There is no military sense in such strikes on the energy sector, on infrastructure, which leave people without electricity and heating in winter conditions,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday.",

    "description": "Ukraine's commander in chief said December was the first month that its drones \"neutralized\" roughly as many Russians as were called up.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's top general said that for the first time in the war, its drones are killing or seriously wounding Russia's soldiers as fast as it can get new troops into the field.\n\nDrones are the top battlefield threat, responsible for the most casualties in this war. Ukraine relies heavily on them, especially the cheap first-person-view drones, as solutions to its manpower and equipment shortages.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Tuesday in a Telegram post that December was the first month in which Ukraine's uncrewed systems units \"neutralized\" about as many Russian servicemen as it called up in a month.\n\nHe said video confirmed 33,000 Russian losses last month. \"The real losses of the occupiers are greater,\" the general said.\n\nSyrskyi did not provide a number for the number of Russian soldiers called up. Business Insider is unable to independently confirm Syrskyi's claims.\n\nRussia hasn't provided official casualty figures. As for the number of new Russian soldiers sent to Ukraine each month, a US assessment put the number around 30,000 last April. In May, however, the Russian president said that the number was twice that. A Ukrainian intelligence assessment in December said that Russia fulfilled its 2025 mobilization target of 403,000, an average of more than 36,000 a month.\n\nRussia's armed forces in Ukraine are a mixed bag of contract soldiers who volunteer for the fight — Russia attracts volunteers with various perks, like signing bonuses — conscripts pulled in through draft cycles, and other sources. Russia has previously recruited people out of its prisons.\n\nThough exact losses are unclear, Ukrainian and Western intel assessments point to substantial attrition. Russia has a much larger population to draw soldiers from than Ukraine, which is also said to have suffered significant losses in this war. Some estimates put Russian losses at 1,000 troops a day.\n\nWhile Russia has a larger population to pull from, it has tried to avoid repeated large-scale involuntary mobilizations.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin publicly promised not to send conscripts to the front lines, fearing fallout. It has limited what Russia can do with them, even though widespread reporting and captured conscripts say assurances have been misleading.\n\nSyrskyi called 2025 a great breakthrough for Ukraine's drone war and pledged that it would not stop, with plans to grow capabilities further in 2026.\n\nHe said that in December, the number of targets that were hit or destroyed by drones rose by 31% and that the number of Russian personnel hit rose by more than 25%.\n\nSyrskyi said in November that uncrewed systems were responsible for about 60 % of all enemy targets hit. That figure has also been higher, at times, in front-line areas.\n\nDrones directly attack troops and equipment — either by carrying explosives or dropping weapons like grenades — and they also collect intelligence that shapes how armies employ other forces. Even inexpensive drones have had an outsized impact, destroying sophisticated, multimillion-dollar systems such as tanks.\n\nRussia and Ukraine are locked in a drone development race to field greater numbers and more advanced drones, as well as counter-drone technology.\n\nSyrskyi warned that Russia also has ambitious plans for its drones. He said that Russia copied Ukraine by creating a separate part of the military for uncrewed systems and said that it has 80,000 servicemen. He said Russia plans to expand that to 165,500 this year and to almost 210,000 by 2030.\n\nThere are so many drones in the sky that Ukrainian soldiers previously told Business Insider that they were sometimes unable to tell which side any belonged to and would instead try to bring them all down just to be on the safe side.",

    "fullText": "The lightning U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro can be seen as both a benefit and a burden for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose forces botched an attempt to capture Ukraine’s capital and topple its leader at the start of Moscow's invasion nearly four years ago.\n\nThe ouster of Maduro highlights another Kremlin failure to support an ally, following the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024 and last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran. With the U.S. determined to establish control over Venezuela, Russia stands to lose a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere, along with billions of dollars invested in its oil industry.\n\nBut President Donald Trump's actions in Venezuela also are causing unease in Western nations and giving the Kremlin fresh talking points to defend its war in Ukraine.\n\nIn addition, Trump’s interest in wresting control of Greenland from NATO ally Denmark also threatens to destabilize the alliance at the moment when the U.S.-led efforts to broker peace in Ukraine enter a pivotal stage, distracting its members from their efforts to support Kyiv and provide it with security guarantees.\n\nPutin himself hasn’t commented on the U.S. actions in Venezuela, which his diplomats have denounced as a blatant act of aggression. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president who serves as his deputy on the presidential Security Council, similarly rebuked Washington for trampling international law — but also complimented Trump on defending U.S. interests.\n\n“Even though Trump’s action is completely unlawful, he cannot be denied a certain consistency — he and his team are very aggressively upholding their country’s national interests,” Medvedev said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. said it seized two sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela, including one flagged to Russia in the North Atlantic.\n\nMoscow's ‘spheres of influence’\n\nSince 2014's illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that followed the ouster of a pro-Kremlin president in Kyiv, Putin has sought to justify his action by describing his neighbor as part of Russia’s sphere of influence where Western encroachment can’t be allowed.\n\nPutin has argued that just as the U.S. would bristle at any foreign military presence in the Western Hemisphere, Russia sees NATO’s expansion to its borders as a major security threat. He cited Ukraine’s bid to join the military alliance as a key reason behind his full-scale invasion of the country.\n\n“We have made it clear and unambiguous that further eastward expansion of NATO is unacceptable,” Putin said shortly before sending troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. “Are we the ones placing missiles near the U.S. borders? No, it’s the U.S. that has brought its missiles to our doorstep.”\n\nLong before the invasion, Russia tested the ground on a possible deal under which it would refrain from meddling in Latin America in exchange for the U.S. offering Moscow free rein in Europe.\n\nFiona Hill, who oversaw Russia and Europe on Trump's National Security Council during his first term, testified before Congress in 2019 that the Russians were signaling their willingness to make such an arrangement involving Venezuela and Ukraine.\n\nRussia never made a formal offer, Hill told The Associated Press in an interview, but Moscow’s then-ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, “hinted ... many times” to her that Russia could cede its influence in Venezuela to the U.S. in exchange for a sphere of influence in Europe.\n\nShe said Trump's administration wasn’t interested in the Russian overtures that she described as a “hint-hint, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, how-about-doing-a-deal” offer. In April 2019, Hill was sent to Moscow to convey the message that “nobody’s interested. ... Ukraine and Venezuela are not related to each other.”\n\nHill said she did not know if the winds have now changed and whether there was any deal between the U.S. and Russia to swap spheres of influence in Venezuela and Ukraine, but she noted that many officials, including herself, who were involved in “restraining” Trump in his first term aren't around for his second.\n\nShe argued that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio would likely be the only member of the Trump administration who would now resist such a proposal, but added that others, including Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, could have a different view.\n\n“Who knows what Witkoff and others have been chatting about recently?” Hill asked.\n\nBefore Maduro was captured, AP reported Russia had started evacuating families of diplomats from Venezuela. When asked about the move, Hill said it would not be “implausible” that Witkoff gave Moscow a “courtesy heads-up.”\n\nSam Greene, a Russia expert at King’s College London, observed that Moscow may have backed down on Venezuela in the expectation of the U.S. giving it a free hand on Ukraine.\n\n“My worry is that it may be part of a tacit agreement, by which Washington, Moscow and Beijing agree not to deter one another against interventions in their putative spheres of influence,” he wrote on X.\n\nRussia’s foothold in Western Hemisphere\n\nBefore the invasion of Ukraine, senior Russian officials had issued vague warnings that Moscow could deploy troops or military assets to Cuba and Venezuela — statements that the U.S. dismissed as bluster. Some drew parallels to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis — when the Soviet Union deployed missiles to Cuba and the U.S. imposed a naval blockade of the island.\n\nRussian-Cuban ties withered after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, plunging Cuba into a grueling depression. Soon after his first election in 2000, Putin ordered the closure of a Soviet-built military surveillance facility in Cuba as he sought to improve ties with Washington. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies mounted, however, Moscow again intensified trade and other contacts with Cuba and sent warships to visit the island.\n\nRussia also has invested heavily in Venezuela's oil industry, as did China, and offered Caracas generous loans to purchase top-of-the-line air defense missiles, fighter jets and other weapons. On several occasions, most recently in 2018, it dispatched its nuclear-capable Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela in a projection of force.\n\nMilitary experts have said, however, that any attempt by Russia to establish a permanent military foothold in the Western Hemisphere would face overwhelming logistical challenges.\n\nThe ‘might-makes-right’ doctrine\n\nThe U.S. seizure of Maduro and his wife was seen worldwide as the return of the “might- makes-right” doctrine, backing Moscow’s argument that its action in Ukraine protects its vital interests the way the U.S. did in Venezuela.\n\nAfter its action in Venezuela, the U.S. has “nothing to formally reproach our country for,” Medvedev noted.\n\nHill noted that Maduro’s capture makes it harder for countries to condemn Russia’s action in Ukraine because “we’ve just had a situation where the U.S. has taken over — or at least decapitated the government of another country — using fiction.”\n\nAn indictment accuses Maduro and others of working with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S.\n\nFyodor Lukyanov, a Kremlin-connected, Moscow-based foreign policy expert, observed that “if we consider what’s happening from the perspective of setting a precedent, then we couldn’t ask for anything better, and this includes Trump’s conviction that the authorities in Venezuela must be approved by Washington.”\n\nRussian hawks, meanwhile, argue the U.S. action in Venezuela has created a new sense of urgency for Moscow to dramatically speed up its offensive in Ukraine.\n\n“Ukraine under our full control is our pass to the Great Powers club,” Alexander Dugin, a hard-line nationalist ideologue, wrote in a commentary.\n\nAP European Security Correspondent Emma Burrows in London contributed.",

    "fullText": "One of Ukraine's first F-16 pilots said they had to create new tactics for the fighter because the West's original training didn't fit the war against Russia.\n\nUkraine's air force released a video interview on Monday with the pilot, whose name wasn't disclosed, in which he spoke about the F-16 Fighting Falcon's performance and the early challenges he faced when learning to fly the aircraft.\n\nThe pilot said he flew Kyiv's Soviet-made combat aircraft in the initial days of Russia's full-scale invasion, before being sent abroad to train to fly the F-16s donated by the West.\n\nOnce he returned to the war, he and his fellow pilots \"encountered reality,\" he said.\n\n\"The tactics that we were taught abroad do not entirely fit the war we have here, because those tactics are also based on wars in which the partners previously took part,\" the pilot said. \"And this war is fundamentally different from those wars.\"\n\nUkrainian pilots had to devise their own tactics, he said.\n\n\"How we would destroy cruise missiles, strike drones, how we would fight with the enemy near the line of combat contact,\" the pilot added.\n\nUkraine's Western allies have been taking note of some of those lessons, he added.\n\n\"When the partners see our effectiveness, they understand how, in our limited conditions, we are able to carry out flights with such effectiveness,\" he said. \"And they even, I would say, learn from us. They learn the tactics and adjust the tactics that they taught us when we were abroad.\"\n\nThe pilot didn't go into exact detail about the types of new tactics Ukrainians developed for the F-16, but spoke about a daring maneuver he recently conducted in the Donbas region.\n\nHe said his three-ship formation had encountered heavily saturated Russian defenses, including surface-to-air missile systems and unspecified air assets, that \"did not allow us the possibility to approach\" their target.\n\n\"We drew two missiles from the enemy, because there were two launches from different directions, and we gave the opportunity for our strike aircraft to destroy the target,\" he said.\n\nThe pilot said the entire group returned safely after the mission.\n\nUkraine has officially received 44 of the 87 F-16s that European nations have promised to donate to Kyiv. Its first crews for the American-made aircraft were trained in Romania, where a coalition of NATO member states, including the US, worked to teach Ukrainian pilots, technicians, and other staff to service and fly the planes.\n\nIn his interview, the pilot said the language barrier was one of his biggest challenges when learning to fly the F-16, and that while waiting to be sent abroad for training, he studied English grammar, colloquial language, and aviation terms as he rested between combat flights.\n\n\"It was very hard, because after a combat sortie, as a rule, a pilot has to rest, because he does not know whether at some moment he might fly again,\" he said.\n\nThe first of Ukraine's F-16s entered the war in August 2024 and were primarily used for defensive purposes against strike drones and cruise missiles.\n\nKyiv has since lost four of the aircraft, but its pilots have also been recorded achieving notable feats, including one reportedly destroying six missiles in a single flight.\n\nThe interviewed pilot praised the F-16 as a fighter that performs \"flawlessly,\" but also said he wished for the more advanced, Block 70/72 version of the aircraft. These latest iterations have been upgraded with fifth-generation technology, including powerful radars with stronger jamming resistance and a modernized cockpit.\n\n\"If we were given such an opportunity to carry out tasks on these aircraft, I think that in our tally there would be not only destroyed strike drones and cruise missiles, but also enemy aircraft that are carrying out tasks along the line of combat contact,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is now on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Moscow as his administration continues to negotiate a deal to end the war that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he met with Trump at the White House earlier Wednesday, during which the president “greenlit” the Russia sanctions bill that has been in the works for months.\n\nGraham had signaled previously that Trump has blessed the bill, only for it to encounter additional obstacles. But a White House official confirmed to The Associated Press Wednesday that the president supports the sanctions legislation.\n\n“This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent,” Graham said in a statement, referring to the Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe bill, chiefly written by Graham and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., allows the administration to impose tariffs and secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russia’s oil, gas, uranium and other exports. Doing so is meant to cut off the source of financing for much of Russia’s military actions.\n\nThe White House has previously insisted on some revisions and flexibility for Trump in the sanctions package, but the White House official on Wednesday did not elaborate on whether any changes were secured.\n\nThe legislation has dozens of co-sponsors in the Senate, as well as a companion bill in the House, drafted by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.\n\nGraham said there could be a vote as early as next week, although it’s unclear how likely that will be. The Senate is poised to take up a scaled-back government funding package next week that the House is currently considering, if the House passes it. The following week is a Senate recess timed to Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently trying to finalize a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, now nearly four years old, with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, as the U.S. president’s chief negotiators.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range, deep-strike drones to hit a Russian missile arsenal and oil depot supporting the invasion, a security official told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe attacks mark Ukraine's latest deep strikes as it continues to target Russian weapons and the country's vast energy sector, a major revenue source for the state as it wages war.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, said that drones hit Russia's 100th Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU) in the western Kostroma region. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe drone attack on the facility triggered a secondary detonation of ammunition, causing powerful blasts at the facility, the source said, calling it an important target because Russia uses it to supply munitions to smaller sites in other areas of the country.\n\nThe source said drones also struck an oil depot in the nearby Lipetsk region, sparking an \"intense\" blaze. Video footage and images shared on social media appeared to show fire and smoke at the two facilities.\n\nOvernight, Ukrainian attack drones successfully hit a Russian oil depot in the town of Usman, Lipetsk Oblast. Seen here, flames leap into the night sky from the burning facility. pic.twitter.com/EN6SRI2sXU\n\nRussia's defense ministry said on Tuesday that it shot down 360 Ukrainian drones without specifying where. Neither the ministry nor the Russian embassy in the US responded to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe SBU source said that the two drone attacks were carried out by its Alpha group, an elite \"spetsnaz\" unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces.\n\nThe Alpha group regularly carries out long-range drone attacks against Russian targets, including a recent first-of-its-kind strike on a Moscow-linked oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea and the stunning June attacks against Russian airbases, known as Operation Spiderweb.\n\nThe SBU's Alpha forces also carry out ground operations; for instance, they have participated in Ukraine's defense of Pokrovsk, the war-torn city in the eastern Donetsk region that has been the site of some of the conflict's most intense fighting.\n\n\"In the New Year, the SBU continues to work successfully on military and oil facilities of the Russian Federation, reducing the enemy's ability to provide their army with ammunition and fuel,\" the source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\n\"All Russian rear facilities that work for the war against Ukraine are absolutely legitimate targets,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drones to attack Russian energy facilities in a bid to put pressure on a key source of revenue for Moscow that helps fuel its war efforts.\n\nUkraine has mostly targeted oil and gas infrastructure on land, such as depots and ports, but in recent weeks, it has expanded attacks to maritime targets, striking several oil tankers and oil platforms in the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the deep-strike operations as the country's way of imposing \"long-range\" sanctions on Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday's attack on the 100th GRAU arsenal reflects a tactic that Ukraine has long relied on — hitting ammunition storage sites inside Russia to cause more near-term battlefield impacts.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy replaced the head of his powerful security agency on Monday, pressing ahead with a reshuffle of top officials as Russia's war in Ukraine nears the four-year mark with ​no end in sight despite intense diplomacy.\n\nThe removal of Vasyl Maliuk, who oversaw a series of assassinations and a surprise ‌operation codenamed \"Spiderweb\" that destroyed Russian warplanes, shakes up the leadership of a vast security agency at the heart of Ukraine's shadow war.\n\nZelenskiy named Major-General Yevhenii Khmara as the acting ‌head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), which Maliuk had run since 2022. The agency described Khmara as an experienced commander who had served in the elite Alfa combat unit since 2011 and led it since 2023.\n\nSOME COMMANDERS STAND BY MALIUK\n\nZelenskiy said on X he had asked Maliuk to focus on combat operations, adding: \"There must be more Ukrainian asymmetric operations against the occupier and the Russian state, and more solid results in eliminating the enemy.\"\n\nZelenskiy ⁠last week named military spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as ‌his chief of staff to replace Andriy Yermak, who was ousted in November amid a corruption scandal but denied wrongdoing.\n\nNew defence and energy ministers will also be named in a reshuffle that had been put on hold ‍during negotiations on a possible peace deal that produced no sign of a breakthrough.\n\nRussia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, holds about one-fifth of Ukrainian territory including Crimea, which it seized in 2014. Kyiv says the advances have come at huge losses for Russia.\n\nZelenskiy has also appointed First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsia ​as a first deputy to Budanov, bringing a member of Ukraine's negotiating team into his administration.\n\nSome commanders rushed to Maliuk's defence after ‌reports of his looming exit circulated at the weekend.\n\nDrone forces chief Robert Brovdi said replacing him risked weakening \"one of Ukraine's key contemporary heavyweight\" agencies fighting Russia.\n\nSolomiia Bobrovska, a lawmaker on the defence, security and intelligence committee, said she did not think Maliuk's removal was \"necessary today\".\n\n\"In my opinion, under Maliuk's leadership, the SBU has been doing its job successfully in the current political situation, balancing between political tasks, combat operations and economic issues,\" she told Reuters.\n\nShe said Zelenskiy had effectively bypassed parliament by appointing Khmara as placeholder by decree.\n\nMaliuk, a career SBU official, overhauled the ⁠SBU after replacing Ivan Bakanov, who was dismissed by Zelenskiy in July 2022 ​for failing to root out Russian spies.\n\nMaliuk's most sophisticated operation, Spiderweb, used small drones ​hidden in cargo trucks to attack dozens of Russian highly valuable strategic bombers at airbases far from Ukraine's usual strike capabilities in May 2025.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously, told Reuters Maliuk had been asked to run the smaller ‍foreign intelligence service instead of the ⁠SBU, but declined.\n\nThe foreign spy service has no chief after its previous head was put in charge of the military intelligence agency. The head of the border guard service has also been replaced, another sign of the extensive security and defence reshuffle underway.\n\nMykhailo ⁠Fedorov, Zelenskiy's choice as defence minister, has not yet been approved by parliament. Zelenskiy said on Monday he wanted him to focus on technology and innovation to \"counter Russia's ‌desire to make this war endless.\"",

    "description": "The push for tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a \"significant increase\" in tax collection and compliance this year as Russia's wartime economy continues to lose momentum.\n\nThe Kremlin announced the directive on Saturday following an early December meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects.\n\nA share of that increase is set to come from higher consumption taxes, which rose from 20% to 22% on January 1. This bump is expected to generate about 1 trillion rubles, or $12.3 billion, in tax revenues.\n\nRussia is also planning to introduce a new tax on electronics in September.\n\nThe push for more aggressive tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhile Russia's sanctions-hit wartime economy appeared resilient in the first years of the war, cracks are emerging as persistently low oil prices are taking a toll.\n\nIn November, GDP expanded by just 0.1% from a year ago, according to official data. Industrial output declined 0.7%.\n\nIn the third quarter, Russia's GDP grew 0.6% from a year ago — sharply lower than the 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first.\n\nPutin has also ordered officials to restore economic growth and investment activity, while addressing structural problems across key sectors of the economy.\n\nAt the same time, the government is expected to keep inflation in check, with the target rate by the end of 2026 set within the central bank's forecast range of 4% to 5% — down from below 6% expected in 2025 and 9.5% in 2024.\n\nOil prices fell 20% in 2025 due to ample supply and slowing demand growth.\n\nDevelopments in the global oil market could add to that pressure. The US raid on Venezuela over the weekend is set to change the calculus for energy markets.\n\n\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry wrote on Monday that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid- to long-term. He said tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nThat view was echoed by John E. Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who pointed to President Donald Trump's plans for Venezuelan oil.\n\n\"Trump has said he intends to put Venezuelan oil — still under tough sanctions — back on the market,\" wrote Herbst on Monday.\n\n\"While this may take some time, it will help him reach his goal of driving down oil prices for US (and therefore global) consumers. This will be another big hit to the Russian economy,\" he added.\n\nVenezuela holds some of the world's largest oil reserves. But analysts say reviving the country's oil industry could take years due to aging infrastructure, decades of under-investment, sanctions, and political instability.",

Lavrov also criticized Kyiv for launching the attack at a moment of intensive negotiations to end the war.\n\nThe allegation came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had traveled to Florida for talks with Trump on the U.S. administration's still-evolving 20-point plan aimed at ending the war. Zelenskyy quickly denied the Kremlin allegation.\n\nTrump said that “something happened nearby” Putin's residence but that Americans officials didn't find the Russian president's residence was targeted.\n\n“I don’t believe that strike happened,\" Trump told reporters as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his home in Florida. “We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.”\n\nTrump addressed the U.S. determination after European officials argued that the Russian claim was nothing more than an effort by Moscow to undermine the peace effort.\n\nBut Trump, at least initially, had appeared to take the Russian allegations at face value. He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.\n\nThe U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nBut Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian military leader on Putin’s hit-list conned the Kremlin out of $500,000 by faking his own death to collect the bounty, Kyiv revealed on Thursday.\n\nDenis Kapustin, a far-right military commander and founder of the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), a battalion of far-right Russians who fight for Ukraine against Putin, was reported to have been killed in a drone strike in Zaporizhia on December 27 after spending months atop the Kremlin’s most wanted list.\n\n“We will definitely avenge you, Denis,” the RVC wrote in a Telegram post ‘confirming’ Kapustin’s death. “Your legacy lives on.”\n\nBut in a stunning twist, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) revealed on Thursday that the assassination of Kapustin, 41, had instead been part of an elaborate hoax cooked up by Kyiv to save the militia leader’s life and trick Russia into paying them a half-a-million dollar bounty that had been placed on his head.\n\n“Welcome back to life,” HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov announced in a video on January 1, congratulating Kapustin on bamboozling the Kremlin.\n\n“First of all, Mr. Denis, congratulations on your return to life. That is always a pleasure. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle,” he said. “I wish us all and you personally success.”\n\nBudanov, who described Kapustin as a “personal enemy” of Vladimir Putin, said the plot had taken more than a month to organize and that the commander would promptly return to the frontlines to continue his duties after swindling the Kremlin out of its cash.\n\nKapustin, better known by his callsign of ‘White Rex,’ also confirmed his role in the plot and said his “temporary absence” had not affected his unit’s effectiveness on the battlefield.\n\n“I am ready to move to the area of operations and continue commanding the RDK,” he said.\n\nFormed in 2022, the RVC was one of several international brigades composed of dissident Russians who took up arms against Putin and played a key role in cross-border excursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Kursk regions in 2023 and 2024.\n\nBut Kapustin, who has been formally named a terrorist by the Russian government, has long been considered a controversial ally to Ukraine due to his association with several neo-Nazi and far-right groups, which saw him banned from entering almost the entire European Union, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain, in 2019 because of his extremist views.\n\nThe RVC describes its members as holding “conservative views and traditionalist beliefs” but has denied accusations of neo-Nazism, instead claiming their goal is to establish a “true nation-state for Russians” that “lives in peace with the nations that surround it.”\n\n“I have my set of views, it’s a patriotic set of views, it’s a traditionalist set of views, it’s a right-wing set of views,” Kapustin told Al Jazeera in 2023.\n\n“You’ll never find me waving a flag with a swastika, you’ll never find me raising my hand in a Hitler sign. So why would you call me that?”",

    "description": "The UK military expected to see more high-end Russian equipment, like T-14s and Su-57s, in Ukraine, an officer said. They're not there though.",
    "fullText": "A British Army officer said that the military was surprised it did not see more advanced Russian weaponry, like some of its best tanks, on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\n\"We probably would've expected to have seen more of their prestige equipment,\" Maj. Maguire told Business Insider, speaking on the condition that only his rank and last name be used. He previously helped lead the UK-led training for Ukrainian soldiers and also produced reports for the UK and allies on tactics in Ukraine and the lessons Western forces could draw from them.\n\nOne example he gave of Russian equipment that hasn't been seen is the T-14, considered Russia's most advanced tank.\n\nThat kind of warfighting equipment is what the British military sort of sees as \"the pacing threat equipment that we train against.\"\n\nThe T-14, estimated to cost between $5 million and $9 million, is regarded as one of Russia's best tanks. Western analysts had worried the tanks might rival NATO's most advanced tanks. Russian state media has often touted the Armata as \"cutting edge.\"\n\nYet these weapons haven't been seen in the war. Sergei Chemezov, the CEO of Rostec, which produces the Armata, previously said the tanks might not be well-suited for Ukraine.\n\n\"Armata is, in general, a little expensive,\" he said. \"In terms of functionality, it is, of course, much superior to existing tanks, but it is too expensive, so the army is unlikely to use it now.\"\n\nThe UK expected this kind of prestige equipment, but instead these tanks \"haven't really been used, and I think that's probably more surprising than the fact that they've used a lot of their stockpiles and stuff,\" Maguire said.\n\nThe Russians have relied heavily on tanks like T-90s and T-80s, as well as some decades-old equipment, some first deployed in the 1940s. It has been pulling old tanks out of storage rather than putting its most capable assets, at least on paper, out onto the battlefield.\n\nIts stores are vast, with numerous tanks built for a Cold War fight, and building new tanks is a long process, even with Russia's ramped-up defense industry output. Sophisticated machinery takes time to build, and the Western sanctions at crippling the industry don't make it any easier.\n\nMaguire did not speculate on why Russia is not using the T-14, but the UK Ministry of Defence has previously weighed in.\n\nIt said last year that the Armata's absence was \"highly likely due to the potential reputational damage of losing the 'prestige' vehicle in combat and the requirement to produce greater quantities of MBTs which can only be satisfied by other variants.\"\n\nAn earlier ministry intelligence update that Russian troops in Ukraine were reluctant to accept the first tranche of T-14s that were offered to them \"because the vehicles were in such poor condition.\"\n\nRussia's confidence in the tank is unclear; however, it notably reduced its own order for the tanks, instead focusing on modernizing older types. Western analyses say the tank is impressive but also appears to be more vulnerable than Russia has said.\n\nThe war has not been kind to tanks and other armored vehicles. It is a fight in which neither side has achieved air superiority and cheap drones and mines threaten anything that moves. Considering the substantial losses, cost-effective mass has often proven more valuable than exquisite combat power.\n\nBeyond the T-14, Russia also hasn't sent in its fifth-generation fighters, its Su-57s. These aircraft are built for this kind of war, where air defenses make the skies extremely dangerous for older fourth-gen jets. Russia hasn't made the progress it hoped for in Ukraine, yet these planes are still largely sitting out the fight.\n\nThe UK defense ministry said in 2023 that the Su-57's usage seemed limited to Russian territory and launching long-range air-to-surface or air-to-air missiles into Ukraine. It said Russia was \"highly likely prioritising avoiding the reputational damage, reduced export prospects, and the compromise of sensitive technology which would come from any loss\" of the jet over Ukraine.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the Su-57 stealth and combat capabilities, with some speculation that it may not be a true fifth-gen aircraft. A former UK air force officer turned analyst previously told Business Insider that Russia was likely saving them for a possible conflict with NATO.\n\nWhen it comes to the high-level equipment Russia isn't using, Maguire said, \"I have no idea why they're not using it, but I'm pretty sure whatever it is, we could defeat it with what we have.\"\n\nRussia has put some advanced systems into the war; however, the few weapons that have made an appearance haven't \"performed very well,\" the major said.\n\nHe pointed to Ukraine's destruction of Russia's newly developed BMPT \"Terminator\", a 23-foot-long armored vehicle carrying a host of weapons. Ukraine has also been able to shoot down the Kinzhal missiles Russia boasted were unstoppable with Patriots, and Russia's S-400 air defense system, while still formidable, has somewhat underperformed.\n\nRussia's military in general has underperformed compared to Western expectations, including in its failure to quickly overpower Ukraine, which has left it bogged down in a grinding fight in the east. NATO officials also say the quality of its military has degraded throughout the war, though others have noted its learning too, making it a threat the West is watching closely.",

    "description": "Drones have turned the front line into a kill zone, and made casualty evacuation extremely difficult and dangerous.",
    "fullText": "NATO forces would likely see heavier losses than Ukraine has in a war with Russia, a senior officer told Business Insider, and that possibility is driving a rethink of battlefield medical care.\n\nDrones are watching much of the front line, making it nearly impossible to get wounded troops access to medical care within the \"golden hour,\" the critical first 60 minutes after a severe injury when access to medical care may determine life or death.\n\nGolden hour is found only in books, said Ukrainian Col. Valerii Vyshnivskyi, the country's senior representative to the NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis Training and Education Centre (JATEC).\n\nNow, there's only a golden day or month, he continued. \"The battlefield is visible 100%. That's why medical evacuation cannot be done in the old way.\"\n\nThe sky above the battlefield is filled with drones of all types executing both reconnaissance and strike missions. That saturation means Ukrainians often have to wait for unfavorable weather conditions and poor visibility to evacuate casualties. Some solutions, such as ground robots, are becoming more popular, but those systems aren't without their problems. They are vulnerable to attack, they break down, and they are susceptible to jamming.\n\nIn a high-intensity conflict against Russia, NATO forces would probably face the same casualty evacuation issues that Ukraine is dealing with, Vyshnivskyi said. However, he believes the military alliance would suffer heavier combat losses, as such a war has the potential to be significantly more destructive.\n\nNow nearly four years into the war, neither Ukraine nor Russia has publicly disclosed how many of their soldiers have been killed or wounded in combat. However, the total losses across both sides are unquestionably high.\n\nUkraine has suffered an estimated 400,000 casualties, including up to 100,000 troops killed, according to figures reported over the summer. Russia's toll is even grimmer: the UK defense ministry said last month that Moscow has likely taken more than 1.1 million casualties since its 2022 invasion and is now losing over 1,000 troops a day.\n\nWestern leaders have warned that the carnage, while presently unfolding on the battlefield and in Ukrainian cities, could expand deeper into Europe.\n\n\"Russia could be ready to use military force against NATO within five years,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a speech last month, later adding that such a conflict would result in \"extreme losses.\"\n\nNATO is becoming increasingly aware of the threat that drones pose to the treatment and evacuation of wounded troops in armed conflict, and it is preparing to meet that challenge. The alliance is working to source solutions from the medical and defense industries to save lives on a drone-infested battlefield.\n\nCompanies from 20 nations submitted 175 applications to showcase solutions at an \"Innovation Challenge\" hosted by NATO Allied Command Transformation (ACT) and JATEC — a key initiative that uses real-time lessons from the war to inform Western defense planning — in London last month.\n\nTen finalists presented ideas, which included a portable system to treat kidney failure, a jury-rigged stretcher design for evacuation over rough terrain, a secure communications portal for medics, ballistic plates for makeshift shelter, and other innovative solutions.\n\nBritish Army Col. Niall Aye Maung, the medical branch head for NATO's ACT and the medical advisor to the alliance headquarters in Brussels, referred to the ideas as a \"system of systems,\" where there's no single solution for battlefield casualty treatment and medical care. Instead, they'd function together.\n\nACT officials are now examining how to overhaul the NATO medical system to meet the demands of a large-scale war, Maung told Business Insider — and they're turning to Ukraine's experience to find medical solutions, including through events like the innovation challenge.\n\nVyshnivskyi, the Ukrainian officer, said Western leaders and industry are starting to understand the challenges that Ukraine is dealing with on the battlefield.\n\nHowever, one of NATO's biggest problems, he said, is that building new capabilities takes far too long — much slower than the battlefield is changing.\n\nFor medical gear, the research and development process can be lengthy because items must undergo regulatory and legal processes to ensure their safety. Still, Maung said that most solutions NATO is looking for are commercial off-the-shelf products with dual-use applications in both civilian and military settings. This can speed up procurement timelines.\n\nQuicker procurement is something NATO is exploring well beyond medical capabilities, as allies look to keep pace with the evolution of war technology on the battlefield. Drones and other emerging technologies are at the center of these efforts.\n\n\"If we want to react and innovate at speed, we have to accept and respect that the speed of innovation in commercial markets and civilian markets is a lot faster than in traditional military markets, especially if you're looking at non-traditional armaments,\" Bart Hollants, NATO's innovation broker, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the Ukraine war continues, European militaries continue to buy up weapons and strengthen their defenses — especially nations along NATO's Eastern flank that border Russia — and prepare for the possibility of a larger war.\n\nRutte, NATO's secretary general, said during his speech last month that Europe needs \"to be ready\" because modern wars are \"no longer fought at arm's length.\"\n\n\"Conflict is at our door,\" he warned. \"Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured.\"",

A total of 31, including five minors, were hospitalized with injuries.\n\nA criminal probe on the charges of carrying out an act of terrorism has been opened, Petrenko said.\n\nKyiv denied attacking civilians. Spokesman of Ukraine’s General Staff, Dmytro Lykhovii, told Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne on Thursday that Ukrainian forces “adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law” and \"carry out strikes exclusively against Russian military targets, facilities of the Russian fuel and energy sector, and other lawful targets.”\n\nLykhovii said that General Staff has published an explicit list of targets that the Ukrainian army struck on the night of New Year’s Eve. The list did not include strikes on occupied parts of the Kherson region.\n\nLykhovii noted that Russia has repeatedly used disinformation and false statements to disrupt the ongoing peace negotiations.\n\nThe Associated Press could not independently verify claims made about the attack.\n\nRussia's accusations against Ukraine come amid a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Moscow alleged that Kyiv launched a long-range drone attack against a residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in northwestern Russia overnight from Sunday to Monday.\n\nKyiv has called the allegations of an attack on Putin’s residence a ruse to derail ongoing peace negotiations, which have ramped up in recent weeks on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nIn his New Year’s address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a peace deal was “90% ready” but warned that the remaining 10%, believed to include key sticking points such as territory, would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live.”\n\nTrump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that he, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner had a “productive call” with the national security advisers of Britain, France, Germany and Ukraine “to discuss advancing the next steps in the European peace process.”\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, Russia conducted what local authorities called “one of the most massive” drone attacks at Zaporizhzhia overnight.\n\nAt least nine Russian drones struck the city, damaging dozens of residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure, head of the regional administration, Ivan Fedorov, wrote on Telegram on Friday. There were no casualties, the official said.\n\nOverall, Russia fired 116 long-range drones at Ukraine last night, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said that 86 drones were intercepted, while 27 more have reached their targets.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry reported Friday that its air defenses intercepted 64 Ukrainian drones overnight over multiple Russian regions.\n\nVyacheslav Gladkov, governor of Russia's Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine, on Friday also accused Ukrainian forces of carrying out a missile strike on the city of Belgorod. Two women were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said. The strike shattered windows in multiple residential buildings and damaged an unspecified “commercial” facility and a number of cars, according to the official.",

    "description": "Kyiv deception operation pays off as Moscow intelligence fooled by assassination claims",
    "fullText": "As far as the Russians were concerned, they had got their man.\n\nDenis Kapustin, one of the most prominent anti-Putin Russians fighting on behalf of Ukraine, was reported dead on Dec 27, assassinated by a drone on the southern front.\n\nHe had long been hunted by Moscow and the price on his head reflected this: Russian intelligence services had offered $500,000 (£370,000) to anyone who killed him.\n\nRussia paid this out after news broke of the successful hit this week. But what Vladimir Putin’s intelligence services did not know was that they had handed the money directly to Ukraine.\n\nMr Kapustin, known by his nom de guerre “White Rex”, founded the pro-Ukrainian Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) in 2022.\n\nThe group made headlines in 2023 and 2024 when it carried out cross-border incursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Kursk regions, humiliating the Russian president and his generals.\n\nHis death was first confirmed by the RDK itself. “We will definitely take revenge, Denis,” the group said on Telegram. “Your legacy lives on.”\n\nYet on New Year’s Day, in a morale-raising ruse, Mr Kapustin re-emerged – alive and unscathed – in a video posted by Ukraine’s military intelligence (HUR).\n\n“Welcome back to life,” Gen Kyrylo Budanov, head of HUR, said with a wry smile. He congratulated Mr Kapustin and his team on a successful operation to deceive their Russian adversaries.\n\nIt turns out HUR, along with the RDK, had hatched a plan to fake Mr Kapustin’s death and claim the $500,000 bounty from Russia for themselves, to be used in Ukraine’s war effort.\n\n“First of all, Mr Denis, congratulations on your return to life. That is always a pleasure. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle,” Gen Budanov added.\n\nRussia’s FSB and GRU agencies have long been feared for their ruthlessness.\n\nBut Ukrainian intelligence, throughout the near four-year war, has consistently proved its ability to outsmart their Russian counterparts, carrying out assassinations of generals and Kremlin officials on Russian soil, orchestrating complex sabotage operations and recruiting Russian agents.\n\nIn November, it was reported that Ukraine’s intelligence services used Russia’s own agents to accept missions offered openly by the FSB for financial reward and sabotaging its objectives.\n\nIn one case, a Ukrainian double-agent accepted a task from a Russia jobs board to build a bomb, which was then handed to a Russian saboteur.\n\nThe bomb, however, was made using flour and the Russian agent was captured by Ukraine after it failed to detonate.\n\nUkraine has also claimed responsibility for assassinations of high-ranking Russian officials, while Kyiv is suspected to have been behind many others.\n\nIn April, Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy chief of the main operations directorate of Russia’s army, was killed by a car bomb on Nesterov Boulevard in the Balashikha suburb of Moscow.\n\nBaza, a Russian media outlet with sources inside law enforcement agencies, said the home-made bomb was strapped to a parked Volkswagen car and detonated remotely when Moskalik, who lived in the neighbourhood, walked past.\n\nA month later, a former Ukrainian politician was shot dead in what appeared to be a professional hit job at the entrance of an exclusive school in Madrid.\n\nAndriy Portnov, a pro-Russian politician who worked as a close aide to the Moscow regime, was dropping off his daughters when an assassin shot him several times.\n\nThe shooting took place at the American School of Madrid while other parents were also making the school run.\n\nMost recently, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, 56, head ‍of the Russian army’s operational training ‍directorate, died in an explosion on Dec 22 in Moscow, probably planted by Ukrainian special forces.\n\nThe force of the explosion was such that at least seven cars parked nearby also sustained damage\n\nThe general worked in the Russian ministry of defence and participated in combat operations in Chechnya, Syria and Ossetia as well as Ukraine.\n\nAmong the most striking assassinations was the killing of Lt Gen Igor Kirillov on Dec 17 2024.\n\nThe officer, who was in charge of Russia’s nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, was killed by a remotely detonated device hidden inside an electric scooter.\n\n“Kirillov was a war criminal and an absolutely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against the Ukrainian military,” a Ukrainian security source said.\n\nIn a daring mission in June 2025 – dubbed Operation Spiderweb – Ukraine-operated drones destroyed several Russian surveillance aircraft and nuclear-capable bombers, with officials in Kyiv saying this rendered a third of Russia’s strategic cruise missile carriers useless.\n\nThe drones had been smuggled into Russia and assembled, and launched from trucks deep within Russian territory, in another huge victory for Ukraine’s spies.\n\nUkraine’s latest intelligence success means Denis Kapustin, a far-Right extremist and former football hooligan, is inside Ukrainian territory and “preparing to continue carrying out assigned tasks”, said a Ukrainian commander.\n\nThe commander’s family moved from Moscow to Germany when Mr Kapustin was 17 and he relocated to Ukraine in 2017.\n\nSince 2019, he has been banned from entering the Schengen Area for promoting neo-Nazi ideology.\n\nIn the early weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Mr Kapustin helped set up units that would become Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade that played a key role in defending Kyiv and later become renowned for its fierce fighting on the eastern front.\n\nResponding to reports of his death, the 3rd Army Corps said: “We together confronted the common enemy in the battle for Kyiv.”\n\nIt added on Dec 27: “He perceived [Ukraine] as a place of real resistance and freedom.”\n\nIn August 2022, Mr Kapustin set up the RDK, with the goal of overthrowing Putin to bring “peace to Russia”. Its stated aim is to end Putin’s regime of “lies, corruption, and lawlessness”.\n\nIt is made up of former Wagner Group recruits, some former FSB agents and civilian volunteers. It is deemed a terrorist organisation by Russia.\n\nRussian courts have twice sentenced Mr Kapustin to life imprisonment in absentia on treason and terrorism charges.\n\nIn March 2024, the RDK stormed into Russia alongside other anti-Kremlin militias on tanks and armoured vehicles. It clashed with Russian security services and captured Russian soldiers.\n\nKyiv has said that while it fights as part of Ukraine’s military, under its command, the incursions into Russia were not taking place under Kyiv’s orders.\n\nSince its incursions, the group is either fighting at the front or engaged in cross-border sabotage operations in Russia.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph in September, an RDK commander known as “White”, a 26-year-old Russian volunteer, described how he joined in order to exact revenge on Putin for invading Ukraine.\n\n“We fight to change something in Russia,” he said. “When the war ends, I will continue fighting until Putin falls.”",

    "description": "A New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.",
    "fullText": "United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addresses a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025 \n\nA New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart during which he seemed much more concerned with his appearance than policy.\n\nThe Times published a comprehensive story about the Trump administration’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday in which it suggested that Hegseth began his tenure at the Pentagon “as something of a blank slate on the war.”\n\n“He didn’t have any of his own thoughts on Russia and Ukraine,” an ex-Pentagon official told the Gray Lady. “But he had civilian advisers who did.”\n\nOn Day 4, the freshly minted defense secretary sat at a Pentagon conference table as one of his coterie of advisers argued for an immediate U-turn.\n\nThe ideological godfather of the group was Elbridge A. Colby, grandson of the Nixon-era C.I.A. director William E. Colby. The younger Mr. Colby and Mr. Vance had been introduced in 2015 by an editor at National Review who thought they were like-minded. Nearly nine years later, as Mr. Biden poured billions of dollars into arming Ukraine, Mr. Colby argued that “we would have been better served to put a lot more of that money to use in the Pacific.”\n\nNow, it was one of his disciples, Dan Caldwell, presenting the group’s recommendations to Mr. Hegseth, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other military leaders.\n\nThe Pentagon, Mr. Caldwell argued, should pause delivery of certain munitions that the Biden administration had promised to Ukraine, because, he believed, existing stocks were insufficient to execute America’s war plans around the world. Nor should it use the additional $3.8 billion left unspent by the Biden administration to buy weapons for Ukraine.\n\nGeneral Brown did not speak as Mr. Caldwell wrapped up. He simply shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\n\nDuring a trip to Europe the next month, Hegseth reportedly made sure to powder his nose for the cameras, but declined to answer Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov’s queries:\n\nThe Ukrainians had repeatedly requested a proper sit-down. Instead it would be a brief stand-up affair in an anteroom.\n\nBeforehand, according to an American official present, Mr. Hegseth dabbed his nose with powder from a small compact. “Look commanding,” he told one aide. The handshake with the Ukrainian might be shown on Fox; the president might be watching.\n\nThen the standing meeting began, Mr. Umerov coming in close, taking his voice down to a whisper, assuring the secretary that he knew America’s political and security agenda might be changing. He didn’t ask for new aid. He just needed to know one thing: Would the U.S. military continue to supply the munitions Ukraine was counting on, the ones approved by Mr. Biden? Every delivery sustained the lives of Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines; every delivery that didn’t arrive one day meant those soldiers would die the next.\n\nAgain and again, Mr. Umerov repeated his plea: “I just need you to be honest with me. Just be honest with me.”\n\nHegseth allegedly offered Umerov only nodding.\n\n“He wasn’t pleading for the answer that he wanted, but just for honesty, some indication,” observed one U.S. official. “He was saying: You can trust me; you can trust us. Just tell me what you guys are thinking.”\n\nThe post New York Times Deep Dive Alleges Pete Hegseth Donned Makeup for Ukraine Photo Op — Then Ignored Counterpart first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Russia is using helicopters to try to stop Ukraine's drones. Now its naval drones armed with missiles keep Russia's helicopters away, per a commander.",
    "fullText": "Russian helicopters are now steering clear of Ukraine's naval drones because they are vulnerable to the surface-to-air missiles some carry, a Ukrainian special forces commander said.\n\nThe commander, call sign Thirteen, leads \"Group 13,\" a special forces unit within Ukraine's defense intelligence agency, the GUR, that uses naval drones. He said that Russian helicopters initially \"posed a critical threat and made our work difficult.\"\n\nHowever, the naval drones evolved to counter the aircraft. Specifically, Ukraine armed them with missiles.\n\n\"After that, the enemy stopped using helicopters against us altogether, realising they had become easy targets for our missiles,\" Thirteen said. He spoke earlier this month at a GUR showcase about Ukraine's naval drones, and his comments were reported by Ukrainian outlet Pravda.\n\nThe commander did not specify when this change occurred, but his update indicates an increasingly successful role for Ukraine's pioneering naval drones. The drones achieved tremendous wins against Russian warships, forcing Russia to relocate its naval vessels and increase combat air patrols. Now, it appears the new missile-armed naval drones are seeing success in driving away the air patrols.\n\nUkraine claimed its first naval drone kill of a Russian helicopter last December, calling it a first worldwide. It said a Magura V5 sea drone destroyed a Russian Mi-8 helicopter with missiles. Ukraine has since claimed more helicopter hits with its naval drones.\n\nThe usefulness of helicopters has shifted throughout the war. Russia saw its Ka-52 attack helicopters defeat Ukrainian armor but also suffered losses to air defenses, the proliferation of which has made it extremely difficult for either side to take control of the skies.\n\nRussian helicopters, much like Ukraine's, have broadly been vulnerable to interceptors and drones, both aerial first-person-view (FPV) drones and now naval drones. They're increasingly employed with caution but still used for troop transport, logistical support, evacuations, armed support, air assault missions, and drone hunts.\n\nUkraine, for instance, has new helicopter units dedicated to shooting down Russian drones. Notably, though, they're engaging Shahed-style long-range one-way attack drones that Russia uses to attack cities, not front-line attack drones.\n\nThe naval drones' ability to shoot down helicopters reflects how rapidly the systems have evolved to hit a wider range of targets. Early in the war, the drones were used mainly as explosive-laden attack craft, ramming Russian warships and other vessels.\n\nAlong with aerial drones, they helped Ukraine blunt Russia's naval power despite Ukraine lacking a traditional navy, including by forcing much of Russia's Black Sea Fleet to withdraw to ports farther from Ukraine. The fleet used to be based in Sevastopol but is now positioned primarily at Novorossiysk.\n\nOver time, Ukraine has expanded the drones' capabilities by adding missile and rocket launchers, guns, and even other drones that can be launched from the vessels. New variants and missions have followed, including drones that have downed Russian fighter jets and others designed specifically to strike Russian assets on rivers.\n\nUkraine makes its own sea drones, including Magura variants and the Sea Baby. Russia has also gotten into the naval drone business, and the West is increasingly paying attention to the impact that the assets can have in war.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump struggled to offer much sympathy for the families of about 100 Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nAn estimated several thousand Americans have volunteered to fight for Ukraine since Russian dictator Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, with at least 92 Americans killed as of September, The New York Times reported.\n\nFollowing a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a peace deal to end the war, Trump was asked about his message to the families of the fallen Americans.\n\n“The message is so obvious,” he replied. “What a shame. They died in a foreign country. And some are celebrated people, they’re very celebrated. But it’s so sad that a thing like that would happen.”\n\nHe then immediately moved on to the next question.\n\nSocial media users quickly noted that the president hadn’t thanked the fallen for their sacrifice, praised their commitment to freedom and democracy, or even offered his personal condolences.\n\nMany of the Americans who have died in Ukraine were U.S. military veterans.\n\nMike Meoli, 71, was a retired Navy Seal and firefighter who traveled to Ukraine to train medics on the front lines. He was killed in November 2024, ABC 10 News San Diego reported.\n\nNicholas Maimer, 45, was an Army Special Forces veteran and Idaho native who helped train Ukrainian officers. He was killed in May 2023 in an artillery barrage, according to Military.com.\n\nIan Frank Tortorici, 32, was a retired corporal with the U.S. Marines who fought on the front lines. He died in July 2023 after a Russian missile hit a restaurant where he was eating while on leave, Task and Purpose reported.\n\nThe U.S. government has declined to provide aid to American fighters to avoid any suggestion of a direct clash with Russia, which is a nuclear power, the Times reported in September.\n\nBut some social media users argued that Trump’s barely-there compassion for their families wasn’t measured diplomacy—it was reminiscent of the president’s previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during World War I were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.\n\nAlthough he failed to offer much comfort Sunday to the families of Americans who have died fighting Russia, Trump did manage to heap praise on the man who started the war.\n\n“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, prompting Zelensky to raise an eyebrow. “I was explaining to the president [Zelensky], President Putin was very generous in his feeling toward Ukraine succeeding.”\n\nHe also said he “understands” Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire while a longer-term agreement is being hashed out.\n\n“He feels that look, you know, they’re fighting and to stop, and if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn’t want to be in that position—I understand that position,” Trump said.\n\nPutin bombarded Ukraine with over 100 drones on Christmas Eve and early Christmas Day, killing at least seven civilians.\n\nSunday’s talks were intended to address security guarantees and possible territorial concessions, and while both sides said progress had been made, neither gave any indication that a deal was within reach.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States is offering Ukraine security guarantees for a period of 15 years as part of a proposed peace plan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, though he said he would prefer an American commitment of up to 50 years to deter Russia from further attempts to seize its neighbor’s land by force.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump hosted Zelenskyy at his Florida resort on Sunday and insisted that Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace settlement.\n\nNegotiators are still searching for a breakthrough on key issues, however, including whose forces withdraw from where and the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the 10 biggest in the world. Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.\n\n“Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,” Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.\n\nUkraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDetails of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the “presence” of partners. He didn’t elaborate, but Russia has said it won’t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv’s allies will meet in Paris in early January to “finalize each country’s concrete contributions” to the security guarantees.\n\nTrump said he would consider extending U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.\n\nHowever, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump slathered a fresh coat of makeup on his hand for another round of peace talks with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\nTrump, 79, welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to his Mar-a-Lago estate as he continues to chase down an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which he promised to end on his first day back in office.\n\nThe mismatched concealer on Trump’s hand was once again evident as he took questions from reporters.\n\nJust days ago, on Christmas Eve, the now-familiar bruising on Trump’s right hand was coupled with some discoloration on his left. On Sunday, however, his left hand seemed back to normal, while his right hand remained covered in makeup.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reverted to a statement she has been reusing since February when reached for comment by the Daily Beast.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” she said.\n\nLeavitt previously attributed the persistent bruising to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has closely catalogued the bruising on Trump’s hand, which he has been nursing for months. The makeup smears, together with Trump’s swollen ankles, mysterious MRI, mental flubs, and twice-in-a-year “annual” medical checkups, have raised concerns about the health of the oldest person to be inaugurated president.\n\nThe White House has consistently maintained that Trump is in “excellent health.”\n\nThe president was joined by several of his officials in Mar-a-Lago as he sat down for another meeting with Zelensky, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nA day before the meeting, Russia struck Kyiv with ballistic missiles and drones, killing at least one person and injuring 27 others.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump said he still believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was “very serious” about finding common ground with Ukraine.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, that’s good for everybody. There’s nothing more important,” he told reporters. “I’ve settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one. I thought it would be in the middle of the pack. This is the most difficult one, but we’re gonna get it done.”\n\nThe president stopped short of laying out a timeline for the end of peace talks.\n\n“I don’t have deadlines,” he said. “You know what my deadline is? Getting the war ended.”",

    "description": "A US Navy special operations veteran told BI that ground robots are helpful, but it's best to have more cheap one than fewer expensive ones.",
    "fullText": "With drones always buzzing overhead, ready to dive bomb soldiers or relay targeting data to an artillery gun crew, it can be far too dangerous to send a human being to rescue the wounded, so Ukraine is turning to robots to evacuate injured troops.\n\nA US veteran in Ukraine who saw them in action told Business Insider they're effective — and said Ukraine is right to keep them simple and cheap, given that many may not make it back.\n\nUkraine is using a growing number of ground robots, a kind of drone, to combat Russia's invasion by carrying supplies, acting as bombs, and evacuating injured soldiers.\n\nMany of these systems come from Ukrainian companies and manufacturers located within Ukraine's European partners. It's technology that militaries are increasingly paying attention to, seeing it as a solution that could save lives on the modern battlefield, though across NATO and Western forces, the focus is mainly on doctrine, testing, and prototyping.\n\nEven in Ukraine, uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) only make up a small fraction of the drones in use in battle.\n\nJeffrey Wells, a US Navy veteran with experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, is now helping out a nonprofit in Ukraine. He told Business Insider that using ground robots for casualty evacuation isn't perfect, but it's useful. He said that the West should take note but avoid overengineering or overspending on these kinds of systems.\n\nThe robots are \"not always a success, but at least it's something,\" he said.\n\nThe casualty evacuation robots function like remote-controlled stretchers, but rescuing wounded troops is far from foolproof: with so many drones overhead, they're easy to spot — and just as easy to attack.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have pointed to the limits of ground robots in evacuating the wounded, noting that while they can be a lifeline for a wounded soldier when it is too unsafe for their comrades to come get them, they can be jammed, they break down, and they can be targeted just like anything else moving in battle.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, head of robotic systems for the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that they are a last resort tool because a wounded soldier could wind up in \"an even worse situation.\"\n\nThey are a \"last hope kind of thing,\" Wells explained. \"And that shouldn't cost a lot of money and should be something that's easily developed, replaced, and deployed.\"\n\nWells' work in Ukraine aims to help civilians survive the war. He is there with Task Force Antal, a nonprofit organization run by US veterans that provides medical training, supplies, and evacuation support to civilians, especially in front-line areas.\n\nHe said that the evacuation robots don't need to be flawless technology — the tech is evolving so fast that whatever works today may well be redesigned next week anyway. What matters, he said, is getting something usable into the field now, because saving lives outranks engineering elegance.\n\nWells said the robot he saw in action was \"low tech\" but got the job done, explaining that he would rather have 10 robots worth $1,000 than one that was more advanced and worth $100,000.\n\n\"You kind of just need something that's effective, essentially a stretcher with wheels that gives hope to the person that's injured.\" It doesn't need to be more complicated than that.\n\nIn talks with Business Insider, Ukrainian soldiers, foreign volunteers, and arms makers have emphasized key lessons for the West: prioritize more cheap systems over a few exquisite ones, don’t pour money into technology that may quickly become obsolete, and resist the urge to overengineer and overspend on gear meant for a battlefield that changes every week.\n\nWhen it comes to robots for evacuation, Wells said that the best thing is to keep technology cheap and expendable so troops don't think they \"have to use this because it costs so much money.\"",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Several key issues remain unresolved in ongoing negotiations between Ukraine and the United States over a potential framework to end Russia’s war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week. Speaking about a 20-point plan under discussion, Zelenskyy outlined the most difficult points, noting that Ukraine has already conveyed its position to Washington, which is expected to communicate it to Moscow.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that the Kremlin had already been in contact with U.S. representatives since Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev recently met with U.S. envoys in Florida. However, he did not reveal any details, saying only: “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue.”\n\nZelenskyy said talks continue over the nature and scope of security guarantees that would be provided to Ukraine under any agreement. He said several technical issues remain, including how guarantees would be enforced and what monitoring mechanisms would be used to ensure compliance.\n\nZelenskyy said the fate of the territories that Russia claims remain the most difficult issue in the talks. He did not provide details, but has repeatedly said Kyiv will not recognize Russian control over occupied regions, including areas seized since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Zelenskyy has also repeatedly stated Ukraine will not cede territories it currently controls, which Russia has publicly demanded.\n\nZaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\n\nZelenskyy said the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains unresolved. The facility, Europe’s largest, has been under Russian control since early on in the war and has raised repeated international safety concerns due to fighting nearby.\n\nUkraine has been consistent in saying that safe operation of the station requires demilitarization of its territory, where Russia currently has troops stationed. Apart from that, Ukraine has been insisting that Ukrainian workers should be granted full access to the station, which they currently don’t have.\n\nDetails previously released in the course of the current negotiations revealed that the U.S. and Ukrainian teams are in discussion of a joint-access format, potentially between all three sides (the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia).\n\nZelenskyy said further discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. teams are expected, including talks in Florida, and that separate documents on economic recovery and prosperity are also under consideration.",

    "fullText": "Republican senators have joined Democrats to issue a pointed message to Donald Trump as he prepares to meet with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nZelensky, 47, will travel to Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a possible peace agreement to end Russia’s war in Ukraine with Trump, 79, who previously tried to bully Ukraine into accepting a U.S.-brokered deal favorable to Vladimir Putin.\n\nAfter Putin, 73, hit Ukraine with hundreds of drones and missiles over Christmas, GOP senators Thom Tillis, Jerry Moran, and John Barrasso, along with Democratic colleagues, offered a reminder that Putin, 73, is a “ruthless murderer.”\n\n“Today’s decision by Putin to launch attacks rather than hold fire is a sobering reminder for us all: Putin is a ruthless murderer who has no interest in peace and cannot be trusted,” reads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee release.\n\nThe senators added, “It bears repeating that President Zelenskyy agreed to a Christmas truce, but Putin declined, yet he directs soldiers to continue to commit brutal crimes of aggression on one of Christianity’s holiest days.”\n\nTillis, 65, a senator from North Carolina, Moran, 71, a senator from Kansas, and Barrasso, 73, a senator from Wyoming, were joined by Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, Jacky Rosen, Chris Coons, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nThe message was not joined by more MAGA-friendly members of the committee, including its Republican chairman Jim Risch and Texas’ Ted Cruz.\n\nOnce firmly in control of congressional Republicans, Trump’s influence has weakened in recent months as his approval rating has plummeted and the GOP has lost in contests across the country.\n\nThe defeats suggest a path for Democrats to reclaim at least partial control of Congress in the 2026 midterms by flipping the House and even the Senate, leaving Trump to serve the remainder of his second term as a lame-duck president.\n\nMoreover, the trio of Republican senators is largely free from electoral pressure: Tillis is retiring in 2027, Moran faces reelection in 2028, and Barrasso in 2030.\n\nCritics have long accused Trump of playing into Putin’s hands while being hostile towards Ukraine and other traditional allies.\n\nIn recent months, he launched a diplomatic push to end the war, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, but his proposed peace plan initially reflected many of Putin’s demands, blindsiding Zelensky and European allies.\n\nThe demands included limitations on Ukraine’s military and, crucially, the surrender of territory to Russia.\n\nLast month, Trump melted down at Ukraine on Truth Social, claiming that Zelensky had shown “ZERO GRATITUDE” in a message echoing his tantrum at their contentious Oval Office meeting in February. Zelensky responded by thanking Trump again.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader announced Thursday that he’d had a “good conversation” with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nHe told reporters Friday that he plans to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine with Trump on Sunday, as well as the “sensitive issue” of possible territorial concessions.\n\nWhile Zelesnky said the 20-point plan under discussion “is about 90% ready,” he cautioned, “Russia constantly looks for reasons not to agree.”",

    "description": "Western militaries are looking at interceptor drones — proven in combat in Ukraine — as an ideal low-cost air defense.",
    "fullText": "NATO militaries are looking for cheaper ways to defeat hostile drones without having to expend vastly more expensive missiles. The answer, it seems, is in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian forces are using domestically produced interceptor drones daily to bring down deadly Russian drones, with units regularly sharing footage of the high-speed aerial chases.\n\nThe interceptor drones can be mass-produced, which is crucial for Ukraine as worsening Russian bombardments that sometimes include hundreds of drones and missiles in a single night put stress on the country's deeply strained air defense network.\n\nNATO is taking note, with officials identifying interceptor drones not just as a cheap way to fill a capability gap — air defense against relatively inexpensive attack drones — but also as an early indication of where warfare is going. Some allied countries are developing systems, while others are rushing to buy them at scale.\n\n\"Technology is evolving really, really rapidly,\" British Army Brig. Gen. Chris Gent, the deputy chief of staff for transformation and integration at NATO Allied Land Command, said at a recent training event in Poland. \"It's a race to keep up.\"\n\nInterceptor drones emerged this year as a priority defense investment for Ukraine as it looks for ways to stay ahead of Russia's growing drone production and worsening nightly attacks without totally depleting its surface-to-air missile stocks or breaking the bank to take out cheap yet inexpensive threats.\n\nUkraine's defense industry produces hundreds of interceptor drones each day, some of which cost as little as $2,500. That's a fraction of the cost of a standard Russian one-way attack drone, estimated to be worth $35,000 on the low end. They can carry small warheads and are designed to directly strike their targets midair or explode nearby for a proximity kill.\n\nThe interceptor drones have provided Kyiv with a significant increase in air defense options. They can reach higher and faster-moving targets than the truck-mounted machine guns that Ukrainian soldiers had long relied on to shoot down low-flying Russian airborne targets, and they allow the country to hold its critical surface-to-air missiles in reserve for higher-end threats.\n\nSeeing how effective interceptor drones have been, NATO is now racing to develop and field its own. That push took on new urgency in September after Russian drones strayed into Polish and Romanian airspace, prompting Western forces to scramble fighter jets.\n\nThe incursions — and NATO's scramble to respond — raised questions about how the alliance should handle cheap drones, and whether it's sustainable to launch fighter jets armed with expensive missiles for every airspace violation.\n\nWhile NATO is still flying fighter patrols, Poland and Romania have purchased and are deploying the American-made Merops system, which consists of an interceptor drone that has already taken down more than 1,900 Russian targets for Ukraine.\n\nIn late November, Business Insider observed Polish, Romanian, and American forces training on the Merops system. Military officials touted the system's success in combat and its ability to provide NATO with a cheap air defense for its Eastern flank. (The interceptor drone costs $15,000, still less than the potential threats.)\n\nAt that training event, US Army Brig. Gen. Curtis King, the head of the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, said that NATO needs to \"learn from what Ukraine is fighting right now.\"\n\nHe said that in addition to Poland, Romania, and the US, other NATO allies are experimenting with similar systems, the aim being to employ this technology across the alliance.\n\nAnd Western countries are linking up with the Ukrainians on this technology as well. In September, for instance, the UK announced plans to mass-produce thousands of Ukrainian-designed interceptor drones for Kyiv. The US is also making these weapons in collaboration with Ukraine.\n\nThe general said that getting Western firms to produce more interceptor drones will help drive the cost down even further for NATO countries interested in acquiring this technology.\n\nThe value is clear, King said. Procuring interceptor drones would allow NATO countries to save sophisticated air defenses, such as the MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile system or certain air-to-air missiles, for threats like cruise and ballistic missiles, rather than one-way attack drones.\n\nInterceptor drones are among the newer innovations emerging from the war as Ukraine and Russia attempt to secure a technological advantage, with each new capability fielded pushing the other side to develop a countermeasure.\n\nAt the Merops training in Poland, Western officials said they are watching Ukraine and Russia race through cycles of weapons innovation at a pace that demands faster procurement before new tools become obsolete.\n\n\"The life cycle of technology has shortened dramatically,\" said Bart Hollants, NATO's innovation broker.\n\n\"It's not a new trend, but we see it on the battlefield in Ukraine,\" he told Business Insider, explaining that \"every six weeks to three months, there is a new iteration or a new version of tech that enters the front line, and that you have to defend yourself against, or that you have to create countermeasures for.\"\n\nWith that pacing in mind, NATO has turned to Western and Ukrainian defense firms for new ways to counter the war's biggest threats, giving these companies chances to pitch, test, and market systems as combat-ready.\n\nEarlier this year, NATO hosted an \"Innovation Challenge\" that brought in companies to present solutions for Russian glide bombs and one-way attack drones. Two firms — one French and the other German — won first and second place, respectively, for their solutions, made up of interceptor drones.\n\nFrench Cdr. Pierre Delom, a project coordinator at NATO's Allied Command Transformation who leads the Innovation Challenges, said that the alliance could find itself at war at any moment and needed to be ready.\n\nThe key, he told Business Insider, is the mass production of affordable air defenses so that NATO doesn't have to spend any more money to counter low-cost threats than necessary. In a future fight, these threats may be out in force, and the alliance can't afford to pour expensive missiles into that fight. Sustainability is about making every dollar count.",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — On a Christmas Day when the war in Ukraine casts a shadow over Europe, concerns over immigration divide societies, and some politicians fan anger and resentment, Britain’s King Charles III called on people to focus on kindness instead of conflict.\n\nDelivering his annual holiday address from Westminster Abbey, Charles said Thursday the Christmas story of wise men and shepherds traveling through the night to find their savior shows how we can find strength in the “companionship and kindness of others.”\n\n“To this day, in times of uncertainty, these ways of living are treasured by all the great faiths and provide us with deep wells of hope, of resilience in the face of adversity,” Charles said. “Peace through forgiveness, simply getting to know our neighbors and by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships.”\n\n“In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong,” he added.\n\nThe speech, which concluded with a Christmas carol sung by a Ukrainian choir, comes as European leaders rally support for Ukraine amid signs that U.S. President Donald Trump is losing patience with America’s traditional European allies. At home, British politics have become increasingly bitter as Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government struggles to control unauthorized migration and bolster creaking public services.\n\nCharles, the titular head of the Church of England, chose Westminster Abbey as the site of his Christmas Day broadcast to underscore the theme of pilgrimage that ran through the speech. The abbey, known as the site of coronations and royal weddings, is also the focus of an annual pilgrimage honoring Edward the Confessor, an early king of England who was canonized as a saint in 1161.\n\n“Pilgrimage is a word less used today, but it is of particular significance for our modern world, and especially at Christmas,’’ he said. “This is about journeying forward into the future, while also journeying back to remember the past and learn from its lessons.”\n\nCharles and his family made their own pilgrimage on foot earlier in the day to St. Mary Magdalene Church on the king’s private Sandringham Estate, about 100 miles north of London.\n\nCharles and Queen Camilla, along with Prince William and his wife, Kate, and their children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, and extended family walked to the church and greeted the crowds of people after the service.\n\nEvents earlier this year marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II underscored the need to learn from the past, Charles said. While there are fewer and fewer living veterans of that conflict, we must remember the courage and sacrifice of those who fought the war and the way communities came together “in the face of such great challenge,” he said.\n\n“These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth,” he said. “As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.’’\n\nThe monarch’s annual holiday message is watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent nations, most of which have historic ties to Britain. The pre-recorded speech is broadcast at 3 p.m. London time, when many families are enjoying their traditional Christmas lunch.\n\nThe speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, is able to voice his own views and doesn’t seek guidance from the government.\n\nThis year’s address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said “good news” from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.\n\nThe king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a “precautionary phase” and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.\n\nThe speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, from the king to his grandchildren, George and Louis and Charlotte, meeting with the public and carrying out their royal duties.\n\nThat included scenes from the king’s historic trip to the Vatican as he works to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe event was the first time since King Henry VIII severed ties with Rome that the leaders of the two Christian churches, divided for centuries over issues that now include the ordination of female priests in the Church of England, have prayed together.\n\nThe king’s message was clear. Even if some years had passed, there’s always hope to start over. Peace is possible.",

    "fullText": "The majority of Russians expect the war with Ukraine to end in 2026, according to a poll released Wednesday.\n\nThe survey of 1,600 Russians aged 18 and above found that 55% believe what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" is nearing its end. The poll was conducted in mid-December by the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center.\n\nMikhail Mamonov, the deputy head of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, said as he presented the results at a roundtable discussion: \"The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president.\"\n\nIn previous years, when revealing the results of its annual poll, the organization did not provide data on the share of Russians expecting the war to end. It is hard to assess public sentiment about sensitive subjects like the war in Russia due to the country's tightly controlled public discourse.\n\nThe result came as Russia's economic boom, driven by wartime spending and subsidies, cooled.\n\nIn November, Russia's industrial output fell 0.7% from a year ago, following a 3.1% increase in October, Rosstat, Russia's official statistics agency, said Wednesday. Reuters reported that day that analysts expected a 1.2% increase in output.\n\nThe profits of Russian companies declined nearly 10% to 21.6 trillion rubles, or $273.4 billion, from January through October.\n\nHigh — but moderating — inflation, weaker energy revenues, a strong ruble, and tight credit have weighed on consumer demand and real incomes, squeezing private-sector activity.\n\nA separate, independent poll of 1,608 Russians aged 18 and above showed that the economy and the war with Ukraine were their top concerns. The survey conducted between November 18 and 27 by the Levada Center was published December 16.\n\nIn a tightly choreographed phone-in event Friday with ordinary Russian citizens and journalists, known as the \"Direct Line,\" Putin acknowledged a sharp slowdown in economic growth — to 1% this year from 4.3% in 2024. He attributed it to government measures aimed at improving inflation.\n\nWhile Ukraine dominated the discussion, the broadcast was punctuated by flashes of public frustration, as text messages from viewers were displayed on a large screen in the hall, Reuters reported.\n\nThere were complaints about internet outages, poor water quality, and the rising cost of living — a reminder of how economic pressures affect the lives of Russians.",

    "fullText": "The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it disabled a Russian surveillance plane at an airfield before launching its claimed drone strike on a Kilo-class submarine.\n\nThe SBU last week released footage of what it claimed to be a hit on a Kilo-class submarine in the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk using a Sub Sea Baby underwater drone.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, the agency published a new video of what it said was an aerial drone strike on an Il-38N anti-submarine aircraft at the Yeysk air base in Russia’s southern Krasnodar Krai region.\n\nThe Il-38N would have be used to wipe out Ukrainian sea drones to protect Russian vessels.\n\nThe SBU said: “This aircraft is designed for maritime reconnaissance, search for submarines, control of water areas, and laying minefields and launching torpedo strikes.\n\n“The disabled aircraft actively interfered with the operation of the SBU’s marine drones.”\n\nThe footage shared by the SBU showed a generic image of an Il-38N in flight before cutting to satellite imagery of the aircraft sitting on the tarmac at Yeysk.\n\nThe video then shows what appears to be the feed from a Ukrainian first-person view drone hovering over a similar-looking aircraft.\n\nThe Telegraph could not independently confirm the SBU’s claimed strikes.\n\nAccording to the SBU, Russia had one operational Il-38N, valued at roughly $24m (£18m). It said the agency’s strike on the anti-submarine plane was crucial to attacking the Russian sub in Novorossiysk.\n\nLast week’s footage showed the Kilo-class 636.3 Varshavyanka being engulfed in an explosion while docked at Russia’s southern naval hub. The SBU said it has been “put out of action”.\n\nKilo-class submarines cost about $400m (£296m). The one said to have been hit last week is likely to have been armed with Kalibr cruise missiles, which Moscow has used in long-range strikes.\n\nThe attack, which was the first of its kind, was seen as important symbolically because it took place at Novorossiysk, a naval hub that has taken on greater strategic importance for Russia’s Black Sea Fleet after it was forced to relocate there.\n\nUkraine had driven the naval fleet from its original home port in Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea with a series of marine drone strikes.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "An explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away.\n\nAn official from Ukraine’s military intelligence, known as GUR, told The Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia’s war in Ukraine, without providing details. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nRussian authorities did not comment on who may be behind the attack. Since Moscow invaded nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Kyiv for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them.\n\nOn Wednesday, two traffic police officers were approaching a suspicious individual when a device detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement. The officers and another person standing nearby died from their injuries.\n\nThe Interior Ministry named the officers as Lt. Ilya Klimanov, 24, who joined the Moscow police in October 2023, and Lt. Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Gorbunov had a wife and a 9-month-old daughter, the statement said.\n\nThe blast took place in the same area of the Russian capital where Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday. Sarvarov was the head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff.\n\nInvestigators have said they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind that attack, which was the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. Ukraine has not commented on it.\n\nUkraine — which is outnumbered by Russia’s larger, better equipped military — has frequently tried to change the course of the war by attacking in unexpected ways.\n\nIn August last year, Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region even as they struggled to stem Russian offensives elsewhere. Moscow’s troops eventually drove them out, but the incursion diverted Russian military resources and raised Ukrainian morale.\n\nIn June, swarms of drones launched from trucks targeted bomber bases across Russia.\n\nMoscow has also blamed assassinations on Ukraine. Just over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov’s assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nDays after Moskalik’s killing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes” although he didn’t mention Moskalik’s name.\n\nMeanwhile, Western officials have accused Russia of staging a campaign of disruption and sabotage across Europe as part of an effort to sap support for Ukraine. Moscow has denied the claims.",

    "description": "Ukraine uses ground robots to fire at Russian targets and attack positions while its own soldiers stay at a safer distance.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's military has approved a ground robot adapted for some of the country's most vital grenade launchers, the robot's manufacturer said.\n\nThe autonomous vehicles, also called ground drones or unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), are playing a growing role in Ukraine, helping its military with one of its biggest disadvantages: its much smaller military.\n\nThe robots are used for a host of functions, including firing at Russian targets, blowing up Russian positions, and evacuating the wounded.\n\nBut the company, DevDroid, said this was the first time Ukraine has given this level of authorization to one adapted for these key launchers.\n\nIt wrote on LinkedIn this week that its Droid NW 40 \"is the first codified reconnaissance and strike UGV\" that is adapted for the US-made Mk-19 40mm and the Ukrainian-made AGL-53 automatic grenade launchers.\n\nThe American-made Mk-19 has been an important weapon for NATO militaries over the past few decades. The domestically made AGL-53 was approved by Ukraine's military this year. Both are important for Ukraine as it seeks to modernize and not rely on its Soviet-designed weapons.\n\nDevDroid said the codification means the robot is \"approved for service with the Defense Forces and meets NATO standards.\"\n\nIt said the system is designed to attack personnel and light armored vehicles at a range of 0.9 miles, with remote controls allowing operators to stay back.\n\nIt's not the first time that ground robots have been used to fire grenades in Ukraine. But it appears to be the first time that a design engineered to fire those key grenade launchers has had official approval for use.\n\nUkraine's Ministry of Defense could not be reached for immediate comment.\n\nA Ukrainian unit has shared images of a ground robot equipped with a different grenade launcher, and Oleksandr Yabchanka, the head of the robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that his unit has \"brilliant\" turrets that attach the MK-19 grenade launcher to some of its ground robots.\n\nHe said robots can be fitted with different weapons, like machine guns or grenade launchers, to fire at Russian positions. It means they can attack while keeping Ukrainian soldiers safer, as Russia is likely to return fire to wherever the attack comes from, and can also drive closer to Russian positions to launch the attacks.\n\nHe said ground robot systems are best when they work like Lego, with soldiers able to put the same system together in different ways to perform different functions, rather than having many different systems to use.\n\nUkrainian soldiers are constantly learning new ways to use existing weaponry and encouraging the development of new types. It means innovation can also happen before any official defense ministry involvement.\n\nThe war has been marked by constant innovation, with both large and small defense companies continually developing new types of technology, particularly in the areas of robotics and drones. This includes on the battlefield, where soldiers stay in communication with manufacturers to give feedback and get fast upgrades.\n\nThe way soldiers use some robotic systems has even come as a surprise to the manufacturers themselves, a testament to how rapidly the technology's use is developing.\n\nGround robots account for a tiny portion of Ukraine's drone use. Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said this month that in November, they accounted for less than 0.66% of Ukraine's total drone missions.\n\nAnd it is unclear how widely the Droid NW 40 will be used or how many can be manufactured.\n\nBut dozens of companies are working on the newer and growing tech in Ukraine, where its population is so much smaller than Russia's that it needs systems to allow it to fight without much manpower.\n\nDevDroid itself says that its system allows \"the execution of complex combat missions from a safe distance and minimizing risks to personnel.\"\n\nAnd the robots' achievements are growing too. A Ukrainian unit said on Monday that it used a DevDroid TW 12.7 that was equipped with a .50-caliber machine gun to hold frontline positions for 45 straight days.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine shared new details on Tuesday about a precursor mission for its first underwater drone strike against a Russian submarine, showing how its forces laid the groundwork for its main attack.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, released a video on Tuesday saying that it had first struck an Il-38N reconnaissance aircraft, also known as a Sea Dragon, using an aerial drone carrying an airburst warhead.\n\nThe security agency published footage of a flying drone approaching a Sea Dragon on its runway, saying it was carrying an explosive warhead that disperses over 2,000 fragments toward its target.\n\n\"The detonation occurred directly above the compartment housing the main equipment and radars and also damaged the engine,\" the SBU said.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the time or location of filming. The Russian defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe SBU said that disabling the aircraft was a key prior step for the later, main strike on the Russian submarine.\n\nThe Sea Dragon, which is designed to detect underwater threats, had been \"actively countering the operations of the SBU's maritime drones,\" the security service said.\n\n\"In the Black Sea, the Russians had only one aircraft of this class capable of detecting the 'Sub Sea Baby' underwater drone as it moved toward its target,\" the SBU added.\n\nThe SBU said the attack unfolded at the Yeysk air base.\n\nYeysk sits on the eastern flank of the Sea of Azov across from the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol, and is roughly 140 miles from the port of Novorossiysk.\n\nRussia stations many of its naval assets at this Black Sea port, which is also where the SBU said earlier this month that it attacked a Russian Kilo-class submarine with a Sub Sea Baby.\n\nThe drone is a version of the Sea Baby uncrewed surface vessel — which is equipped with an explosive warhead and designed to ram into its target — that is modified to run underwater.\n\nThe SBU released footage of an explosion near a pier in the port of Novorossiysk, though it's unclear when this video was filmed.\n\nRussia's Black Sea Fleet has denied that the attack caused significant damage to the Kilo-class sub.\n\nThe diesel-electric boat, estimated by Ukraine to be worth $400 million, is designed to carry up to four Kalibr cruise missiles. This precision missile type is often compared to the US Tomahawk and has been used regularly by Russia to attack Ukrainian cities.\n\nUkraine has no official navy of its own, but it has used drones and missiles to harass Russia's Black Sea Fleet and, at times, drive it away.\n\nThe SBU had earlier said that the attacked Kilo-class submarine was in Novorossiysk after retreating from Crimea due to Ukrainian attacks.",

    "fullText": "Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out a number of high-profile attacks against prominent Russians since Moscow invaded its neighbor nearly four years ago.\n\nWhile Kyiv has hinted at its involvement in some cases, Ukrainian officials have often stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility. In other cases, they have denied all involvement.\n\nOn Monday, a Russian general was killed by a car bomb in Moscow, and investigators say they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind the attack. Ukraine has not yet commented on the death of Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov.\n\nOther attacks that Russia has blamed on Ukraine include:\n\nKirillov, head of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed alongside his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, when a bomb planted on a scooter exploded outside an apartment building in Moscow in December 2024.\n\nKirillov had been charged in absentia a day earlier by Ukraine’s Security Service, the SBU, with ”ordering the use of banned chemical weapons against Ukraine’s Defense Forces.” The SBU later claimed responsibility for the attack. An Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on the security service’s behalf.\n\nMoskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department of the General Staff, was killed in April 2025. A bomb had been placed underneath his car, which was parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow.\n\nSeveral days after the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement that the country’s Foreign Intelligence Service had informed him of the “elimination of senior command personnel of Russia’s armed forces,” but gave no further details.\n\nA Russian man who previously lived in Ukraine pleaded guilty to carrying out the attack and said that he had been paid by Ukraine's security services.\n\nRzhitsky, a former submarine commander, was gunned down in July 2023 while jogging in Krasnodar, Russia.\n\nUkrainian media reported that Rzhitsky was one of six submarine commanders able to launch the long-range missiles that hit Vinnytsia, Ukraine, a year earlier, killing 23 people and wounding over 100.\n\nWhen he died, Rzhitsky was deputy head of a military mobilization office in Krasnodar.\n\nKyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate, denied Kyiv’s involvement in the death. However, the agency also released details about the killing, including the time of the attack and the number of shots fired. A dual Russian-Ukrainian citizen was convicted in the killing in October 2024.\n\nPrilepin, a nationalist Russian writer, narrowly avoided death in a car bombing in Russia’s Nizhny Novgorod region in May 2023. His driver was killed, while Prilepin was hospitalized with broken bones, bruised lungs and other injuries.\n\nPrilepin, known for his support of the war, was sanctioned by the European Union.\n\nA Ukrainian was found guilty of the attack in a Russian court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Russia’s Investigative Committee accused him of working on orders from Kyiv.\n\nIn an interview with Ukrainian journalists in March 2024, SBU chief Lt. Gen. Vasyl Maliuk declined to take responsibility for the attack, but said he could provide some details, such as Prilepin's injuries.\n\nTatarsky, a military blogger, was killed in April 2023 when a bomb tore through a cafe in central St Petersburg where he had been speaking.\n\nTatarsky supported the war in Ukraine and filed regular reports from the front for his Telegram followers.\n\nDarya Trepova was convicted of the bombing and sentenced to 27 years in prison after she was seen on camera presenting a small statue to Tatarsky that exploded shortly afterward. Trepova testified she didn’t know the gift contained a bomb.\n\nIn the March 2024 interview, SBU chief Maliuk also declined to take responsibility for Tatarsky's death, but describing the blogger as a mouthpiece for Russia who had \"paid a karmic price before the Ukrainian people.” He also provided details on the bomb that killed Tatarsky.\n\nKyva, a Ukrainian lawmaker who fled to Russia shortly after the full-scale invasion, was found dead near Moscow in December 2023 with a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nA controversial political figure in Ukraine before the war, Kyva often appeared on pro-Kremlin TV talk shows. A month before his death, a Ukrainian court found him guilty in absentia of treason and sentenced him to 14 years in prison.\n\nRussia’s state Investigative Committee accused an Armenian-born businessman of passing on details about Kyva’s movements to the SBU, state news agency Tass said. However, no charges have been brought directly related to the killing.\n\nAndriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, said after Kyva’s death that “the same fate will befall other traitors of Ukraine,” but did not say who was behind the killing.\n\nDugina was killed in August 2022 when a remote-controlled bomb planted in her SUV blew up as she drove on Moscow’s outskirts.\n\nHer father, Alexander Dugin, was widely believed to be the intended target. The philosopher, writer and political theorist is an ardent supporter of the war.\n\nUkraine denied responsibility for the attack, with Zelenskyy saying Dugina was “not our responsibility\" and Kyiv was \"not interested in her.”\n\nRussia’s Federal Security Agency, the FSB, publicly identified two Ukrainian citizens as suspects, but said they had escaped abroad.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

Moments later, the drone strikes, hitting the soldier as he attempts to escape. The explosion spooks another horse, which unseats its rider before making a charge in another direction. A third rider is seen, but his fate is unknown.\n\n“Russian occupiers lose so much equipment during their ‘meat-grinder assaults’ that they’re forced to move on horseback,” the 92nd Brigade wrote in a post accompanying the footage.\n\nVladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has been defined by rapid technological advances on the front lines, in particular in drone warfare. Small, off-the-shelf explosive drones have proved effective at defending against mechanised units and infantry.\n\nRussia recently introduced motorbikes and all-terrain vehicles as a way to speed across open countryside monitored by drones.\n\nHorses could offer yet more flexibility – agile on off-road terrain and less likely to trigger modern landmines equipped with magnetic sensors. The first horse-mounted casualty was reported by observers of the war in Ukraine in October.\n\nAt the same time, The Telegraph reported that the Storm unit of Russia’s 9th Brigade of the 51st Army had been preparing horse-mounted assault teams to operate in the Donetsk region.\n\nBefore this, there had been numerous reports of Russia utilising donkeys, horses and even camels to transport ammunition and other heavy equipment to the front line through muddy conditions not suitable for regular vehicles.\n\nThroughout the ages, horseback cavalry charges have provided speed, shock and flexibility on the battlefield.\n\nTanks and other heavily-armoured fighting machines are rarely seen on the battlefields of Ukraine and, when they do appear, they are almost instantly disabled by a wave of drones.\n\nRussia’s Kommersant newspaper said of the return of cavalry: “In armed conflicts that have become arenas for showcasing technological innovations, participants are once again forced to rely on basic tools – from analogue telephone lines to pack animals and carts – when modern technologies prove vulnerable.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Initial drafts of U.S. proposals for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia meet many of Kyiv's demands, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, although he suggested that neither side in the almost four-year war is likely to get everything it wants in talks on reaching a settlement.\n\n“Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage,” the Ukrainian leader said of recent talks with U.S. officials who are trying to steer the neighboring countries toward compromises.\n\n“There are some things we are probably not ready for, and I’m sure there are things the Russians are not ready for either,” Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has for months been pushing for a peace agreement, but the negotiations have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nU.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives, though Trump was less effusive the following day, saying, “The talks are going along.”\n\n“We are talking. It's going OK,\" Trump said Monday while on vacation at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Asked if he planned to speak to Zelenskyy or Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump didn't say, offering only of the fighting, “I'd like to see it stopped.”\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, said “nearly 90%” of Ukraine’s demands have been incorporated into the draft agreements.\n\nThe backbone of the proposed deal is a 20-point plan, he said. There is also a framework document on security guarantees between Ukraine, European countries, and the United States, as well as a separate document on bilateral security guarantees granted to Ukraine by the U.S.\n\nZelenskyy mentioned several key points, such as the Ukrainian army remaining at a peacetime level of 800,000; membership in the European Union; and European forces, under the leadership of France and the U.K. and with a “backstop” from Washington, ensuring “Ukraine’s security in the air, on land, and at sea.”\n\n“Some key countries will provide presence in these domains; others will contribute to energy security, finance, bomb shelters, and so on,” the Ukrainian president said.\n\nUkraine is arguing that the bilateral document with the U.S. should be reviewed by the U.S. Congress, with some details and annexes kept classified, Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe U.S. team is now in talks with Russian envoys, and Washington has asked that no details be released, he added.\n\nUkraine strikes deep inside Russia\n\nZelenskyy said Monday he met with his military commanders who reported that defensive lines are holding firm against the Russian onslaught.\n\n“In (recent) weeks, the Russian army has significantly increased the intensity of attacks, and the number of Russian losses has increased accordingly,” he said in a post on Telegram.\n\nUkrainian forces hit an oil terminal, a pipeline, two parked jet fighters and two ships in a series of strikes on Russian soil, officials said Monday.\n\nThe attacks are part of an ongoing campaign to disrupt the Russian war effort and sow fear behind the front line, where outnumbered Ukrainian troops are straining to hold back Russia’s bigger army.\n\nThe strikes also seek to undermine Putin’s attempt to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of military strength in U.S.-led peace efforts, which have yet to make a breakthrough on key points.\n\nThe killing of a top Russian general by a car bomb in Moscow on Monday, with investigators suspecting Ukraine was behind it, could be another instance of Kyiv picking surprise targets.\n\nUkrainian partisans burn Russian fighter jets\n\nUkrainian forces struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, an ammunition depot and a launch site for attack drones inside Russian territory and Russian-held Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s General Staff said in a statement Monday.\n\nA pipeline, two docks and two ships were damaged in the southern Krasnodar region, and a large blaze broke out, the statement said, without specifying what kind of weapons were used in the attack.\n\nIt added that a Ukrainian-made missile also hit a temporary base for Russia's 92nd River Boat Brigade in Olenivka, in the occupied Crimean Peninsula.\n\nA separate strike targeted an ammunition depot in a Russian-controlled portion of the Donetsk region, aiming to slow the Russian advance there, the General Staff said. A Russian launch site for attack drones was also hit.\n\nUkrainian partisans set fire to two Russian jet fighters in an operation on Sunday evening at a base near Lipetsk, a city in western Russia, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense said only that its forces shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight, three of them over the Krasnodar region.\n\nRussia targets the power grid again\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces kept up their targeting of Ukraine’s energy sector, aiming to deprive civilians of heat and running water during the frigid winter. Russia has tried to knock out power in Ukraine throughout the war, in a tactic that Ukraine refers to as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nEnergy infrastructure across five regions were attacked during the night, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 86 drones of different types overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Ukrainian forces stopped 58 of them, it said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Ukraine said it destroyed two more Russian fighter jets by sneaking into an airfield hangar over the weekend, estimating the destroyed aircrafts' combined worth at up to $100 million.\n\nThe hits add to the large haul of Russian jets Ukraine says it has been able to strike even at bases hundreds of miles from the front lines. Business Insider was not able to independently verify Ukraine's claim.\n\nUkraine's destruction of aircraft has hampered Russia's ability to be effective in the air in its invasion of Ukraine. It has also caused concern among Western militaries about how well they can protect their own assets if potential adversaries like Russia and China were to use similar tactics against them.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence directorate (GUR) reported the kill on Monday, saying its operation put two Russian Su-30 aircraft out of action.\n\nIt shared video footage that appeared to be filmed inside a hangar, showing two aircraft tail numbers, the inside of a cockpit, and flames inside at least one aircraft.\n\nA post shared by Головне управління розвідки МО України (@diukraine)\n\nThe GUR said an agent was able to enter an airfield near the city of Lipetsk in western Russia, attack the jets in the hangar, and then leave the airfield unnoticed as a result of studying its patrol route and guard change schedule.\n\nThe Su-30 is a Soviet-designed, twin-engine fighter jet. The GUR originally said that a Su-30 and a Su-27 were hit, but later revised its information to say that it was two Su-30s.\n\nThe GUR did not give details on how the attack was carried out.\n\nIt said the attack was planned for two weeks and conducted by an agent connected to the resistance movement that opposes Russia's invasion. There are multiple resistance groups in Russia and in Russian-occupied Ukraine that oppose the war and that have claimed sabotage attacks on Russia.\n\nUkraine has previously been able to destroy Russian jets by getting personnel close to Russian air bases. Earlier this year, it sneaked more than one hundred drones into Russian territory and launched them near key airbases, hitting dozens of aircraft in its Operation Spiderweb.\n\nThat sparked concern over how the West can protect its air assets, including ones close to China.\n\nUkraine also claimed another big win this weekend, with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Saturday saying that drones struck two Russian Su-27 jets on an airfield. Business Insider was not able to independently verify Ukraine's claim of this attack.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has been a fierce battle for control of the air, with neither side able to gain full air superiority. That has contributed to the war now being a slow-moving battle, with neither military able to easily launch large attacks on or bomb the other's positions.\n\nUkraine has used new and innovative means to hit Russian aircraft, including by developing long-range drones and naval drones, which it said have destroyed Russian jets in a historic first.\n\nRussia has also been able to destroy Ukrainian jets throughout the war, and it has demonstrated its own capability to conduct long-range attacks. It sends huge barrages of drones and missiles across Ukraine, hitting both military and civilian targets.\n\nThe war has also been a wake-up call for the West. The West has not fought a war like this in decades and instead has been in conflicts, like counter-insurgency operations, where it has had big advantages over its adversaries, particularly in the air.\n\nThe West, since the end of the Cold War, has not heavily invested in the kinds of ground-based air defense that are key to stopping the attacks common in this war. Investment in them is now a priority for NATO.\n\nAnother problem for the West is that this war shows how cheap drones, worth thousands of dollars, can destroy aircraft and other advanced weaponry worth millions.\n\nThe types of air defenses that the US and its allies have focused on for decades are unsustainable. For example, one interceptor missile for the US-made Patriot air defense system costs $7 million. Firing dozens of those to stop an attack by cheap drones is a position no Western military wants to be in.\n\nNATO is eyeing up far cheaper defenses to stop drone attacks and protect assets like bases, learning from some of the tech Ukraine has developed.",

    "title": "Ukraine's trench war runs on an easily overlooked weapon: grenades",
    "description": "Soldiers in Ukraine say that grenades are key for close-quarters trench fighting, and Western forces are paying attention.",
    "fullText": "Grenades — a standard but often unglamorous part of modern infantry combat — have become indispensable in Ukraine's close-quarters and grueling fight against Russia's invasion.\n\nThe war blends advanced technologies like drones and electronic warfare with grinding, World War I-style fighting, where soldiers sometimes battle at arm's length in muddy trenches and bunkers. In those confined spaces, Ukrainian and Russian troops alike rely heavily on grenades.\n\nWestern officials and war veterans in Ukraine told Business Insider about the important role they play in Ukraine's trench warfare. Their use has also evolved, with grenades increasingly getting tactical upgrades, including adaptations for drone drops and components made with 3D printing.\n\nThe experience has highlighted a lesson for Western militaries less accustomed to modern trench fighting, the kind of combat that drives enormous demand for basic infantry munitions like grenades.\n\nUkraine's battlefield is littered with trenches unlike anything the West has seen for decades, with soldiers needing hides and defenses from the attack and surveillance drones that fly overhead, and the brutal fighting involves defending and taking these earthworks from the enemy.\n\nA US veteran who fought in Ukraine and spoke with Business Insider on the condition of anonymity said that \"when you go through these trenches, hand grenades are your best fucking friends.\"\n\nHe said the fights are so close-quarters that in some engagements with the Russians, \"you could literally touch them with the muzzle of your rifle at times.\"\n\nTrenches are messy, uneven, and difficult to capture. \"You're basically trying to take the home of another individual who's lived there for days, weeks, months at this point,\" the vet said. \"So they know every nook and cranny; they know every turn.\"\n\nA British man who fought for Ukraine previously told Business Insider that he carried grenades for both assault and reconnaissance missions and described the US and UK-made grenades as \"prized\" among Ukrainians.\n\nLt. Col. Davidson, a leader in the UK-led training program for Ukrainian soldiers called Operation Interflex, told Business Insider last year on the condition that only his rank and last name be used that \"Ukrainians have got a heavy use of grenades.\" That usage was worked into the training in response.\n\nThere is a wide range of grenades in use in battle, everything from fragmentation and explosive to flashbang and chemical.\n\nA Ukrainian officer recently told Business Insider that smoke grenades can help to create poor visibility so injured soldiers can be evacuated, though it can also risk drawing unwanted Russian attention.\n\nCombat video footage shared by Ukrainian units often shows grenades in action, including footage of US volunteers using them in an assault on a Russian trench.\n\nUkraine's grenades come from multiple sources, from old Soviet-era stocks to those of partner nations.\n\nA January 2025 Department of Defense update said the US had provided \"more than 50,000 grenade launchers and small arms\" and \"more than 500,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition and grenades\" to Ukraine. And the US isn't the only supplier. The volume supplied reflects how central these weapons are to front-line combat. Ukraine also makes its own grenades.\n\nIt's not alone, though. Russia is also heavily using these weapons, including in the booby traps it sets up in trenches and urban environments.\n\nUkraine feels it when it has shortages of grenades. Another US veteran told Business Insider on the condition of anonymity last year that, with US aid stalled and Ukraine suffering weaponry shortages, he was often told to be \"careful practicing with grenades\" so as not to waste too many.\n\nAnd when it was time to swap positions, troops taking over would ask those departing to leave any remaining grenades and ammunition.\n\n\"That's how desperate that situation got to where it's like guys were literally getting ammo and grenades off of dudes leaving the area so that they could keep fighting.\"\n\nGrenades have long been a staple of infantry combat, including in the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But Ukraine's conflict has pushed their use to levels more typical of large-scale, attritional warfare, where trench systems stretch for miles and fighting drags on for months and years.\n\nWestern militaries did not anticipate the return of large-scale trench warfare, and in Ukraine that fighting has pushed grenades to the center of daily front-line combat.\n\nLong a standard tool in close-quarters fighting, they have become especially prominent amid widespread trenches, ammunition shortages, and evolving tactics.\n\nWhile they're being used in close-quarters combat, grenades are also being dropped from drones in battles all along the front lines, hitting soldiers, bunkers, hideouts, and even vehicles.\n\nVery recent footage from Novopavlivka front, drone dropping grenade RIGHT INTO RUSSIAN TANK HATCH.\n\nIt falls right into the hatch, destroying the tank from the inside.\n\nHonestly, tanks were so rare this year at the battlefield, and this is just BEAUTIFUL to watch. pic.twitter.com/Ns4NKBH2Qp\n\nA US Army Colonel said doing this has \"proved dramatically effective\" for Ukraine. The Army first tested dropping a live grenade from a drone this year. It's catching up.\n\nUkrainian units and engineers are also 3D-printing parts to make old grenades work better with drones while printing plastic casings to fill with explosives to make custom grenades.\n\nWorried about Russia sparking a wider war with Europe, much of the West is watching to see what lessons it can learn from Ukraine.\n\nMaj. Maguire, a British military officer who led part of the Operation Interflex training and helped document lessons from Ukraine, told Business Insider that the scale and importance of grenade use in trench fighting have stood out. He spoke on the condition that only his rank and last name be used.\n\n\"There's a massive demand for grenades,\" he said.\n\nThe West is looking at trench warfare more, too, and rethinking how messy and dangerous trenches can be and the weapons needed for a fight.\n\nUkraine's war has shown that even on a high-tech battlefield, sustained close combat in trenches still depends on basic infantry weapons and on having enough of them.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — A car bomb killed a Russian general on Monday, the third such killing of a senior military officer in a year. Investigators said Ukraine may be behind the attack.\n\nLt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, died from his injuries, said Svetlana Petrenko, the spokesperson for Russia’s Investigative Committee, the nation's top criminal investigation agency.\n\n“Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder. One of these is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services,” Petrenko said.\n\nSince Moscow sent troops into Ukraine nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Ukraine for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them. It has not yet commented on Monday's death.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Vladimir Putin had been immediately informed about Sarvarov's killing.\n\nThe Defense Ministry said that Sarvarov had previously fought in Chechnya and taken part in Moscow's military campaign in Syria.\n\nJust over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov's assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAn Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on behalf of the Ukrainian security service.\n\nPutin described Kirillov’s killing as a “major blunder” by Russia’s security agencies, noting they should learn from it and improve their efficiency.\n\nIn April, another senior Russian military officer, Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the General Staff, was killed by an explosive device placed in his car parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow. A suspected perpetrator was quickly arrested.\n\nDays after Moskalik's killing, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes\" although he didn't mention Moskalik's name.",

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",

He promised that Putin would not be able to influence a possible vote on the future Ukrainian president.\n\nThe criticism was triggered by Putin's statements on Friday at his annual press conference, where he not only once again demanded presidential elections in the neighbouring country he invaded and criticized the current Ukrainian leadership as illegitimate, but also insisted that Ukrainians living in Russia should participate in the vote.\n\nPutin said there are between 5 million and 10 million Ukrainians in Russia. There are no diplomatic missions of Ukraine in Russia, where citizens abroad would normally vote. Putin's election official, Ella Pamfilova, said that the Russian authorities could organize the voting there.\n\nNo elections in Russia and occupied territories\n\n\"Ukrainian citizens who are in Ukraine in the Ukrainian-controlled areas will vote,\" Zelensky said in response.\n\nOnly there could honest and transparent elections be guaranteed, he said. In addition, there is the usual practice of voting in foreign missions.\n\n\"In the areas not controlled by Ukraine, no elections can be held because it is clear that they would be conducted there as Russia always does,\" he said, referring to international criticism of the questionable fairness of elections in Russia.\n\nMartial law prohibits elections during wartime\n\nPutin, who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has repeatedly stated since last year that Zelensky is no longer legitimate due to his expired term.\n\nKiev, however, points to martial law, which prohibits elections during wartime, thereby extending Zelensky's term. Internationally, Zelensky is still recognized as the Ukrainian president.\n\nRecently, however, US President Donald Trump adopted Putin's demand for new elections in Ukraine. Zelensky expressed his willingness to do so but demanded a ceasefire during the election to ensure the security of the vote.\n\nPutin's re-election in March 2024 was also sharply criticized as illegitimate in Western countries. The German government, for instance, classified the vote as \"neither free nor fair.\"\n\nReal opposition candidates were not allowed, there was a climate of intimidation, and there is no freedom of expression, said the then spokeswoman Christiane Hoffmann. Russia, she said, is now a dictatorship.",

    "description": "The Ukrainian drone schools training operators for the fight with Russia take safety steps like giving staff polygraph tests and hiding.",
    "fullText": "The leaders of several drone schools training Ukraine's operators for the fight against Russia say they're targets and they have to act accordingly — tightly protecting information and even moving around.\n\nThroughout its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has launched huge drone and missile barrages at factories, training sites, and civilian infrastructure across the country, often far from the fighting in the east, straining Ukrainian defenses and serving as a constant reminder that nowhere in the country is completely safe.\n\nDrones are prolific on the battlefield in Ukraine. Operators are priority targets. It stands to reason the schools training them for war would be too. Officials from three drone schools told Business Insider that they take steps to avoid getting hit.\n\nTetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, said that it must follow strict safety rules because \"the entirety of Ukraine is not safe, missile-wise, drone-wise.\"\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, told BI the safety measures, including not disclosing publicly exactly where its training centers are located and also changing their location \"from time to time,\" are necessary to prevent Russia from interfering with its training\n\nTo keep certain location data from getting out, the school doesn't allow photos and videos that might reveal where its facilities are based.\n\nThe school has been mentioned by Russia's military bloggers, influential pro-war accounts that often circulate operational details and commentary to large audiences. Though they are typically in favor of the war, they are also sometimes critical of Russia's performance and dispute some of its defense ministry's claims.\n\nRybar, a media outlet with 1.5 million Telegram subscribers, listed Dronarium as an example of Ukraine's drone training efforts. The UK has sanctioned Rybar, initially presented as a milblogger but actually a partially Russian government-sponsored information warfare operation, and the US has offered up to $10 million for information.\n\nTetyana said Russian outlets have been writing about the school since 2022, the year Russia started its full-scale invasion. \"As long as they write and talk about us, it means that they are afraid of us,\" she said. But it also means that they're on Russia's radar.\n\nShe said the school and its attendees strictly adhere to a set of critical cybersecurity rules, and said there are also general safety rules in place. \"When the air raid siren is on, all training activities, all the work, everything gets suspended, and we deconcentrate and get into safe shelters.\" She said no one is complacent.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that safety steps are crucial because \"the Russians are constantly hunting for places where military personnel gather.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have confirmed that Russia has hit some Ukrainian military training sites, killing personnel. It's the kind of thing air defenses can try to prevent, but Ukraine has suffered shortages throughout the war. Ukraine has also successfully hit Russian bases and gatherings of Russian personnel.\n\nThe key is to prevent Russia from gaining sufficient knowledge of the school to target it. Its steps include \"everyone who works at KK&A, including the cleaners,\" having to do a polygraph security interview.\n\nHe said they don't share any information about the location of the training center or about the appearance of the instructors or cadets.\n\n\"Some of our employees may have relatives or acquaintances in occupied territories who could be tortured by Russians for indirect contact with someone who opposes Russia,\" Pervak said. \"This secrecy also protects the instructors and cadets themselves, as well as their relatives, from attacks by Russian agents.\"\n\nHe said that while the added security \"hinders publicity to some extent — good things should be spoken about loudly — war dictates its own conditions. We are well aware that failing to observe the principles of secrecy may result in the death of staff or cadets.\"\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, said that \"Russia is interested in destroying us.\"\n\n\"Thanks to God and air defence, we're still operating.\"",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — President Vladimir Putin emphasized Friday that Moscow’s troops were advancing across the battlefield in Ukraine and voiced confidence the Kremlin would achieve its goals militarily if Kyiv doesn't agree to Russia's conditions in peace talks.\n\nSpeaking at his tightly orchestrated annual news conference that lasted about 4 1/2 hours, Putin declared that Russian forces have “fully seized strategic initiative” and would make more gains by year's end.\n\nIn the early days of the conflict in 2022, Ukraine's forces thwarted an attempt by Russia’s larger, better-equipped army, to capture the capital of Kyiv. But the fighting soon settled into grinding battles, and Moscow's troops have made slow and steady progress over the years. Putin frequently touts this progress — even though it's not the lightning advance many expected.\n\n“Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,” Putin said at the live news conference, which is combined with a nationwide call-in show that offers Russians across the country the opportunity to ask questions of their leader.\n\nPutin, 73, has ruled the country for 25 years and uses the event to cement his power and air his views on domestic and global affairs during a broadcast that mixes criticism of the West with promises of more social payments. Although he is sometimes asked about his personal life, he gives scant details.\n\nThis year, the news conference took place against the backdrop of a peace plan in Ukraine put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump. Despite the extensive diplomatic push, Washington’s efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nWhile the event has previously focused heavily on domestic questions — and has offered Putin a chance to expound on topics from the price of eggs to water cuts — Ukraine dominated it this year. Since it is highly choreographed, that could reflect the Kremlin’s desire to assuage the public after nearly four years of fighting.\n\nRussian demands remain unchanged\n\nPutin praised Trump's peace efforts and reaffirmed that Moscow was ready for a peaceful settlement that would address the “root causes” of the conflict, a reference to the Kremlin’s tough conditions for a deal. He said he has agreed to make “certain compromises” and “uneasy decisions” at the Alaska summit with Trump in August but didn't elaborate.\n\nHe wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He has also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured yet. Kyiv has publicly rejected all these demands.\n\nThe Kremlin has also insisted that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance members and would view them as “legitimate target.”\n\nPutin also has repeatedly said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language — demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members. But at the same time, he has emphasized that Ukraine believes NATO membership remains the best security guarantee.\n\n″The United States don’t see us in NATO, for now,\" Zelenskyy said this week. “Politicians change.”\n\nCommenting on Zelenskyy's statement that he was ready to call a presidential election if a ceasefire is established, Putin responded that Russia has held elections without demanding a truce. He said that Moscow was ready to consider the issue and could agree to halt attacks deep inside Ukraine on the election day, but noted that millions of Ukrainians living in Russia must have the right to vote. Ukraine introduced martial law banning elections, but Russia hasn't made such a move.\n\nPutin rebuffed Western claims about purported Russian plans to attack European nations as “sheer nonsense” aimed at deflecting public attention from domestic problems.\n\nHe particularly singled out NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for his statements about the Kremlin's aggressive intentions, pointing out Trump's recently published national security strategy that doesn’t name Russia as a direct adversary. “How can you prepare NATO for a war with Russia if the main member of NATO doesn't consider us as an enemy?” Putin said.\n\nHe alleged that European elites “impudently” backed Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and now hope the U.S. political landscape will change after the midterm elections to Congress, helping raise pressure on the White House.\n\nPutin says seizing Russian assets will backfire\n\nAs it faces grinding Russian advances across the front line and relentless attacks on its energy facilities, Ukraine desperately cash infusions from its Western allies.\n\nOn Friday, European Union leaders agreed to provide a massive interest-free loan, but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.\n\nThe leaders tried to reassure Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, that they would protect it from any retaliation from Moscow if it backed the plan, but the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.\n\nUsing Russian assets to help Kyiv would have amounted to “robbery,” Putin said, adding that the move would have spooked investors, “dealing not only an image blow but undermining confidence in the eurozone.”\n\nPutin says troop numbers are strong\n\nPutin said the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, topping 400,000 this year. It was not possible to independently verify that claim since little is known about the recruitment effort.\n\nBut the government offers relatively high pay and extensive benefits that have helped swell troop ranks. The Kremlin says it exclusively relies on volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but some media reports and rights groups have said that military officers often coerce conscripts into signing military contracts.\n\nAsked by a soldier’s widow about slow pension payments, Putin apologized and vowed the issue would be quickly resolved — a typical exchange at the annual event, which he often uses to show his command of a wide array of subjects and his ability to solve problems.\n\nThe news conference featured questions from journalists in the Gostinny Dvor amphitheater as well as via video links from across Russia. A young man in a red bow tie who held a placard saying he wanted to get married used his question to Putin to propose to his girlfriend. Later, one of the anchors hosting the event reported that she had answered “yes,” and Putin joked about collecting money for the wedding.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine’s dramatic escalation of its sea-drone attacks on tankers carrying Russian oil could spread to the English Channel, experts have warned.\n\nThe hit on an Oman-flagged tanker on Friday widened the Ukrainian operation from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, signalling that sanctioned tankers could be hit anywhere on their journey.\n\n“The Ukrainians are now operating across a much wider area. If you’re a shadow fleet vessel then there’s now a risk wherever you are,” said Matthew Wright, of trade intelligence firm Kpler.\n\n“You get shadow fleet vessels that come out of the Baltic Sea, they are essentially going through the North Sea. The threat to them is now higher.”\n\nMichelle Bockmann, from maritime data company Windward, said the Ukrainians were likely to continue focusing on empty tankers rather than those laden with oil, but the attacks could impose massive costs on the vessel operators.\n\nShe added: “Marine insurers have been saying for quite a while now that one of these vessels, if they have a casualty, especially if they go through the English Channel, that they’re a billion-dollar marine accident waiting to happen.\n\n“Ukraine is aware of this risk, and I think that’s why this is a new strategy, an evolving strategy, and definitely one to watch.”\n\nThere are close to 1,000 tankers involved in Russia’s shadow fleet – the vessels, often false-flagged and with obscure ownership, that ferry crude or refined Russian oil to customers primarily in India and China.\n\nAbout 600 carry exclusively Russian oil, which puts them within the Western sanctions net. Roughly another 350 carry Russian oil alongside other cargo.\n\nUkraine has carried out drone attacks on three shadow tankers in the Black Sea in the past month, and is also thought to have been behind an apparent limpet-mine explosion off the coast of Senegal.\n\nExperts said the broadening attacks could prompt some vessel owners to question whether the risk of working for Vladimir Putin was still worth the reward.\n\nThe attacks could drive up ship owners’ insurance premiums. The insurers are believed to be mostly Russian or Chinese, and Kpler said operators might start to worry about whether they would get a payout if attacked.\n\nKpler’s Mr Wright said: “The London insurance market is incredibly well capitalised. It can handle a lot of large claims because the risk is spread. Whereas we don’t have a lot of visibility of how well capitalised the insurers are who cover the Russian shadow fleet.\n\n“If you’re a shadow fleet owner, you’d be asking whether you might get paid out. It will make a lot of the owners who have been leading players in the shadow fleet think about whether the risk-reward is worth it.”\n\nThe vessel owners could react to the bigger risks by raising the prices they charge Russia, further squeezing the Kremlin’s war chest.\n\nUkrainian security sources told local media this calculus made these tankers fair game.\n\n“The aggressor state used this tanker to circumvent sanctions and earn money that was used for the war against Ukraine,” the sources were quoted as saying.\n\n“Therefore ... this is an absolutely legitimate target. The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop, and will beat him anywhere in the world.”\n\nThe Ukrainian action underscores the extent to which civilian tankers have become involved in geopolitical conflict and tension this year, with the US also blockading oil-freight traffic around Venezuela.\n\nMs Bockmann said this blurring of the line between the commercial and military domains was making the industry “uneasy”.\n\nArsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the UN’s International Maritime Organisation, this week urged restraint.\n\n“As the situation continues to escalate in the Black Sea, I call on all parties to refrain from targeting innocent seafarers, port workers and merchant ships,” he said.\n\n“Shipping should not be used as collateral in geopolitical situations and there is an increased environmental risk developing.”\n\nThe Ukrainians appear to be targeting only empty tankers, to avoid triggering an environmental disaster.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — The young journalist in a red bow tie stood during President Vladimir Putin's annual news conference Friday and displayed a sign saying he wanted to get married. But his main question wasn't directed at Putin — it was to his girlfriend, Olga, proposing marriage.\n\nPutin complimented Kirill Bazhanov of Yekaterinburg’s Channel 4 on his snazzy tie, saying, \"You’re ready to go to the registry office!” Bazhanov told Putin “we’d be very glad to see you at the wedding.”\n\nThe Russian leader’s year-end media session had serious questions, of course, about late pension payments, construction projects gone wrong, and the fighting in Ukraine, where Putin sent troops nearly four years ago.\n\nBut every year — amid the weighty questions from the domestic and international media — there are also odd and lighter moments, like this year when people asked Putin what his license plate number was and whether love at first sight existed.\n\nIt’s all part of the spectacle of the tightly orchestrated event — an opportunity for Putin, who has ruled Russia for 25 years, to expound on a wide array of subjects as well as to burnish his image as a fatherly figure to address the concerns of ordinary Russians who submit questions in advance.\n\nBazhanov did actually have a question for Putin — about greater support for young families. Later in the 4 1/2-hour news conference, one of the anchors passed along the news that Bazhanov's girlfriend had said yes. Putin promptly quipped about collecting money for the wedding.\n\nFor those inside Moscow’s Gostinny Dvor amphitheater, the most important task was to get Putin's attention. Most brought signs and some wore national dress. One reporter brought a clutch of Labubu dolls personalized to look like Russian officials and one in the form of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nOne reporter asked whether a comet approaching Earth could be a UFO, and reassured Putin that the city of Tyumen would be ready to welcome any extraterrestrial guests.\n\nPutin seemed unfazed throughout, although Tajik journalist Shamsudin Boboyev caused a brief commotion when he tried to give Putin a book. Two security officials quickly stopped him from going onstage, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested Boboyev should simply describe the gift, which would be given to him later.\n\nToward the end of the session, a journalist who noted that Putin had said earlier he believed in love at first sight asked him if he was in love. The Russian leader, whose private life remains closely guarded, answered simply, “Yes.”\n\nDavies reported from Manchester, England.",

    "description": "A source in the Security Service of Ukraine told Business Insider that the attack was carried out more than 1,240 miles away.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range drones to strike an oil tanker said to be part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time, a security source told Business Insider on Friday.\n\nThe attack, carried out over 1,240 miles from Ukrainian territory, represents a dramatic expansion of Kyiv's push to target Russia's vast energy sector, a key source of revenue fueling its war machine.\n\nUkraine had previously limited its attacks to land-based targets, such as oil refineries and port infrastructure. In recent weeks, though, it has begun striking tankers in the Black Sea and facilities in the Caspian Sea — and now it's hitting targets in the Mediterranean.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, called the drone attack an \"unprecedented special operation\" that targeted and critically damaged the tanker Qendil. The source was only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe SBU source said the Qendil wasn't carrying any oil cargo at the time of the attack, so there isn't any risk to the environment. Footage shows several explosions on the exterior of the tanker.\n\nPublicly available ship-tracking data show that the Qendil was sailing under the flag of Oman. It's unclear when the attack took place; the vessel last reported its location on Friday sailing off the coast of Libya in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy immediately responded to a request for comment on the attack.\n\nUkraine has attacked at least four tankers, including the Qendil, that have been identified as belonging to the \"shadow fleet\" since late November. There are hundreds of vessels in the fleet, which Moscow relies on to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports.\n\nRussia used the Qendil \"to circumvent sanctions and earn money that went to the war against Ukraine,\" the SBU source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider, calling the ship a \"legitimate target\" for the SBU.\n\nThe enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop and will beat him anywhere in the world, wherever he is,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drone strikes to target Russian energy infrastructure in an effort to squeeze a key source of revenue for Moscow. While the campaign initially focused on land-based facilities, Kyiv has recently expanded it to maritime targets, hitting oil tankers in the Black and Mediterranean seas and striking three oil platforms in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe expansion to maritime targets appears to reflect a shift in Kyiv's strategy as it continues to press its international partners to be more aggressive in clamping down on Russian oil exports.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the ongoing deep-strike campaign as \"long-range\" sanctions against Moscow. These operations have been a bright spot for Kyiv as it faces incremental — but costly — Russian gains on the battlefield.",

    "description": "In the last year, Ukraine's interceptors have gone from novel technology to being produced in the thousands every month.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's defense ministry said on Thursday that it has been supplying its troops with roughly 950 interceptor drones every day since the beginning of December.\n\nIn its statement, the ministry said these drones were specifically to \"counter enemy Shahed-type UAVs.\"\n\nReaching nearly 1,000 daily delivered interceptors is a significant milestone for the production of such drones, which were largely still in prototyping stages at the start of the year.\n\nThese interceptors are first-person-view drones designed to fly into and destroy enemy aerial systems, typically using explosives or direct impact. A typical interceptor drone flies with four motor-powered propellers, but unlike the usual quadcopters, it is often shaped like a bullet or a rocket.\n\nInitially built to destroy high-flying reconnaissance craft, they've since been evolved by Ukrainians to take down long-range attack drones at a low cost — primarily as a response to Russia launching large waves of Iranian-designed Shaheds this year.\n\n\"These systems strengthen protection against drone terror while preserving resources for intercepting cruise and ballistic missiles,\" Ukraine's defense minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in Thursday's announcement.\n\nThe defense ministry also said it's been working with more than 10 interceptor manufacturers and has placed more orders for next year.\n\nFor Ukraine, interceptors must be fast enough to chase down drones such as the Shahed-136, which flies at a typical speed of 115 mph, while remaining cheap so that Kyiv's troops can sustainably use hundreds of them a day. Russia has recently been attacking with roughly 5,500 Shahed-type drones a month.\n\nSome Ukrainian drone makers have also been attempting to develop interceptors that can catch the Geran-3, the Russian version of the jet-powered Shahed-238, which can reportedly fly at an estimated 230 mph.\n\nUkraine's new production capacity comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in November that his country was producing roughly 600 to 800 interceptors a day, falling short of his initial goal.\n\nIn July, Zelenskyy had set a production target of 1,000 interceptors a day.\n\nUkraine's volunteer movements directly sponsor some interceptor drones for select military units, though their quantity is often limited compared to the scale of what the Ukrainian government provides.\n\nFor example, deliveries of the Wild Hornets' Sting, a $2,500 interceptor, were mostly sponsored this year by the Sternenko Foundation, a local crowdfunding organization.",

    "fullText": "Russia's defense ministry broadcast its wide-ranging annual review on Wednesday of the Ukraine war, providing clues about its military goals and performance this year.\n\nAndrei Belousov, the Russian defense minister, presented the official statistics during the Defense Ministry Board's expanded meeting in Moscow.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the defense ministry's claims, which often differ significantly from those of international observers. Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, said at the meeting that the Kremlin's troops were \"crushing\" Ukraine, despite the war dragging on for nearly four years.\n\nThe disclosures also come as Russia has sought to project strength and demanded heavy concessions from Ukraine while negotiating potential peace terms with the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, Belousov's presentation offers insight into Russia's ambitions for the war and its official narratives surrounding how it fights and plans to fight next year. Several new official figures were also announced.\n\nHere are 10 highlights from Belousov's end-of-year review.\n\nBelousov said that Russia's war spending is on track to reach about 5.1% of the country's GDP in 2025, out of an overall defense budget that reaches 7.3% of its annual GDP.\n\nThe country's nominal GDP in 2024 was about 201.2 trillion rubles, and is expected to grow 1% this year to about 203 trillion rubles, or $2.52 trillion.\n\nRussian independent media, however, reported that the economic ministry has forecast a GDP of about $2.7 trillion for the year.\n\nA war budget of 5.1% would therefore be somewhere between $128 billion and $137.7 billion.\n\nThis is the first time Russia has publicly disclosed the amount that it spends specifically on the war. Previously, the Kremlin only announced figures for total defense spending.\n\nThe US, by comparison, is planning to spend $901 billion on its military, or about 3.4% of its GDP.\n\nBelousov said that his ministry delivered roughly 38,000 motorcycles, buggies, and all-terrain vehicles to its troops on the front lines in 2025.\n\n\"This is 10 times more than last year,\" he said, adding that Russia plans to reach \"full strength\" in these vehicles next year.\n\nRussian troops have increasingly been using motorcycles, quad bikes, and other small, unarmored vehicles to assault or approach Ukrainian positions, trying to use their speed and small size to avoid drone attacks.\n\nUkrainians have also adopted the tactic, with one regiment even establishing an official motorcycle attack company in May.\n\nBelousov said that Russia hired 409,611 new contract soldiers in 2025, down from 449,243 in 2024.\n\nHowever, that already exceeds the Kremlin's 403,000 person recruitment goal for the year.\n\n\"Nearly two-thirds of them were young men under 40,\" Belousov said of the new recruits. \"More than a third have higher or specialized secondary education.\"\n\nUkraine and Russia have both been hard-pressed to fill their ranks as Moscow pressures Kyiv's forces with a continuous grind of frontal infantry assaults.\n\nTo maintain its flow of troops, Russia often entices recruits with hefty sign-on bonuses or pardons for crimes committed in the country.\n\nBelousov said that about 50% of Ukrainian casualties from Russian attacks come from first-person-view drones, or FPV drones. These are the small quadcopters mounted with explosives that have become a hallmark of the war.\n\nIn the summer, Russia said that it was outproducing Ukraine on FPV drones, though Kyiv's officials have since said their country has caught back up.\n\nUkrainian leaders have said that 70% of all casualties inflicted during the war involved FPV drones.\n\nBelousov said that Russia plans to create a new drone formation called the Unmanned Systems Forces next year, which would train \"tens of thousands\" of people.\n\nRussia has already created an official drone unit called Rubicon, which was formed last August to prioritize fighting with FPV drones and has often been described as fielding its most elite pilots.\n\nNow, Moscow appears to be trying to make such warfare an official pillar of its fighting force.\n\nBelousov said the Kremlin needed to transition FPV drone attacks from individual tasks carried out by each unit to \"integrated joint operations\" among its forces.\n\nUkraine launched its own Unmanned Systems Forces last year, appointing the previous commander of the elite unit, Magyar Birds, as its leader.\n\nRoughly 27,400 Ukrainian long-range drones were intercepted this year over Russian territory, with the bulk appearing after the summer, Belousov said.\n\nBelousov said that Ukraine initially began sending about 1,000 drones a month into Russia, but that the monthly number began hitting 3,700 by May.\n\nThe defense minister claimed that Russia's interception rate \"averages 97%\" for the year.\n\nUkraine has typically used fixed-wing drones to attack deeper into Russia, targeting what it says are oil and gas facilities and military production sites.\n\nUkrainian kamikaze \"drones\" aka converted Ukrainian-produced Aeroprakt A-22 Foxbat light aircraft.\n\nThese drones can reportedly deliver 300kg warheads at a range around 2000 - 3000 km.\n\nIt's believed that similar drones were recently used to hit a Shahed drone manufacturing… pic.twitter.com/8xw6BzoZvO\n\nNotably, Belousov mentioned that Russia has also been exploring FPV drones that can serve as high-speed interceptors, a technology that Ukraine has been refining to counter Moscow's Shahed waves.\n\nBelousov said that Russia received two Tu-160Ms, which are modernized, supersonic bombers that can deploy nuclear weapons or powerful stealth missiles.\n\nThat's a clue about the production rate of the bombers, which are part of a small fleet that forms a vital pillar of Russia's nuclear triad. Several of Russia's older bombers were reported severely damaged in Operation Spiderweb, an audacious Ukrainian drone attack in early June that targeted a fleet of about 41 warplanes.\n\nUkrainian sources claimed that several Tu-160s were also hit, although this was not confirmed by independent open-source intelligence at the time.\n\nRussia's military also appears to be modifying its organizational structure.\n\nBelousov said that the Kremlin had created five new divisions, 13 new brigades, and 30 new regiments in 2025. International think tanks estimate that Russian divisions can consist of between 10,000 and 20,000 troops, while regiments within typically have about 2,000 soldiers and are further split into battalions.\n\nBrigades, which typically exist as a separate formation, often have about 3,500 to 4,500 troops.\n\nBelousov said this new structure included a new division, called the Aerospace Forces, which has a regiment \"equipped with the unique S-500 antiaircraft missile system, capable of striking targets in near space.\"\n\nNext year, the Kremlin plans to add four more divisions, 14 brigades, and 39 new regiments, he added.\n\nSome of these figures encompass formations that Russia has transformed, so they aren't necessarily an indicator of how widely Russia is expanding its military organization structure. For example, Belousov said two marine brigades were turned into a single division.\n\nBelousov said that Russia had expanded its use of drones and all-terrain vehicles to deliver gear from a \"one-time operation\" in 2024 to carrying 12,000 tons of cargo this year to the front lines.\n\n\"By 2026, this figure must be at least doubled,\" he said.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia have been developing uncrewed ground vehicles, or ground-based drones, that can be remotely operated to deliver supplies to the front line or even conduct assaults.\n\nThe emerging technology is especially useful for dangerous tasks that would otherwise have to be filled by a human soldier.\n\nSome military units have also reported using drones to deliver equipment by air, such as one Ukrainian commander who said his forces used drones to send an e-bike to a stranded soldier.\n\nBelousov's presentation made it clear that Russia has been conducting precision strikes against Ukraine's power facilities.\n\nMore than 70% of Ukraine's thermal power plants and 37% of its hydroelectric plants have been disabled, Belousov said.\n\n\"The effectiveness of Russian precision strikes is about 60%, which is an order of magnitude higher than the effectiveness of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory,\" Belousov said.\n\n\"Ukraine's energy capacity has been reduced by more than half,\" he added.\n\nAttacking energy infrastructure is a war crime if it's found to be intentionally carried out to cause harm to civilians. Ukraine's besieged power grid is especially crucial, as it's essential for keeping its citizens warm during harsh winters.\n\nBelousov said the strikes on energy facilities were targeting the Ukrainian military, and that disabling the grid cut off power to Kyiv's forces.\n\nHowever, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said last September that Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid were found to be severely affecting civilians and had \"disproportionately impacted\" vulnerable groups.\n\nUkraine also carries out attacks on Russian oil and gas facilities, though it said its aim is to cripple Moscow's ability to export energy and sustain war production.",

    "title": "Ukraine says its small propeller battle drones can now go faster than Formula 1 cars",
    "description": "Mykhailo Fedorov said the drone was powered by a motor built in Ukraine. Its reported speed nearly rivals the fastest high-speed trains in the world.",
    "fullText": "A small Ukrainian drone built to chase down and intercept other aerial systems has recently achieved a speed of 400 kmph, or 248.5 mph, Kyiv's digital transformation minister said on Tuesday.\n\n\"400 km/h — that's the speed reached by an interceptor drone powered by a motor from Motor-G, a member of Brave1UA,\" Mykhailo Fedorov wrote in a social media post. Brave1 is Ukraine's defense innovation platform.\n\nSuch a velocity means that the interceptor can beat the official speed record for Formula 1 racing, achieved by Valtteri Bottas in 2016 at 231.46 mph.\n\nA speed of 248.5 mph also allows the drone to nearly match the fastest high-speed trains in the world. The Shanghai Maglev, for example, reached speeds of 280 mph during tests in October, but is commercially operated at 186 mph.\n\nAnd a motor-powered interceptor would be doing so with propellers, rather than the jet engines or high-thrust combustion systems that propel other vehicles to extreme speeds. Because interceptor drones are designed to destroy other drones at a low cost, Ukraine's manufacturers typically price them below $6,000 each.\n\nIt's another sign of how quickly the war is transforming the local weapons industry, which has turned hobbyist drones into some of the fastest yet cheapest aircraft on the battlefield. Four months ago, another Ukrainian interceptor drew widespread attention for reaching 195 mph in flight.\n\nUkraine is now ramping up ambitions to export such war technology, saying that its locally built missiles, drones, and anti-air systems have been tried and tested against Russia.\n\nA video posted by Fedorov on Tuesday said that producing drone motors in Ukraine \"seemed impossible\" just two years ago, but that Motor-G is now making 100,000 motors a month.\n\n\"Today, more and more drones are flying on motors made in Ukraine,\" the minister wrote.\n\nKyiv has been particularly focused on increasing the speed of its interceptors because Russia has been developing its own versions of the Iranian Shahed, which are long-range attack drones.\n\nThe most commonly used models of these loitering munitions fly at roughly 115 to 180 mph, and are often released in large numbers to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. The Russian tactic created the urgent need for Ukraine to develop cheap ways to destroy the Shaheds, which led to the rise of interceptor drones.\n\nHowever, Moscow has been repeatedly reported to be experimenting with smaller waves of new jet-powered Shaheds, which are believed to reach speeds of 230 mph.\n\nTheir emergence at the start of the year initially sparked fears in Ukraine that they would be too fast for interceptors to catch, though recent reports and war footage indicate that Ukrainian manufacturers have managed to close the gap.\n\nOne jet-powered Shahed, for example, was filmed being approached by a Ukrainian interceptor from behind in late November.",

    "title": "Aftermath Of Ukraine’s Underwater Drone Attack On Russian Submarine Seen In Satellite Imagery",
    "description": "Ukraine's submersible drone navigated into a protected harbor and detonated very close to the targeted submarine.",
    "fullText": "Satellite imagery is now available showing the aftermath of a Ukrainian attack yesterday on a Russian Navy Improved Kilo class diesel-electric submarine in the Black Sea naval stronghold of Novorossiysk. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed that this was the first attack against a Russian vessel using an uncrewed underwater vehicle (UUV). The operation could also mark the historic first successful use of a UUV as an anti-ship weapon, but the actual level of damage inflicted on the submarine remains unclear. Readers can first get up to date on the attack in our initial reporting here.\n\nTWZ obtained satellite images of where the attack occurred in Novorossiysk from Vantor (formerly Maxar Technologies). Additional imagery from Planet Labs has also been circulating online.\n\nThe satellite imagery confirms that the UUV — named by the SBU as a Sub Sea Baby, a previously unknown type — detonated off the stern of the submarine, which was at a pier in the port of Novorossiysk. A substantial chunk of the pier itself was destroyed in the attack. This all aligns with video footage shot during the attack from a position on the ground nearby, which the SBU released yesterday.\n\nСБУ вразила підводний човен рф у Новоросійську\n\nДеталі за посиланням\n\nhttps://t.co/2PjfguPVnMpic.twitter.com/pU2LIr7DP0\n\n— СБ України (@ServiceSsu) December 15, 2025\n\nThe post-strike imagery shows that the Improved Kilo class submarine, also known as a Project 636.3 Varshavyanka class type, is in the same position as it was before the attack. Two other submarines that were moored nearby when the attack occured have moved. Other submarines and ships are still in the moorings, including on the outside edge of the damaged pier.\n\nSome of the imagery available now suggests that the submarine that was attacked may now be sitting lower in the water, but that can’t be readily confirmed. Any damage below the waterline would also not be visible in the images. At the same time, there are also no clear signs of any emergency measures having been taken to keep it afloat, or to contain the leakage of oil or other potentially hazardous fluids, as one might expect to see if the damage was severe.\n\nBased on the estimated length of what is visible of the submarine, some observers have noted that the epicenter of the explosion looks to have been less than 65 feet from the stern. The size and configuration of the Sub Sea Baby’s warhead, as well as other details about the UUV and its capabilities, remain scant.\n\nSatellite imagery shows the aftermath of a strike by a Sea Baby underwater drone against a submarine pier in the port of Novorossiysk.\n\nAccording to the image, the strike occurred approximately 20 meters from the stern of a Project 636 Varshavyanka-class submarine, which remains… https://t.co/SVecegvkeD pic.twitter.com/fxOicR5AAW\n\n— OSINTWarfare (@OSINTWarfare) December 16, 2025\n\nTo note, the stern section of Kilo-class submarine remains submerged so presumably it was even closer than 20 meters.\n\nHighly probable that at least the propelled end got affected in a kinetic way.\n\n(satellite imagery I've used is not recent and used for illustration purposes… https://t.co/fwO0UldAZs pic.twitter.com/qxNHs2AEQf\n\n— Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@Archer83Able) December 16, 2025\n\nIt’s also worth noting that wider views of the port of Novorossiysk following the attack show four Project 636 submarines still present. There is nothing definitive to indicate that the targeted boat might have been replaced by another to conceal the extent of the damage.\n\nSatellite reveals that four Kilo-class submarines are docked at the Novorossisk port in Russia. One of them appears to have a slightly different waterline compared to the other three. Ukraine claimed that its underwater UV launched an attack on the area via Mizarvision #OSINT pic.twitter.com/k1DLtOcloL\n\n— GEOINT (@lobsterlarryliu) December 16, 2025\n\nFor its part, the Russian Ministry of Defense had unsurprisingly denied that any damage was inflicted on the submarine or to any personnel at the port. The ministry has released a video that it claims shows the undamaged boat, but does not offer a view of the stern end. The background is also heavily censored. Even so, it does still reveal what looks like piles of broken concrete debris left on the pier after the explosion, which was clearly visible in the SBU’s video of the attack, as well as in the satellite imagery available now.\n\nRussia shows footage of a Project 636.3 Improved Kilo-class submarine docked in the Novorossiysk Naval Base to deny Ukraine's claims about successful attack with an unmmaned underwater vehicle (UUV) on it. https://t.co/8molL3Fc2y pic.twitter.com/tECFkjknkM\n\n— Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@Archer83Able) December 16, 2025\n\nIt looks like there are piles of concrete debris left on the pier after the explosion. pic.twitter.com/h2NvDi0jkC\n\n— Capt(N) (@Capt_Navy) December 16, 2025\n\nThe press service of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which operates the submarine, also denies any damage to its vessels. This is also consistent with reports from various Russian naval monitoring channels on social media, but clear corroborating evidence has yet to emerge.\n\nOverall, at this stage, we still cannot say with any authority what degree of damage, if any, the submarine may have actually sustained.\n\nOn the other hand, the attack does show Ukraine was at least able to slip a UUV into a heavily defended harbor, in daylight, and detonate its warhead only a few dozen or so feet away from a prized Russian submarine worth, according to the SBU, around $400 million.\n\nAt least one Ukrainian UUV was therefore notably able to penetrate past barriers erected at the mouth of the port, intended specifically to protect the vessels within. It’s worth noting, however, that the defensive barriers Russia has already built around ports were primarily put there in response to Ukraine’s uncrewed surface vessel (USV) campaign. This underscores the significance of the use of a UUV in this attack, as another example of the steady adaptation of weapons systems and tactics in response to countermeasures that has become a particular hallmark of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nWith that in mind, Russia is likely to introduce new countermeasures against this particular mode of attack, one which Ukraine has spent some time developing.\n\nThe results of yesterday’s attack, while inconclusive for now, will likely spur further such developments in Ukraine, as well. Before SBU targeted the submarine in Novorossiysk, Ukraine had unveiled a UUV dubbed Marichka, designed to launch kamikaze attacks against ships and maritime infrastructure. At least one other Ukrainian UUV, known as Toloka, has previously been disclosed. It’s unclear if either of these has any relationship to the Sub Sea Baby.\n\nFurthermore, the attack confirms that the Black Sea Fleet is very much still a prime target for Ukraine. This applies especially to the submarines like the Project 636 types and corvettes that are able to launch Kalibr long-range cruise missiles. These weapons have been regularly used in Russia’s nightly barrages launched against targets across Ukraine.\n\nAlready, Ukrainian naval actions had forced the Black Sea Fleet to retreat from bases on the occupied Crimean Peninsula to Novorossiysk. Attacks in Crimea were also prosecuted against another Improved Kilo class submarine. In September 2023, the Rostov-on-Don was severely damaged during a combined missile and USV attack on Sevastopol. Ukraine later claimed it was destroyed.\n\nAt the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Black Sea Fleet had a total of six Project 636 submarines available.\n\nOther navies around the world will likely have watched yesterday’s attack with interest.\n\nAs well as the United States, China and many other nations are developing their own UUVs for missions like this one.\n\nUUVs are able to attack vessels and other targets at long distances and can be launched from submarines and motherships, further extending their range. They can also be used for surveillance and mine laying, among other duties. You can read more about these vessels in various TWZ stories here.\n\nUltimately, whether or not the Russian submarine was damaged, the attack has demonstrated once again that the war in Ukraine is a crucible for the development of new military technologies, especially uncrewed ones.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "fullText": "Newly captured satellite imagery shows the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone attack that targeted a Russian submarine at a naval base on the Black Sea.\n\nThe new imagery, captured on Tuesday by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and obtained by Business Insider, shows damage to a section of a quay at the port of Novorossiysk next to a Kilo-class submarine.\n\nUkraine's internal security agency said on Monday that it used underwater drones to strike a Russian submarine at the port in a first-of-its-kind attack. Kyiv published footage of the operation, which caused a large blast in the port, and said it damaged and disabled the boat.\n\nRussian state media, citing the Black Sea Fleet, said later on Monday that the attack failed to damage a submarine.\n\nThe satellite imagery does not appear to reveal any visible damage to a submarine; however, there could be some beneath the surface, making it difficult to determine the success of the operation.\n\nRussia's Kilo-class submarines — diesel-electric boats that have been in service since the 1980s — are used to carry out Kalibr cruise missile strikes against Ukraine, making them a high-value target for Kyiv.\n\nThe new imagery also reveals floating barriers at the entrance of the port, a tactic that Russia has used to protect its warships and infrastructure from Ukrainian naval drone attacks. However, this kind of defense is primarily aimed at surface threats, as the underwater drone was still able to enter the port and cause an explosion.\n\nUkraine has used its fleet of explosive-packed naval drones and long-range missiles to damage and destroy dozens of Russian warships and vessels since the start of the full-scale invasion.\n\nThis asymmetric campaign has forced Russia to relocate its Black Sea Fleet away from its long-held headquarters in the occupied Crimean peninsula to Novorossiysk, on the other side of the region. However, Ukraine continues to demonstrate that it can also target this port.\n\nThe attack, the latest against the Black Sea Fleet, appears to signal a new chapter in drone warfare. Ukraine has mainly relied on surface naval drones to target Russian warships.\n\nThe use of an underwater drone, compared to a slow-moving mine or torpedo, suggests a significant expansion of Ukraine's capabilities that could pose a new threat to the Black Sea Fleet.\n\nConflict analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, wrote in a battlefield assessment on Monday that Russia had docked its Kilo-class submarines in Crimea but moved them to Novorossiysk several years ago because of Ukraine's strike campaign.\n\nThe recent underwater drone attack \"shows that Ukrainian forces continue to modernize and optimize their unmanned capabilities such that Ukraine can strike Russian military targets at a range that Russian forces previously thought safe,\" the analysts said.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Monday slapped sanctions on five businessmen linked to Russian state-owned oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft and targeted companies accused of circumventing sanctions on Russian oil by running ships for Moscow's shadow fleet of aging oil tankers.\n\nOil revenue is a key part of Russia’s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the war effort against Ukraine without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.\n\nMember countries, notably France, have vowed to crack down on the sanction-busting shadow fleet which experts estimate numbers over 400 ships. They are also trying to secure deals with flag-carrying countries to make it easier to board the vessels.\n\nEU headquarters said the businessmen “control vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products, originating in Russia or being exported from Russia, concealing the actual origin of the oil, while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe four shipping companies targeted are based in the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Russia. A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",

    "fullText": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and 34 other countries formally approved plans Tuesday to create a compensation body to pay for damages to Ukraine caused by the Russian invasion, but questions remain about where the money will come from.\n\nZelenskyy told leaders gathered in the Dutch city of The Hague that he hopes for strong international support so \"any damage caused by the war can be compensated.”\n\nThe Council of Europe, the continent’s preeminent human rights organization, has facilitated the International Claims Commission, which will allow Ukrainians to seek compensation for “damage, loss or injury” caused by Russia since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022.\n\nThe Council of Europe is adamant that Russia must foot the bill, but there is no clear pathway for forcing Moscow to pay. One proposal is to use some of the tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe.\n\n“The aggressor must pay,” Zelenskyy told the Dutch parliament earlier Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, he attended peace talks in Berlin with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Zelenskyy voiced readiness to drop his country’s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia.\n\n“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he told journalists. “And this is already a compromise on our part.”\n\nThirty-five countries backed the International Claims Commission, but they now must ratify the treaty, a process which usually requires legislature approval. That level of support is unprecedented for the start of a Council of Europe treaty.\n\nThe commission will assess claims made to the already operational register of damages, which was launched during a Council of Europe summit in 2023. Some 80,000 claims have already been filed with the register, which is based in The Hague.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told a press conference the bloc would give one million euros ($1.1 million) to finance the commission's operation. An estimated 3.5 million euros ($4.1 million) are needed overall.\n\nMany of the same countries have also backed a new international court, also under the umbrella of the Council of Europe, to prosecute senior Russian officials for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.\n\nThe officials said talks with President Donald Trump’s envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, led to narrowing differences on security guarantees that Kyiv said must be provided, as well as on Moscow’s demand that Ukraine concede land in the Donbas region in the country’s east.\n\nTrump dialed into a dinner Monday evening with negotiators and European leaders, and more talks are expected this weekend in Miami or elsewhere in the United States, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly by the White House.\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump told reporters at an unrelated White House event. He added, “We’re having tremendous support from European leaders. They want to get it ended, also.\"\n\nThe U.S. officials said the offer of security guarantees won’t be on the table “forever.” They said the Trump administration plans to put forward the agreement on guarantees for Senate approval, although they didn’t specify whether it would be ratified like a treaty, which needs the chamber's two-thirds approval.\n\nIn a statement, European leaders in Berlin said they and the U.S. committed to work together to provide “robust security guarantees,” including a European-led ”multinational force Ukraine\" supported by the U.S.\n\nThey said the force's work would include \"operating inside Ukraine\" as well as assisting in rebuilding Ukraine's forces, securing its skies and supporting safer seas. They said Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.\n\nWitkoff and Kushner were accompanied by U.S. Air Force Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who heads NATO's military operations and the U.S. European Command, as talks honed in on the particulars of what the U.S. officials described as an “Article 5-like” security agreement. Article Five in the NATO treaty is the collective defense clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all.\n\nThe U.S. side presented the Ukrainians a document that spelled out in greater specificity aspects of the proposed U.S. security guarantees — something that Ukrainian officials said was missing from earlier iterations of the U.S. peace proposal, according to U.S. officials.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it a “truly far-reaching, substantial agreement that we did not have before, namely that both Europe and the U.S. are jointly prepared to do this.”\n\nQuestions over Ukraine's postwar security and the fate of occupied territories have been the main obstacles in talks. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil.\n\nZelenskyy on Monday called the talks “substantial” and noted that differences remain on the issue of territory.\n\nZelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine’s preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.\n\nUkraine has continued to reject the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control as a key condition for peace.\n\nThe U.S. officials on Monday said there is consensus on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan, and that Russia has indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the European Union, something it previously said it did not object to.\n\nThe Russian president has cast Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, however, as a major threat to Moscow’s security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nAsked whether the negotiations could be over by Christmas, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said trying to predict a potential time frame for a peace deal was a “thankless task.”\n\n“I can only speak for the Russian side, for President Putin,” Peskov said. “He is open to peace, to a serious peace and serious decisions. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.”\n\nPutin has denied plans to attack any European allies.\n\nRussia fired 153 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said 133 drones were neutralized, while 17 more hit their targets.\n\nIn Russia, the Defense Ministry on Monday said forces destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones overnight. An additional 16 drones were destroyed between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time.\n\nEighteen drones were shot down over Moscow itself, the defense ministry said. Flights were temporarily halted at the city’s Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports as part of safety measures, officials said.\n\nDamage details and casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.

    "description": "Ukraine has claimed to have blown up a Russian submarine using underwater drones for the first time.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine has claimed to have blown up a Russian submarine using underwater drones for the first time.\n\nThe submarine, which was carrying Kalibr cruise missiles and is estimated to cost close to £300m, was critically damaged after being hit in the Russian port city of Novorossiysk, according to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Monday.\n\nThe SBU did not specify the date or time of the attack. If verified, this would be the first time an underwater drone has hit a Russian submarine since the invasion began in 2022.\n\nRussia’s Black Sea Fleet said a Ukrainian attempt to attack the Russian naval base failed, according to news agencies.\n\n“Not &NoBreak;a single ‌ship ‍or submarine of the Black Sea Fleet located at ‍the base in Novorossiysk Bay &NoBreak;was damaged,” agencies quoted the Black Sea Fleet as saying on Monday. “There ‍were no injuries to crew.”\n\nVideo footage purportedly of the attack shows multiple Russian warships and a surfaced submarine, before there’s a sudden explosion in the water.\n\nThe clip has not been independently verified, but Reuters confirmed the location as Novorossiysk using the port’s layout and piers.\n\nThe SBU claimed the 636.6 Varshavyanka-class submarine, which “carried four Kalibr cruise missile launchers”, had been left effectively inoperable.\n\nReplacing it, considering international sanctions imposed on Moscow, would cost up to £370m, the SBU said.\n\n“The Security Service of Ukraine carried out another unique special operation and launched a naval attack in the port of Novorossiysk,” the SBU said in a statement.\n\n“For the first time in history, Sub Sea Baby underwater drones blew up a Russian... submarine.”\n\nUkraine’s upgraded “Sub Sea Baby” drones were unveiled in October, according to the statement.\n\nThe drones reportedly operate at distances of more than 1,500km and carry a payload of up to 2,000kg, around double the previous limit.\n\nAccording to Kyiv, they have previously been used to strike the support columns of the Kerch Bridge, which links Crimea with mainland Russia, and three sanctioned oil tankers linked to Russia’s “shadow fleet” in the Black Sea.\n\nDmytro Pletenchuk, the Ukrainian navy spokesman, told Reuters the operation to hit a submarine marked “another turning point” in the naval battle between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nAlexander Kamyshin, an advisor to ‍President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, ‌wrote on X that it was the first time in history that an underwater drone had neutralised a submarine. “I’ve been waiting for this day,” he said.\n\nThe Kalibr is one of the most modern and accurate cruise missiles in Russia’s arsenal. They are expensive and there are doubts about how many Moscow has left owing to difficulties procuring Western electronics.\n\nThe Varshavyanka submarine is known as the “Black Hole” because of the hull’s ability to absorb sounds and remain invisible to sonars.\n\nRussia is believed to have just 12 Varshavyanka submarines – six in its Black Sea fleet and six in its Pacific fleet, according to Ivan Stupak, Ukrainian military analyst and former SBU officer.\n\nHe added on social media that Novorossiysk is a heavily guarded port. “This is a real game-changer. As a result, one more Kalibr cruise missile carrier is lost and the potential total missile salvo against Ukrainian territory is slightly reduced,” said Mr Stupak.\n\nUkraine has become a world leader in sea drones and is thought to have carried out at least 13 attacks with them.\n\nKyiv has used them to attack Russian military ships and a naval base in Sevastopol, which forced Moscow to relocate its vessels from the Crimean port to the one in Novorossiysk.\n\nUkraine has stepped up its naval attacks in the Black Sea in recent weeks. Russia regularly strikes the Ukrainian port of Odessa.\n\nDrones have become a crucial part in Kyiv’s fight against Russia, as the devices are cheaper and quicker to produce than traditional weaponry.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Russia is now arming its drones with Soviet-era air-to-air missiles to hunt Ukrainian aircraft, Kyiv said.",
    "fullText": "A new kind of Russian drone armed with an air-to-air missile is being made using foreign parts, including some sourced from Western countries, Ukraine's military intelligence agency revealed on Monday.\n\nThe drone — a modified Geran-2 — was recently spotted in Ukraine carrying a Soviet-era missile, a first for this war. From the Ukrainian assessment, it's the latest Russian weapon to turn up with foreign components despite the sweeping international sanctions and export controls targeting Moscow.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence agency, the GUR, said that Russia has armed its Geran-2 drones with R-60 air-to-air missiles to fire at helicopters and aircraft providing air defense for Kyiv. Officials and analysts have delivered similar determinations about the purpose of the modification.\n\n\"The main purpose of the new development is to create a threat to Ukrainian military and tactical aviation, reducing the effectiveness of its work in intercepting enemy UAVs,\" the GUR wrote in a translated statement.\n\nThe GUR said that the modified drone contains foreign-made parts produced by companies in the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland, China, Japan, and Taiwan. Kyiv has frequently identified components in Russian weaponry sourced from these countries, some of which are among Ukraine's closest partners.\n\nRussia's defense ministry and its US embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the foreign parts assessments.\n\nDespite global sanctions, Western technology can still find its way into Russian weaponry via civilian markets, middlemen, or countries that sidestep export rules. Ukraine has repeatedly urged the international community to close those gaps and further isolate the Kremlin.\n\nIn one attack this fall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 100,000 foreign-made parts were discovered among 550 drones and missiles that Russia launched, underscoring just how massive the problem continues to be for Kyiv.\n\nRussia's introduction of a new Geran-2 — a one-way attack drone based on the Iranian Shahed-136 — armed with an air-to-air missile is notable, though it is not the first time in this war that drones have received these types of modifications.\n\nUkraine, for instance, has armed some of its naval drones with surface-to-air missiles, which have been used to shoot down Russian aircraft flying combat air patrols over the Black Sea.\n\nThe Shahed-style Geran-2 usually carries an internal warhead that explodes when the drone impacts a target. The R-60 missile — which entered service for Soviet fighter jets in the early 1970s and has a 6-mile range — may force Russia to limit the size of the payload, potentially reducing the drone's effectiveness in exchange for increased survivability.\n\nThe GUR said that the missile could be used if Russian operators saw a nearby Ukrainian aircraft or helicopters through cameras mounted on the drone and then ordered a launch. The R-60 features heat-seeking technology that enables it to home in on its target.\n\nThe new missile-armed Geran-2 comes as Russia continues to invest heavily in drone operations, including domestic production and the development of new launch sites.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine has hit Russian oil platforms in the Caspian Sea with long-range drones three times in a matter of days, a security source told Business Insider on Monday.\n\nIn the most recent attack, drones struck a platform at the Korchagin oil and gas condensate field, causing damage at the facility and forcing it to halt production, said the source in the Security Service of Ukraine, who was only authorized to speak anonymously to discuss sensitive military developments.\n\nThe drone attack is the latest against Russia's energy sector, a critical source of income for Moscow that helps fuel its war efforts in Ukraine. Kyiv has ramped up its deep-strike campaign on key oil and gas facilities and is now targeting infrastructure in the Caspian Sea, hitting activities there for the third time in less than a week.\n\nThe source in the SBU, Ukraine's main internal security agency, said that drones struck the Filanovsky oil production platform last Thursday, marking the first time Kyiv had caused damage to Russian oil infrastructure in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe following day, Ukrainian drones struck the Filanovsky platform again and also hit the Korchagin platform. The SBU source said that the attacks caused damage at both facilities and forced a suspension of operations.\n\nThe platforms are owned by Lukoil-Nizhnevolzhskneft, a subsidiary of the Russian energy giant Lukoil. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the drone attacks. Additionally, neither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe SBU source said that the agency is working to deny Russia the critical revenue from its energy sector, which helps finance the war in Ukraine. They said that the Filanovsky deposit is one of Russia's largest, with an estimated 129 million tons of oil.\n\n\"No Russian object working for the war is safe regardless of its location,\" the source said, according to a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\nThe repeated targeting of the two Caspian Sea oil platforms appears to signal a new shift for Ukraine as it continues to strike Russian oil and gas infrastructure.\n\nFor months, Ukraine has mostly carried out attacks against oil refineries, ports, and other facilities across Russia. However, in recent weeks, Kyiv has expanded these operations beyond land and intensified its strikes on maritime targets.\n\nJust before the three strikes in the Caspian Sea, Ukraine used its naval drones packed with explosives to attack three tankers allegedly belonging to the Russian \"shadow fleet,\" a collection of hundreds of vessels that Moscow uses to move oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the campaign against the Russian energy sector as \"long-range\" sanctions. The deep-strike campaign has been a bright spot for Kyiv in this war as Moscow's forces continue to make slow but costly gains on the battlefield.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has repeatedly urged its international partners to do more to prevent Russia from exporting oil and earning cash to fuel its invasion.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine carried out a first-of-its-kind attack on a Russian submarine using underwater drones, Kyiv said on Monday, revealing a new use for its explosive-packed uncrewed systems.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, said it executed a \"unique special operation\" using an underwater drone to strike a Russian Kilo-class submarine at the Black Sea port Novorossiysk, damaging and disabling the boat.\n\nThe SBU, Ukraine's main internal security agency, disclosed that the attack involved the employment of its \"Sub Sea Baby\" drones, which appear to be an underwater version of the Sea Baby naval drone Ukraine uses to target Russian surface vessels and port infrastructure.\n\nThe SBU said in a statement that the submarine was equipped with four launchers for Kalibr cruise missiles, which Russia regularly fires at Ukrainian cities.\n\nThe security agency did not specify when the operation took place, but it said it was carried out in coordination with the Ukrainian navy. The SBU published footage that appears to show the moment the underwater drone impacted the submarine, causing a large explosion.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe Kilo-class submarines are diesel-electric boats that have been in service since the 1980s. Russia has dozens of active subs, which make up one of the largest submarine fleets in the world.\n\nThe SBU said a Kilo-class submarine costs around $400 million, but the agency added that sweeping international sanctions would make it notably more costly for Russia to build a replacement.\n\nThe submarine attack marks the latest against Russia's naval force in the Black Sea. Since the start of the war, Ukraine has employed drones and missiles to damage and destroy dozens of warships and other vessels.\n\nThe asymmetrical campaign has forced Russia to relocate the bulk of its battered Black Sea Fleet from the long-held headquarters on the occupied Crimean peninsula across the region to Novorossiysk. However, Ukraine has demonstrated it can target Russian ships there as well.\n\nThe SBU said on Monday that the damaged submarine was in Novorossiysk due to the Ukrainian operations that drove the Russian Navy away from Crimea earlier in the war.\n\nMore significantly, the submarine attack appears to signal a new chapter in drone warfare. Ukraine has used naval drones, such as the Sea Baby, to strike Russian surface ships and used underwater drones to target Russia's \"shadow fleet\" vessels moving oil and circumventing sanctions.\n\nHowever, a strike on a submarine with what has been likened to a slow-moving mine or torpedo suggests an expansion of Ukrainian capabilities.\n\nBeyond Ukraine, Russia and NATO countries have actively developed their own underwater drone technology as militaries look to augment traditional naval capabilities with more uncrewed systems.",
