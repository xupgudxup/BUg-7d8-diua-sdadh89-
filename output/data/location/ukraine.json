    "description": "The Ratel Robotics' robot launches fiber-optic drones close to the front lines in Ukraine so operators can stay farther back and safer.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian arms company says it has modified one of its ground robots to carry and launch unjammable fiber-optic drones. Ukrainian forces can put the drones in the air closer to the front without exposing pilots.\n\nRatel Robotics shared a video this week of its Ratel H model robot equipped with a protected box. In the clip, the launcher opens up and releases a small drone connected to a fiber-optic cable. The uncrewed ground vehicle functions as a mobile launch point.\n\nCEO Taras Ostapchuk told Business Insider the \"ground robot becomes like a base station\" for the up to four drones that it can carry. Those bases are typically human-operated launch points, where pilots need to be closer to danger to put the drone in the air.\n\nOstapchuk said that the ground robot can drop off operators at a safe location and then continue toward the front to launch the drones. The operators remotely controlling it and the fiber-optic drones can hang back \"in the safest place possible.\"\n\nThe aim is that \"everything is as safe as possible for all people performing this mission,\" the CEO said.\n\nFiber-optic drones, which receive signals by a thin cable rather than radio links, have become central to the war because they can't be jammed by electronic warfare like other drones — though their range is limited and the cable can be cut or snagged.\n\nIt is unclear how many of Ratel Robotics' systems have been adapted for this mission or whether they are already in the field.\n\nDrone carriers are not necessarily a new concept. For instance, Ukrainian soldiers say Russia is using its medium-sized strike drones to fly smaller drones into battle like \"an aircraft carrier.\"\n\nGround robots account for only a small share of Ukraine's drone missions, but the technology is becoming more prolific.\n\nNew Ukrainian defense minister Mykhailo Fedorov said this week that Ukrainian forces carried out more than 7,000 combat and logistics missions with ground robotic systems in January. He added that production and upgrades are accelerating.\n\nUkraine uses its fleet of ground robots for many different missions, including carrying ammunition and gear, evacuating wounded soldiers, laying mines, demining, firing on Russian positions, and exploding near targets.\n\nThe Ratel H can carry more than 880 pounds and can travel more than 37 miles. The company says it is multipurpose, able to transport cargo and evacuate wounded soldiers. The robot can also be equipped with weaponry and electronic warfare systems.\n\nThe West is paying close attention to Ukraine's fight, seeking to learn lessons about what it would need to fight Russia.\n\nGround robots are drawing close scrutiny in the West. Western militaries have fielded similar systems, but not at this scale or across so many roles, and Ukrainian companies are pushing the technology forward.",

    "fullText": "TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Even now, safely in her new home of Estonia, Inna Vnukova says she can’t purge the terrifying memory of living under Russian occupation in eastern Ukraine early in the war and her family’s harrowing escape.\n\nThey hid in a damp basement for days in their village of Kudriashivka after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In the streets, soldiers waving machine guns bullied residents, set up checkpoints and looted homes. There was constant shelling.\n\n“Everyone was very scared and afraid to go outside,” Vnukova told The Associated Press, with troops seeking out Ukrainian sympathizers and civil servants like her and her husband, Oleksii Vnukov.\n\nIn mid-March, she decided that she and her 16-year-old son, Zhenya, would flee the village with her brother's family, even though it meant leaving her husband behind temporarily. They took a risky trip by car to nearby Starobilsk, waving a white sheet amid mortar fire.\n\n“We had already said our goodbyes to life, cursing this Russian world,” said Vnukova, 42. “I’ve been trying to forget this nightmare for four years, but I can’t.”\n\nMany Ukrainians like Vnukova fled the invading forces. Those who stayed risked being detained — or worse — as Russian forces eventually took control of about 20% of the country and its estimated 3 million to 5 million people.\n\nAfter four years of war, life in shattered cities like Mariupol and villages like Kudriashivka remains difficult, with residents facing problems with housing, water, power, heat and health care. Even President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged they have “many truly pressing, urgent problems.\"\n\nIn the illegally annexed regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Russian citizenship, language and culture is forced on residents, including in school lessons and textbooks. By spring 2025, some 3.5 million people in the four regions had been given Russian passports — a requirement to receive vital services like health care.\n\nSome in the regions say they live in fear of being accused of sympathizing with Ukraine. Many have been imprisoned, beaten and killed, according to human rights activists.\n\nOleksii Vnukov, a court security officer, stayed behind in the village for nearly two weeks. Russian soldiers twice threatened to kill him, including an instance where he and a friend were dragged off the street by soldiers. But he survived and soon also escaped the village.\n\nThe family traveled through Russia before making it to Estonia, where Inna works in a printing house and Oleksii, 43, is an electrician.\n\n“All life is leaving the occupied territories,” Vnukov said. “The people there aren’t living, they’re just surviving.”\n\nMykhailo Savva of the Center for Civil Liberties in Ukraine said the Russian military's practice of wielding “systemic and total control” in the regions continues today.\n\n“Even though a significant number of socially active people have already been detained, Russian special services continue to identify disloyal Ukrainians, extract confessions, and continue to detain people,” Savva said. “Residents face such practices as document checks, mass searches, and denunciations on a daily basis.”\n\nHuman rights groups say Russian authorities used “filtration camps” to identify potentially disloyal individuals, as well as anyone who worked for the government, helped the Ukrainian army or had relatives in the military, along with journalists, teachers, scientists and politicians.\n\nStanislav Shkuta, 25, who lived in occupied Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, said he narrowly escaped arrest several times before reaching Ukrainian-controlled territory in 2023. He recalled being on a bus that was stopped by Russian soldiers.\n\n“It was horrific. Men and women were asked to strip to the waist to see if they had Ukrainian tattoos,” said Shkuta, who now lives in Estonia. “I turned white with fear, wondering if I’d cleared everything on my phone.”\n\nHe said his friends who stayed in Nova Kakhovka say life has worsened, with suspected Ukrainian sympathizers stopped on the street or in surprise door-to-door inspections.\n\n“Today, my friends complain that life there has become impossible,” he said.\n\nRussia established a “vast network of secret and official detention centers where tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians” are held indefinitely without charge, said Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Center for Civil Liberties.\n\n“Everyone knows that if you end up in the basement, your life is worth nothing,” she said.\n\nRussian officials have refused to comment on past allegations by U.N. human rights officials that it tortures civilians and prisoners of war.\n\nAbout 16,000 civilians have been detained illegally, but that number could be much higher because many are held incommunicado. said Ukrainian Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets.\n\nA U.N. report released last summer said that between July 2024 and June 2025, it spoke to 57 civilians who were detained in the occupied regions, and that 52 of them told of severe beatings, electric shocks, sexual violence, degradation and threats of violence.\n\nOne particularly famous case is that of Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roshchyna, 27, who disappeared in 2023 while reporting near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and died in Russian custody. When her body was handed over to Ukraine in 2025, it bore signs of torture, with some of her organs removed, a prosecutor said.\n\n“Russia uses terror in the occupied territories to physically eliminate active people working in certain fields: teachers, children’s writers, musicians, mayors, journalists, environmentalists. It also intimidates the passive majority,” Matviichuk says.\n\nAt the start of the war, Russian forces besieged Mariupol before the port city fell in May 2022. The Russian bombing of the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater on March 16 of that year killed close to 600 people in and around the building, an AP investigation found, in the single deadliest known attack against civilians in the war.\n\nMost of the city's population of about a half-million fled but many hid in basements, said a former actor who huddled for months with his parents, saying they were nearly killed by the Russian bombing.\n\nThe former actor, now in Estonia, spoke on condition of anonymity to not endanger his 76-year-old parents, still in Mariupol. They had to take Russian citizenship to get medical care, as well as a one-time payment equivalent to $1,300 per person as compensation for their destroyed home, he said.\n\nAs in other occupied cities, Russification is taking place in Mariupol, changing street names, teaching Moscow-approved curriculum in schools, using Russian phone and TV networks and putting the city in Moscow's time zone.\n\n“But even today, the threat of death has not gone away. Only those who have Russian passports can survive,″ the former actor said, adding that his parents have asked him not to send postcards in Ukrainian because “it could be dangerous.”\n\nPutin \"openly states that there is no Ukrainian language, no Ukrainian culture, no Ukrainian nation. And in the occupied territories, these words are turning into terrible practice,” Matviichuk said.\n\nBut not everyone opposes the Russian takeover in Mariupol. The former actor says half of the members of his old troupe now support the Kremlin and believe Kyiv “provoked the war.”\n\nHousing is a sore point in Mariupol, where the population is about half of what it was before 2022. New apartment blocks rose from the ruins, but rather than going to those who lost their homes, they are sold to Russian newcomers.\n\nSome who lost their homes have made video appeals to Putin. “You said we ‘don’t abandon our own.’ Do we not count as your own?” said one resident at a mass rally.\n\nAt least 12,191 apartments in Mariupol were added to a list of purportedly “ownerless” and abandoned flats to be expropriated in the first half of 2025. Thousands more are being seized elsewhere.\n\nMoscow is encouraging Russian citizens to move to the occupied regions, offering a range of benefits. Teachers, doctors and cultural workers are promised salary supplements if they commit to living there for five years.\n\nYears of war and neglect have saddled many occupied cities in eastern Ukraine with serious problems in supplying heat, electricity and water.\n\nThe northeastern city of Sievierodonetsk suffered significant destruction before falling to Russia in June 2022. Once home to 140,000 people, only 45,000 remain, mostly elderly or disabled.\n\nOnly one ambulance crew serves the whole city, and doctors and other health workers rotate in from Russian regions like Perm to work at its hospital, said a 67-year-old former engineer who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nBut she still supports “the great work Putin is doing,” because she was born and raised in the former Soviet Union.\n\nIn Alchevsk, a city in the Luhansk region, over half the homes have been without heat for two bitterly cold months. Five warming stations have been set up and utility companies said over 60% of municipal heating networks are in poor shape, without funds for repairs.\n\nEven a pro-Moscow politician, Oleg Tsaryov, has accused authorities of freezing “an entire city.” When the heating system failed in 2006, he noted on social media that Ukrainian authorities \"and the entire country stepped in to help and completely replaced the faulty equipment.” But after the Russian takeover, officials had “contrived to repeat this Armageddon scenario all over again,” he added.\n\nIn the Donetsk region, water trucks fill barrels outside apartment blocks — but they freeze solid in winter, said a resident who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared repercussions.\n\n“There's constant squabbling over water,” she said, adding that lines to get the precious resource are “insane,” and people who are away at work often miss the trucks' arrival.\n\nDonetsk residents wrote an appeal for Putin to intervene in what has become \"a humanitarian and environmental catastrophe.”\n\nPutin last year acknowledged the plight in the four regions.\n\n“I know how difficult it is now for the residents of the liberated cities and towns. There are many truly pressing, urgent problems,\" he said, marking the third anniversary of incorporating those areas into Russia. He cited the need for reliable water supplies and access to health care, among other issues, and said he has launched a \"large-scale socioeconomic development program” for the regions.\n\nMeanwhile, Inna Vnukova is building a new life in Estonia: She and Oleksii now have a 1-year-old daughter, Alisa. Their son is now 20.\n\nOnly about 150 people — including the couple's parents — remain in the village that once was home to 800, Vnukova said, adding that she would like to show her daughter the family's native Luhansk region someday.\n\n“We’ve been dreaming of returning for four years, but we increasingly wonder — what will we see there?” she asked.\n\nKatie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine's Winter Paralympics team will boycott the event's opening ceremony next month after Russian and Belarusian athletes were invited to compete under their national flags.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was announced six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will take part in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and snowboarding at the Milan-Cortina Games, which start on 6 March.\n\nBoth countries had previously been suspended from Paralympic competition after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with Belarus an ally of Russia.\n\nIn September, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) lifted its ban on athletes from the two countries competing at the Games.\n\nHowever, the IPC does not govern the six sports contested at the Paralympics and despite the individual bodies, including the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), refusing to lift their own bans, Russia and Belarus won an appeal to the Court of Arbitration of Sport against FIS.\n\nAs a result, athletes have been able to return to FIS competitions and the 10 Paralympians have been awarded bipartite commission invitations to compete in Italy.\n\nFollowing an announcement that Ukrainian officials would avoid the entire competition, the country's National Paralympic Committee now says team members will miss the opening ceremony.\n\nThe organisation has also made a \"demand that the Ukrainian flag not be used\".\n\nThe team will still compete in the Games and \"fight for the sporting victories of Ukrainian athletes\".\n\nEarlier this week in its response to criticism over the decision to allow the Russian and Belarussian athletes to compete, the IPC said it was a \"democratic organisation and the decision to lift the partial suspension of NPCs Belarus and Russia was taken by IPC member organisations at the 2025 General Assembly\".\n\nIt added: \"At this meeting nearly 180 of the IPC's 211 members were in attendance and voted on this matter. We have to respect the decision of our members who come from all over the world.\"\n\nIn its statement announcing the boycott, the National Paralympic Committee of Ukraine described the IPC's decision as \"shameful\" and that it \"completely contradicts the principles\" of the Games.\n\nBipartite commission invites are granted to individual athletes, rather than their international federation, and allow the participation of top athletes \"who may not have had the opportunity to qualify through other methods due to extraordinary circumstances\".\n\nThe IPC, with the support of international federations - in this case FIS - decides who receives the bipartite slots after receiving recommendations from the federation.\n\nUkraine has also been awarded bipartite slots in three sports.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Ukraine's popular ex-military chief has provided new details of a rift with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, threatening to deepen a long-simmering conflict between the ‌two wartime leaders amid new speculation around post-war elections.\n\nGeneral Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, who served as ‌Kyiv's top commander until February 2024 and is now its ambassador to London, told the Associated Press in an ​interview published on Wednesday that he felt threatened by a 2022 raid by security agents and blamed Zelenskiy for a major battlefield failure.\n\nThe remarks provide fresh context to a potential rivalry that has long gripped Kyiv's political class.\n\nOpinion polls have consistently shown Zaluzhnyi to be Zelenskiy's main challenger in any ‌future election, although he has ⁠never voiced any ambition to run for office.\n\nZelenskiy, facing U.S. pressure to quickly secure a peace deal in Russia's four-year war, has signalled his readiness ⁠to hold elections when fighting ends.\n\nHis office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Zaluzhnyi's remarks on the 2022 raid. In his nightly address on Wednesday, Zelenskiy did not directly ​comment on ​the AP interview but spoke of the importance ​of national unity and working together to ‌ensure Ukraine’s survival.\n\n\"Any other politics in Ukraine is absolutely unnecessary at present… Personal matters (are for) later,\" he said.\n\nSECURITY RAID, MILITARY MISMANAGEMENT\n\nSpeaking in London, Zaluzhnyi described how his office was raided in September 2022 by dozens of agents from Ukraine's SBU security service, which answers to Zelenskiy.\n\nZaluzhnyi said he then called Zelenskiy's chief of staff with a warning that he would deploy troops to ‌protect his command centre, having already called in reinforcements ​to Kyiv.\n\nThe SBU's press service told Reuters an address used ​by Zaluzhnyi as a covert post ​had been listed in an unrelated organised crime case, and that no ‌searches were carried out.\n\nZaluzhnyi also pinned the failure ​of a much-vaunted 2023 ​counteroffensive on Zelenskiy, saying he did not commit the necessary resources to the campaign.\n\nAimed at breaking Russian defences, it ended mostly in an embarrassing string of defeats for Kyiv. ​Zaluzhnyi said his original plan ‌to focus on a single axis had been overridden by Zelenskiy's order to push ​across much of the front line.",

    "description": "Western militaries often view new technology as precious and valuable. Ukraine shows that they can't afford to view small drones that way.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's large-scale drone war is pushing Western militaries to treat small drones less as high-end equipment and more as expendable ammunition that isn't meant to come back.\n\nUS Army and British Army officials, as well as a NATO veteran who volunteered to fight in Ukraine, told Business Insider that effective drone warfare requires sending large numbers forward — and accepting many will be lost as a routine cost.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the director of the US Army's new drone lethality course, told Business Insider that the conflict shows that \"if you're going to flood the zone with drones,\" especially in a combat situation where electronic warfare is heavy, \"you're going to lose a lot of drones.\"\n\nShe said it's a \"transition from the army of old,\" where a lost drone was \"a significant emotional event\" that was reported to senior leadership. In Ukraine, it's different. \"Drones go down all the time.\" There, losses are typically shrugged off, rather than investigated.\n\nThat shifting mindset is shaping how Western militaries train.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the British Army's 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards, told Business Insider that his battalion has changed its training to allow drones to be damaged or even destroyed to reflect battlefield realities. \"I absolutely think they need to be disposable because otherwise you're not training realistically,\" he said.\n\nJakub Jajcay, a former special forces member from Slovakia who fought in Ukraine, told Business Insider that if NATO militaries want to start using drones for real missions, they \"need to get used to the fact that they're basically expendable material more akin to ammunition or fuel or gasoline, things like that, rather than specialized high-end pieces of equipment that need to be looked after.\"\n\nHe said when he was serving in the military for his home country, \"drones were very specialized pieces of equipment.\"\n\nThe drones were fairly expensive, he shared, \"and there was always a sort of bureaucratic process\" in using them. Sometimes, only designated individuals were allowed to use the drones.\n\nIf something happened to a drone, \"that would've been a big problem in training. If we had lost a drone, somebody would've been in big trouble for that.\" The war in Ukraine shows how poorly that peacetime mindset fits large-scale combat.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has featured drones on an unprecedented scale. Ukraine says roughly 80% of its strikes are carried out using drones rather than other weapons. Many never reach their targets and are lost along the way, though.\n\nCheap drones worth several hundred dollars have destroyed weaponry worth millions. But many of them don't have any effect. A report last year from the UK's Royal United Services Institute said that \"between 60 and 80% of Ukrainian FPVs fail to reach their target, depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators.\"\n\nSome drones are jammed or disrupted by electronic warfare, while others are shot down or get their cables cut. Sometimes they're knocked out by soldiers on their own side.\n\nMany of the drones on the battlefield are single-use, designed to explode when they hit their target, but many of them are destroyed, damaged, or disabled before they even reach that point.\n\nJajcay said that even drones designed to be used again and again \"have a lifespan of maybe a few dozen missions at most.\"\n\nHe also said that drones failed \"all the time,\" and those losses were expected.\n\nThe US Army is recognizing and learning from these dynamics in Ukraine, as are other Western militaries, as they incorporate the idea that drones cannot be treated as overly precious assets into their drone warfare training and doctrine.\n\nMaj. Wolf Amacker, who leads the Army's Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider that out of the thousands of drones used daily, only around 30% of them hit their targets, while many others don't have a significant impact on their targets.\n\nThe Army is learning that lots of drones need to be sent forward.\n\nIrwin-Clark told Business Insider that the way the UK sees drones has also shifted. He said \"every time there's an iterative change in technology in the battlefield, everyone gets very excited about it and the ownership of that asset tends to be far too high.\"\n\nHe said that often when a new and powerful technology emerges, senior leaders will try to tightly control it, arguing that because there are only a handful available, only a select few should have the authority to decide when it's used. The assets are carefully protected, at least initially. Later on, trust is imparted to soldiers to handle technology previously in the charge of higher-ups.\n\nThat pattern, Irwin-Clark said, is \"exactly what's happening with drones.\"\n\nHis battalion wrapped the first drones it received years ago in bubble wrap, \"and we didn't fly them very often,\" he said. \"When we did,\" he continued, \"we made sure we flew in the middle of a field with nothing, no obstacles around.\"\n\nNow, his battalion is deliberately crashing its latest drone delivery into targets, while looking at how to make repairs. \"It really doesn't matter if we break them,\" Irwin-Clark said.\n\nThe US is coming at it the same way. Martin, who previously commanded a Gray Eagle drone company, said her course takes into account that \"drones crash. I'll say that to the day I die having owned drones as a commander: drones crash.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last year that the defense department needs to view small drones as consumables rather than \"durable property\" — more like ammunition than valuable equipment. It's a change that Jajcay described as \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nWestern armies were using various drones in warfare before Russia's invasion, often using them as surveillance platforms or tools for launching missile strikes. Small drones weren't used the way they're being used in Ukraine, but the US, UK, and others are learning drone lessons from the war.\n\nMartin said the ongoing conflict in Ukraine shows that even when you lose drones, it's ultimately \"still cheaper than employing missiles on specific targets.\" That's an equation the US Army can't totally ignore.\n\n\"They're cheaper, and you're not putting human lives in danger\" to carry out the mission, she shared. And the Army knows that \"they're going to crash. It's going to happen.\"",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian officials will boycott next month's Winter Paralympics after Russian and Belarusian athletes were invited to compete under their national flags.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was announced six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will compete in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and snowboarding at the Milan-Cortina Games, which start on 6 March.\n\nIn September, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) lifted its ban on athletes from the two countries competing at the Games.\n\nHowever, the IPC does not govern the six sports contested at the Paralympics and despite the individual bodies - including the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) - refusing to lift their own bans, Russia and Belarus won an appeal to the Court of Arbitration of Sport (Cas) against FIS.\n\nAs a result, athletes have been able to return to FIS competitions and the 10 athletes have been awarded bipartite commission invitations to compete at the Paralympics.\n\n\"Ukrainian public officials will not attend the Paralympic Games,\" said the country's sports minister Matvii Bidnyi.\n\n\"We will not be present at the opening ceremony. We will not take part in any other official Paralympic events.\n\n\"We thank every official from the free world who will do the same. We will keep fighting!\"\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Sport Glenn Micallef said he would also not attend the opening ceremony and called on others to \"take the same stand\".\n\nBoth countries were suspended from Paralympic competition after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with Belarus a close ally of Russia.\n\nA partial ban - allowing athletes to compete as neutrals - was introduced in 2023.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Johan Eliasch, the president of the FIS, told BBC Sport the decision to award bipartite places had \"not been easy\".\n\n\"What we're dealing with here is an issue that is divisive, where people have different feelings depending on where they come from. It's something that we have to respect,\" he said.\n\n\"Athletes can't choose where they were born. On the other hand, they can't be used for PR purposes in their home countries to promote the war.\n\n\"It's our duty to make sure that athletes are not weaponised for political purposes.\"\n\nSix athletes to compete under Russian flag at Paralympics\n\nBipartite commission invites are granted to individual athletes, rather than their international federation, and allow the participation of top athletes \"who may not have had the opportunity to qualify through other methods due to extraordinary circumstances\", among other factors.\n\nThe IPC, with the support of international federations - in this case FIS - decides who receives the bipartite slots after receiving recommendations from the federation.\n\nUkraine has also been awarded bipartite slots in three sports.\n\nIn an earlier statement, Bidnyi said the decision to award slots to Russia and Belarus was \"both disappointing and outrageous\", adding their flags \"have no place at international sporting events that stand for fairness, integrity and respect.\"\n\nEliasch added: \"It is difficult, and in our case in the end, the courts decided the outcome.\n\n\"Everything has been done by the book. We've had strict vetting schemes of the people who do participate to make sure they don't have any affiliation with the military, and it's important that we keep that up.\"\n\nUK culture secretary Lisa Nandy said the awarding of bipartite places to Russian and Belarusian athletes was \"completely the wrong decision\", while in a statement on Wednesday, the British Paralympic Association said it was the \"wrong approach\".\n\n\"ParalympicsGB has consistently supported the decision to suspend NPC Russia and NPC Belarus, however the IPC membership recently made the decision to reinstate them and we have to recognise that decision,\" it said.\n\n\"We have been clear throughout that we believe this is the wrong approach and the ban should have remained in place given the ongoing war in Ukraine. We continue to express our solidarity with the people of Ukraine and our friends at NPC Ukraine.\"\n\nResponding to Nandy, the IPC said: \"The International Paralympic Committee is a democratic organisation and the decision to lift the partial suspension of NPCs Belarus and Russia was taken by IPC member organisations at the 2025 General Assembly.\n\n\"At this meeting nearly 180 of the IPC's 211 members were in attendance and voted on this matter. We have to respect the decision of our members who come from all over the world.\"\n\nRussian news agency TASS reports that among the athletes set to compete are Aleksey Bugaev, a three-time Paralympic champion in alpine skiing, and cross-country skiers Ivan Golubkov and Anastasiia Bagiian - both are World Championship medallists.\n\nAll three returned to competition in January, and both Bugaev and Bagiian have since won World Cup titles.",

    "description": "The twin attacks mark the latest deep strikes by Ukraine's security service as Kyiv hunts down Russian military and energy targets.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine carried out long-range drone attacks overnight against a key Black Sea oil terminal and a plant making components for explosives located deep inside Russia, a security official told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe twin attacks mark Ukraine's latest long-range strikes and come as Kyiv's forces continue to target facilities inside Russia that directly and indirectly help the country sustain its full-scale invasion.\n\nDrones struck the Tamannaftogaz oil terminal in Russia's Krasnodar region, hitting one of the largest ports in the Black Sea region, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.\n\nThe attack on the port, the second in less than a month, caused a fire at the facility, the source said, adding that the earlier Ukrainian drone strikes on January 22 damaged several tanks and pipelines at Tamannaftogaz, causing an estimated $50 million in losses. The facility is recognized as an important piece of Russian oil logistics in the Black Sea.\n\nThe source said that the SBU, Ukraine's main internal security agency, \"systematically\" targets Russia's energy and export infrastructure, striking at a major revenue source fueling Moscow's war efforts against its neighbor.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has intensified its long-range drone attacks on Russia's energy sector, striking oil refineries, terminals, tankers, and platforms across the country, and in the Black, Caspian, and even the Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have repeatedly described the deep-strike campaign as \"long-range sanctions\" on Moscow. The attacks have led to a slight decline in Russian oil refining over the past year.\n\nThe deep strikes have also targeted other infrastructure associated with Russian military operations, including factories, weapons storage facilities, and air bases.\n\nOvernight, for instance, Ukrainian drones struck the Metafrax Chemicals plant in the Perm region more than 1,600 kilometers (roughly 1,000 miles) inside Russia.\n\nThe sanctioned plant — one of the largest producers of methanol in Russia and Europe — is used to make chemical components for explosives and other military-related materials, the SBU source said. Several blasts were reported at the facility.\n\nIn a translated statement, the source said \"the SBU continues to systematically work on enterprises that provide the Russian military-industrial complex with raw materials and components for the production of weapons.\"\n\n\"The destruction of such objects reduces the pace of ammunition production, complicates the supply of resources for the army, and directly affects the reduction of the intensity of hostilities against Ukraine,\" they added.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to a request for comment on the attacks. Moscow said its air defenses shot down 334 Ukrainian fixed-wing drones over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe two attacks overnight on Monday were carried out by the SBU's Alpha group, an elite unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces.\n\nThe Alpha group is regularly behind long-range drone attacks against Russian targets. Forces within the unit also carry out ground operations, including in eastern Ukraine's embattled Donetsk region.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that it had carried out an attack on the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar region, which is not far from the Tamannaftogaz terminal that the SBU targeted.\n\n\"The defense forces of Ukraine will continue to systematically carry out measures aimed at weakening the combat potential of the Russian aggressor,\" the military said in a statement published to the Telegram messaging app.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Anastasia Kucherova, a Russian living in Milan, voiced her opposition to Russia’s war against Ukraine with a highly symbolic, if anonymous, act: Carrying the Ukraine team placard during the opening ceremony of the Milan Cortina Winter Games.\n\nKucherova was swathed in a long, hooded silver puffer coat, her eyes covered with dark glasses — like all the other placard bearers for the 92 nations competing in the Olympics. The Ukraine sign was illuminated for the crowd to read.\n\nAt first the country assignments were going to be random, but later the choreographer asked if the volunteers had preferences, and Kucherova chose Ukraine.\n\nKucherova, an architect who has been living in Milan for 14 years, was unrecognizable, and her nationality was not announced to the public when she led the five Ukrainian athletes competing in Milan into San Siro stadium to resounding cheers.\n\nShe first revealed her role to her 879 Instagram followers and then in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\n“When you walk by the side of these people you realize they have every human right to feel hatred towards any Russian,’’ she told the AP on Monday. “Still, I think it’s important to do even a small action to show them that maybe not all the people are thinking the same way.\"\n\nFor Kucherova, speaking about her small act of resistance on the second anniversary of the poisoning death of dissident Alexei Navalny is a way of reminding the world that the war continues, even as life elsewhere goes on.\n\n“Ukrainians don’t have any possibility to avoid these thoughts or to ignore the existence of war. So it is their reality. They keep loving each other, getting married or doing sports, coming to the Olympics. But all of this is happening (against) a devastating background.”\n\nWithout being told that Kucherova was Russian, the athletes immediately recognized her origins and addressed her in Russian. That was a sign for Kucherova of “some profound connection” between Russians and Ukrainians “that obviously could live on if not for the war.”\n\nThe Milan delegation was led by flag bearer Yelyzaveta Sydorko, a short track speedskater, and included figure skater Kyrylo Marsak. Both athletes have fathers who are fighting on the front lines in a war that is nearing its fourth anniversary.\n\n“There is literally no word you can say that can undo the harm that these people have already suffered, and there is no word that can come in close to forgiveness,’’ said Kucherova.\n\nRight before walking into the stadium, “I turned around — I didn’t know what to say to them — but I just said that the entire stadium is going to give them the standing ovation.’’ The Ukrainians appeared skeptical, she said.\n\nWhen the cheers came, Kucherova said it felt like the entire stadium was “recognizing their independence, recognizing their will for freedom, their courage in making it all the way to the Olympics.”\n\nShe cried, silently, behind her glasses.\n\nKucherova hasn't visited Russia since 2018, but understands that she is taking a risk by defying the regime.\n\n“I have to be worried about this, and I’m supposed to be scared about this. And I cannot guarantee that me speaking out will not harm any people I know,’’ she said. “But what I think is that if I, living in a democratic country and enjoying all the freedoms, if I am scared, this means that the regime has won.”\n\nKucherova held the sign for another delegation, Denmark, which also received a rousing ovation for that nation's resistance of U.S. threats to take over Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory.\n\n“Yes, this is a coincidence, but I pondered over it,” Kucherova said.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

He said he was standing near St Sophia's Cathedral, which could not be seen behind him because of Russian attacks.\n\nHeraskevych criticized the International Olympic Committee (IOC), saying more and more Russian athletes were returning to international arenas, \"while Ukrainians continue to live through a humanitarian catastrophe caused by Russian shelling.\"\n\n\"When the IOC plays along with Russian propaganda, it effectively becomes complicit in these crimes,\" he wrote.\n\nHeraskevych was disqualified shortly before the start of the skeleton events at the Winter Olympics in Italy after refusing to remove a helmet that had been banned by the IOC. The helmet featured images of more than 20 athletes who have died since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nIn an expedited procedure, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld the decision by the sport's governing body, the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF).\n\nAccording to the guidelines of the Olympic Charter, athletes are prohibited from making political statements during an ongoing competition. Heraskevych argues that the gesture is a commemoration rather than a political statement, something he says other athletes have been allowed to do.",

    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Monday it completed a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of North Korean soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, the latest effort by leader Kim Jong Un to honor the war dead.\n\nState media photos showed Kim Jong Un walking through the new street — called Saeppyol Street — and visiting the homes of some of the families with his increasingly prominent daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, as he pledged to repay the “young martyrs” who “sacrificed all to their motherland.”\n\nIn recent months, North Korea has intensified propaganda glorifying troops deployed to fight in Russia’s war against Ukraine, such as establishing a memorial wall and building a museum. Analysts see it as an effort to bolster internal unity and curb potential public discontent.\n\nKim in recent months has sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment, including artillery and missiles, to fuel Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, as the leaders align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington.\n\nSouth Korea’s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers last week it estimated 6,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded during their deployment in the war, but did not provide a breakdown of fatalities. The agency said last year it believed roughly 600 had died.\n\nThe spy agency believes North Korean forces are gaining modern combat experience and Russian technical support that could improve the performance of their weapons systems, according to lawmakers who attended last week’s closed-door briefing.\n\nThe construction of the new street comes as North Korea prepares to open a major ruling party congress later this month, where Kim is expected to announce his major goals in domestic and foreign policy over the next five years and take further steps to tighten his control.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Few figure skaters at the Winter Olympics have seen Adeliia Petrosian compete in real life.\n\nShe might leave with the gold medal.\n\nRussia's exclusion from international sports events during its war with Ukraine means that the 18-year-old Petrosian has only skated one senior competition outside of her homeland, the qualifier that earned her place as a neutral athlete in Milan.\n\nAs she readies to skate to Michael Jackson's music in the short program Tuesday, no one besides Petrosian and her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze, can be sure of her form, or whether she's injury-free.\n\nBut if Petrosian can get past skaters like the U.S. “Blade Angels” trio of Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito, and Japanese stars Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai, she'll shoot to sudden fame as the fourth consecutive Olympic champion from Russia.\n\nPetrosian is the latest star produced by Tutberidze, who revolutionized women's skating a decade ago by getting young girls barely in their teens to perform bigger and bigger jumps, only to have many of them struggle with repeated injuries.\n\nShe coached 2018 gold medalist Alina Zagitova, and a trio of standouts in 2022, when Anna Shcherbakova won the gold medal.\n\nBut the Beijing Games have been remembered less for Shcherbakova's triumph and more for the positive doping test turned in by another Tutberidze talent, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva. The case ended ultimately in a doping ban for Valieva that only recently ended, and an investigation into Tutberidze, though it found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Russian coach.\n\nTutberidze also was criticized for her harsh words toward her students in Beijing, while World Anti-Doping Agency president Witold Bańka said last week that he didn't “feel comfortable with her presence” at the Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nAs part of the fallout from the Valieva case, the International Skating Union increased the minimum age from 15 to 17 for senior-level athletes. That means Petrosian is one of the oldest women's skaters that Tutberidze has coached at a major championship.\n\nPetrosian has landed quadruple jumps in Russian national events, much like her compatriots were able to do in previous Olympics, and none of the other skaters at the Milan Cortina Games are able to match those high-scoring elements.\n\nThe big question is whether she's fit enough to do it in Milan.\n\n“I can't turn properly,” Petrosian complained in a Russian documentary following Tutberidze released last week. Tutberidze said Petrosian had been making progress in a difficult program around the new year, but suddenly “everything hurt.”\n\nThere's been no indication of how Petrosian's condition may have changed in the last month as she readied for the Olympics.\n\nFitness has been a factor for months. Tutberidze previously told Russian media that Petrosian wanted to give up her place in September's Olympic qualifier for lower-ranked skaters after an injury but ended up competing because the Russian alternate's fitness was worse.\n\n“Let's imagine it's just Chelyabinsk.” That was the advice Russian skater Petr Gumennik got from his coach ahead of skating in the men’s event, to pretend that the Olympics were happening in that provincial Russian city.\n\nFor a few seconds, it felt as if the competition might indeed be happening in Russia.\n\n“When I went out there I got so much applause, there was such noise, you can't compare it to anything,” Gumennik said after skating in the short program, where he was 12th. “That's Olympic support. It was unexpected and it gave me strength and confidence.”\n\nGumennik was greeted by fans waving personalized banners with his face, calling out “well done” in Russian.\n\nThere also was a Russian flag in the stands, even though Olympic organizers have barred it from the Games, where athletes such as Gumennik and Petrosian were vetted for any support of the war before they were allowed to compete as neutral athletes.\n\nAs the Russian with the best chance of a gold medal at these Olympics, there may be even more support when Petrosian skates. ___\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "In this post, we discuss how the ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a significant decline in the amount of IPv4 address space announced by Ukrainian Autonomous Systems (ASes), and why those addresses are often now being announced by western ISPs and major public clouds.",
    "fullText": "In this post, we discuss how the ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a significant decline in the amount of IPv4 address space announced by Ukrainian Autonomous Systems (ASes), and why those addresses are often now being announced by western ISPs and major public clouds.\n\nThe internet of Ukraine, noted for its resilience in the initial months following the Russian invasion, has been profoundly affected by three years of war. One notable change has been the exodus of a vital national commodity: IPv4 addresses.\n\nIn this blog post, we highlight several cases in which large amounts of IPv4 space, formerly originated by prominent Ukrainian ASes, have moved out of the country (often with the help of IPv4 brokers) to dozens of new origins, including major cloud providers, hosting operations, and international telecoms. The result is a dramatic reduction in Ukraine’s footprint in the global routing table — a new consequence of a protracted war in the digital age.\n\nUsing the top 100 retail providers in Ukraine listed in Kentik Market Intelligence, we observed an 18.5% decline in the amount of announced IPv4 space between February 2022 and May 2025.\n\nBut before we get into the various examples of Ukrainian providers leasing out their IPv4 resources around the world, we should mention up front that there are many providers that have not participated in this practice and are originating exactly the same (or very nearly the same) routes as they did before the Russian invasion in 2022.\n\nThe top Ukrainian providers that did not change are listed below, ranked in descending order by the equivalent number of /24s of IPv4 they originated in February 2022:\n\nUkrtelecom (Укртелеком) is the incumbent telecommunications company of Ukraine and is represented in the global routing table by the ASNs 6849 and 6877. In the past three years, the amount of IPv4 address space announced by these ASes has dropped dramatically, with much of the lost IP space migrating out of the country, if not the region entirely.\n\nAS6849 is the primary ASN for Ukrtelecom, which has experienced a marked decline in the amount of IPv4 space it originates in the past three years. AS6849 went from originating the equivalent of 4,728 /24s to only 1377 — a decline of 71%.\n\nWhile much of the decline in originated address space is no longer routed at all, a significant portion of the decline is now originated by various companies outside of Eastern Europe. In fact, there are currently over 100 ASNs that originate IPv4 space announced by AS6849 three years ago.\n\nWho is announcing Ukrtelecom IPv4 space? 92 /24s of IPv4 space are now originated by AS174 (example 91.124.96.0/22), 77 /24s are announced by AS16509 (ex: 91.124.133.0/24) and even AT&T (AS7018, example 91.124.2.0/24) announces 29 /24s. Below is a screenshot from the bgp.tools web utility showing the address range originated by AS7018 and registered to Ukrtelecom. Even passive DNS for this prefix echoes a previous life with the Ukrainian incumbent.\n\nIf we do a whois on this range, we can see that it is currently registered as “ATT-CT.” The highlighted fields indicate that IPv4 broker IPXO (AS834) had a hand in leasing this IPv4 space to a new customer, who is now getting the route originated by AS7018.\n\nPictured below, Ukrtelecom’s sister ASN (6877) experienced an even more dramatic decline over the past three years. On Feb 1, 2022, AS6877 originated 38 prefixes equivalent to 616 /24s of IPv4 space. Now, AS6877 has all but disappeared from the global routing table (except as the contents of an AS-SET for a couple of prefixes).\n\nIn November 2024, this IPv4 space began getting originated by numerous ASes outside of Ukraine. At present, there are over 50 unique origins for these IPv4 ranges including familiar ASNs like 7018 (ex: 46.203.225.0/24), 3356 (ex: 46.203.68.0/22), 174 (ex: 46.203.81.0/24), 5511 (ex: 46.203.86.0/24), 6461 (ex: 46.202.84.0/24), 3257 (ex: 46.202.56.0/24), and 7029 (ex: 46.203.6.0/24).\n\nIn response to an inquiry about the leasing of IPv4 space, a representative of Ukrtelecom confirmed to me that this was an action taken to raise funds during an ongoing war.\n\nYes, this was a necessary step taken during wartime to secure financial stability and continue delivering essential services to our customers.\n\nLeasing out a portion of our IPv4 resources allowed us to mitigate some of the extraordinary challenges we have been facing since the full-scale invasion began.\n\nAt the same time, Ukrtelecom remains committed to maintaining and expanding internet infrastructure across Ukraine, especially through fiber rollout, which remains our strategic priority.\n\nWe appreciate the attention to this issue and are open to further dialogue on how Ukrainian telecoms are adapting in these unprecedented times.\n\nOlena Shramko\n\nPR Director\n\nUkrtelecom\n\nAccording to published rates from IPv4 brokers, a /24 (256 addresses) can be leased for $100–$150 per month. Based on the analysis above, Ukrtelecom is leasing the equivalent of 1500 /24’s (~1000 from former AS6849 IPv4 space and another ~500 from AS6877). If we assumed the low end of that price range, that would be US$150,000 (or ₴6,288,00) of additional revenue per month for the country’s national operator.\n\nIn another example, AS43310 began 2022 originating 3 prefixes equivalent to 24 /24s of IPv4: 91.225.224.0/22, 91.197.4.0/22, and 188.191.96.0/20. By November 2022, things had begun to change as this address space began to be parceled out to over a dozen new origins, with AS7018 currently the primary origin for these former Ukrainian IPv4 ranges.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, AS34092 was originating 6 IPv4 prefixes equivalent to 58 /24s of IP space until the beginning of March that year, when it disappeared from the routing table. Some routes were shifted to sister AS, 57033, but by June 2022, the address space was being farmed out to numerous ASes.\n\nAS57033, for its part, began 2022 by announcing 21 IPv4 prefixes equivalent to 48 /24s of IP space (some overlapping with AS34092). But by December 2024, AS57033 disappeared as well and now all of IPv4 space originated by these two ASNs in 2022 is now originated by 37 ASNs including AS8075 (ex: 81.22.128.0/24), AS7018 (ex: 81.22.129.0/24), AS3320 (ex: 109.72.116.0/24), and AS16509 (ex: 31.43.161.0/24).\n\nIn my blog post from February 2023 about the Russification of IP registrations, I highlighted a route (151.0.0.0/20) originated by AS45025, which had its country field updated from “UA” to “RU” in July of 2022 as part of a larger effort to assimilate newly Russian-held territories.\n\nIn fact, the RIPE database has been altered as well. Below is the output of a whois command I ran in 2023 that was featured in the blog post.\n\nIf you were to run the same command today, you would get a message saying that the object was deleted on April 4, 2024. The evidence of the prior existence as a prefix of Ukraine has been purged from the records.\n\nWell, AS45025 no longer exists in the global routing table. The IPv4 space it was originating in 2022 has been divvied up among providers in the Russian-held region of Donetsk, as well as a few global telecoms such as AS7018 (ex: 93.89.216.0/24), AS5511 (ex: 91.193.252.0/24), and AS2914 (ex: 93.89.218.0/24).\n\nDepicted below, AS42430 was a service provider based in the Lugansk region of Ukraine, along the front lines of battle between Ukrainian and Russian forces. The ASN disappeared from the global routing table in March 2022, and with it, the seven prefixes equivalent to 37 /24s of IPv4. In September 2022, parts of these ranges began to be originated by new origins, including Bursabil Teknoloji (AS60721), a Turkish IPv4 broker.\n\nIn 2023, IPv4 broker IPXO, and US telecom icons Sprint and AT&T were among the origins for the former Lugansk IPv4 space. Still, the primary origin that emerged for these IPs was Paltel (AS12975) of the Palestinian Territories, which currently originates nearly all of it. According to RIPE NCC’s published transfer statistics, 188.0.112.0/20 and 188.0.96.0/20 were transferred from Byte-SD to Paltel on January 6, 2023.\n\nAS43554 was a service provider operating in Mariupol, originating the equivalent of 259 /24s of IPv4 at the beginning of 2022. Trinity went offline in early March of 2022 during the bloody siege of the city.\n\nJust like with the previous example, IPv4 space previously originated by AS43554 started to be originated by as many as 54 ASes outside of Ukraine. This phenomenon continued until the beginning of 2024, when a large portion of the address space was consolidated into Ukrainian content provider Sweet (AS204384).\n\nDuring the summer of 2023, I noticed some of Trinity’s IPv4 space being originated by AT&T (screenshot below).\n\nIn fact, one of the address ranges had been registered as “AT&T Services, Inc.” in a likely attempt to use it for a residential proxy.\n\nCyberintelligence firm Spur summarizes the problems posed by proxy services this way:\n\nResidential proxies have long been used for illicit activity on the internet, including web scraping, scalping tickets to your favorite concerts, pushing spam to forums and social media, new account fraud and account takeovers. It involves hijacking what otherwise is legitimate infrastructure, allowing bad actors to mask their actual IP addresses with those associated with genuine customers your business would otherwise welcome.\n\n“Residential proxies” are so named because they utilize IP addresses that an Internet Service Provider has assigned to a household, as opposed to a business or datacenter. This makes them appear more legitimate and allows them to evade detection by legacy geolocation and fraud services or IP quality score providers like MaxMind or Transunion (formerly Neustar).\n\nI brought this to a contact at AT&T and within a few weeks it was gone.\n\nAlso based in Mariupol, AS24881 was originating six prefixes equivalent to 76 /24s of IPv4 back in 2022. As illustrated below, AS24881 and the IPv4 space it originated disappeared from the global routing table in March of that year.\n\nAS24881’s IPv4 space wouldn’t be seen again until February 2023 when it was originated by Linknet (AS57460), a service provider based in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in the Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast. During 2023, this address space was originated by as many as 20 different origins, as is illustrated below.\n\nIn May 2022, Russian forces rerouted internet service to the occupied southern city of Kherson through Miranda-Media (AS201776) in Russian-occupied Crimea. I detailed the switchover in a blog post and in a collaboration with The New York Times that landed on the front page of the newspaper.\n\nThe first provider in Kherson to make the switch to Russian transit was SkyNet (aka KhersonTelecom, AS47598), whose owner took to Facebook to explain his rationale for reconnecting his service through Russia. “On April 30, EVERYTHING fell!” he said, adding that he had no choice but to “turn on the circuit of the Crimean operator Miranda.” While some local residents thanked him, others accused him of using “enemy internet”, a decision he defended in the post.\n\nIn November 2022, Ukrainian forces retook Kherson Oblast above the Dnieper River, and most providers switched back to using Ukrainian transit to connect to the global internet. It was at that time that AS47598 disappeared from the global routing table. In April 2024, the one prefix (91.206.110.0/23) that had been originated by AS47598 in 2022 reappeared as originated by NTT (AS2914), where it continues to be announced today.\n\nIn April 2025, KhersonTelecom transferred its three IPv4 ranges (including 91.206.110.0/23) to a new owner. All three are hosting proxy services according to cyberintelligence firm Spur.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, I published the first analysis of the emerging private market for IPv4. The analysis was the basis for our talk at RIPE 70 in Amsterdam that year. Following years of debate on the matter, the RIPE NCC created a process for facilitating the sale of IPv4 space, creating a new player in the internet ecosystem: the IPv4 broker.\n\nOne of the first IPv4 brokers to emerge was a Romanian outfit so prolific that roughly half of the transfers recorded by RIPE that year were from that country alone. In fact, the footprint of the Romanian internet in the global routing table shrank by a quarter in 2015 as every bit of the country’s IPv4 space that wasn’t being actively used was sold off — mainly to Saudi Arabia and Iran, which was the subject of my collaboration with the Washington Post later that year.\n\nSomething similar has been happening to Ukraine’s footprint in the global routing table, but for different reasons. Weary from years of missile strikes and aerial bombardment, conditions are tough in many parts of the country. If leasing out parts of their IP resources keeps the business afloat and employees paid, who can blame these providers?\n\nBut questions arise. Are IPv4 brokers taking advantage of the situation by leasing out so much of Ukraine’s IPv4 space? Or are the brokers vital “to secure financial stability” for Ukrainian ISPs? Who is responsible when these ranges are used for various proxy services that cause problems on the internet?\n\nAt APRICOT in 2024, APNIC Chief Scientist Geoff Huston asked whether we have reached peak IPv4, citing a recent decline in the amount of routed IPv4. In another talk (slide 6), he cited the decline in the market price for IPv4, theorizing that perhaps demand was waning as IPv6 was utilized more (or NAT was becoming more acceptable). But another reason could be that the market is being flooded with supply from Ukraine.",

    "description": "Russia still has many air defenses, and experience it gained against Ukraine actually makes them a bigger threat to NATO aircraft than before 2022.",
    "fullText": "Russia's air defenses may pose a more significant threat to NATO air forces than they would have before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a top air defense analyst warned in a recent report.\n\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has been able to destroy numerous Russian air defense systems.\n\nJustin Bronk, an air power expert at the UK's Royal United Services Institute, warned that not only does Russia still maintain a large arsenal, but it is also still producing its most powerful systems. And its ability to use these weapons has improved through combat experience.\n\nSystems have been upgraded, crews have more experience, and Russia has become better at coordinating their use with surveillance aircraft to accurately extend their reach.\n\nRussia's surface-to-air missile systems, Bronk wrote, \"not only remain numerous, but are also likely to perform better against NATO aircraft and munitions in a hypothetical direct conflict than they would have before 2022.\"\n\nFacing this challenge, NATO could struggle to sweep aside Russian air defenses in a European war to achieve air superiority — a cornerstone of Western airpower doctrine.\n\nHe told Business Insider in an interview about the report that Russia's forces are \"much more experienced\" and have \"learned quite a lot through trial and experimentation.\"\n\nA strictly air-to-air clash pitting Russian air forces against NATO aircraft likely wouldn't go well for Moscow, Bronk predicted, but a war wouldn't only take place in the air.\n\nBefore Western jets could operate freely, European air forces would likely need to suppress or destroy Russia's dense network of ground-based air defenses. Their volume and improved coordination could pose a serious challenge.\n\nUkraine has been able to achieve a \"steady drumbeat\" of strikes against Russian defense systems with weaponry like drones, artillery, and missiles, Bronk said, but there are still \"several hundred batteries\" in service, with more modern variants continuing to roll off production lines.\n\nBronk's analysis is based on interviews with Western air forces and ministries, data from Ukraine's armed forces, and open-source information.\n\nHe said his findings indicate that Russia's array of ground-based integrated air defence systems \"remains a highly potent threat to NATO air capabilities in a European context.\"\n\nThe sheer volume is a problem for NATO in Europe. \"The primary threat to NATO air power\" is Russia's extensive ground-based surface-to-missile coverage, he said.\n\nNATO notably doesn't have a similar arsenal.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has underscored how decisive ground-based air defenses can be. Russia began the war with the largest such arsenal in Europe, followed by Ukraine, and that scale has helped prevent either side from establishing air superiority.\n\nNATO has committed to increasing its arsenal of ground-based air defenses in response, with alliance defense spending soaring, but it's not a problem that can be quickly solved.\n\nBoth Russia's combat aircraft crews and surface-to-air missile system operators are \"significantly more combat-experienced and more capable overall than they were prior to the start of the full-scale invasion,\" Bronk said.\n\nThe increase in operator experience alongside hardware and software upgrades \"a least partially offsets\" some of the significant attrition that Russian SAM systems have suffered during the war against Ukraine.\n\nImprovements to the force include new tactics and procedures, software updates to improve the performance of radars, better resistance to electronic warfare, and bringing new pieces of hardware into service.\n\nNew hardware includes the S-350 Vityaz, a medium-range surface-to-air missile system that first entered service in 2020.\n\nRussia's forces are also getting better at working together, Bronk said.\n\nHe said that in a direct conflict with NATO forces in Europe, the threat to NATO aircraft \"would be far better coordinated today than they were prior to 2022.\"\n\nUkraine has reported that since mid-2023, Russia's long-range surface-to-air missiles have more frequently coordinated engagements with fighter jets near the front lines and A-50U airborne early warning and control aircraft, allowing them to fire at Ukrainian aircraft \"at ranges that the surface-to-air systems could not have been able to directly observe by themselves.\"\n\nRussia could use similar strategies in a conflict with NATO, \"to engage Western aircraft flying at low altitudes at longer ranges,\" Bronk said.\n\nIn Ukraine, he said, the probability of scoring a kill with one of these shots \"almost certainly remains low,\" as they require the missile seeker to find the target without mid-course guidance.\n\nBut the evolved tactic points to how much more skilled Russia's air force and air defense crews have become, compared to their less coordinated tactics in the early months of the war.\n\nAt the same time, NATO's air forces have \"access to significantly more detailed and accurate data on the strengths, weaknesses, tactics and technical characteristics of Russian SAM systems than they had before 2022,\" Bronk said. That can't be understated.\n\nThey understand the threat of Russia's ground-based air defenses better. And the weaponry and tactics to counter them do exist, Bronk said, \"albeit not in sufficient numbers in Europe yet.\"\n\nUltimately, Bronk said, \"Russian air defence capabilities have been boosted by combat lessons over almost four years of operations,\" and that could require more from NATO to break through in a fight.",

    "description": "Patriot interceptors, made by the American company Lockheed Martin, are Ukraine's top defense against Russian ballistic missile attacks.",
    "fullText": "Russia often mixes up how it attacks Ukraine with ballistic and cruise missiles — from firing decoys to tweaking trajectories midflight — and Kyiv says it's funneling that battlefield intel to US Patriot interceptor makers to inform upgrades for better performance.\n\n\"They are trying to use different tactics and make some adjustments for their ballistic missiles,\" Yehor Cherniev, the deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, said of the Russian strikes.\n\nHe shared with Business Insider in an interview this week that Ukraine is relaying information about the strikes to the manufacturers of the Patriot interceptors — specifically, the PAC-3 missiles made by the American defense giant Lockheed Martin — so that the company can make adjustments to its munitions.\n\nA Lockheed Martin spokesperson declined to comment on foreign military activities but said that it is boosting production of its top Patriot interceptor while \"accelerating upgrades to counter evolving threats.\"\n\nCherniev characterized these efforts as a \"race of technologies.\" Ukraine and Russia are scrambling to gain a decisive edge over the other on and off the battlefield.\n\nUkraine's military operates only a handful of MIM-104 Patriot batteries, which are widely regarded as the best surface-to-air missile system Ukraine has to defend against Russian ballistic missile attacks. One PAC-3 (Patriot Advanced Capability-3) interceptor costs $3.7 million, making engagements costly, particularly if an interceptor fails to eliminate its target.\n\nA US intelligence assessment released in August said that Russia had upgraded its ballistic missiles, enhancing their maneuverability. This created additional challenges for Ukraine's Patriot batteries.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have repeatedly called on Western countries to send more Patriot batteries to Kyiv, along with interceptors like the advanced PAC-3.\n\nInterceptors are in high demand globally. To meet US expectations, Lockheed plans to triple its annual production of PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptors over the next few years.\n\nWestern partner nations have sent other surface-to-air missile batteries to Ukraine, such as the SAMP/T system developed by France and Italy, but Cherniev said Patriots are the most effective defense against Russia's ballistic missiles.\n\nEchoing Zelenskyy, the lawmaker stressed that Ukraine doesn't have a \"sufficient amount\" of Patriot batteries and interceptors, but, he shared, \"the situation is a little bit better than it was in the beginning of this year.\"\n\nRussia uses various tactics to overwhelm and confuse Ukraine's air defenses, including launching missiles in multiple waves and changing their trajectory in the terminal phase to make them more difficult to intercept, Cherniev said. Several Russian missiles, such as the Kinzal and Iskander, have terminal maneuverability.\n\nTo exhaust Ukrainian air defenses, Russia also launches cruise missiles and drones without warheads, he added. The latter is a fairly common tactic.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to Business Insider's request for comment on its tactics.\n\nUkrainian officials have identified air defense systems and missiles as the most important weapons they need from the West.\n\nThe US was the single biggest provider of security assistance to Ukraine under the Biden administration, and it sent tens of billions of dollars in weaponry to Kyiv during the first three years of Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nSupport has declined since President Donald Trump took office a year ago; however, the State Department continues to approve foreign military sales for Ukraine, including for Patriot-related equipment.\n\nEuropean countries have stepped up to fill the gap, providing roughly $30 billion in military aid in 2025, according to a new report issued by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\n\nIn July, the NATO alliance announced the Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, designed for allies to purchase military hardware from US stockpiles for Ukraine. Countries have already committed billions of dollars to the effort.\n\nSince the PURL initiative began, NATO member states have supplied around 75% of all interceptors for Ukraine's Patriot batteries and 90% of the missiles for other air defense systems, Mark Rutte, the alliance's secretary general, said last week.",

    "fullText": "Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill says \"there are no easy games\" in the Nations League after being drawn with Hungary, Ukraine and Georgia.\n\nThe campaign begins with a quadruple-header from 23 September until 6 October, and two final matches in November.\n\nBefore starting their Nations League campaign, Northern Ireland travel to Italy in March for a World Cup play-off semi-final as they look to reach the tournament for the first time since 1986.\n\nO'Neill's side secured that play-off, and promotion to League B, by winning their League C group in 2024 and the manager says it's an \"exciting draw.\n\n\"The Nations League has proven to be a very competitive and valuable competition for us,\" he said.\n\n\"We will aim to approach every game with ambition, to be difficult to play against, and to give our supporters performances they can be proud of.\"\n\nEngland to face Spain and Croatia in Nations League\n\nNorthern Ireland famously beat Ukraine at the Euro 2016 finals but lost a friendly between the sides in 2021.\n\nIn a disappointing year, Hungary were relegated from League A and also missed out on a World Cup play-off following a dramatic defeat by the Republic of Ireland in November.\n\nGeorgia, whose star player is PSG's Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, beat Armenia in a play-off to remain in League B.\n\n\"It's a competitive group - there's no doubt about that,\" O'Neill added.\n\n\"At this level there are no easy games and we fully respect the challenge that lies ahead.\n\n\"We have faced Ukraine in recent years but haven't beaten them since 2016, so there's familiarity there\n\n\"Georgia are perhaps the unknown quantity for many, but that doesn't make them any less dangerous.\n\n\"Hungary are a well-organised, physical side with quality throughout the team and strong home support, which always makes for a tough test.\"\n\nFormer Northern Ireland defender and BBC Sport NI pundit Stephen Craigan said the \"draw could have been a lot worse\" and it would be realistic for O'Neill's side to avoid relegation.\n\n\"We've got more than enough in our locker to be competitive,\" he added.\n\n\"If we could stay in League B after this campaign I think everyone would be pleased and see it as progress.\n\n\"I think stability, which would be staying in League B. You can carry that experience forward.\n\n\"Getting relegated would not be the end of the world, but when you work so hard to get that promotion you want to try and maintain it as much as you can.\"\n\nCraigan admitted it was a positive Northern Ireland had earned promotion to League B and playing at the highest level possible would help a young squad.\n\nHe also pointed to last year's World Cup qualifiers, and said the side's away form was an area they could improve despite some strong performances.\n\n\"You are going to be playing against better teams and going to tougher venues,\" added Craigan.\n\n\"It will put the younger players under a bit of stress, but that's how they learn and progress.\n\n\"The next stage is to maintain a strong level of performance but get results off the back of them, particularly away from home.\n\n\"Our record away from home hasn't always been great, so that's the next challenge for this young group, to be more competitive.\"",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian long-range drones struck an oil refinery nearly 1,100 miles into Russia, marking one of Kyiv's deepest strikes of the war, a security official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nThe drones struck the Ukhta refinery in Russia's Komi Republic, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe source said the targeted refinery is located 1,750 kilometers (1,087 miles) from the Ukrainian border, in what was Kyiv's latest strike on Russian energy infrastructure.\n\nThe attack on Thursday triggered a fire at the refinery. Plumes of smoke are visible in footage of the facility shared by the SBU source. One video shows what appears to be a large Ukrainian drone streaming across the sky. Business Insider could not independently verify the imagery.\n\nThe refinery is part of Russia's state-owned PJSC Lukoil Oil Company, and it processes about 4 million tons of oil annually. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which confirmed the attack, said the facility supplies Moscow's military.\n\nThe General Staff wrote on the Telegram messaging platform that \"other components\" of Ukraine's defense forces were involved in the attack.\n\n\"The SBU continues to carry out targeted strikes on the enterprises of the Russian oil refining complex, which ensure the functioning of the military machine of the aggressor country,\" the security service source said in a translated statement.\n\nHitting such targets \"reduces the enemy's ability to provide their troops with fuel, complicates logistics, and reduces financial revenues that go to the war against Ukraine,\" they said.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said that it shot down 211 fixed-wing Ukrainian drones over the past 24 hours, but it did not specify where. Neither the ministry nor the country's embassy in the US immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has intensified its long-range drone attacks on Russian energy facilities, hitting oil and gas infrastructure on land, such as refineries and ports, as well as tankers and platforms in the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the campaign targeting Russia's energy sector as \"long-range\" sanctions on Moscow, which uses the revenue from this industry to fuel its full-scale invasion.\n\nYehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, told Business Insider earlier this week that striking the Russian energy sector has been \"one of the best decisions\" because \"it is painful for them.\"\n\n\"I think that's why they have a problem in their economy and with the financing of the war, actually, of their armed forces,\" he said. \"We have to continue to do this.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian deep strikes have affected Russia's oil sector. Refining has declined over the past year; Moscow processed 5.3 million barrels a day last month, compared with the 5.6 million barrels it usually processes in January, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has stepped up its missile and drone barrages on Ukrainian energy infrastructure this winter, causing blackouts in cities around the country and leaving civilians without heat, electricity, and water.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that Russia used 219 drones and 25 missiles to attack the country during the previous night, killing multiple people in an attack primarily aimed at energy infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities.\n\nUnited Nations officials have called this winter Ukraine's coldest in over a decade.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian skeleton pilot Vladyslav Heraskevych says being banned from competing at the Winter Olympics is the \"price of our dignity\".\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has banned Heraskevych for continuing to wear a helmet featuring images of athletes killed during Russia's invasion of his home country, which the IOC says breaks its rules.\n\nHeraskevych, who wore the helmet in all of his training runs before the competition began on Thursday, was told by the IOC on Tuesday it \"does not comply\" with the Olympic charter and that he was not allowed to wear it.\n\nIOC president Kirsty Coventry visited the 26-year-old at Cortina's sliding track at 07:30 local time on Thursday before the first skeleton heat in a final attempt to convince him not to wear the helmet in competition.\n\nBut the IOC said Heraskevych \"did not consider any form of compromise\".\n\nIt said: \"The IOC was very keen for Mr Heraskevych to compete. This is why the IOC sat down with him to look for the most respectful way to address his desire to remember his fellow athletes who have lost their lives following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe IOC added that Heraskevych, who was considered to have an outside chance of a medal based on his training times, had been banned for contravening athlete guidelines, rather than because of displaying political propaganda.\n\nResponding on social media after being banned, Heraskevych wrote:, external \"This is [the] price of our dignity.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, he added: \"I could be among the medallists in this event, but suddenly because of some interpretation of the rules which I do not agree with, I am not able to compete while other athletes in the same situation were able to compete, and they didn't face any sanctions.\"\n\n'Shocking' or correct - why Ukraine skeleton slider was banned\n\nThe IOC said he was banned for contravening the 'athlete expression' guidelines, which were drawn up in 2023 and are part of Olympic law.\n\nThey state that: \"The focus at the Olympic Games must remain on athletes' performances, sport and the harmony that the Games seek to advance.\n\n\"It is a fundamental principle that sport at the Olympic Games is neutral and must be separate from political, religious and any other type of interference.\n\n\"Specifically, the focus on the field of play during competitions and official ceremonies must be on celebrating athletes' performances.\"\n\nHeraskevych, who said he felt \"emptiness\" at not being allowed to compete, said the ban was not consistent with other decisions taken at the Games.\n\n\"'Expression guidelines', I believe it's a very big term. What do you consider as 'expression'? Many athletes here have helmets with different paints [colours] and I believe it's also a kind of expression,\" he said.\n\n\"Some athletes have national symbols, it's also an expression but for some reason their helmets were not checked. They are allowed to compete, but I am not.\"\n\nHeraskevych insists his tribute is no different to those that other athletes have displayed, such as figure skater Maxim Naumov.\n\nThe American held up a photo of his parents, who were among 67 people killed in a plane crash in Washington DC just over a year ago, while waiting for his score to be announced on Tuesday.\n\nHeraskevych's accreditation for the Games was initially withdrawn by the IOC but, following a \"very respectful\" conversation with the committee's president Coventry, that decision was overturned and he will be allowed to remain at the event but not compete.\n\nAsked how strongly he felt about commemorating those who have been killed during the Russian invasion, Heraskevych said: \"I believe they deserve to be here because of their sacrifice. I want to honour them and I want to honour their families.\"\n\nHe explained that many of those pictured on his helmet were athletes, including teenage weightlifter Alina Peregudova, boxer Pavlo Ishchenko and ice hockey player Oleksiy Loginov, and some of them were his friends.\n\nThe IOC said earlier this week that Heraskevych could pay tribute to the fallen athletes by wearing a black armband during competition and could show his helmet in mixed zones, news conferences and on social media, but that \"the field of play is sacrosanct\".\n\nIt added that IOC officials would \"beg\" him not to wear it as they wanted him to compete.\n\nOn Thursday, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that if the committee allowed athletes to wear kit commemorating those killed in war, it would open the Games up to exploitation.\n\n\"There are according to the Red Cross, 130 conflicts going on at any one time. We can't have them all in competition [with each other at the Games],\" he said.\n\n\"The field of play could become a field of expression, you could see it would lead to chaos. We cannot have athletes put on them by political masters to make expressions during competition.\n\n\"We do our best to create a level playing field, I make no apologies for that.\"\n\nAdams said IOC president Coventry had left the meeting with Heraskevych in tears as she felt \"very emotional\" about the matter, adding that \"the meeting was good, personal and respectful\".\n\nHe also denied that the IOC had been pressured by either the Russian Olympic Committee or the Russian government to ban Heraskevych, and said the Ukrainian would have access to a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) commission should he wish to appeal.\n\nThe IOC said athletes are able to \"express grief with dignity and respect\" at multi-faith centres in the Olympic villages.\n\nIt added that Heraskevych has been \"supported by the IOC for the last three editions of the Games\" and that he is an Olympic scholarship athlete.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the IOC also set up a solidarity fund for Ukrainian sport to support the athletes' preparations for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,\" it said.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "The biggest controversy of the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics came to a head on Thursday morning, as Ukraine's Vladyslav Heraskevych was banned from competing.\n\nHeraskevych, who was his country's flagbearer at the opening ceremony, wished to compete in the men's skeleton while wearing a special helmet featuring artwork depicting Ukrainian athletes killed during the Russian invasion.\n\nBut the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said this contravened the Olympic charter – the rules and bylaws for the organisation of the Games – and informed him on Tuesday that he would not be allowed to compete in the helmet.\n\nAfter two days of discussions in which Heraskevych refused to back down, it was confirmed on Thursday morning that he had been disqualified.\n\nHeraskevych wore the helmet in all his training runs before the competition began and carried it through media mixed zones and in multiple interviews.\n\nBut IOC rules dictated that he would not be allowed to wear it during official competition.\n\nThey cited rule 40.2 of the Olympic Charter, external, which states: \"All competitors, team officials or other team personnel in the Olympic Games shall enjoy freedom of expression in keeping with the Olympic values and the fundamental principles of Olympism, and in accordance with the guidelines determined by the IOC Executive Board.\"\n\nThese are the athlete expression guidelines, external, determined in 2023 and which have been codified into Olympic law.\n\nThis states that: \"The focus at the Olympic Games must remain on athletes' performances, sport and the harmony that the games seek to advance.\n\n\"It is a fundamental principle that sport at the Olympic Games is neutral and must be separate from political, religious and any other type of interference. Specifically, the focus on the field of play during competitions and official ceremonies must be on celebrating athletes' performances.\"\n\nThey say athletes can express their views during Olympic Games when speaking to the media, on social media, and on the field of play at the start of competition or during their introduction.\n\nHowever, they forbid these expressions during medal ceremonies, during competition and in the Olympic village.\n\nIf these rules are broken, participants \"may be subject to the IOC's disciplinary proceedings.\"\n\nThe IOC said these changes have been agreed after consultation with 4,500 athletes – stating that the focus on the field of play must be on the sport.\n\nIt was initially erroneously claimed by the IOC that it was rule 50 - which states that \"no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites\" - that resulted in the disqualification.\n\nIOC president Kirsty Coventry visited Heraskevych and his father in Cortina at 7.30am on the morning of competition, to make a last-gasp plea for him to not wear the helmet.\n\nShe said they had a lengthy, respectful meeting – but ultimately no compromise could be reached.\n\n\"No-one is disagreeing with the messaging. The messaging is a powerful message of remembrance, it's a message of memory, and no-one is disagreeing with that,\" Coventry told the media.\n\n\"What I proposed to him this morning and to his dad - because he also said when he goes down it's blurry, you can't really see it - so I said: 'Could we find a solution where we pay homage to his message, to his helmet before he races, then as soon as he's finished racing going into the mixed zone where you can see the pictures?'\n\n\"Sadly, we've not been able to come to that solution. I really wanted to see him race today. It's been an emotional morning.\"\n\nCoventry was seen to be in tears after leaving the meeting. A former Olympian herself, she won two gold medals in swimming for Zimbabwe.\n\nThe IOC have also reinstated Heraskevych's accreditation, allowing him to stay around the Games and in the Olympic village for the remainder of the competition.\n\nIn a tense media conference on Thursday morning, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams defended their decision to ban Heraskevych.\n\nAdams said that if they allowed athletes to wear kit commemorating those killed in war, it would open the Games to exploitation.\n\n\"There are according to the Red Cross, 130 conflicts going on at any one time,\" he said. \"We can't have them all in competition with each other at the Games.\n\n\"The field of play could become a field of expression, you could see it would lead to chaos. We cannot have athletes have pressure put on them by political masters to make expressions during competition.\n\n\"We do our best to create a level playing field, I make no apologies for that.\"\n\nAdams also denied that the IOC had been pressured by the Russian Olympic Committee or government to ban Heraskevych.\n\nHeraskevych meanwhile has made an urgent appeal against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\n\nCAS can hold ad-hoc committees during the Games, meaning his appeal will be heard immediately - although BBC Sport understands there is currently no timeframe for a decision.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nThe decision to ban Heraskevych has drawn shock and condemnation from many former and current Olympic athletes.\n\nLizzy Yarnold, Team GB's two-time Olympic skeleton gold medallist, told BBC Sport: \"I think it is actually quite shocking. Within the sliding community there is shock and confusion.\n\n\"This [wearing the helmet] was a reaction to something which was an act of memorial and incredibly emotionally important to him.\n\n\"I think the IOC owe him an apology and this was the wrong decision.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic bobsledder John Jackson was equally unimpressed with the IOC.\n\nJackson, who also served as a Royal Marines commando, told the BBC: \"His approach to that is about remembering those who have fallen.\n\n\"For me, being military and now a veteran, remembrance is really important to all veterans. We have all lost friends and colleagues in conflict, and we all know someone who isn't here and paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n\"I support him in what he was trying to achieve. It is really important to remember those who have given their life for something that ultimately doesn't need to happen.\"\n\nHeraskevych meanwhile told the BBC that being banned only left him feeling \"emptiness.\"\n\n\"Yesterday and before yesterday I was training good. I could be among the medallists for this event, but suddenly because of some interpretation of the rules that I do not agree with, I am not able to compete,\" he said.\n\n\"Expression guidelines - what do you consider as expression? Many others here in this arena have helmets with different colours and I believe that is also a kind of expression.\n\n\"Some others had national symbols, that is also expression. For some reason, their helmets weren't checked and they were allowed to compete but I am not.\n\n\"I believe they [those who have fallen] deserve to be here because of their sacrifice. I want to honour them and their families.\"\n\nHeraskevych's international team mates showed their support throughout Thursday's competition in Italy.\n\nAlpine skier Dmytro Shepiuk displayed a note reading \"Ukrainian heroes with us\" after competing, while luger Olena Smaha also voiced support for Heraskevych wearing a glove reading: \"Remembrance is not a violation.\"\n\nUkraine president Volodymyr Zelensky accused the IOC of \"playing into the hands of the Russian aggressor\" after Heraskevych's disqualification\n\n\"Sport shouldn't mean amnesia, and the Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors,\" he wrote on X, external.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the decision of the International Olympic Committee to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych says otherwise.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Feb 10 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy assembled his top military officers on Tuesday to discuss shortcomings in air defence and other aspects of protecting civilians ‌from attack nearly four years into Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy, speaking in his ‌nightly video address, also assessed how local authorities in Ukraine's cities were tackling the aftermath of massive Russian ​attacks, particularly in ensuring high-rise apartments had power and heating. He again singled out for criticism officials in the capital Kyiv.\n\nZelenskiy said he held long discussions with the military's Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, the chief of the general staff, Andrii Hnatov, and Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.\n\n\"Many changes are ‌happening right now in the ⁠work of air defence. In some regions, the way teams operate, interceptors, mobile fire units, the entire small air defence component is being practically ⁠rebuilt completely,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n\"But this is only one element of defence that requires changes. Changes will happen.\"\n\nThe president has frequently pointed to improved air defences as critical to protecting ​cities from ​air attacks and has asked Kyiv's Western allies ​to provide more weaponry to knock ‌out incoming missiles and drones.\n\nLast week, with heating still not restored to hundreds of dwellings after air raids targeting energy infrastructure, he said defence lines in some areas were proving inefficient.\n\nEnergy Minister Denys Shmyhal, writing on Telegram after the daily meeting of officials on energy issues, said crews were working around the clock to restore heating in Kyiv, where night-time ‌temperatures were set to hit -19 Celsius (-2 Fahrenheit).\n\nAfter meeting with ​the top brass, Zelenskiy said Kharkiv and Poltava regions ​in central and northeastern Ukraine were ​also having difficulties with electricity, as well as parts of Odesa ‌region on the Black Sea.\n\nHe renewed criticism ​of decision-makers in Kyiv, ​where he has been at odds with Mayor Vitali Klitschko, as well as in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih and Okhtyrka near the Russian border.\n\n\"Every community leader and ​responsible service must pay real ‌attention to what is happening with buildings, with networks,\" he said. \"We are monitoring ​at all levels and people will be held personally responsible.\"",

    "description": "The war in Ukraine showed the US Army just how effective small drones can be. They can be more than scouts. They can be offensive weapons.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine showed the US Army just how effective small drones can be, not just as scouts, but as offensive weapons, officials told Business Insider.\n\nMaj. Wolf Amacker, who leads the Army’s Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider the service had a capability “gap\" due to having long viewed small drones primarily as tools for surveillance and reconnaissance.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine unlocked a world of new realizations with regard to drone warfare.\n\nFacing an existential crisis, the Ukrainians had to develop a way to counter hostile forces cheaply yet with mass. That meant figuring out how to turn inexpensive drones into weaponry, a step that quickly and fundamentally changed how the war was being fought. Now, drones carry out 80% of all battlefield hits and are responsible for most combat casualties.\n\nDrones had been used in warfare prior to Russia's invasion, but this is different. The dramatic shift in warfare has inspired Ukraine's partners, including the US, to up their training on drone warfare and production of small drones.\n\n\"We're still a very capable force as a US Army,\" Amacker said; however, \"there is a new capability that we just don't have fielded across the force yet.\"\n\nThat's changing though. The Army has been increasingly prioritizing small drone operations, using them the way that the Ukrainians do, to direct fire and drop grenades, among other actions. Drones are also an important part of the Army's major transformation initiative.\n\nCritical skills are now being taught at the Aviation Center of Excellence's Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course in Fort Rucker, which began last year and aims to train soldiers to lethally employ small drones in combat. This includes learning to pilot and attack, as well as use drones to support traditional fire missions with artillery.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the course's director, said that Ukraine has shown the US what it needs to learn.\n\n\"The eyes of the world are on the Russo-Ukrainian war and the tactics and equipment that are being utilized in that type of warfare,\" she said, explaining that \"in America, that is not a style of warfare that we're accustomed to, where we're heavily using robotics and unmanned systems in order to target in the near fight.\"\n\nShe said it's \"a doctrinal and tactical thing that we weren't prepared for a year ago, but we're rapidly getting better at it as we go through.\"\n\nUkraine uses small aerial drones, like first-person-view quadcopters, to gather intelligence on Russian troops and equipment positions, but also to directly attack soldiers and equipment. Those drones have killed troops, exposed defensive positions, and destroyed high-value systems such as tanks.\n\nUS military drones have long been mostly large, fixed-wing aircraft deployed for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering or armed strike. Those drones, systems like the MQ-9 Reaper or RQ-4 Global Hawk, are typically operated by the Air Force, rather than the Army, and they are expensive, millions of dollars each.\n\nMartin said Ukraine's battlefield experience showed the Army that inexpensive drones can destroy weapon systems worth millions of dollars. It's a capability the Army couldn't afford to ignore.\n\nThe Army is looking into restructuring combat units to prioritize drones as weapons, including creating new specialized, drone-led strike units.\n\nCol. Nick Ryan, who oversees US Army drone integration, explained to CNN in September that he wants soldiers to look at their drone \"as if it was their personal weapon,\" or their radio, their night-vision goggles, or a grenade.\n\nMartin said that the Army test units struggled early on simply learning to fly small drones. First-person-view drones, she said, \"require a high skill level,\" and many units weren't resourced for that initially.\n\n\"What we want is not just flying,\" she said, \"but employing those systems lethally.\"\n\nThat presents additional challenges. \"The lethal part is very complicated,\" Martin said, requiring risk management, approvals, and handling munitions that most soldiers don't regularly train with. \"So this course was created here.\"\n\nShe described lethal drone use as something infantry training has only begun to incorporate recently.\n\nPart of the training course emphasizes limits as well as capabilities. Martin said students are taught that drones are a tool, not a universal solution.\n\n\"Ultimately, drones are a tool,\" she said, \"but there are other tools available.\"\n\nUkraine turned heavily to drones in part because it lacks the substantial volume of traditional weapons needed to fight a larger military and has faced repeated shortages and delays in promised aid. Cheap, adaptable drones helped fill those gaps.\n\nThe US is not in the same position. With advanced airpower and other high-end systems supporting operations, the Army approaches drone warfare differently, integrating drones rather than relying on them as substitutes for other capabilities.\n\nThat said, the Army sees the potential and plans to buy at least one million drones within the next two to three years.\n\nIt also intends to grow the training program, which had its inaugural session in August, to teach more advanced tactics and complex scenarios and have graduates take their lessons back to their respective units and become trainers themselves.\n\nAmacker said that the goal is to teach drone warfare skills such that \"when we combine it with our full force of effects, it just complements everything we're doing. It makes us even more efficient and effective on the battlefield.\"",

    "description": "Sr. Lt. Serhii Andrieiev told Business Insider that the cold can disrupt anything from the drone's camera lens, to its battery, to its aerodynamics.",
    "fullText": "Extreme winter temperatures can pose an onslaught of technical challenges for drone operators on Ukraine's front lines, a local drone commander said as his country was hit by a cold snap.\n\nSr. Lt. Serhii Andrieiev, deputy commander of the \"Kraken\" drone company in the 3rd Army Corps, told Business Insider that the cold can heavily disrupt reconnaissance and first-person-view attack drones because their parts often aren't designed to withstand such conditions.\n\n\"Their behavior is unpredictable, how they will operate in the frost. It's a bit, kind of like Russian roulette,\" Andrieiev said. \"Will it work, or will it fall on the field?\"\n\nMany drones in Ukraine are built with off-the-shelf components ordered online. The freewheeling nature of the supply market means it's difficult to assess how consistently each individual part performs in the cold, Andrieiev said.\n\n\"These components are serially manufactured components. They are not mil-spec components. They are cheap, and well, most of them are from China,\" he said.\n\nHe said Ukrainian units have learned to adapt, but these issues can delay critical missions or add to mental strain for troops already dealing with harsh weather. Such challenges also imply risks for other militaries seeking to bolster their drone forces, especially as concerns grow that potential new wars may spill into the Arctic regions.\n\nAndrieiev was speaking as Ukraine had just experienced one of its coldest weeks since the full-scale war began. Average temperatures in the first week of February dropped to about -19°C, or -2.2°F.\n\nIn Kharkiv, where Andrieiev's troops are fighting, some nights registered temperatures as low as -6°F.\n\nAlmost every part of the drone is susceptible to such cold. For example, Andrieiev said, low temperatures can significantly reduce the voltage of its battery, causing it to die more quickly when used at full capacity.\n\n\"You can't predict the behavior of this battery. To switch on the drone, no problem. The problem starts when it flies and hits the maximum power of its battery,\" Andrieiev said.\n\nA bigger issue arises because the drone generates heat as it flies. When it's cold out, the temperature gap between the aircraft's internal structure and the environment puts stress on its electronics and motors.\n\nThe drone can also get wet through condensation, disrupting its wiring or fogging up its lenses. Even aerodynamics can be affected when frost and small icicles grow on the chassis or propellers.\n\nThe result can be frustrating for the drone pilot, Andrieiev said. Sometimes, they watch helplessly as their drone, still transmitting footage to their screen, crashes to the ground or into a tree because a component fails.\n\n\"You identify your target, you should hit the target. You prepare your drone, drone is starting, drone flying to target, and just in the middle of the flight, it falls to the ground. And that's it,\" he said.\n\nWhen his units receive drones that aren't working well in the cold, they typically return the entire batch to the manufacturer and request improvements.\n\nWhile Andrieiev said that quality issues are becoming \"much less of a problem\" for Ukrainian drone manufacturers, returning drones costs valuable time.\n\n\"It takes time, and you should have a buffer stock of those components and drones, so that you can replace it faster than the manufacturer,\" he said.\n\nOther equipment for attack drones, such as antennae, transmitters, or supporting relay drones that extend signals, can also fail. Hair-thin fiber-optic cables used to circumvent Russian jamming need to be high-quality to avoid damage from the frost as well, he added.\n\n\"The FPV drone is just one link, one element of this whole system,\" Andrieiev said.",

    "description": "\"Russia has to continue the war because this war is too big for Putin to fail.\"",
    "fullText": "The Kremlin’s financial situation is becoming increasingly dire and could come to a head in a matter of months as oil revenue shrinks while President Vladimir Putin shows no intention of ending his war on Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials have been warning Putin with growing alarm that a financial crisis could hit by the summer, sources told the Washington Post. They pointed to weak oil revenue, which crashed by 50% in January from a year earlier, and a budget deficit that continues to widen, even after Putin hiked taxes on consumers.\n\nA Moscow business executive also told the Post that the crisis could arrive in “three or four months” amid spiraling inflation, adding that restaurants have been closing and thousands of workers are getting laid off.\n\nThe economic strains go back to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine four years ago. As sanctions took hold and Putin mobilized the economy for a prolonged war, a tight labor market and high inflation forced the central bank to keep interest rates high. Recent easing has failed to prevent spending declines in several consumer categories.\n\nWith companies feeling the squeeze of high rates and weaker consumption, more workers not being paid, getting furloughed, or seeing their hours cut. As a result, consumers are having trouble servicing their loans, raising concerns of a crash in the financial sector.\n\n“A banking crisis is possible,” a Russian official told the Washington Post in December on condition of anonymity. “A nonpayments crisis is possible. I don’t want to think about a continuation of the war or an escalation.”\n\nIn June, Russian banks raised red flags on a potential debt crisis as high interest rates weigh on borrowers’ ability to pay off loans. Also that month, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs warned many companies were in “a pre-default situation.”\n\nThe Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting, a state-backed Russian think tank, said in December the country could face a banking crisis by October if loan troubles worsen and depositors pull out their funds, according to the Post.\n\n“The situation in the Russian economy has deteriorated markedly,” wrote Dmitry Belousov, head of the think tank, in a note seen by the Financial Times. “The economy has entered the brink of stagflation for the first time since early 2023.”\n\nRussia’s financial woes could become even more serious as Europe weighs additional sanctions on so-called shadow fleet tankers used to ship Moscow’s oil. That would add to recent U.S. penalties on Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\nThe West’s tighter sanctions regime has forced Russia to offer steeper discounts on its crude exports, while the recent slide in global oil prices has already hurt its top revenue generator.\n\nDespite the worsening fiscal outlook, Moscow is still spending heavily on weapons and incentives to lure fresh recruits to the army. To cover revenue shortfalls, Russia has tapped its sovereign wealth fund, but that is running out now too.\n\nRussia has also suffered staggering losses on the battlefield, with an estimated 1.2 million killed or wounded since the war began. Last month, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said more than 30,000 Russian troops died in December alone—an average of 1,000 each day—to gain only minimal territory.\n\nAt the same time, European officials have pointed out that Russia is losing strategically, with Ukraine likely headed for EU membership, NATO growing larger after adding new member states, and Europe ramping up defense spending significantly.\n\n“So people are saying that Russia wants to continue the war because they want more territory—that’s rubbish,” Finnish President Alexander Stubb said last month at the World Economic Forum. “Russia has to continue the war because this war is too big for Putin to fail. When you add on to that the Russian economy is in shambles, which means they’re not going to be able to pay their soldiers which means zero growth, end of reserves, interest rates and inflation in double digits. So Putin cannot afford to end this war. This is my big worry.”\n\nIndeed, while Russia has engaged in on-again, off-again talks to end the war, it continues to bombard Ukraine with missiles and drones, targeting its energy infrastructure.\n\nRussian, Ukrainian and U.S. officials just ended two days of talks in Abu Dhabi with little progress reported. In comments released on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the U.S. wants the war to end by June and plans a fresh round of negotiations.\n\n“America proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams—Ukraine and Russia—meet in the United States of America, probably in Miami, in a week. We confirmed our participation,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — It is pre-dawn in the historic Podil district of the Ukraine capital, Kyiv, and warm light from the Spelta bakery-bistro’s window pierces the darkness outside. On a wooden surface dusted with flour, the baker Oleksandr Kutsenko skilfully divides and shapes soft, damp pieces of dough. As he shoves the first loaves into the oven, a sweet, delicate aroma of fresh bread fills the space.\n\nWhat economic risks do energy attacks pose to Ukraine?\n\nHow are labor shortages impacting Ukrainian companies?\n\nHow are power outages affecting Ukrainian business operations?\n\nWhat additional costs are Ukrainian businesses facing during wartime?\n\nSeconds later the lights go out, the ovens switch off and darkness envelops the room. Kutsenko, 31, steps outside into the freezing night, switches on a large rectangular generator and the power kicks back in. It’s a pattern that will be repeated many times as the business struggles to keep working through the power outages caused by Russia’s bombing campaign on Ukraine's energy grid.\n\n“It’s now more than impossible to imagine a Ukrainian business operating without a generator,” said Olha Hrynchuk, the co-founder and head baker of Spelta.\n\nThe cost of purchasing and operating generators to overcome power outages is just one of many challenges facing Ukrainian businesses after nearly four years of war. Acute labor shortages due to mobilization and war-related migration, security risks, declining purchasing power and complicated logistics add to the pressure, officials say.\n\nHrynchuk, 28, opened the bakery 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. That winter was the first year Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy system. Hrynchuk says they barely know what it is to work under “normal” conditions, but have never faced the challenges they do now.\n\nProduction is entirely dependent on electricity and the generator burns about 700 hryvnias ($16) worth of fuel per hour.\n\n“We run on a generator for 10 to 12 hours a day. You have no fixed schedule — you have to adapt and refuel it at the same time,” Hrynchuk said.\n\nOlha Nasonova, 52, who is head of the Restaurants of Ukraine analytical center, says the industry is experiencing its most difficult period of the past 20 years.\n\nWhile businesses were prepared for electricity cuts, no one expected such a cold winter and it’s been especially tough for small cafés and family-run establishments, because they have the least financial resources.\n\nThe “Best Way to Cup” project, which has two venues and roasts and grinds its own coffee, is on the brink of permanent closure. Co-founder Yana Bilym, 33, who opened the cafe in May, said a Russian attack shattered all its windows and glass doors in August. Bilym said the cost of renovation was 150,000 hryvnias (about $3,400), half of which she financed with a bank loan that she only recently finished repaying.",

    "fullText": "In November, approval of Trump’s presidency fell to a new low in his second term, with 36% approving and 60% disapproving. Among all items on the current agenda, his Ukraine policy attracts the least support, with only 31% approving. It ranks lowest even among Republicans, with approval at just 67%, compared with 85% approval for Trump’s foreign policy overall. At the same time, the share of Americans who believe that US assistance to Ukraine is insufficient has reached a wartime high of 46%.\n\nA survey by the Ronald Reagan Institute focused on national security shows that the foreign policy views of the average American largely remain within the framework of traditional US doctrine and are not strongly influenced by the relativism of Trump’s transactional approach. Between 75 and 80% of those surveyed view Russia as an enemy and consider Ukraine an ally. More than 60% want Kyiv to win, and two thirds support arms deliveries to Ukraine, including Tomahawk missiles for strikes on Russian territory, as well as the provision of security guarantees akin to NATO’s Article 5.\n\nTrump’s peace efforts also fail to convince the American public. According to an Economist/YouGov poll, 42% of Americans believe the president is more likely to side with Russia, while only 22% think he takes a balanced position. Although Americans are not well informed about the details of the Trump administration’s peace plan, the net balance of its ratings is negative by 10 percentage points, falling to minus 17 once respondents become familiar with its specifics. Among Republicans, support for the plan drops from 57 to 38% after exposure to its details. This experiment suggests that American society would place responsibility for the consequences of an unstable agreement between Russia and Ukraine on Trump and his perceived pro Russian tilt. In contrast to Trump, most Americans see Putin as a cynical aggressor who cannot be trusted to honour agreements, with 87% believing he would violate any deal that is concluded.\n\nIn November, President Trump’s approval rating reached a new low for his second term, at 36% approving versus 60% disapproving, according to regular Gallup polling. The decline is driven by Republicans, whose approval fell from 90 to 86%, and by independents, where it dropped from 33 to 25%. The three policy areas in which Trump receives the lowest approval are healthcare, with 30% approving, the federal budget at 31%, and Ukraine at 31%. Notably, the lowest ratings of Trump’s Ukraine policy come not only from independents, among whom just 23% approve, but also from Republicans, at 67%, compared with 85% approval for his foreign policy overall. The Ukraine issue can therefore be described as one of the points of an anti Trump consensus in American society.\n\nDissatisfaction with the direction of policy on Ukraine and a shift in public attitudes were already evident in Gallup's August poll. Here, 46% of those surveyed said that the US was providing insufficient assistance to Ukraine, the highest level since the start of the war, while the share who viewed aid as excessive fell to 25%. In December 2024, the balance stood at 30% saying aid was insufficient versus 37% saying it was excessive. That marked the peak of American fatigue with the Ukraine issue. The subsequent shift in the opposite direction began as early as March and was driven mainly by independents.\n\nSimilarly, in December 2024, 50% of Americans believed that the United States’ main task in relation to the Russia–Ukraine conflict was to seek a rapid peace even at the cost of concessions to Russia, while 48% favoured helping Ukraine to regain territories occupied by Russia. By March and August, the share supporting the first position had fallen to 45%, while support for the second had risen to 52%. The share favouring the latter increased by 11 percentage points among Democrats and by 7 among Republicans. Particularly striking is the fact that in August 87% of Americans believed that Putin would violate any agreement concluded with Ukraine. Notably, exactly the same share of Ukrainian citizens believe that the Kremlin intends to use a 'peace agreement' merely as a pause before a renewed attack (→ Re:Russia: Peace on The Aggressor's Terms).\n\nAttitudes in December 2024 were shaped by Trump’s campaign rhetoric, in which he claimed that he would miraculously end the war in Ukraine as soon as he became president. To some extent, these promises appealed even to Democrats, among whom support for Ukraine also weakened at that time. Since then, however, the war has continued for another year, while the absence of US assistance has worsened Ukraine’s position. Moreover, Trump has failed to change Americans’ views of Vladimir Putin, who continues to appear in their eyes as an unprincipled and untrustworthy aggressor. In an October survey by the New York based Institute for Global Affairs, published under the title ‘The Reckless Peacemaker’, 42% of those surveyed said that Trump’s actions had worsened the situation surrounding the Russia–Ukraine war, while only 23% believed they had improved it. The same share, 23%, think that President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, whereas almost two thirds of Americans believe that he does not.\n\nA major survey on national security issues conducted by the Ronald Reagan Institute in late October and early November clearly demonstrates the pro Ukrainian orientation of American public opinion. A majority, 62%, want Ukraine to win the war, while 11% would prefer a Russian victory. Unlike Trump, 75% of Americans view Ukraine as an ally, while Russia tops the list of US 'enemies', a label applied by 79% of those surveyed, ahead of China at 76% and Iran at 77%. The views of MAGA Republicans do not differ dramatically from the national average, with 73% considering Ukraine an ally and 74% viewing Russia as an adversary.\n\nTwo-thirds of those surveyed by the Reagan Institute support the supply of US weapons to Ukraine, which is 9 percentage points higher than last year. Among Republicans, support has increased by 15 percentage points to 59%, while among the most pro Trump respondents it has risen by as much as 20 percentage points to 62%. Support among independents remains the lowest at 53%, but is also increasing by 5 percentage points. Two thirds of all those surveyed, 65%, support sending Ukraine long range cruise missiles such as Tomahawks with permission to strike targets on Russian territory, and 69% support providing Ukraine with US backed security guarantees similar to NATO Article 5.\n\nIn the Reagan Institute survey, American attitudes appear perhaps at their most Reaganite, that is, consistently pro Ukrainian and anti Russian. This may partly reflect the broader framing of the survey, which was entirely focused on US security and geopolitical positioning and may have primed respondents accordingly. Overall, however, the findings suggest that the relativism and eclecticism of Trump’s foreign policy orientation, often described as transactionalism, have not yet undermined the core framework of traditional priorities and value based reference points of US foreign policy doctrine as understood by the average American. A total of 68% of those surveyed view NATO favourably, and 76% support adherence to the Alliance’s Article 5 commitments.\n\nThe latest online survey by The Economist/YouGov, conducted at the turn of November and December, reflects public reactions to the latest peacemaking efforts by the US administration and presents a more nuanced picture that nevertheless remains unfavourable to Trump. Some 42% of those surveyed believe that Trump is more likely to side with Russia, only 12% hold the opposite view, and 22% think that Trump maintains a neutral position. Around 30% of Americans say they are reasonably familiar with the substance of his administration’s peace proposals, while a further 28% know something about them. Overall, 33% tend to approve of Trump’s strategy on Ukraine, which broadly aligns with Gallup figures, while 46% tend to disapprove.\n\nWhen respondents were informed about the details of the Trump–Witkoff peace plan, including consent to reductions in the size of the Ukrainian armed forces, the transfer of Donbas to Russia, a ban on NATO membership, and a prohibition on deploying Alliance forces in Ukraine, their attitudes became more negative. Among those unfamiliar with the details, the net balance of approval for the 'peace plan' stood at minus 10 percentage points, while among those who learned its specifics it fell to minus 17. Independents, although generally negative about the plan, became slightly less critical after learning the details, with the net balance shifting from minus 25 to minus 18. By contrast, support among Republicans dropped sharply from 57 to 38% after exposure to the plan’s content. This experiment suggests that as the negative consequences of an unreliable agreement that is more favourable to Russia become increasingly apparent, American society is likely to place responsibility for them on Donald Trump.\n\nA majority of people surveyed by the Economist/YouGov, 56%, believe that the war in Ukraine is directly related to US national security, while 26% take the opposite, essentially isolationist view, and a further 17% are unsure. Among younger respondents under 30, Republicans, and those who voted for Trump, the share of isolationists who see the conflict as distant and irrelevant to the United States is higher, but remains below one third. These distributions also indicate that Americans’ foreign policy views are far less susceptible to Trump’s supposedly 'revolutionary' relativism in international affairs than is sometimes assumed.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach a deal to end the nearly four‑year war, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters, as Russian strikes on energy infrastructure forced nuclear power plants to cut output on Saturday.\n\nIf the June deadline is not met, the Trump administration will likely put pressure on both sides to meet it, he added.\n\n“The Americans are proposing the parties end the war by the beginning of this summer and will probably put pressure on the parties precisely according to this schedule,” Zelenskyy said, speaking to reporters on Friday. Zelenskyy’s comments were embargoed until Saturday morning.\n\n“And they say that they want to do everything by June. And they will do everything to end the war. And they want a clear schedule of all events,” he said.\n\nHe said the U.S. proposed holding the next round of trilateral talks next week in their country for the first time, likely in Miami, Zelenskyy said. “We confirmed our participation,” he added.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia presented the U.S. with a $12 trillion economic proposal — which he dubbed the “Dmitriev package” after Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Bilateral economic deals with the U.S. form part of the broader negotiating process.\n\nRussian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure continued with over 400 drones and about 40 missiles launched overnight Saturday, Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Targets included the energy grid, generation facilities and distribution networks.\n\nUkrenergo, the state energy transmission operator, said the attack was the second mass strike on energy infrastructure since the start of the year, forcing nuclear power plants to reduce output. Eight facilities in eight regions came under attack, it said in a statement.\n\n“As a result of missile strikes on key high-voltage substations that ensured the output of nuclear power units, all nuclear power plants in the territories under control were forced to reduce their load,” the statement said.\n\nIt said the power deficit in the country has increased “significantly” as a result of the attacks forcing an extension of hourly power outages in all regions of Ukraine.\n\nThe latest deadline follows U.S.-brokered trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi that produced no breakthrough as the warring parties cling to mutually exclusive demands. Russia is pressing Ukraine to withdraw from the Donbas, where fighting remains intense — a condition Kyiv says it will never accept.\n\n“Difficult issues remained difficult. Ukraine once again confirmed its positions on the Donbas issue. ‘We stand where we stand’ is the fairest and most reliable model for a ceasefire today, in our opinion,” Zelenskyy said. He reiterated that the most challenging topics would be reserved for a trilateral meeting between leaders.\n\nZelenskyy said no common ground was reached on managing the Russian‑held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and expressed skepticism about a U.S. proposal to turn the Donbas region, coveted by Russia, into a free economic zone as a compromise.\n\n“I do not know whether this can be implemented, because when we talked about a free economic zone, we had different views on it,” he said.\n\nHe said in the last round of talks the negotiators discussed how a ceasefire would be technically monitored. He added that the U.S. has reaffirmed it would play a role in that process.\n\nRepeated Russian aerial assaults have in recent months focused on Ukraine’s power grid, causing blackouts and disrupting the heating and water supply for families during a bitterly cold winter, putting more pressure on Kyiv.\n\nZelenskyy said the U.S. again proposed a ceasefire banning strikes on energy infrastructure. Ukraine is ready to observe such a pause if Russia commits; but he added that when Moscow previously agreed to a one-week pause suggested by the U.S., it was violated after just four days.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "The fighter, built for war with Russia, is set to be one of the three main pillars of Ukraine's future air force.",
    "fullText": "Swedish defense prime Saab is exploring the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System as a cheaper armament option for its JAS 39 Gripen fighters, firm executives told Business Insider this week.\n\n\"The APKWS is in interest because other platforms are now integrating 70mm guided rockets. So we are, of course, eyeing that capability now,\" Jussi Halmetoja, operations advisor for Saab's air domain, said at the Singapore Airshow.\n\nHalmetoja said the company was looking at ways to integrate the weapons system, which uses a guided version of the Hydra 70mm rocket, onto its older Gripen C and latest Gripen E models.\n\nHe made the comments as he and Mikael Franzên, chief marketing officer for the Gripen program, discussed the company's observation from the Ukraine war that it needs more inexpensive weapons to counter uncrewed aerial systems.\n\n\"I mean, right now we are using very expensive weapons to kill very cheap drones,\" Franzén said of traditional Western air combat.\n\nHe added that Saab is hoping to potentially equip the Gripen with systems that can fit multiple munitions onto a single hardpoint.\n\n\"If you can have four or 10 on each hardpoint, then you can kill a lot more drones,\" Franzên said. The APWKS is typically mounted on aircraft with multilaunch pods.\n\nKyiv has signed a letter of intent with Sweden to potentially acquire up to 150 Gripen E fighters in the coming years. Ukraine's air force has yet to fly the jet, which is touted as an ideal fighter for battling Russia because it's built to operate from dispersed, rugged airfields and in the Arctic domain.\n\nKyiv is now flying much of its small fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons from such small airfields, often moving the aircraft to increase their survivability.\n\nBut Franzén and Halmetoja said the Gripen can turn around much faster from dispersed airfields and be ready for a new mission within 10 minutes of landing.\n\nSweden, South Africa, Brazil, Thailand, Czechia, and Hungary are among the countries that fly the Gripen.\n\nThe APWKS, meanwhile, is already being deployed across various systems in Ukraine.\n\nFor example, the VAMPIRE counter-UAS systems feature a four-barrel launcher for the guided Hydra rockets that can be mounted on a pickup truck.\n\nThe cost of using one APKWS round is estimated at $20,000 to $35,000, compared to weapons more typically associated with modern fighters, such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder, which costs roughly $450,000, and the AIM-120 AMRAAM, which costs roughly $1 million.\n\nConcerns about missile costs against cheaper drones have risen steadily since the war began, and as Russia has continuously grown its loitering munitions mass manufacturing.\n\nOutside Ukraine, the US military has also been using the APWKS to recently fight drone attacks in the Middle East. The weapons system, loaded on American F-16s and F-15s, was responsible for roughly 40% of the drone kills scored by US forces against Houthi drones during last year's Operation Rough Rider.",

    "description": "Blessed with short takeoff and landing capability, the rugged An-28 Cash utility transport is the latest addition to Ukraine’s anti-drone force.",
    "fullText": "New footage has emerged showing how Ukraine is using at least one adapted Antonov An-28 Cash twin-turboprop utility aircraft as part of its anti-drone inventory. While images of the aircraft, replete with multiple drone kill marks, had previously been published, we now get to see the aircraft’s armament — a six-barrel Gatling-type M134 Minigun — in action, too.\n\nA passenger An-28 aircraft armed with miniguns is shooting down Russian drones over Ukraine, French TF1 got an inside. The crew consists of civilian volunteers who have already destroyed nearly 150 drones during air defense missions. #Ukraine pic.twitter.com/x1E921TPT2\n\n(@NOELreports) February 5, 2026\n\nThe video in question was published by the French television channel TF1 and can also be found at this link. The French journalists got to see the An-28 during a nighttime combat sortie, including opening fire with its 7.62mm M134, which is pintle-mounted in the cabin door. The An-28’s high-wing configuration provides a notably wide field of fire.\n\nThe Minigun is well-proven in aerial applications. It was a key feature in the genesis of the AC-47 and later side-firing gunships converted from cargo planes, as well, albeit intended to engage targets on the ground. Typical firing rates for Miniguns are generally between 3,000 and 6,000 rounds per minute, or 50 and 100 shots every second.\n\nThe date and location of the An-28 footage were not revealed, but one of the aircraft crew members describes hunting Russian drones “in the southeast” of Ukraine.\n\nBelow the An-28’s cockpit are 115 painted silhouettes of Shahed/Geran-type long-range one-way attack drones, two of which are painted in yellow. The significance of these is unclear, but they may refer to 10 kills of the same drone types. This would tally with the French report’s statement that, overall, the An-28’s four-person crew has destroyed almost 150 Russian drones. A single kill marking also indicates that another twin-boom-type drone was brought down.\n\nOn this occasion, the crew had 10 minutes to scramble into the air, with an overall flight time of five hours.\n\nIn the course of the sortie in the video, the crew shot down five Shahed/Geran drones. One of these was intercepted while flying over a Ukrainian village. They waited until it was over an unpopulated area before engaging that, too.\n\nThe report also explains the basic mode of operation.\n\nThe An-28 crew initially relies on air traffic controllers to guide them to the area where Russian drones are known to be flying. One of the crew is a ‘camera operator,’ who is seen sitting in front of a screen, which appears to show the feed from an infrared camera, presumably mounted externally on a turret. The gunner, and at least one other member of the crew, is provided with night-vision goggles (NVGs).\n\nVarious hazards face the An-28 crew. First, the presence of Russian cruise missiles means they have to leave the area, due to the high risk of collision.\n\nThe Russian drones are also presenting more threats to interceptors.\n\nIn the course of this year, Russia has begun to arm the Shahed/Geran with both man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) and R-60 air-to-air missiles. These developments come as Russia makes additional alterations to the drone, including self-protection systems.\n\nInterception of the Russian Shahed kamikaze drone with an installed R-60 air-to-air missile. \n\nIt was intercepted by Darknode unit of the @usf_army, using STING anti-Shahed drone developed by the @wilendhornets and funded by @sternenkofund. https://t.co/XHEjuCP31F pic.twitter.com/oje4VOXTbz\n\n(@bayraktar_1love) December 1, 2025\n\nRussian forces are mounting Igla MANPADS on Shahed drones to target Ukrainian helicopters that intercept them. The drones carry a camera and radio modem, and the missile is launched remotely by an operator in Russian territory. pic.twitter.com/T5TKPHyhVu\n\n— WarTranslated (@wartranslated) January 4, 2026\n\nReportedly, the An-28 crew is made up of civilian volunteers, paralleling the effort made by pilots and gunners flying Yakovlev Yak-52 prop trainers on behalf of the Ukrainian Army Aviation. You can read more about their activities here.\n\nDeveloped in the former Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic by the Antonov Design Bureau, the An-28 is a twin-engined light turboprop transport, first flown in 1969 and primarily intended for Aeroflot service as a short-range airliner. It has a notable short takeoff and landing (STOL) capability, making it ideal for operating in and out of shorter and more austere airstrips, of the kind that Ukraine makes extensive use of in the conflict with Russia.\n\nA little under 200 were built, with most of the production being undertaken in Poland by PZL-Mielec. The Polish company developed an improved variant, the M28 Skytruck.\n\nVersions of the M28 have seen more extensive military service than the An-28, notably with the United States as the C-145A Combat Coyote, which was formerly used by Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).\n\nIt’s interesting to note that, back in 2013, AFSOC actually explored the possibility of converting C-145As into small side-firing gunships, a sort of miniature take on the AC-130 concept, with an eye toward potentially being able to transfer that capability to American allies and partners. This, however, was armed with twin 50-caliber GAU-18 machine guns.\n\nIt remains unclear, for now, how many An-28s have been adapted as ‘Shahed-hunters.’ It is also hard to find accurate data on how many airworthy An-28s are available to Ukraine. On the other hand, there is the possibility that more aircraft could be transferred from Polish or U.S. military stocks, or even from other civilian or armed forces operators.\n\nCertainly, there seems to be a place for lighter aircraft, like the Minigun-armed An-28, in Ukraine’s drone-killing force.\n\nAs we have reported in the past, light aircraft and helicopters are said to be responsible for downing between 10 and 12 percent of all drones claimed by Ukrainian air defenses of all kinds. Fixed-wing aircraft are also generally considered more survivable than helicopters, allowing them to operate closer to the front lines.\n\nWith Russia using huge numbers of drones, alongside ballistic and cruise missiles, and decoys, against critical infrastructure targets and cities in Ukraine, the country has assembled a multi-layered air defense network. This ranges from advanced Western-supplied Patriot surface-to-air missiles and F-16 fighters at one end of the scale, via Soviet-era systems and hastily developed “FrankenSAMs,” all the way down to light aircraft, ultralight aircraft, and mobile fire teams equipped with machine guns and searchlights. In addition, there are a growing number of non-kinetic options, such as electronic warfare, too. A network of acoustic sensors all over the country and an app that ties this information to spotter reports are also key elements of Ukraine’s unique air defense network.\n\nThe challenge is only set to grow. Russia, as we have previously noted, now manufactures Shahed/Geran drones at the rate of 2,000 per month and plans to nearly triple that in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBased on available accounts, the Minigun-armed An-28 appears to be a very efficient part of Ukraine’s anti-drone defenses, and with the level of Russian drone activity over the country growing, we are likely to see further such innovations in the future.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "description": "The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia’s Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications.",
    "fullText": "The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia’s Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said SpaceX, which owns Starlink, is working with Ukraine to update a “whitelist” of approved and verified Starlink terminals, while unapproved Russian systems have been blocked.\n\n“The Starlink terminals added to the ‘whitelist’ are working. The Russians’ terminals have already been blocked,” Fedorov said in a statement Thursday. “We continue to verify Starlink terminals. The first batch of terminals that made it onto the ‘whitelist’ are already operational.”\n\nA source at the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces claimed that “all Russian Starlinks have been cut off” along the front line as of Thursday evening local time.\n\nUnder US sanctions, Starlink cannot be sold to or used by Russia. However, analysts and Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia has increasingly been finding ways to leverage the system to its own advantage. CNN previously reported on Russia’s practice of mounting Starlink systems on its attack drones, which allow the weapons to bypass Ukraine’s electronic defenses that disable drones by jamming GPS and radio signals, and to strike deeper into the country.\n\nUkraine has also relied heavily on Starlink since the beginning the war, using it to operate military communications and drones, as well as information systems for public institutions like hospitals and schools.\n\n“The enemy on the front lines is facing not just a problem, but a catastrophe. All command and control of the troops has collapsed. Assault operations have been halted in many areas,” said Serhii Beskrestnov, an adviser to the defense minister.\n\nElon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said earlier this week that it was taking steps to stop Russia’s “unauthorized” use of the Starlink satellite internet constellation. Musk reiterated Thursday that it’s “important to register your Starlink terminal if in Ukraine.”\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense has not addressed the claims of Starlink disruptions.\n\nBut Russian military bloggers began commenting on the Starlink outages on Wednesday and Thursday, noting that Russia’s internet and communications capabilities on the front line have taken a hit.\n\nOne pro-Kremlin military blogger, Boris Rozhin, wrote a Q&A-style post on Telegram, saying, “Yes, it will have a certain impact on internet availability in the field,” and “yes, there are no alternatives at all, right now.” He also claimed that Russian forces were working to bypass the block and to bring high-speed internet to the field using other methods.\n\nAnother Russian military blog, which supports the airborne special forces, tried to downplay the disruption, writing: “The Starlinks may have been shut down, but the backup communications are still there. The radios are working, and there’s communication between the positions.”\n\nSome Starlink units used by the Ukrainian side were also reportedly cut off, although it’s unclear how widespread the disruption is, as the government continues the whitelisting process.\n\nOne Ukrainian combat officer, Tetiana Chornovol, posted on social media that “the shutdown of Starlink left my two combat positions without communication,” adding that her unit has since brought in an alternative communication system.\n\n“It works for us,” a Ukrainian drone pilot said in a video posted to Telegram. “We immediately registered our Starlink terminal, and everything is fine.”\n\nMeanwhile, the second round of trilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States concluded in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.\n\nUkrainian presidential chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov, who was part of his country’s delegation, described the negotiations as “truly constructive.”\n\n“I am grateful to the US and the UAE for their high-quality organization and mediation,” Budanov told the Ukrainian news agency RBC-Ukraine.\n\nWhile no breakthrough deal came out of the two days of talks, Russia and Ukraine did agree to conduct their first prisoner exchange since October. Each returned 157 prisoners of war to the other side on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS and US negotiator Steve Witkoff.\n\n“While significant work remains, steps like this demonstrate that sustained diplomatic engagement is delivering tangible results and advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine,” Witkoff said Thursday in a post on X.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the negotiators agreed to hold another round of talks “in the near future.”\n\nCNN’s Ivana Kottasová, Daria Tarasova-Markina and Sophie Tanno contributed to this report.",

    "description": "The U.S. and Russia agreed Thursday to reestablish high-level military dialogue for the first time in more than four years in another sign of warming relations between the two countries since Presiden...",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. and Russia agreed Thursday to reestablish high-level military dialogue for the first time in more than four years in another sign of warming relations between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to office and sought to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nHigh-level military communication was suspended in late 2021, as tension between Moscow and Washington rose ahead of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump then campaigned for a second term on promises that he would swiftly end the fighting. Many of his proposals for peace have heavily favored the Kremlin, including requiring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia.\n\nThe restored communication channel “will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace,” the U.S. European Command said in a statement. The agreement emerged from a meeting between senior Russian and American military officials in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nU.S. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who is the commander in Europe of both U.S. and NATO forces, was in Abu Dhabi, where talks between American, Russian and Ukrainian officials on ending the war entered a second day.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow escalated its attacks on Ukraine’s power grid in an apparent effort to deny civilians power and to weaken public support for the fight, while hostilities continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line snaking through eastern and southern parts of Ukraine.\n\nThe resumption of the military hotline marks an effort to ease tensions that soared after the start of the war and to avoid collisions between Russian and U.S. forces.\n\nIn one such incident in March 2023, the American military said it ditched an Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone in the Black Sea after a pair of Russian fighter jets dumped fuel on it, and then one of them struck its propeller while flying in international airspace.\n\nMoscow has denied that its warplanes hit the drone, alleging that it crashed while making a sharp maneuver. The Kremlin said its aircraft reacted to a violation of a no-fly zone Russia has established in the area near Crimea.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly voiced concern about intelligence flights by the U.S. and other NATO aircraft over the Black Sea, and some Russian officials charged that the American surveillance flights helped gather intelligence that allowed Ukraine to strike Russian targets.\n\nNATO members have been increasingly worried about intrusions into allied airspace. Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing NATO’s response.\n\nIn September, a swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland’s airspace, prompting NATO aircraft to scramble to intercept them and shoot down some of the devices. It was the first direct encounter between NATO and Moscow since the full-scale invasion. Later that month, NATO jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia’s airspace.\n\nRussia, Ukraine exchange prisoners following talks\n\nThe delegations from Moscow and Kyiv were joined Thursday in Abu Dhabi by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council chief, who was present at the meeting.\n\nThey were also at last month's talks in the same place as the Trump administration tries to steer Russia and Ukraine toward a settlement.\n\nOfficials have provided no information about any progress in the discussions.\n\nFollowing the talks on Thursday, however, Russia and Ukraine said they carried out a prisoner exchange.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it brought 157 Russian servicemen back from Ukrainian captivity, as well as three Russian nationals captured during Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Ukrainian officials said 150 Ukrainian servicemen and seven civilians returned from Russian captivity.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the released Russian soldiers are currently in Belarus, getting medical assistance, before being taken back to Russia “for treatment and rehabilitation.”\n\nUkrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that among the 150 service members who returned from Russian captivity, 18 were \"illegally sentenced by Russia.” He said that “overall, those released are in a difficult psychological condition, and some are critically underweight.”\n\nZelenskyy says 55,000 Ukrainian troops killed in the war\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 55,000 Ukrainian troops have died since Russia’s invasion. “And there is a large number of people whom Ukraine considers missing,” he added in an interview broadcast late Wednesday by French TV channel France 2.\n\nThe last time Zelenskyy gave a figure for battlefield deaths, in early 2025, he said 46,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.\n\nZelenskyy has repeatedly said his country needs security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe to deter any postwar Russian attacks.\n\nUkrainians must feel that there is genuine progress toward peace and “not toward a scenario in which the Russians exploit everything to their advantage and continue their strikes,” Zelenskyy said on social media late Wednesday.\n\nLast year saw a 31% increase in Ukrainian civilian casualties compared with 2024, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nAlmost 15,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and just over 40,000 wounded since the start of the war through last December, according to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.\n\nRussian troops have lost access to their Starlink satellite internet terminals on the front line, Ukrainian Economic Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Thursday, after Ukraine asked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to help deny Russia use of the service in Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces have consequently lost command-and-control capabilities and navigation for drones, and assaults have stopped in many sectors, according to Fedorov’s adviser Serhii Beskrestnov. Russian officials made no immediate comment.\n\nUkraine is registering its civilian and military Starlink users on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals are disabled inside Ukraine.\n\nAlso, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said during a visit to Kyiv that he agreed with Zelenskyy to develop the joint production of ammunition at plants in their countries.\n\nZelenskyy said Poland plans to increase supplies to Ukraine of liquefied natural gas, and the countries are exploring an exchange of weaponry, with Kyiv possibly receiving Polish MiG fighter jets and Warsaw receiving Ukrainian drones.\n\nRussia fired 183 drones and two ballistic missiles at Ukraine overnight, according to the Ukrainian air force. Three people were injured, officials said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses downed 95 Ukrainian drones overnight over several regions, the Azov Sea and Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nThis story corrects an earlier version that said Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2016. The annexation happened in 2014.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Russian missiles and drones have pounded Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks, plunging people into frozen darkness in one of the country’s coldest winters on record.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of illegally targeting power infrastructure during the war to deny civilians light, heating and running water.\n\n\"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorize people is more important to Russia than diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, on the eve of a new round of talks about ending the conflict and as temperatures in Kyiv hovered around minus 20 C (minus 3 F).\n\nRussia says its attacks are a legitimate part of its military campaign against its neighbor. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine itself is widely regarded as an illegal act of aggression.\n\nSo, are attacks on energy installations allowed during war?\n\nCombatants can legally target a power grid if the attack “directly affects a valid military target” — but they cannot cause excessive civilian casualties, said David Crane, former chief prosecutor at the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n\nIn the case of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, “the indiscriminate and widespread targeting does not come close to what is legal,” he said in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says that parts of energy systems providing essential services to civilians “are in principle civilian objects, and as such are protected against direct attack and reprisals as well as incidental harm.”\n\nPretrial judges from the International Criminal Court, in fact, issued arrest warrants in 2024 for top Russian military brass and the country’s former defense minister for their alleged involvement in missile strikes targeting electricity infrastructure.\n\nIn announcing warrants for former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia’s chief military officer, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the court said that judges found “reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged strikes were directed against civilian objects, and for those installations that may have qualified as military objectives at the relevant time, the expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage.”\n\nRussia is not a member of the court, rejects its jurisdiction, and refuses to extradite suspects to face justice in the ICC’s courtrooms in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe Russian military has repeatedly said that it has targeted energy facilities and other infrastructure that support Ukrainian military industries and armed forces. It has denied targeting residential areas despite daily evidence to the contrary.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted Wednesday that “our military is striking the targets that they believe are associated with the military complex of the Kyiv regime, the operation is continuing.”\n\nKyiv accuses Russia of seeking to wear down Ukrainians’ appetite for the fight by inflicting grinding hardship on civilians forced to live in dark, freezing homes.\n\nAuthorities say Russia has tried to cripple Ukraine's electricity network by targeting substations, transformers, turbines and generators at power plants. Ukraine’s largest private power company, DTEK, said that this week's overnight attack was the ninth major assault on the company’s thermal power plants since October.\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.",

    "description": "The first phase of the Pentagon's drone competition, Gauntlet, begins later this month. US drone operators will fly and test the systems.",
    "fullText": "Over two dozen companies, including two from Ukraine, have been selected to build and test their small one-way attack drone prototypes for the first phase of a new Pentagon program focused on drone dominance.\n\nThe evaluation, Gauntlet, begins later this month at Fort Benning in Georgia, where military personnel will fly the designs, putting them to the test to inform purchasing decisions. When the testing concludes in March, the department will put in roughly $150 million in prototype delivery orders.\n\nThe Pentagon aims to ultimately, by 2027, field hundreds of thousands of low-cost, one-way attack drones.\n\nThe Pentagon released the list of 25 companies involved on Tuesday. It includes a lot of start-ups like Performance Drone Works LLC, which was an offshoot of the Drone Racing League, as well as vendors like Kratos SRE Inc., a subsidiary of the larger Kratos Defense.\n\nTwo Ukrainian companies are also competing in the Gauntlet evaluations: Ukrainian Defense Drone Tech Corp and General Cherry Corp. Both are major developers with years of experience building and upgrading first-person view one-way attack drones for the Ukrainian military.\n\nGeneral Cherry Corp was established in Zaporizhzhia early on in Russia's war against Ukraine and has been developing small uncrewed aerial systems for its forces. Per the company, its first-person-view one-way attack drones are employed across 40 different brigades, and they regularly use soldier feedback to improve their systems.\n\nLate last year, the company revealed its new AIR Pro interceptor drone designed to strike Russian reconnaissance and attack drones. The company said that the AIR Pro had been used on the front lines and demonstrated a speed of around 125 miles per hour.\n\nOn Facebook, General Cherry said its \"participation in the American defense program is a recognition of our combat experience and shows a high level of trust in Ukrainian engineering solutions.\"\n\nThere's little to no information publicly available on the company the Pentagon identified as Ukrainian Defense Drone Tech Corp. Local Ukrainian media identified it as a Ukrainian manufacturer; however, reports said the name was unfamiliar.\n\nAll of the vendors will have their systems tested and evaluated by military drone operators at Fort Benning, Georgia, starting February 18 and leading into early March. Then, DoD will pick drones for prototyping, place delivery orders worth approximately $150 million, and receive the drones over the following five months.\n\nThe Defense Department publicly unveiled its Drone Dominance Program in early December, signaling a push to rapidly acquire large numbers of low-cost attack drones.\n\nThese systems — which have reshaped combat in Ukraine and are becoming an increasingly important part of US testing and operations — were singled out by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as critical because they provide a far cheaper alternative to high-end, expensive munitions.\n\nInitial planning indicates the department intends to spend $1.1 billion on the program over four phases and regularly buy drones to offer a consistent demand signal to the US defense industry.\n\nThe beginning of the program follows announcements from President Donald Trump in June on supporting the American drone industry and arming troops and a memo from Hegseth in July.\n\n\"Drones are the biggest battlefield innovation in a generation, accounting for most of this year's casualties in Ukraine,\" Hegseth said in the July 2025 memo, adding that \"US units are not outfitted with the lethal small drones the modern battlefield requires.\"\n\n\"We are buying what works,\" he said, \"fast, at scale, and without bureaucratic delay.\"\n\nThe full list of defense companies participating in the DoD's Gauntlet competition are: Anno.ai Inc., Ascent Aerosystems Inc., Auterion Government Solutions Inc., Dzyne Technologies LLC, Ewing Aerospace LLC, Farage Precision LLC, Firestorm Labs Inc., General Cherry Corp., Greensight Inc., Griffon Aerospace Inc., Halo Aeronautics LLC, Kratos SRE Inc., ModalAI Inc., Napatree Technology LLC, Neros Inc., Nokturnal AI, Paladin Defense Services LLC, Performance Drone Works LLC, Responsibly Ltd., Swarm Defense Technologies LLC, Teal Drones Inc., Ukrainian Defense Drones Tech Corp., Vector Defense Inc., W.S.

    "description": "The developers behind Ukraine's interceptor drones are working to ensure that these cheap air defense tools don't become obsolete.",
    "fullText": "The developers behind Ukraine's interceptor drones are constantly having to upgrade their products to keep pace with changing Russian tactics and ensure these cheap air defense tools don't become obsolete.\n\nSeveral people directly involved with interceptor drones and their development told Business Insider that the systems are being upgraded, though how quickly those improvements roll out varies.\n\nInterceptor drones emerged last year as a crucial, low-cost tool Ukraine uses to defend against worsening Russian attacks.\n\nThese weapons are typically used to hunt fixed-wing Russian drones conducting strike and reconnaissance missions. They're armed with small warheads and fly directly into their targets or explode nearby to destroy them midair.\n\nSome Ukrainian interceptor drones cost as little as $2,500 — just a fraction of the price of the Russian drones, estimated to cost between $10,000 and $100,000, depending on their battlefield function.\n\nRussia has changed its tactics over the past year, modifying its drones to fly faster and higher and even arming them with cameras and air-to-air missiles to defeat Ukrainian defenses. The changes have forced Ukraine's defense industry to adapt.\n\nWild Hornets, a defense technology outfit making drones for the Ukrainian military, \"continuously plans upgrades\" to its drones and other related equipment like ground control systems, said Alex Roslin, the firm's foreign support coordinator.\n\nThis process occurs daily, he said, and \"innovations\" are made at all levels of the production journey, from individual components to new systems like Wild Hornets' well-known Sting interceptor drone.\n\nRoslin said the firm is focused on refining its drones and scaling up production, priorities the team discusses every day.\n\nSome other products receive improvements at a slower pace. For instance, the British government, which is working to produce thousands of interceptor drones a month for Ukraine, said in early January that it updates the design about every six weeks \"to stay ahead of Russian tactics.\"\n\nBritain said \"live battlefield data feeds straight into UK production lines, allowing rapid upgrades and faster delivery to the front line.\"\n\nAs the need for interceptor drones grows among Kyiv's forces, so does the market for these weapons. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters last month that the local defense industry is producing around 1,000 systems a day, hitting the goal he set over the summer.\n\nWith so many interceptor drones now on the market, competition is driving manufacturers to constantly improve their products to fly faster and higher to meet the Russian threats, said Oleksiy, the deputy commander of a Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces mobile air defense unit.\n\nOleksiy's unit is tasked with protecting Irpin, a city on the outskirts of Kyiv, and has historically relied on a .50-caliber M2 Browning machine gun mounted in the bed of a pickup truck to battle Russian drones.\n\nHis crew began training on new interceptor drones last year to strengthen their defensive arsenal. The drones can fly at speeds of around 300 kilometers per hour (186 miles per hour) and reach an altitude of up to 6,000 meters (nearly 20,000 feet).\n\nHe said the quadcopter-style interceptor drone his crew trains with is updated every six months using feedback from combat forces provided to the manufacturer.\n\nThe rise of Ukraine's interceptor drones has come as Russia has invested heavily in long-range drone operations, regularly sending hundreds of drones — some armed and others decoys designed to exhaust air defenses — across the border in nightly attacks.\n\nWestern military officials and Ukrainian organizations have said that interceptor drones are responsible for downing thousands of Russian drones over the past year.\n\nNATO countries are taking note of the interceptors' success as a low-cost air defense tool, with some allies buying and deploying systems to defend the Eastern flank from possible Russian drone incursions.",

    "description": "The UK's Irish Guards are learning drone warfare lessons from Ukraine, including why being able to quickly make new parts on the battlefield is key.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian battlefield lessons are pushing a British Army unit to adopt a technology that has shown promise in the war against Russia: 3D printing drone parts close to where they're needed most.\n\nLt Col Ben Irwin-Clark, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion Irish Guards, an elite infantry regiment, told Business Insider that the battalion's decision to print drones and drone parts was \"definitely a lesson we picked up from Ukraine.\"\n\nThe battalion has been putting more effort into preparations for drone warfare since the unit linked up with Ukrainian troops during a training rotation, and 3D printing is key to that effort.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has shown how quickly armies must adapt, experiment, and replace broken equipment — often faster than traditional supply chains allow.\n\nIrwin-Clark said that in the last few months of working with the Ukrainians, the battalion saw just how important small drones are. It has now trained 78 of its 300 people as pilots or instructors.\n\nAnd it has also quickly learned that training with drones means breaking them. Rather than waiting on industry or time-consuming formal procurement channels, the unit decided it was faster and cheaper to fix and modify drones in-house.\n\n3D printing can shrink procurement timelines from weeks to hours. That speed matters for keeping training relevant and affordable, but it also has clear battlefield implications, where tactics and equipment needs can change in days, requiring immediate solutions.\n\nThe unit's printer is making things like bomblets and copies of Russian equipment, which the unit had struggled to procure quickly through regular channels.\n\nThe effort is part of the battalion's new and growing \"drone hub,\" a first-of-its-kind facility within the British Army where soldiers can repair drones and train for drone warfare.\n\nThose efforts are expanding. The battalion printed its first drone body last month — a shell that can be fitted with components such as battery packs, sensors, and motors — offering a low-cost, fast way to assemble new drones, with plans to make production more routine.\n\nIrwin-Clark said that the long-term plan is to significantly expand 3D printing. For now, the focus is on replicating existing technology, which he described as \"in its infancy.\" Eventually, he said, the soldiers should be able to design and print their own innovations.\n\nHe pointed to Ukrainian examples, such as modifying commercially acquired drones to drop munitions by 3D-printing attachment parts, as a model of the kind of bottom-up innovation that he wants British soldiers to emulate.\n\nThe aim, he added, is also to make the capability mobile, putting 3D printers in vehicles so parts can be produced close to the fight, in hours rather than days.\n\nThat speed close to the fight is crucial, as Ukraine's fight has demonstrated.\n\nUkrainian forces have used 3D printing to produce drone bodies and components near the front, allowing them to build new drones and return damaged ones to service within hours, rather than waiting days for replacements.\n\nSoldiers and other outfits have also printed bomb casings, which are then filled with explosives — a workaround for ammunition shortages when raw explosives are available. One volunteer group told Business Insider that its casings cost less than $4 each, making them cheap and disposable.\n\nUkrainian companies are also 3D printing spools for fiber-optic drones, the unjammable drones controlled by cables.\n\nExactly how widespread 3D printing is across Ukraine's forces remains unclear. Still, it has become an important enabler in a war where cost, speed, and adaptability matter as much as sophistication. Ukraine's military is far smaller than Russia's and benefits disproportionately from low-cost, rapidly produced equipment.\n\nThe Irish Guards picked up many of these lessons while deployed in support of Operation Interflex, the UK-led multinational mission involving 14 countries that has trained more than 62,000 Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nWhile Interflex is designed to share Western and NATO doctrine with Ukrainian forces, British troops have also adapted their own training based on Ukrainian combat experience.\n\nThat has included reviving trench warfare training, revising assumptions about how future ground combat would unfold, and adding anti-drone nets across training events.\n\nUkraine is fighting a war unlike those Western militaries have experienced in decades — a large-scale, grinding industrial war of attrition against a peer adversary. By contrast, recent US and UK operations have largely been counterinsurgency campaigns.\n\nNATO countries have responded by increasing defense spending and investing in capabilities that the war has shown to be especially relevant, including drones and other low-cost systems.\n\nDrones and other low-cost solutions may not play as big a role for some Western militaries, which have deeper arsenals and more advanced airpower. It was a lack of these capabilities that largely drove Ukraine to invest heavily in drones in the first place.\n\nThat said, there is an expectation that these weapons will have a part ot play in future fights, so the US, UK, and other militaries are working out best practices on this warfighting technology.\n\nIrwin-Clark, speaking at a training demo recently attended by Business Insider, shared that \"it's really inspiring working with the Ukrainians and training Ukrainians, and I think what I hadn't anticipated over a year ago when we started our stint on Interflex is how much we would learn.\"",

    "description": "Volodymyr Zelensky has been talking up Russia’s battlefield fatalities and has asked his new Defense Minister to make it a priority.",
    "fullText": "Volodymyr Zelensky has been talking up Russia’s battlefield fatalities and has asked his new defense minister to make it a priority.\n\nIn December alone, more than 35,000 Russian soldiers were killed or seriously wounded, Ukraine’s leader says, and the aim should be to raise the number even higher – to 50,000 per month.\n\n“Make the cost of war for Russia one it cannot sustain, thereby forcing peace through strength” – this was the task set him by the president, Mykhailo Fedorov told reporters in his first briefing as Defense Minister.\n\nThe suggestion that Russia is suffering heavy losses is not new. A new report last week estimated that 1.2 million Russians have either been killed, wounded or are missing since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago – the highest casualty figure suffered by a major military power since World War II. The report put the number of Ukrainian casualties between 500,000 and 600,000.\n\n“The data suggests Russia is hardly winning,” the report’s authors wrote.\n\nMaybe not, but as senior officials from Ukraine, Russia and the United States prepare for the next round of direct talks in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, it would be a mistake for Ukraine’s supporters to get carried away.\n\n“Highlighting the huge numbers of Russian fatalities is an indicator that Ukraine’s main strategy is attrition. But we need more than that if we are going to move the war dynamics in a better direction,” a former Ukrainian official told CNN.\n\nOn the one hand, focusing on headline-grabbing numbers offers important perspective on Ukraine’s refusal to give up Donetsk as part of any “peace” deal with Russia.\n\nThe logic behind Kyiv’s position is simple: Very few Ukrainians believe Putin has any goal other than the total subjugation of their country. So, why hand over territory for nothing if Ukraine can expect to kill hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers while Moscow keeps trying to capture Donetsk by force?\n\nUkrainian soldiers still hold about 20% of the eastern region, which includes heavily fortified cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, and latest estimates by the Institute for the Study of War suggest it could be another 18 months before Russia captures it all.\n\nIf those Russian soldiers are not killed fighting – the logic continues – they will remain in occupied Ukrainian territory ready to restart the war, from a more advantageous position, just as soon as the Kremlin has contrived a pretext to do so.\n\nVery few in Ukraine believe Putin will drop his territorial demands, and most have lost faith that US President Donald Trump will apply necessary pressure to make him change his mind.\n\n“Despite the government negotiating in good faith, many think the whole process is done to ensure US government support,” the former Ukrainian official said.\n\n“People are exceedingly skeptical about the negotiating process.”\n\nBut if there is no confidence that negotiations are headed anywhere, what about Ukraine’s battlefield strategy? Is piling up the other side’s body bags the best way forward?\n\nAn American former fighter, Ryan O’Leary, who led an international volunteer unit called Chosen Company, believes not, triggering a vigorous debate after he laid out his arguments in a social media post.\n\nHe took issue with the much vaunted “e-points” scheme, whereby Ukraine’s units earn points for each Russian soldier killed or piece of materiel destroyed. The points are exchanged for new equipment, and the Defense Ministry says the scheme provides a wealth of data that helps shape future plans.\n\nBut O’Leary suggested they create the wrong incentives, causing Ukrainian commanders to prioritize more straightforward drone strikes against infantry targets around the line of combat, rather than tougher but more significant deep strikes against Russian logistics - like vehicles and communication hubs, as well as Russian drone crews operating from rear positions.\n\n“Drone warfare is not about who hits more soldiers today … Operational depth is where wars are decided. If the enemy can move fuel, ammo, drones, crews, and repair vehicles 10 to 40 km behind the line without fear, they own depth even if they lose 5x the men in trenches,” O’Leary wrote on X.\n\nIn truth, his accusation lays bare Ukraine’s two key structural challenges.\n\nFirstly, in drone technology, operating tactics and countermeasures, Russia has caught up and is quite possibly ahead.\n\nWriting on Facebook, Oleksandr Karpyuk, an aerial reconnaissance officer in the 59th Separate Assault Brigade, complained that Ukraine had failed to capitalize on its early advantage in this space, particularly by not diversifying the number of radio frequencies used by its drones to transmit signals.\n\nConsequently, once Russia improved its electronic warfare (EW) technologies, it needed to jam just two frequencies to put a significant dent in Ukraine’s ability to fly drones behind Russian lines.\n\nIn addition, Karpyuk writes, Russia’s tactical air defense crews are much improved, and Moscow continues to benefit from taking a lead in developing fiber-optic drones, which are impervious to Ukraine’s own EW countermeasures, because they do not transmit signals.\n\nAnd then there is Ukraine’s manpower issue.\n\nThe infantry shortage is well known. Rob Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute estimates there are fewer than ten Ukrainian infantry soldiers per kilometer of front line. He also estimates that most brigades have at most 10% of their total personnel in the infantry. Traditionally, that number would be upwards of 30%.\n\nLee told KI Insights, a strategic intelligence unit powered by the Kyiv Independent, that even those low numbers have been enough to prevent a major breakthrough by Russian forces, which have succeeded only in making small, incremental advances.\n\nBut in a war where drones - not infantry - matter most, it is Ukraine’s shortfalls in drone crews that are most pressing, especially in the key battle for operational depth – the destruction of targets up to 25 miles (40 kilometers) behind the line of combat.\n\nIn a forthright defense of the fighters under his command, the head of Ukraine’s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Forces, Robert Brovdi, said last week there needed to be a threefold increase in the number of drone operators. Just 30% of the frontline – which stretches 745 miles – is currently covered, he wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nFedorov, the new defense minister, acknowledges the scale of the problem, telling the Ukrainian parliament some 2 million people are ignoring their call-up papers, while 200,000 others have deserted.\n\nMuch now rests on his ability to address the manpower issue and to regain Ukraine’s technical edge, all the while ensuring he is hitting Zelensky’s targets.\n\n“Unless we constantly stay ahead of Russians in technology and battle tactics, I cannot say the chance we will prevail is high,” cautioned the former Ukrainian official.\n\nCNN’s Victoria Butenko and Daria Tarasova-Markina in Kyiv contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — There’s a chance the dreaded buzz of propellers heard on Ukrainian battlefields is coming from drones built in a country with a population of just over a million on Europe’s southeastern fringe: Cyprus.\n\nManufacturer Swarmly says there are more than 200 of its H-10 Poseidon drones helping Ukrainian artillery batteries pinpoint enemy targets on the ground in all kinds of weather, racking up more than 100,000 hours in the air over the last three years.\n\nIts 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) factory, where the whir of grinders shaping composite plastics reverberates off the walls, has become a major source of uncrewed vehicles shipped to countries such as Indonesia, Benin, Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia, according to company officials. Most of the factory floor is reserved for uncrewed aerial vehicle manufacture. But tucked in a secure storage area is a selection of Swarmly's super-fast marine drones replete with high-definition cameras and .50-caliber machine guns.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has driven even the smallest European Union member countries to develop their home-grown, high-tech defense industries, just as necessity has made Kyiv a world leader in cutting-edge UAV technology. Many EU countries have partnered with Kyiv to develop that technology, and Ukraine’s front lines are usually their testing grounds.\n\nLike Cyprus, the Baltic countries and Denmark have revved up their domestic drone and counter-drone technology. In Greece, drones are part of a 25-billion euro ($29-billion) overhaul of its armed forces.\n\n“The example of Swarmy, as well as other important companies based in small EU countries, is a testament to the serious effort made by the private sector in Europe to innovate and build mass production capacity of defense items, including uncrewed systems,” said Federico Borsari, an expert with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nUAVs are reshaping warfare by offering less militarily capable countries some leverage over superior adversaries. Drones aren't going to completely replace big-ticket weaponry like tanks, artillery and warplanes, said Borsari. But they offer flexibility and bang for the buck, making them a formidable force multiplier.\n\nTake Swarmly's explosives-packed, satellite-guided Hydra marine drone. Each one costs 80,000 euros ($94,500), which means deploying a group of them to neutralize a billion-euro warship can be a bargain, said company director Gary Rafalovsky.\n\nThis sort of naval weapon taking out a much larger warship is already evidenced by Houthi attacks from Yemen, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for missile technologies and UAVs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Europe.\n\nBarriers to entry for undercapitalized companies are low, he added, because UAVs are often designed and assembled from components cheaply and readily available on the global market.\n\n“And that, of course, means that basically you don’t have to have a great industrial investment at first that you need with other military capabilities. You don’t need decades of experience in certain material sciences or these kinds of things,” Hinz said.\n\nIn Denmark, a pair of companies focusing on anti-drone devices have reported a surge in new clients, and some of the devices were to be shipped to Ukraine to assist in jamming Russian technology on the battlefield. Ukraine in September said it was partnering with Danish companies to build missile and drone components at a factory in Denmark.\n\nIn the Baltic country of Lithuania, scientists and business partners have joined forces under the name VILNIUS TECH to develop UAVs, automated mine detection and other military technologies. The state-run ammunition factory Giraite says it has increased production capacity by 50% since 2022.\n\nGreece for the first time showcased its homemade drones and counter-drone technology during a full tactical exercise in November as NATO urged Europe's defense sector to pick up the pace.\n\n“We need capabilities, equipment, real firepower and the most advanced technology,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned during a visit to Romania earlier that month. “Bring your ideas, test your ingenuity and use NATO as your test bed.”\n\nEven as drone development accelerates, Borsari cautioned that the advantages of UAVs are often tempered by numerous variables like the harsh conditions in which they sometimes fly, operators’ training and skill levels, as well as the depth of logistical support to keep them functional.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the Trump administration’s mixed messages that have strained relations with NATO allies have forced European leaders to reckon with the need to become more self-reliant on defense. So the EU has made billions of euros available to encourage investment and bolster its collective deterrent capability.\n\nThat's been a boost to nations like Cyprus, which assumed the six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1. Last week, the EU’s executive arm approved financial assistance for eight members including Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is set to receive final approval from EU leaders for some 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in low-cost, long-term loans under the EU’s 150-billion-euro joint ($177-billion) procurement program called Security Action for Europe (SAFE).\n\nIts nascent defense industry is already made up of around 30 companies and research centers that produce technology for both civilian and military sectors, including robotics, communications networks, anti-drone systems and even satellite communications and surveillance, said Panayiotis Hadjipavlis, chief of the armaments and defense capabilities development directorate within Cyprus' Defense Ministry.\n\n“We have niche capabilities on very high-tech products and this has to be taken seriously into account,” Hadjipavlis told The Associated Press in his office, where the helmet from his fighter pilot days hung on a nearby coat rack.\n\nMajor defense industry players, he added, are among those who should take note.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Russia has largely observed a ceasefire on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as Kyiv prepared for the next round of trilateral talks on how ​to end the war.\n\nZelenskiy said that Russia had not carried out any targeted missile or drone strikes ‌on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the past 24 hours, but steady Russian shelling hit energy facilities near the front line.\n\n\"The de-escalation measures... are ‌helping to build public trust in the negotiation process and its possible outcome. The war needs to be ended,\" Zelenskiy said after he met his negotiating team ahead of the next round of peace talks with Russian and U.S. officials scheduled to take place this week in Abu Dhabi. \"Ukraine is ready for real steps. We believe it is realistic to achieve a ⁠dignified and lasting peace.\"\n\nIn his nightly ‌video address, Zelenskiy noted that Russian forces had continued to shell Ukrainian positions and logistics, damaging transmission lines and other sites in parts of the southeastern Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nHe ‍said the pause in strikes on energy infrastructure underscored the fact that U.S. efforts to pursue negotiations to end the war were having an impact.\n\n\"This demonstrates that when the United States has the motivation to genuinely change the situation, the situation can indeed ​change,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nRussia and Ukraine said last week they halted strikes on each other's energy infrastructure, but disagreed ‌on the timeframe for the truce.\n\nThe Kremlin said U.S. President Donald Trump had made a personal request to Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from striking Kyiv until February 1. Zelenskiy said the truce was supposed to last for a week, starting January 30.\n\nUKRAINE STRUGGLES TO RESTORE POWER SUPPLIES\n\nUkraine is struggling to restore its battered energy system and secure electricity and heat for the population after several large Russian strikes this month. Repair work has been complicated by ⁠bitterly cold temperatures.\n\n\"Today we are coming to the critical point. We ​need some time to recover what is destroyed for the last ​three months,\" said Maxim Timchenko, CEO of private energy producer DTEK. \"Energy ceasefire is extremely important for us to recover partly and avoid any tragic consequences because of no power supply.\"\n\nDTEK said on ‍Monday one of its coal ⁠mining enterprises in the Dnipropetrovsk region had been attacked for the second time in 24 hours. The previous strike on Sunday killed 12 miners, the company said.\n\nZelenskiy also said Russian forces were focusing on ⁠attacking transport logistics, especially railway infrastructure.\n\nRegional officials said that a Russian strike had killed a father and a son, and wounded two children and ‌their mother in the frontline Donetsk region.",

    "description": "The Meteor is a powerful weapon that Ukraine says would give it a fighting chance against the aircraft carrying highly destructive glide bombs.",
    "fullText": "A future Ukrainian fleet of Gripen fighter jets could be armed with Europe's best air-to-air missile, giving Kyiv a powerful new weapon to strike Russian aircraft from a distance.\n\nMykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's defense minister, and his Swedish counterpart discussed the possibility of Stockholm sending JAS 39 Gripen jets and Meteor missiles to Kyiv in a call on Sunday.\n\nThese long-range air-to-air missiles \"are key tools for countering aircraft carriers of guided aerial bombs,\" the Ukrainian defense ministry said in a readout of the call. The Russian bombs are problematic for Kyiv because they can be launched from standoff ranges and are very difficult to intercept.\n\nThe Meteor is a beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile developed by the European multinational defense corporation MBDA and is widely considered the best such weapon made on the continent.\n\nThe 12-foot-long Meteor weighs more than 400 pounds and is fired from a number of fighter jets, including the Swedish Gripen, the French Rafale, and the European Eurofighter Typhoon. It can travel more than 75 miles and exceed Mach 4 (3,000 miles per hour).\n\nGuided by an active radar seeker, the Meteor uses an air-breathing jet engine to stay fast all the way to the intercept, giving it what MBDA says is the largest \"no-escape zone\" of any air-to-air missile. Unlike many long-range missiles that lose speed late in flight, Meteor retains its energy, making it far harder for a target aircraft to evade.\n\nSweden, one of only a handful of countries that has armed its fighter jets with the Meteor, was the first to put the missile into service in 2016.\n\nThe discussions on the Meteor come more than three months after Ukraine and Sweden signed a letter of intent to export up to 150 Gripen fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nThe deal is not yet finalized. However, the potential arms acquisition would significantly help modernize Ukraine's air force, which mostly consists of aging Soviet-era fighters, as well as a small batch of American F-16s and French Mirage 2000s.\n\nThe Gripen, manufactured by Swedish aerospace and defense giant Saab, is considered by airpower experts to be the ideal Western fighter jet for Ukraine because it is designed to operate from austere airstrips and requires minimal maintenance, better supporting dispersed operations than some other airframes.\n\nWhile no decision appears to have been made regarding the Meteor missile, recent discussions between Fedorov and his counterpart, Pål Jonson, suggest the transfer could be included in future weapons packages.\n\nUkraine's defense ministry said in the call readout on Sunday that Sweden is preparing a \"large-scale\" aid package for Ukraine that is set to include air defense systems, radars, electronic warfare systems, and drones.",

But breaking the deadlock on key issues appears no closer as the fourth anniversary of Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor approaches later this month.\n\nPeskov described the talks as “very complex.”\n\n“On some issues, we have certainly come closer because there have been discussions, conversations, and on some issues it is easier to find common ground,” he told reporters. “There are issues where it’s more difficult to find common ground.”\n\nRussian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev was in Miami, Florida, at the weekend for talks with American officials, but Peskov refused to provide any details of the meeting.\n\nA key sticking point is whether Russia gets to keep the Ukrainian territory its army has occupied, especially in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. Moscow is also demanding possession of other Ukrainian land there that it hasn’t been able to capture.\n\nRussian drones and missiles have continued to bombard civilian areas , killing 12 miners in a bus on Sunday in the most recent mass aerial attack. The barrages have also wrecked the Ukrainian power grid, leaving people without heating, light and running water in bitter winter cold.\n\nDefense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Monday that authorities are taking steps to prevent Russia using Starlink satellite services to steer its drones toward their targets.\n\nFedorov asked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to help deny Russia use of the service in Ukraine. Starlink is a global internet network that relies on around 10,000 satellites orbiting Earth.\n\nUkraine is requiring civilian and military Starlink users to register their terminals on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals would be disabled inside Ukraine, Fedorov said.\n\n“Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorized use of Starlink by Russia have worked,” Musk said Sunday on X. “Let us know if more needs to be done.”\n\nLitvinova contributed from Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — European allies and Canada are pouring billions of dollars into helping Ukraine, and they have pledged to massively boost their budgets to defend their territories.\n\nBut despite those efforts, NATO’s credibility as a unified force under U.S. leadership has taken a huge hit over the past year as trust within the 32-nation military organization dissolved.\n\nThe rift has been most glaring over U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated threats to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. More recently, Trump's disparaging remarks about his NATO allies' troops in Afghanistan drew another outcry.\n\nWhile the heat on Greenland has subsided for now, the infighting has seriously undercut the ability of the world’s biggest security alliance to deter adversaries, analysts say.\n\n“The episode matters because it crossed a line that cannot be uncrossed,” Sophia Besch from the Carnegie Europe think tank said in a report on the Greenland crisis. “Even without force or sanctions, that breach weakens the alliance in a lasting way.”\n\nThe tensions haven’t gone unnoticed in Russia, NATO’s biggest threat.\n\nAny deterrence of Russia relies on ensuring that President Vladimir Putin is convinced that NATO will retaliate should he expand his war beyond Ukraine. Right now, that does not seem to be the case.\n\n“It’s a major upheaval for Europe, and we are watching it,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted last week.\n\nCriticized by U.S. leaders for decades over low defense spending, and lashed relentlessly under Trump, European allies and Canada agreed in July to significantly up their game and start investing 5% of their gross domestic product on defense.\n\nThe pledge was aimed at taking the whip out of Trump's hand. The allies would spend as much of their economic output on core defense as the United States — around 3.5% of GDP — by 2035, plus a further 1.5% on security-related projects like upgrading bridges, air and seaports.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has hailed those pledges as a sign of NATO’s robust health and military might. He recently said that “fundamentally thanks to Donald J. Trump, NATO is stronger than it ever was.”\n\nThough a big part of his job is to ensure that Trump does not pull the U.S. out of NATO, as Trump has occasionally threatened, his flattery of the American leader has sometimes raised concern. Rutte has pointedly refused to speak about the rift over Greenland.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed in 1949 to counter the security threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and its deterrence is underpinned by a strong American troop presence in Europe.\n\nThe alliance is built on the political pledge that an attack on one ally must be met with a response from them all — the collective security guarantee enshrined in Article 5 of its rule book.\n\nIt hinges on the belief that the territories of all 32 allies must remain inviolate. Trump’s designs on Greenland attack that very principle, even though Article 5 does not apply in internal disputes because it can only be triggered unanimously.\n\n“Instead of strengthening our alliances, threats against Greenland and NATO are undermining America’s own interests,” two U.S. senators, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Lisa Murkowski, wrote in a New York Times op-ed.\n\n“Suggestions that the United States would seize or coerce allies to sell territory do not project strength. They signal unpredictability, weaken deterrence and hand our adversaries exactly what they want: proof that democratic alliances are fragile and unreliable,” they said.\n\nEven before Trump escalated his threats to seize control of Greenland, his European allies were never entirely convinced that he would defend them should they come under attack.\n\nTrump has said that he doesn’t believe the allies would help him either, and he recently drew more anger when he questioned the role of European and Canadian troops who fought and died alongside Americans in Afghanistan. The president later partially reversed his remarks.\n\nIn testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed criticism that Trump has undermined the alliance.\n\n“The stronger our partners are in NATO, the more flexibility the United States will have to secure our interests in different parts of the world,” he said. “That’s not an abandonment of NATO. That is a reality of the 21st century and a world that’s changing now.”\n\nDespite NATO’s talk of increased spending, Moscow seems undeterred. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said this week that “it has become painfully clear that Russia will remain a major security threat for the long term.”\n\n“We are fending off cyberattacks, sabotage against critical infrastructure, foreign interference and information manipulation, military intimidation, territorial threats and political meddling,” she said Wednesday.\n\nOfficials across Europe have reported acts of sabotage and mysterious drone flights over airports and military bases. Identifying the culprits is difficult, and Russia denies responsibility.\n\nIn a year-end address, Rutte warned that Europe is at imminent risk.\n\n“Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, Lavrov said the dispute over Greenland heralded a “deep crisis” for NATO.\n\n“It was hard to imagine before that such a thing could happen,” Lavrov told reporters, as he contemplated the possibility that “one NATO member is going to attack another NATO member.”\n\nRussian state media mocked Europe's “impotent rage” over Trump's designs on Greenland, and Putin's presidential envoy declared that “trans-Atlantic unity is over.”\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is due to meet with his counterparts at NATO on Feb. 12. A year ago, he startled the allies by warning that America’s security priorities lie elsewhere and that Europe must look after itself now.\n\nSecurity in the Arctic region, where Greenland lies, will be high on the agenda. It’s unclear whether Hegseth will announce a new drawdown of U.S. troops in Europe, who are central to NATO’s deterrence.\n\nLack of clarity about this has also fueled doubt about the U.S. commitment to its allies. In October, NATO learned that up to 1,500 American troops would be withdrawn from an area bordering Ukraine, angering ally Romania.\n\nA report from the European Union Institute for Security Studies warned last week that although U.S. troops are unlikely to vanish overnight, doubts about U.S. commitment to European security means “the deterrence edifice becomes shakier.”\n\n“Europe is being forced to confront a harsher reality,” wrote the authors, Veronica Anghel and Giuseppe Spatafora. “Adversaries start believing they can probe, sabotage and escalate without triggering a unified response.\"",

    "title": "Infantry will still be fighting in muddy holes even as drones change war, British officer says",
    "description": "Ukraine is showing how much drones can change the battle. But a British unit going all-in on them said much about war remains unchanged.",
    "fullText": "A British military unit that is leaning heavily into drones says that even though the technology may be the future of war, it probably won't fundamentally change most of infantry life as it is now, at least not anytime soon.\n\nThe Irish Guards, an elite infantry regiment within the British Army, have been preparing intensively to operate with drones after watching the heavy drone use in Ukraine and receiving advice from Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nBut Lt. Col Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of its 1st Battalion, told Business Insider that he believes most of an infantryman's job likely won't change even as drone technology proliferates.\n\n\"To me, it feels like 80% of the job of an infantryman is exactly the same and probably exactly the same as it was in a Napoleonic era,\" he said. \"You need to be fit. You need to be strong and robust. You need to be able to survive in the field. You need to be able to dig a hole.\"\n\n\"That hasn't changed,\" he said. \"I doubt it's going to change for a while longer.\"\n\nHe said that land warfare and infantry combat tend to be \"regressive,\" which is to say \"it doesn't matter how much technology you throw into the field, it doesn't matter how supremely trained your troops are. Sooner or later it ends up as two blokes in a muddy hole, slugging it out with a billhook or a spade.\"\n\n\"Once the tank's gone, you just regress to the next type of technology,\" he said — and eventually to soldiers on foot. \"So I don't think a huge majority of the job has changed.\"\n\nThat continuity, Irwin-Clark said, is reassuring rather than limiting. It means new technology can be layered onto an existing foundation rather than replacing it.\n\nStill, his unit is heavily embracing drones, driven by lessons from Ukraine and direct Ukrainian input.\n\nIrwin-Clark said that out of the 300 people in the battalion, 78 are now pilots or instructors. It has also created a \"drone hub,\" the first of its kind in the British Army, where soldiers can repair drones and develop new ones using tech like 3D printing, a technology it adopted on Ukrainian advice. It now uses drones in its exercises and has created a drone obstacle course for soldiers to train on.\n\nThe British officer isn't alone in his thinking on the impact of drones on war and the infantry.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, director of the US Army's Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course designed to help the service catch up on drone warfare, told Business Insider that \"yes, warfare, the tools of warfare are changing, but the fundamentals of warfare have not changed.\"\n\nDrones, she said, are \"just another tool with which to combat specific types of missions, but not necessarily all missions,\" and other weaponry that the US Army has had for much longer may still be able to accomplish missions better than drones can.\n\nShe said she wants soldiers to view drones \"as a tool with which to accomplish a mission, but it may not be the tool given a certain mission set.\"\n\nGen. James Rainey, the former head of Army Futures Command, said in 2024 that technology like drones was having a majorly disruptive effect on land warfare and was something the US needed to get ahead of, but he also said that war will \"always be a human endeavor.\"\n\nDrones may not dominate future Western wars as they do in Ukraine — where shortages forced heavy reliance on them — but NATO militaries are still investing in drones and training to ensure they're ready to use them where they make sense.\n\nEven though he doesn't see much of infantry life changing, Irwin-Clark still described drones as being part of \"the future of warfare.\"\n\nHe said that what surprised him most was how quickly his battalion's members picked up the technology.\n\n\"Everything else that you learned in the army is a sort of quite laborious process of fixed lessons, right?\" he said. He said that things are done by the book, because those styles of warfare have been around for so long that \"there is literally a book.\"\n\nAfter 20 years in the army, he was used to a more formulaic approach to training. But with drone warfare, \"you can't do that because the text's changing all the time and the types of drones are changing all the time.\" He was fearful as a result that it would take quite a while for the battalion to get it. Instead, he was \"pretty blown away\" by how quickly soldiers were confidently flying using drones.\n\nHe said that the men and women in the battalion \"are incredible and can pick that up really quickly. They're really adaptable, and they are really tech savvy.\"",

    "title": "Russia's Oil Revenue, the Lifeblood of Its War Machine, Is Plummeting",
    "description": "The new reality has forced the Kremlin to raise taxes and increase debt, and hovers over peace talks with Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "As Russia holds direct peace talks with Ukraine for the first time in months, the Kremlin’s most potent fuel for the war, oil revenue, is under mounting strain.\n\nThe price of Russian oil, the country’s primary export, has declined under the weight of surging global supplies and Western sanctions related to the war. Last year, Russia’s oil and gas revenue fell by almost a quarter, according to the Finance Ministry. The Kremlin is resorting to tax increases and deficit spending to bridge the gap.\n\nSo far, there is little sign that the economic strains, and any discontent they generate among business leaders and the public, will be enough to change President Vladimir V. Putin’s calculations on the war. Trilateral negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine and the United States are set to continue on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBut with the economy stagnating and the Kremlin reaching the limit of what it can squeeze from it, the Russian people will have to bear more of the burden of a war whose costs exceed about $170 billion a year.\n\n“This situation is manageable,” said Yevgeny Nadorshin, an economist in Moscow who advises companies and banks. “But no one is comfortable with that.”\n\nThroughout his decades-long rule, Mr. Putin has taken pride in the stability he has brought to a Russian economy that was in free fall after the demise of the Soviet Union — slashing debt, streamlining taxes and taming inflation.\n\nA strong oil economy allowed the Russian state to deliver an improved standard of living. That, the Kremlin hoped, would keep the public content even as the government eroded personal freedoms.\n\nNow, the carefully cultivated economic stability is fracturing. The steep drop in oil revenue has sent Russia into a new era defined by sustained budget deficits, higher taxes and stubborn inflation.\n\nRussia’s oil trade has been battered by two forces. Oil prices have declined since April, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to gradually increase production after years of cuts. The Russian oil industry has also been hit in recent months by new Western sanctions and the heavier enforcement of existing ones.\n\nIn October, President Trump imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft, which is state-owned, and Lukoil, which is private. Those penalties significantly undercut the companies’ ability to sell crude. Since then, Russia has also faced stepped-up enforcement of restrictions against the illicit “shadow fleet” of tankers it uses to ship oil.\n\nThis month, the U.S. military seized a Russian-flagged vessel in the North Atlantic that had been used to carry Venezuelan oil. The French Navy also intercepted a tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of using a false flag and belonging to a Russia-linked fleet.\n\nBecause of the current global oversupply, buyers now have more alternatives to Russian crude. This allows them to either walk away entirely or demand significantly higher discounts to compensate for the risk of handling goods hit with sanctions, said Sergey Vakulenko, an energy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n“Had it not been for this noticeable decrease in oil prices,” he said, “all these measures would have been far less effective.”\n\nDiscounts on Russian oil have grown drastically. The economy ministry said this month that the average price of Russian oil was $39 per barrel in December, down from more than $57 in August.\n\nAdding to Moscow’s problems, Ukraine has been using drones since November to strike Russia-linked tankers in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Ukrainian military has also been attacking Russian refineries. That has contributed to fuel crises in several regions, forcing the government to temporarily ban the export of oil products.\n\n“The only factor that can change the situation is economic pressure on Russia,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Friday. “Russia must run out of money for the war to start coming to an end.”\n\nThis is not the first time that Mr. Putin has dealt with a drop in oil prices. But in previous years, the Russian state had more options. It could cut expenditures or allow the currency to weaken to replenish the budget. But the costs of the war, which amount to about 30 percent of Russia’s $580 billion annual budget, make it hard to reduce expenses. And the currency, the ruble, has remained strong.\n\nPropped up by restrictions on imports and high interest rates, the ruble surged by about 45 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2025. A strong ruble means that the government receives less money for each barrel of crude that is sold.\n\nWith options dwindling, the Kremlin had little choice but to increase state debt as well as personal and corporate taxes. The Russian government also increased taxes on smaller enterprises like bakeries and shops, causing a rare uproar among owners.\n\nRussia’s budget deficit reached $72 billion in 2025, nominally the highest since 2009. Mr. Nadorshin, the economist, said he expected it to increase further this year.\n\n“The situation is becoming more complicated,” he said, “and it’s clear that the pace of this complication is, naturally, worrying.”",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The terms of a Russian commitment to U.S. President Donald Trump to temporarily halt its bombardment of Ukraine during one of the country's bleakest winters in years remained unclear Friday, as Ukrainians braced for even worse conditions to come next week.\n\nTrump said late Thursday that President Vladimir Putin had agreed to a temporary pause in targeting Kyiv and other places as the region experiences freezing temperatures that have brought widespread hardship to civilians.\n\n“I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week during this ... extraordinary cold,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. Putin has “agreed to that,” he said, without elaborating on when the request to the Russian leader was made.\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a query seeking clarity about the scope and timing of any limited pause.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed Friday that Trump “made a personal request” to Putin to stop targeting Kyiv until Feb. 1 “in order to create favorable conditions for negotiations.”\n\nThe mention of Feb. 1 was confusing since that is only two days away. Also, the cold weather is forecast to get much worse from Sunday, with temperatures dropping even further and making the time frame for a pause in attacks hard to understand.\n\nRussia has sought to deny Ukrainian civilians heat, light and running water over the course of the war, in a strategy that Ukrainian officials describe as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nAsked if Moscow agreed to Trump’s proposal, Peskov said, “Yes, of course.” But he refused to answer further questions about whether the agreement covered only energy infrastructure or all aerial strikes, and when the halt on strikes was supposed to start.\n\nRussia struck Ukrainian energy assets in several regions of Ukraine on Thursday but there were no strikes on those facilities overnight, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday.\n\nIn a post on social media, Zelenskyy also noted that Russia has turned its attention to targeting Ukrainian logistics networks and that Russian drones and missiles hit residential areas of Ukraine overnight, as they have most nights during the war.\n\nTrump framed Putin's acceptance as a concession. But Zelenskyy was skeptical as Russia’s invasion approaches its fourth anniversary on Feb. 24 with no sign that Moscow is willing to reach a peace settlement despite a U.S.-led push to end the fighting.\n\n“I do not believe that Russia wants to end the war. There is a great deal of evidence to the contrary,” Zelenskyy said Thursday. Ukraine is ready to halt its attacks on Russia’s energy infrastructure, including oil refineries, if Moscow also stops its bombardment of the Ukrainian power grid and other energy assets, he said.\n\nRussia fired 111 drones and one ballistic missile at Ukraine overnight, injuring at least three people, the Ukrainian Air Force said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that its air defenses overnight shot down 18 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions, as well as the illegally annexed Crimea and the Black Sea.\n\nForecasters say Kyiv, which recently endured severe power shortages, will see a brutally cold stretch starting Friday that is expected to last into next week. Temperatures in some areas will drop to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit), the State Emergency Service said.\n\nThe possibility of a respite in energy sector attacks was discussed at last weekend’s meeting in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, between envoys of Ukraine, Russia and the United States, Zelenskyy said, adding that he had agreed to adhere to a “reciprocal approach” on energy assaults.\n\n“If Russia does not strike us, we will … take corresponding steps,” he told reporters.\n\nFurther talks were expected on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, but that could change because of a spike in tensions between the United States and Iran.\n\nIt was unclear whether and how any partial truce might work amid ongoing wider fighting and mistrust between the two countries.\n\n“There is no ceasefire. There is no official agreement on a ceasefire, as is typically reached during negotiations,” Zelenskyy said. “There has been no direct dialogue and no direct agreements on this matter between us and Russia.”\n\nUkraine had originally proposed a limited energy ceasefire at talks in Saudi Arabia last year, Zelenskyy said, but it gained no traction.\n\nDisagreement over what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory, and Moscow’s demand for possession of territory it hasn’t captured, are a key issue holding up a peace deal, according to Zelenskyy.\n\n“We have repeatedly said that we are ready for compromises that lead to a real end to the war, but that are in no way related to changes to Ukraine’s territorial integrity,” Zelenskyy said. “The American side understands this and says that there is a compromise solution regarding a free economic zone.”\n\nUkraine demands control over such a zone, he said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "The Security Service of Ukraine claims that its drones struck at least 15 Russian aircraft on airfields last year.",
    "fullText": "As both sides in the war in Ukraine continue their campaigns of long-range drone attacks, the Ukrainian government’s internal security agency has released a compilation of strikes directed against Russian airbases. The video, published by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), records drone strikes against Russian military aircraft by its special forces unit, the “Alpha Group,” also known as “A” Special Operations Center.\n\nHere is the Ukrainian video, released by SBU Alfa unit, by the way. https://t.co/dM7FBC5Ntf pic.twitter.com/vbdMqFIHmK\n\n— Yaroslav Trofimov (@yarotrof) January 29, 2026\n\n“The enemy is used to feeling safe in the deep rear. But for the special forces of “Alpha,” distance has long ceased to matter,” the SBU wrote in a post accompanying the video on social media.\n\nThe footage shows several Russian aircraft being targeted, from the perspective of the attacking drones. It appears that most, if not all, of these strikes were previously claimed, and some have been previously seen in the form of video stills. But the end result is certainly impressive, presuming all of the targeted aircraft were damaged or destroyed — which is far from clear from these videos.\n\nThe SBU claims that the total value of the damage was more than $1 billion, although it’s far from clear how this was calculated, especially since some of the airframes in question are decades old and no longer in production. It’s also notable that the SBU figure includes damage inflicted on ammunition and fuel depots at the airfields in question.\n\nRegardless, the 15 aircraft claimed targeted by the SBU appear to comprise:\n\n11 fixed-wing combat aircraft: Su-30SM Flanker (two), Su-27 Flanker (two), Su-24 Fencer (perhaps as many as five), and MiG-31 Foxhound (two);\n\n3 helicopters: Mi-8 Hip, Mi-26 Halo, and Mi-28 Havoc (one each);\n\n1 transport aircraft: An-26 Curl.\n\nFrom what can be seen, the An-26 appears to have been damaged beyond repair, while one Su-24 seems to have had at least its tail section damaged; available satellite imagery may show a destroyed Su-24, but the quality of the imagery means that it can’t be determined for sure.\n\nThese aircraft were targeted at five different airfields, the SBU stated, without disclosing their exact locations.\n\nHowever, based on open-source analysis, it seems that the targeted bases included Belbek, Kirovskoye, Saky, and Simferopol, all in Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nMi-8MTV-5M attacked at Kirovskoye Air Base (45.166855, 35.192407). This is the one that was destroyed on 28 June 2025. https://t.co/kizTFk1EP6 pic.twitter.com/dlR9pp5xF1\n\n— The Military Watch (@MarcinRogowsk14) January 28, 2026\n\nThe growing threat of attacks like these on airbases has prompted Russia to build new hardened aircraft shelters and embark on additional construction to help shield aircraft from drone strikes and other indirect fire. This is part of a broader push by the Russian military to improve physical defenses at multiple airfields following the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe highlighted airfield raids in the video are part of a wider Ukrainian drone campaign carried out last year, in which the SBU also targeted Russian air defense systems, radar installations, and critical energy infrastructure.\n\nAs far as air defense systems are concerned, the SBU claims that it destroyed Russian equipment worth an estimated $4 billion last year. These included S-300, S-350, and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, as well as advanced radar systems such as the Nebo-M, Podlet, and Protivnik-GE.\n\nIn 2025, Ukraine also carried out the spectacular Operation Spiderweb, a large-scale Ukrainian drone strike against airbases across Russia in June. This targeted Moscow’s fleet of strategic bombers and saw a reported 117 drones launched against at least four airfields.\n\nNotable also is the fact that the specific Ukrainian campaign against Russian airfields is something that was brought up by U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, last summer. The timing of that call suggests that Operation Spiderweb prompted that discussion.\n\nLots of people are reposting this Trump Truth Social post as if it’s recent (in part because Ukraine just released another video of hitting parked Russian warplanes), but it is in fact from last summer. pic.twitter.com/8jodT8bm7H\n\n— Yaroslav Trofimov (@yarotrof) January 29, 2026\n\nUkraine’s ability to strike high-value Russian targets at considerable range has been bolstered through the addition of long-range cruise missiles, as well as an expanding inventory of attack drones, both large and small.\n\nMeanwhile, SBU is continuing its long-range drone strikes.\n\nOvernight on January 13, the security agency teamed up with the Ukrainian Navy to attack a drone production facility in Taganrog, where several production halls appear to have been destroyed, based on satellite analysis.\n\nUkrainian Defenders destroyed several warehouses of Atlant Aero plant in Taganrog, Russia. Combat drones and their parts were produced there.\n\nGlory! pic.twitter.com/P6RcfpXtbl\n\n— Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) January 16, 2026\n\nThe facility in question, the Atlant Aero factory, is responsible, among others, for producing Russia’s Molniya loitering munition, widely used in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly hit a Russian drone factory in the city of Taganrog tonight, setting it ablaze. \n\nMultiple explosions were reported at the Atlant drone company, manufacturer of the Molniya-series attack drones. pic.twitter.com/yr3SA3b7gV\n\n— OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) January 13, 2026\n\nDrones being used to strike enemy facilities producing drones is very much indicative of the path the war has taken, when it comes to the increasing use and diversity of uncrewed systems across all fronts.\n\nFor its part, Russia employed a BM-35 loitering munition to attack what was claimed by some observers to be a Ukrainian F-16 fighter at Kanatove Air Base in Ukraine’s Kirovohrad region, on January 26. In fact, the target was either a decoy or a ground-instructional aid, something that even Russia’s Rubicon Drone Operations Center attested to.\n\nRussian BM-35 kamikaze drone with Starlink hits Ukrainain F-16 decoy at Kanatove airfield, Kirovohrad region. pic.twitter.com/LpQyXUlvPZ\n\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) January 29, 2026\n\nThis is not the first time that a Russian drone strike has claimed a Ukrainian aircraft mock-up, but again demonstrates the potential vulnerability of airfields to these kinds of attacks.\n\nNotably, too, the BM-35 drone used in the strike is reported to use satellite connectivity via Starlink, allowing operators to control it in real time over long distances.\n\nThe SBU’s latest ‘greatest hits’ compilation underscores how drone attacks on Russian military aircraft are one of its highest priorities and one that we will certainly see targeted again in the months to come.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

Musk turned on Starlink service over Ukraine in 2022 ‍after Kyiv pleaded for help in the first days following Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nDespite Musk's subsequent clashes with Ukrainian officials over his views on the war, Ukraine's military still relies on tens of thousands of Starlinks for battlefield communication and for piloting ​some drone missions.\n\nThey are favoured for their stable connection on the battlefield and for their resistance to ‌enemy signal jamming.\n\nIn a social media post in February 2024, SpaceX said it does not sell or ship Starlink to Russia, and \"does not do business of any kind with the Russian Government or its military\".\n\nThe U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said it had seen reports of Russia using Starlink-equipped Shahed long-range drones beginning in September 2024.\n\n'HUNDREDS' OF STARLINK-EQUIPPED DRONES\n\nSerhiy Beskrestnov, a newly appointed adviser to Fedorov, drew attention to the issue ⁠over the past week by posting pictures on social media ​of the wreckage of long-range Russian drones, including Shaheds, with Starlink ​terminals.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beskrestnov said that Shahed drones manually flown by pilots, possibly through Starlink, had attacked a passenger train in northeastern Ukraine. That attack killed five people, and was denounced ‍by Kyiv as an act ⁠of terrorism.\n\nOn Thursday, Beskrestnov said there had been \"hundreds\" of cases where Starlink-enabled Russian drones had attacked Ukraine.\n\n\"The complexity of this process lies in the fact that Starlink cannot be suppressed by means of ⁠electronic warfare, and even their position in flight cannot be detected by reconnaissance equipment,\" he wrote, adding that the way to solve ‌the issue was therefore through SpaceX.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A new report warns that the number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could hit 2 million by the spring, with Russia suffering the largest number of troop deaths recorded for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nTuesday's report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nAs the war grinds through another bitterly cold winter, Russian strikes hit an apartment block Wednesday on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing two people. Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe CSIS report said Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025.\n\n“Despite claims of battlefield momentum in Ukraine, the data shows that Russia is paying an extraordinary price for minimal gains and is in decline as a major power,” the report said. “No major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II.\"\n\nIt estimated that Ukraine, with its smaller army and population, had suffered between 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each side seeks to amplify the other side’s casualties.\n\nCommenting on the report, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the research could not be considered “reliable information” and that only Russia’s Ministry of Defense was authorized to provide information on military losses.\n\nThe ministry’s last statement on battlefield deaths was in September 2022, when it said that just under 6,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. It has not released any updated figures since then.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn an interview with NBC in February 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the war began.\n\nThe report estimated that at current rates, combined Russian and Ukrainian casualties may be as high as 1.8 million and could reach 2 million by spring.\n\nThe figures from the CSIS were compiled using the Washington, D.C.-based think tank’s own analysis, data published by independent Russian news site Mediazona with the BBC, estimates by the British government and interviews with state officials.\n\nReports about military losses have been repressed in Russian media, activists and independent journalists say.\n\nMediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, has so far collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed by scouring news reports, social media and government websites.\n\nThe report also said that Russian forces were advancing at a sluggish pace since they seized the initiative on the battlefield in 2024, despite their much larger size.\n\nRussia’s advance in Ukraine has largely settled into a grinding war of attrition, and analysts say that Russian President Vladimir Putin is in no rush to find a settlement, despite his army’s difficulties on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.\n\nThe report said Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters (49 to 230 feet) per day in their most prominent offensives.\n\nThat is “slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century,” the report said.\n\nPutin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure — 617,000 — in December 2023. It was not possible to verify those figures.\n\n2 killed in attack in Kyiv region\n\nOfficials said Wednesday that two people were killed near the Ukrainian capital and at least nine others were injured in attacks across Ukraine.\n\nA man and a woman died in an overnight attack in the Bilohorodka area on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to Mykola Kalashnyk, head of the regional military administration.\n\nOfficials in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih, as well as the Zaporizhzhia region, also reported Russian strikes overnight, wounding at least nine people and damaging infrastructure.\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia attacked overnight with one ballistic missile and 146 strike drones, 103 of which were shot down or destroyed using electronic warfare.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense said its air defenses destroyed 75 Ukrainian drones overnight. Twenty-four were shot down over Russia’s southwestern Krasnodar region, with 23 more shot down over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2016.\n\nTwo drones were reportedly shot down over Russia's Voronezh region, where Ukraine's General Staff said Wednesday that it had struck the Khokholskaya oil depot. Regional Gov. Alexander Gusev wrote on Telegram that falling drone debris sparked a fire involving oil products, but did not give further details.",

    "description": "Ukraine's drone schools are closely following the fast-developing drone battle and say their expertise only comes from Ukrainians, not Western allies.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian drone schools say that Western militaries have little to offer them when it comes to training drone operators to fight Russia. Western armies know war, tactics, and combat power, but Ukraine has significant experience in novel elements of modern drone warfare learned over years of hard fighting.\n\nDrones of all kinds are used \n\nWhile drones are not new to Western militaries, they have never been used or adapted at this scale or speed. Facing an existential adapt-or-die situation, Ukraine is writing its own lessons.\n\nUkraine has a host of drone schools that have designed curricula to make the country's operators as effective as possible. And officials at three of them told Business Insider that their lessons are only informed by Ukrainian experiences.\n\n\"As of today, we do not receive any particularly useful information from our allies regarding the use of drones,\" other than training on any equipment that allies provide, one said.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that said 100% of his school's teachings come from feedback or information from soldiers who are in the field.\n\nOne example he gave was in stopping enemy drones: \"All experience in striking down drones is based only on the experience of the Ukrainian Defense Forces.\"\n\nHe said there isn't time for theoretical tactics that may not work when needed most. \"We are in a situation where we need to respond quickly to new drones and the tactics of their use by the enemy,\" he said. \"Accordingly, techniques are being tested in practice, and only those techniques that really work are being retained.\"\n\nAnother drone school, Dronarium, said the school's training \"is based on existing combat experience, which changes very rapidly.\"\n\nBecause of that pace, instructors said Ukraine is often better positioned to share lessons than to receive them. \"In this sense, at the moment it is rather us who can share valuable information with them, rather than our foreign partners sharing it with us,\" Anastasia Sobova, Dronarium Academy's chief business development officer, told BI.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have been receiving Western training throughout the war, with mixed feedback. Some has been well received, while other elements have been deemed irrelevant to the kind of fighting Ukraine faces now.\n\nUkraine's troops say combat tactics can become out of date in a matter of only weeks; the drone war is no different.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of the US arm of DroneShield, a company making counter-drone systems for the US and Europe, recently told Business Insider that the speed of battlefield changes has shifted weapon development cycles from months and years to weeks.\n\nThings change so fast on the battlefield that the schools need to frequently rewrite their lessons, sometimes as fast as every other week.\n\nThese drone schools stay on top of changes by sending their instructors to the front, maintaining constant contact with program graduates and other soldiers who send updates from the battlefield, and testing new technology.\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, said that his school's graduates exchange messages with the school to share new information about what's happening on the battlefield or get advice from teachers.\n\n\"Cadets go to the front line, type questions in those chats, or provide information about new enemy tactics.\" The information they get from those on the front line goes into the teaching for the next groups.\n\nPervak said in his school, \"We constantly update our instructors' knowledge. Some instructors occasionally visit combat units of the UAV to see firsthand what has changed, what remains relevant, and what can be discarded.\"\n\nMany Western militaries, including the US, acknowledge they are behind on drone warfare and that their tactics need updating. It is an area where Ukraine is helping partner nations that have assisted it in its defense.\n\nWestern and NATO militaries are closely watching the war, concerned that Russia could threaten Europe and that drones would play a major role in any wider conflict. That worry has intensified efforts to learn from Ukraine's experience, particularly in drone operations and counter-drone tactics. The Ukrainians are attempting to meet that demand for expertise.\n\nUkraine agreed to help Poland with drone warfare training and has helped train Norway's drone operators.\n\nUkrainian military specialists traveled to Denmark to participate in counter-drone exercises. Copenhagen said in April it intended to send unarmed soldiers to Ukraine for drone warfare training, though it is unclear if that has taken place.\n\nThe UK says Ukraine has influenced its drone doctrine as well. Britain leads an international effort to train Ukrainian troops, known as Operation Interflex, and those Ukrainian soldiers often arrive with more real-world drone experience than their trainers.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the UK's Irish Guards, told Business Insider that one surprise from the training was \"how much we would learn.\" His unit now trains in drone warfare and 3D printing drone parts based on Ukrainian lessons.\n\nPervak described sharing expertise as a way to repay allies for their support. \"Not forgetting the fact that we are truly grateful for the remarkable support from our allies, it is time now to share our latest battlefield experience.\"\n\nDrones might not dominate a NATO war against Russia to the same extent they do in Ukraine — in part because Western militaries possess capabilities Ukraine lacks — but they are no longer viewed as a niche tool. Ukraine's experience has led to a realization that this tech may very well be the future of warfare.",

    "title": "Ukraine's new 35-year-old defense minister made 2 influential Telegram bloggers his advisors for drone warfare",
    "description": "In a major shift for Ukraine's military, Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko are now officially advising Kyiv on defense tech and drones.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, has appointed two prominent Telegram bloggers and activists to his \"team of new leaders,\" saying they will advise him on defense technology and drone warfare.\n\nThe move is a major recognition for the pair — Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko — who are among the most influential voices among the volunteers filling vital gaps in logistics and drone expertise for Ukraine's battered military.\n\nBeskrestnov, widely cited among Ukrainians as an expert on drones, runs a Telegram channel with some 156,000 followers, where he publicly analyzes Russian and Ukrainian battle drones and how they've performed.\n\nFedorov named him an advisor in defense technology on Sunday, saying Beskrestnov would focus on helping Ukraine build counter-systems for Russian strike and reconnaissance drones.\n\nIn his statement, Fedorov said that Beskrestnov would also support Ukraine's military in analyzing Russian tech, studying \"logistics, study of enemy solutions, and leveraging this experience to our advantage.\"\n\nSternenko, a political activist who now runs an organization that raises funds for military drones, was appointed as Fedorov's advisor on Thursday.\n\n\"From now on, Serhii will act as my advisor on enhancing the use of UAVs at the frontline. His experience will help us implement our shared vision of improving the effectiveness of units operating unmanned systems,\" Fedorov said.\n\nThe Sternenko Foundation serves as a hub for drone procurement, raising money to buy specialized first-person-view drones for military units that demonstrate they're combat-effective.\n\nAs of Monday, it says it has delivered over 256,000 drones on demand to Ukrainian units.\n\nFedorov, Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister at 35, previously was the country's minister for digital transformation. Since being confirmed to his new role earlier this month, he's pledged to revitalize Ukraine's military, promising to reform its training programs, internal culture, and organizational doctrine.\n\nAppointing Sternenko and Beskrestnov as advisors is a significant change in how Kyiv treats its grassroots movements. These groups work closely with Ukrainian forces, but top authorities have generally been slow to officially recognize or integrate them.\n\nSeveral frontline units previously told Business Insider that they sometimes rely on the Sternenko Foundation, for example, for drones that can effectively cope with Russian electronic warfare. While the Ukrainian military provides its fighters with drones in bulk, these sometimes need further tweaks as the battlefield evolves rapidly.\n\nVolunteer foundations often step in and have become known for their speed, leveraging connections with drone manufacturers and informal logistics networks to deliver priority supplies, vehicles, and modified drones within hours or days.\n\nFedorov said that Sternenko would particularly assist in establishing basic support for drone units, adding that 50 of Ukraine's 400 units account for 70% of its battlefield engagements.\n\n\"The objective is to enable the other 350 units to grow quickly and significantly increase the scale of destroying Russian forces,\" Fedorov said.\n\nBeskrestnov, meanwhile, regularly publicizes news about Russia's Shahed-type drones. He often posts footage from found wreckage to show how the Kremlin has been modifying or upgrading the loitering munitions.\n\nFedorov's team credited the drone analyst for being the \"first to report on the use by Russians of FPV drones equipped with machine vision, as well as the use of jet-powered Shahed drones.\"\n\nThe new defense minister's attempt to reshape Ukraine's military comes as it grapples with a slew of challenges, including heightened fighting intensity on the front lines in recent months and a withdrawal of most US miliary support.\n\nIn his opening speech to Ukraine's parliament, Fedorov said the country was facing a high rate of desertion and draft dodging, and that the military's budget had shrunk since last year.",

    "fullText": "For average wage earners in Russia, it's a big payday. For criminals seeking to escape the harsh conditions and abuse in prison, it's a chance at freedom. For immigrants hoping for a better life, it's a simplified path to citizenship.\n\nAll they have to do is sign a contract to fight in Ukraine.\n\nAs Russia seeks to replenish its forces in nearly four years of war — and avoid an unpopular nationwide mobilization — it's pulling out all the stops to find new troops to send into the battlefield.\n\nSome come from abroad to fight in what has become a bloody war of attrition. After signing a mutual defense treaty with Moscow in 2024, North Korea sent thousands of soldiers to help Russia defend its Kursk region from a Ukrainian incursion.\n\nMen from South Asian countries, including India, Nepal and Bangladesh, complain of being duped into signing up to fight by recruiters promising jobs. Officials in Kenya, South Africa and Iraq say the same has happened to citizens from their countries.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure – 617,000 – in December 2023. It's unclear if those numbers are accurate.\n\nStill hidden are the numbers of military casualties, with Moscow having released limited official figures. The British Defense Ministry said last summer that more than 1 million Russian troops may have been killed or wounded.\n\nIndependent Russian news site Mediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, scoured news reports, social media and government websites and collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed. More than 550 of those were foreigners from over two dozen countries.\n\nUnlike Ukraine, where martial law and nationwide mobilization has been in place since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Putin has resisted ordering a broad call-up.\n\nWhen a limited mobilization of 300,000 men was tried later that year, tens of thousands of people fled abroad. The effort stopped after a few weeks when the target was met, but a Putin decree left the door open for another call-up. It also made all military contracts effectively open-ended and barred soldiers from quitting service or being discharged, unless they reached certain age limits or were incapacitated by injuries.\n\nSince then, Moscow has largely relied on what it describes as voluntary enlistment.\n\nThe flow of voluntary enlistees signing military contracts has remained strong, topping 400,000 last year, Putin said in December. It was not possible to independently verify the claim. Similar numbers were announced in 2024 and 2023.\n\nActivists say these contracts often stipulate a fixed term of service, such as one year, leading some potential enlistees to believe the commitment is temporary. But contracts are automatically extended indefinitely, they say.\n\nThe government offers high pay and extensive benefits to enlistees. Regional authorities offer various enlistment bonuses, sometimes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nIn the Khanty-Mansi region of central Russia, for example, an enlistee would get about $50,000 in various bonuses, according to the local government. That's more than twice the average annual income in the region, where monthly salaries in the first 10 months of 2025 were reported to be just over $1,600.\n\nThere also are tax breaks, debt relief and other perks.\n\nDespite Kremlin claims of relying on voluntary enlistment, media reports and rights groups say conscripts — men aged 18-30 performing fixed-term mandatory military service and exempted from being sent to Ukraine — are often coerced by superiors into signing contracts that send them into battle.\n\nRecruitment also extends to prisoners and those in pretrial detention centers, a practice led early in the war by the late mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin and adopted by the Defense Ministry. Laws now allow recruitment of both convicts and suspects in criminal cases.\n\nForeigners also are recruiting targets, both inside Russia and abroad.\n\nLaws were adopted offering accelerated Russian citizenship for enlistees. Russian media and activists also report that raids in areas where migrants typically live or work lead to them being pressuring into military service, with new citizens sent to enlistment offices to determine if they’re eligible for mandatory service.\n\nIn November, Putin decreed that military service was mandatory for certain foreigners seeking permanent residency.\n\nSome reportedly are lured to Russia by trafficking rings promising jobs, then duping them into signing military contracts. Cuban authorities in 2023 identified and sought to dismantle one such ring operating from Russia.\n\nNepal’s Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud told The Associated Press in 2024 that his country asked Russia to return hundreds of Nepali nationals who were recruited to fight in Ukraine, as well as to repatriate the remains of those killed in the war. Nepal has since barred citizens from traveling to Russia or Ukraine for work, citing recruitment efforts.\n\nAlso in 2024, India’s federal investigation agency said it broke up a network that lured at least 35 of its citizens to Russia under the pretext of employment. The men were trained for combat and deployed to Ukraine against their will, with some \"grievously injured,” the agency said.\n\nWhen Putin hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks in 2024, New Delhi said its nationals who were “misled” into joining the Russian army would be discharged.\n\nIraqi officials say about 5,000 of its citizens have joined the Russian military along with an unspecified number who are fighting alongside Ukrainian forces. Officials in Baghdad cracked down on such recruiting networks, with one man convicted last year of human trafficking and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAn unknown number of Iraqis have been killed or gone missing while fighting in Ukraine. Some families have reported that relatives were lured to Russia under false pretenses and forced to enlist; in other cases, Iraqis have joined voluntarily for the salary and Russian citizenship.\n\nForeigners duped into fighting are especially vulnerable because they don’t speak Russian, have no military experience and are deemed “dispensable, to put it bluntly,” by military commanders, said Anton Gorbatsevich of the activist group Idite Lesom, or “Get Lost,” which helps men desert from the army.\n\nThis month, a Ukrainian agency for the treatment of prisoners of war said over 18,000 foreign nationals had fought or are fighting on the Russian side. Almost 3,400 have been killed, and hundreds of citizens of 40 countries are held in Ukraine as POWs.\n\nIf true, that represents a fraction of the 700,000 troops that Putin said are fighting for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nUsing foreigners is only one way to meet the constant demand, said Artyom Klyga, head of the legal department at the Movement of Conscientious Objectors, noting Russian recruitment efforts appear to be stable. Most of those seeking help from the group, which assists men in avoiding military service, are Russian citizens, he said.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, a Russia researcher at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, said the Kremlin has gotten more “creative” in the last two years with attracting enlistees, including foreigners.\n\nBut recruitment efforts are becoming “extremely expensive” for Russia, which faces a slowing economy, she added.",

    "description": "Russia has admitted for the first time that a Ukrainian missile sank its prized Black Sea flagship, later deleting the statement and returning to the official narrative that the guided-missile cruiser Moskva went down because of a freak accident.",
    "fullText": "Russia has admitted for the first time that a Ukrainian missile sank its prized Black Sea flagship, later deleting the statement and returning to the official narrative that the guided-missile cruiser Moskva went down because of a freak accident.\n\nThe Moskva was one of Russia’s most important warships when it sunk in April 2022, just seven weeks after Moscow launched its unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKyiv was quick to claim it had hit the vessel with its Neptune anti-ship cruise missile, but Russia pushed a different narrative of the incident.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense always insisted the Moskva sank after a fire broke out and caused munitions aboard to explode. The Russian military said at the time that the crew of the warship was evacuated, although it later admitted some were missing.\n\nAccording to an independent Russian news outlet Mediazona, a military court in Moscow last week inadvertently corrected the Kremlin’s official narrative. The court, Mediazona said, issued a statement about the sentencing of a Ukrainian navy commander who ordered strikes against the Moskva and another ship, the Admiral Essen frigate. According to the court, he was sentenced to life in prison in absentia.\n\nThe statement was quickly wiped off the court’s website, but not before Mediazona managed to download it.\n\nThe loss of the Moskva was extremely embarrassing for Russia, marking one of Ukraine’s most significant wins of the war so far.\n\nCNN asked Russian authorities about the apparent backtracking. Irina Zhirnova, the spokesperson for the 2nd Western District Military Court, which would have issued the now-deleted statement, said there would be no comment. The Russian military did not respond to CNN’s request.\n\nMediazona has reported on the circumstances of the Moskva sinking extensively in the past, publishing testimonies from the families of sailors who were killed – and whose deaths were never officially acknowledged by the Russian military.\n\n“On April 13, 2022, a missile strike with two missiles hit the Guards missile cruiser Moskva, causing a fire and smoke filling the ship’s interior,” the court said in the statement, according to Mediazona.\n\n“The explosion, fire, and smoke killed 20 of the cruiser’s crew, 24 suffered injuries of varying severity, and eight were missing, including during the over six-hour battle for the ship’s survival,” the statement said, according to Mediazona, adding that the ship was “not involved” in Russia’s operation in Ukraine.\n\nAsked by CNN for a comment, Dmytro Pletenchuk, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s Naval Forces, said it was difficult for Russia to deny the facts of the sinking, especially since the families of the Moskva’s crew have been speaking out.\n\nThe backtracking on the statement by the court is just the latest propaganda fail by Russian authorities.\n\nIn the early days of the invasion, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti published, and then quickly removed, an editorial prematurely celebrating Russia’s victory in the war. Nearly four years later, Russian forces continue to grind along the front lines achieving incremental territorial gains at an extremely high cost, while Ukraine has managed to retake vast areas that Moscow initially invaded.\n\nThe Russian military and the Kremlin have exercised an extremely tight control over the narrative around Russia’s war on Ukraine – even refusing to call the conflict a “war” and referring to it instead as Russia’s “special military operation.”\n\nNumerous journalists who have reported on the facts of the ground, including documenting massacres committed by Russian soldiers in Bucha and elsewhere, have been jailed for spreading “false information” about the Russian army.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists said in December that at least 27 journalist had been imprisoned on criminal charges related to their reporting since Russia launched the full-scale invasion. The committee said that four have been released, two exiled and one killed. The rest are still in prison.",

    "description": "The Unmanned Systems Forces' commander said his units' average engagement distance against Russian soldiers is less than 1 mile from the contact line.",
    "fullText": "The leader of Ukraine's special drone branch said his operators are striking advancing Russian infantry at extreme close range, providing rare insight into how some of the country's best pilots are fighting.\n\nMaj. Robert \"Madyar\" Brovdi, the commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, wrote in a statement on Sunday that his pilots have, over the last month, been engaging enemy troops at an average strike depth of 1.44 km, or 0.89 miles, from the line of contact.\n\nThat's a roughly 15-minute brisk walk for the average person.\n\n\"This figure fluctuates, but: We are literally working under our feet,\" Madyar wrote.\n\nHis remarks reflect how top Ukrainian commanders in some areas have been prioritizing their limited resources. Using elite strike crews for short-range suppression could also be a sign of heightened pressure on Ukrainian lines.\n\nThe Unmanned Systems Forces is a relatively new elite formation in Ukraine that focuses on providing strike or reconnaissance support with smaller drones. Madyar, a prominent drone unit commander appointed to lead the group in June 2025, said on Sunday that his branch comprises 12 combat crews who are present on 30% of the front line.\n\nRussia relies on ground infantry assaults to gradually take territory in Ukraine, and has been aggressively attempting to advance along some key frontline areas in recent months.\n\nMadyar wrote that his units are assigned to corps commanders, who have been deploying the operators to attack such advancing troops at closer range.\n\n\"Not a single Corps commander, who has many hundreds of crews from their own brigades and subordinate units within their area of responsibility, is ready to release SBS work to proper depth,\" Madyar wrote, referring to the Unmanned Systems Forces as the SBS.\n\nHe added that this was due to Ukrainian commanders wanting to protect their troops in the trenches.\n\nFor Ukrainian soldiers, being sent to hold a trench is one of the war's most high-casualty tasks. They're often outnumbered by waves of attacking Russian troops, and typically need the help of friendly drone pilots to thwart assaults before they can get close.\n\nBut ideally, these drone operators try to spot and engage enemy infantry farther away, roughly 6 to 10 miles from the line of contact, as these troops form up or begin to launch assaults.\n\n\"To systematically reach proper depth, it is necessary to manage to create new crews, at least three times more than the current number,\" Madyar wrote. \"The existing ones, for the most part, will remain in tactical depth.\"\n\nMadyar also said infantry strikes have recently accounted for a larger share of his units' time.\n\nAccording to him, the SBS has a usual goal of targeting infantry in 30% of its strikes, but nearly 40% of its successful attacks in December were against infantry, involving roughly 12,000 Russian soldiers.\n\nStill, the commander wrote that in the SBS' entire history, the majority of its engagements have been against Russian equipment and logistics routes, at ranges of roughly 2.3 miles to 9.2 miles, depending on the type of system targeted.\n\nMadyar's branch has struck over 1,200 \"launch points\" for Russian drone pilots, at an average depth of 2.25 miles, he added.\n\nElite drone units typically make a name for themselves by using small, inexpensive drones to strike priority air defense systems, logistics routes, or command posts deep behind enemy lines.\n\nIndeed, Madyar had posted his statement on Sunday in response to what he said were recent criticisms that his units were focusing too much on strikes against Russian soldiers.\n\nMadyar also wrote that not all SBS crews are equally contributing to these strike statistics.\n\n\"Only six to seven out of 12 SBS units are working at the desired pace; the others are catching up and need more time,\" his statement said.",

Robert \"Madyar\" Brovdi, the commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, wrote in a statement on Sunday that his pilots have, over the last month, been engaging enemy troops at an average strike depth of 1.44 km, or 0.89 miles, from the line of contact.\n\nThat's a roughly 15-minute brisk walk for the average person.\n\n\"This figure fluctuates, but: We are literally working under our feet,\" Madyar wrote.\n\nHis remarks reflect how top Ukrainian commanders in some areas have been prioritizing their limited resources. Using elite strike crews for short-range suppression could also be a sign of heightened pressure on Ukrainian lines.\n\nThe Unmanned Systems Forces is a relatively new elite formation in Ukraine that focuses on providing strike or reconnaissance support with smaller drones. Madyar, a prominent drone unit commander appointed to lead the group in June 2025, said on Sunday that his branch comprises 12 combat crews who are present on 30% of the front line.\n\nRussia relies on ground infantry assaults to gradually take territory in Ukraine, and has been aggressively attempting to advance along some key frontline areas in recent months.\n\nMadyar wrote that his units are assigned to corps commanders, who have been deploying the operators to attack such advancing troops at closer range.\n\n\"Not a single Corps commander, who has many hundreds of crews from their own brigades and subordinate units within their area of responsibility, is ready to release SBS work to proper depth,\" Madyar wrote, referring to the Unmanned Systems Forces as the SBS.\n\nHe added that this was due to Ukrainian commanders wanting to protect their troops in the trenches.\n\nFor Ukrainian soldiers, being sent to hold a trench is one of the war's most high-casualty tasks. They're often outnumbered by waves of attacking Russian troops, and typically need the help of friendly drone pilots to thwart assaults before they can get close.\n\nBut ideally, these drone operators try to spot and engage enemy infantry farther away, roughly 6 to 10 miles from the line of contact, as these troops form up or begin to launch assaults.\n\n\"To systematically reach proper depth, it is necessary to manage to create new crews, at least three times more than the current number,\" Madyar wrote. \"The existing ones, for the most part, will remain in tactical depth.\"\n\nMadyar also said infantry strikes have recently accounted for a larger share of his units' time.\n\nAccording to him, the SBS has a usual goal of targeting infantry in 30% of its strikes, but nearly 40% of its successful attacks in December were against infantry, involving roughly 12,000 Russian soldiers.\n\nStill, the commander wrote that in the SBS' entire history, the majority of its engagements have been against Russian equipment and logistics routes, at ranges of roughly 2.3 miles to 9.2 miles, depending on the type of system targeted.\n\nMadyar's branch has struck over 1,200 \"launch points\" for Russian drone pilots, at an average depth of 2.25 miles, he added.\n\nElite drone units typically make a name for themselves by using small, inexpensive drones to strike priority air defense systems, logistics routes, or command posts deep behind enemy lines.\n\nIndeed, Madyar had posted his statement on Sunday in response to what he said were recent criticisms that his units were focusing too much on strikes against Russian soldiers.\n\nMadyar also wrote that not all SBS crews are equally contributing to these strike statistics.\n\n\"Only six to seven out of 12 SBS units are working at the desired pace; the others are catching up and need more time,\" his statement said.",

    "fullText": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that a U.S. security guarantees document for Ukraine is “100% ready” after two days of talks involving representatives from Ukraine, the U.S. and Russia.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Vilnius during a visit to Lithuania, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is waiting for its partners to set a signing date, after which the document would go to the U.S. Congress and Ukrainian parliament for ratification.\n\nZelenskyy also emphasized Ukraine’s push for European Union membership by 2027, calling it an “economic security guarantee.”\n\nThe Ukrainian leader described the talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, as likely the first trilateral format in “quite a long while” that included not only diplomats but military representatives from all three sides. The talks, which began on Friday and continued Saturday, were the latest aiming to end Russia’s nearly four-year full-scale invasion.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged fundamental differences between Ukrainian and Russian positions, reaffirming territorial issues as a major sticking point.\n\n“Our position regarding our territory — Ukraine’s territorial integrity — must be respected,” he said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin discussed a Ukraine settlement with U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner during marathon talks late Thursday. The Kremlin insisted that to reach a peace deal, Kyiv must withdraw its troops from the areas in the east that Russia illegally annexed but has not fully captured.\n\nZelenskyy said the U.S. is trying to find a compromise, but that “all sides must be ready for compromise.”\n\nNegotiators will return to the UAE on Feb. 1 for the next round of talks, according to a U.S. official. The recent talks covered a broad range of military and economic matters and included the possibility of a ceasefire before a deal, the official said. There was not yet an agreement on a final framework for oversight and operation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russia and is the largest in Europe.",

    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - Russia launched another vast attack on Ukraine's energy system in the small hours of Saturday, rocking Kyiv with explosions throughout the night and leaving ​1.2 million properties without power countrywide.\n\nNearly 6,000 buildings in the capital were left without heating ‌on Saturday morning as temperatures hovered around -10 degrees Celsius (14 F). Many residents' apartments were already freezing cold from disruption to the ‌city's centralised heat distribution system following previous attacks.\n\nMoscow carried out the strikes as trilateral, U.S.-brokered talks between Russia and Ukraine continued into a second day in the UAE, with no sign of compromise on Friday.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said one person was killed in the capital city and four injured, including three being treated ⁠in hospital, while 19 people including ‌a child were wounded in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv.\n\nRussia, which has pummelled Ukraine's power grid since its full-scale invasion in 2022, is conducting its heaviest bombardment campaign ‍on energy facilities this winter, leaving people across Ukraine with only a few hours of power a day and some without heat or water.\n\nOver 800,000 people in the capital and another 400,000 in the northern region of Chernihiv ​were without power after the latest attacks, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said.\n\nUkraine's air force said ‌Russia had unleashed 375 drones and 21 missiles, including two of its rarely deployed Tsirkon ballistic missiles, in its overnight attack.\n\nThe sky over Kyiv was lit up by regular orange flashes as air defences fired on missiles and drones descending on the capital, with loud booms echoing around the city's tall buildings.\n\nTymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, reported strikes in at least four districts. A medical facility was ⁠among the buildings damaged.\n\nBefore Saturday, Kyiv had already endured two ​mass overnight attacks since the New Year that have knocked ​out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings.\n\nEmergency workers were still engaged in restoring services to residents that had been knocked out by those attacks, and Klitschko said ‍many of the buildings ⁠that had lost heating on Saturday had only recently had it restored.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a frequent target 30 km (18 miles) from the Russian border and much closer to eastern battlefronts, Mayor Ihor ⁠Terekhov said 25 drones had hit several districts.\n\nWriting on Telegram, Terekhov said the drones had struck a dormitory for displaced people ‌and two medical facilities including a maternity hospital.",

    "description": "Mykhailo Fedorov, the country's new defense minister, said his troops are already inflicting 35,000 battlefield kills a month. He wants more.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's new defense minister has set a new goal for its forces to kill 50,000 Russian troops a month, a sharp increase from the losses that Kyiv says it's inflicting on the Kremlin now.\n\nIn a meeting with reporters on Tuesday, Mykhailo Fedorov said the new figure would be a core \"strategic objective\" for Ukraine.\n\n\"The objective is to impose costs on Russia that it cannot bear. In this way to force peace through strength,\" Fedorov said.\n\nNotably, he specified only battlefield fatalities.\n\nThe new standard comes as Russia intensified its offensive in some areas of the front lines last year, aiming to take key cities such as Pokrovsk. The nature of its operations — often reliant on continuous high-casualty infantry attacks — has led to political discussion in recent months that the Kremlin may soon reach a point where it will lose more soldiers than it can recruit.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in December that his forces had, for the first time, killed and wounded more Russian soldiers in one month than the Kremlin had called up for the same time period.\n\nFedorov, who was confirmed in his role last week, said on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops are already documenting 35,000 kills every month via video.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte cited another figure while speaking in Brussels on January 16, saying that 20,000 to 25,000 Russian troops were dying every month.\n\nWhile differing significantly, both figures indicate that Russia is fighting the war at a high cost.\n\nRutte said the death rate has become \"unsustainable\" for Russia, and drew comparisons to the Soviet Union's losses during the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, when an estimated 15,000 Soviet troops died every month over nine years.\n\nLikewise, Fedorov expressed hopes that ramping up a focus on lethality will exhaust Russia's war machine.\n\n\"If we reach the figure of 50,000, we will see what happens to the enemy. They treat people as a resource, and problems with that resource are already obvious,\" he said.\n\nRussia does not disclose how many of its troops are wounded or killed during the war. However, international and Ukrainian analyses say the number is likely tracking past 1 million people over nearly four years of war.\n\nThe UK's defense ministry said in early January that the Kremlin may have suffered at least 1.2 million total casualties, which includes both wounded and deceased, since February 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin has relied largely on hefty sign-up bonuses to attract local contract soldiers, though it's also been found to sustain troop levels through other means, such as by recruiting from prisons or hiring foreigners via informal channels.\n\nSome of those strategies may be waning. On Tuesday, the Russian independent media outlet Vertska reported that contract soldier sign-ups were slowing in some areas of the country.\n\nData from an unnamed source in the Moscow mayor's office, it wrote, showed that the capital had seen a roughly 25% annual drop in recruitment in 2025.\n\nIt's unclear how Fedorov intends to specifically target increasing combat kills. He said in his opening remarks to Ukrainian lawmakers last week that he intended to divert more staffing to drone units. Drones are thought to be responsible for roughly 70 to 90% of casualties inflicted during the war.\n\nHis new objective also comes against the backdrop of the US attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. Many of the Kremlin's latest war actions, such as attempts to take Pokrovsk, have been seen in Ukraine as efforts to posture into a position of strength.\n\nAt 32, Fedorov is Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister. He's begun his new appointment with promises of aggressive reform of the military's structure and how it distributes resources to its fighters.\n\nFedorov was previously Ukraine's minister for digital transformation.",

China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far.\n\nThe UN Security Council has been the main international platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution since the end of World War Two.\n\nBut launching the board at a signing ceremony alongside world leaders in Davos, Trump said he did not intend it as a replacement for the UN and expressed his belief that it would help forge an \"everlasting\" peace in the Middle East.\n\nTrump said the board had the chance to be \"one of the most consequential bodies ever created\".\n\n\"We're committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,\" Trump said. \"It's going to be a great plan and this is where the board of peace started.\"\n\nTrump said once the board had been completely formed, \"we can do pretty much whatever we want to do\".\n\n\"But we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,\" he added.\n\nPresident Trump was joined by the leaders and representatives of 19 countries for the Board of Peace signing ceremony, including Argentina, Hungary, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n\nPresident Trump also said Putin had accepted an invitation to join the initiative.\n\nBut the Russian president has not confirmed this and earlier he said his country was still studying the invitation.\n\nPutin said the idea of using Russian assets frozen in the US as a contribution to the board would be discussed at a meeting with representatives of the Trump administration later on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nLive: World leaders sign Trump's Board of Peace papers\n\nTrump to meet Zelensky as US envoy says ending war with Russia down to one issue\n\nPutin invited to join US-led Gaza 'Board of Peace', Trump says\n\nWho is on Trump's 'Board of Peace' overseeing Gaza's reconstruction?\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Breakfast programme from Davos, Cooper said the UK had received an invitation to join the board and strongly supported Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza.\n\n\"That's why we are also clear we want to play our part in phase two of the Gaza peace process,\" Cooper said.\n\nBut she added: \"We won't be one of the signatories today because this is a legal treaty that raises much broader issues.\n\n\"And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that's talking about peace when we've still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"\n\nShe said Putin had shown no willingness \"to come and make that agreement and that's where the pressure needs to be now\".\n\n\"But we will have continuing international discussions including with our allies,\" the foreign secretary said.\n\nDiplomatic relations between the US and the UK are on shakier ground after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European nations if his demand to hand control of Greenland to his country was not met.\n\nBut Trump appears to have backed down, saying the US was exploring a potential deal on Greenland after talks with the Nato security alliance, as he dropped planned tariffs on eight European countries and ruled out using force to take the island.\n\nCooper welcomed the apparent climbdown on Greenland and said the UK and its European allies had put forward \"positive, constructive proposals\" on security in the Arctic.\n\nBut when asked about the Board of Peace, Cooper echoed other UK cabinet ministers who in recent days have been expressing concerns over Putin's potential role in the scheme, given Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe UK has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies and together with France, signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops to the country if a peace deal is made with Russia.\n\nAs talks to end the war in Ukraine continue, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are due to meet in Davos on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump repeated his often-stated belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.\n\nTrump's Board of Peace was originally unveiled by the White House as part of a plan to rebuild Gaza and design its future governance.\n\nBut the leaked text of the board's founding charter goes far beyond that purpose.\n\nThe text says the board would be \"an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict\".\n\nThe leaked document says the Board of Peace's charter will enter into force once three states formally agree to be bound by it, with member states given renewable three-year terms and permanent seats available to those contributing $1bn (£740m), it said.\n\nThe charter declared the body as an international organisation mandated to carry out peace-building functions under international law, with Trump serving as chairman - and separately as the US representative - and holding authority to appoint executive board members and create or dissolve subsidiary bodies.\n\nLast Friday, the White House named seven members of the founding Executive Board, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nMore have now said they will join it, including Pakistan, Egypt and Qatar.\n\nThe Vatican has said the Pope has also received an invitation.",

    "description": "Ukrainian interceptors on the market can typically fly at speeds of up to 200 mph, but they'll need to be faster to catch Russia's newer Gerans.",
    "fullText": "As the Ukraine-Russia drone arms race rages, hobbyists far from the war are pushing the limit for how quickly these small quadcopters can fly.\n\nA father-son duo in South Africa set a new Guinness World Record by reaching a ground speed of 408 mph with their custom, battery-powered remote-controlled quadcopter, the Peregreen V4.\n\nLuke and Mike Bell performed the record-breaking flight on December 11, 2025, the Guinness World Records organization said in a statement in January.\n\nWhile drones built for war are constrained by additional factors, the Bells' achievement expands the possibilities of how these devices might one day perform on the battlefield.\n\nIt also lays bare how accessible new war-relevant technology is becoming for civilians. The Bells documented their design and build process on YouTube, filming themselves using a 3D printer and off-the-shelf parts to create the Peregreen V4.\n\nTheir drone's design features a dome-shaped head and four propellers extending from the lower body — much like many of the interceptor drones available on the Ukrainian market today.\n\nThese drones, developed primarily as a low-cost way of countering Russian Shahed-type loitering munitions, have become a pillar of Ukrainian air defense.\n\nSome of the fastest interceptors available to Ukrainian forces can reach 200 mph, which is also the typical velocity of a bullet train.\n\nUkrainians are trying to push their quadcopters to fly even faster. Flight speed is key for these interceptors because they're designed to chase and crash into Shaheds, and Russia has been continually ramping up the speeds of its attack drones.\n\nThe Geran-2, a Shahed-type drone that Russia launches more commonly, can carry an explosive warhead for hundreds of miles at top speeds of 115 mph. Newer, jet-powered versions of Shaheds are estimated to fly up to 230 mph in some conditions.\n\nA major issue with faster drones is that their components tend to overheat when pushed to the limit — whether it's the propeller motors, wiring, or batteries.\n\nIn their YouTube videos, the Bells repeatedly recorded their drone or its individual parts catching fire during tests.\n\nDrone makers also have to juggle other design factors, such as the drone's aerodynamics and propeller efficiency.\n\nUkrainian war manufacturers face additional constraints: Their drones need to carry an additional payload — often 200 grams to 1 kg of explosives. They must also be maneuverable enough to pivot and catch a flying enemy target, and be mass-produced.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was already producing 1,000 interceptor drones a day.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bells' flight record involved a single drone that flew largely in a straight line.\n\nThe duo's latest certification is the third time they've attained the fastest-drone record. The previous holder of the achievement was Australian drone maker Ben Biggs, who built a drone that reached 389 mph late last year.\n\nBefore Biggs' record, the Bells' earlier quadcopter, the Peregreen V3, had flown at up to roughly 363 mph in the summer of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, the pair set a record of 298 mph with a similar drone design.\n\nGuinness World Records requires aspiring drone record-breakers to fly their device in two opposing directions and then calculate the average speed to account for wind.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - An Uzbek man was handed a life sentence on Wednesday after a military court in Moscow found him guilty of killing top ​Russian general Igor Kirillov and his assistant in a Ukraine-backed bomb attack in ‌2024.\n\nLieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who was chief of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, and his assistant, ‌Ilya Polikarpov, were killed outside an apartment building in Moscow after a bomb hidden in an electric scooter was remotely detonated in December 2024.\n\nUkraine's SBU intelligence service said it was behind the high-profile hit, one of a string of targeted killings it has organised inside Russia ⁠to punish people it deems responsible ‌for Moscow's war in Ukraine. Russia says the killings amount to acts of state terrorism.\n\nUzbek national Akhmadzhon Kurbonov and three accomplices were found ‍guilty of various crimes related to the Kirillov killing, including terrorism and the illegal trafficking of explosives, Russian investigators said on Wednesday.\n\nThe three accomplices were given jail sentences in maximum security correctional prison ​camps ranging from 18 to 25 years, the Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes, ‌said in a statement.\n\nKurbonov, who is now due to spend the rest of his life in a special regime correctional prison camp, pleaded guilty to the charges, while the others did not, Russian media reported. Reuters was not able to contact lawyers for the men.\n\nThe Investigative Committee said Kirillov's murder had been planned in Ukraine.\n\nThe perpetrators had smuggled the ⁠explosives into Russia from Poland, and one of ​the four men, Robert Safaryan, had stored the components ​at his home in Russia, it said.\n\nKurbonov had then assembled the bomb, planted it and remotely detonated it as Kirillov and Polikarpov stepped out of ‍the building.\n\nA string of ⁠senior Russian military figures have been killed since the start of the war in Ukraine nearly four years ago.\n\nThe latest was Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, head ⁠of the Russian General Staff's army operational training directorate, who died after a bomb planted under his car ‌went off last month.\n\nUkraine has not claimed responsibility for Sarvarov's death.",

    "description": "Fedorov said that Ukrainian forces are expecting to field 40,000 interceptor drones in January alone, a significant boost to its arsenal.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine is set to receive 40,000 interceptor drones in January, thanks in part to a reward system that pays firms for every kill scored against a Russian Shahed, the country's defense minister said.\n\nMykhailo Fedorov said on Tuesday that Kyiv had rolled out a program inviting defense companies to test their small interceptor drones in Ukraine, paying them $20,000 for each Shahed drone their product destroyed.\n\n\"At the time, no one believed in it,\" Fedorov said at a press briefing. \"But now, by this month, 40,000 interceptors are expected to be delivered to the military.\"\n\nOften short of munitions and weapons, Ukraine invites defense firms from around the world — though mostly NATO countries — to test their products on the battlefield.\n\nFedorov, who was appointed defense minister last week, said the payment program had focused on the Chernihiv area, which sits between Kyiv and Russia's western border. Long-range attack drones launched from that border must fly over Chernihiv to reach the Ukrainian capital, and the region thus sees some of the heaviest Shahed flight traffic.\n\nInterceptor drones in Ukraine are generally small, first-person-view drones designed to fly at high speed to catch Russia's Gerans, delta-wing explosive-carrying drones closely based on the Iranian Shahed.\n\nThe most common type of Geran that Ukraine faces can cruise at roughly 6,500 feet and fly at up to 115 mph.\n\nBecause Russia can launch hundreds of these at a time, resource-strapped Ukrainians have prioritized keeping the cost of interceptor drones as low as possible. A typical one costs roughly several thousand US dollars.\n\nFedorov said on Tuesday that Ukraine's military had been actively looking into interceptors since at least February 2025. The technology has evolved rapidly over the last year, with Ukrainian firms still experimenting with designs at the start of 2025 and now scaling up manufacturing for mass production.\n\nReceiving 40,000 interceptors a month would mean that Ukraine can deploy more than 1,000 of them a day — an initial production goal set by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn a separate press briefing on Monday, Zelenskyy repeated that his country was now able to produce about 1,000 interceptors per day.\n\n\"But that is not enough,\" he said. \"Because, frankly speaking, our interceptor drones have already outpaced the number of our operators.\"\n\nZelenskyy said that Fedorov and Ukraine's chief commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, have been assigned with recruiting, training, and deploying more troops who can fly interceptor drones.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces fired nearly $100 million worth of air defense missiles battling Russia's latest bombardment, Kyiv revealed on Tuesday, offering insight into the war's growing financial toll.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that the Russian attack, which began Monday night and continued into Tuesday, forced Kyiv to launch around €80 million (roughly $94 million) worth of interceptor missiles.\n\n\"Imagine that — the cost of these missiles,\" Zelenskyy said over WhatsApp in response to a question about interceptor stockpiles.\n\nThe staggering figure covers only the interceptor missiles and does not appear to account for any other munitions expended to defend against the Russian attack, which also included hundreds of drones.\n\nRussia launched 18 ballistic missiles, 15 cruise missiles, and one anti-ship missile overnight, according to data from Ukraine's air force. It said in a statement that 27 were shot down, while five hit their targets.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia has \"significantly increased\" its use of ballistic missiles and has been able to obtain critical technology for the munitions from third-party countries and from industry.\n\n\"Nevertheless, their ability to produce these missiles must be reduced — and that is not happening yet,\" he said in response to another question.\n\nAlthough Ukraine has received some additional air defense systems from Western countries, Zelenskyy said more are still needed, along with additional interceptor missiles to keep pace with Russia's attacks.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged that it has been difficult for Ukraine to obtain the necessary interceptor missiles. He specifically singled out the PAC-3, which has a $3.7 million price tag and is fired from US-made Patriot batteries, as the best chance Kyiv has to defeat Russian ballistic missiles.\n\n\"War is an extremely expensive Russian luxury, and for us it results in severe losses,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussian missiles are not the only worry for Ukraine. Moscow's overnight attack involved 339 drones. Kyiv said its Air Force shot down 315 of them. Two dozen hit their targets.\n\nTo preserve its costly air defense missiles, Ukraine has been increasingly relying on locally made interceptor drones that cost as little as a few thousand dollars to hunt down and destroy Russian drones.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine is producing around 1,000 interceptor drones each day, a goal he set last summer. The challenge now, he said, is that the number of drones has outpaced the number of operators who can control them.\n\n\"Therefore, now we must catch up in terms of the number of interceptor groups — the corresponding mobile groups,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he has tasked senior Ukrainian military leadership with bridging the gap.",

It's a battlefield technology sector where Ukraine is rapidly experimenting and Western militaries are paying close attention.\n\nArk Robotics is one of the companies supplying these systems, making a suite of autonomous robots used by more than 20 Ukrainian brigades.\n\nIts CEO, Achi, told Business Insider that Ukrainian soldiers have demonstrated \"some really crazy ideas I would never imagine in my life that you would do.\" He spoke using a pseudonym as a security precaution.\n\nOne example involved pairing a small Ark ground robot with a larger aerial drone, which carried the robot forward before \"dropping it out of the sky.\"\n\nHe said that when he first saw it, his immediate reaction was: \"What the fuck? Why?\" Then it quickly made sense.\n\n\"The goal is simple: get a tool on the ground fast without putting a person in harm's way.\"\n\nUltimately, he found, \"it works.\"\n\nHe said this use \"wasn't the robot's original design, but give smart, motivated people a tool, and they'll find new ways to use it — and squeeze more out of it.\"\n\nThe \"soldiers keep surprising us,\" Achi said. \"They are very creative.\"\n\nAerial drones are available in significant numbers and are able to cover great distances quickly. Using them to transport ground robots helps overcome some of the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the robots, which have notable advantages once deployed.\n\nSmall ground robots can do things that are sometimes more challenging for aerial drones. They can drive into Russian dugouts or other positions to gather intelligence or deliver explosives. They can also be more precise when firing mounted weapons, and they are easier to conceal near Russian positions than aerial drones, which are noisy and have to hover overhead.\n\nAchi described the tactic as one example of how quickly battlefield technology and tactics are evolving in Ukraine.\n\n\"There is so much innovation happening right now that it's hard to comprehend,\" he said.\n\nOther arms makers have also been surprised at how Ukraine's forces have used their weaponry. Kuldar Väärsi, the founder and CEO of Estonia's Milrem Robotics, which makes ground robots used by Ukraine's forces, previously told BI that Ukrainian soldiers have used them in ways he hadn't expected.\n\n\"The creativity of Ukrainian troops is really admirable,\" he said, adding that the way the company's robots are used in Ukraine has led it to make changes in their design.\n\nCompanies with products deployed in Ukraine are seeking constant feedback from soldiers, often through group chats, video calls, and direct visits to front-line units.\n\nAchi said the challenge for Ark Robotics is keeping pace with new ideas without changing products so rapidly that large-scale production becomes impossible.\n\nArk needs to experiment constantly and stay aware of what's happening on the battlefield, but focusing on the wrong trends would mean sacrificing both mass and quality.\n\n\"This iteration cycle is insane. I've never seen anything like it,\" he said. It can mean making five different changes to a product in a few weeks, all while trying to make sure that you \"lead your whole engineering team the right way.\"\n\nAchi said that even the importance of ground robots surprised him. In 2023, they were a \"random side project,\" he said, but Ark has leaned into the technology.\n\nArk Robotics also develops aerial drones and is making a system called Frontier that it says will enable thousands of aerial drones and ground robots to work together effectively with minimal human involvement.\n\nUkraine's defense industry has boomed since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022, and its Western partners have been closely watching, impressed at how quickly it can develop and make weaponry.\n\nGround robots still make up only a small fraction of Ukraine's drone usage, but it's a growing area, with more companies entering the space and existing ones growing.\n\nAchi said he believes Ukraine is moving toward a future in which robots handle a significant share of front-line logistics. His long-term view is that sending people into vehicles near the front lines will increasingly make little sense.",

    "title": "Ukraine's elite Alpha unit dealt a $4 billion blow to Russian air defenses last year, security forces say",
    "description": "The Security Service of Ukraine said its \"Alpha\" special forces hit Russian air defense and radar systems with long-range strikes.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's elite \"Alpha\" unit destroyed or disabled Russian air defense systems that were worth a total of around $4 billion over the past year, the country's security service said.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Monday that its \"Alpha\" special forces unit conducted long-range strikes on Russian air defense and radar systems. The unit heavily relies on long-range drones in its attacks.\n\nIt said the strikes managed to break open corridors in Russia's multilayered air defenses and created safe passages to allow Ukraine's long-range drones to punch deep behind enemy lines.\n\nThose deep-strike assets struck targets like military bases, warehouses, and airfields, the SBU said. Ukraine has reported a slew of such strikes, which are key in preventing a big Russian force buildup and hindering operations.\n\nThe SBU listed off the types of air defense systems it said Alpha attacks destroyed or damaged: S-300s and S-400s, BUK M-1s and M-2s, Pantsir S-1s and S-2s, and Tor-M1s, M2s, and M3s. These systems range from older, Soviet-era models to some of Russia's most advanced systems.\n\nMany of these systems come with large price tags, though the cost of the losses is often the estimated current cost of replacement. Russia's defense industrial base faces strains from sanctions and other pressures.\n\nThe Ukrainian security service said the Russians also suffered losses of radar reconnaissance and guidance equipment, including radar stations and radars. Examples listed by the SBU included the Nebo-U radar and the Gamma-D.\n\nThe Alpha group is an elite unit that is considered among the best of Ukraine's special forces. It frequently carries out long-range drone attacks on Russian targets, including on aircraft, ammunition depots, and oil operations in Russia.\n\nIn November, the SBU said that its \"Alpha\" special forces had killed more than 1,500 Russian soldiers and destroyed dozens of tanks, armored combat vehicles, multiple rocket launchers, and air defense systems over the previous month.\n\nAir defense systems have been an integral part of this conflict, fundamentally shaping how it has been fought. Russia and Ukraine, at the start of the full-scale war in February 2022, possessed the largest and second-largest air defense arsenals in Europe, respectively, and their proliferation has heavily restricted front-line air operations. Neither side has been able to secure permanent control of the skies.\n\nA lack of air cover hamstrung large-scale breakthrough efforts, blunting the effectiveness of weaponry like tanks and contributing to the war's transformation into a slow, grinding fight, one where drones dominate and further prevent maneuver.\n\nUkraine has reported the destruction of a slew of Russian air defense weapons throughout the war, including advanced S-400s and a host of defenses on the strategic Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed illegally in 2014. Crippling these has been a priority.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has raised alarms in much of Europe and NATO about the lack of ground-based air defenses. Investment in them slowed after the Cold War. The alliance has pledged a huge investment in them, but it's the kind of ramp-up that takes time. Western manufacturers already have big backlogs amid the increased demand.\n\nAir defense is vital for combating not just crewed and uncrewed aircraft, but also missiles, and there is a substantial global demand for proven capabilities. US defense giant Lockheed Martin recently announced a deal with the Pentagon to dramatically boost production of Patriot interceptors.\n\nUkraine has received air defense systems from partner nations over the course of the war, from advanced US-made Patriots to improvised \"FrankenSAMs\" that mix Soviet launchers with Western missiles. Ukraine is building its own air defense systems to reduce dependency on partners.\n\nUkraine says it needs more air defenses and far more interceptors. Russia regularly hammers the country with massive missile and drone barrages targeting both military and civilian infrastructure.\n\nThough Ukraine appears to be inflicting damage, Russia's air defense arsenal is still a threat.\n\nJustin Bronk, an airpower expert at the Royal United Services Institute, warned in a report this month that despite Russia's ground-based integrated air defence systems suffering attrition from Ukraine, Russia still has several hundred batteries of different surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems in service.\n\nFurthermore, he said, they have also become \"significantly more effective\" at shooting down Ukrainian air assets as Russia learns throughout the war.\n\nAnd beyond Ukraine, he warned that Russia's ground-based air defenses remain \"a highly potent threat to NATO air capabilities in a European context.\"",

    "title": "Russia is pushing to build 1,000 of its localized Iranian Shahed drones every day, Ukraine's military chief says",
    "description": "Oleksandr Syrskyi said that Russia is currently producing 404 Shaheds \"of various types\" per day.",
    "fullText": "Russia has plans to more than double production of its Iranian-designed attack drones to 1,000 per day, said Ukrainian Armed Forces' commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi.\n\n\"The enemy plans to significantly increase production to use up to 1,000 drones per day,\" Syrskyi said of these drones.\n\nHe was speaking in an interview published on Sunday by the local media outlet LB.Ua, in which he commented on a wide range of topics, including the effectiveness of Ukraine's deep strikes into Russia and the balance of power in drone warfare.\n\nSyrskyi gave a precise assessment of Russia's current Shahed manufacturing, saying that Moscow can now produce 404 Shahed drones \"of various types\" every day.\n\nThese Russian delta-wing drones are closely modeled after Iran's loitering munitions. Moscow manufactures its own versions, dubbed Gerans, as well as cheaper decoys called Gerberas.\n\nRussia typically deploys a mix of strike drones and decoys when launching long-range attacks into Ukraine, and can send hundreds in a single night.\n\nSyrskyi did not say if Russia's daily Shahed production included Gerberas, nor did he break down exact production figures for each type of Shahed-type drone. The Geran-1 and Geran-2, propeller-driven drones that can fly up to 115 mph, are more common than the faster, jet-powered Geran-3.\n\nLaunching 1,000 Shahed-type drones a day would be a massive surge in Russia's attack capability. Moscow has generally been deploying 5,000 to 6,000 Shaheds a month against Ukraine, and half to four-fifths of these are usually strike variants.\n\nPer an analysis by the Institute for Science and International Security, Russia launched an average of 166 Shahed drones per day in December 2025. However, it's known to sometimes pause or reduce the intensity of its strikes to accumulate a stockpile for later use in a single large wave.\n\nCost is a major advantage for Shaheds. Each is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $70,000, making it cheaper and easier to manufacture than a conventional missile and providing Russia with a way to scale up its strike capability more sustainably.\n\nResource-strapped Ukraine has responded by seeking cheaper complements for its air defense network, including the growing use of small interceptor drones.\n\nStill, Russia's monthly use of Shahed-type drones has remained largely stagnant for the last six months. Moscow has, meanwhile, been experimenting with the loitering munitions, such as equipping them with air-to-air missiles or rear-facing cameras.\n\nSyrskyi's public assessment also comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned on Friday that his country was running low on ammunition for Western-supplied air defense systems.\n\nZelenskyy said that Ukraine had just secured a replenished stock of those munitions, but before that, it was fielding \"several systems without missiles.\"\n\n\"Today I can say this openly, because today, I have those missiles,\" he said.\n\nAs for other drones used in the war, Syrskyi said that Russia and Ukraine were now evenly matched in production quantity. Both Kyiv and Moscow have sporadically claimed the advantage on this front in recent years.\n\n\"The question is in quality. In conventional drones, quality is on our side. In fiber optics, unfortunately, we are only catching up with the enemy,\" Syrskyi said.",

The strikes aim to weaken Ukrainians’ will to resist in a strategy that Kyiv officials call “weaponizing winter.”\n\nRussia targeted energy infrastructure in Odesa region overnight on Sunday, according to Ukraine’s Emergency Service. A fire broke out and was promptly extinguished.\n\nAt least six people were wounded in the Dnipropetrovsk region from Russian attacks, the emergency service said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that repairing the country’s energy system remains challenging, “but we are doing everything we can to restore everything as quickly as possible.”\n\nHe said that two people were killed in overnight attacks across the country that struck Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and Odesa.\n\nIn total, more than 1,300 attack drones, 1,050 guided aerial bombs and 29 missiles of various types were used by Russia to strike Ukraine this week, Zelenskyy said.\n\n“If Russia deliberately delays the diplomatic process, the world’s response should be decisive: more help for Ukraine and more pressure on the aggressor,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe spoke the day after a Ukrainian delegation arrived in the United States for talks on a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the war.\n\nOn Friday, Zelenskyy said that the delegation would try to finalize with U.S. officials documents for a proposed peace settlement that relate to postwar security guarantees and economic recovery.\n\nIf American officials approve the proposals, the U.S. and Ukraine could sign the documents next week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Zelenskyy said at a Kyiv news conference with Czech President Petr Pavel. Trump plans to be in Davos, according to organizers.\n\nRussia would still need to be consulted on the proposals.\n\nSeparately, in Russia’s Caucasus mountains, two children and an adult were wounded overnight as debris from a Ukrainian drone fell on a five-story residential building in North Ossetia, according to the regional governor.\n\nSeventy people had to be evacuated from the building, in the town of Beslan, and there was damage to its roof and windows, Gov. Sergei Menyaylo said in a Telegram post on Sunday morning.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said that its forces shot down or suppressed 63 Ukrainian drones overnight over Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. One person was hospitalized in Russia’s Krasnodar region east of Crimea following a drone strike, local authorities said.\n\nUkrainian crews have started repair works on the backup power line connecting the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to the power grid, under a ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based U.N. organization said in an X post on Sunday.\n\nThe fate of the plant, occupied by Russia and the largest in Europe, is a central issue in ongoing U.S.-brokered peace talks.\n\n“Crucial repair works on the essential back up Ferosplavna-1 330 kV power line connecting Ukraine’s ZNPP to the grid have begun under another IAEA-brokered ceasefire,” the agency said in the post.\n\nThe 330-kilovolt power line, which was damaged and disconnected because of fighting, is crucial to supplying the plant with electricity.",
