    "fullText": "Move marks big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as safeguard against Russian attacks\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy has offered to drop Ukraine’s aspirations to join the Nato military alliance, as he held five hours of talks with US envoys in Berlin on Sunday to end the war with Russia.\n\nDonald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said “a lot of progress was made” as he and the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met Zelenskyy in the latest push to end Europe’s bloodiest conflict since the second world war – though full details were not divulged.\n\nDmytro Lytvyn, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said Zelenskyy would comment further when the talks conclude on Monday. He added that officials are now considering the draft documents.\n\nBefore the talks, Zelenskyy had offered to drop Ukraine’s goal to join Nato in exchange for western security guarantees.\n\nThe move marks a big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia’s war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow.\n\n“Representatives held in-depth discussions regarding the 20-point plan for peace, economic agendas, and more. A lot of progress was made,” Witkoff wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe talks were hosted by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who a source said had made brief remarks before leaving the two sides to negotiate. Other European leaders are also due in Germany for talks on Monday.\n\nZelenskyy described the concession on Nato as a compromise.\n\n“From the very beginning, Ukraine’s desire was to join Nato: these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,” he said – adding that legally binding security guarantees from the US, Europe and other countries such as Canada and Japan could “prevent another Russian invasion”.\n\nVladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its Nato ambitions and withdraw troops from approximately 10% of Donbas that Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country, and that no Nato troops can be stationed there.\n\nRussian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a “written” pledge by leading western powers not to enlarge the US-led Nato alliance eastwards – shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics.\n\nZelenskyy had earlier called for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again.\n\nUnder pressure from Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow’s demands, Zelenskyy accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities, as well as Ukraine’s power and water supplies.\n\nSending Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress nearly four years after Russia’s 2022 invasion.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine, Europe and the US are looking at a 20-point plan, and that at the end of this there is a ceasefire. He said Kyiv has had no direct talks with Moscow.\n\nA ceasefire along the current frontlines would be a fair option, he added.\n\nBritain, France and Germany have been working to refine the US proposals, which in a draft disclosed last month called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its Nato ambitions and accept limits on its armed forces.\n\nEuropean allies have described this as a “critical moment” that could shape Ukraine’s future, and sought to shore up Kyiv’s finances by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget.",

    "fullText": "A 1,000-strong \"dark fleet\" of rogue oil tankers skirting sanctions has emerged as a new target for the U.S. and Ukraine, a senior maritime intelligence analyst claims.\n\nMichelle Wiese Bockmann warned the aging fleet poses geopolitical risks and threats of $1 billion oil spills, with the recent U.S. seizures in Venezuela and Ukrainian drone strikes in the Black Sea marking a turning point for both nations in their efforts.\n\n\"There are about 1,000 vessels worldwide that are trading sanctioned crude tankers containing sanctioned Iranian, Venezuelan and Russian oil,\" Bockmann told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"These vessels are a lifeline for these regimes, because they’re used for shipping oil to fund the war in Ukraine, and also give money to the illicit Maduro regime,\" she added.\n\nIran Backs Maduro To Keep Latin America Foothold As Trump Increases Pressure On Venezuela\n\n\"This is a brand-new problem for the U.S., and now Ukraine has signaled they are going to target these vessels the same way,\" she said. \"There is a new strategy to deal with this dark fleet, which is the lifeline of sanctioned oil revenues, and now under attack by the U.S. and Ukraine. The strategy is all to counter what we call gray-zone aggression.\"\n\nUs Escalation With Maduro Halts Deportation Flights To Venezuela\n\nRecent Ukrainian naval drone strikes have disabled several tankers in the Black Sea, including the Dashan, part of Russia’s so-called shadow fleet that Ukraine says helps Moscow export oil in defiance of sanctions, according to Reuters.\n\n\"It is dangerous and could be interpreted as a form of gray-zone aggression in order to continue to keep oil revenue flowing,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"This is all a billion-dollar oil spill catastrophe waiting to happen,\" she added, pointing to the environmental and navigational risks posed by poorly maintained, uninsured ships.\n\nVenezuela Mobilizes Troops, Weapons In Response To Us Warship Buildup In Caribbean\n\nShe said a subset of \"about 350 to 400 vessels at any one time are not only sanctioned but falsely flying flags, which is dangerous,\" because false registration leaves vessels stateless and uninsured, putting crews at risk.\n\n\"This is a huge issue for maritime safety, it’s a menace to the environment, and it entails crew welfare,\" Bockmann said.\n\nThese vessels, she said, are typically \"elderly\" and used solely for sanctioned oil trades. Many also \"manipulate AIS\" to show they are in one place when they are actually elsewhere.\n\nTrump Sends World's Most Powerful Warship To Latin America — Historic Echoes Of Regime Change\n\n\"They use false flagging, but also spoofing and manipulating its AIS to show it's in one place when it's not. These vessels have also gone to fraudulent registries that don't exist, which means they have no insurance,\" she said. \"Their certificates of seaworthiness are invalid, and they have relied on international maritime conventions to have what's called the ‘right of innocent passage’ so they can't get intercepted.\"\n\nBockmann said U.S. forces have used legal tools including Article 110 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which allows boarding of stateless vessels, to stop these ships.\n\n\"It's my belief that they used Article 110, and they got on board that vessel, and they were absolutely entitled to remove that vessel from global trade,\" she said.\n\nVenezuela Accuses Us Of 'Piracy' After Seizing Massive Oil Tanker\n\nIn the Caribbean, U.S. forces recently seized the tanker Skipper, sanctioned in 2022 and found to be masking its location, under a federal warrant as part of a broader campaign to disrupt illicit oil shipping.\n\n\"The recent Venezuelan tanker was carrying 1.8 million barrels of oil uninsured, so that's a billion-dollar maritime disaster waiting to happen,\" Bockmann said.\n\nAs reported by Fox News Digital, Dec. 12 saw Attorney General Pam Bondi frame the U.S. seizure of a Venezuelan crude tanker as a sanctions-enforcement action rooted in a federal court warrant.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Black Sea, Ukraine targeted multiple alleged \"shadow fleet\" tankers with sea drones, according to Reuters.\n\n\"The three tankers that have been targeted by Ukraine are all in ballast, which means that they weren't carrying oil,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"That was carefully chosen, and they were also falsely flagged, just like in the recent case of the three tankers attacked in Ukraine. That flag was Gambia. In the U.S. case of Skipper, the flag was Guyana,\" Bockmann said.\n\nFox News Digital's Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "Ukraine's drone schools are preparing soldiers to take on Russia and working to keep pace with an ever-changing fight.",
    "fullText": "The Ukrainian drone schools training operators for war are having to rewrite their lessons as fast as every other week to get students ready for an ever-changing battlefield.\n\nWithin the drone battle, a critically important aspect of this war, tech and tactics are shifting rapidly. Three drone schools told Business Insider that it's imperative they keep their lessons up to date because it's life or death on the battlefield.\n\nTo maintain relevance and the tactical edge, the instructors are visiting the front regularly, keeping in touch with former students, and testing out new technology to shape their curriculum.\n\nTetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, told Business Insider that changes sometimes take place every two weeks.\n\nAt the front, the evolution of technology is \"moving forward at a very fast pace.\" It means that \"also we have to be very fast in our adaptability.\"\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, told BI that \"we continuously make changes to our training programs.\"\n\nFor the most part, he said, no two lectures on the same subject are exactly the same; something is always changing. Over 16,000 students have trained at the school. Their comments and experiences are reflected in the training program curriculum, Slediuk said. Instructors also visit the front lines, and service members come to the school, where they deliver insight into the latest in warfighting.\n\nThere are also group chats with soldiers, Tetyana said. It's two-way communication, with soldiers sharing front-line feedback and instructors providing guidance and advice.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that it is absolutely vital that schools teach what is informed by and needed for the field.\n\n\"We do not teach things that will not be necessary in combat,\" he said. \"We constantly update our instructors' knowledge,\" occasionally with visits to the front to \"see firsthand what has changed, what remains relevant, and what can be discarded.\"\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, told Business Insider that all students are in group chats with their instructors, and that connection is preserved after the training is complete. \"Cadets go to the front line, type questions in those chats, or provide information about new enemy tactics.\"\n\nNew information is added to the courses, with some topics updated every three months, he said.\n\nDrone strikes are responsible for most front-line hits and casualties, with both sides using them in lieu of traditional weaponry.\n\nThe result is constant modifications to how they are used and their tactics, as well as the drones themselves, with new types frequently entering the battlefield.\n\nLuke Pollard, the UK's armed forces minister, said this year that Western militaries risk becoming outdated. He said drone warfare is evolving so fast that \"we have to fundamentally challenge our assumptions.\"\n\nHe said that drone technology in Ukraine \"iterates every two to three weeks on the front line,\" while NATO militaries \"build and procure really expensive high-end bits of kit. And it will take you five, 10 years: five years to run a procurement challenge, another 10 years to build it.\" At that rate, the system may already be obsolete by the time it's ready for war.\n\nDefense companies watching Ukraine can see the speed of change, too, and are moving quickly to make changes. Matt McCrann, CEO of the US arm of Droneshield, a company making counter-drone systems for the US and Europe, recently told Business Insider that weapon development cycles are shifting from months and years to weeks.\n\nCompanies are regularly engaging in approaches similar to the drone schools — chats with soldiers and even front-line visits — to keep their understanding of warfighting demands up to date. Some companies have previously told BI that the ways Ukrainians are using tech have come as a surprise, so that communication and engagement are critical.\n\nGediminas Guoba, the CEO of Lithuanian company Granta Autonomy, which has drones in Ukraine, told Business Insider over the summer that he visits the battlefield himself \"just to understand how it really works\" and see what changes need to be made to its products to keep them relevant.\n\nAnd it's beneficial for soldiers too, sparking faster iteration. Ukrainian drone operators have told Business Insider that they keep in touch with companies making their drones to give them feedback on how they can be improved, as well as to get things like replacement parts.\n\nFrom the companies making drones to the troops using them to the schools training operators, everyone is rushing to maintain the edge, but the schools are not simply fighting to stay on top of changes. Targeted by Russian attacks and often seeking donations to help fund the training, they're fighting for survival as well.",

    "description": "The European Union on Friday indefinitely froze Russia’s assets in Europe to ensure that Hungary and Slovakia, both with Moscow-friendly governments, can’t prevent the billions of euros from being used to support Ukraine.  Using a special procedure meant for economic emergencies, the EU blocked the assets until Russia gives up its war on Ukraine and compensates its neighbor for the heavy damage that it has inflicted for almost four years.",
    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Friday indefinitely froze Russia’s assets in Europe to ensure that Hungary and Slovakia, both with Moscow-friendly governments, can’t prevent the billions of euros from being used to support Ukraine.\n\nUsing a special procedure meant for economic emergencies, the EU blocked the assets until Russia gives up its war on Ukraine and compensates its neighbor for the heavy damage that it has inflicted for almost four years.\n\nEU Council President António Costa said European leaders had committed in October “to keep Russian assets immobilized until Russia ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates for the damage caused. Today we delivered on that commitment.”\n\nIt’s a key step that will allow EU leaders to work out at a summit next week how to use the tens of billions of euros in Russian Central Bank assets to underwrite a huge loan to help Ukraine meet its financial and military needs over the next two years.\n\n“Next step: securing Ukraine’s financial needs for 2026–27,” added Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit.\n\nThe move also prevents the assets, estimated to total around 210 billion euros ($247 billion), from being used in any negotiations to end the war without European approval.\n\nA 28-point plan drafted by U.S. and Russian envoys stipulated that the EU would release the frozen assets for use by Ukraine, Russia and the United States. That plan, which surfaced last month, was rejected by Ukraine and its backers in Europe.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X that the EU decision means that “no one will decide in place of the Europeans the use of these funds.”\n\nThe vast majority of the funds — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in Euroclear, a Belgian financial clearing house.\n\nThe money was frozen under sanctions that the EU imposed on Russia over the war it launched on Feb. 24, 2022, but these sanctions must be renewed every six months with the approval of all 27 member countries.\n\nHungary and Slovakia oppose providing more support to Ukraine, but Friday’s decision prevents them from blocking the sanctions rollover and make it easier to use the assets.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe – said on social media that it means that “the rule of law in the European Union comes to an end, and Europe’s leaders are placing themselves above the rules.”\n\n“The European Commission is systematically raping European law. It is doing this in order to continue the war in Ukraine, a war that clearly isn’t winnable,” he wrote. He said that Hungary “will do everything in its power to restore a lawful order.”\n\nIn a letter to Costa, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said that he would refuse to back any move that “would include covering Ukraine’s military expenses for the coming years.”\n\nHe warned “that the use of frozen Russian assets could directly jeopardize U.S. peace efforts, which directly count on the use of these resources for the reconstruction of Ukraine.”\n\nBut the commission argues that the war has imposed heavy costs by hiking energy prices and stunting economic growth in the EU, which has already provided nearly 200 billion euros ($235 billion) in support to Ukraine.\n\nBelgium, where Euroclear is based, is opposed to the “reparations loan” plan. It says that the plan “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks,” and has called on other EU countries to share the risk.\n\nRussia’s Central Bank, meanwhile, said on Friday that it has filed a lawsuit in Moscow against Euroclear for damages it says were caused when Moscow was barred from managing the assets. Euroclear declined to comment.\n\nThe Belgian clearing house has around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) in Russia and it’s unclear what would happen to that money if the legal challenge or others like it succeed.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Central Bank also described wider EU plans to use Russian assets to aid Ukraine as “illegal, contrary to international law,” arguing that they violated “the principles of sovereign immunity of assets.”\n\nBut EU Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis brushed off the suit, saying that the decision is “legally robust,” and that he expects Russia “to continue to launch speculative legal proceedings to prevent the EU from upholding international law.”\n\nChris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. Consultancy, said that the timing of the court action is “clearly linked” to the EU’s intention to use the frozen assets.\n\n“The Russian Central Bank is making clear that it will respond with legal actions against all countries involved in the decision to take the Russian money,” he said.\n\nFriday's EU decision came hours after Germany summoned the Russian ambassador in Berlin following allegations of sabotage, disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks and interference in its elections.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A senior Kremlin official said Friday that Russian police and National Guard will stay on in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas and oversee the industry-rich region, even if a peace settlement ends Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\n\nThe remarks by Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov underscore Moscow's ambition to maintain its presence in Donbas post-war. Ukraine is likely to reject such a stance as U.S.-led negotiations drag on.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian units have recaptured several settlements and neighborhoods near the city of Kupiansk in the northeastern Kharkiv region, following a monthslong operation aimed at reversing Russian advances there.\n\nKupiansk has in recent months been one of the most closely contested sectors of the around 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, and the claimed Ukrainian progress of around 40 sq. km. (15 sq. miles) would be a setback for Russia.\n\nLess than two months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Ukrainian troops in Kupiansk were surrounded and offered to negotiate their surrender. He said a media visit to the area would prove it. Putin has sought to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of strength in the war.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s office said he would host Zelenskyy on Monday for talks as peace efforts gain momentum and European leaders seek to steer negotiations. Afterward, numerous European heads of state and government, as well as the leaders of the European Union and NATO, will join the meeting, a statement said.\n\nMoscow will give its blessing to a ceasefire only after Ukraine’s forces have withdrawn from the front line, Ushakov also said in comments published Friday in Russian business daily Kommersant.\n\nHe told Kommersant “it’s entirely possible that there won’t be any troops (in the Donbas), either Russian or Ukrainian” in a postwar scenario. But he said that “there will be the National Guard, our police, everything necessary to maintain order and organize life.”\n\nFor months, American negotiators have tried to navigate the demands of each side as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for a swift end to Russia’s war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into a major obstacle over who keeps Ukrainian territory that Russian forces have occupied so far.\n\nSince Moscow’s 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea and the seizure of territory in the east by Russia-backed separatists later that year, as well as land taken after the full-blown invasion was launched on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia has captured about 20% of its neighbor.\n\nUkraine says its constitution doesn’t allow it to surrender land. Russia, which illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions illegally in 2022, says the same. Ushakov said that “no matter what the outcome (of peace talks), this territory (the Donbas) is Russian Federation territory.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump compared the negotiations to a very complex real estate deal. He said that he wants to see more progress in talks before sending envoys to possible meetings with European leaders over the weekend.\n\nIn October, Trump said the Donbas region will have to be \"cut up\" to end the war.\n\nIn recent months, Russia’s army has made a determined push to gain control of all parts of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, which together make up the valuable Donbas region.\n\nIts slow slog across the Ukrainian countryside, using its significant advantage in troop numbers in a corrosive war of attrition, has been costly in terms of casualties and losses of armor. Although outnumbered, Ukrainian defenders have held firm in many areas and counterattacked in others.\n\nUkrainian forces said Friday that they had advanced around Kupiansk. They gradually cut off Russian supply routes into the city, starting on Sept. 22, and regained control of the villages of Kindrashivka and Radkivka, as well as several northern districts of the city, according to a statement by Ukrainian National Guard’s Khartia Corps posted on Facebook.\n\nFighting is ongoing in central Kupiansk, where more than 200 Russian soldiers are encircled, the statement said.\n\nZelenskyy posted a video of himself standing on the road into Kupiansk on Friday. Explosions could be heard in the background as he spoke.\n\n“Today, it is critically important to achieve results on the battlefield so that Ukraine can achieve results in diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said in the video, praising his troops on Ukraine’s Ground Forces Day.\n\nRussian officials made no immediate comment, and the Ukrainians statements couldn't be independently verified.\n\nUkraine also has developed its long-range strike capabilities using domestically produced weapons to disrupt Russia's war machine.\n\nIts Special Operations Forces, or SSO, said Friday that an operation in the Caspian Sea struck two Russian vessels carrying military equipment and arms.\n\nThe ships named Kompozitor Rakhmaninov and Askar-Saridzha are under U.S. sanctions for transporting arms between Russia and Iran, the SSO said in a statement on social media. It didn't say what weapons it used in its attack.\n\nA Ukrainian drone attack wounded seven people, including a child, in the Russian city of Tver, acting Gov. Vitaly Korolev said Friday. Falling drone debris struck an apartment building in the city, which lies northwest of Moscow, Korolev said.\n\nRussia’s air defenses destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia’s Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian drones struck a residential area of Pavlohrad, in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding four others, the head of the local military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko, wrote on the Telegram messaging channel on Friday.\n\nUkraine’s southern Odesa region came under a large-scale drone attack overnight, according to regional chief Oleh Kiper. The attack damaged energy infrastructure, he said. More than 90,000 people were without electricity on Friday morning, Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said.\n\nUkraine’s air force said that Russia launched 80 drones across the country during the night.\n\nLitvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.

    "fullText": "Ukraine would join the European Union as early as January 2027 under the latest US plan to end the war with Russia, a senior source familiar with the matter told AFP on Friday.\n\nThe complicated EU accession process usually takes years and requires a unanimous vote from all 27 members of the bloc, and some countries, most notably Hungary, have consistently voiced opposition to Ukraine joining.\n\nThe idea of a speedy accession is included in the latest version of a US-led plan to end the war, which would also see Ukraine cede land to Russia, and has triggered a diplomatic frenzy across Europe in recent weeks.\n\n\"It's stated there but it's a matter for negotiation, and the Americans support it,\" the senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, referring to the US plan.\n\nWashington has the leverage needed to convince leaders opposed to Ukraine's membership to change their stance, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists, including AFP, on Thursday.\n\n\"The United States can take steps to unblock our path to the European Union,\" he said, adding that \"the US president has various levers of influence and that this will have an effect on those who are currently blocking Ukraine.\"\n\nKyiv has long strived for EU membership and has been implementing reforms since a pro-European 2014 revolution but has struggled to eradicate endemic corruption -- a core prerequisite for joining the bloc.\n\nAfter completing a diplomatic tour across Europe last week, Zelensky was due in Berlin on Monday for more talks on the plan, full details of which have not been released.\n\nZelensky will discuss \"the status of peace negotiations in Ukraine\" with \"numerous European heads of state and government, as well as the leaders of the EU and NATO,\" Berlin said.\n\nMoscow on Friday indicated it was suspicious about the efforts to amend the US plan, which it has largely been supportive of and heeded to most of its core demands.\n\n\"We have an impression that this version, which is being put forward for discussion, will be worsened,\" Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told the Kommersant business daily.\n\n\"It'll be a long process,\" he added, saying that Moscow had not seen an updated version of the plan since discussions between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Moscow last week.\n\nZelensky said Thursday that Washington wants only Ukraine, not Russia, to withdraw its troops from parts of the eastern Donetsk region, where a demilitarised \"free economic zone\" would be installed as a buffer between the two armies.\n\nRussia, which has the numerical advantage in manpower and weapons, has been grinding forward on the battlefield for months, notching up its quickest advance for a year in November.\n\nHowever on Friday, Ukraine claimed to have retaken two settlements near Kupiansk -- a strategically important city and a key railway hub in the northeast of the country.\n\nZelensky visited the troops near Kupiansk to congratulate them -- and recorded a video of himself on a road at the entrance to the southwest of the city.\n\nA Russian air strike damaged a Turkish-owned cargo vessel in Ukraine's Black Sea region of Odesa, Kyiv and the operator said Friday, triggering fresh calls from Ankara to halt strikes on port infrastructure.\n\nTurkey earlier warned of a \"worrying escalation\" in the Black Sea after Ukraine claimed naval drone attacks on Russia-linked tankers in the area.",

    "description": "Ukrainian special operators described to Business Insider how they came under Russian fire driving buggies near the front lines.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's elite special operators rely on light buggies to swiftly move along the front lines, banking on their speed and maneuverability to execute high-stakes missions.\n\nThese run-and-gun vehicles don't come with much in the way of external protection, leaving them exposed and vulnerable to Russian drone strikes, but that's the tradeoff for flexibility in combat.\n\nTwo soldiers in Ukraine's 4th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit modeled after its US Army counterparts, talked to Business Insider about how they found themselves under Russian drone fire near the front lines while riding in the buggies.\n\nBoth attacks, which were carried out in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region in recent months, left soldiers injured, the two special operators said. They could only be identified by their call signs for security reasons.\n\nIn September, Khyzhak and two other operators were driving back to base from a mission when a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone appeared behind their buggy and started chasing the vehicle.\n\nKhyzhak said that his driver skillfully maneuvered away from the Russian drone at the last second, which detonated a few feet away on the side of the road. The Ukrainians, having narrowly survived, jumped out of the buggy. One of the operators landed awkwardly and broke his leg.\n\nThe 4th @SOF_UKR Regiment Rangers skillfully maneuver away from an enemy FPV while returning from the frontline to the base. Video from the ranger's action camera of the 2nd Battalion, the Northern-Slobozhanskyi direction. Ukrainian SOF: Always Beyond! pic.twitter.com/i7tN5PQsSZ\n\nTwo months earlier, in July, Drago and several other operators were out in a buggy when they were attacked by a massive swarm of Russian FPV drones — so many, in fact, that he described how their tiny propellers made the whole sky sound \"noisy.\"\n\nDrago said his buggy was struck and shrapnel from the explosion injured his left hand and pelvis. Then, another Ukrainian buggy that went to help came under drone fire. Multiple operators from the 4th Ranger Regiment found themselves caught in the large attack.\n\nKhyzhak speculated that the Russian drone pilots may be intentionally targeting the Ukrainian buggies because these vehicles are known to carry elite troops, forces that tend to stir up trouble behind enemy lines.\n\nIn his case, the Russian drone didn't react to any other vehicles in the vicinity, he said. However, Drago said that when he was struck, the concentration of Russian drones was so high that pilots attacked anything they could, including ATVs and armored personnel carriers.\n\nAlthough several buggies were caught in the attack, Drago said that it's hard to say whether they were priority targets.\n\nIt's unclear to what extent the targeting of buggies may reflect a broader trend. The Russian defense ministry and its embassy in the US did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe buggy is a four-wheel car with virtually no external protection. It is one of the lightweight vehicles used in the conflict for infantry assaults, rapid movement, and other specialized missions, alongside quad bikes, motorcycles, and even electric scooters.\n\nThese buggies can also run logistics missions — hauling ammunition to the front or evacuating wounded troops. Ukraine's defense industry has signaled it intends to mass-produce them.\n\nThe US Army is notably interested in something very similar, the Infantry Squad Vehicle, a lightweight buggy-style combat asset that comes as the service and soldiers look to prioritize speed and flexibility over cumbersome heavy armor.\n\nUnlike armored vehicles, which have hardened exteriors, the buggies used in Ukraine look more like militarized golf carts. However, their main advantages are speed, maneuverability, and off-road capabilities that allow access to areas other vehicles can't reach and a shot at dodging drones, though these can be tough to evade.\n\nThese characteristics are particularly useful for special operators, who try to keep a low profile during their missions.\n\nKhyzhak, who joined Ukraine's special operators forces nearly two years ago and commands a small unit, said that he faced the threat of Russian drones earlier in the war while riding in US-made High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (Humvees) or Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles.\n\nThe September near-miss, though, was the first time he experienced a Russian drone attack while riding in a buggy.\n\nUkrainian officials have said that attack drones are destroying most battlefield targets now, making large mechanized assaults with armored vehicles far harder for both sides.\n\nThe increasing threat of drones has pushed Ukraine and Russia to acquire and field smaller, lighter, and faster vehicles as alternatives to more traditional — often slower, less flexible, and more easily spotted — systems, such as tanks and heavy armor.\n\nAt least 14,000 tanks and armored vehicles have been destroyed in this conflict, according to the open-source intelligence platform Oryx, which tracks equipment losses on both sides. Many systems have been taken out by drones.\n\nThe expanded use of light vehicles for combat and logistics missions underscores how Ukraine and Russia are adapting to the threat of drones, which dominate the battlefield all along the front line.",

    "description": "Russia saw a surge in consumer spending after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, even as sweeping sanctions hit the economy.",
    "fullText": "After years of wartime splurging, Russian shoppers are tightening their grip on their wallets — a shift that hints at growing stress in the country's economy.\n\nGrowth in consumer spending has weakened across most regions, the Central Bank of Russia said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nIn October and November, demand softened even as unemployment remained near historic lows and inflation expectations ticked higher.\n\n\"According to retailers across the country, an increasing share of products are being purchased during promotions, sales, and discounts. Household behavior has become more frugal,\" according to the central bank report.\n\nRetailers in many regions report weakening demand for big-ticket and nonessential goods, marking a clear cooling after the post-2022 consumer boom.\n\n\"More subdued consumption may indicate a gradual reduction in labor market overheating and more moderate expectations for future income dynamics,\" wrote Russia's central bank.\n\nIt's a notable shift for an economy that witnessed a boom in consumer spending after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, even amid sweeping sanctions against Moscow.\n\nThat boom was fueled by surging defense spending and intense competition for scarce workers. Wages jumped, and many households went on spending sprees.\n\nNow, that momentum appears to be fading.\n\nWage growth has slowed, and firms across multiple regions report reduced manpower demand and less urgency to hire, reflecting a cooling labor market, according to the central bank report.\n\nMany firms told the central bank they expect even more modest wage increases in 2026, suggesting that households may be bracing for leaner times.\n\nThe central bank's latest report arrives as Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year, and the limits of wartime economic stimulus become more apparent.\n\nOil and gas revenues — the backbone of Russia's budget — dropped 34% year-over-year in November.\n\nEven before this, analysts had warned that Russia's economy was being sustained largely by defense spending, subsidies, and emergency policy interventions.\n\nTop officials had sounded alarms. In December 2023, Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's central bank governor, warned that the economy was at risk of overheating.\n\nLast June, the head of Russia's largest bank said the economy was \"definitely and strongly overheated.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a deepening demographic crisis and ongoing competition for labor between the military and industry continue to weigh on Russia's growth prospects, both now and in the years ahead.",

    "description": "Drone schools in Ukraine say they've realized what traits tend to make people the best pilots for the fight against Russia.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's drone schools say it's clear: young, tech-savvy people with a gaming background make the best drone pilots.\n\nAcross the country, drone schools are training new operators for what has become one of the most important roles in Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion — flying the drones that scout Russian positions, find targets, and blow up tanks and troops.\n\nThree leaders working at two schools told Business Insider that younger students with gaming or tech experience tend to consistently pick up skills the fastest. These students often are already comfortable with controllers, joysticks, and staring at a screen for a long time.\n\nThe instructor comments offer insight into what kind of person makes the best pilot, useful as Ukraine continues to fight for its survival and Western militaries study the war, investing more heavily in drone programs for a potential future fight.\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, said younger people and gamers, \"are really good because their system of motor movements in their hands is already well developed.\"\n\nHis colleague, Tetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, agreed, telling BI that \"those who used to play video games, those who are accustomed to using a joystick, would be better in terms of running an FPV drone.\"\n\nTechnical fluency matters too. It's easier to train people with IT or engineering backgrounds than it is teachers, marketing specialists, or accountants. This war is one of rapidly evolving technology and tactics, especially in drone warfare.\n\nBeing an operator isn't just about physical control; it's about really understanding how drones work and what they can do. The school strives to instill these principles in all students.\n\nAnd gaming experience, technical knowledge, and flexible adaptation in the face of new technology tend to be more easily found among younger students. If they're over 50, Tetyana explained, \"it is a bit more challenging for students to get hold of controlling some types of drones.\"\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said someone who flies well isn't automatically a strong combat operator — but after a year of training, his team has identified what works.\n\n\"Young people aged 18-27 are the easiest to train,\" he said. \"They memorize information and acquire skills faster and more effectively. As we have noted, the older a person is, the more difficult it is for them to learn.\"\n\nSimilar to the other drone school leaders, Pervak said people who have a technical mindset can absorb training \"more easily and understand the intricacies of using UAVs in combat better.\" Those who were programmers and gamers often \"find it easiest to focus on a monitor for long periods of time. Everyone else must develop this skill.\"\n\nGood health is also key, but he said the school has nonetheless \"successfully trained people with visual and hearing impairments, back problems, contusions, and even head injuries.\"\n\nDrones account for about 60% of Ukraine's front-line strikes, according to the country's commander-in-chief. With shortages of artillery shells and other weaponry, Ukraine has leaned heavily on drones. The inexpensive systems have been highly effective at damaging and destroying equipment worth millions.\n\nCheap drones offer an asymmetric advantage and provide the Ukrainian military with combat power it couldn't generate with humans and crewed assets alone. But its drone force is only as strong as its pilots are capable, making drone training essential.\n\nThe drone school leaders are not alone in their assessment of who tends to make the best pilots.\n\nUkrainian soldiers with gaming backgrounds have also credited that experience for their skills, and Ukraine's special drone unit, Typhoon, previously told Business Insider that gamers make great drone pilots. But they also cautioned that real drone warfare is much more complicated and dangerous than any video game.\n\nOne Typhoon operator said that \"people think flying a military drone is like playing 'Call of Duty,' until they realize there's no restart option,\" referring to the popular video game.\n\nWestern drone pilots have previously expressed similar sentiments. Tanner Yackley, a former US Air Force drone operator who left in 2018, previously told Business Insider that it's fundamentally different because \"you're making life or death calls every single day.\"\n\n\"There's not a single game in the world that can prep you for what you're going to do,\" he said.\n\nAs NATO watches the war in Ukraine, worried about a wider conflict, its forces are already adapting and also looking to gamers, even embracing tech from the gaming world to make it easier for younger troops to quickly skill up on new technology.\n\nSome American and European troops, for instance, are training on a new air-defense system that uses an Xbox controller to launch interceptor drones.\n\nThe drone schools, however, are constantly grappling with challenges, such as limited funding, reliance on donated drones, and the threat of Russian strikes. They have to keep their curricula updated, with instructors traveling to the front and rewriting lessons every couple of weeks to match the rapid battlefield shifts.",

    "title": "Interceptor drones are taking over in Ukraine, but soldiers are still using machine guns to battle Russian threats",
    "description": "The drones are still in limited supply and are not always the ideal interception method, Ukrainian soldiers and an official told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces are still using decades-old machine guns and small arms to defend against Russian air attacks, even as cheap interceptor drones surge in popularity.\n\nInterceptor drones, which are armed with small warheads and fly directly into their targets or explode nearby to destroy them midair, have become a crucial tool for Ukraine as it struggles to defend against worsening Russian bombardments.\n\nHowever, Ukraine still doesn't have enough of these drones, and they aren't always the best tool for every intercept, making guns a practical fallback, Ukrainian soldiers and an official familiar with the security situation told Business Insider.\n\nOleksiy, the deputy commander of a Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces mobile air defense unit who could only be identified by his first name for security reasons, said his troops are training to use new interceptor drones to strengthen their arsenal.\n\nOleksiy's unit, tasked with protecting Irpin, a city on the outskirts of Ukraine's capital Kyiv, has historically used the .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun mounted on the bed of a pickup truck to battle the Russian one-way attack drones that are regularly launched at Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this year, though, Russia started modifying its drones to fly faster and at higher altitudes, beyond the range of the Browning, a popular US-made heavy weapon designed around the end of World War I.\n\nOleksiy said his unit is still using the Browning, but it hasn't scored any hits recently because the Russian drones are beyond its capabilities. He said that other Ukrainian air defenders also rely on the machine gun, which has decades of combat experience.\n\nOleksiy argued that guns will likely continue to have a role in air defense. Ultimately, soldiers will decide which weapon best suits their needs in the moment.\n\n\"Defense forces always use all available means of deterrence, and a machine gun is currently one of the cheapest means if there are enemy air targets in its range,\" he said.\n\nA special operator in Ukraine's 4th Ranger Regiment, who previously worked with the Browning in an air defense sub-unit, said the gun is a reliable weapon troops can master in just a few days.\n\nRussian drones don't always maintain a consistent altitude in flight; sometimes they fly closer to the ground, where they become vulnerable to the Browning, said Drago, who could only be identified by his call sign for security reasons.\n\nOfficials, however, would like to see a shift toward the newer capabilities. Yehor Cherniev, the deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, told Business Insider that air defenders still largely use \"outdated weapons,\" including guns, to battle Russian drones.\n\nCherniev said Ukraine is replacing these weapons with interceptor drones at a rapid pace, describing them as \"far more effective.\"\n\nHe said that \"due to a lack of funding and limited assistance from our partners, we have not yet been able to implement the use of interceptor drones everywhere and on the necessary scale.\" Limits on these capabilities leave crews dependent on older options that are useful but not always well-suited for the threat.\n\nInterceptor drones emerged earlier this year as a top defense priority for Ukraine because these systems are inexpensive and can be manufactured in large quantities. They are among the latest battlefield innovations and crucial technology as Kyiv faces growing Russian investment in its long-range drone operations and ever-expanding nightly attacks.\n\nSome Ukrainian interceptor drones are worth as little as $2,500; by comparison, Russia's one-way attack drones are estimated to cost $35,000 on the low end. Officials stress that it's crucial to be on the right end of the cost curve.\n\nUkraine's defense industry is now producing hundreds of interceptor drones daily, and the military frequently shares footage showing them downing Russian attack and reconnaissance drones.\n\nWestern military officials and Ukrainian organizations have said that interceptor drones are responsible for taking down thousands of Russian drones in combat.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO is taking note of the success of interceptor drones in Ukraine. Some allies have purchased and are deploying their own systems, recognizing the value as a low-cost air defense solution that doesn't necessarily require extensive training.\n\nOleksiy's unit began training on the new interceptor drones earlier in the fall, and they expect to wrap up soon. While he acknowledged that there is a bit of a learning curve, he said that it \"doesn't scare us.\"",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used naval drones packed with explosives to attack an oil tanker identified as part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Black Sea on Wednesday, a security source told Business Insider.\n\nThe naval drone strike on the tanker, Dashan, marks the third such attack in less than two weeks as Ukraine ramps up its long-range strike campaign against Russia's energy sector, increasingly gunning for ships at sea in addition to land-based oil facilities.\n\nSea Baby naval drones hit the tanker and caused \"critical damage\" to the vessel, with early indications indicating that the strike completely disabled the vessel, the source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the country's main internal security agency, revealed on Wednesday.\n\nThe SBU source, only authorized to speak anonymously to discuss sensitive military developments, said the Dashan was flying the Comoros flag and moving through Ukraine's exclusive economic zone in the direction of Novorossiysk, a Russian port city and major oil terminal.\n\nPublicly available ship-tracking data last showed the Dashan in the middle of the Black Sea.\n\nThe tanker was sailing at maximum speed with its transponder turned off, the security source said. They added that the attack was carried out in cooperation with the Ukrainian navy and shared footage captured by the Sea Baby drones showing multiple hits on the ship.\n\nSeveral Western countries and the European Union have sanctioned the $30 million tanker, which has been used for Russian oil exports and is known to sail with its transponder switched off, Ukraine's HUR military intelligence agency said.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the extent of the damage. Russia's defense ministry and its embassy in the US did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe attack on Wednesday appears to mark the third time in the last two weeks that Ukraine has disabled a tanker belonging to the \"shadow fleet.\" In late November, the SBU used naval drones to strike and damage two vessels before they loaded at Novorossiysk.\n\nThe \"shadow fleet\" is a collection of hundreds of vessels that Moscow uses to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports, a major source of revenue. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly urged Kyiv's international partners to do more to prevent the ships from operating.\n\n\"The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce the receipt of petrodollars to the budget of the Russian Federation,\" the security source said on Wednesday, according to a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\nUkraine has been stepping up its attacks against the Russian energy sector, the revenue from which fuels its war efforts, in recent months. Kyiv has used long-range drones to strike oil refineries and other facilities and infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe three tanker attacks appear to reflect a new shift for Ukraine — one that now increasingly attacks ships at sea rather than just land targets.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Almost four years into Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine, European Union leaders have committed to funding Kyiv’s economic and military needs for the next two years, one way or another. Ukraine is desperate and needs the money by early 2026.\n\nAt a summit next week, the 27 EU leaders will weigh whether to use tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to help meet Ukraine’s requirements, which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion).\n\nSuch a move has never been done before, and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries' money, it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.\n\nBelgium, where most of the assets are held, is the main opponent of the plan. It’s fearful that Russia will strike back, either through the courts or in more nefarious ways. A series of drone incidents near airports and military bases last month suggested that the Kremlin was already doing so, but those responsible were never publicly identified.\n\nEuropean Council President Antonio Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit, has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision.\n\nEU leaders froze the money, most of it in Russian Central Bank assets, over the war that Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the scheme as “theft.”\n\nTwo plans have emerged. The first would be a “reparations loan” that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Russian President Vladimir Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.\n\nPlan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets, much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany of Europe’s major economies are cash strapped and mired in debt. But Russia’s war on Ukraine poses an existential threat to the bloc. Intelligence assessments suggest that Putin could launch a war elsewhere in three to five years should he defeat Ukraine.\n\nThe assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, estimates that 210 billion ($244 billion) euros worth of frozen assets are currently held in Europe. The vast majority — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.\n\nThere are political advantages too. Should the EU choose to use the assets, only “a qualified majority” of countries — around a two-thirds majority — would be required for a green light. Borrowing on financial markets would have to be endorsed by all, meaning that even a single no vote would sink the idea.\n\nOver the last year, Hungary has blocked EU support for Ukraine at almost every turn. The government in Slovakia is starting to dig in its heels as well. A new and stridently nationalist leader in the Czech Republic could further complicate the decision.\n\nAvoiding a veto is in the interest of the vast majority of member countries.\n\nDetails of the reparations loan\n\nUnveiling her plan on Dec. 4, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s needs for 2026 and 2027, for a total of 90 billion euros ($105 billion). International partners would fill the gap.\n\nDue to EU sanctions on Russia’s assets, cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. They’ve generated interest — some 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion) this year, Euroclear says — which is already being used to fund a Group of Seven loan plan for Ukraine.\n\nUnder the new plan, some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc’s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.\n\nThe commission insists that there is no “theft,” as Russia has claimed, because the right of the Russian Central Bank to make a claim on its money and Euroclear’s duty to repay will remain intact.\n\nOnce Putin pays war reparations, Ukraine would repay the EU, the EU would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay the Russian Central Bank.\n\nImportantly for Belgium, the plan contains safeguards to ensure that the risks would be shared by its partners. Other EU countries would offer to guarantee the loan if something went wrong. Germany has already signaled that it would do so.\n\nBut the Belgian government has not been assuaged. Even before the commission's reparations loan plan was made public, Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that it “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks.”\n\nPrévot said Belgium — a strong backer of Ukraine that has provided military and financial support — feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.\n\n“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return,” he said.\n\nIn an interview with Belgian public broadcaster RTBF last week, Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain also said that court action could not be ruled out should the EU oblige the clearinghouse to transfer its Russian assets.",

    "fullText": "Ground drones are growing more popular on Ukraine's front lines, but they're still vastly overshadowed by the small aerial drones made famous in the war.\n\nIn November, uncrewed ground vehicles accounted for less than 0.66% of Ukraine's total drone missions.\n\nUsage numbers were announced on Tuesday by Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, as he gave a statement on the war situation this winter.\n\n\"At the current stage of the war, it is unmanned aerial vehicles that provide about 60% of all strikes on enemy targets,\" Syrskyi wrote.\n\nThe military chief said that in November alone, Ukrainian uncrewed aerial vehicles, or UAVs, carried out over 304,000 missions, striking or destroying roughly 81,500 targets.\n\n\"Over the past six months, this indicator has been constantly growing,\" Syrskyi added.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian uncrewed ground vehicles, or UGVs, carried out 2,000 missions in the same timeframe, he said.\n\nThe statistics underscore just how aerial drones continue to dominate the battlefield in Ukraine. UGVs, an emerging technology, are still finding their footing in the war as Kyiv moves to integrate them at a wider scale among its military units.\n\nAmid the push, dozens of Ukrainian companies and units have been debuting their own UGVs, which can range from miniature buggies to full-size trucks mounted with remote machine gun turrets.\n\nThe ground drones are particularly useful because they can perform dangerous frontline missions that human soldiers would otherwise be required to carry out. Ukrainians are building them to serve a variety of purposes, from direct assaults and mine-clearing to monitoring roads and delivering frontline supplies.\n\nSome units have begun using aerial and ground systems in tandem, such as troops in Pokrovsk who used a UGV to spot incoming Russian vehicles through fog and later attacked with exploding drones.\n\nRussia has also been pioneering new drones, including UGVs for logistics and rocket artillery. On the aerial front, the Kremlin's forces were the first to introduce unjammable, fiber-optic drones that are now proliferating on the battlefield.\n\nThis year, Moscow has repeatedly been reported to be more readily integrating drone warfare into its ranks, scaling up mass production, forming official drone units, and creating new warfighting doctrine after observing Ukrainian tactics.\n\nSyrskyi wrote that Russia had, at one point, reached a \"period of a certain parity\" with Ukraine in the use of first-person-view drones, or the small hobby drones souped up to fly explosives into targets.\n\n\"As reported by our intelligence bodies, the enemy seeks to reach monthly deliveries of up to half a million FPV drones to its troops,\" he wrote.\n\nNow, however, Syrskyi claimed that Ukraine has recently surpassed Russia in first-person-view drone usage.\n\n\"The Ukrainian response must be asymmetric and effective: strengthening the fight against enemy drones and destroying the infrastructure of the enemy's unmanned forces units,\" he added.\n\nSyrskyi's statement offered a grim recap of the war in recent months, saying that Ukraine's forces have \"faced some of the most serious challenges since the beginning of the full-scale war.\"\n\nBoth civilians and soldiers in the country must soon grapple with another brutal winter, as temperatures are expected to consistently drop below freezing in January and February. Russia has been targeting local energy grids, disrupting Ukraine's access to reliable heating.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had no time to hold a traditional news conference during a whirlwind, 36-hour trip across Europe this week, so he improvised.\n\nFor the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of his country, Zelenskyy — who usually takes reporters’ questions in person while trotting the globe — communicated with the news media via group chat. While flying between London and Brussels, he answered a long list of questions from Ukrainian and international reporters, relaying audio clips on WhatsApp.\n\nHis chosen mode of communication was, if not unprecedented, at the very least extremely rare for a world leader.\n\nThe low drone of the aircraft blended with his hoarse, tired-sounding voice, yet his message cut through clearly: Amid uncertain negotiations to end the war, Ukraine, he said, cannot surrender land.\n\n“Undoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories,” he said in a crackling message late Monday. “According to the law, we don’t have such a right … and to be frank, we don’t have a moral right either.”\n\nWith the outlook for negotiations changing by the day, Zelenskyy’s team set out on a jam-packed schedule to shore up support in Europe.\n\nZelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nA key issue being discussed is whether Ukraine should cede Russian‑occupied territory in return for security guarantees, but the talks have been complicated by uncertainty about the Trump administration’s commitment to European security.\n\nSince the start of the war, Zelenskyy has shown a desire to communicate in real-time in whatever way is necessary.\n\nWhen Kyiv came under siege shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Zelenskyy tried to reassure the public through what appeared to be a cellphone video with three top officials — perhaps his best-known address.\n\n“We are all here,” he said at the time. “Our soldiers are here, the citizens of our country are all here protecting our independence, and we are going to continue to do so.”\n\nSince then, Zelenskyy has made frequent communication a strategic priority in a sleep-defying cycle of video messages, remote speeches to Western parliaments and conferences, late-night posts and high-security public appearances.\n\nMonday night’s WhatsApp exchange wound down as his plane landed in Brussels, just before he was whisked into his next round of meetings.\n\nHe asked reporters: “How did you like this format? If it works for you, then when we have the opportunity, we’ll share our thoughts and decisions this way again.”\n\nIt didn't take long. By Tuesday evening, Zelenskyy had sent reporters more audio messages on WhatsApp to explain how talks to end the war were proceeding with its Western allies.",

    "description": "With the proliferation of drones on the battlefield in Ukraine, European militaries are racing to better arm their forces.",
    "fullText": "European militaries are showing growing interest in a technology that turns standard service rifles into last-resort drone killers, an Israeli weapons maker says, as countries look for cheaper ways to counter the surge in uncrewed systems.\n\nA representative of firearms manufacturer Israel Weapon Industries told Business Insider that at least 10 European countries have either purchased or shown interest in the Arbel system, a micro-computer intended to better optimize a gun for shooting down drones, since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022.\n\nIWI declined to name buyers and interested parties. But Europe has grown increasingly interested in anti-drone defenses.\n\nDrones have dominated the battlefield in this war, providing Ukraine and Russia with constant surveillance and precision-strike capabilities. As both sides develop cheap ways to deal with the threat, countries closely watching the conflict from the sidelines are investing in the same.\n\nIWI said that its Arbel system is already in use with an undisclosed number of militaries around the world, said Semion, the head of Europe for the company, who requested to be identified only by his first name for security reasons.\n\nHe said that by next year, given current trends, he expects that 40 to 50% of European countries will either have procured the Arbel system or be close to doing so, reflecting growing investment in cost-efficient anti-drone defenses across the continent.\n\nDrones of all shapes, sizes, and functions are playing key roles on the battlefield in Ukraine, but one of the most problematic for soldiers on both sides is the small quadcopter known as a first-person-view (FPV) system.\n\nFPV drones are often armed with explosives that turn them into inexpensive precision-strike weapons. To defeat them, soldiers use signal jamming to interfere with their signal connections.\n\nHowever, FPV drones are increasingly being controlled by fiber-optic cables that connect directly with an operator rather than radio frequencies, making them immune to electronic warfare. The only option is to shoot them down with small arms, but even that requires precision and a lot of luck.\n\nDrones are hard targets to hit, in many cases, with anything other than a shotgun, and even then, there's no guarantee. They can move quickly and in unexpected ways.\n\nWith drones cementing themselves as a permanent feature of the modern battlefield, militaries are racing to acquire personal anti-drone defenses, like Arbel, in case soldiers find themselves on the receiving end of one of these weapons.\n\nArbel is a tiny computerized system that can be integrated into light machine guns or assault rifles, giving a soldier a more accurate shot on the battlefield in scenarios that require quick reactions or against moving targets — such as small drones, Semion said.\n\nWhen activated, the system lets a soldier hold down the trigger while Arbel automatically releases rounds at the moments they're most likely to hit the target. It can bring down drones at roughly 450 meters in daylight and 200 meters at night.\n\nThe system's sensors study the shooter's behavior — their weapon movement, stability, and trigger pressure. With the trigger held down, all the soldier needs to do is keep the drone in their sight; Arbel decides exactly when each round should go.\n\nArbel is battery-powered and adds about 400 grams to the gun, and soldiers can adapt quickly. Semion said the system is inexpensive but declined to disclose any specifics on the cost.\n\nSemion likened the system to equipping a soldier with a helmet and bulletproof vest, saying that drones today \"are the new bullets on the battlefield.\"\n\nArbel itself doesn't necessarily know what it's shooting at. Semion said it's up to the soldier to engage targets responsibly.\n\nEarly versions of Arbel have been on the market for a few years now, but only recently — after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and drone usage exploded on the battlefield — has the system been viewed as a viable anti-drone solution.\n\nEuropean nations, in particular, are acutely aware of the rising drone threat, and there is increasing demand for counter-drone solutions.\n\nArbel is one of several systems that offers to help soldiers use small arms to battle the drone threat without needing to pack on too much extra gear.\n\nLast year, Business Insider observed US soldiers training to shoot down drones with the Smart Shooter — a rifle equipped with a special optic that tracks the threat, calculates its trajectory, and notifies the user when they have a reasonable chance of hitting it.\n\nAnd this year, Business Insider observed AimLock target recognition technology at a special operations event, where the company's CEO talked about how this tech could support the counter-drone fight by enhancing various weapons.\n\nBeyond rifle attachments and fresh pitches for shotguns as drone defense, Western countries are also racing to develop interceptor drones as an anti-drone capability, following Ukraine, which has invested heavily in the production of these small systems and uses them widely to take down Russian threats.",
