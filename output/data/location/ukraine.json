    "description": "Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves ​of Russian attacks on its infrastructure, mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters on Friday.\n\nKyiv, one of Eastern ‌Europe's largest cities, requires 1,700 megawatts of electricity to power the services for its 3.6 million people, Klitschko said.\n\nKlitschko said the current energy crisis ‌was the most difficult challenge facing the capital in the nearly four years since Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\n\"It's the first time in the history of our city that, in such severe frosts, most of the city was left without heating and with a huge shortage of electricity,\" Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, said in an interview ⁠in his office at the heart of ‌Kyiv.\n\nSome Kyiv residents face up to 18 to 20 hours a day without mains electricity. Ukraine declared an energy emergency this week as its grid crumbles due to accumulated wartime ‍damage and a new targeted wave of Russian bombardments.\n\nBitter cold weather with icy rain and snow exacerbated the challenges. Nighttime minimum temperatures have dipped to around -17 Celsius (1 Fahrenheit) in Kyiv this week.\n\nFAST REPAIRS, GENERATORS AND INTERNATIONAL AID\n\nKlitschko said Ukraine's international partners had ​rushed in additional generators, and repair teams had worked round the clock to restore heating following a Russian ‌strike last week that knocked out supplies to 6,000 apartment buildings.\n\nAbout 100 buildings still have no heating, he said.\n\n\"We're not just working during the day now, we're working at night too,\" he said. \"There is no such thing as the start and end of the working day for us.\"\n\nIn addition to repairs and generators, the city opened about 1,300 sites with heaters to help residents keep warm, and was working to install mini thermal power stations in ⁠some districts to decentralize electricity and heating.\n\nWith generators, the priority was ​to provide electricity to ensure water supplies and power hospitals, kindergartens, ​and other key critical infrastructure, Klitschko said. About 300 tonnes of fuel a day were needed to do that.\n\nKlitschko reiterated his call for Kyiv residents to leave the city if they ‍have the opportunity to do ⁠so to ease the pressure on its infrastructure.\n\nSchools in Kyiv extended their winter holidays, and many commercial companies have switched to remote work arrangements.\n\nKlitschko said that despite all the challenges, city officials were determined to ⁠restore heating supplies in full, and they were also planning for backup scenarios in case new Russian air strikes damage the energy infrastructure.\n\n\"This ‌winter will be difficult, but we are doing everything that's possible and impossible,\" Klitschko said.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Olena Harmash; editing by Daniel Flynn and Alex Richardson)",

    "description": "The fight in Ukraine changes so rapidly that weapons makers can't afford to constantly overhaul and redevelop whole systems.",
    "fullText": "The battlefield in Ukraine is changing constantly, and weapons makers are rushing to keep up.\n\nDrone and ground robot makers said they're designing their systems in ways that allow them to be easily updated.\n\nThey're either modular, meaning parts can be swapped out, or designed so software changes are all that's needed.\n\nRapid changes on the battlefield in Ukraine are prompting Western weapons manufacturers to reassess how military technology is developed and upgraded.\n\nWith the fight evolving quickly, arms companies in Ukraine and Europe say that they can't afford to start from scratch and completely redesign entire systems each time conditions shift.\n\nInstead, companies making aerial drones and ground robots told Business Insider that their focus is now on creating weapons that can be upgraded by simply changing parts or software rather than overhauling the whole system.\n\nDesigns are modular, like Lego pieces, with parts being easily swapped out as new mission demands arise. Increasingly, companies are turning to software-first designs for more convenient upgrades.\n\nDefense technology has been moving in this direction, but revelations from Russia's war against Ukraine are injecting new urgency.\n\nPatrick Shepherd, the chief sales officer for Milrem Robotics, an Estonian company that makes autonomous uncrewed ground vehicles and has some in Ukraine, said that these changes are key to staying ahead, as they provide much faster adaptation than what \"traditional, monolithic designs\" permit.\n\nUkraine's soldiers say that battlefield tech can become out of date in weeks and months, with electronic warfare, new drone countermeasures, and new tactics blunting once-effective systems.\n\nAmong the companies involved in this evolving technology battle is DroneShield, an Australian company that develops counter-drone technology and operates across Europe. It has multimillion-dollar US military contracts and has multiple systems in Ukraine.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of DroneShield's US arm, said that the drone and counter-drone fight has sped up globally since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, cutting development cycles to weeks rather than months or years.\n\nThe only way to keep pace, he said, is to build \"systems that are not fixed, solving the problem of today, but ones that can address an issue today and adapt as needed.\"\n\nLithuanian drone company Granta Autonomy was one of the first companies to send drones to Ukraine. CEO Gediminas Guoba said the company needs to build systems that are not simply ready for this year or the next, but can be updated and upgraded for new operations even further into the future.\n\nThat means building systems that can be easily reworked. Anything else, he said, and \"we will lose the battle.\"\n\nMcCrann said the faster development cycle is why DroneShield has put greater emphasis on modular and adaptable designs.\n\nLikewise, Shepherd said that Milrem builds flexibility into its systems from the outset, allowing sensors, payloads, mission systems, and other components to be integrated, removed, or upgraded without redesigning the entire vehicle.\n\nAchi, the CEO of Ukraine's Ark Robotics, which makes autonomous robots used by nearly two dozen Ukrainian brigades, said the company focuses on making its platforms \"as cheap and as mass producible as possible.\" He spoke to Business Insider using a pseudonym as a security precaution.\n\n\"And then when we get this right, we can do surface-level customization,\" like adding armor or additional equipment. The base platform remains the same, letting the company scale production without driving up costs.\n\nLatvia-based Origin Robotics manufactures both drones and drone interceptors used by Ukrainian and NATO forces. Its CEO, Agris Kipurs, told BI that the company also prioritizes modular systems to adapt quickly to battlefield changes.\n\nModular designs aren't just for companies striving to keep their edge in a competitive industry. Warfighters need them too. Ukrainian soldiers have said they need flexible systems that can be easily modified at the front.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, the head of robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that the ground robots his unit uses can be configured for different missions, be it evacuating wounded troops or attacking Russian positions. He said the robots work like Lego bricks.\n\nShepherd said that Milrem's robots follow the same logic, avoiding designs built around a single mission. They can be customized by soldiers for evacuation, explosive disposal, intelligence gathering, or weaponized roles.\n\nIn some cases, soldiers adapt systems in ways manufacturers did not anticipate.\n\nWestern companies say they are learning from those changes. McCrann said Ukraine has been technologically innovative \"because they have to be,\" and that this is driving industry adaptation.\n\nCompanies sometimes have group chats and FaceTime calls with Ukrainian soldiers to get real-time feedback, and weapons software is where they can make the biggest changes the fastest.\n\nShepherd said that software is now playing a central role in adapting systems, whether for command-and-control integration or mission management. \"Software updates can be developed, tested, and deployed much more quickly, allowing lessons learned from the field to be integrated on shorter timescales,\" he said.\n\nMcCrann said DroneShield has focused on a software-first approach, where upgrades add new capabilities without hardware modifications.\n\nGuoba said Granta Autonomy's drones have not changed much over the last year or two, but the software inside them, on the other hand, \"is changing every month.\"\n\nSoftware can be remotely pushed to weaponry already in Ukraine, eliminating the need to ship gear back to the factory. That speed, and the ability to test changes quickly, has made software the preferred tool for rapid adaptation.\n\nUltimately, Ark Robotics' Achi said, \"software is easier to do.\"\n\nArk's aerial drones and ground robots rely on onboard and server-based software, and the company is developing systems to allow thousands of platforms to operate together with minimal human involvement.\n\nHe said Ark also deploys engineers forward to implement software changes tailored to specific units or missions. It follows a similar approach for hardware, though those changes take longer to implement.\n\nKipurs said Origin makes its systems \"software-intensive\" so development is continuous, \"with updates regularly pushed to improve systems that have already been delivered.\"\n\nIt only uses hardware changes \"when they provide clear benefits across all intended users.\" Because the company also builds for NATO customers, systems must remain broadly interoperable.\n\nShepherd said companies still need to strike a balance. Systems must remain reliable, so not every update can be rushed to the field. The key, he said, is close collaboration with Ukrainian soldiers and fast but disciplined feedback loops.",

    "description": "Macron said that Ukraine was previously \"overwhelmingly dependent\" on US intelligence, but that France is now providing \"two-thirds\" of that service.",
    "fullText": "French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that his country has now overtaken the US as the main provider of intelligence to Ukraine.\n\n\"Where Ukraine was overwhelmingly dependent on American intelligence capacity, a year ago, two-thirds is today provided by France. Two-thirds,\" Macron said in a New Year's speech to the French military.\n\nThe French leader's comments indicate a shift in the dynamics of Western contributions to the war and suggest that the US may have scaled back its military relationship with Ukraine.\n\nThe US briefly suspended intelligence-sharing and aid to Ukraine in March 2025, as the Trump administration was attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Kyiv and Moscow. After roughly a week, Washington said it was lifting the suspension.\n\nBut it's been unclear so far whether the Pentagon has continued to provide intelligence at the same level as it did during the Biden administration.\n\nThe New York Times previously reported that, in those years, US-Ukrainian intelligence-sharing ties had been so close that officials from both countries worked in the same facility to coordinate military strikes.\n\nOne of the most vital roles played by US intelligence at the time was providing targeting data and situational awareness for Ukrainian troops, especially when the latter were using American-made systems for the attacks.\n\nUkraine has since been trying to develop its own strike capabilities, including long-range precision missiles, that might allow it to strike Russia without Western approval.\n\nIt's also unclear exactly how Macron quantified two-thirds of Ukrainian intelligence capabilities. His speech did not say whether he was referring to two-thirds of the intelligence provided by Ukraine's foreign partners or to two-thirds of all the intelligence used by Ukraine's forces.\n\nThe Élysée Palace and French defense ministry did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours. Ukraine's defense ministry and the Pentagon have also not responded to similar requests for comment on Macron's remarks.\n\nThe French president's point on intelligence-sharing with Ukraine aligns with his larger push to position Paris as a regional military leader, while the Trump administration seeks to curb American involvement in Europe. President Donald Trump has also recently rattled European leaders by alluding that the US could try to take over Greenland, a Danish territory.\n\nMacron said on Thursday that France had helped Ukraine to rebuild its forces and provided Kyiv with security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire.\n\nLast week, European NATO members and the US issued a declaration that said willing countries would form a multinational, \"European-led\" force to provide \"reassurances\" to Ukraine and stave off a second Russian invasion or attack.\n\n\"The signal sent to our Ukrainian partners, to other Europeans, and to the world is that we are ready,\" Macron said. \"We are ready to sustain this effort of resistance. We are ready to deter new aggressions or to maintain peace on our soil.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is pointing the finger at an unlikely target after his much-touted efforts to broker an end to the war in Ukraine failed to gain traction.\n\nAsked why U.S.-led peace talks have stalled, Trump blamed the victim of the invasion, claiming it was the Ukrainian leader’s fault. Asked directly what was standing in the way, he gave a one-word answer to Reuters: “Zelensky.”\n\nAt the same time, Trump argued that Moscow is prepared to conclude the conflict, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin is eager to bring the nearly four-year invasion to a close. “I think he’s ready to make a deal,” Trump said, adding, “I think Ukraine is less ready to make a deal.”\n\nOn Thursday, the Kremlin said they agree with Trump’s remarks, which are in contrast to those of European allies, who have long maintained that Moscow is not genuinely interested in ending the conflict, instead aiming to seize additional territory while avoiding new Western sanctions.\n\nTrump, who previously said he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine “in a day” if he won a second term, has frequently clashed with Zelensky over the past year.\n\nNegotiations took a sharp turn in March last year when a public clash between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office derailed a widely promoted agreement that would have given the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, with the Ukrainian president leaving the White House without signing the deal. In the aftermath, Trump briefly halted military assistance and intelligence sharing, though both were restored the following month.\n\nSince then, the interactions between the two presidents have improved, with Ukrainian officials being deeply involved in recent peace talks, led by the U.S.\n\nRecent U.S.-led diplomacy has focused on what security guarantees Ukraine would receive after a ceasefire to prevent another Russian attack. As part of those discussions, American negotiators have broadly urged Kyiv to consider relinquishing control of the eastern Donbas region in exchange for an agreement with Russia.\n\nZelensky, however, has repeatedly rejected any suggestion of territorial concessions, insisting Ukraine’s constitution bars the government from surrendering any of its land to Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces have continued to press their offensive in Ukraine despite Trump’s claims that his pressure campaign and peace efforts are gaining traction with the Kremlin.\n\nIn mid-January, Moscow confirmed the launch of a hypersonic Oreshnik missile into western Ukraine near the EU border, a high-speed strike that hit infrastructure in the Lviv region. Western officials condemned it as an escalation even as peace proposals were being discussed.\n\nAt the same time, Russia has repeatedly carried out large waves of missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure while diplomatic talks have continued. In December, Ukrainian authorities reported hundreds of drones and missiles targeting power stations and other sites across the country, causing multiple injuries and widespread damage even as discussions on ending the war persisted.\n\nMoscow’s foreign ministry has also signaled reluctance to accept partial ceasefires as credible.\n\nIn his New Year’s message, Zelensky warned that Moscow was deliberately continuing its war, saying that “Russia deliberately brings war” with night time shelling and large drone attacks, and thanked Ukrainian defenders for repelling many of them.\n\nWhen asked why he believes Zelensky has resisted moving forward with peace talks, Trump told Reuters: “I just think he’s, you know, having a hard time getting there.”",

    "title": "Ukraine's new defense minister just outlined how dire its troop shortage has become",
    "description": "In his remarks at Ukraine's parliament, Mykhailo Fedorov warned of nearly 2 million Ukrainians dodging the military draft.",
    "fullText": "Around 2 million Ukrainians are dodging military drafts, while another 200,000 are absent without official leave, or AWOL, Kyiv's newly appointed defense minister said on Wednesday.\n\nThe tally revealed by Mykhailo Fedorov is a rare disclosure by the Ukrainian leadership about the troop shortages the country has grappled with throughout the war.\n\nFedorov, who was previously minister of digital transformation, was speaking in Ukraine's parliament as representatives confirmed his new appointment in the defense role.\n\nThe defense minister said roughly 2 million Ukrainians are \"wanted\" for evading callups, with another 200,000 soldiers voluntarily leaving their posts without permission to do so.\n\nFedorov has pledged wide reform, saying he would audit Ukraine's military and root out systemic issues \"that have accumulated over the years\" in training and command.\n\n\"We cannot fight with new technologies under an old organizational structure,\" Fedorov said.\n\nUnder martial law in Ukraine, going AWOL is defined as being away without permission for more than three days, an act that can carry a prison sentence of between five to 10 years. Desertion is when a soldier is deemed to be intentionally avoiding service and carries a more severe sentence of up to 12 years in prison.\n\nA soldier could go AWOL if they are given a break from the fighting or leave to return home, then fail to show up when ordered to do so. Sometimes, troops simply flee their positions.\n\nThe figures relayed by Fedorov may be affected by a notorious tactic among Ukrainian troops seeking to transfer to another unit, especially if they were previously denied. Some soldiers try to circumvent the official process by going AWOL and then reporting for duty again with a recommendation for their desired unit.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general's office told local media outlet Ukrainska Pravda last year that, from the start of the war to September 2025, it had opened over 235,000 criminal cases for AWOL-related offenses, as well as over 53,000 for desertion.\n\nAs a loose comparison, some records say that a rough total of 150,000 American and British troops deserted or went AWOL during World War II across the entire European theater.\n\nAnother key concern implied in Fedorov's speech is the sheer scale of missing recruits that Kyiv desperately needs.\n\nThe country is already straining against Russia's much larger war economy and military industrial complex, and one of its most pressing needs is to replenish its fighters on the front lines.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that his country fields around 880,000 active-duty personnel, though other estimates vary.\n\nThe lack of reinforcements is crushing both for Ukrainian morale and operational success. Without reinforcements, some Ukrainian units have reported holding frontline positions for years with barely any rest or opportunity to rotate out to see their families.\n\nIn the city of Pokrovsk, for example, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv's troops were outnumbered 1 to 8 in the fall, when Russia aggressively tried to take control of the devastated regional hub via repeated ground assaults.\n\nUkrainian men aged 25 to 60 are eligible to be called up for active duty, though those as young as 18 must register with the military. Thousands of Ukrainian men have fled overseas since the war started. Many have done so illegally; Ukraine doesn't allow men aged 23 to 60 to leave its borders.\n\nFedorov said a key focus of his audit would be to assess what Ukraine can do more efficiently with the troops it has now. One of these reform goals is to ensure basic-level staffing in all of Ukraine's drone brigades, which he said is now \"definitely lacking.\"\n\n\"Today, the top 50 out of 400 total units involved in drones provide 70% of enemy damage,\" he said. \"Imagine the potential of the defense forces if we help the remaining 350 grow.\"\n\nThe defense minister, who is 35, also said the Ukrainian military is starting the year with considerably fewer resources. Its budget for 2026 is roughly 300 billion Ukrainian hryvnias, or $7 billion, lower than that for 2025, Fedorov said.",

The former head of Ukraine’s digital transformation policies is credited with spearheading the the army's drone technology and introducing several successful e-government platforms.\n\nHis appointment was part of a broad government reshuffle that the Ukrainian leader said aimed to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy amid a new U.S.-led push to find a peace settlement.\n\nFedorov said the defense ministry is facing a shortfall of 300 billion hryvnia ($6.9 billion) in funding needs.\n\nThe European Union will dedicate most of a massive new loan program to help fund Ukraine’s military and economy over the next two years, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday.\n\nFedorov said Ukraine’s defense sector has expanded significantly since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. At the start of the war, he said, the country had seven private drone companies and two firms developing electronic warfare systems. Today, he said, there are nearly 500 drone manufacturers and about 200 electronic warfare companies in Ukraine.\n\nHe added that some sectors have emerged from scratch, including private missile producers, which now number about 20, and more than 100 companies manufacturing ground-based robotic systems.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Up to 25,000 Russian soldiers are being killed every month, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said this week.",
    "fullText": "Russia's military is suffering heavy losses fighting in Ukraine, with up to 25,000 soldiers killed a month, NATO's top civilian official said this week, calling the carnage \"unsustainable\" for Moscow.\n\n\"The Russians, at the moment, are losing massive amounts of their soldiers thanks to the Ukrainian defense,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told European lawmakers at a forum in Brussels on Tuesday. He said that 20,000 to 25,000 troops are dying each month as the war drags on.\n\n\"I'm not talking seriously wounded. Killed.\" Rutte clarified. He compared the incredibly high losses to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, where an estimated 15,000 of its soldiers were killed over a period of more than nine years.\n\n\"Now they lose this amount or \n\nRussia has not disclosed official casualty figures, but Ukrainian and Western estimates paint a grim picture for Moscow.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said in an intelligence update Wednesday that Russia has likely suffered over 1.2 million battlefield casualties since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, averaging 1,100 soldiers killed and wounded every day last month.\n\nRussia's average daily casualty rate from August to December 2025 increased steadily, although it was still lower than during the same months in 2024, according to the ministry. It said the recent uptick came as Moscow made small territorial gains, and the heavy losses are expected to roll into 2026 \"with continued dismounted infantry attacks on multiple axes.\"\n\nRussian forces have been focused on seizing the war-torn city of Pokrovsk in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region for more than a year. It has been the site of some of the war's most intense fighting.\n\nUkrainian officials have said that attack drones are the biggest battlefield killer of people and equipment, believed to be responsible for eliminating around 90% of all targets hit. Military units regularly publish footage of their combat kills on social media.\n\nThe casualty assessments underscore the significant attrition for Russia. It has a much larger population pool from which it can pull new soldiers and replenish losses than Ukraine does. However, Moscow has tried to avoid large-scale involuntary mobilization during the war, and conflict analysts believe it is unlikely to do so anytime soon.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, a Russia research fellow with the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, told Business Insider that Moscow has increasingly relied on covert and informal recruitment networks to avoid a full mobilization, which would likely come at a tremendous political cost.\n\nRussian military efforts to bring fresh troops into its war against Ukraine include offering financial benefits to some informal recruiters, sourcing combat personnel from overseas, and playing with the legislation on the use of active and inactive reserves, among some other unofficial methods, Stepanenko said.\n\n\"Before, the Kremlin just assigned your military recruitment centers, some paramilitary organizations, and regional authorities to do recruitment,\" she said. Now, Moscow has to think: \"Where else can we squeeze recruits from?\"\n\nUS and Ukrainian assessments from last year suggested that Russia was pulling an average of 30,000 to 36,000 new soldiers a month into the war, figures similar to its casualty rate. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said thousands more than that are volunteering.\n\n\"It is certainly a challenge for Russian forces to replace personnel and replace the casualties,\" Stepanenko said, adding that Russia will eventually \"hit a wall\" if it doesn't change its personnel and recruitment system eventually.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine, which does not disclose official casualty figures similar to Russia, is believed to have suffered an estimated 400,000 soldiers killed and wounded. Those losses hit hard, as Ukraine faces a constant struggle for manpower.\n\nThe proliferation of drones over the battlefield has made it increasingly difficult to evacuate casualties from a widening kill zone that extends in both directions along the front line, significantly contributing to the heavy losses.\n\nUkrainian and Western soldiers and officers have said that \"golden hour\" — the first 60 minutes after a severe injury when medical treatment determines whether a soldier lives or dies — is long gone in this war.",

    "description": "Ukraine's air command for the central region published video of the Tempest firing what appear to be Hellfire Longbow missiles into the night sky.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's air defense forces said they've destroyed at least 21 Russian Shaheds with a new American light vehicle that fires guided missiles from its back.\n\nThe vehicle, called the Tempest, featured in a video posted on Tuesday by Ukraine's Air Command for the country's central region.\n\nThe footage showed at least three video clips of the system firing into the night sky, its missile arcing upward to track its target.\n\n\"As of now, our crew has destroyed 21 Shahed drones,\" said a Ukrainian soldier, identified by Air Command Central as an operator with the call-sign \"Shorty,\" in the video.\n\nThe four-wheeled, off-road buggy is equipped with a dual launcher that appears to be fitted with missiles that look like the AGM-114 Hellfire.\n\nThese American-made missiles typically require the assistance of a laser to track their targets and are often fired from aircraft such as the MQ-9 Reaper and the AH-64 Apache.\n\nThe Tempest, however, likely uses the Longbow variant, which instead uses radar to home in on targets in a fire-and-forget fashion. The Hellfire Longbow carries a 9-kilogram, or 20-pound, warhead.\n\nThe Ukrainian video did not specifically identify the type of missile used. The company that built the Tempest, V2X, is a Virginia-headquartered firm that's also pitching the vehicle to the US Army.\n\n\"This machine keeps the sky locked down,\" Shorty said in the air command video.\n\nHe added that his crew was previously deployed to Ukraine's eastern regions, saying that they destroyed \"all targets\" they attacked there.\n\nOther clips of the Tempest in action showed the buggy maneuvering in open fields, muddy terrain, and on a road.\n\nMobility is a key need for Ukraine's fight against Russian Shahed drones. Because these loitering munitions fly at speeds exceeding 100 mph, air defense crews only have a short time after detecting a target to arrive at an ideal firing location and launch.\n\nUkrainian troops once relied on trucks mounted with machine guns, but had to scramble for other options as Russia significantly increased the number of drones launched and started adapting to fly Shaheds at higher altitudes.\n\nThe sheer quantity of Shaheds that Ukraine often faces means that it needs lower-cost munitions to take them down.\n\nA congressional report from 2021 said that from 1998 to that year, the US spent roughly $10.9 billion, adjusted for inflation, on buying about 87,500 Hellfire missiles. That's about $123,000 per missile, though that figure would also include costs such as training, launchers, software, and support equipment.\n\nPrices can also vary for different variants of the missile, and the Longbow's radar guidance likely results in it being on the more expensive side.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian officials estimate that Russia can produce older Shaheds at roughly $35,000 each, though Moscow was believed to likely be making them at $70,000 apiece in 2025.\n\nIt's unclear what the cost ratio is between a Tempest launch and a Shahed or Gerbera, which are decoy drones that Russia deploys to give Ukrainians more targets to attack.\n\nWhen debuting the Tempest to the US Army in October 2025, V2X said the vehicle is made with commercial off-the-shelf components and can be offered as a stationary, trailer-mounted launcher.\n\nIt's also unclear how many Tempests are deployed in Ukraine. Only one vehicle appears onscreen at a time, and Ukraine is known to openly invite foreign weapons companies to test their products on the battlefield.\n\nNotably, the same clips of the Tempest firing, cropped to conceal the vehicle, appeared in an earlier New Year's montage published by Air Command Central, indicating that the vehicle has been in Ukraine since December.\n\nUkraine has increasingly relied on small first-person-view drones that are tweaked to fly extremely quickly and serve as interceptors. While these can cost as little as $2,000 each, they typically also require a human pilot and crew to successfully track, chase, and destroy a Shahed drone.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States accused Russia on Monday of a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation” of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace.\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia’s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, a NATO ally.\n\nShe told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the United States deplores “the staggering number of casualties” in the conflict and condemns Russia’s intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.\n\nUkraine called for the meeting after last Thursday’s overnight Russian bombardment with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, including the powerful, new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, which Moscow used for only the second time in what was a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe large-scale attack came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nThe attack also coincided with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. And it came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Russia.\n\nMoscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. And Russia's U.N. ambassador on Monday blamed the diplomatic impasse on Ukraine.\n\nEurope’s leaders condemned the attack using the Oreshnik as “escalatory and unacceptable,” and U.S. envoy Bruce was equally tough on Monday.\n\n“At a moment of tremendous potential, due only to President Trump’s unparalleled commitment to peace around the world, both sides should be seeking ways to de-escalate,” she said. “Yet Russia’s action risks expanding and intensifying the war.”\n\nBruce reminded Russia that nearly a year ago it voted in favor of a Security Council resolution calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It would be nice if Russia matched their words with deeds,” she said. “In the spirit of that resolution, Russia, Ukraine and Europe must pursue peace seriously and bring this nightmare to an end.”\n\nBut Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council that until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “comes to his senses and agrees to realistic conditions for negotiations, we will continue solving the problem by military means.”\n\n“He was warned long ago, with each passing day, each day which he squanders, the conditions for negotiations will only get worse for him,” Nebenzia said. “Similarly, each vile attack on Russian civilians will elicit a stiff response.”\n\nUkraine’s U.N. Ambassador Andriy Melnyk countered that Russia is more vulnerable now than at any time since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Its economy is slowing and oil revenue is down.\n\n“Russia wants to sell to this council and the whole U.N. family the impression that it is invincible, but this is another illusion,” he told the council. “The carefully staged image of strength is nothing but smoke and mirrors, completely detached from reality.”",

    "description": "Injuries in Ukraine largely come from shrapnel and explosions. Medics say they're seeing damage to multiple parts of the body all at once.",
    "fullText": "The war in Ukraine is one of blast and shrapnel injuries, not gunshot wounds, a local medic and US veterans providing medical care in front-line areas told Business Insider.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine is characterized by fighting in extensive trench networks, where grenades continue to prove their worth, intense artillery fire, missile barrages, and drone attacks. Land mines also continue to be a problem.\n\nGunfights, however, are becoming less common.\n\nUS veterans and a Ukrainian medic told Business Insider that most combat injuries are caused by fragmentation and burns and that amputations are often necessary.\n\nThese injuries are not unusual for industrial, artillery-heavy conflicts, or more modern kinds of warfare, for that matter, but they are being exacerbated by new technology, such as exploding one-way attack drones and others that drop grenades and other deadly explosives.\n\n\"This is not a war of direct small-arms contact,\" the medic shared, \"but a war of remote destruction.\"\n\nKaterina Zirka, the Ukrainian combat medic, said that she increasingly sees injuries that affect multiple parts of the body at once, often without a single identifiable \"entry wound,\" but instead dozens of micro-injuries from blasts and shrapnel. The medical equipment she carries has changed as a result.\n\nMedics are also seeing internal blast injuries that don't come with external wounds, such as concussions, ruptured eardrums, and lung injuries from rapid changes in pressure, she said.\n\nSoldiers fighting in Ukraine have told Business Insider about being injured by exploding drones, mines, and falling debris when buildings are hit. Mortars, artillery, and rockets have also done their fair share of damage.\n\nA US veteran who fought in Ukraine and served as a combat medic for his unit previously told Business Insider that he saw a significant number of injuries from explosions, like burns, concussions, traumatic brain injuries, and wounds from shrapnel that resulted in amputations.\n\n\"Artillery is fucking everywhere out there. You go anywhere near the front, it's just artillery shell, artillery shell, artillery artillery,\" he said, speaking to BI on the condition of anonymity for operational security reasons.\n\nThe threats, however, are far more than artillery.\n\nJeffrey Wells, a US Navy veteran with experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, is involved in medical training for front-line Ukrainian civilians through a nonprofit organization, Task Force Antal, that also provides supplies and evacuation assistance. He shared details about the kinds of injuries he's seen in this role.\n\n\"Mostly people aren't being shot, even on the front lines,\" he explained. \"It's injuries that come from a missile, a drone, or a glide bomb.\"\n\nMark Antal, the co-founder of Task Force Antal and a veteran of the elite US special operations unit Delta Force, told Business Insider that he had to tell some of his group's medics that \"the soldiers on the front line, less than 2% of them are being shot. All of the wounds are from drones, from shrapnel.\"\n\nAnd with civilians, \"it's crush injuries, it's blast injuries.\"\n\nChristine Quinn Antal, a US Army veteran and former national security advisor who co-founded the nonprofit, said that with other injuries being significantly more prevalent, members have taken \"things like chest seals,\" tools used for gunshot wounds, out of their medical kits. \"We've moved away from that,\" she said.\n\nAway from the cities, out on the front lines, drones dominate warfare, but even in the close-quarters fighting, explosives, not necessarily guns, are key. There is still a role for guns in this war, but drones and other new tech are taking over classic combat roles, even the precision strike role of snipers.\n\nDrones are used in this war more than in any other conflict in history, and have fundamentally changed the shape of the war. Their ubiquity is shown by Ukraine's own stats. Its commander in chief said in November that drones were responsible for around 60% of all Russian targets hit.\n\nDrones direct traditional weapons but also engage targets as well. They are deadly tools readily available in large quantities at low costs, making them increasingly desirable tools as the war drags on.\n\nZirka said that injuries have changed because now, \"most engagements actually take place in the air through the use of drones. As a result, gunshot wounds are encountered much less frequently.\" Soldiers have told BI that drones have created a roughly 10-kilometer kill zone at the front.\n\nGuns are not gone from Ukraine, far from it, but it is a different kind of fighting. Soldiers carry and are trained on various guns for different missions, some of which sometimes actually lead to injuries that aren't gunshots.\n\nSoldiers often arm themselves against the ever-present threat of drones with electronic warfare tools and shotguns, among other systems. Shooting down drones, like the fiber-optic drones resistant to jamming, can generate dangerous shrapnel that can pierce or shred the skin.\n\nTroops also carry guns into trench warfare, which has been a prominent part of this fight.\n\nBut much of that fight also relies on other weapons, such as explosives like grenades and mines. These weapons are used to booby trap trenches and to try to clear them. The trenches can be so tight that it can make using firearms like assault rifles difficult.\n\nDrones are also used in trench battles, including by dropping grenades into enemy trenches or diving down on soldiers and exploding.\n\nLikewise, explosives are often used to clear bunkers as well. Charging into one for an extremely close-quarters firefight is exceptionally dangerous. A grenade, on the other hand, lowers the risk.\n\nUkraine has mounted machine guns and other weapons on its uncrewed ground robots, creating new ways to fire on the Russians using guns without putting its troops at risk, but these weapons are still quite limited for the time being. The same is true for the automated gun turrets.\n\nAs Zirka indicated, this war is more of a remote-explosive fight than a gunfight.",

    "description": "Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, a commander of a drone team, told Business Insider what it was like flying in the heavy fog that Russia used to its advantage.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, an ISR drone team leader in Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces. He deployed in 2025 near Pokrovsk, a key city that Russia said it captured in early December.\n\nBusiness Insider has verified his role in the Ukrainian armed forces. The article has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore the full-scale war, I was a software engineer, working for companies in San Francisco, New Zealand, and Germany.\n\nToday, I lead a team of five to six Ukrainian drone operators. Our task is to use high-flying drones to provide reconnaissance data to our troops and commanders.\n\nWith our intelligence, artillery such as HIMARS and drone strike teams can target Russian equipment and soldiers, often before they can even reach the front lines.\n\nWe were redeployed to the Pokrovsk area in August because the fighting there had become so intense. Because drone operators are priority targets in the war, we would spend our dayslong rotations in houses and underground bunkers outside the city.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the weather was sunny and ideal for flying.\n\nBut the end of October was a disaster for us. Ukraine turns foggy in the autumn, with thick and low clouds that can stack from 100 meters to 300 meters above the ground.\n\nThese are so thick that no infrared camera or thermal camera can see through them, and caused many days to be completely no-go for flying for our types of drones.\n\nAt the time, the Russians took advantage of the clouds, using them to cover their advance on foot and in vehicles. Given the weather, the number of personnel they sacrificed to take the city, and our limited resources, there was eventually no viable way for us to defend Pokrovsk forever.\n\nUkraine is dependent on drone warfare. It has carried us through the terrible and scary times of these Russian assaults, and it has changed the face of war. For the entire summer of 2025, for example, I saw a tank only twice on the battlefield.\n\nDrones are cheap and effective, and if we had an infinite number of drones, we would have been working 24/7 to fight the Russians in Pokrovsk.\n\nBut we don't have infinite drones, so in the meantime, we need other strike tools and resources, such as more artillery fire and troops. War is complex, and drones cannot be its only solution.\n\nIn normal conditions, we fly our drones four times a day, with each flight lasting about three to four hours and sometimes into the night. It's tiring, but worth it, because you can make an enormous difference for Ukrainian defenders. We can spot where Russian forces are moving, denying them the element of surprise, and scout for assets such as air defenses and artillery for commanders to strike.\n\nRecon drone operators like us rely heavily on visual navigation. We study Pokrovsk so closely that, even when our drone is being spoofed, we can determine our flying location simply by the shape of the terrain or landmarks.\n\nWhen the foggy season comes, we try to make the most of any good visibility. Sometimes, you can get lucky and perform five flights in a five-day rotation.\n\nHowever, there were days when we found ourselves sitting in a house, just waiting for the weather to clear.\n\nYou can try to fly under the clouds, but going low means our bulky drones are more easily spotted and destroyed. Since we have limited tools, we try to preserve them and not use them recklessly.\n\nStill, on days with strong winds, there's a chance that the clouds may break slightly and give you glimpses of the battlefield. Sometimes, when visibility is bad but not impossible to work with, we must risk flying in such weather, especially if our troops are defending against a major assault.\n\nIn late summer, the situation in Pokrovsk was becoming increasingly problematic, both on the ground and in the sky. Back in the day, we would help long-range artillery focus on the Russian rear.\n\nI began to notice that Russia's tactics were making an impact around September.\n\nAcross the warzone, their strategy is to find our limit and overwhelm it with the smallest number of soldiers needed to seize our positions.\n\nIt is simple mathematics. Initially, they would send around 10 soldiers. If that wasn't enough, they would send 20. Then they would try 30.\n\nDay by day, they increase the number of troops and equipment. Their goal is to create a situation where we don't have enough drones to counter the amount of attacking infantry.\n\nTo eliminate an assault of 50 guys, all spread out, we'd need at least 150 drones and artillery, which is difficult for us to organize with our limited resources.\n\nWhen we were working in Pokrovsk, there were already areas of the city where the Russians had advanced, so the fighting area was porous and undefined.\n\nIf we had more troops, we could have held out for much longer and performed more aggressive maneuvers.\n\nIf we had more recon drones, our team could have flown over Pokrovsk nonstop, working despite the clouds.\n\nWith more first-person-view strike drones, our pilots could continue to find and attack the Russians closer to the ground.\n\nBut we don't have enough. So, we need other strike tools besides FPV drones, even though they account for about 80% of our kills on Russians.\n\nIronically, some of these tools have disappeared because warfare has changed so much. Mortars might have helped, but we mostly stopped using them — the battlefield is now so transparent that it is a suicide mission to ride around close to the front line in your pickup truck with a mortar.\n\nWhat we definitely need is artillery ammunition. Last year, some HIMARS units I worked with were rationed to four strikes a week.\n\nOther artillery units were limited to just three artillery shells a day. We would find them a target, and they would say: \"We don't have any more for today. Sorry, guys.\"\n\nThe weather in this season means it is still what drone pilots call our \"low season.\" At the same time, the terrain is now not too muddy, so it is the perfect time for Russians to attack.\n\nThis month, I am redeploying to Dnipro. The fight continues.",

    "description": "Ukraine said the \"Geran-5\" bears similarities to Iran's Karrar attack drone, and uses a more powerful engine than Russia's current turbojet Shaheds.",
    "fullText": "Russia has attacked Ukraine with a new type of long-range drone that uses a powerful jet engine to fly 600 miles with a 200-pound explosive warhead, Kyiv's military intelligence agency said.\n\nThe Ukrainian intelligence directorate, or GUR, released a statement on Sunday providing new details about what it dubbed the \"Geran-5.\"\n\nGUR said the drone was used during an attack in early 2026.\n\n\"Unlike previous modifications of the 'Geran' line, the device is made according to a normal aerodynamic scheme,\" GUR said, adding that the Geran-5 bears a strong resemblance to Iran's Karrar attack drone.\n\nPublished images showed wreckage of the apparent device on snow-laden ground, which included long fixed wings attached to a slender chassis. Business Insider could not independently verify the location and date of the images.\n\nThe Geran-5 is roughly 20 feet long, with a wingspan of about 18 feet, GUR added.\n\n\"The warhead weighs about 90 kg, and the declared range is about 1,000 km,\" the intelligence agency said.\n\nRussia's Geran drone family is most often associated with the Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munition. The Geran-1, Geran-2, and Geran-3 are inexpensive, mass-manufactured drones modeled after the Shahed but tweaked for production inside Russia.\n\nWhile the new drone's design differs significantly from that of the typical Shahed, GUR said it was being classified as a type of Geran because it shares many key components with Russian Shahed-like drones.\n\nThese include a jet engine made by Telefly, a Chinese company, and a microcomputer that GUR said is modeled after Raspberry Pi, a UK-designed low-cost computer that fits on a small board.\n\nThe Geran-3, a newer drone resembling Iran's Shahed-238, was earlier reported by Ukraine to use a Telefly JT80 turbojet engine that allows the device to fly at speeds of up to 230 miles per hour.\n\nGUR said the Telefly engine on the Geran-5 generates even more thrust, but did not give specifics about the drone's speed.\n\nUkrainian authorities have said that they've found Raspberry Pi 4 computers on Russia's more commonly used Geran-2s. These drones, modeled after the Shahed-136, are Russia's main tool in the hundreds-strong waves bombarding Ukraine and require computers for functions such as transmitting navigation data to operators.\n\nTelefly did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider. The Raspberry Pi Foundation did not respond to a similar request sent outside regular business hours.\n\nGUR said that the Geran-5 also uses 3G and 4G modems, as well as a 12-channel Comet, otherwise known as Kometa, satellite navigation system. The Kometa is typically known to use multiple antennas, which makes it more resistant to jamming.\n\n\"As with previous 'geraniums,' this UAV is difficult to consider as a Russian Federation development,\" GUR said.\n\nNotably, the intelligence agency said it had information that Russia is looking to launch the Geran-5 from another aircraft, such as the Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jet.\n\nUsing the drone in this way would likely greatly increase its operational range, since the Su-25 can fly out a distance before launching the Geran-5. Russia has typically been launching its older Gerans from ground-based ramps in Western Russia, annexed Crimea, and occupied Ukraine.\n\n\"Separately, the possibility of equipping the aircraft with R-73 air-to-air missiles to counter Ukrainian aviation is being considered,\" GUR said.\n\nThe R-73 is a Soviet-era heat-seeking missile, also known as the AA-11 Archer by NATO, designed to be fired from fighter jets to attack other aircraft.\n\nUkraine has previously said that it found Russia had mounted some of its Geran-2s with the R-60, an older air-to-air missile, to target aircraft such as helicopters trying to hunt down drones.",

Then Ukraine laughed at the so-called “hairy tank”, coated in long, wavy metal wires.\n\nNow the “dandelion tank” has arrived.\n\nMoscow’s latest crude design, which features flexible metal rods arranged in branched layers, attempts to shield the body of the tank from the ever-present threat of small kamikaze drones.\n\nIt may look ridiculous, but analysts say the Oduvanchik (dandelion) anti-drone armour might offer the best protection currently available for the expensive vehicles.\n\nIt is the latest in a series of odd-looking Russian inventions that have appeared over the past week, each inspiring some level of mockery online. They include a camouflage net disguised as rubble and a patent for giant rotating propellers to protect Soviet-era vans.\n\nBut in such a protracted and largely static war, which demands endless innovation at cheaper and cheaper costs, any edge may save lives at the front.\n\nThe unorthodox dandelion-inspired modification was pictured for the first time last week, covering a Russian T-90M tank inside a warehouse. It is unclear when it will be deployed for combat, but Russia’s defence ministry recently patented the design.\n\nThe reinforced metal rods are welded together to form a tree-like structure that branches out into several tiers, forming a three-dimensional barrier, like the florets of a dandelion. In any gaps, a high-strength mesh is stretched between them.\n\nIf an explosive-rigged FPV (first-person-view) drone flies towards the tank, the rods should detonate it at a distance, shielding the hull from most of the blast. For every extra inch the drone is kept away, the tank has a better chance of survival.\n\nOn top of a T-90’s significant base armour, Russia often adds explosive reactive armour and metal cages. Pair this with the dandelion defence and “you’ve got the best passive anti-drone protection currently available,” David Axe, a military correspondent, wrote on his blog, Trench Art.\n\nIt is an upgrade of the “hedgehog” armour, of thick broom-like bristles protruding from a vehicle’s side, used across the front by Russian forces last year, and later by the Ukrainians.\n\n“At the front, anything you can experiment with, all different kinds of spikes, chains, cages, or a mixture of all, that can save the lives of soldiers is worth doing,” said David Kirichenko, a Ukraine-Russia weapons expert.\n\n“Ukrainian soldiers once mocked the Russians for putting cages on their vehicles; now they are doing it too,” he told The Telegraph.\n\nUkrainian forces were pictured earlier this week showing off a new design on a large infantry fighting vehicle that featured dandelion-like anti-drone armour, hair-like bristles, and metal sheets hanging from chains.\n\n“It is a part of [the] endless development of experimental and wacky inventions by both sides,” said Mr Kirichenko. “There is a constant race to identify weaknesses, produce measures and countermeasures and adapt to changing battlefield conditions.”\n\nYet, as with many other anti-drone systems, there are drawbacks. All the extra gear adds to the vehicle’s weight, slowing it down and leaving it more exposed to the drones that haunt the front.\n\nPlus, the dandelion armour is far from impregnable. Ukraine is proving increasingly efficient at flying drones beneath tanks and vehicles to strike them from below, where the armour is weakest, or to use FPVs to drop mines in their path.\n\nValerii Riabykh, a Ukrainian weapons analyst and editor of Defence Express, also pointed out how such protection was “ineffective against traditional weapons, such as an artillery shell, especially a high-precision one.”\n\nBut when it comes to drones, he said: “It may be effective for some time until the opposing side picks up the key to this protection, or breaks it.”\n\nIt can disguise gun, artillery or infantry positions underneath a rug of fake smashed-up bricks that look like rubble and rubbish, hiding equipment from Ukrainian drone operators.\n\nMr Riabykh said that, like the dandelion tank, it would probably only be useful for a limited time.\n\nWith the rise of AI and image processing tools installed within drones, its specific features could automatically highlight the nets to drone operators, he said, becoming an “unmasking feature which will lead to even faster destruction of those who use them”.\n\nAnother rudimentary tactic that emerged last week is the use of large propellers mounted on the roof, front, rear and sides of civilian vehicles used at the front.\n\nShort on modern armoured vehicles, Russia has for two years been using vans, trucks and jeeps for front-line tasks. Such unprotected vehicles are easy targets for Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a Russian patent, when the drone attempts to attack a protected vehicle, “there is a high probability that he will enter the rotation zone of one of the blades”.\n\nAnalysts The Telegraph spoke to largely dismissed such a design, owing to how much of the van is exposed and the fact that the propellers probably cost more than the vehicle they are intended to protect.\n\nYet any modifications, no matter how seemingly trivial, could allow either side to buy time, said Mr Riabykh, “and time on the modern battlefield is everything”.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Russia said Friday it used its latest missile against Ukraine for a second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, a forceful signal to Kyiv and its Western allies as U.S.-led peace talks have entered a new and crucial stage.\n\nThe hypersonic Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile hit Ukraine's western Lviv region late Thursday night, although officials there did not mention any casualties. The area is near a military base in neighboring Poland, a NATO member, that serves as a key hub for ferrying Western military supplies to Kyiv.\n\nSome Moscow commentators said the attack was a warning to European leaders against proposals to deploy their troops to Ukraine as part of a prospective peace deal. Russia has said it won't accept such a deployment and would view those forces as legitimate targets.\n\nA look at the weapon and why Russia used it now:\n\nWhat’s known about the Oreshnik\n\nRussia first used the multiple-warhead Oreshnik on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in November 2024.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said the Oreshnik, which means “hazelnut tree” in Russian, streaks at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, “like a meteorite,” and was immune to any missile defense system.\n\nHe said the weapon is so powerful that several such missiles -- even fitted with conventional warheads — could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. He said it’s capable of destroying underground bunkers “three, four or more floors down.”\n\nThe Russian military said the Oreshnik can carry nuclear or conventional warheads and can reach any European target.\n\nThe Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019.\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Ukraine’s military said the missile had six independently targetable warheads, each carrying six submunitions.\n\nRussian military bloggers said the submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives.\n\nSince the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has used swarms of cheap slow-flying drones and an assortment of other missiles, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said last month the Oreshnik had been deployed to Belarus and entered active service. It didn't specify how many missiles were sent to the key ally of Moscow and whether they were fitted with nuclear warheads, but Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that up to 10 Oreshnik systems will be stationed there.\n\nRussia previously has stationed tactical nuclear weapons inside Belarus, whose territory it used to launch the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2024, Putin released a revised nuclear doctrine that placed Belarus under Russia's atomic umbrella. The document significantly lowered the threshold for the possible use of nuclear weapons, declaring that any nation’s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on the country. The threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons.\n\nUnlike Russia's other shorter-range conventional weapons, the Oreshnik is able to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether the missile is carrying a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target.\n\nRussia's message by using the Oreshnik\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Putin described it as a response to Ukraine's Western allies allowing it to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory.\n\nIts latest strike comes as the U.S.-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine have entered a pivotal stage and appears to underline Putin’s intention to negotiate from a position of strength as his troops make slow but steady territorial gains.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers noted that the strike in Lviv, not far from the Polish border, was a message intended for Kyiv’s allies. Those members of the “coalition of the willing” have proposed sending their troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees once a peace deal is reached.\n\nRussia has said it won't accept any European forces in Ukraine, seeing them as legitimate targets.\n\n“For the first time, NATO command has been shown a strategic weapons strike virtually on its border,” said military expert Valery Shiryayev. “This action is intended to demonstrate the determination of Russia’s military and political leadership to use such weapons with nuclear warheads if necessary.”\n\nThe attack comes less than a week after the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a Russian ally. The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the U.S. action as an act of aggression and sharply criticized Wednesday’s U.S. seizure of a Russia-flagged tanker.",

    "description": "President Vladimir Putin's launch of an Oreshnik hypersonic missile appears aimed at intimidating Ukraine and sending a signal of Russian military might to Europe and the United States at a crucial juncture in talks to end the war. Putin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024.",
    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's launch of an Oreshnik hypersonic missile appears aimed at intimidating Ukraine and sending a signal of Russian military might to Europe and the United States at a crucial juncture in talks to end the war.\n\nPutin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024. Since then, it has kept the weapon in reserve.\n\nThe overnight Oreshnik strike in western Ukraine came after a week of setbacks for Russia. ‌On Saturday, President Donald Trump sent U.S. special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close Putin ally, and on Wednesday U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the north Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain and France announced plans to deploy troops in Ukraine ‌in the event of a ceasefire - prompting Moscow to respond that it would view foreign soldiers as legitimate combat targets.\n\nGerhard Mangott, a Russia specialist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said Moscow was frustrated at being sidelined during weeks of diplomacy between the U.S., Ukraine and the Europeans, and \"particularly mad\" about the planned potential troop deployment by Kyiv's European allies. The use of the Oreshnik should be seen in that context, he said.\n\n\"It's a signal to the United States and the Europeans about the military capabilities of the Russian army,\" Mangott said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe said Moscow wanted to convey that \"Russia is to be taken seriously, given its military arsenal, ⁠and that the Europeans and Trump should return to a minimum of respect ‌for the Russian position in the negotiations.\"\n\n'DESTRUCTION NOT NECESSARILY THE GOAL'\n\nThe Oreshnik is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, although there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the latest attack.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the missile struck a state enterprise in the western city of Lviv and ‍was likely carrying inert or \"dummy\" warheads - as in 2024, when Russia first fired it to test the weapon in war.\n\n\"It does appear that at this point Russia is using Oreshnik for signaling purposes, so the destruction is not necessarily the goal,\" Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, told Reuters when asked if the use of dummy warheads would diminish the capacity of Moscow's action to intimidate Ukraine and its allies.\n\n\"It's probably a general signal of resolve ​to escalate. My guess is that it will be read this way by the West,\" he said.\n\nWestern reaction to the attack, around 60 km (40 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland, was swift. ‌The leaders of Britain, France and Germany called it \"escalatory and unacceptable\". European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"a clear escalation against Ukraine and meant as a warning to Europe and to the U.S.\".\n\nRUSSIAN STATEMENT ON REASON FOR MISSILE USE DRAWS SCEPTICISM\n\nRussia specialist Mangott was sceptical about the official statement from Russia's Defence Ministry that the Oreshnik launch was in response to an alleged Ukraine drone strike targeting one of Putin's residences, in the northern region of Novgorod, late last month. Ukraine has denied any such attack took place, accusing Moscow of lying about it in order to derail peace talks.\n\nSeveral high-profile Russian war bloggers also criticised the official framing of the strike as a revenge attack. One, Yuri Baranchik, suggested it would have \"looked more convincing\" if Moscow had fired the missile at President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's bunker in Kyiv.\n\nMick Ryan, ⁠an Australian military expert, linked the weapon's use to Russia's recent setbacks, especially over Venezuela.\n\nHe said the point was \"to demonstrate ​that Russia remains a nuclear-armed world power. In this guise, it is a psychological weapon – an instrument of Putin’s cognitive war ​against Ukraine and the West – rather than a weapon of mass physical destruction.\"\n\nRussian arch-hawk Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Putin's Security Council, alluded in a social media post to the capture of Maduro, the oil tanker seizure by the U.S. and the possibility of further U.S. sanctions against Russia, which he ‍said had made for a \"stormy\" start to the year.\n\nIn ⁠comments highly critical of Washington, he said international relations had descended into a madhouse and compared the Oreshnik strike to \"a life-saving injection of haloperidol\", an anti-psychotic drug.\n\nProminent Russian war blogger Fighterbomber, a former military serviceman, said he thought the use of the Oreshnik was a display of power to convey a message and that Moscow would not be resorting to it often.\n\nHe noted that ⁠some Oreshnik systems had been transferred to Belarus and that Russia would have some of its own in reserve, but suggested that there was not an endless supply of the relatively new missile.\n\n\"Taking all these constants into account, we can assume that ‌we can afford to conduct such demonstrations two or three times a year,\" he wrote.\n\nHe expressed hope that no further launches would be needed for now, concluding: \"The signals have ‌been sent and they have been heard.\"",

    "description": "Ukrainian cities have set up hundreds of \"invincibility points\" in preparation for a rare mass blackout event like this week's.",
    "fullText": "A new wave of Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure has put two of its biggest regions to the test, as local cities rolled out plans for dealing with their worst blackouts in years.\n\nTheir prepared \"blackout mode\" response provides some insight into how urban centers might steel themselves for energy crises in wartime, especially during cold months. Ukraine's winter can turn brutal in January and February, when temperatures typically drop to 18°F.\n\nMass blackouts can also disrupt water and sewage systems, hospitals, public transportation, and road control, including traffic lights.\n\nBoth Ukrainian troops and civilians have long learned to cope with frequent energy shortages in the winter, maintaining backup generators, battery-powered lamps, and stockpiles of coal or gas.\n\nBut Moscow's latest attacks on Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk, two eastern Ukrainian regions, plunged both areas into almost total darkness this week.\n\nRegional leaders have described it as their biggest energy crisis since 2022, when Ukrainians first faced wartime power outages. Borys Filatov, the mayor of Dnipro, Dnipropetrovsk's largest city, said the situation there was one of the most severe in the country and had risen to the level of a \"national emergency.\"\n\n\"This is the first total blackout in the entire region in recent years,\" Ivan Fedorov, Zaporizhzhia's governor, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nAs national authorities reported that over 1 million people had lost heat and water, local officials rushed to restore power and open access to facilities prearranged for the blackouts.\n\nOne of their prepared responses was to deploy \"invincibility points,\" or earmarked emergency shelters equipped with heat, communication, and basic necessities.\n\nSome local governments publish a map with available locations for civilians. The city of Dnipro, for example, maintains a list of mostly schools, municipality buildings, and metro stations designated as safe spots.\n\nCivilians are meant to visit these shelters to \"warm up, charge your gadgets, and wait out the power outage,\" per the municipal government.\n\nA video published by Oleksy Kuleba, Ukraine's vice prime minister for reconstruction and the minister for community and territorial development, showed one point in Dnipropetrovsk that appears to be located in a small convenience store.\n\nKuleba said the region's energy sector had been hit with a \"massive blow,\" and that over 5,000 people visited 500 such locations in the city of Dnipro within 24 hours after the power outages began.\n\nKuleba added that neighboring regions in Ukraine had donated 45 generators to Dnipropetrovsk, where some of its trains had switched to burning onboard fuel for power.\n\nZaporizhzhia's governor, Fedorov, also said on Thursday that the region had 400 established invincibility points, with 200 ready for visitors within two hours.\n\n\"Residents could warm up, call their relatives, drink hot tea, and, if necessary, stay overnight,\" he said.\n\nFilatov, Dnipro's mayor, said on Thursday that the city had set up 130 water dispensers, which his staff marked on Google Maps, and that disrupted public transport would be temporarily replaced by buses.\n\nHospitals were already equipped with alternative power sources and necessities, while parts of the city, on the western bank of the Dnipro River, were supported by backup power, he added.\n\n\"The city's sewage system is also powered,\" Filatov said.\n\nNotably, Filatov said that while authorities had extended local school holidays to January 11, kindergartens would operate on four-hour shifts \"because it's clear that parents are also in a difficult situation.\"\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, Fedorov said the region had been left \"completely without electricity\" on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We immediately went into 'blackout' mode and started working according to a clear plan,\" he said.\n\nZaporizhzhia's hospitals similarly switched to backup power within minutes, and the region's traffic lights \"worked autonomously,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian officials have since said that power has been partially returned to both regions, with Kuleba reporting on late Thursday evening that water and heating in Dnipropetrovsk had been restored to over 1.7 million people and 270,000 people, respectively.\n\nEnergy supplier DTEK said that around 700,000 families in the Dnipropetrovsk region once again had access to electricity, though it added that Russian bombing was continuing.\n\n\"An exhausting day for energy workers in the Dnipropetrovsk region,\" the company said.\n\nFedorov warned repeatedly on Thursday evening of incoming drone and guided missile strikes over Zaporizhzhia. He later said that Russia had carried out over 728 strikes, including drone attacks, artillery shelling, and multiple-launch rocket system strikes across Ukraine that day.\n\nBoth Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk are close to the southern and eastern front lines in Ukraine.\n\nKyiv has often accused Russia of specifically targeting energy infrastructure during the winter to exhaust and punish Ukrainian civilians, which is a war crime but is often difficult to prove.\n\nThe Kremlin has often responded that its strikes were intended for legitimate military targets, though the years have shown that critical facilities are regularly damaged or destroyed by the attacks.\n\n\"There is no military sense in such strikes on the energy sector, on infrastructure, which leave people without electricity and heating in winter conditions,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday.",

    "description": "Ukraine's commander in chief said December was the first month that its drones \"neutralized\" roughly as many Russians as were called up.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's top general said that for the first time in the war, its drones are killing or seriously wounding Russia's soldiers as fast as it can get new troops into the field.\n\nDrones are the top battlefield threat, responsible for the most casualties in this war. Ukraine relies heavily on them, especially the cheap first-person-view drones, as solutions to its manpower and equipment shortages.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Tuesday in a Telegram post that December was the first month in which Ukraine's uncrewed systems units \"neutralized\" about as many Russian servicemen as it called up in a month.\n\nHe said video confirmed 33,000 Russian losses last month. \"The real losses of the occupiers are greater,\" the general said.\n\nSyrskyi did not provide a number for the number of Russian soldiers called up. Business Insider is unable to independently confirm Syrskyi's claims.\n\nRussia hasn't provided official casualty figures. As for the number of new Russian soldiers sent to Ukraine each month, a US assessment put the number around 30,000 last April. In May, however, the Russian president said that the number was twice that. A Ukrainian intelligence assessment in December said that Russia fulfilled its 2025 mobilization target of 403,000, an average of more than 36,000 a month.\n\nRussia's armed forces in Ukraine are a mixed bag of contract soldiers who volunteer for the fight — Russia attracts volunteers with various perks, like signing bonuses — conscripts pulled in through draft cycles, and other sources. Russia has previously recruited people out of its prisons.\n\nThough exact losses are unclear, Ukrainian and Western intel assessments point to substantial attrition. Russia has a much larger population to draw soldiers from than Ukraine, which is also said to have suffered significant losses in this war. Some estimates put Russian losses at 1,000 troops a day.\n\nWhile Russia has a larger population to pull from, it has tried to avoid repeated large-scale involuntary mobilizations.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin publicly promised not to send conscripts to the front lines, fearing fallout. It has limited what Russia can do with them, even though widespread reporting and captured conscripts say assurances have been misleading.\n\nSyrskyi called 2025 a great breakthrough for Ukraine's drone war and pledged that it would not stop, with plans to grow capabilities further in 2026.\n\nHe said that in December, the number of targets that were hit or destroyed by drones rose by 31% and that the number of Russian personnel hit rose by more than 25%.\n\nSyrskyi said in November that uncrewed systems were responsible for about 60 % of all enemy targets hit. That figure has also been higher, at times, in front-line areas.\n\nDrones directly attack troops and equipment — either by carrying explosives or dropping weapons like grenades — and they also collect intelligence that shapes how armies employ other forces. Even inexpensive drones have had an outsized impact, destroying sophisticated, multimillion-dollar systems such as tanks.\n\nRussia and Ukraine are locked in a drone development race to field greater numbers and more advanced drones, as well as counter-drone technology.\n\nSyrskyi warned that Russia also has ambitious plans for its drones. He said that Russia copied Ukraine by creating a separate part of the military for uncrewed systems and said that it has 80,000 servicemen. He said Russia plans to expand that to 165,500 this year and to almost 210,000 by 2030.\n\nThere are so many drones in the sky that Ukrainian soldiers previously told Business Insider that they were sometimes unable to tell which side any belonged to and would instead try to bring them all down just to be on the safe side.",

    "fullText": "The lightning U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro can be seen as both a benefit and a burden for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose forces botched an attempt to capture Ukraine’s capital and topple its leader at the start of Moscow's invasion nearly four years ago.\n\nThe ouster of Maduro highlights another Kremlin failure to support an ally, following the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024 and last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran. With the U.S. determined to establish control over Venezuela, Russia stands to lose a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere, along with billions of dollars invested in its oil industry.\n\nBut President Donald Trump's actions in Venezuela also are causing unease in Western nations and giving the Kremlin fresh talking points to defend its war in Ukraine.\n\nIn addition, Trump’s interest in wresting control of Greenland from NATO ally Denmark also threatens to destabilize the alliance at the moment when the U.S.-led efforts to broker peace in Ukraine enter a pivotal stage, distracting its members from their efforts to support Kyiv and provide it with security guarantees.\n\nPutin himself hasn’t commented on the U.S. actions in Venezuela, which his diplomats have denounced as a blatant act of aggression. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president who serves as his deputy on the presidential Security Council, similarly rebuked Washington for trampling international law — but also complimented Trump on defending U.S. interests.\n\n“Even though Trump’s action is completely unlawful, he cannot be denied a certain consistency — he and his team are very aggressively upholding their country’s national interests,” Medvedev said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. said it seized two sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela, including one flagged to Russia in the North Atlantic.\n\nMoscow's ‘spheres of influence’\n\nSince 2014's illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that followed the ouster of a pro-Kremlin president in Kyiv, Putin has sought to justify his action by describing his neighbor as part of Russia’s sphere of influence where Western encroachment can’t be allowed.\n\nPutin has argued that just as the U.S. would bristle at any foreign military presence in the Western Hemisphere, Russia sees NATO’s expansion to its borders as a major security threat. He cited Ukraine’s bid to join the military alliance as a key reason behind his full-scale invasion of the country.\n\n“We have made it clear and unambiguous that further eastward expansion of NATO is unacceptable,” Putin said shortly before sending troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. “Are we the ones placing missiles near the U.S. borders? No, it’s the U.S. that has brought its missiles to our doorstep.”\n\nLong before the invasion, Russia tested the ground on a possible deal under which it would refrain from meddling in Latin America in exchange for the U.S. offering Moscow free rein in Europe.\n\nFiona Hill, who oversaw Russia and Europe on Trump's National Security Council during his first term, testified before Congress in 2019 that the Russians were signaling their willingness to make such an arrangement involving Venezuela and Ukraine.\n\nRussia never made a formal offer, Hill told The Associated Press in an interview, but Moscow’s then-ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, “hinted ... many times” to her that Russia could cede its influence in Venezuela to the U.S. in exchange for a sphere of influence in Europe.\n\nShe said Trump's administration wasn’t interested in the Russian overtures that she described as a “hint-hint, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, how-about-doing-a-deal” offer. In April 2019, Hill was sent to Moscow to convey the message that “nobody’s interested. ... Ukraine and Venezuela are not related to each other.”\n\nHill said she did not know if the winds have now changed and whether there was any deal between the U.S. and Russia to swap spheres of influence in Venezuela and Ukraine, but she noted that many officials, including herself, who were involved in “restraining” Trump in his first term aren't around for his second.\n\nShe argued that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio would likely be the only member of the Trump administration who would now resist such a proposal, but added that others, including Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, could have a different view.\n\n“Who knows what Witkoff and others have been chatting about recently?” Hill asked.\n\nBefore Maduro was captured, AP reported Russia had started evacuating families of diplomats from Venezuela. When asked about the move, Hill said it would not be “implausible” that Witkoff gave Moscow a “courtesy heads-up.”\n\nSam Greene, a Russia expert at King’s College London, observed that Moscow may have backed down on Venezuela in the expectation of the U.S. giving it a free hand on Ukraine.\n\n“My worry is that it may be part of a tacit agreement, by which Washington, Moscow and Beijing agree not to deter one another against interventions in their putative spheres of influence,” he wrote on X.\n\nRussia’s foothold in Western Hemisphere\n\nBefore the invasion of Ukraine, senior Russian officials had issued vague warnings that Moscow could deploy troops or military assets to Cuba and Venezuela — statements that the U.S. dismissed as bluster. Some drew parallels to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis — when the Soviet Union deployed missiles to Cuba and the U.S. imposed a naval blockade of the island.\n\nRussian-Cuban ties withered after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, plunging Cuba into a grueling depression. Soon after his first election in 2000, Putin ordered the closure of a Soviet-built military surveillance facility in Cuba as he sought to improve ties with Washington. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies mounted, however, Moscow again intensified trade and other contacts with Cuba and sent warships to visit the island.\n\nRussia also has invested heavily in Venezuela's oil industry, as did China, and offered Caracas generous loans to purchase top-of-the-line air defense missiles, fighter jets and other weapons. On several occasions, most recently in 2018, it dispatched its nuclear-capable Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela in a projection of force.\n\nMilitary experts have said, however, that any attempt by Russia to establish a permanent military foothold in the Western Hemisphere would face overwhelming logistical challenges.\n\nThe ‘might-makes-right’ doctrine\n\nThe U.S. seizure of Maduro and his wife was seen worldwide as the return of the “might- makes-right” doctrine, backing Moscow’s argument that its action in Ukraine protects its vital interests the way the U.S. did in Venezuela.\n\nAfter its action in Venezuela, the U.S. has “nothing to formally reproach our country for,” Medvedev noted.\n\nHill noted that Maduro’s capture makes it harder for countries to condemn Russia’s action in Ukraine because “we’ve just had a situation where the U.S. has taken over — or at least decapitated the government of another country — using fiction.”\n\nAn indictment accuses Maduro and others of working with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S.\n\nFyodor Lukyanov, a Kremlin-connected, Moscow-based foreign policy expert, observed that “if we consider what’s happening from the perspective of setting a precedent, then we couldn’t ask for anything better, and this includes Trump’s conviction that the authorities in Venezuela must be approved by Washington.”\n\nRussian hawks, meanwhile, argue the U.S. action in Venezuela has created a new sense of urgency for Moscow to dramatically speed up its offensive in Ukraine.\n\n“Ukraine under our full control is our pass to the Great Powers club,” Alexander Dugin, a hard-line nationalist ideologue, wrote in a commentary.\n\nAP European Security Correspondent Emma Burrows in London contributed.",

    "description": "A Ukrainian F-16 pilot said the initial tactics taught by NATO were based on wars that were \"fundamentally different\" from Ukraine's fight.",
    "fullText": "One of Ukraine's first F-16 pilots said they had to create new tactics for the fighter because the West's original training didn't fit the war against Russia.\n\nUkraine's air force released a video interview on Monday with the pilot, whose name wasn't disclosed, in which he spoke about the F-16 Fighting Falcon's performance and the early challenges he faced when learning to fly the aircraft.\n\nThe pilot said he flew Kyiv's Soviet-made combat aircraft in the initial days of Russia's full-scale invasion, before being sent abroad to train to fly the F-16s donated by the West.\n\nOnce he returned to the war, he and his fellow pilots \"encountered reality,\" he said.\n\n\"The tactics that we were taught abroad do not entirely fit the war we have here, because those tactics are also based on wars in which the partners previously took part,\" the pilot said. \"And this war is fundamentally different from those wars.\"\n\nUkrainian pilots had to devise their own tactics, he said.\n\n\"How we would destroy cruise missiles, strike drones, how we would fight with the enemy near the line of combat contact,\" the pilot added.\n\nUkraine's Western allies have been taking note of some of those lessons, he added.\n\n\"When the partners see our effectiveness, they understand how, in our limited conditions, we are able to carry out flights with such effectiveness,\" he said. \"And they even, I would say, learn from us. They learn the tactics and adjust the tactics that they taught us when we were abroad.\"\n\nThe pilot didn't go into exact detail about the types of new tactics Ukrainians developed for the F-16, but spoke about a daring maneuver he recently conducted in the Donbas region.\n\nHe said his three-ship formation had encountered heavily saturated Russian defenses, including surface-to-air missile systems and unspecified air assets, that \"did not allow us the possibility to approach\" their target.\n\n\"We drew two missiles from the enemy, because there were two launches from different directions, and we gave the opportunity for our strike aircraft to destroy the target,\" he said.\n\nThe pilot said the entire group returned safely after the mission.\n\nUkraine has officially received 44 of the 87 F-16s that European nations have promised to donate to Kyiv. Its first crews for the American-made aircraft were trained in Romania, where a coalition of NATO member states, including the US, worked to teach Ukrainian pilots, technicians, and other staff to service and fly the planes.\n\nIn his interview, the pilot said the language barrier was one of his biggest challenges when learning to fly the F-16, and that while waiting to be sent abroad for training, he studied English grammar, colloquial language, and aviation terms as he rested between combat flights.\n\n\"It was very hard, because after a combat sortie, as a rule, a pilot has to rest, because he does not know whether at some moment he might fly again,\" he said.\n\nThe first of Ukraine's F-16s entered the war in August 2024 and were primarily used for defensive purposes against strike drones and cruise missiles.\n\nKyiv has since lost four of the aircraft, but its pilots have also been recorded achieving notable feats, including one reportedly destroying six missiles in a single flight.\n\nThe interviewed pilot praised the F-16 as a fighter that performs \"flawlessly,\" but also said he wished for the more advanced, Block 70/72 version of the aircraft. These latest iterations have been upgraded with fifth-generation technology, including powerful radars with stronger jamming resistance and a modernized cockpit.\n\n\"If we were given such an opportunity to carry out tasks on these aircraft, I think that in our tally there would be not only destroyed strike drones and cruise missiles, but also enemy aircraft that are carrying out tasks along the line of combat contact,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is now on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Moscow as his administration continues to negotiate a deal to end the war that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he met with Trump at the White House earlier Wednesday, during which the president “greenlit” the Russia sanctions bill that has been in the works for months.\n\nGraham had signaled previously that Trump has blessed the bill, only for it to encounter additional obstacles. But a White House official confirmed to The Associated Press Wednesday that the president supports the sanctions legislation.\n\n“This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent,” Graham said in a statement, referring to the Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe bill, chiefly written by Graham and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., allows the administration to impose tariffs and secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russia’s oil, gas, uranium and other exports. Doing so is meant to cut off the source of financing for much of Russia’s military actions.\n\nThe White House has previously insisted on some revisions and flexibility for Trump in the sanctions package, but the White House official on Wednesday did not elaborate on whether any changes were secured.\n\nThe legislation has dozens of co-sponsors in the Senate, as well as a companion bill in the House, drafted by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.\n\nGraham said there could be a vote as early as next week, although it’s unclear how likely that will be. The Senate is poised to take up a scaled-back government funding package next week that the House is currently considering, if the House passes it. The following week is a Senate recess timed to Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently trying to finalize a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, now nearly four years old, with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, as the U.S. president’s chief negotiators.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range, deep-strike drones to hit a Russian missile arsenal and oil depot supporting the invasion, a security official told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe attacks mark Ukraine's latest deep strikes as it continues to target Russian weapons and the country's vast energy sector, a major revenue source for the state as it wages war.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, said that drones hit Russia's 100th Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU) in the western Kostroma region. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe drone attack on the facility triggered a secondary detonation of ammunition, causing powerful blasts at the facility, the source said, calling it an important target because Russia uses it to supply munitions to smaller sites in other areas of the country.\n\nThe source said drones also struck an oil depot in the nearby Lipetsk region, sparking an \"intense\" blaze. Video footage and images shared on social media appeared to show fire and smoke at the two facilities.\n\nOvernight, Ukrainian attack drones successfully hit a Russian oil depot in the town of Usman, Lipetsk Oblast. Seen here, flames leap into the night sky from the burning facility. pic.twitter.com/EN6SRI2sXU\n\nRussia's defense ministry said on Tuesday that it shot down 360 Ukrainian drones without specifying where. Neither the ministry nor the Russian embassy in the US responded to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe SBU source said that the two drone attacks were carried out by its Alpha group, an elite \"spetsnaz\" unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces.\n\nThe Alpha group regularly carries out long-range drone attacks against Russian targets, including a recent first-of-its-kind strike on a Moscow-linked oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea and the stunning June attacks against Russian airbases, known as Operation Spiderweb.\n\nThe SBU's Alpha forces also carry out ground operations; for instance, they have participated in Ukraine's defense of Pokrovsk, the war-torn city in the eastern Donetsk region that has been the site of some of the conflict's most intense fighting.\n\n\"In the New Year, the SBU continues to work successfully on military and oil facilities of the Russian Federation, reducing the enemy's ability to provide their army with ammunition and fuel,\" the source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\n\"All Russian rear facilities that work for the war against Ukraine are absolutely legitimate targets,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drones to attack Russian energy facilities in a bid to put pressure on a key source of revenue for Moscow that helps fuel its war efforts.\n\nUkraine has mostly targeted oil and gas infrastructure on land, such as depots and ports, but in recent weeks, it has expanded attacks to maritime targets, striking several oil tankers and oil platforms in the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the deep-strike operations as the country's way of imposing \"long-range\" sanctions on Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday's attack on the 100th GRAU arsenal reflects a tactic that Ukraine has long relied on — hitting ammunition storage sites inside Russia to cause more near-term battlefield impacts.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy replaced the head of his powerful security agency on Monday, pressing ahead with a reshuffle of top officials as Russia's war in Ukraine nears the four-year mark with ​no end in sight despite intense diplomacy.\n\nThe removal of Vasyl Maliuk, who oversaw a series of assassinations and a surprise ‌operation codenamed \"Spiderweb\" that destroyed Russian warplanes, shakes up the leadership of a vast security agency at the heart of Ukraine's shadow war.\n\nZelenskiy named Major-General Yevhenii Khmara as the acting ‌head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), which Maliuk had run since 2022. The agency described Khmara as an experienced commander who had served in the elite Alfa combat unit since 2011 and led it since 2023.\n\nSOME COMMANDERS STAND BY MALIUK\n\nZelenskiy said on X he had asked Maliuk to focus on combat operations, adding: \"There must be more Ukrainian asymmetric operations against the occupier and the Russian state, and more solid results in eliminating the enemy.\"\n\nZelenskiy ⁠last week named military spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as ‌his chief of staff to replace Andriy Yermak, who was ousted in November amid a corruption scandal but denied wrongdoing.\n\nNew defence and energy ministers will also be named in a reshuffle that had been put on hold ‍during negotiations on a possible peace deal that produced no sign of a breakthrough.\n\nRussia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, holds about one-fifth of Ukrainian territory including Crimea, which it seized in 2014. Kyiv says the advances have come at huge losses for Russia.\n\nZelenskiy has also appointed First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsia ​as a first deputy to Budanov, bringing a member of Ukraine's negotiating team into his administration.\n\nSome commanders rushed to Maliuk's defence after ‌reports of his looming exit circulated at the weekend.\n\nDrone forces chief Robert Brovdi said replacing him risked weakening \"one of Ukraine's key contemporary heavyweight\" agencies fighting Russia.\n\nSolomiia Bobrovska, a lawmaker on the defence, security and intelligence committee, said she did not think Maliuk's removal was \"necessary today\".\n\n\"In my opinion, under Maliuk's leadership, the SBU has been doing its job successfully in the current political situation, balancing between political tasks, combat operations and economic issues,\" she told Reuters.\n\nShe said Zelenskiy had effectively bypassed parliament by appointing Khmara as placeholder by decree.\n\nMaliuk, a career SBU official, overhauled the ⁠SBU after replacing Ivan Bakanov, who was dismissed by Zelenskiy in July 2022 ​for failing to root out Russian spies.\n\nMaliuk's most sophisticated operation, Spiderweb, used small drones ​hidden in cargo trucks to attack dozens of Russian highly valuable strategic bombers at airbases far from Ukraine's usual strike capabilities in May 2025.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously, told Reuters Maliuk had been asked to run the smaller ‍foreign intelligence service instead of the ⁠SBU, but declined.\n\nThe foreign spy service has no chief after its previous head was put in charge of the military intelligence agency. The head of the border guard service has also been replaced, another sign of the extensive security and defence reshuffle underway.\n\nMykhailo ⁠Fedorov, Zelenskiy's choice as defence minister, has not yet been approved by parliament. Zelenskiy said on Monday he wanted him to focus on technology and innovation to \"counter Russia's ‌desire to make this war endless.\"",

This bump is expected to generate about 1 trillion rubles, or $12.3 billion, in tax revenues.\n\nRussia is also planning to introduce a new tax on electronics in September.\n\nThe push for more aggressive tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhile Russia's sanctions-hit wartime economy appeared resilient in the first years of the war, cracks are emerging as persistently low oil prices are taking a toll.\n\nIn November, GDP expanded by just 0.1% from a year ago, according to official data. Industrial output declined 0.7%.\n\nIn the third quarter, Russia's GDP grew 0.6% from a year ago — sharply lower than the 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first.\n\nPutin has also ordered officials to restore economic growth and investment activity, while addressing structural problems across key sectors of the economy.\n\nAt the same time, the government is expected to keep inflation in check, with the target rate by the end of 2026 set within the central bank's forecast range of 4% to 5% — down from below 6% expected in 2025 and 9.5% in 2024.\n\nOil prices fell 20% in 2025 due to ample supply and slowing demand growth.\n\nDevelopments in the global oil market could add to that pressure. The US raid on Venezuela over the weekend is set to change the calculus for energy markets.\n\n\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry wrote on Monday that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid- to long-term. He said tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nThat view was echoed by John E. Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who pointed to President Donald Trump's plans for Venezuelan oil.\n\n\"Trump has said he intends to put Venezuelan oil — still under tough sanctions — back on the market,\" wrote Herbst on Monday.\n\n\"While this may take some time, it will help him reach his goal of driving down oil prices for US (and therefore global) consumers. This will be another big hit to the Russian economy,\" he added.\n\nVenezuela holds some of the world's largest oil reserves. But analysts say reviving the country's oil industry could take years due to aging infrastructure, decades of under-investment, sanctions, and political instability.",

    "fullText": "ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday told reporters that U.S. officials have determined that Ukraine did not target a residence belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week, disputing Kremlin claims that Trump had initially greeted with deep concern.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last week said Ukraine launched a wave of drones at Putin’s state residence in the northwestern Novgorod region that the Russian defense systems were able to defeat. Lavrov also criticized Kyiv for launching the attack at a moment of intensive negotiations to end the war.\n\nThe allegation came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had traveled to Florida for talks with Trump on the U.S. administration's still-evolving 20-point plan aimed at ending the war. Zelenskyy quickly denied the Kremlin allegation.\n\nTrump said that “something happened nearby” Putin's residence but that Americans officials didn't find the Russian president's residence was targeted.\n\n“I don’t believe that strike happened,\" Trump told reporters as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his home in Florida. “We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.”\n\nTrump addressed the U.S. determination after European officials argued that the Russian claim was nothing more than an effort by Moscow to undermine the peace effort.\n\nBut Trump, at least initially, had appeared to take the Russian allegations at face value. He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.\n\nThe U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nBut Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian military leader on Putin’s hit-list conned the Kremlin out of $500,000 by faking his own death to collect the bounty, Kyiv revealed on Thursday.\n\nDenis Kapustin, a far-right military commander and founder of the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), a battalion of far-right Russians who fight for Ukraine against Putin, was reported to have been killed in a drone strike in Zaporizhia on December 27 after spending months atop the Kremlin’s most wanted list.\n\n“We will definitely avenge you, Denis,” the RVC wrote in a Telegram post ‘confirming’ Kapustin’s death. “Your legacy lives on.”\n\nBut in a stunning twist, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) revealed on Thursday that the assassination of Kapustin, 41, had instead been part of an elaborate hoax cooked up by Kyiv to save the militia leader’s life and trick Russia into paying them a half-a-million dollar bounty that had been placed on his head.\n\n“Welcome back to life,” HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov announced in a video on January 1, congratulating Kapustin on bamboozling the Kremlin.\n\n“First of all, Mr. Denis, congratulations on your return to life. That is always a pleasure. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle,” he said. “I wish us all and you personally success.”\n\nBudanov, who described Kapustin as a “personal enemy” of Vladimir Putin, said the plot had taken more than a month to organize and that the commander would promptly return to the frontlines to continue his duties after swindling the Kremlin out of its cash.\n\nKapustin, better known by his callsign of ‘White Rex,’ also confirmed his role in the plot and said his “temporary absence” had not affected his unit’s effectiveness on the battlefield.\n\n“I am ready to move to the area of operations and continue commanding the RDK,” he said.\n\nFormed in 2022, the RVC was one of several international brigades composed of dissident Russians who took up arms against Putin and played a key role in cross-border excursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Kursk regions in 2023 and 2024.\n\nBut Kapustin, who has been formally named a terrorist by the Russian government, has long been considered a controversial ally to Ukraine due to his association with several neo-Nazi and far-right groups, which saw him banned from entering almost the entire European Union, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain, in 2019 because of his extremist views.\n\nThe RVC describes its members as holding “conservative views and traditionalist beliefs” but has denied accusations of neo-Nazism, instead claiming their goal is to establish a “true nation-state for Russians” that “lives in peace with the nations that surround it.”\n\n“I have my set of views, it’s a patriotic set of views, it’s a traditionalist set of views, it’s a right-wing set of views,” Kapustin told Al Jazeera in 2023.\n\n“You’ll never find me waving a flag with a swastika, you’ll never find me raising my hand in a Hitler sign. So why would you call me that?”",

    "description": "The UK military expected to see more high-end Russian equipment, like T-14s and Su-57s, in Ukraine, an officer said. They're not there though.",
    "fullText": "A British Army officer said that the military was surprised it did not see more advanced Russian weaponry, like some of its best tanks, on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\n\"We probably would've expected to have seen more of their prestige equipment,\" Maj. Maguire told Business Insider, speaking on the condition that only his rank and last name be used. He previously helped lead the UK-led training for Ukrainian soldiers and also produced reports for the UK and allies on tactics in Ukraine and the lessons Western forces could draw from them.\n\nOne example he gave of Russian equipment that hasn't been seen is the T-14, considered Russia's most advanced tank.\n\nThat kind of warfighting equipment is what the British military sort of sees as \"the pacing threat equipment that we train against.\"\n\nThe T-14, estimated to cost between $5 million and $9 million, is regarded as one of Russia's best tanks. Western analysts had worried the tanks might rival NATO's most advanced tanks. Russian state media has often touted the Armata as \"cutting edge.\"\n\nYet these weapons haven't been seen in the war. Sergei Chemezov, the CEO of Rostec, which produces the Armata, previously said the tanks might not be well-suited for Ukraine.\n\n\"Armata is, in general, a little expensive,\" he said. \"In terms of functionality, it is, of course, much superior to existing tanks, but it is too expensive, so the army is unlikely to use it now.\"\n\nThe UK expected this kind of prestige equipment, but instead these tanks \"haven't really been used, and I think that's probably more surprising than the fact that they've used a lot of their stockpiles and stuff,\" Maguire said.\n\nThe Russians have relied heavily on tanks like T-90s and T-80s, as well as some decades-old equipment, some first deployed in the 1940s. It has been pulling old tanks out of storage rather than putting its most capable assets, at least on paper, out onto the battlefield.\n\nIts stores are vast, with numerous tanks built for a Cold War fight, and building new tanks is a long process, even with Russia's ramped-up defense industry output. Sophisticated machinery takes time to build, and the Western sanctions at crippling the industry don't make it any easier.\n\nMaguire did not speculate on why Russia is not using the T-14, but the UK Ministry of Defence has previously weighed in.\n\nIt said last year that the Armata's absence was \"highly likely due to the potential reputational damage of losing the 'prestige' vehicle in combat and the requirement to produce greater quantities of MBTs which can only be satisfied by other variants.\"\n\nAn earlier ministry intelligence update that Russian troops in Ukraine were reluctant to accept the first tranche of T-14s that were offered to them \"because the vehicles were in such poor condition.\"\n\nRussia's confidence in the tank is unclear; however, it notably reduced its own order for the tanks, instead focusing on modernizing older types. Western analyses say the tank is impressive but also appears to be more vulnerable than Russia has said.\n\nThe war has not been kind to tanks and other armored vehicles. It is a fight in which neither side has achieved air superiority and cheap drones and mines threaten anything that moves. Considering the substantial losses, cost-effective mass has often proven more valuable than exquisite combat power.\n\nBeyond the T-14, Russia also hasn't sent in its fifth-generation fighters, its Su-57s. These aircraft are built for this kind of war, where air defenses make the skies extremely dangerous for older fourth-gen jets. Russia hasn't made the progress it hoped for in Ukraine, yet these planes are still largely sitting out the fight.\n\nThe UK defense ministry said in 2023 that the Su-57's usage seemed limited to Russian territory and launching long-range air-to-surface or air-to-air missiles into Ukraine. It said Russia was \"highly likely prioritising avoiding the reputational damage, reduced export prospects, and the compromise of sensitive technology which would come from any loss\" of the jet over Ukraine.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the Su-57 stealth and combat capabilities, with some speculation that it may not be a true fifth-gen aircraft. A former UK air force officer turned analyst previously told Business Insider that Russia was likely saving them for a possible conflict with NATO.\n\nWhen it comes to the high-level equipment Russia isn't using, Maguire said, \"I have no idea why they're not using it, but I'm pretty sure whatever it is, we could defeat it with what we have.\"\n\nRussia has put some advanced systems into the war; however, the few weapons that have made an appearance haven't \"performed very well,\" the major said.\n\nHe pointed to Ukraine's destruction of Russia's newly developed BMPT \"Terminator\", a 23-foot-long armored vehicle carrying a host of weapons. Ukraine has also been able to shoot down the Kinzhal missiles Russia boasted were unstoppable with Patriots, and Russia's S-400 air defense system, while still formidable, has somewhat underperformed.\n\nRussia's military in general has underperformed compared to Western expectations, including in its failure to quickly overpower Ukraine, which has left it bogged down in a grinding fight in the east. NATO officials also say the quality of its military has degraded throughout the war, though others have noted its learning too, making it a threat the West is watching closely.",

    "description": "Drones have turned the front line into a kill zone, and made casualty evacuation extremely difficult and dangerous.",
    "fullText": "NATO forces would likely see heavier losses than Ukraine has in a war with Russia, a senior officer told Business Insider, and that possibility is driving a rethink of battlefield medical care.\n\nDrones are watching much of the front line, making it nearly impossible to get wounded troops access to medical care within the \"golden hour,\" the critical first 60 minutes after a severe injury when access to medical care may determine life or death.\n\nGolden hour is found only in books, said Ukrainian Col. Valerii Vyshnivskyi, the country's senior representative to the NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis Training and Education Centre (JATEC).\n\nNow, there's only a golden day or month, he continued. \"The battlefield is visible 100%. That's why medical evacuation cannot be done in the old way.\"\n\nThe sky above the battlefield is filled with drones of all types executing both reconnaissance and strike missions. That saturation means Ukrainians often have to wait for unfavorable weather conditions and poor visibility to evacuate casualties. Some solutions, such as ground robots, are becoming more popular, but those systems aren't without their problems. They are vulnerable to attack, they break down, and they are susceptible to jamming.\n\nIn a high-intensity conflict against Russia, NATO forces would probably face the same casualty evacuation issues that Ukraine is dealing with, Vyshnivskyi said. However, he believes the military alliance would suffer heavier combat losses, as such a war has the potential to be significantly more destructive.\n\nNow nearly four years into the war, neither Ukraine nor Russia has publicly disclosed how many of their soldiers have been killed or wounded in combat. However, the total losses across both sides are unquestionably high.\n\nUkraine has suffered an estimated 400,000 casualties, including up to 100,000 troops killed, according to figures reported over the summer. Russia's toll is even grimmer: the UK defense ministry said last month that Moscow has likely taken more than 1.1 million casualties since its 2022 invasion and is now losing over 1,000 troops a day.\n\nWestern leaders have warned that the carnage, while presently unfolding on the battlefield and in Ukrainian cities, could expand deeper into Europe.\n\n\"Russia could be ready to use military force against NATO within five years,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a speech last month, later adding that such a conflict would result in \"extreme losses.\"\n\nNATO is becoming increasingly aware of the threat that drones pose to the treatment and evacuation of wounded troops in armed conflict, and it is preparing to meet that challenge. The alliance is working to source solutions from the medical and defense industries to save lives on a drone-infested battlefield.\n\nCompanies from 20 nations submitted 175 applications to showcase solutions at an \"Innovation Challenge\" hosted by NATO Allied Command Transformation (ACT) and JATEC — a key initiative that uses real-time lessons from the war to inform Western defense planning — in London last month.\n\nTen finalists presented ideas, which included a portable system to treat kidney failure, a jury-rigged stretcher design for evacuation over rough terrain, a secure communications portal for medics, ballistic plates for makeshift shelter, and other innovative solutions.\n\nBritish Army Col. Niall Aye Maung, the medical branch head for NATO's ACT and the medical advisor to the alliance headquarters in Brussels, referred to the ideas as a \"system of systems,\" where there's no single solution for battlefield casualty treatment and medical care. Instead, they'd function together.\n\nACT officials are now examining how to overhaul the NATO medical system to meet the demands of a large-scale war, Maung told Business Insider — and they're turning to Ukraine's experience to find medical solutions, including through events like the innovation challenge.\n\nVyshnivskyi, the Ukrainian officer, said Western leaders and industry are starting to understand the challenges that Ukraine is dealing with on the battlefield.\n\nHowever, one of NATO's biggest problems, he said, is that building new capabilities takes far too long — much slower than the battlefield is changing.\n\nFor medical gear, the research and development process can be lengthy because items must undergo regulatory and legal processes to ensure their safety. Still, Maung said that most solutions NATO is looking for are commercial off-the-shelf products with dual-use applications in both civilian and military settings. This can speed up procurement timelines.\n\nQuicker procurement is something NATO is exploring well beyond medical capabilities, as allies look to keep pace with the evolution of war technology on the battlefield. Drones and other emerging technologies are at the center of these efforts.\n\n\"If we want to react and innovate at speed, we have to accept and respect that the speed of innovation in commercial markets and civilian markets is a lot faster than in traditional military markets, especially if you're looking at non-traditional armaments,\" Bart Hollants, NATO's innovation broker, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the Ukraine war continues, European militaries continue to buy up weapons and strengthen their defenses — especially nations along NATO's Eastern flank that border Russia — and prepare for the possibility of a larger war.\n\nRutte, NATO's secretary general, said during his speech last month that Europe needs \"to be ready\" because modern wars are \"no longer fought at arm's length.\"\n\n\"Conflict is at our door,\" he warned. \"Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured.\"",

The list did not include strikes on occupied parts of the Kherson region.\n\nLykhovii noted that Russia has repeatedly used disinformation and false statements to disrupt the ongoing peace negotiations.\n\nThe Associated Press could not independently verify claims made about the attack.\n\nRussia's accusations against Ukraine come amid a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Moscow alleged that Kyiv launched a long-range drone attack against a residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in northwestern Russia overnight from Sunday to Monday.\n\nKyiv has called the allegations of an attack on Putin’s residence a ruse to derail ongoing peace negotiations, which have ramped up in recent weeks on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nIn his New Year’s address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a peace deal was “90% ready” but warned that the remaining 10%, believed to include key sticking points such as territory, would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live.”\n\nTrump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that he, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner had a “productive call” with the national security advisers of Britain, France, Germany and Ukraine “to discuss advancing the next steps in the European peace process.”\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, Russia conducted what local authorities called “one of the most massive” drone attacks at Zaporizhzhia overnight.\n\nAt least nine Russian drones struck the city, damaging dozens of residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure, head of the regional administration, Ivan Fedorov, wrote on Telegram on Friday. There were no casualties, the official said.\n\nOverall, Russia fired 116 long-range drones at Ukraine last night, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said that 86 drones were intercepted, while 27 more have reached their targets.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry reported Friday that its air defenses intercepted 64 Ukrainian drones overnight over multiple Russian regions.\n\nVyacheslav Gladkov, governor of Russia's Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine, on Friday also accused Ukrainian forces of carrying out a missile strike on the city of Belgorod. Two women were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said. The strike shattered windows in multiple residential buildings and damaged an unspecified “commercial” facility and a number of cars, according to the official.",

    "fullText": "As far as the Russians were concerned, they had got their man.\n\nDenis Kapustin, one of the most prominent anti-Putin Russians fighting on behalf of Ukraine, was reported dead on Dec 27, assassinated by a drone on the southern front.\n\nHe had long been hunted by Moscow and the price on his head reflected this: Russian intelligence services had offered $500,000 (£370,000) to anyone who killed him.\n\nRussia paid this out after news broke of the successful hit this week. But what Vladimir Putin’s intelligence services did not know was that they had handed the money directly to Ukraine.\n\nMr Kapustin, known by his nom de guerre “White Rex”, founded the pro-Ukrainian Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) in 2022.\n\nThe group made headlines in 2023 and 2024 when it carried out cross-border incursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Kursk regions, humiliating the Russian president and his generals.\n\nHis death was first confirmed by the RDK itself. “We will definitely take revenge, Denis,” the group said on Telegram. “Your legacy lives on.”\n\nYet on New Year’s Day, in a morale-raising ruse, Mr Kapustin re-emerged – alive and unscathed – in a video posted by Ukraine’s military intelligence (HUR).\n\n“Welcome back to life,” Gen Kyrylo Budanov, head of HUR, said with a wry smile. He congratulated Mr Kapustin and his team on a successful operation to deceive their Russian adversaries.\n\nIt turns out HUR, along with the RDK, had hatched a plan to fake Mr Kapustin’s death and claim the $500,000 bounty from Russia for themselves, to be used in Ukraine’s war effort.\n\n“First of all, Mr Denis, congratulations on your return to life. That is always a pleasure. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle,” Gen Budanov added.\n\nRussia’s FSB and GRU agencies have long been feared for their ruthlessness.\n\nBut Ukrainian intelligence, throughout the near four-year war, has consistently proved its ability to outsmart their Russian counterparts, carrying out assassinations of generals and Kremlin officials on Russian soil, orchestrating complex sabotage operations and recruiting Russian agents.\n\nIn November, it was reported that Ukraine’s intelligence services used Russia’s own agents to accept missions offered openly by the FSB for financial reward and sabotaging its objectives.\n\nIn one case, a Ukrainian double-agent accepted a task from a Russia jobs board to build a bomb, which was then handed to a Russian saboteur.\n\nThe bomb, however, was made using flour and the Russian agent was captured by Ukraine after it failed to detonate.\n\nUkraine has also claimed responsibility for assassinations of high-ranking Russian officials, while Kyiv is suspected to have been behind many others.\n\nIn April, Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy chief of the main operations directorate of Russia’s army, was killed by a car bomb on Nesterov Boulevard in the Balashikha suburb of Moscow.\n\nBaza, a Russian media outlet with sources inside law enforcement agencies, said the home-made bomb was strapped to a parked Volkswagen car and detonated remotely when Moskalik, who lived in the neighbourhood, walked past.\n\nA month later, a former Ukrainian politician was shot dead in what appeared to be a professional hit job at the entrance of an exclusive school in Madrid.\n\nAndriy Portnov, a pro-Russian politician who worked as a close aide to the Moscow regime, was dropping off his daughters when an assassin shot him several times.\n\nThe shooting took place at the American School of Madrid while other parents were also making the school run.\n\nMost recently, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, 56, head ‍of the Russian army’s operational training ‍directorate, died in an explosion on Dec 22 in Moscow, probably planted by Ukrainian special forces.\n\nThe force of the explosion was such that at least seven cars parked nearby also sustained damage\n\nThe general worked in the Russian ministry of defence and participated in combat operations in Chechnya, Syria and Ossetia as well as Ukraine.\n\nAmong the most striking assassinations was the killing of Lt Gen Igor Kirillov on Dec 17 2024.\n\nThe officer, who was in charge of Russia’s nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, was killed by a remotely detonated device hidden inside an electric scooter.\n\n“Kirillov was a war criminal and an absolutely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against the Ukrainian military,” a Ukrainian security source said.\n\nIn a daring mission in June 2025 – dubbed Operation Spiderweb – Ukraine-operated drones destroyed several Russian surveillance aircraft and nuclear-capable bombers, with officials in Kyiv saying this rendered a third of Russia’s strategic cruise missile carriers useless.\n\nThe drones had been smuggled into Russia and assembled, and launched from trucks deep within Russian territory, in another huge victory for Ukraine’s spies.\n\nUkraine’s latest intelligence success means Denis Kapustin, a far-Right extremist and former football hooligan, is inside Ukrainian territory and “preparing to continue carrying out assigned tasks”, said a Ukrainian commander.\n\nThe commander’s family moved from Moscow to Germany when Mr Kapustin was 17 and he relocated to Ukraine in 2017.\n\nSince 2019, he has been banned from entering the Schengen Area for promoting neo-Nazi ideology.\n\nIn the early weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Mr Kapustin helped set up units that would become Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade that played a key role in defending Kyiv and later become renowned for its fierce fighting on the eastern front.\n\nResponding to reports of his death, the 3rd Army Corps said: “We together confronted the common enemy in the battle for Kyiv.”\n\nIt added on Dec 27: “He perceived [Ukraine] as a place of real resistance and freedom.”\n\nIn August 2022, Mr Kapustin set up the RDK, with the goal of overthrowing Putin to bring “peace to Russia”. Its stated aim is to end Putin’s regime of “lies, corruption, and lawlessness”.\n\nIt is made up of former Wagner Group recruits, some former FSB agents and civilian volunteers. It is deemed a terrorist organisation by Russia.\n\nRussian courts have twice sentenced Mr Kapustin to life imprisonment in absentia on treason and terrorism charges.\n\nIn March 2024, the RDK stormed into Russia alongside other anti-Kremlin militias on tanks and armoured vehicles. It clashed with Russian security services and captured Russian soldiers.\n\nKyiv has said that while it fights as part of Ukraine’s military, under its command, the incursions into Russia were not taking place under Kyiv’s orders.\n\nSince its incursions, the group is either fighting at the front or engaged in cross-border sabotage operations in Russia.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph in September, an RDK commander known as “White”, a 26-year-old Russian volunteer, described how he joined in order to exact revenge on Putin for invading Ukraine.\n\n“We fight to change something in Russia,” he said. “When the war ends, I will continue fighting until Putin falls.”",

    "description": "A New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.",
    "fullText": "United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addresses a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025 \n\nA New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart during which he seemed much more concerned with his appearance than policy.\n\nThe Times published a comprehensive story about the Trump administration’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday in which it suggested that Hegseth began his tenure at the Pentagon “as something of a blank slate on the war.”\n\n“He didn’t have any of his own thoughts on Russia and Ukraine,” an ex-Pentagon official told the Gray Lady. “But he had civilian advisers who did.”\n\nOn Day 4, the freshly minted defense secretary sat at a Pentagon conference table as one of his coterie of advisers argued for an immediate U-turn.\n\nThe ideological godfather of the group was Elbridge A. Colby, grandson of the Nixon-era C.I.A. director William E. Colby. The younger Mr. Colby and Mr. Vance had been introduced in 2015 by an editor at National Review who thought they were like-minded. Nearly nine years later, as Mr. Biden poured billions of dollars into arming Ukraine, Mr. Colby argued that “we would have been better served to put a lot more of that money to use in the Pacific.”\n\nNow, it was one of his disciples, Dan Caldwell, presenting the group’s recommendations to Mr. Hegseth, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other military leaders.\n\nThe Pentagon, Mr. Caldwell argued, should pause delivery of certain munitions that the Biden administration had promised to Ukraine, because, he believed, existing stocks were insufficient to execute America’s war plans around the world. Nor should it use the additional $3.8 billion left unspent by the Biden administration to buy weapons for Ukraine.\n\nGeneral Brown did not speak as Mr. Caldwell wrapped up. He simply shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\n\nDuring a trip to Europe the next month, Hegseth reportedly made sure to powder his nose for the cameras, but declined to answer Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov’s queries:\n\nThe Ukrainians had repeatedly requested a proper sit-down. Instead it would be a brief stand-up affair in an anteroom.\n\nBeforehand, according to an American official present, Mr. Hegseth dabbed his nose with powder from a small compact. “Look commanding,” he told one aide. The handshake with the Ukrainian might be shown on Fox; the president might be watching.\n\nThen the standing meeting began, Mr. Umerov coming in close, taking his voice down to a whisper, assuring the secretary that he knew America’s political and security agenda might be changing. He didn’t ask for new aid. He just needed to know one thing: Would the U.S. military continue to supply the munitions Ukraine was counting on, the ones approved by Mr. Biden? Every delivery sustained the lives of Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines; every delivery that didn’t arrive one day meant those soldiers would die the next.\n\nAgain and again, Mr. Umerov repeated his plea: “I just need you to be honest with me. Just be honest with me.”\n\nHegseth allegedly offered Umerov only nodding.\n\n“He wasn’t pleading for the answer that he wanted, but just for honesty, some indication,” observed one U.S. official. “He was saying: You can trust me; you can trust us. Just tell me what you guys are thinking.”\n\nThe post New York Times Deep Dive Alleges Pete Hegseth Donned Makeup for Ukraine Photo Op — Then Ignored Counterpart first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Russia is using helicopters to try to stop Ukraine's drones. Now its naval drones armed with missiles keep Russia's helicopters away, per a commander.",
    "fullText": "Russian helicopters are now steering clear of Ukraine's naval drones because they are vulnerable to the surface-to-air missiles some carry, a Ukrainian special forces commander said.\n\nThe commander, call sign Thirteen, leads \"Group 13,\" a special forces unit within Ukraine's defense intelligence agency, the GUR, that uses naval drones. He said that Russian helicopters initially \"posed a critical threat and made our work difficult.\"\n\nHowever, the naval drones evolved to counter the aircraft. Specifically, Ukraine armed them with missiles.\n\n\"After that, the enemy stopped using helicopters against us altogether, realising they had become easy targets for our missiles,\" Thirteen said. He spoke earlier this month at a GUR showcase about Ukraine's naval drones, and his comments were reported by Ukrainian outlet Pravda.\n\nThe commander did not specify when this change occurred, but his update indicates an increasingly successful role for Ukraine's pioneering naval drones. The drones achieved tremendous wins against Russian warships, forcing Russia to relocate its naval vessels and increase combat air patrols. Now, it appears the new missile-armed naval drones are seeing success in driving away the air patrols.\n\nUkraine claimed its first naval drone kill of a Russian helicopter last December, calling it a first worldwide. It said a Magura V5 sea drone destroyed a Russian Mi-8 helicopter with missiles. Ukraine has since claimed more helicopter hits with its naval drones.\n\nThe usefulness of helicopters has shifted throughout the war. Russia saw its Ka-52 attack helicopters defeat Ukrainian armor but also suffered losses to air defenses, the proliferation of which has made it extremely difficult for either side to take control of the skies.\n\nRussian helicopters, much like Ukraine's, have broadly been vulnerable to interceptors and drones, both aerial first-person-view (FPV) drones and now naval drones. They're increasingly employed with caution but still used for troop transport, logistical support, evacuations, armed support, air assault missions, and drone hunts.\n\nUkraine, for instance, has new helicopter units dedicated to shooting down Russian drones. Notably, though, they're engaging Shahed-style long-range one-way attack drones that Russia uses to attack cities, not front-line attack drones.\n\nThe naval drones' ability to shoot down helicopters reflects how rapidly the systems have evolved to hit a wider range of targets. Early in the war, the drones were used mainly as explosive-laden attack craft, ramming Russian warships and other vessels.\n\nAlong with aerial drones, they helped Ukraine blunt Russia's naval power despite Ukraine lacking a traditional navy, including by forcing much of Russia's Black Sea Fleet to withdraw to ports farther from Ukraine. The fleet used to be based in Sevastopol but is now positioned primarily at Novorossiysk.\n\nOver time, Ukraine has expanded the drones' capabilities by adding missile and rocket launchers, guns, and even other drones that can be launched from the vessels. New variants and missions have followed, including drones that have downed Russian fighter jets and others designed specifically to strike Russian assets on rivers.\n\nUkraine makes its own sea drones, including Magura variants and the Sea Baby. Russia has also gotten into the naval drone business, and the West is increasingly paying attention to the impact that the assets can have in war.",

    "description": "Ukraine uses robots to evacuate injured troops, but it can also make them into targets.",
    "fullText": "New video footage from Russia's war against Ukraine shows a ground robot transporting an injured Ukrainian soldier being hit by a Russian drone.\n\nUsing ground robots to rescue soldiers is just one way Ukraine is putting its growing fleet to work. The uncrewed vehicles also move supplies, lay and remove mines, and attack Russian targets. Employing bots for battlefield casualty evacuation helps keep medical crews out of harm's way, but it can also leave an injured soldier exposed and vulnerable to attack.\n\nUkraine's 1st Separate Medical Battalion shared the footage on Monday, revealing that the soldier was safely evacuated. The rescue robot took the hit and protected him. The soldier didn't sustain any additional injuries during the 3-hour and 25-minute mission.\n\nThe soldier had been injured by a drone drop and was unable to walk by himself. Reaching him meant navigating territory with a significant Russian presence, and the planned return journey was 36 miles.\n\nA post shared by Перший окремий медичний батальйон (@1med.army)\n\nThey decided to send a robot controlled from afar by soldiers in safer positions, the battalion said. Ukraine uses robots to carry out missions too hazardous for humans.\n\nThe robot detected a Russian drone soon after the injured soldier was loaded on, the battalion said. The team decided to continue moving at maximum speed, but the drone hit the robot on its second attempt, two and a half miles into the journey.\n\nThe soldier did not suffer any new injuries from the attack, as he was contained in the robot's armored capsule. The robot, however, was damaged, the battalion said.\n\nHe was evacuated by another Ukrainian unit nearby and got the treatment he needed, it said. The robot was also recovered. Business Insider was unable to independently verify the details reported by the battalion.\n\nThe video shows a ground robot moving through a rural area at night, stopping as soldiers load an injured comrade aboard and close a protective lid. The robot then drives on, before aerial footage appears to show an explosion above it.\n\nThe video then shows the wounded soldier speaking after the mission, along with footage of the damaged robot. The battalion said his treatment is continuing.\n\nA host of companies are developing Ukraine's robot fleet, and innovation is rapid, with soldiers even updating them on the battlefield.\n\nHowever, they are risky, particularly if they lack cages like the one in this attack. Robots are targets for Russia's swarms of ever-present drones.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, the head of the robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that using robots can sometimes put the soldier at greater risk, as it takes them from where they may have been able to hide or be with comrades out into the open.\n\nThey use humans for evacuations where possible, though that isn't without risks, and robots as a last resort.\n\nGround robots conduct less than 1% of Ukraine's drone missions; however, their use is growing. And the West is testing and prototyping uncrewed vehicle designs relying on what Ukraine is learning.",

    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they will drop an investigation of Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, over possible breaches of sanctions and money laundering rules after he agreed to pay a 10 million euro (about $11.8 million) fine.\n\nThe Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire and metals magnate, who was reelected as the president of the International Fencing Federation last year, has been facing European Union sanctions imposed after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nThe Munich prosecutors office said Tuesday the probe of Usmanov, which prompted police raids of dozens of properties in Germany linked to him three years ago, will be dropped upon receipt of payment of the fine.\n\nSome funds and assets linked to Usmanov had been frozen under the EU sanctions.\n\nProsecutors said Usmanov was suspected of transferring about 1.5 million euros through foreign-based companies for management of two properties in the lakeside town of Rottach-Egern south of Munich, in the months after the sanctions were imposed.\n\nHe was also alleged to have failed to declare valuables including jewelry, paintings and wines to authorities. Usmanov's defense team had challenged the allegations about his ties to the companies and valuables and the applicability of EU law in the case.\n\nThe prosecutors said the discontinuation of the investigation upon payment of a fine was authorized under German criminal law.",

    "description": "Ukraine uses robots to evacuate injured troops, but it can also make them into targets.",
    "fullText": "A ground robot evacuating a wounded Ukrainian soldier was attacked by a Russian drone.\n\nHis battalion said the robot was damaged, but the soldier was protected and had no new injuries.\n\nRobots are increasingly used by Ukraine but are also targets and can put hurt troops in more danger.\n\nNew video footage from Russia's war against Ukraine shows a ground robot transporting an injured Ukrainian soldier being hit by a Russian drone.\n\nUsing ground robots to rescue soldiers is just one way Ukraine is putting its growing fleet to work. The uncrewed vehicles also move supplies, lay and remove mines, and attack Russian targets. Employing bots for battlefield casualty evacuation helps keep medical crews out of harm's way, but it can also leave an injured soldier exposed and vulnerable to attack.\n\nUkraine's 1st Separate Medical Battalion shared the footage on Monday, revealing that the soldier was safely evacuated. The rescue robot took the hit and protected him. The soldier didn't sustain any additional injuries during the 3-hour and 25-minute mission.\n\nThe soldier had been injured by a drone drop and was unable to walk by himself. Reaching him meant navigating territory with a significant Russian presence, and the planned return journey was 36 miles.\n\nThey decided to send a robot controlled from afar by soldiers in safer positions, the battalion said. Ukraine uses robots to carry out missions too hazardous for humans.\n\nThe robot detected a Russian drone soon after the injured soldier was loaded on, the battalion said. The team decided to continue moving at maximum speed, but the drone hit the robot on its second attempt, two and a half miles into the journey.\n\nThe soldier did not suffer any new injuries from the attack, as he was contained in the robot's armored capsule. The robot, however, was damaged, the battalion said.\n\nHe was evacuated by another Ukrainian unit nearby and got the treatment he needed, it said. The robot was also recovered. Business Insider was unable to independently verify the details reported by the battalion.\n\nThe video shows a ground robot moving through a rural area at night, stopping as soldiers load an injured comrade aboard and close a protective lid. The robot then drives on, before aerial footage appears to show an explosion above it.\n\nThe video then shows the wounded soldier speaking after the mission, along with footage of the damaged robot. The battalion said his treatment is continuing.\n\nA host of companies are developing Ukraine's robot fleet, and innovation is rapid, with soldiers even updating them on the battlefield.\n\nHowever, they are risky, particularly if they lack cages like the one in this attack. Robots are targets for Russia's swarms of ever-present drones.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, the head of the robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that using robots can sometimes put the soldier at greater risk, as it takes them from where they may have been able to hide or be with comrades out into the open.\n\nThey use humans for evacuations where possible, though that isn't without risks, and robots as a last resort.\n\nGround robots conduct less than 1% of Ukraine's drone missions; however, their use is growing. And the West is testing and prototyping uncrewed vehicle designs relying on what Ukraine is learning.",

They died in a foreign country. And some are celebrated people, they’re very celebrated. But it’s so sad that a thing like that would happen.”\n\nHe then immediately moved on to the next question.\n\nSocial media users quickly noted that the president hadn’t thanked the fallen for their sacrifice, praised their commitment to freedom and democracy, or even offered his personal condolences.\n\nMany of the Americans who have died in Ukraine were U.S. military veterans.\n\nMike Meoli, 71, was a retired Navy Seal and firefighter who traveled to Ukraine to train medics on the front lines. He was killed in November 2024, ABC 10 News San Diego reported.\n\nNicholas Maimer, 45, was an Army Special Forces veteran and Idaho native who helped train Ukrainian officers. He was killed in May 2023 in an artillery barrage, according to Military.com.\n\nIan Frank Tortorici, 32, was a retired corporal with the U.S. Marines who fought on the front lines. He died in July 2023 after a Russian missile hit a restaurant where he was eating while on leave, Task and Purpose reported.\n\nThe U.S. government has declined to provide aid to American fighters to avoid any suggestion of a direct clash with Russia, which is a nuclear power, the Times reported in September.\n\nBut some social media users argued that Trump’s barely-there compassion for their families wasn’t measured diplomacy—it was reminiscent of the president’s previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during World War I were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.\n\nAlthough he failed to offer much comfort Sunday to the families of Americans who have died fighting Russia, Trump did manage to heap praise on the man who started the war.\n\n“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, prompting Zelensky to raise an eyebrow. “I was explaining to the president [Zelensky], President Putin was very generous in his feeling toward Ukraine succeeding.”\n\nHe also said he “understands” Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire while a longer-term agreement is being hashed out.\n\n“He feels that look, you know, they’re fighting and to stop, and if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn’t want to be in that position—I understand that position,” Trump said.\n\nPutin bombarded Ukraine with over 100 drones on Christmas Eve and early Christmas Day, killing at least seven civilians.\n\nSunday’s talks were intended to address security guarantees and possible territorial concessions, and while both sides said progress had been made, neither gave any indication that a deal was within reach.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States is offering Ukraine security guarantees for a period of 15 years as part of a proposed peace plan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, though he said he would prefer an American commitment of up to 50 years to deter Russia from further attempts to seize its neighbor’s land by force.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump hosted Zelenskyy at his Florida resort on Sunday and insisted that Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace settlement.\n\nNegotiators are still searching for a breakthrough on key issues, however, including whose forces withdraw from where and the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the 10 biggest in the world. Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.\n\n“Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,” Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.\n\nUkraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDetails of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the “presence” of partners. He didn’t elaborate, but Russia has said it won’t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv’s allies will meet in Paris in early January to “finalize each country’s concrete contributions” to the security guarantees.\n\nTrump said he would consider extending U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.\n\nHowever, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump slathered a fresh coat of makeup on his hand for another round of peace talks with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\nTrump, 79, welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to his Mar-a-Lago estate as he continues to chase down an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which he promised to end on his first day back in office.\n\nThe mismatched concealer on Trump’s hand was once again evident as he took questions from reporters.\n\nJust days ago, on Christmas Eve, the now-familiar bruising on Trump’s right hand was coupled with some discoloration on his left. On Sunday, however, his left hand seemed back to normal, while his right hand remained covered in makeup.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reverted to a statement she has been reusing since February when reached for comment by the Daily Beast.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” she said.\n\nLeavitt previously attributed the persistent bruising to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has closely catalogued the bruising on Trump’s hand, which he has been nursing for months. The makeup smears, together with Trump’s swollen ankles, mysterious MRI, mental flubs, and twice-in-a-year “annual” medical checkups, have raised concerns about the health of the oldest person to be inaugurated president.\n\nThe White House has consistently maintained that Trump is in “excellent health.”\n\nThe president was joined by several of his officials in Mar-a-Lago as he sat down for another meeting with Zelensky, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nA day before the meeting, Russia struck Kyiv with ballistic missiles and drones, killing at least one person and injuring 27 others.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump said he still believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was “very serious” about finding common ground with Ukraine.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, that’s good for everybody. There’s nothing more important,” he told reporters. “I’ve settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one. I thought it would be in the middle of the pack. This is the most difficult one, but we’re gonna get it done.”\n\nThe president stopped short of laying out a timeline for the end of peace talks.\n\n“I don’t have deadlines,” he said. “You know what my deadline is? Getting the war ended.”",

    "description": "A US Navy special operations veteran told BI that ground robots are helpful, but it's best to have more cheap one than fewer expensive ones.",
    "fullText": "With drones always buzzing overhead, ready to dive bomb soldiers or relay targeting data to an artillery gun crew, it can be far too dangerous to send a human being to rescue the wounded, so Ukraine is turning to robots to evacuate injured troops.\n\nA US veteran in Ukraine who saw them in action told Business Insider they're effective — and said Ukraine is right to keep them simple and cheap, given that many may not make it back.\n\nUkraine is using a growing number of ground robots, a kind of drone, to combat Russia's invasion by carrying supplies, acting as bombs, and evacuating injured soldiers.\n\nMany of these systems come from Ukrainian companies and manufacturers located within Ukraine's European partners. It's technology that militaries are increasingly paying attention to, seeing it as a solution that could save lives on the modern battlefield, though across NATO and Western forces, the focus is mainly on doctrine, testing, and prototyping.\n\nEven in Ukraine, uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) only make up a small fraction of the drones in use in battle.\n\nJeffrey Wells, a US Navy veteran with experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, is now helping out a nonprofit in Ukraine. He told Business Insider that using ground robots for casualty evacuation isn't perfect, but it's useful. He said that the West should take note but avoid overengineering or overspending on these kinds of systems.\n\nThe robots are \"not always a success, but at least it's something,\" he said.\n\nThe casualty evacuation robots function like remote-controlled stretchers, but rescuing wounded troops is far from foolproof: with so many drones overhead, they're easy to spot — and just as easy to attack.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have pointed to the limits of ground robots in evacuating the wounded, noting that while they can be a lifeline for a wounded soldier when it is too unsafe for their comrades to come get them, they can be jammed, they break down, and they can be targeted just like anything else moving in battle.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, head of robotic systems for the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that they are a last resort tool because a wounded soldier could wind up in \"an even worse situation.\"\n\nThey are a \"last hope kind of thing,\" Wells explained. \"And that shouldn't cost a lot of money and should be something that's easily developed, replaced, and deployed.\"\n\nWells' work in Ukraine aims to help civilians survive the war. He is there with Task Force Antal, a nonprofit organization run by US veterans that provides medical training, supplies, and evacuation support to civilians, especially in front-line areas.\n\nHe said that the evacuation robots don't need to be flawless technology — the tech is evolving so fast that whatever works today may well be redesigned next week anyway. What matters, he said, is getting something usable into the field now, because saving lives outranks engineering elegance.\n\nWells said the robot he saw in action was \"low tech\" but got the job done, explaining that he would rather have 10 robots worth $1,000 than one that was more advanced and worth $100,000.\n\n\"You kind of just need something that's effective, essentially a stretcher with wheels that gives hope to the person that's injured.\" It doesn't need to be more complicated than that.\n\nIn talks with Business Insider, Ukrainian soldiers, foreign volunteers, and arms makers have emphasized key lessons for the West: prioritize more cheap systems over a few exquisite ones, don’t pour money into technology that may quickly become obsolete, and resist the urge to overengineer and overspend on gear meant for a battlefield that changes every week.\n\nWhen it comes to robots for evacuation, Wells said that the best thing is to keep technology cheap and expendable so troops don't think they \"have to use this because it costs so much money.\"",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Several key issues remain unresolved in ongoing negotiations between Ukraine and the United States over a potential framework to end Russia’s war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week. Speaking about a 20-point plan under discussion, Zelenskyy outlined the most difficult points, noting that Ukraine has already conveyed its position to Washington, which is expected to communicate it to Moscow.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that the Kremlin had already been in contact with U.S. representatives since Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev recently met with U.S. envoys in Florida. However, he did not reveal any details, saying only: “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue.”\n\nZelenskyy said talks continue over the nature and scope of security guarantees that would be provided to Ukraine under any agreement. He said several technical issues remain, including how guarantees would be enforced and what monitoring mechanisms would be used to ensure compliance.\n\nZelenskyy said the fate of the territories that Russia claims remain the most difficult issue in the talks. He did not provide details, but has repeatedly said Kyiv will not recognize Russian control over occupied regions, including areas seized since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Zelenskyy has also repeatedly stated Ukraine will not cede territories it currently controls, which Russia has publicly demanded.\n\nZaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\n\nZelenskyy said the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains unresolved. The facility, Europe’s largest, has been under Russian control since early on in the war and has raised repeated international safety concerns due to fighting nearby.\n\nUkraine has been consistent in saying that safe operation of the station requires demilitarization of its territory, where Russia currently has troops stationed. Apart from that, Ukraine has been insisting that Ukrainian workers should be granted full access to the station, which they currently don’t have.\n\nDetails previously released in the course of the current negotiations revealed that the U.S. and Ukrainian teams are in discussion of a joint-access format, potentially between all three sides (the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia).\n\nZelenskyy said further discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. teams are expected, including talks in Florida, and that separate documents on economic recovery and prosperity are also under consideration.",

Jeanne Shaheen, Jacky Rosen, Chris Coons, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nThe message was not joined by more MAGA-friendly members of the committee, including its Republican chairman Jim Risch and Texas’ Ted Cruz.\n\nOnce firmly in control of congressional Republicans, Trump’s influence has weakened in recent months as his approval rating has plummeted and the GOP has lost in contests across the country.\n\nThe defeats suggest a path for Democrats to reclaim at least partial control of Congress in the 2026 midterms by flipping the House and even the Senate, leaving Trump to serve the remainder of his second term as a lame-duck president.\n\nMoreover, the trio of Republican senators is largely free from electoral pressure: Tillis is retiring in 2027, Moran faces reelection in 2028, and Barrasso in 2030.\n\nCritics have long accused Trump of playing into Putin’s hands while being hostile towards Ukraine and other traditional allies.\n\nIn recent months, he launched a diplomatic push to end the war, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, but his proposed peace plan initially reflected many of Putin’s demands, blindsiding Zelensky and European allies.\n\nThe demands included limitations on Ukraine’s military and, crucially, the surrender of territory to Russia.\n\nLast month, Trump melted down at Ukraine on Truth Social, claiming that Zelensky had shown “ZERO GRATITUDE” in a message echoing his tantrum at their contentious Oval Office meeting in February. Zelensky responded by thanking Trump again.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader announced Thursday that he’d had a “good conversation” with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nHe told reporters Friday that he plans to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine with Trump on Sunday, as well as the “sensitive issue” of possible territorial concessions.\n\nWhile Zelesnky said the 20-point plan under discussion “is about 90% ready,” he cautioned, “Russia constantly looks for reasons not to agree.”",

    "description": "Western militaries are looking at interceptor drones — proven in combat in Ukraine — as an ideal low-cost air defense.",
    "fullText": "NATO militaries are looking for cheaper ways to defeat hostile drones without having to expend vastly more expensive missiles. The answer, it seems, is in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian forces are using domestically produced interceptor drones daily to bring down deadly Russian drones, with units regularly sharing footage of the high-speed aerial chases.\n\nThe interceptor drones can be mass-produced, which is crucial for Ukraine as worsening Russian bombardments that sometimes include hundreds of drones and missiles in a single night put stress on the country's deeply strained air defense network.\n\nNATO is taking note, with officials identifying interceptor drones not just as a cheap way to fill a capability gap — air defense against relatively inexpensive attack drones — but also as an early indication of where warfare is going. Some allied countries are developing systems, while others are rushing to buy them at scale.\n\n\"Technology is evolving really, really rapidly,\" British Army Brig. Gen. Chris Gent, the deputy chief of staff for transformation and integration at NATO Allied Land Command, said at a recent training event in Poland. \"It's a race to keep up.\"\n\nInterceptor drones emerged this year as a priority defense investment for Ukraine as it looks for ways to stay ahead of Russia's growing drone production and worsening nightly attacks without totally depleting its surface-to-air missile stocks or breaking the bank to take out cheap yet inexpensive threats.\n\nUkraine's defense industry produces hundreds of interceptor drones each day, some of which cost as little as $2,500. That's a fraction of the cost of a standard Russian one-way attack drone, estimated to be worth $35,000 on the low end. They can carry small warheads and are designed to directly strike their targets midair or explode nearby for a proximity kill.\n\nThe interceptor drones have provided Kyiv with a significant increase in air defense options. They can reach higher and faster-moving targets than the truck-mounted machine guns that Ukrainian soldiers had long relied on to shoot down low-flying Russian airborne targets, and they allow the country to hold its critical surface-to-air missiles in reserve for higher-end threats.\n\nSeeing how effective interceptor drones have been, NATO is now racing to develop and field its own. That push took on new urgency in September after Russian drones strayed into Polish and Romanian airspace, prompting Western forces to scramble fighter jets.\n\nThe incursions — and NATO's scramble to respond — raised questions about how the alliance should handle cheap drones, and whether it's sustainable to launch fighter jets armed with expensive missiles for every airspace violation.\n\nWhile NATO is still flying fighter patrols, Poland and Romania have purchased and are deploying the American-made Merops system, which consists of an interceptor drone that has already taken down more than 1,900 Russian targets for Ukraine.\n\nIn late November, Business Insider observed Polish, Romanian, and American forces training on the Merops system. Military officials touted the system's success in combat and its ability to provide NATO with a cheap air defense for its Eastern flank. (The interceptor drone costs $15,000, still less than the potential threats.)\n\nAt that training event, US Army Brig. Gen. Curtis King, the head of the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, said that NATO needs to \"learn from what Ukraine is fighting right now.\"\n\nHe said that in addition to Poland, Romania, and the US, other NATO allies are experimenting with similar systems, the aim being to employ this technology across the alliance.\n\nAnd Western countries are linking up with the Ukrainians on this technology as well. In September, for instance, the UK announced plans to mass-produce thousands of Ukrainian-designed interceptor drones for Kyiv. The US is also making these weapons in collaboration with Ukraine.\n\nThe general said that getting Western firms to produce more interceptor drones will help drive the cost down even further for NATO countries interested in acquiring this technology.\n\nThe value is clear, King said. Procuring interceptor drones would allow NATO countries to save sophisticated air defenses, such as the MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile system or certain air-to-air missiles, for threats like cruise and ballistic missiles, rather than one-way attack drones.\n\nInterceptor drones are among the newer innovations emerging from the war as Ukraine and Russia attempt to secure a technological advantage, with each new capability fielded pushing the other side to develop a countermeasure.\n\nAt the Merops training in Poland, Western officials said they are watching Ukraine and Russia race through cycles of weapons innovation at a pace that demands faster procurement before new tools become obsolete.\n\n\"The life cycle of technology has shortened dramatically,\" said Bart Hollants, NATO's innovation broker.\n\n\"It's not a new trend, but we see it on the battlefield in Ukraine,\" he told Business Insider, explaining that \"every six weeks to three months, there is a new iteration or a new version of tech that enters the front line, and that you have to defend yourself against, or that you have to create countermeasures for.\"\n\nWith that pacing in mind, NATO has turned to Western and Ukrainian defense firms for new ways to counter the war's biggest threats, giving these companies chances to pitch, test, and market systems as combat-ready.\n\nEarlier this year, NATO hosted an \"Innovation Challenge\" that brought in companies to present solutions for Russian glide bombs and one-way attack drones. Two firms — one French and the other German — won first and second place, respectively, for their solutions, made up of interceptor drones.\n\nFrench Cdr. Pierre Delom, a project coordinator at NATO's Allied Command Transformation who leads the Innovation Challenges, said that the alliance could find itself at war at any moment and needed to be ready.\n\nThe key, he told Business Insider, is the mass production of affordable air defenses so that NATO doesn't have to spend any more money to counter low-cost threats than necessary. In a future fight, these threats may be out in force, and the alliance can't afford to pour expensive missiles into that fight. Sustainability is about making every dollar count.",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — On a Christmas Day when the war in Ukraine casts a shadow over Europe, concerns over immigration divide societies, and some politicians fan anger and resentment, Britain’s King Charles III called on people to focus on kindness instead of conflict.\n\nDelivering his annual holiday address from Westminster Abbey, Charles said Thursday the Christmas story of wise men and shepherds traveling through the night to find their savior shows how we can find strength in the “companionship and kindness of others.”\n\n“To this day, in times of uncertainty, these ways of living are treasured by all the great faiths and provide us with deep wells of hope, of resilience in the face of adversity,” Charles said. “Peace through forgiveness, simply getting to know our neighbors and by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships.”\n\n“In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong,” he added.\n\nThe speech, which concluded with a Christmas carol sung by a Ukrainian choir, comes as European leaders rally support for Ukraine amid signs that U.S. President Donald Trump is losing patience with America’s traditional European allies. At home, British politics have become increasingly bitter as Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government struggles to control unauthorized migration and bolster creaking public services.\n\nCharles, the titular head of the Church of England, chose Westminster Abbey as the site of his Christmas Day broadcast to underscore the theme of pilgrimage that ran through the speech. The abbey, known as the site of coronations and royal weddings, is also the focus of an annual pilgrimage honoring Edward the Confessor, an early king of England who was canonized as a saint in 1161.\n\n“Pilgrimage is a word less used today, but it is of particular significance for our modern world, and especially at Christmas,’’ he said. “This is about journeying forward into the future, while also journeying back to remember the past and learn from its lessons.”\n\nCharles and his family made their own pilgrimage on foot earlier in the day to St. Mary Magdalene Church on the king’s private Sandringham Estate, about 100 miles north of London.\n\nCharles and Queen Camilla, along with Prince William and his wife, Kate, and their children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, and extended family walked to the church and greeted the crowds of people after the service.\n\nEvents earlier this year marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II underscored the need to learn from the past, Charles said. While there are fewer and fewer living veterans of that conflict, we must remember the courage and sacrifice of those who fought the war and the way communities came together “in the face of such great challenge,” he said.\n\n“These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth,” he said. “As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.’’\n\nThe monarch’s annual holiday message is watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent nations, most of which have historic ties to Britain. The pre-recorded speech is broadcast at 3 p.m. London time, when many families are enjoying their traditional Christmas lunch.\n\nThe speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, is able to voice his own views and doesn’t seek guidance from the government.\n\nThis year’s address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said “good news” from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.\n\nThe king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a “precautionary phase” and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.\n\nThe speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, from the king to his grandchildren, George and Louis and Charlotte, meeting with the public and carrying out their royal duties.\n\nThat included scenes from the king’s historic trip to the Vatican as he works to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe event was the first time since King Henry VIII severed ties with Rome that the leaders of the two Christian churches, divided for centuries over issues that now include the ordination of female priests in the Church of England, have prayed together.\n\nThe king’s message was clear. Even if some years had passed, there’s always hope to start over. Peace is possible.",

    "fullText": "The majority of Russians expect the war with Ukraine to end in 2026, according to a poll released Wednesday.\n\nThe survey of 1,600 Russians aged 18 and above found that 55% believe what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" is nearing its end. The poll was conducted in mid-December by the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center.\n\nMikhail Mamonov, the deputy head of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, said as he presented the results at a roundtable discussion: \"The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president.\"\n\nIn previous years, when revealing the results of its annual poll, the organization did not provide data on the share of Russians expecting the war to end. It is hard to assess public sentiment about sensitive subjects like the war in Russia due to the country's tightly controlled public discourse.\n\nThe result came as Russia's economic boom, driven by wartime spending and subsidies, cooled.\n\nIn November, Russia's industrial output fell 0.7% from a year ago, following a 3.1% increase in October, Rosstat, Russia's official statistics agency, said Wednesday. Reuters reported that day that analysts expected a 1.2% increase in output.\n\nThe profits of Russian companies declined nearly 10% to 21.6 trillion rubles, or $273.4 billion, from January through October.\n\nHigh — but moderating — inflation, weaker energy revenues, a strong ruble, and tight credit have weighed on consumer demand and real incomes, squeezing private-sector activity.\n\nA separate, independent poll of 1,608 Russians aged 18 and above showed that the economy and the war with Ukraine were their top concerns. The survey conducted between November 18 and 27 by the Levada Center was published December 16.\n\nIn a tightly choreographed phone-in event Friday with ordinary Russian citizens and journalists, known as the \"Direct Line,\" Putin acknowledged a sharp slowdown in economic growth — to 1% this year from 4.3% in 2024. He attributed it to government measures aimed at improving inflation.\n\nWhile Ukraine dominated the discussion, the broadcast was punctuated by flashes of public frustration, as text messages from viewers were displayed on a large screen in the hall, Reuters reported.\n\nThere were complaints about internet outages, poor water quality, and the rising cost of living — a reminder of how economic pressures affect the lives of Russians.",

It said the agency’s strike on the anti-submarine plane was crucial to attacking the Russian sub in Novorossiysk.\n\nLast week’s footage showed the Kilo-class 636.3 Varshavyanka being engulfed in an explosion while docked at Russia’s southern naval hub. The SBU said it has been “put out of action”.\n\nKilo-class submarines cost about $400m (£296m). The one said to have been hit last week is likely to have been armed with Kalibr cruise missiles, which Moscow has used in long-range strikes.\n\nThe attack, which was the first of its kind, was seen as important symbolically because it took place at Novorossiysk, a naval hub that has taken on greater strategic importance for Russia’s Black Sea Fleet after it was forced to relocate there.\n\nUkraine had driven the naval fleet from its original home port in Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea with a series of marine drone strikes.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "An explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away.\n\nAn official from Ukraine’s military intelligence, known as GUR, told The Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia’s war in Ukraine, without providing details. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nRussian authorities did not comment on who may be behind the attack. Since Moscow invaded nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Kyiv for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them.\n\nOn Wednesday, two traffic police officers were approaching a suspicious individual when a device detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement. The officers and another person standing nearby died from their injuries.\n\nThe Interior Ministry named the officers as Lt. Ilya Klimanov, 24, who joined the Moscow police in October 2023, and Lt. Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Gorbunov had a wife and a 9-month-old daughter, the statement said.\n\nThe blast took place in the same area of the Russian capital where Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday. Sarvarov was the head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff.\n\nInvestigators have said they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind that attack, which was the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. Ukraine has not commented on it.\n\nUkraine — which is outnumbered by Russia’s larger, better equipped military — has frequently tried to change the course of the war by attacking in unexpected ways.\n\nIn August last year, Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region even as they struggled to stem Russian offensives elsewhere. Moscow’s troops eventually drove them out, but the incursion diverted Russian military resources and raised Ukrainian morale.\n\nIn June, swarms of drones launched from trucks targeted bomber bases across Russia.\n\nMoscow has also blamed assassinations on Ukraine. Just over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov’s assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nDays after Moskalik’s killing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes” although he didn’t mention Moskalik’s name.\n\nMeanwhile, Western officials have accused Russia of staging a campaign of disruption and sabotage across Europe as part of an effort to sap support for Ukraine. Moscow has denied the claims.",

    "description": "Ukraine uses ground robots to fire at Russian targets and attack positions while its own soldiers stay at a safer distance.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's military has approved a ground robot adapted for some of the country's most vital grenade launchers, the robot's manufacturer said.\n\nThe autonomous vehicles, also called ground drones or unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), are playing a growing role in Ukraine, helping its military with one of its biggest disadvantages: its much smaller military.\n\nThe robots are used for a host of functions, including firing at Russian targets, blowing up Russian positions, and evacuating the wounded.\n\nBut the company, DevDroid, said this was the first time Ukraine has given this level of authorization to one adapted for these key launchers.\n\nIt wrote on LinkedIn this week that its Droid NW 40 \"is the first codified reconnaissance and strike UGV\" that is adapted for the US-made Mk-19 40mm and the Ukrainian-made AGL-53 automatic grenade launchers.\n\nThe American-made Mk-19 has been an important weapon for NATO militaries over the past few decades. The domestically made AGL-53 was approved by Ukraine's military this year. Both are important for Ukraine as it seeks to modernize and not rely on its Soviet-designed weapons.\n\nDevDroid said the codification means the robot is \"approved for service with the Defense Forces and meets NATO standards.\"\n\nIt said the system is designed to attack personnel and light armored vehicles at a range of 0.9 miles, with remote controls allowing operators to stay back.\n\nIt's not the first time that ground robots have been used to fire grenades in Ukraine. But it appears to be the first time that a design engineered to fire those key grenade launchers has had official approval for use.\n\nUkraine's Ministry of Defense could not be reached for immediate comment.\n\nA Ukrainian unit has shared images of a ground robot equipped with a different grenade launcher, and Oleksandr Yabchanka, the head of the robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that his unit has \"brilliant\" turrets that attach the MK-19 grenade launcher to some of its ground robots.\n\nHe said robots can be fitted with different weapons, like machine guns or grenade launchers, to fire at Russian positions. It means they can attack while keeping Ukrainian soldiers safer, as Russia is likely to return fire to wherever the attack comes from, and can also drive closer to Russian positions to launch the attacks.\n\nHe said ground robot systems are best when they work like Lego, with soldiers able to put the same system together in different ways to perform different functions, rather than having many different systems to use.\n\nUkrainian soldiers are constantly learning new ways to use existing weaponry and encouraging the development of new types. It means innovation can also happen before any official defense ministry involvement.\n\nThe war has been marked by constant innovation, with both large and small defense companies continually developing new types of technology, particularly in the areas of robotics and drones. This includes on the battlefield, where soldiers stay in communication with manufacturers to give feedback and get fast upgrades.\n\nThe way soldiers use some robotic systems has even come as a surprise to the manufacturers themselves, a testament to how rapidly the technology's use is developing.\n\nGround robots account for a tiny portion of Ukraine's drone use. Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said this month that in November, they accounted for less than 0.66% of Ukraine's total drone missions.\n\nAnd it is unclear how widely the Droid NW 40 will be used or how many can be manufactured.\n\nBut dozens of companies are working on the newer and growing tech in Ukraine, where its population is so much smaller than Russia's that it needs systems to allow it to fight without much manpower.\n\nDevDroid itself says that its system allows \"the execution of complex combat missions from a safe distance and minimizing risks to personnel.\"\n\nAnd the robots' achievements are growing too. A Ukrainian unit said on Monday that it used a DevDroid TW 12.7 that was equipped with a .50-caliber machine gun to hold frontline positions for 45 straight days.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine shared new details on Tuesday about a precursor mission for its first underwater drone strike against a Russian submarine, showing how its forces laid the groundwork for its main attack.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, released a video on Tuesday saying that it had first struck an Il-38N reconnaissance aircraft, also known as a Sea Dragon, using an aerial drone carrying an airburst warhead.\n\nThe security agency published footage of a flying drone approaching a Sea Dragon on its runway, saying it was carrying an explosive warhead that disperses over 2,000 fragments toward its target.\n\n\"The detonation occurred directly above the compartment housing the main equipment and radars and also damaged the engine,\" the SBU said.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the time or location of filming. The Russian defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe SBU said that disabling the aircraft was a key prior step for the later, main strike on the Russian submarine.\n\nThe Sea Dragon, which is designed to detect underwater threats, had been \"actively countering the operations of the SBU's maritime drones,\" the security service said.\n\n\"In the Black Sea, the Russians had only one aircraft of this class capable of detecting the 'Sub Sea Baby' underwater drone as it moved toward its target,\" the SBU added.\n\nThe SBU said the attack unfolded at the Yeysk air base.\n\nYeysk sits on the eastern flank of the Sea of Azov across from the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol, and is roughly 140 miles from the port of Novorossiysk.\n\nRussia stations many of its naval assets at this Black Sea port, which is also where the SBU said earlier this month that it attacked a Russian Kilo-class submarine with a Sub Sea Baby.\n\nThe drone is a version of the Sea Baby uncrewed surface vessel — which is equipped with an explosive warhead and designed to ram into its target — that is modified to run underwater.\n\nThe SBU released footage of an explosion near a pier in the port of Novorossiysk, though it's unclear when this video was filmed.\n\nRussia's Black Sea Fleet has denied that the attack caused significant damage to the Kilo-class sub.\n\nThe diesel-electric boat, estimated by Ukraine to be worth $400 million, is designed to carry up to four Kalibr cruise missiles. This precision missile type is often compared to the US Tomahawk and has been used regularly by Russia to attack Ukrainian cities.\n\nUkraine has no official navy of its own, but it has used drones and missiles to harass Russia's Black Sea Fleet and, at times, drive it away.\n\nThe SBU had earlier said that the attacked Kilo-class submarine was in Novorossiysk after retreating from Crimea due to Ukrainian attacks.",

In other cases, they have denied all involvement.\n\nOn Monday, a Russian general was killed by a car bomb in Moscow, and investigators say they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind the attack. Ukraine has not yet commented on the death of Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov.\n\nOther attacks that Russia has blamed on Ukraine include:\n\nKirillov, head of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed alongside his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, when a bomb planted on a scooter exploded outside an apartment building in Moscow in December 2024.\n\nKirillov had been charged in absentia a day earlier by Ukraine’s Security Service, the SBU, with ”ordering the use of banned chemical weapons against Ukraine’s Defense Forces.” The SBU later claimed responsibility for the attack. An Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on the security service’s behalf.\n\nMoskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department of the General Staff, was killed in April 2025. A bomb had been placed underneath his car, which was parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow.\n\nSeveral days after the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement that the country’s Foreign Intelligence Service had informed him of the “elimination of senior command personnel of Russia’s armed forces,” but gave no further details.\n\nA Russian man who previously lived in Ukraine pleaded guilty to carrying out the attack and said that he had been paid by Ukraine's security services.\n\nRzhitsky, a former submarine commander, was gunned down in July 2023 while jogging in Krasnodar, Russia.\n\nUkrainian media reported that Rzhitsky was one of six submarine commanders able to launch the long-range missiles that hit Vinnytsia, Ukraine, a year earlier, killing 23 people and wounding over 100.\n\nWhen he died, Rzhitsky was deputy head of a military mobilization office in Krasnodar.\n\nKyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate, denied Kyiv’s involvement in the death. However, the agency also released details about the killing, including the time of the attack and the number of shots fired. A dual Russian-Ukrainian citizen was convicted in the killing in October 2024.\n\nPrilepin, a nationalist Russian writer, narrowly avoided death in a car bombing in Russia’s Nizhny Novgorod region in May 2023. His driver was killed, while Prilepin was hospitalized with broken bones, bruised lungs and other injuries.\n\nPrilepin, known for his support of the war, was sanctioned by the European Union.\n\nA Ukrainian was found guilty of the attack in a Russian court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Russia’s Investigative Committee accused him of working on orders from Kyiv.\n\nIn an interview with Ukrainian journalists in March 2024, SBU chief Lt. Gen. Vasyl Maliuk declined to take responsibility for the attack, but said he could provide some details, such as Prilepin's injuries.\n\nTatarsky, a military blogger, was killed in April 2023 when a bomb tore through a cafe in central St Petersburg where he had been speaking.\n\nTatarsky supported the war in Ukraine and filed regular reports from the front for his Telegram followers.\n\nDarya Trepova was convicted of the bombing and sentenced to 27 years in prison after she was seen on camera presenting a small statue to Tatarsky that exploded shortly afterward. Trepova testified she didn’t know the gift contained a bomb.\n\nIn the March 2024 interview, SBU chief Maliuk also declined to take responsibility for Tatarsky's death, but describing the blogger as a mouthpiece for Russia who had \"paid a karmic price before the Ukrainian people.” He also provided details on the bomb that killed Tatarsky.\n\nKyva, a Ukrainian lawmaker who fled to Russia shortly after the full-scale invasion, was found dead near Moscow in December 2023 with a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nA controversial political figure in Ukraine before the war, Kyva often appeared on pro-Kremlin TV talk shows. A month before his death, a Ukrainian court found him guilty in absentia of treason and sentenced him to 14 years in prison.\n\nRussia’s state Investigative Committee accused an Armenian-born businessman of passing on details about Kyva’s movements to the SBU, state news agency Tass said. However, no charges have been brought directly related to the killing.\n\nAndriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, said after Kyva’s death that “the same fate will befall other traitors of Ukraine,” but did not say who was behind the killing.\n\nDugina was killed in August 2022 when a remote-controlled bomb planted in her SUV blew up as she drove on Moscow’s outskirts.\n\nHer father, Alexander Dugin, was widely believed to be the intended target. The philosopher, writer and political theorist is an ardent supporter of the war.\n\nUkraine denied responsibility for the attack, with Zelenskyy saying Dugina was “not our responsibility\" and Kyiv was \"not interested in her.”\n\nRussia’s Federal Security Agency, the FSB, publicly identified two Ukrainian citizens as suspects, but said they had escaped abroad.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

Moments later, the drone strikes, hitting the soldier as he attempts to escape. The explosion spooks another horse, which unseats its rider before making a charge in another direction. A third rider is seen, but his fate is unknown.\n\n“Russian occupiers lose so much equipment during their ‘meat-grinder assaults’ that they’re forced to move on horseback,” the 92nd Brigade wrote in a post accompanying the footage.\n\nVladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has been defined by rapid technological advances on the front lines, in particular in drone warfare. Small, off-the-shelf explosive drones have proved effective at defending against mechanised units and infantry.\n\nRussia recently introduced motorbikes and all-terrain vehicles as a way to speed across open countryside monitored by drones.\n\nHorses could offer yet more flexibility – agile on off-road terrain and less likely to trigger modern landmines equipped with magnetic sensors. The first horse-mounted casualty was reported by observers of the war in Ukraine in October.\n\nAt the same time, The Telegraph reported that the Storm unit of Russia’s 9th Brigade of the 51st Army had been preparing horse-mounted assault teams to operate in the Donetsk region.\n\nBefore this, there had been numerous reports of Russia utilising donkeys, horses and even camels to transport ammunition and other heavy equipment to the front line through muddy conditions not suitable for regular vehicles.\n\nThroughout the ages, horseback cavalry charges have provided speed, shock and flexibility on the battlefield.\n\nTanks and other heavily-armoured fighting machines are rarely seen on the battlefields of Ukraine and, when they do appear, they are almost instantly disabled by a wave of drones.\n\nRussia’s Kommersant newspaper said of the return of cavalry: “In armed conflicts that have become arenas for showcasing technological innovations, participants are once again forced to rely on basic tools – from analogue telephone lines to pack animals and carts – when modern technologies prove vulnerable.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

It's going OK,\" Trump said Monday while on vacation at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Asked if he planned to speak to Zelenskyy or Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump didn't say, offering only of the fighting, “I'd like to see it stopped.”\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, said “nearly 90%” of Ukraine’s demands have been incorporated into the draft agreements.\n\nThe backbone of the proposed deal is a 20-point plan, he said. There is also a framework document on security guarantees between Ukraine, European countries, and the United States, as well as a separate document on bilateral security guarantees granted to Ukraine by the U.S.\n\nZelenskyy mentioned several key points, such as the Ukrainian army remaining at a peacetime level of 800,000; membership in the European Union; and European forces, under the leadership of France and the U.K. and with a “backstop” from Washington, ensuring “Ukraine’s security in the air, on land, and at sea.”\n\n“Some key countries will provide presence in these domains; others will contribute to energy security, finance, bomb shelters, and so on,” the Ukrainian president said.\n\nUkraine is arguing that the bilateral document with the U.S. should be reviewed by the U.S. Congress, with some details and annexes kept classified, Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe U.S. team is now in talks with Russian envoys, and Washington has asked that no details be released, he added.\n\nUkraine strikes deep inside Russia\n\nZelenskyy said Monday he met with his military commanders who reported that defensive lines are holding firm against the Russian onslaught.\n\n“In (recent) weeks, the Russian army has significantly increased the intensity of attacks, and the number of Russian losses has increased accordingly,” he said in a post on Telegram.\n\nUkrainian forces hit an oil terminal, a pipeline, two parked jet fighters and two ships in a series of strikes on Russian soil, officials said Monday.\n\nThe attacks are part of an ongoing campaign to disrupt the Russian war effort and sow fear behind the front line, where outnumbered Ukrainian troops are straining to hold back Russia’s bigger army.\n\nThe strikes also seek to undermine Putin’s attempt to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of military strength in U.S.-led peace efforts, which have yet to make a breakthrough on key points.\n\nThe killing of a top Russian general by a car bomb in Moscow on Monday, with investigators suspecting Ukraine was behind it, could be another instance of Kyiv picking surprise targets.\n\nUkrainian partisans burn Russian fighter jets\n\nUkrainian forces struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, an ammunition depot and a launch site for attack drones inside Russian territory and Russian-held Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s General Staff said in a statement Monday.\n\nA pipeline, two docks and two ships were damaged in the southern Krasnodar region, and a large blaze broke out, the statement said, without specifying what kind of weapons were used in the attack.\n\nIt added that a Ukrainian-made missile also hit a temporary base for Russia's 92nd River Boat Brigade in Olenivka, in the occupied Crimean Peninsula.\n\nA separate strike targeted an ammunition depot in a Russian-controlled portion of the Donetsk region, aiming to slow the Russian advance there, the General Staff said. A Russian launch site for attack drones was also hit.\n\nUkrainian partisans set fire to two Russian jet fighters in an operation on Sunday evening at a base near Lipetsk, a city in western Russia, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense said only that its forces shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight, three of them over the Krasnodar region.\n\nRussia targets the power grid again\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces kept up their targeting of Ukraine’s energy sector, aiming to deprive civilians of heat and running water during the frigid winter. Russia has tried to knock out power in Ukraine throughout the war, in a tactic that Ukraine refers to as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nEnergy infrastructure across five regions were attacked during the night, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 86 drones of different types overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Ukrainian forces stopped 58 of them, it said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Ukraine said it destroyed two more Russian fighter jets by sneaking into an airfield hangar over the weekend, estimating the destroyed aircrafts' combined worth at up to $100 million.\n\nThe hits add to the large haul of Russian jets Ukraine says it has been able to strike even at bases hundreds of miles from the front lines. Business Insider was not able to independently verify Ukraine's claim.\n\nUkraine's destruction of aircraft has hampered Russia's ability to be effective in the air in its invasion of Ukraine. It has also caused concern among Western militaries about how well they can protect their own assets if potential adversaries like Russia and China were to use similar tactics against them.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence directorate (GUR) reported the kill on Monday, saying its operation put two Russian Su-30 aircraft out of action.\n\nIt shared video footage that appeared to be filmed inside a hangar, showing two aircraft tail numbers, the inside of a cockpit, and flames inside at least one aircraft.\n\nA post shared by Головне управління розвідки МО України (@diukraine)\n\nThe GUR said an agent was able to enter an airfield near the city of Lipetsk in western Russia, attack the jets in the hangar, and then leave the airfield unnoticed as a result of studying its patrol route and guard change schedule.\n\nThe Su-30 is a Soviet-designed, twin-engine fighter jet. The GUR originally said that a Su-30 and a Su-27 were hit, but later revised its information to say that it was two Su-30s.\n\nThe GUR did not give details on how the attack was carried out.\n\nIt said the attack was planned for two weeks and conducted by an agent connected to the resistance movement that opposes Russia's invasion. There are multiple resistance groups in Russia and in Russian-occupied Ukraine that oppose the war and that have claimed sabotage attacks on Russia.\n\nUkraine has previously been able to destroy Russian jets by getting personnel close to Russian air bases. Earlier this year, it sneaked more than one hundred drones into Russian territory and launched them near key airbases, hitting dozens of aircraft in its Operation Spiderweb.\n\nThat sparked concern over how the West can protect its air assets, including ones close to China.\n\nUkraine also claimed another big win this weekend, with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Saturday saying that drones struck two Russian Su-27 jets on an airfield. Business Insider was not able to independently verify Ukraine's claim of this attack.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has been a fierce battle for control of the air, with neither side able to gain full air superiority. That has contributed to the war now being a slow-moving battle, with neither military able to easily launch large attacks on or bomb the other's positions.\n\nUkraine has used new and innovative means to hit Russian aircraft, including by developing long-range drones and naval drones, which it said have destroyed Russian jets in a historic first.\n\nRussia has also been able to destroy Ukrainian jets throughout the war, and it has demonstrated its own capability to conduct long-range attacks. It sends huge barrages of drones and missiles across Ukraine, hitting both military and civilian targets.\n\nThe war has also been a wake-up call for the West. The West has not fought a war like this in decades and instead has been in conflicts, like counter-insurgency operations, where it has had big advantages over its adversaries, particularly in the air.\n\nThe West, since the end of the Cold War, has not heavily invested in the kinds of ground-based air defense that are key to stopping the attacks common in this war. Investment in them is now a priority for NATO.\n\nAnother problem for the West is that this war shows how cheap drones, worth thousands of dollars, can destroy aircraft and other advanced weaponry worth millions.\n\nThe types of air defenses that the US and its allies have focused on for decades are unsustainable. For example, one interceptor missile for the US-made Patriot air defense system costs $7 million. Firing dozens of those to stop an attack by cheap drones is a position no Western military wants to be in.\n\nNATO is eyeing up far cheaper defenses to stop drone attacks and protect assets like bases, learning from some of the tech Ukraine has developed.",

    "title": "Ukraine's trench war runs on an easily overlooked weapon: grenades",
    "description": "Soldiers in Ukraine say that grenades are key for close-quarters trench fighting, and Western forces are paying attention.",
    "fullText": "Grenades — a standard but often unglamorous part of modern infantry combat — have become indispensable in Ukraine's close-quarters and grueling fight against Russia's invasion.\n\nThe war blends advanced technologies like drones and electronic warfare with grinding, World War I-style fighting, where soldiers sometimes battle at arm's length in muddy trenches and bunkers. In those confined spaces, Ukrainian and Russian troops alike rely heavily on grenades.\n\nWestern officials and war veterans in Ukraine told Business Insider about the important role they play in Ukraine's trench warfare. Their use has also evolved, with grenades increasingly getting tactical upgrades, including adaptations for drone drops and components made with 3D printing.\n\nThe experience has highlighted a lesson for Western militaries less accustomed to modern trench fighting, the kind of combat that drives enormous demand for basic infantry munitions like grenades.\n\nUkraine's battlefield is littered with trenches unlike anything the West has seen for decades, with soldiers needing hides and defenses from the attack and surveillance drones that fly overhead, and the brutal fighting involves defending and taking these earthworks from the enemy.\n\nA US veteran who fought in Ukraine and spoke with Business Insider on the condition of anonymity said that \"when you go through these trenches, hand grenades are your best fucking friends.\"\n\nHe said the fights are so close-quarters that in some engagements with the Russians, \"you could literally touch them with the muzzle of your rifle at times.\"\n\nTrenches are messy, uneven, and difficult to capture. \"You're basically trying to take the home of another individual who's lived there for days, weeks, months at this point,\" the vet said. \"So they know every nook and cranny; they know every turn.\"\n\nA British man who fought for Ukraine previously told Business Insider that he carried grenades for both assault and reconnaissance missions and described the US and UK-made grenades as \"prized\" among Ukrainians.\n\nLt. Col. Davidson, a leader in the UK-led training program for Ukrainian soldiers called Operation Interflex, told Business Insider last year on the condition that only his rank and last name be used that \"Ukrainians have got a heavy use of grenades.\" That usage was worked into the training in response.\n\nThere is a wide range of grenades in use in battle, everything from fragmentation and explosive to flashbang and chemical.\n\nA Ukrainian officer recently told Business Insider that smoke grenades can help to create poor visibility so injured soldiers can be evacuated, though it can also risk drawing unwanted Russian attention.\n\nCombat video footage shared by Ukrainian units often shows grenades in action, including footage of US volunteers using them in an assault on a Russian trench.\n\nUkraine's grenades come from multiple sources, from old Soviet-era stocks to those of partner nations.\n\nA January 2025 Department of Defense update said the US had provided \"more than 50,000 grenade launchers and small arms\" and \"more than 500,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition and grenades\" to Ukraine. And the US isn't the only supplier. The volume supplied reflects how central these weapons are to front-line combat. Ukraine also makes its own grenades.\n\nIt's not alone, though. Russia is also heavily using these weapons, including in the booby traps it sets up in trenches and urban environments.\n\nUkraine feels it when it has shortages of grenades. Another US veteran told Business Insider on the condition of anonymity last year that, with US aid stalled and Ukraine suffering weaponry shortages, he was often told to be \"careful practicing with grenades\" so as not to waste too many.\n\nAnd when it was time to swap positions, troops taking over would ask those departing to leave any remaining grenades and ammunition.\n\n\"That's how desperate that situation got to where it's like guys were literally getting ammo and grenades off of dudes leaving the area so that they could keep fighting.\"\n\nGrenades have long been a staple of infantry combat, including in the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But Ukraine's conflict has pushed their use to levels more typical of large-scale, attritional warfare, where trench systems stretch for miles and fighting drags on for months and years.\n\nWestern militaries did not anticipate the return of large-scale trench warfare, and in Ukraine that fighting has pushed grenades to the center of daily front-line combat.\n\nLong a standard tool in close-quarters fighting, they have become especially prominent amid widespread trenches, ammunition shortages, and evolving tactics.\n\nWhile they're being used in close-quarters combat, grenades are also being dropped from drones in battles all along the front lines, hitting soldiers, bunkers, hideouts, and even vehicles.\n\nVery recent footage from Novopavlivka front, drone dropping grenade RIGHT INTO RUSSIAN TANK HATCH.\n\nIt falls right into the hatch, destroying the tank from the inside.\n\nHonestly, tanks were so rare this year at the battlefield, and this is just BEAUTIFUL to watch. pic.twitter.com/Ns4NKBH2Qp\n\nA US Army Colonel said doing this has \"proved dramatically effective\" for Ukraine. The Army first tested dropping a live grenade from a drone this year. It's catching up.\n\nUkrainian units and engineers are also 3D-printing parts to make old grenades work better with drones while printing plastic casings to fill with explosives to make custom grenades.\n\nWorried about Russia sparking a wider war with Europe, much of the West is watching to see what lessons it can learn from Ukraine.\n\nMaj. Maguire, a British military officer who led part of the Operation Interflex training and helped document lessons from Ukraine, told Business Insider that the scale and importance of grenade use in trench fighting have stood out. He spoke on the condition that only his rank and last name be used.\n\n\"There's a massive demand for grenades,\" he said.\n\nThe West is looking at trench warfare more, too, and rethinking how messy and dangerous trenches can be and the weapons needed for a fight.\n\nUkraine's war has shown that even on a high-tech battlefield, sustained close combat in trenches still depends on basic infantry weapons and on having enough of them.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — A car bomb killed a Russian general on Monday, the third such killing of a senior military officer in a year. Investigators said Ukraine may be behind the attack.\n\nLt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, died from his injuries, said Svetlana Petrenko, the spokesperson for Russia’s Investigative Committee, the nation's top criminal investigation agency.\n\n“Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder. One of these is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services,” Petrenko said.\n\nSince Moscow sent troops into Ukraine nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Ukraine for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them. It has not yet commented on Monday's death.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Vladimir Putin had been immediately informed about Sarvarov's killing.\n\nThe Defense Ministry said that Sarvarov had previously fought in Chechnya and taken part in Moscow's military campaign in Syria.\n\nJust over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov's assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAn Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on behalf of the Ukrainian security service.\n\nPutin described Kirillov’s killing as a “major blunder” by Russia’s security agencies, noting they should learn from it and improve their efficiency.\n\nIn April, another senior Russian military officer, Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the General Staff, was killed by an explosive device placed in his car parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow. A suspected perpetrator was quickly arrested.\n\nDays after Moskalik's killing, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes\" although he didn't mention Moskalik's name.",

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has responded with sharp criticism to Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands for new elections in his country.\n\n\"It is not for Putin to decide when and in what format elections take place in Ukraine,\" he said at a press conference in Kiev during a visit by Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro. He promised that Putin would not be able to influence a possible vote on the future Ukrainian president.\n\nThe criticism was triggered by Putin's statements on Friday at his annual press conference, where he not only once again demanded presidential elections in the neighbouring country he invaded and criticized the current Ukrainian leadership as illegitimate, but also insisted that Ukrainians living in Russia should participate in the vote.\n\nPutin said there are between 5 million and 10 million Ukrainians in Russia. There are no diplomatic missions of Ukraine in Russia, where citizens abroad would normally vote. Putin's election official, Ella Pamfilova, said that the Russian authorities could organize the voting there.\n\nNo elections in Russia and occupied territories\n\n\"Ukrainian citizens who are in Ukraine in the Ukrainian-controlled areas will vote,\" Zelensky said in response.\n\nOnly there could honest and transparent elections be guaranteed, he said. In addition, there is the usual practice of voting in foreign missions.\n\n\"In the areas not controlled by Ukraine, no elections can be held because it is clear that they would be conducted there as Russia always does,\" he said, referring to international criticism of the questionable fairness of elections in Russia.\n\nMartial law prohibits elections during wartime\n\nPutin, who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has repeatedly stated since last year that Zelensky is no longer legitimate due to his expired term.\n\nKiev, however, points to martial law, which prohibits elections during wartime, thereby extending Zelensky's term. Internationally, Zelensky is still recognized as the Ukrainian president.\n\nRecently, however, US President Donald Trump adopted Putin's demand for new elections in Ukraine. Zelensky expressed his willingness to do so but demanded a ceasefire during the election to ensure the security of the vote.\n\nPutin's re-election in March 2024 was also sharply criticized as illegitimate in Western countries. The German government, for instance, classified the vote as \"neither free nor fair.\"\n\nReal opposition candidates were not allowed, there was a climate of intimidation, and there is no freedom of expression, said the then spokeswoman Christiane Hoffmann. Russia, she said, is now a dictatorship.",

    "description": "The Ukrainian drone schools training operators for the fight with Russia take safety steps like giving staff polygraph tests and hiding.",
    "fullText": "The leaders of several drone schools training Ukraine's operators for the fight against Russia say they're targets and they have to act accordingly — tightly protecting information and even moving around.\n\nThroughout its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has launched huge drone and missile barrages at factories, training sites, and civilian infrastructure across the country, often far from the fighting in the east, straining Ukrainian defenses and serving as a constant reminder that nowhere in the country is completely safe.\n\nDrones are prolific on the battlefield in Ukraine. Operators are priority targets. It stands to reason the schools training them for war would be too. Officials from three drone schools told Business Insider that they take steps to avoid getting hit.\n\nTetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, said that it must follow strict safety rules because \"the entirety of Ukraine is not safe, missile-wise, drone-wise.\"\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, told BI the safety measures, including not disclosing publicly exactly where its training centers are located and also changing their location \"from time to time,\" are necessary to prevent Russia from interfering with its training\n\nTo keep certain location data from getting out, the school doesn't allow photos and videos that might reveal where its facilities are based.\n\nThe school has been mentioned by Russia's military bloggers, influential pro-war accounts that often circulate operational details and commentary to large audiences. Though they are typically in favor of the war, they are also sometimes critical of Russia's performance and dispute some of its defense ministry's claims.\n\nRybar, a media outlet with 1.5 million Telegram subscribers, listed Dronarium as an example of Ukraine's drone training efforts. The UK has sanctioned Rybar, initially presented as a milblogger but actually a partially Russian government-sponsored information warfare operation, and the US has offered up to $10 million for information.\n\nTetyana said Russian outlets have been writing about the school since 2022, the year Russia started its full-scale invasion. \"As long as they write and talk about us, it means that they are afraid of us,\" she said. But it also means that they're on Russia's radar.\n\nShe said the school and its attendees strictly adhere to a set of critical cybersecurity rules, and said there are also general safety rules in place. \"When the air raid siren is on, all training activities, all the work, everything gets suspended, and we deconcentrate and get into safe shelters.\" She said no one is complacent.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that safety steps are crucial because \"the Russians are constantly hunting for places where military personnel gather.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have confirmed that Russia has hit some Ukrainian military training sites, killing personnel. It's the kind of thing air defenses can try to prevent, but Ukraine has suffered shortages throughout the war. Ukraine has also successfully hit Russian bases and gatherings of Russian personnel.\n\nThe key is to prevent Russia from gaining sufficient knowledge of the school to target it. Its steps include \"everyone who works at KK&A, including the cleaners,\" having to do a polygraph security interview.\n\nHe said they don't share any information about the location of the training center or about the appearance of the instructors or cadets.\n\n\"Some of our employees may have relatives or acquaintances in occupied territories who could be tortured by Russians for indirect contact with someone who opposes Russia,\" Pervak said. \"This secrecy also protects the instructors and cadets themselves, as well as their relatives, from attacks by Russian agents.\"\n\nHe said that while the added security \"hinders publicity to some extent — good things should be spoken about loudly — war dictates its own conditions. We are well aware that failing to observe the principles of secrecy may result in the death of staff or cadets.\"\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, said that \"Russia is interested in destroying us.\"\n\n\"Thanks to God and air defence, we're still operating.\"",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — President Vladimir Putin emphasized Friday that Moscow’s troops were advancing across the battlefield in Ukraine and voiced confidence the Kremlin would achieve its goals militarily if Kyiv doesn't agree to Russia's conditions in peace talks.\n\nSpeaking at his tightly orchestrated annual news conference that lasted about 4 1/2 hours, Putin declared that Russian forces have “fully seized strategic initiative” and would make more gains by year's end.\n\nIn the early days of the conflict in 2022, Ukraine's forces thwarted an attempt by Russia’s larger, better-equipped army, to capture the capital of Kyiv. But the fighting soon settled into grinding battles, and Moscow's troops have made slow and steady progress over the years. Putin frequently touts this progress — even though it's not the lightning advance many expected.\n\n“Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,” Putin said at the live news conference, which is combined with a nationwide call-in show that offers Russians across the country the opportunity to ask questions of their leader.\n\nPutin, 73, has ruled the country for 25 years and uses the event to cement his power and air his views on domestic and global affairs during a broadcast that mixes criticism of the West with promises of more social payments. Although he is sometimes asked about his personal life, he gives scant details.\n\nThis year, the news conference took place against the backdrop of a peace plan in Ukraine put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump. Despite the extensive diplomatic push, Washington’s efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nWhile the event has previously focused heavily on domestic questions — and has offered Putin a chance to expound on topics from the price of eggs to water cuts — Ukraine dominated it this year. Since it is highly choreographed, that could reflect the Kremlin’s desire to assuage the public after nearly four years of fighting.\n\nRussian demands remain unchanged\n\nPutin praised Trump's peace efforts and reaffirmed that Moscow was ready for a peaceful settlement that would address the “root causes” of the conflict, a reference to the Kremlin’s tough conditions for a deal. He said he has agreed to make “certain compromises” and “uneasy decisions” at the Alaska summit with Trump in August but didn't elaborate.\n\nHe wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He has also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured yet. Kyiv has publicly rejected all these demands.\n\nThe Kremlin has also insisted that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance members and would view them as “legitimate target.”\n\nPutin also has repeatedly said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language — demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members. But at the same time, he has emphasized that Ukraine believes NATO membership remains the best security guarantee.\n\n″The United States don’t see us in NATO, for now,\" Zelenskyy said this week. “Politicians change.”\n\nCommenting on Zelenskyy's statement that he was ready to call a presidential election if a ceasefire is established, Putin responded that Russia has held elections without demanding a truce. He said that Moscow was ready to consider the issue and could agree to halt attacks deep inside Ukraine on the election day, but noted that millions of Ukrainians living in Russia must have the right to vote. Ukraine introduced martial law banning elections, but Russia hasn't made such a move.\n\nPutin rebuffed Western claims about purported Russian plans to attack European nations as “sheer nonsense” aimed at deflecting public attention from domestic problems.\n\nHe particularly singled out NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for his statements about the Kremlin's aggressive intentions, pointing out Trump's recently published national security strategy that doesn’t name Russia as a direct adversary. “How can you prepare NATO for a war with Russia if the main member of NATO doesn't consider us as an enemy?” Putin said.\n\nHe alleged that European elites “impudently” backed Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and now hope the U.S. political landscape will change after the midterm elections to Congress, helping raise pressure on the White House.\n\nPutin says seizing Russian assets will backfire\n\nAs it faces grinding Russian advances across the front line and relentless attacks on its energy facilities, Ukraine desperately cash infusions from its Western allies.\n\nOn Friday, European Union leaders agreed to provide a massive interest-free loan, but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.\n\nThe leaders tried to reassure Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, that they would protect it from any retaliation from Moscow if it backed the plan, but the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.\n\nUsing Russian assets to help Kyiv would have amounted to “robbery,” Putin said, adding that the move would have spooked investors, “dealing not only an image blow but undermining confidence in the eurozone.”\n\nPutin says troop numbers are strong\n\nPutin said the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, topping 400,000 this year. It was not possible to independently verify that claim since little is known about the recruitment effort.\n\nBut the government offers relatively high pay and extensive benefits that have helped swell troop ranks. The Kremlin says it exclusively relies on volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but some media reports and rights groups have said that military officers often coerce conscripts into signing military contracts.\n\nAsked by a soldier’s widow about slow pension payments, Putin apologized and vowed the issue would be quickly resolved — a typical exchange at the annual event, which he often uses to show his command of a wide array of subjects and his ability to solve problems.\n\nThe news conference featured questions from journalists in the Gostinny Dvor amphitheater as well as via video links from across Russia. A young man in a red bow tie who held a placard saying he wanted to get married used his question to Putin to propose to his girlfriend. Later, one of the anchors hosting the event reported that she had answered “yes,” and Putin joked about collecting money for the wedding.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine’s dramatic escalation of its sea-drone attacks on tankers carrying Russian oil could spread to the English Channel, experts have warned.\n\nThe hit on an Oman-flagged tanker on Friday widened the Ukrainian operation from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, signalling that sanctioned tankers could be hit anywhere on their journey.\n\n“The Ukrainians are now operating across a much wider area. If you’re a shadow fleet vessel then there’s now a risk wherever you are,” said Matthew Wright, of trade intelligence firm Kpler.\n\n“You get shadow fleet vessels that come out of the Baltic Sea, they are essentially going through the North Sea. The threat to them is now higher.”\n\nMichelle Bockmann, from maritime data company Windward, said the Ukrainians were likely to continue focusing on empty tankers rather than those laden with oil, but the attacks could impose massive costs on the vessel operators.\n\nShe added: “Marine insurers have been saying for quite a while now that one of these vessels, if they have a casualty, especially if they go through the English Channel, that they’re a billion-dollar marine accident waiting to happen.\n\n“Ukraine is aware of this risk, and I think that’s why this is a new strategy, an evolving strategy, and definitely one to watch.”\n\nThere are close to 1,000 tankers involved in Russia’s shadow fleet – the vessels, often false-flagged and with obscure ownership, that ferry crude or refined Russian oil to customers primarily in India and China.\n\nAbout 600 carry exclusively Russian oil, which puts them within the Western sanctions net. Roughly another 350 carry Russian oil alongside other cargo.\n\nUkraine has carried out drone attacks on three shadow tankers in the Black Sea in the past month, and is also thought to have been behind an apparent limpet-mine explosion off the coast of Senegal.\n\nExperts said the broadening attacks could prompt some vessel owners to question whether the risk of working for Vladimir Putin was still worth the reward.\n\nThe attacks could drive up ship owners’ insurance premiums. The insurers are believed to be mostly Russian or Chinese, and Kpler said operators might start to worry about whether they would get a payout if attacked.\n\nKpler’s Mr Wright said: “The London insurance market is incredibly well capitalised. It can handle a lot of large claims because the risk is spread. Whereas we don’t have a lot of visibility of how well capitalised the insurers are who cover the Russian shadow fleet.\n\n“If you’re a shadow fleet owner, you’d be asking whether you might get paid out. It will make a lot of the owners who have been leading players in the shadow fleet think about whether the risk-reward is worth it.”\n\nThe vessel owners could react to the bigger risks by raising the prices they charge Russia, further squeezing the Kremlin’s war chest.\n\nUkrainian security sources told local media this calculus made these tankers fair game.\n\n“The aggressor state used this tanker to circumvent sanctions and earn money that was used for the war against Ukraine,” the sources were quoted as saying.\n\n“Therefore ... this is an absolutely legitimate target. The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop, and will beat him anywhere in the world.”\n\nThe Ukrainian action underscores the extent to which civilian tankers have become involved in geopolitical conflict and tension this year, with the US also blockading oil-freight traffic around Venezuela.\n\nMs Bockmann said this blurring of the line between the commercial and military domains was making the industry “uneasy”.\n\nArsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the UN’s International Maritime Organisation, this week urged restraint.\n\n“As the situation continues to escalate in the Black Sea, I call on all parties to refrain from targeting innocent seafarers, port workers and merchant ships,” he said.\n\n“Shipping should not be used as collateral in geopolitical situations and there is an increased environmental risk developing.”\n\nThe Ukrainians appear to be targeting only empty tankers, to avoid triggering an environmental disaster.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — The young journalist in a red bow tie stood during President Vladimir Putin's annual news conference Friday and displayed a sign saying he wanted to get married. But his main question wasn't directed at Putin — it was to his girlfriend, Olga, proposing marriage.\n\nPutin complimented Kirill Bazhanov of Yekaterinburg’s Channel 4 on his snazzy tie, saying, \"You’re ready to go to the registry office!” Bazhanov told Putin “we’d be very glad to see you at the wedding.”\n\nThe Russian leader’s year-end media session had serious questions, of course, about late pension payments, construction projects gone wrong, and the fighting in Ukraine, where Putin sent troops nearly four years ago.\n\nBut every year — amid the weighty questions from the domestic and international media — there are also odd and lighter moments, like this year when people asked Putin what his license plate number was and whether love at first sight existed.\n\nIt’s all part of the spectacle of the tightly orchestrated event — an opportunity for Putin, who has ruled Russia for 25 years, to expound on a wide array of subjects as well as to burnish his image as a fatherly figure to address the concerns of ordinary Russians who submit questions in advance.\n\nBazhanov did actually have a question for Putin — about greater support for young families. Later in the 4 1/2-hour news conference, one of the anchors passed along the news that Bazhanov's girlfriend had said yes. Putin promptly quipped about collecting money for the wedding.\n\nFor those inside Moscow’s Gostinny Dvor amphitheater, the most important task was to get Putin's attention. Most brought signs and some wore national dress. One reporter brought a clutch of Labubu dolls personalized to look like Russian officials and one in the form of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nOne reporter asked whether a comet approaching Earth could be a UFO, and reassured Putin that the city of Tyumen would be ready to welcome any extraterrestrial guests.\n\nPutin seemed unfazed throughout, although Tajik journalist Shamsudin Boboyev caused a brief commotion when he tried to give Putin a book. Two security officials quickly stopped him from going onstage, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested Boboyev should simply describe the gift, which would be given to him later.\n\nToward the end of the session, a journalist who noted that Putin had said earlier he believed in love at first sight asked him if he was in love. The Russian leader, whose private life remains closely guarded, answered simply, “Yes.”\n\nDavies reported from Manchester, England.",

    "description": "A source in the Security Service of Ukraine told Business Insider that the attack was carried out more than 1,240 miles away.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range drones to strike an oil tanker said to be part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time, a security source told Business Insider on Friday.\n\nThe attack, carried out over 1,240 miles from Ukrainian territory, represents a dramatic expansion of Kyiv's push to target Russia's vast energy sector, a key source of revenue fueling its war machine.\n\nUkraine had previously limited its attacks to land-based targets, such as oil refineries and port infrastructure. In recent weeks, though, it has begun striking tankers in the Black Sea and facilities in the Caspian Sea — and now it's hitting targets in the Mediterranean.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, called the drone attack an \"unprecedented special operation\" that targeted and critically damaged the tanker Qendil. The source was only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe SBU source said the Qendil wasn't carrying any oil cargo at the time of the attack, so there isn't any risk to the environment. Footage shows several explosions on the exterior of the tanker.\n\nPublicly available ship-tracking data show that the Qendil was sailing under the flag of Oman. It's unclear when the attack took place; the vessel last reported its location on Friday sailing off the coast of Libya in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy immediately responded to a request for comment on the attack.\n\nUkraine has attacked at least four tankers, including the Qendil, that have been identified as belonging to the \"shadow fleet\" since late November. There are hundreds of vessels in the fleet, which Moscow relies on to transport oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports.\n\nRussia used the Qendil \"to circumvent sanctions and earn money that went to the war against Ukraine,\" the SBU source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider, calling the ship a \"legitimate target\" for the SBU.\n\nThe enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop and will beat him anywhere in the world, wherever he is,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drone strikes to target Russian energy infrastructure in an effort to squeeze a key source of revenue for Moscow. While the campaign initially focused on land-based facilities, Kyiv has recently expanded it to maritime targets, hitting oil tankers in the Black and Mediterranean seas and striking three oil platforms in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe expansion to maritime targets appears to reflect a shift in Kyiv's strategy as it continues to press its international partners to be more aggressive in clamping down on Russian oil exports.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the ongoing deep-strike campaign as \"long-range\" sanctions against Moscow. These operations have been a bright spot for Kyiv as it faces incremental — but costly — Russian gains on the battlefield.",
